sahara limit
sir robert aylward bart mp sat in hi offic in the citi of
london it wa a veri magnific offic quit on of the finest that
could be found within half a mile of the mansion hous it exterior
wa built of aberdeen granit a materi calcul to impress the
prospect investor with a comfort sens of secur other stucco
or even brickbuilt offic might crumbl and fall in an actual or a
financi sens but thi rocklik edific of granit surmount by a
lifes statu of justic with her scale admir from either corner
by pleas effigi of commerc and of industri would sure endur
ani shock earthquak could scarc shake it strong foundat panic
and disast would as soon affect the bank of england that at least
wa the impress which it had been design to convei and not without
success
there is so much in extern mr champershaswel sir robert
partner would sai in hi cheer voic we ar all of us influenc
by them howev unconsci impress the public my dear aylward let
solemn without suggest opul within and the bread or rather the
granit which you throw upon the water will come back to you after
mani dai
mr aylward for thi convers occur befor hi merit or the
depth of hi purs had been reward by a baronetci look at hi
partner in the impass fashion for which he wa famou and answer
you mix your metaphor haswel but if you mean that the public ar
fool who must be caught by advertis i agre with you onli thi
particular advertis is expens and i do not want to wait mani
dai for my reward howev 20000 on wai or the other is a small
matter so tell that architect to do the thing in granit
sir robert aylward sat in hi own quiet room at the back of thi
endur build a veri splendid room that ani secretari of state
might have envi but arrang in excel tast it wall were
panel with figur teak a rich carpet made the footfal noiseless
an antiqu venu stood upon a marbl pedest in the corner and over
the mantelpiec hung a fine portrait by gainsborough that of a certain
miss aylward a famou beauti in her dai with whom be it ad it
present owner could boast no connect whatsoev
sir robert wa seat at hi eboni desk plai with a pencil and the
light from a cheer fire fell upon hi face
in it own wai it wa a remark face as he appear then in hi
fourth and fortieth year veri pale but with a natur pallor veri well
cut and on the whole impress hi ey were dark match hi black
hair and point beard and hi nose wa straight and rather promin
perhap the mouth wa hi weakest featur for there wa a certain
shifti about it also the lip were thick and slightli sensuou
sir robert knew thi and therefor he grew a moustach to veil them
somewhat to a care observ the gener impress given by thi
face wa such as is left by the sudden sight of a waxen mask how
strong how lifelik he would have said but of cours it isnt
real there mai be a man behind or there mai be wood but that onli
a mask mani peopl of percept had felt like thi about sir robert
aylward name that under the mask of hi pale counten dwelt a
differ be whom thei did not know or appreci
if these had seen him at thi moment of the open of our stori thei
might have held that wisdom wa justifi of her children for now
in the solitud of hi splendid offic of a sudden sir robert mask
seem to fall from him hi face broke up like ic beneath a thaw he
rose from hi tabl and began to walk up and down the room he talk to
himself aloud
great heaven he mutter what a game to have plai and it will
go through i believ that it will go through
he stop at the tabl switch on an electr light and made a rapid
calcul on the back of a letter with a blue pencil
ye he said that my share a million and seventeen thousand
pound in cash and two million in ordinari share which can be work
off at a discountlet us sai anoth seven hundr and fifti thousand
plu what i have got alreadyput that at onli two hundr and fifti
thousand net two million in all which of cours mai or mai not be
ad to probabl not unless the ordinari boom for i dont mean
to specul ani more that the end of twenti year work robert
aylward and to think of it eighteen month ago although i seem so
rich i wa on the verg of bankruptcyth veri verg not worth five
thousand pound now what did the trick i wonder what did the trick
he walk down the room and stop opposit the ancient marbl stare
at it
not venu i think he said with a laugh venu never made ani man
rich he turn and retrac hi step to the other end of the room
which wa veil in shadow here upon a second marbl pedest stood an
object that gleam dimli through the gloom it wa about ten inch or
a foot high but in that place noth more could be seen of it except
that it wa yellow and had the gener appear of a toad for some
reason it seem to attract sir robert aylward for he halt to stare
at it then stretch out hi hand and switch on anoth lamp in the
hard brillianc of which the thing upon the pedest suddenli declar
itself leap out of the dark into light it wa a terribl
object a monstros of indetermin sex and natur but surmount by
a woman head and face of extraordinari if devilish loveli sunk
back between high but grotesqu small shoulder like to those of a
lizard so that it glare upward the workmanship of the thing wa
rude yet strang power whatev there is cruel whatev there
is devilish whatev there is inhuman in the dark place of the world
shone out of the jewel ey which were set in that yellow femal
face yellow becaus it substanc wa of gold a face which seem not
to belong to the embryon leg beneath for bodi there wa none but
to float abov them a hollow lifes mask with two tini froglik
leg that wa the fashion of it
you ar an ugli brute mutter sir robert contempl thi effigi
but although i believ in noth in heaven abov or earth below
except the abysm folli of the british public i am bother if i dont
believ in you at ani rate from the dai when vernon brought you into
my offic my luck turn and to judg from the smile on your sweet
counten i dont think it is done with yet i wonder what those
stone ar in your ey opal i suppos from the wai thei chang
colour thei shine uncommonli todai i never rememb them so bright
i
at thi moment a knock came on the door sir robert turn off the lamp
and walk back to the fireplac
come in he said and as he spoke onc more hi pale face grew
impass and expressionless
the door open and a clerk enter an imposinglook clerk with
irongrei hair who wore an irreproach frock coat and patent leather
boot advanc to hi master he stood respectfulli silent wait to
be address for quit a long while sir robert look over hi head as
though he did not see him it wa a wai of hi then hi ey rest on
the man dreamili and he remark in hi cold clear voic
i dont think i rang jeffrei

royalti but there is a littl matter about that articl in the
cynic
press busi said sir robert lift hi eyebrow you should
know by thi time that i do not attend to such detail see mr
champershaswel or major vernon
thei ar both out at the moment sir robert
go on then jeffrei repli the head of the firm with a resign
sigh onli be brief i am think
the clerk bow again
the cynic peopl have just telephon through about that articl we
sent them i think you saw it sir and you mai rememb it begin
and he read from a typewritten copi in hi hand which wa head sahara
limit
we ar now privileg to announc that thi mighti scheme which will
turn a desert into a roll sea bear the commerc of nation and
caus the wast place of the earth to teem with popul and to
blossom like the rose ha been complet in it necessari if dull
financi detail and will within a few dai be submit to investor
among whom it ha alreadi caus so much excit these detail we
will deal with fulli in succeed articl and therefor now need onli
paus to sai that the basi of capit strike us as wonderfulli
advantag to the fortun public who ar ask to particip in
it vast prospect prosper our present object is to speak of it
nation and imperi aspect
sir robert lift hi ey in remonstr
how much more of that exceedingli dull and commonplac puff do you
propos to read jeffrei he ask
no more sir robert we ar pai the cynic thirti guinea to insert
thi articl and the point is that thei sai that if thei have to put in
the nation and imperi busi thei must have twenti more
inde jeffrei why
becaus sir roberti will tell you as you alwai like to hear the
truththeir advertisementeditor is of opinion that sahara limit is a
nation and imperi swindl he sai that he wont drag the nation and
the empir into it in an editori under fifti guinea
a faint smile flicker on sir robert face
doe he inde he ask i wonder at hi moder had i been
in hi place i should have ask more for realli the style is a littl
flamboy well we dont want to quarrel with them just nowfe the
shark but sure jeffrei you didnt come to disturb me about such a
trifl
not altogeth sir robert there is someth more import the
daili judg not onli declin to put ani articl whatsoev but
refus our advertis and state that it mean to critic the
prospectu trenchantli
ah said hi master after a moment thought that is rather
seriou sinc peopl believ in the judg even when it is wrong
offer them the advertis at trebl rate
it ha been done sir and thei still refus
sir robert walk to the corner of the room where the yellow object
squat on it pedest and contempl it a while as a man often
studi on thing when he is think of anoth it seem to give him
an idea for he look over hi shoulder and said
that will do jeffrei when major vernon come in give him my
compliment and sai that i should be oblig by a word or two with him
the clerk bow and went as noiselessli as he had enter
let see ad sir robert to himself old jackson the editor of
the judg wa a great friend of vernon father the late sir william
vernon gcb i believ that he wa engag to be marri to hi sister
year ago onli she di or someth so the major ought to be abl to
get round him if anybodi can onli the worst of it is i dont altogeth
trust that young gentleman it suit us to give him a share in the
busi becaus he is an engin who know the countri and thi
sahara scheme wa hi notion a veri good on in a wai and for other
reason now he show sign of kick over the trace want to know
too much is develop a conscienc and so forth as though the
promot of specul compani had ani busi with conscienc
ah here he come
sir robert seat himself at hi desk and resum hi calcul upon
a halfsheet of notepap and that moment a clear hearti voic wa
heard speak to the clerk in the outer offic then came the sound of
a strong firm footstep the door open and major alan vernon appear
he wa still quit a young man not more than thirtytwo or three year
of ag though he lack the ultra robust and rubicund appear which
is typic of so mani englishmen of hi class at thi period of life a
heavi bout of blackwat fever acquir on servic in west africa which
would have kill anyon of weaker constitut had rob hi face of
it bloom and left it much sallow if more interest than onc it
had been for in a wai there wa interest about the face also a certain
charm it wa a good and honest face with a rather eager rather puzzl
look that of a man who ha imagin and idea and who search for
the truth but fail to find it as for the charm it lai for the most
part in the pleasant open smile and in the frank but rather round brown
ey overhung by a somewhat massiv forehead which project a littl
or perhap the sever ill alreadi allud to had caus the rest
of the face to sink though thin the man wa bigli built with broad
shoulder and welldevelop limb measur a trifl under six feet in
height
such wa the outward appear of alan vernon as for hi mind it wa
abl enough in certain fashion for instanc those of engin
and the soldierlik faculti to which it had been train frank
and kindli also but in other respect not quick perhap from it
unsuspici alan vernon wa a man slow to discov ill and slower
still to believ in it even when it seem to be discov a weak
that mai have gone far to account for hi presenc in the offic
of those emin and brilliant financi messr aylward
champershaswel just now he look a littl worri like a fish out
of water or rather a fish which ha begun to suspect the qualiti of the
water someth in it smell or tast
jeffrei tell me that you want to see me sir robert he said in hi
low and pleasant voic look at the baronet rather anxious
ye my dear vernon i wish to ask you to do someth if you kindli
will although it is not quit in your line old jackson the editor of
the judg is a friend of your isnt he
he wa a friend of my father and i us to know him slightli
well that near enough as i daresai you have heard he is an
unreason old beggar and ha taken a dislik to our sahara scheme
someon ha set him against it and he refus to receiv advertis
threaten critic etc now the opposit of the judg or ani
other paper wont kill us and if necessari we can fight but at the
same time it is alwai wise to agre with your enemi while he is in the
wai and in shortwould you mind go down and explain hi mistak
to him
befor answer major vernon walk to the window leisur and look
out
i dont like ask favour from famili friend he repli at length
and as you said i think it isnt quit my line though of cours if
it ha anyth to do with the engin possibl i shall be
most happi to see him he ad brighten
i dont know what it ha to do with that is what i shall be oblig if
you will find out answer sir robert with some asper on cant
divid a matter of thi sort into watertight compart it is
true that in so import a concern each of us ha charg of hi
own divis but the fact remain that we ar jointli and sever
respons for the whole i am not sure that you bear thi suffici
in mind my dear vernon he ad with slow emphasi
hi partner move quickli it might almost have been said that he
shiver though whether the movement or the shiver wa produc by
the argument of joint and sever liabil or by the familiar of the
my dear vernon remain uncertain perhap it wa the latter sinc
although the elder man wa a baronet and the younger onli a retir
major of engin the gulf between them as ani on of discern
could see wa wide thei were born live and move in differ
sphere unbridg by ani common element or impuls
i think that i do bear it in mind especi of late sir robert
answer alan vernon slowli
hi partner threw a search glanc on him for he felt that there wa
mean in the word but onli said
that all right my motor is outsid and will take you to fleet street
in no time meanwhil you might tell them to telephon that you ar
come and perhap you will just look in when you get back i havent
got to go to the hous tonight so shall be here till dinner time and
so i think will your cousin haswel muzzl that old bulldog jackson
somehow no doubt he ha hi price like the rest of them in meal or
malt and you neednt stick at the figur we dont want him hang on
our throat for the next week or two
ten minut later the splendid twothousand guinea motor brougham drew
up at the offic of the judg and the obsequi motorfootman bow

chapter ii
the yellow god
alan vernon walk thoughtfulli down the leadcov stair hustl
by eager gentlemen hurri up to see the great editor whose bell
wa alreadi ring furious and wa duli usher by the obsequi
assistantchauffeur back into the luxuri motor there wa an electr
lamp in thi motor and by the light of it hi mind be perplex
he began to read the typewritten document given to him by mr jackson
which he still held in hi hand
as it chanc thei were block for a quarter of an hour near the
mansion hous so that he found time if not to master it at least to
gather enough of it content to make him open hi brown ey veri wide
befor the motor pull up at the granit doorwai of hi offic alan
descend from the machin which depart silent and stood for a
moment wonder what he should do hi impuls wa to jump into a bu
and go straight to hi room or hi club to which sir robert did not
belong but be no coward he dismiss it from hi mind
hi fate hung in the balanc of that he wa well awar either he must
disregard mr jackson warn confirm as it wa by mani secret
fear and instinct of hi own and sai noth except that he had
fail in hi mission or he must take the bull by the horn and break
with the firm to do the latter meant not onli a good deal of moral
courag but practic ruin wherea if he chose the former cours
probabl within a fortnight he would find himself a rich man whatev
jackson and a few other might sai in it depreci he wa certain
that the sahara flotat would go through for it wa underwritten
of cours upon term by respons peopl moreov the unissu
prefer share had alreadi been dealt in at a heavi premium now to
sai noth of the allot to which he wa entitl upon hi hold
in the parent syndic the proport of cash due to him as a partner
would amount to quit a hundr thousand pound in other word he who
had so mani reason for desir monei would be wealthi after work
so hard and undergo so much that he felt to be humili and even
degrad why should he not take hi reward and clear out afterward
thi he rememb he could do sinc probabl by some oversight of
aylward who left such matter to hi lawyer hi deed of partnership
did not bind him to a fix term it could be broken at ani moment
to thi argument there wa onli on possibl answer that of hi
conscienc if onc he were convinc that thing were not right
it would be dishonest to particip in their profit and he wa
convinc mr jackson argument and hi damn document had thrown a
flood of light upon mani matter which he had suspect but never quit
understood he wa the partner of well adventur and the monei
which he receiv would in fact be filch from the pocket of
unsuspect person he would vouch for that of which he wa doubt
and receiv the price of sharp practic in other word he alan vernon
who had never utter a wil untruth or taken a halfpenni that wa not
hi own would befor the tribun of hi own mind stand convict as
a liar and a thief the thing wa not to be born at whatev cost it
must be end if he were fate to be a beggar at least he would be an
honest beggar
with a firm step and a high head he walk straight into sir robert
room without even go through the formal of knock to find
mr champershaswel seat at the eboni desk by hi partner
side examin some document through a readingglass which on hi
appear wa fold over and present thrust awai into a drawer
it seem alan notic to be of an unusu shape and written in some
strang charact
mr haswel a stout joviallook littl man with a florid
complexion and white hair rose at onc to greet him
how do you do alan he said in a cheer voic for as a cousin by
marriag he call him by hi christian name i am just thi minut
back from pari and you will be glad to learn that thei ar go to
support us veri well there in fact i mai sai that the govern ha
taken up the scheme of cours under the rose you know the french have
possess all along that coast and thei wont be sorri to find
an opportun of stretch out their hand a littl further our
difficulti as to capit ar at an end for a full third of it is
guarante in pari and i expect that small investor and specul
for the rise will gobbl a lot more we shall plant 10000000 worth of
sahara scrip in sunni franc my boi and foggi england ha underwritten
the rest it will be a case of letter of allot and regret and
regret alan financi the most success issu of the last dozen
year what do you sai to that and in hi elat the littl man
puf out hi chest and purs up hi lip blew through them make
a sound like that of wind among wire
i dont know mr haswel if we ar all aliv i would prefer to answer
the question twelv month henc or later when we see whether the
compani is go to be a practic success as well or not
again mr haswel made the sound of wind among wire onli thi time
there wa a shriller note in it it mellow wa gone it wa as
though the air had suddenli been fill with frost
a practic success he repeat after him that is scarc our
affair is it promot should not bother themselv with long view
alan these mai be left to the invest public the specul
parson and the maiden ladi who like a flutterthos prop of modern
enterpris but what do you mean you origin thi idea and alwai
said that the profit should be great
ye mr haswel on a moder capit and provid that we ar
sure of the cooper of the port
mr haswel look at him veri searchingli and sir robert who had been
listen said in hi cold voic
i think that we thrash out these point long ago and to tell you the
truth i am rather tire of them especi as it is too late to chang
anyth how did you get on with jackson vernon
i did not get on at all sir robert he will not touch the thing on ani
term and inde mean to oppos it tooth and nail
then he will find himself in a minor when the articl come out
tomorrow of cours it is a bore but we ar strong enough to snap our
finger at him you see thei dont read the judg in franc and no
on ha ever heard of it in constantinopl therefor we have noth to
fearso long as we stick togeth he ad meaningli
alan felt that the crisi had come he must speak now or for ever hold
hi peac inde aylward wa alreadi look round for hi hat
sir robert and mr haswel he broke in rather nervous i have
someth to sai to you someth unpleas and he paus
then pleas sai it at onc vernon i want to dress for dinner i am
go to the theatr tonight and must dine earli repli aylward in a
voic of the utmost unconcern
it is sir robert went on alan with a rush that i do not like the
line upon which thi busi is be work and i wish to give up my
interest in it and retir from the firm as i have a right to do under
our deed of partnership
have you said aylward realli i forget but my dear fellow do not
think that we should wish to keep you for on moment against your will
onli might i ask ha that old puritan jackson hypnot you or is
it a case of sudden mad after influenza
neither answer alan sternli for although he might be diffid on
matter that he did not thoroughli understand he wa not a man to brook
trifl or impertin it is what i have said no more nor less i
am not satisfi either as to the capit or as to the guarante
that the enterpris can be realli carri out furtherand he
pausedfurth i should like what i have never yet been abl to
obtain more inform as to that firman under which the concess is
grant
for on moment a sort of tremor pass over sir robert impass
counten while mr haswel utter hi windi whistl thi time in a
tone of plaintiv remonstr
as you have formal resign your membership of the firm i do not see
that ani us purpos can be serv by discuss such matter
the fullest explan of cours we should have been will to
give
my dear alan broke in mr champershaswel who wa quit upset i
do implor you to reflect for on moment for your own sake in a singl
week you would have been a wealthi man do you realli mean to throw awai
everyth for a whim
perhap vernon rememb that he hold over 1700 of the syndic
share which we have work up to 18 and think it wiser to captur
the profit in sight gener speak a veri sound principl
interrupt aylward sarcast
you ar mistaken sir robert repli alan flush the wai that
those share have been artifici put up is on of the thing to which
i most object i shall onli ask for mine the face valu which i paid for
them
now notwithstand their experi both of the senior partner
did for a moment look rather scare such folli or such honesti wa
absolut incred to them thei felt that there must be much behind
sir robert howev recov instantli

greek to her
at the mention of the name of barbara sir robert aylward look up from

then he also walk into the corner of the room and contempl the
golden mask that seem to float between the froglik shoulder the
shimmer ey drew hi ey though what he saw in them doe not
matter inde he could never rememb onli when he straighten
himself again there wa left on hi mind a determin that not

for a week or so until i make up my mind where to stow her
again mr champershaswel utter hi windi whistl that a man should
refus 17000 for a bit of african gold worth 100 or so struck him
as miracul but sir robert did not seem in the least surpris onli

took it from him again and threw it on the fire sai that of cours
the formal letter of releas would be post and the dissolut
notifi in the gazett then the transfer wa sign and the chequ

hi hard regul face
for myself ye majorfor you on the whole no
what do you mean jeffrei i do not quit understand
i mean major that i am sorri becaus you have never tri to shuffl
off ani shadi busi on to my back and leav me to bear the brunt of
it also becaus you have alwai treat me as a gentleman should not

it is veri kind of you to sai so jeffrei but i cant rememb have
done anyth particular

other rememb and that why i am sorri but for yourself i am glad
sinc although aylward and haswel have put a big thing through and ar
go to make a pot of monei thi is no place for the like of you
and now that you ar go i will make bold to tell you that i alwai
wonder what you were do here by and by major the row will come
as it ha come more than onc in the past befor your time
and then said alan for he wa anxiou to get to the bottom of thi
man mind which hitherto he had alwai found so secret
and then major it wont matter much to messr aylward and
champershaswel who ar us to that kind of thing and will probabl
dissolv partnership and lie quiet for a bit and still less to folk
like myself who ar onli servant but if you were still here it would
have matter a great deal to you for it would blacken your name and
break your heart and then what the good of the monei i tell you
major the clerk went on with quiet intens though i am nobodi and
noth if i could afford it i would follow your exampl but i cant
for i have a sick wife and a famili of delic children who have to
live half the year on the south coast to sai noth of my old mother
andi wa fool enough to be taken in and back sir robert last littl
ventur which cost me all i had save so you see i must make a bit
befor the machin is scrap major but i tell you thi that if i
can get 5000 togeth as i hope to do out of sahara befor i am a
month older for thei had to give me a lookin as i knew too much i am
off to the countri where i wa born to take a farm there no more
of messr aylward and haswel for thoma jeffrei that my bell
goodby major ill take the liberti to write you a line sometim
for i know you wont give me awai goodby and god bless you as i am
sure he will in the long run and stretch out hi hand he took that
of the astonish alan and wrung it warmli
when he wa gone alan went also notic that the clerk whom some
rumour of these event seem to have reach ei him curious
through the glass screen behind which thei sat at their desk as
he thought not without regret and a kind of admir even the
magnific bemedal porter at the door emerg from the carv teak
box where he dwelt and touch hi cap ask if he should call a cab
no thank you sergeant answer alan i will take a bu and
sergeant i think i forgot to give you a present last xma will you
accept thisi wish i could make it more and he present him with
ten shill
the sergeant drew himself up and salut
thank you kindli major he said id rather take that from you than
10 from the other gentlemen but major i wish we were out on the west
coast again togeth it a stink barbar hole but not so bad as
thi er citi
for onc these two had serv as comrad and it wa through alan that
the sergeant obtain hi present lucr but somewhat uncongeni
post
he wa outsid at last the massiv granit portal vanish behind him
in the even mist much as a nightmar vanish he alan vernon who
for a year or more had been in bondag wa a free man again all hi
dream of wealth had depart inde if anyth save in experi
he wa poorer than when first the shadow of yonder doorwai fell upon
him but at least he wa safe safe the deed of partnership which had
been as a chain about hi neck wa now white ash hi name wa eras
from that fear prospectu of sahara limit wherein million which
someon would provid were spoken of like silver in the dai of solomon
as thing of no account the bitterest critic could not sai that he
had made a halfpenni out of the ventur in fact if troubl came hi
voluntari abandon of the profit due to him must go to hi credit
he had plung into the ici water of renunci and come up clean if
nake never sinc he wa a boi could alan rememb feel so utterli
lightheart and free from anxieti not for a million pound would he
have return to gather gold in that mausoleum of reput as for
the futur he did not in the least care what happen there wa no
on depend on him and in thi wai or in that he could alwai earn a
crust a nice honest crust
he ran down the street and danc for joi like a child ye and
present a crossingsweep against whom he but with a whole
sixpenc in compens thu he reach the mansion hous not
unsuspect of inebrieti by the polic and clamber to the top of a
bu crowd with weari and anxiouslook citi clerk return home
after a long dai labour at starvat wage in that cold compani and
a chill atmospher some of hi enthusiasm evapor he rememb
that thi step of hi meant that sooner or later within a year or two
at most yarlei where hi famili had dwelt for centuri must go to
the hammer why had he not accept aylward offer and sold that old
fetish to him for 17000 there wa no question of shared there
and if a veri wealthi man chose to give a fanci price for a curios
he could take it without doubt or shame at least it would have suffic
to save yarlei which after all wa onli mortgag for 20000 for the
life of him he could not tell he had act on impuls a veri curiou
impuls and there wa an end of it perhap it might be becaus hi
uncl had told him as a boi that the thing wa uniqu or perhap
becaus old jeeki hi negro servant vener it so much and swore
that it wa lucki at ani rate he had declin and there wa an end
but anoth and a graver matter remain he had desir wealth to save
yarlei but he desir it still more for a differ purpos abov
everyth on earth he love barbara hi distant cousin and the niec
of mr champershaswel who until an hour ago had been hi partner
now she wa a great heiress and without fortun he could not marri her
even if she would marri him which remain in doubt for on thing
her uncl and guardian haswel under her father will had absolut
discret in thi matter until she reach the ag of twentyf and
for anoth he wa too proud therefor it would seem that in abandon
hi busi he had abandon hi chanc of barbara also which wa a
truli dread thought
well it wa in order that he might see her that he had agre to visit
the court on the morrow even though it meant a meet with hi late
partner who were the last peopl with whom he desir to foregath
again so soon then and there he made up hi mind that befor he bade
barbara farewel he would tell her the whole stori so that she might
not misjudg him after that he would go off somewhereto africa
perhap meanwhil he wa quit tire out as tire as though he had
lain a week in the grip of fever he must eat some food and get to
bed suffici unto the dai wa the evil thereof yet on the whole he
bless the name of jackson editor of the judg and hi father old
friend
when alan had left the offic sir robert turn to mr champershaswel
and ask him abruptli what the devil doe thi mean
mr haswel look up at the ceil and whistl in hi own peculiar
fashion then answer
i cannot sai for certain but our young friend strang conduct seem
to suggest that he ha smelt a rat possibl even that jackson the old
beast ha shown him a ratof a larg turkish breed
sir robert nod
vernon is a fellow who doesnt like rat thei seem to haunt hi
sleep he said but do you think that have seen it he will keep it
in the bag
oh certainli certainli answer mr haswel with cheer
the man is the soul of honour he will never give us awai look how he
behav about those share still i think that perhap we ar well rid
of him too much honour like too much zeal is a veri danger qualiti
in ani busi
i dont know that i agre with you answer sir robert i am not
sure that in the long run we should not do better for a littl more of
the articl for my part although it will not hurt us publicli for the
thing will never be notic i am sorri that we have lost vernon veri
sorri inde i dont think him a fool and awkward as thei mai be i
respect hi qualiti
so do i so do i answer mr haswel and of cours we have act
against hi advic throughout which must have been annoi to him
the scheme as he suggest it wa a fair busi proposit that might
have paid ten per cent on a small capit but what is the good of ten
per cent to you and me we want million and we ar go to get them
well he is come to the court tomorrow and perhap after all we
shall be abl to arrang matter ill give barbara a hint she ha
great influenc with him and you might do the same aylward
miss champer ha great influenc with everyon who is fortun enough
to know her answer sir robert courteous but even if she choos
to us it i doubt if it will avail in thi case vernon ha been make
up hi mind for a long while i have watch him and am sure of that
tonight he determin to take the plung and i do not think that we
shall see ani more of him in thi offic haswel he ad with sudden
energi i tell you that of late our luck ha been too good to last the

wheel of human fortun went round just as it doe todai there let

laugh electr is strength and i hate to see strength burn to

so do i he answer with enthusiasm
then a french gentleman on hi left have discov that he wa the
engin who had formul the great flood scheme began to address
him as cher maitr speak so rapidli hi own languag that alan
whose french wa none of the best struggl after him in vain whilst
he wa try to answer a question which he did not understand the door
at the end of the hall open and through it appear barbara champer

small who inde wa onli of middl height yet even at that distanc
it wa imposs to mistak the digniti of her appear a slim woman

barbara came straight onward look neither to the right or to the

alan and barbara
there wa no bridg or billiard at the court that night where
ordinarili the plai ran high enough after mr haswel had been carri
to hi room some of the guest among them sir robert aylward went to
bed remark that thei could do no good by sit up while other
more concern wait to hear the verdict of the doctor who must drive
from six mile awai he came and half an hour later barbara enter
the billiard room and told alan who wa sit there smoke that her
uncl had recov from hi faint and that the doctor who wa to stai
all night said that he wa in no danger onli suffer from a heart
attack brought on appar by overwork or excit
when alan woke next morn the first thing that he heard through hi
open window wa the sound of the doctor depart dogcart then jeeki
appear and told him that mr haswel wa all right again but that
all night he had shaken like on jelli alan ask what had been the
matter with him but jeeki onli shrug hi shoulder and said that he
did not knowperhap yellow god touch him up
at breakfast as in her note she had said she would barbara appear
wear a short skirt sir robert who wa there also look extrem
pale even for him and with black rim round hi ey ask her if she
were go to golf to which she answer that she would think it over
it wa a somewhat melancholi meal and as though by common consent no
mention wa made of jeeki tale of the yellow god and beyond the
usual polit inquiri veri littl of their host seizur
as barbara went out she whisper to alan who open the door for her
meet me at halfpast ten in the kitchen garden
accordingli have chang hi cloth surreptiti alan avoid
the other made hi wai by a circuit rout to thi kitchen garden
which after the fashion of modern place wa hidden behind a belt of
tree nearli a quarter of a mile from the hous here he wander about
till present he heard barbara pleasant voic behind him sai
dont dawdl so we shall be late for church
so thei start somewhat furtiv like runawai children as thei went
alan ask how her uncl wa
all right now she answer but he ha had a bad shake it wa
that yellow god stori which did it i know for i wa there when he
wa come to with sir robert he kept talk about it in a confus
manner sai that it wa swim to him across the floor till at
last sir robert bent over him and told him to be quiet quit sternli
do you know alan i believ that your pet fetish ha been manifest
itself in some unpleas fashion up there in the offic
inde if so it must be sinc i left for i never heard of anyth
of the sort nor ar aylward and your uncl like peopl to see ghost
in fact sir robert wish to give me about 17000 for the thing onli
the dai befor yesterdai which doesnt look as though it had been
frighten him
well he wont repeat the offer alan for i heard him promis my uncl
onli thi morn that it should be sent back to yarlei at onc but
why did he want to bui it for such a lot of monei tell me quickli
alan i am dy to hear the whole stori
so he began and told her omit noth while she listen eagerli
to everi word hardli interrupt him at all as he finish hi tale
thei reach the door of the quaint old villag church just as the clock
wa strike eleven
come in alan she said gentli and thank heaven for all it merci
for you should be a grate man todai
then without give him time to answer she enter the church and thei
took their place in the great squar pew that for gener had been
occupi by the owner of the ancient hous which mr haswel pull
down when he built the court there were their monument upon the
wall and their graveston in the chancel floor but now no on except
barbara ever sat in their pew even the bench set asid for the
servant were empti for those who frequent the court were not
churchgoer and like master like man inde the gentlefac old
clergyman look quit pleas and surpris when he saw two inhabit
of that palati resid amongst hi congreg although it is true
that barbara wa hi friend and helper
the simpl servic went on the first lesson wa read it cri woe upon
them that join hous to hous and field to field that draw iniqu
with cord of vaniti and sin as it were with a cart rope that call evil
good and good evil that put dark for light and light for dark
that justifi the wick for reward that feast full but regard not the
work of the lord neither consid the oper of hi hand for of
such it prophesi that their hous great and fair should be without
inhabit and desol
it wa veri well read and alan listen thought that the
denunci of the old seer of thousand of year ago were not
inappropri to the dweller in some hous great and fair of hi own
dai who whatev thei did or left undon regard not the work of
the lord neither consid the oper of hi hand perhap barbara
thought so too at ani rate a rather sad littl smile appear onc or
twice upon her sweet firm face as the immort poem echo down the
aisl
the peac that passeth understand wa invok upon their head and
rise with the rest of the scanti congreg thei went awai
shall we walk home by the wood alan ask barbara it is three
mile round but we dont lunch till two
he nod and present thei were alon in those wood the beauti
wood through which the breath of spring wa breath tread upon
carpet of bluebel violet and primros quit alon unaccompani
save by the wild thing that stole across their path undisturb save
by the sound of the sing bird and of the wind among the tree
what did you mean barbara when you said that i should be a grate
man todai ask alan present
barbara look him in the ey in that open virgin fashion of her
and answer in the word of the lesson woe unto them that draw
iniqu with the cord of vaniti and sin as it were with a cartrop
that lai hous to hous and through an open in the wood she
point to the roof of the court stand on on hill and to the roof
of old hall stand upon anotherand field to field and with a
sweep of her hand she indic all the countri round for mani hous
great and fair that have music in their feast shall be left desol
then turn she said
do you understand now alan
i think so he answer you mean that i have been in bad compani
veri bad alan on of them is my own uncl but the truth remain the
truth alan thei ar no better than thiev all thi wealth is stolen
and i thank god that you have found it out in time befor you becam on
of them in heart as well as in name
if you refer to the sahara syndic he said the idea is sound
enough inde i am respons for it the thing can be done great
benefit would result too long to go into
ye ye alan but you know that thei never mean to do it thei onli
mean to get the million from the public i have live with my uncl for
ten year ever sinc my poor father di and i know the backstair
of the busi there have been half a dozen scheme like thi and
although thei have had their bad time veri bad time he and sir
robert have grown richer and richer but what ha happen to those who
have invest in them oh let us drop the subject it is unpleas
for myself it doesnt matter becaus although it isnt under my
control i have monei of my own you know we ar a plebeian lot on the
male side my grandfath wa a draper in a larg wai of busi my
father wa a coalmerch who made a great fortun hi brother my
uncl in whom my father alwai believ implicitli took to what is
call financ and when my father di he left me hi onli child
in hi guardianship until i am five and twenti i cannot even marri or
touch a halfpenni without hi consent in fact if i should marri against
hi will the most of my monei goe to him
i expect that he ha got it alreadi said alan
no i think not i found out that although it is not mine it is not
hi he cant draw it without my signatur and i steadili refus to
sign anyth again and again thei have brought me document and i
have alwai said that i would consid them at five and twenti when
i came of ag under my father will i went on the sly to a lawyer
in kingswel and paid him a guinea for hi advic and he put me up to
that sign noth he said and i have sign noth so except by
forgeri noth can have gone still for all that it mai have gone
for anyth i know i am not worth more than the cloth i stand in
although my father wa a veri rich man
if so we ar about in the same boat barbara alan answer with a
laugh for my present possess ar yarlei which bring in about
100 a year less than the interest on it mortgag and cost of upkeep
and the 1700 that aylward paid me back on fridai for my share if i
had stuck to them i understand that in a week or two i should have been
worth 100000 and now you see here i am over thirti year of ag
without a profess invalid out of the armi and have fail in
financ a mere bit of driftwood without hope and without a trade
barbara brown ey grew soft with sympathi or wa it tear
you ar a curiou creatur alan she said why didnt you take the
17000 for that fetish of your it would have been a fair deal and
have set you on your leg
i dont know he answer dejectedli it went against the grain so
what is the us of talk about it i think my old uncl austin told
me it wasnt to be part withno perhap it wa jeeki bother the
yellow god it is alwai crop up
ye repli barbara the yellow god is alwai crop up
especi in thi neighbourhood
thei walk on a while in silenc till suddenli barbara sat down upon a
bole of fell oak and began to cry
what is the matter with you ask alan
i dont know she answer everyth goe wrong i live in a kind
of gild hell i dont like my uncl and i loath the men he bring
about the place i have no friend i scarc know a woman intim
i have troubl i cant tell you andi am wretch you ar the onli
creatur i have left to talk to and i suppos that after thi row you
must go awai too to make your live
alan look at her there weep on the log and hi heart swell within
him for he had love thi girl for year
barbara he gasp pleas dont cry it upset me you know you ar
a great heiress
that remain to be prove she answer but anywai what ha it to
do with the case
it ha everyth to do with it at least so far as i am concern if
it hadnt been for that i should have ask you to marri me a long
while ago becaus i love you as i would now but of cours it is
imposs
barbara ceas her weep wipe her ey with the back of her hand
and look up at him
alan she said i think that you ar the biggest fool i ever
knewnot but that a fool is rather refresh when on live among
knave
i know i am a fool he answer if i wasnt i should not have
mention my misfortun to you but sometim thing ar too much for
on forget it and forgiv me
oh ye she said i forgiv you a woman can gener forgiv a
man for be fond of her whatev she mai be she is readi to take
a lenient view of hi human weak but as to forget that is
a differ matter i dont exactli see why i should be so anxiou to
forget who havent mani peopl to care about me and she look at him
in quit a new fashion on inde which gave him someth of a shock
for he had not thought the nymphlik barbara capabl of such a look as
that she and ani sort of passion had alwai seem so far apart
now after all alan wa veri much a man if a modest on with all a
man instinct and therefor there ar appear of the femal face
which even such as he could not entir misinterpret
youdontmean he said doubtfulli you dont realli mean and
he stood hesit befor her
if you would put your question a littl more clearli alan i might be
abl to give you an answer she repli that quaint littl smile of
her creep to the corner of her mouth like sunshin through a mist
of rain
you dont realli mean he went on that you care anyth about me
like like i have care for you for year
oh alan she said laugh outright why in the name of good
shouldnt i care about you i didnt sai that i do mind but why
shouldnt i what is the gulf between us
the old on he answer that between dive and lazarusthat
between the rich and the poor
alan said barbara look down i dont know what ha come over me
but for some unexplain and inexplic reason i am inclin to
give lazaru a leadacross that gulf the first on i mean not the
second
like the glanc which preced it thi wa a sai that even alan
could not misunderstand he sat himself on the log besid her while
she still look down watch him out of the corner of her ey
he went red he went white hi heart beat veri violent then he
stretch out hi big brown hand and took her small white on and as
thi familiar produc no remonstr let it fall and pass hi
arm about her drew her to him and embrac her not onc but
often with such vigour that a squirrel which had been watch these
proceed from a neighbour tree bolt round it scandal and
wa seen no more
i love you i love you he said huskili
so i gather she answer in a feebl voic
do you care for me he ask
it would seem that i must alan otherwis i should scarcelyoh you
foolish alan and heedless of her sundai hat which never recov
from thi encount but wa kept as a holi relic she let her head fall
upon hi shoulder and began to cry again thi time for veri happi
he kiss her tear awai then as he could think of noth els to sai
ask her if she would marri him
it is the gener sequel to thi kind of thing i believ she
answer or at ani rate it ought to be but if you want a direct
answery i will if my uncl will let me which he wont as you
have quarrel with him or at ani rate two year henc when i am five
and twenti and my own mistress that is if we have anyth to marri
on for on must eat at present our worldli possess seem to consist
chiefli of a larg store of mutual affect a good stock of cloth
and on yellow god which after what happen last night i do not think
you will get anoth chanc of turn into cash
i must make monei somehow he said
ye alan but i am afraid it is not easi to dohonestli nobodi
want peopl without capit whose onli stock in trade is a brief but
distinguish militari career and a larg experi of african fever
alan groan at thi veraci but discourag remark and she went on
quickli
i mean to spend anoth guinea upon my friend the lawyer at kingswel
perhap he can rais the wind by a postobit or someth she ad
vagu i mean a postuncleobit
if he doe barbara i cant live on your monei alon it isnt right
oh dont you troubl about that alan if onc i can get hold of those
dim thousand you will soon be abl to make more for unto him that hath
shall be given but at present thei ar veri dim and for all i know mai
be repres by stock in deceas compani in short the financi
posit is extraordinarili depress as thei sai in the market
intellig in the time but that no reason why we should be
depress also
no barbara for at ani rate we have got each other
ye she answer spring up we have got each other dear until
death do us part and somehow i dont think hell do that yet awhil
it come into my heart that he wont do that alan that you and i ar

system and found them to be rubbish i am convinc that we ar but
highlydevelop mammal born by chanc and when our dai is done
depart into the black nothing out of which we came everyth
els that is what is call the higher and spiritu part i attribut
to the superstit incid to the terror of the hideou posit in
which we find ourselv that of god of a sort hem in by a few year
of fear and torment life but you know the old argument so why
should i enter on them and now i am confront with an experi
which i cannot explain i certainli thought that in the offic on fridai
even i saw that gold mask to which i had taken so strang a fanci
that i offer to give vernon 17000 for it becaus i thought that it

mr haswel whistl again but on a new note
prai do stop that nois said sir robert it get upon my nerv
which ar shaki thi morn listen it is a curiou thing on less
to be understood even than the coincid of the yellow god but at
my present ag of fortyfour for the first time in my life i have
commit the folli of what is call fall in love it is not the
case of a success middleag man wish to ranger himself and
settl down with a desir parti but of sheer stark infatu
i ador barbara the wors she treat me the more i ador her i had
rather that the sahara flotat should fail than that she should refus
me i would rather lose threequart of my fortun than lose her do
you understand
hi partner look at him purs up hi lip to whistl then
rememb and shook hi head instead
no he answer barbara is a nice girl but i should not have
imagin her capabl of inspir such sentiment in a man almost old
enough to be her father i think that you ar the victim of a kind of
mania which i have heard of but never experienc venusor is it
cupidha net you my dear aylward
oh prai leav god and goddess out of it we have had enough of them
alreadi he answer exasper that is my case at ani rate and
what i want to know now is if i have your support in my suit rememb

which i will settl halfit is a good thing to do in our businessand
a baronetci that will be a peerag befor long

i think so there will be a gener elect within the next three
month and on such occas a coupl of hundr thousand in cool cash
come in us to a parti that is short of readi monei i think i mai
sai that it is settl she will be the ladi aylward or ani other name
she mai fanci and on of the richest women in england now have i your
support
ye my dear friend why not though barbara doe not want monei for
she ha plenti of her own in firstclass secur that i could never
persuad her to vari for she is shrewd in that wai and steadili refus

here a sickli look of alarm spread itself over hi face i dont know
how long i have to live that infern doctor examin my heart thi
morn and told me that it wa weak weak wa hi word but from the
tone in which he said it i believ that he meant more aylward i
gather that i mai die ani dai
nonsens haswel so mai we all he repli with an affect of
cheer which fail to carri convict
present mr haswel who had hidden hi face in hi hand look up
with a sigh and said
oh ye of cours you have my support for after all she is my onli
relat and i should be glad to see her safe marri also as it
happen she cant marri anyon without my consent at ani rate until
she is five and twenti for if she doe under her father will all her
properti goe awai most of it to chariti except a beggarli 200 a
year you see my brother john had a great horror of imprud marriag
and a still greater belief in me which as it chanc is a good thing
for you
had he said sir robert and prai why is it a good thing for me
becaus my dear aylward unless my observ is at fault there is
anoth richard in the field our late partner vernon of whom by
the wai barbara is extrem fond though it mai onli be in a friendli
fashion at ani rate she pai more attent to hi wish and opinion
than to mine and your put togeth
at the mention of alan name aylward start violent
i fear it he said and he is more than ten year my junior and
a soldier not a man of busi also there is no us disguis the
truth although i am a baronet and shall be a peer and he is noth
but a beggarli countri gentleman with a dso tack on to hi name
he belong to a differ class to us as she doe too on her mother
side well i can smash him up for you rememb i took over that
mortgag on yarlei and ill do it if necessari practic our friend
ha not a shill that he can call hi own therefor haswel unless
you plai me fals which i dont think you will for i can be a nasti
enemi he ad with a threat in hi voic alan vernon hasnt much
chanc in that direct
i dont know aylward i dont know repli haswel shake hi
white head barbara is a strongwil woman and she might choos to
take the man and let the monei go and thenwho can stop her also i
dont like your idea of smash vernon it isnt right and it mai come
back on our own head especi your i am sorri that he ha left us
as you were on fridai night for somehow he wa a good honest stick to
lean on and we want such a stick but i am tire now i realli cant
talk ani more the doctor warn me against excit get the girl
consent aylward and well see ah here come my soup goodby for
the present
when sir robert came down to luncheon he found barbara look
particularli radiant and charm alreadi presid at that meal and
convers in her best french to the foreign gentlemen who were pai
her compliment

talk to your uncl and afterward skim through the articl in
yesterdai paper on our littl ventur which come out tomorrow a
cheer occup on the whole for with on or two except thei

thei did cost that is not strang your english paper thei ar so
expens in pari we have done it for half the monei
barbara and some of the guest laugh outright find thi frank
charm
but where have you been miss champer i thought that we were go to
have a round of golf togeth the caddi were there i wa there the
green had been special roll thi morn but there wa no you
no she answer becaus major vernon and i walk to church and
heard a veri good sermon upon the observ of the sabbath
you ar sever he said do you think it wrong for men who work hard
all the week to plai a harmless game on sundai
not at all sir robert then she look at him and come to a sudden
decis ad if you like i will plai you nine hole thi afternoon
and give you a stroke a hole or would you prefer a foursom
no let us fight alon and let the best player win
veri well sir robert but you mustnt forget that i am handicap
dont look angri she whisper to alan as thei stroll out into the
garden after lunch i must clear thing up and know what we have to
face ill be back by teatim and we will have it out with my uncl
the nine hole had been plai and by a singl stroke barbara had won
the match which pleas her veri much for she had done her best and
with such heavi odd in hi favour sir robert who had also done hi
best wa no mean oppon even for a player of her skill inde the
fight had been quit earnest for each parti knew that it wa but a
prelud to anoth and more seriou fight and look upon the result as
in some sens an omen
i am conquer he said in a voic in which vexat struggl with a
laugh and by a woman over whom i had an advantag it is humili
for i confess i do not like be beaten
dont you think that women gener win if thei mean to ask
barbara i believ that when thei fail which is often enough it
is becaus thei dont care or cant make up their mind a woman in
earnest is a danger antagonist
ye he answer or the best of alli then he gave the club and
halfacrown to the caddi and when thei were out of hear ad
miss champer i have been wonder for some time whether it is
possibl that you would becom such an alli to me
i know noth of busi sir robert my tast do not lie that wai
you know well that i wa not speak of busi miss champer i wa
speak of anoth kind of partnership that which natur ha ordain
between men and womenmarriag will you accept me as a husband
she open her lip to speak but he lift hi hand and went on
listen befor you give that readi answer which it is so hard to recal
or smooth awai i know all my disadvantag my year which to you mai
seem mani my modest origin my trade which not altogeth without
reason you despis and dislik well the first two cannot be chang
except for the wors the second can be and alreadi is buri beneath
the gold and ermin of wealth and titl what doe it matter if i am
the son of a citi clerk who never earn more than 2 a week and wa
born in a tenement at battersea when i am on of the rich men of thi
rich land and shall die a peer in a palac leav million and honour
to my children as for the third my occup i am prepar to give
it up it ha serv my turn and after next week i shall have earn
the amount that year ago i determin to earn thenceforth set abov
the accid of fortun i propos to devot myself to higher aim
those of legitim ambit so far as my time would allow i have
alreadi taken some share in polit as a worker i intend to continu
in them as a ruler which i still have the health and abil to do i
mean to be on of the first men in thi empir to ride to power over
the head of all the nonent whose onli claim upon the confid of
their countrymen is that thei were born in a certain class with monei
in their pocket and without the need to spend the best of their manhood
in work with you at my side i can do all these thing and more and
such is the futur that i have to offer you
again she would have broken in upon hi speech and again he stop her
read the unspoken answer on her lip
listen i have not told you all perhap i have put first what should
have come last i have not told you that i love you earnestli and
sincer with the settl unalter love that sometim come to
men in middleag who have never turn their thought that wai befor
i will not attempt the rhapsodi of passion which at my time of life
might sound foolish or out of place yet it is true that i am fill
with thi passion which ha descend on me and taken possess of me
i who often have laugh at such thing in other men ador you you
ar a joi to my ey if you ar not in the room for me it is empti i
admir the upright of your charact and even your prejudic and
to your standard i desir to approxim my own i think that no man can
ever love you quit so well as i do barbara champer now speak i am
readi to meet the best or the worst
after her fashion barbara look him straight in the face with her
steadi ey and answer gentli enough for the man method of
present hi case elabor and prepar though it evid wa had
touch her
i fear it is the worst sir robert there ar hundr of women
superior to myself in everi wai who would be glad to give you the help
and companionship you ask with their heart thrown in choos on of
them for i cannot do so
he heard and for the first time hi face broke as it were all thi
while it had remain masklik and immov even when he spoke of hi
love but now it broke as ic break at the pressur of a sudden flood
beneath and she saw the depth and eddi of hi natur and understood
their strength not that he reveal them in speech angri or plead
for that remain calm and measur enough she did not hear she saw
and even then it wa marvel to her that a mere chang in a man
express could explain so much
those ar veri cruel word he said ar thei unalter
quit i do not plai in such matter it would be wick
mai i ask you on question for if the answer is in the neg i
shall still continu to hope do you care for ani other man

in thi world and that which live abov you you sai you will do thi
and that you should studi a book which few of you ever read where it
tell you that you do not know what you will be on the morrow that your
life is even as a vapour appear for a littl time and then vanish

to be in my hand but it would not in the least surpris me if she
won the rubber for the element that i call chanc and she would call

while think of barbara and all the event of that tumultu
dai notwithstand hi rebuff at the hand of mr haswel and the
difficulti and danger which threaten he felt even then that it had

love him with all her heart and soul as he love barbara and as thi
wa so he did not care alittl bonsa about anyth els the futur
must look to itself suffici to the dai wa the abid joi thereof
so he went to bed and for a while to sleep but he did not sleep veri
long for present he fell to dream someth about big bonsa and
littl bonsa which sat or rather float on either side of hi couch
and held an intermin convers over him while jeeki and sir
robert aylward perch respect at it head and it foot like the
symbol of the good and evil genii on a mahommedan tomb act as a kind
of insan choru he struck hi repeat it wa onli on oclock so he
tri to go to sleep again but fail utterli never had he been more
painfulli awak
for an hour or more alan persev then at last in despair he jump
out of bed wonder what he could do to occupi hi mind suddenli he
rememb the diari of hi uncl the rev mr austin which he had
inherit with the yellow god and a few other possess but never
examin thei had been put awai in a box in the librari about fifteen
year befor just at the time he enter the armi and there doubtless
thei remain well as he could not sleep why should he not examin
them now and thu get through some of thi weari night
he lit a candl and went down to the librari an ancient and beauti
apart with black oak panel between the bookcas set there in
the time of elizabeth in thi panel there were cupboard and in
on of the cupboard wa the box he sought made of teak wood on it
lid wa paint the reverend henri austin passeng to acra show
that it had onc been hi uncl cabin box the kei hung from the
handl and have lit more candl alan drew it out and unlock it
to be greet by a smell of musti document done up in great bundl
on by on he place them on the floor it wa a dreari occup alon
there in that great silent room at the dead of night on inde with
which he wa soon satisfi for somehow it remind him of rifl
coffin in a vault befor him so carefulli put awai lai the record of
a good if not a distinguish life and until thi moment he had never
found the energi even to look through them
at length he came to the end of the bundl and saw that beneath lai
a number of manuscript book pack close with their back upward
markedjournaland with the year and sometim the place of the
author resid as he glanc at them in dismai for thei were mani
hi ey caught the titl of on inscribeda were sever otherswest
africa and written in bracket beneaththi vol contain all
that is left of the note of my escap with jeeki from the asiki
devilworshipp
alan drew it out and have refil and close the box bore it off to
hi room where he proceed to read it in bed as a matter of fact he
found that there wa not veri much to read for the reason that most
of the closelywritten volum had been so damag by water that the
pencil write had run and becom utterli illeg the centr
page howev not have been soak could still be deciph at
ani rate in part also there wa a larg manuscript map execut in
ink appar at a later date on the back of which wa written i
purpos dv to rewrit at some conveni time all the histori of my
visit to the unknown asiki peopl as my origin note were practic
destroi when the cano overset in the rapid and most of our few
possess were lost except thi book and the gold fetish mask which
is call littl bonsa or small swim head thi i think i can
do with the aid of jeeki from memori but as the matter ha onli a
person and no religi interest see that i wa not abl even to
preach the word among those benight and bloodthirsti savag in
whose countri as i verili believ the devil ha on of hi princip
habit it must stand over till a conveni season such as the
time of old ag or sick ha
ps i ought to add with gratitud that even out of thi hell fire i
wa enabl to snatch on brand from the burn name the negro
lad jeeki to whose extraordinari resourc and faith i ow
my escap after a long hesit i have been abl to baptiz him
although i fear that the taint of heathen still cling to him thu
not six month ago i caught him sacrif a white cock to the imag
littl bonsa in gratitud as to my horror he explain for my have
been appoint an honorari canon of the cathedr i have told him to
take that ugli mask which ha been so often soak in human blood and
melt it down over the kitchen stove after pick out the gem in the
ey that the proce mai be given to the poor note i had better
see to thi myself as where littl bonsa is concern jeeki is not to
be trust he sai with some excus that it ha magic and that if
he melt it down he will melt down too and so shall i how dark and
ridicul ar the superstit of the heathen perhap howev
instead of destroi the thing which is certainli uniqu i might sell
it to a museum and thu spare the feel of that weak vessel jeeki
who otherwis would veri like take it into hi head to wast awai and
die as these african do when their nerv ar affect by terror of
their fetish
chapter vii
the diari
reflect that time evid had made littl chang in jeeki alan
studi thi rout map with care and found that it start from old
calabar in the bight of biafra on the west coast of africa whenc it
ran up to the great qua river which it follow for a long wai then it
struck across countri mark dens forest northward and came to a
river call katsena along the bank of which the rout went eastward
thenc it turn northward again through swamp and end in mountain
call shaku in the middl of these mountain wa written asiki peopl
live here on raaba river
the map wa roughli drawn to scale and alan who wa an engin
accustom to such thing easili calcul that the distanc of thi
raaba river from old calabar wa about 350 mile as the crow fli
though probabl the actual rout to be travel wa nearer five hundr
mile
have master the map he open the watersoak diari turn page
after page onli here and there could he make out a sentenc such as
so i defi that beauti but terrif woman i a christian minist
the husband of a heathen priestess perish the thought sooner would i
be sacrif to bonsa
then came more illeg page and again a paragraph that could be
readthei gave me the bean in a gold cup and know it deadli
natur i prepar myself for death but happili for me my stomach
alwai delic reject it at onc though i felt queer for dai
afterward whereon thei clap their hand and said i wa evid
innoc and a great medicin man
and again further onnev did i see so much gold whether in dust
nugget or work articl i imagin it must be worth million but
at that time gold wa the last thing with which i wish to troubl
myself
after thi entri mani page were utterli effac
the last legibl passag ran as followsso guid by the lad jeeki
and wear the gold mask littl bonsa on my head i ran through
them all hold him by the hand as though i were drag him awai
a strang spectacl i must have been with my old black clergyman coat
button about me my nake leg and the gold mask as pretend to be
a devil such as thei worship i rush through them in the moonlight
blow the whistl in the mask and bellow like a bull such
wa the begin of my dread six month journei to the coast
set asid the merci of provid that preserv me for it own
purpos i could never have live to reach it had it not been for
littl bonsa sinc curious enough i found thi fetish known and
dread for hundr of mile and that by peopl who had never seen it
ye even by the wild cannib whenev it wa produc food bearer
cano or whatev els i might want were forthcom as though by
magic great is the fame of big and littl bonsa in all that part of
west africa although strang as it mai seem the outli tribe
seldom mention them by name if thei must speak of either of these
imag which ar suppos to be man and wife thei call it the
yellowgodwholivesyond
not anoth word of all thi strang histori could alan deciph so
with ach ey he shut up the stain and tatter volum and at
last just as the dai wa break fell asleep
at eleven oclock on that same morn for he had slept late alan rose
from hi breakfast and went to smoke hi pipe at the open door of the
beauti old hall in yarlei that wa clad with brown elizabethan
oak for which ani dealer would have given hundr of pound it wa a
charm morn on of those that come to us sometim in an english
april when the air is soft like that of itali and the smell of the earth
rise like that of incens and littl cloud float idli across a sky
of tender blue stand thu he look out upon the park where the elm
alreadi show a ting of green and the ashbud were coal black onli
the walnut and the great oak some of them pollard of a thousand
year of ag remain stark and stern in their winter dress
alan wa in a reflect mood and involuntarili began to wonder how mani
of hi forefath had stood in that same spot upon such april morn
and look out upon those ident tree waken in the breath of
spring onli the tree and the landscap knew those tree which had
seen everi on of them born to baptism to bridal and to burial the
men and women themselv were forgotten their portrait each in the
garb of hi or her gener hung here and there upon the wall of the
ancient hous which onc thei had own or inhabit but who rememb
anyth of them todai in mani case their name even were lost for
believ that thei so import in their time could never sink into
oblivion thei had not thought it necessari to record them upon their
pictur
and now the thing wa come to an end unless in thi wai or in that
he could save it what remain of the old place for the outli land
had long sinc been sold must go to the hammer and becom the properti
of some push and success person who desir to found a famili and
perhap in dai to be would claim these veri pictur that hung upon the
wall as those of hi own ancestor declar that he had brought in
the estat becaus he wa a rel of the ancient and ruin race
well it wa the wai of the world and perhap it must be so but the
thought of it made alan vernon sad if he could have continu that
busi it might have been otherwis by thi hour hi late partner
sir robert aylward and mr champershaswel were doubtless sit in
their granit offic in the citi probabl in consult with lord
specton who had taken hi place upon the board of the great compani
which wa be subscrib that dai no doubt applic for share
were pour in by the earli post and by telegram and from time to
time mr jeffrei respectfulli report their number and amount while
sir robert look unconcern and mr haswel rub hi hand and
whistl cheerfulli almost he could envi them these men who were
realiz great fortun amidst the bustl and excit of that fierc
financi life whilst he stood penniless and stare at the tree and
the ew which wander among them with their lamb he who after all
hi work wa but a failur with a sigh he turn awai to fetch hi
cap and go out walkingther wa a tenant whom he must see a shifti
newfangl kind of man who wa alwai clamour for fresh build

africa fall on the wide river with a hiss splash sullen and
continu now toward morn the rain had ceas and everywher
rose a soft and pearli mist that clung to the face of the water and
seem to entangl itself like strand of wool among the branch of
the border tree on the bank of the river at a spot that had been
clear of bush stood a tent and out of thi tent emerg a white man
wear a sun helmet and grei flannel shirt and trouser it wa alan

thump and mutter curs
a minut or two later jeeki himself appear and he also wa much

he wore a white robe and sandal that gave him an air at onc dignifi
and patriarch
goodmorn major he said cheerfulli i hope you sleep well
major in thi lowli and accurs situat which is more than we

corner of hi ey at hi master face for he knew that the spot where
thei had slept wa deadli to white men at thi season of the year you

morn we begin walk through forest where it rather dark and cool
and comfort that is if we no see dwarf peopl from whom good lord
deliv us and he bow toward the box contain littl bonsa
will those four porter come with us through the forest jeeki as
thei promis
ye ye thei come last night thei sai thei not come too much afraid
of dwarf but i settl their hash i tell them i save up bit of their
hair and toe nail when thei no think and i mix it with medicin
and if thei not come thei die everi on befor thei get home thei
think me great doctor and thei believ perhap thei die if thei go on
if so i tell them that becaus thei want show white feather and thei
think me greater doctor still oh thei come thei come no fear or
els jeeki know reason why now here coffe major drink him hot
befor you go take tub but keep in shallow water becaus crocodil he
veri earli riser
alan laugh and depart to take tub notwithstand the mosquito
that buzz round him in cloud the water wa cool and pleasant by
comparison with the hot sticki air and the feel of it seem to rid
him of the languor result from hi disturb night
a month had pass sinc he had left old calabar and ow to the
incess rain the journei had been hard inde the white men there
thought that he wa mad to attempt to go up the river at thi season
of cours he had said noth to them of the object of hi expedit
hint onli that he wish to explor and shoot and perhap prospect
for mine but know as thei did that he wa an engin offic with
a good record and much african experi thei soon made up their mind
that he had been sent by govern upon some secret mission that for
reason of hi own he prefer to keep to himself thi conclus
which jeeki zealous foster behind hi back in fact did alan a good
turn sinc ow to it he obtain boatmen and servant at a season
when had he been suppos to be but a privat person these would
scarc have been forthcom at ani price hitherto hi journei had
been on long record of mud mosquito and miseri but otherwis
devoid of incid except the eat of on of hi boatmen by a
crocodil which wa a particularli earli riser for it had pull
the poor fellow out of the cano in which he lai asleep at night now
howev the real danger were about to begin sinc at thi spot he
left the great river and start forward through the forest on foot with
jeeki and the four bearer whom he had paid highli to accompani him
he could not conceal from himself that the undertak seem somewhat
desper but of thi he said noth in the long letter he had written
to barbara on the previou night sigh as he seal it at the
thought that it might well be the last which would ever reach her from
him even if the boatmen got safe back to calabar and rememb to
put it in the post the enterpris had been begun and must be carri
through until it end in successor death
an hour later thei start first walk alan as leader of the
expedit carri a doublebarrel gun that could be us either
for ball or shot about fifti cartridg with brass case to protect
them from the damp a revolv a huntingknif a cloth mackintosh and
lastli strap upon hi back like a knapsack a tin box contain
the fetish littl bonsa which wa too preciou to be trust to anyon
els it wa quit a suffici load for ani white man in that climat
but be veri wiri alan did not feel it weight at ani rate at first
after him in singl file came the four porter laden with a small tent
some tin provis and brandi ammunit a box contain bead
watch etc for present blanket spare cloth and so forth these
were stalwart fellow enough who knew the forest but their deject
air show that now thei had come face to face with it danger thei
heartili wish themselv anywher els inde notwithstand their
terror of jeeki medicin at the last moment thei threw down their
load intend to make a wild rush for the depart boat onli to be
met by jeeki himself who anticip some such move wa wait for
them on the bank with a shotgun here he remain until the cano wa
too far out in the stream for them to reach it by swim then he
ask them if thei wish to sit and starv there with the devil he
would leav them for compani of if thei would carri out their bargain
like honest men
the end of it wa thei took up their load again and march while
behind them walk the terribl and gigant jeeki the barrel of
the shotgun which he carri at full cock and occasion us to
prod them point directli at their back a strang object he look
truli for in addit to the weapon with which he bristl sever
cookingpot were slung about him to sai noth of a cork mattress
and a mackintosh sheet ti in a flat bundl to hi shoulder a box
contain medicin and food which he carri on hi head and fasten
to the top of it with string like a helmet on a coffin an enorm
solartop stuf full of mosquito net of which the end fell
about him like a green veil when alan remonstr with him as to the
cork mattress suggest that it should be thrown awai as too hot to
wear jeeki repli that he had been cold for thirti year and wish
to get warm again guess that hi real reason for declin to part
with the articl wa that hi master should have someth to lie on
other than the damp ground alan said no more at the time which as
will be seen wa fortun enough for jeeki
for a mile or more their road ran through fantasticlook mangrov
tree root in the mud that in the mist resembl alan thought
manyleg arbor octopi feel for their food and tall reed on
the top of which sat crowd of chatter finch then just as the sun
broke out strongli cheer them with it warmth and suck up the
vapour thei enter spars bush with palm and great cotton tree
grow here and there and so at length came to the border of the
mighti forest
oh dark dark wa that forest he who enter it from the cheer
sunshin felt as though suddenli and without prepar he had wander
out of the light we know into some dim hade such as the old greek fanci
paint where strengthless ghost flit aimlessli mourn the lost
light everywher the giant bole of tree shoot the height of a
church tower into the air without a branch great ribroot tree and
beneath them a fierc and hungri growth of creeper where a tree had
fallen within the last centuri or so these creeper ramp upward in
luxuri their stem thick as the bodi of a man drink the shaft
of light that pierc downward drink it with eager er the
bough abov met again and starv them where no tree had fallen the
creeper were thin and weak from year to year thei live on feebli
bide their time but still thei live know that some dai it would
come and alwai it wa come to those expect parasit sinc from
minut to minut somewher in the vast depth mile and mile awai
perhap a great crash echo in the still the crash of a tree
that sown when the saxon rule in england or perhap befor cleopatra
bewitch anthoni came to it end at last
on the second dai of their march in the forest alan chanc to see such
a tree fall and the sight wa on that he never could forget as it
happen ow to the vast spread of it branch which had kill out
all rival beneath for in it dai it had been a veri success tree
embu with an excel constitut by it parent it stood somewhat
alon so that from sever hundr yard awai as these six human be
crept toward it like ant toward a sapl in a cornfield it mighti
girth and bulk set upon a littl mound and the luxuri green of
it farreach bough made a kind of landmark then in the hot noon
when no breath of wind stir suddenli the end came suddenli that
mighti bole seem to crumbl suddenli those farreach arm were
thrown togeth as their support fail grip at each other like
live thing flog the air scream in their last agoni and with
an aw wail groan sink a tumbl ruin to the earth
silenc again and in the midst of the silenc jeeki cheer voic
old tree go flop glad he no flop on us thank be to littl bonsa get
on you lazi nigger dog who pai you stand there and snivel get on or
i blow out your stupid skull and he brought the muzzl of the
fullcock doublebarrel gun into sharp contact with that part of
the terrifi porter anatomi
such wa the forest of their march through it for the first four
dai there is noth to tell it depth seem to be devoid of
life although occasion thei heard the scream of parrot in the
treetop a coupl of hundr feet abov or caught sight of the dim
shape of monkei swing themselv from bough to bough that wa in
the daytim when although thei could not see it thei knew that the
sun wa shine somewher but at night thei heard noth sinc beast
of prei do not come where there is no food what puzzl alan wa that
all through these impenetr recess there ran a distinct road
which thei follow to the right and left rose a wall of creeper but
between them ran thi road an ancient road for noth grew on it and
it onli turn asid to avoid the biggest of the tree which must have
stood there from time immemori such a tree as that which he had seen
fall inde it wa on of those round which the road ran
he ask jeeki who made the road
peopl who come out noah ark answer jeeki i think thei run up
here to get out of wai of water and sent them two eleph ahead to
make path or perhap dwarf peopl make it or perhap those who go up
to asikiland to do sacrific like old jew
you mean you dont know said alan
no of cours dont know who know about forest path made befor
begin of world you ask question major i answer more live
answer than to shake head and roll ey like them silli fool porter
it wa on the fourth night that the troubl began as usual thei had lit
a huge fire made of the fallen bough and rot tree trunk that lai
about in plenti there wa no reason why the fire should be so larg
sinc thei had littl to cook and the air wa hot but thei made it
so for the same reason that jeeki answer question for the sake of
cheer at least it gave light in the dark leap up in red
tongu of flame twenti or thirti feet high and it roar and crackl
were welcom in the primev silenc
alan lai upon the cork mattress in the open for here there wa no need
to pitch the tent if ani rain fell abov the canopi of leav absorb
it he wa amus himself while he smoke hi pipe with watch the
reflect of the firelight against a patch of dark caus probabl
by some bush about twenti yard awai and by pictur in hi own mind
the face of barbara that strong pleasant english face as it might
appear on such a background suddenli there on the ident spot he
did see a face though on of a veri differ charact it wa round
and small and hideou resembl in it gener outlin that of a
bloat child at thi distanc he could not distinguish the featur
except the lip which were larg and pendul and between them the
flash of white teeth
look here he whisper to jeeki in english and jeeki look then
without sai a word lift the shotgun that lai at hi side and fire
straight at the bush instantli there aros a squeak nois such as
might be made by a wound anim and the four porter sprang up in
alarm
sit down said jeeki to them in their own tongu a leopard wa
stalk us and i fire to frighten it awai dont go near the place
as it mai be wound and angri but drag up some bough and make a fenc
round the fire for fear of other
the men who dread leopard look on these anim inde with
superstiti rever obei readili enough and as there wa plenti
of wood ly within a few yard soon construct a boma fenc that
rough as it wa would serv for protect
jeeki said alan present as thei labour at the fenc that wa
not a leopard it wa a man
no no major not man littl dwarf devil him that have poison
arrow i shoot at onc to make him sit up think he no come back
tonight too much afraid of shot fetish but tomorrow cant sai not
tell those fellow anyth and he nod toward the porter or
perhap thei bolt
i think you would have done better to leav the dwarf alon said
alan and thei might have left us alon now thei will have a blood
feud against us
not agre major onli chanc for us put him in blue funk if i not
shoot present he shoot and he made a sound that resembl the
whistl of an arrow then ad now you go sleep i not tire i
watch my ey see in dark better than your onli two more dai of thi
damn forest then open land with tree here and there where dwarf no
come becaus he afraid of lion and cannib man who like eat him
as there wa noth els to be done alan took jeeki advic and in
time fell fast asleep nor did he wake again till the faint light which
for the want of a better name thei call dawn wa filter down to
them through the canopi of bough
been to look said jeeki as he hand him hi coffe hit that dwarf
man see hi blood but think other carri him awai jeeki veri good
shot stone spear arrow or gun all same to him now get off as quick
as we can befor porter smell a rat you eat chop major i pack
present thei start on their trudg through those endless tree
with fear for a companion even the porter who had been told noth
seem more afraid than usual though whether thi wa becaus thei
smell rat as jeeki call it or ow to the progress breakdown
of their nervou system alan did not know about middai thei stop
to eat becaus the men were too tire to walk further without rest for
an hour or more thei had been look for a compar open place
but as it chanc could find none so were oblig to halt in dens
forest just as thei had finish their meal and were prepar to
proce that which thei had fear happen sinc from somewher
behind the tree bole came a vollei of reed arrow on struck a porter
in the neck on fix itself in alan helmet without touch him
and no less than three hit jeeki on the back and stuck there
providenti enough in the substanc of the cork mattress that he
still carri on hi shoulder which the feebl shaft had not the
strength to pierc
everybodi sprang up and with a curiou fascin instead of attempt
to do anyth watch the porter who had been hit in the neck
somewher in the region of the jugular vein the poor man rose to hi
feet with great deliber remind alan in some grotesqu wai of a
speaker who ha suddenli been call on to address a meet and seek
to gain time for the gather of hi thought then he turn
toward that vast audienc of the tree stretch out hi hand with a
declamatori gestur said someth in a compos voic and fell upon
hi face stone dead the swift poison had reach hi heart and done it
work
hi three companion look at him for a moment and the next with a yell
of terror rush off into the forest hurl down their load as thei
ran what becam of them alan never learn for he saw them no more
and the dwarf peopl keep their secret at the time inde he scarc
notic their departur for he wa otherwis engag
on of their hideou littl assail made bold by success ventur
to run across an open space between two tree show himself for
a moment alan had a gun in hi hand and mad with rage at what had
happen he rais it and swung on him as he would upon a rabbit he
wa a quick and practis shot and hi skill did not fail him now for
just as the dwarf wa vanish behind a tree the bullet caught him and
next instant he wa seen roll over and over upon it further side
that veri nice said jeeki reflect veri nice inde but i
think we best move out of thi
arent you hurt gasp alan your back is full of arrow
dont feel noth major he answer best cork mattress 253 at
store veri good for poison arrow but leav him behind now becaus
perhap point work through as i run on scratch do trick and as
he spoke jeeki unti a string or sever string let the littl
mattress fall to the ground
great piti leav all those good said jeeki survei the load
that the porter had cast awai but what sai book life more than
raiment also take no thought for morrow dwarf peopl do that for us
come major make track and dash at a bag of cartridg which he
cast about hi neck a trifl addit to hi other impedimenta and
a small case of pot meat that he hitch under hi arm he poke hi
master in the back with the muzzl of hi fullcock gun as a signal
that it wa time to start
keep that curs thing off me said alan furious how often have i
told you never to carri firearm at full cock
about on thousand time major answer jeeki imperturb but
on such occas forget discreet my ma just same it run in famili
but stori too long tell you now cut major cut like hell them dwarf
be back soon but he puf i think i think littl bonsa come
squar with them on dai
so alan cut and the huge jeeki blunder along after him the
paraphernalia with which he wa hung about rattl like the hoof of a
gallop giraff nor for all hi load did he ever turn a hair whether
it were fear within or a desir to save hi master or a belief in the
virtu of littl bonsa or that hi foot wa as it were onc more
upon hi nativ heath the fact remain that notwithstand the
fifti year almost that had whiten hi wool jeeki wa absolut
inexhaust at least at the end of that fear chase which last
all the dai and through the night also for thei dare not camp he
appear to be nearli as fresh as when he start from old calabar nor
did hi spirit fail him for on moment
when the light came on the follow morn howev thei perceiv
by mani sign and token that the dwarf peopl were all about them some
arrow were shot even but these fell short
pooh said jeeki all right now thei much afraid still no time
for coffe we best get on
so thei got on as thei could till toward middai the forest began to
thin out now as the light grew stronger thei could see the dwarf of
whom there appear to be sever hundr keep a parallel cours
to their own on either side of them at what thei thought to be a safe
distanc
try on shot i think said jeeki kneel down and let fly at
a clump of the littl men which scatter like a covei of partridg
leav on of it number kick on the ground ah my boi shout
jeeki in deris how you like bullet in tummi you not know paradox
guarante flat trajectori 250 yard you rememb that next time
sonni then off thei went again up a long rise
river other side of that rise said jeeki think those treemonkei
no follow us there
but the monkei appear to be angri and determin thei would not
come ani more within the rang of the paradox but thei still march
on either side of the two fugit know well that at last their
strength must fail and thei would be abl to creep up and murder them
so the chase went on till alan began to wonder whether it would not be
better to face the end at onc
no no if sai die cant chang mind tomorrow morn gasp jeeki
in a hoars voic here top rise much nearer than i thought oh my
aunt who those and he point to a larg number of big men arm with
spear who were march up the further side of the hill from the river
that ran below
at the same moment these savag who were not more than two hundr
yard awai caught sight of them and of their pursuer who just then
appear on the ridg to the right and left the dwarf on perceiv
these stranger utter a shrill yell of terror and wheel about to
fly to their fast in the forest which evid thei regret
ever have left it wa too late with an answer shout the
spearsmen who were extend in a long line appar hunt for
game charg after them at full speed thei were fresh and their leg
were long therefor veri soon thei overtook the dwarf and even got
in front of them head them off from the forest the end mai
be guessedsav a few whom thei reserv aliv thei kill them
mercilessli and almost without loss to themselv sinc the littl
forest folk were too terrifi and exhaust to shoot at them with their
poison arrow and thei had no other weapon
in fact as alan discov afterward for gener there had been
war between them sinc all the other tribe hate the dwarf whom thei
look upon as danger human monkei and never befor had the big men
found such a chanc of squar their account
when jeeki saw thi fearfullook compani for the first time hi
spirit seem to fail him
ogula he exclaim with a groan and sat himself upon a flat rock
pull alan down besid him ogula know them by hair and spear he
repeat up gum tree now sai goodnight
why who ar thei gasp alan
great cannib major eat man eat us tonight or perhap tomorrow
morn when we nice and cool sai prayer major quick no time wast
i think i will shoot an ogula or two first said alan grimli as he
stood up and lift hi gun
no not shoot no good pretend not be afraid best chanc let jeeki
think let jeeki think and he slap hi forehead with hi larg
hand
appar the action brought inspir for next instant he grab
hi master by the arm and drag him back behind the shelter of a
big boulder which thei had just pass then with realli marvel
swift he cut the strap of the tin box that alan wore upon hi back
and sinc there wa no time to find the kei and unlock it seiz the
littl padlock with which it wa fasten between hi finger and thumb
and put out hi great strength with a singl wrench twist it off
what ar you began alan
hold tongu he answer savag make you god i priest ogula know
littl bonsa quick quick
in a minut it wa done the golden mask wa clap on to alan head
and the leather thong were fasten moreov jeeki himself wa
arrai in the solartop to which all thi while he had clung allow
stream of green mosquito net to hang down over hi white robe
come out now major he said and plai god you whistl i do
palav
then hand in hand thei walk from behind the rock by thi time the
particular compani of the cannib that wa opposit to them which
happen to includ their chief had climb the steep slope of the hill
and arriv within a distanc of twenti yard have seen the two men
and guess that thei had taken refug behind the rock their spear
were lift to kill them sinc when he behold anyth strang the
first impuls of a savag is to bring it to it death thei look thei
saw of a sudden down went the rais spear
some of those who held them fell upon their face while other turn
to fly appal by the vision of thi strang clad man with the head
of gold onli their chief a great yellowtooth fellow who wore a
necklac of baboon claw remain erect stare at them with open
mouth
alan blew the whistl that wa set between the lip of the mask and
thei shiver then jeeki spoke to them in some tongu which thei
understood sai

chapter ix
the dawn
jeeki look up and down the river and saw that in the centr of it
about half a mile awai there wa an island on which grew some tree
littl bonsa will camp yonder he said go make her hous readi

the congeni work of hunt and kill the dwarf not to dare to
approach the white man and hi companion a third parti ran to the bank
of the river that wa opposit to the island to make readi as thei had
been bidden so that present alan and jeeki were left quit alon
ah said jeeki with a gasp of satisfact that all right
everyth arrang quit comfort thought littl bonsa come out top
somehow and score off dirti dwarf monkei thei never get home to tea

so gather togeth what remain of their few possess thei
start leisur down the slope toward the island and as thei went
jeeki explain all that had happen sinc ogula wa not on of the
african languag with which alan wa acquaint and he had onli been
abl to understand a word here and there
look said jeeki when he had finish and turn he point to the
cannib who were drive the few survivor of the dwarf befor them
to the spot where their cano were beach those dwarf done for
capit busi forest road quit safe to travel home by ogula best
friend in world veri remark escap from delic situat
veri remark inde said alan i shall soon begin to believ in
the luck of littl bonsa

present then he look about him and in a kind of aimless manner
lift hi gun and fire there we ar he said littl bonsa

in it form against a stone where it now lai shot through the head and
dy no further troubl on score of grub for next three dai he
ad come on to camp major i send on savag skin and bring that
buck
so on thei went to the river bank alan so tire now that the excit
wa over that he wa not sorri to lean upon jeeki arm reach the
stream thei drank deep of it water and find that it wa shallow at
thi spot wade through it to the island without wait for a cano
to ferri them over here thei found a parti of the cannib alreadi at
work clear reed with their larg curv knive in order to make a
site for the hut anoth parti under the command of their chief himself
had gone to the top end of the island to cut the stem of a willowlik
shrub to serv as upright these peopl stare at alan which wa not
strang as thei had never befor seen the face of a white man and were
wonder doubtless what had becom of the ancient and terribl fetish
that he had worn without enter into explan jeeki in a great
voic order two of them to fetch the buck which the white man whom
he describ as husband of the goddess had slain by thunder when
these had depart upon their errand leav jeeki to superintend the
build oper alan sat down upon a fallen tree watch on of
the savag make fire with a point stick and some tinder
just then from the head of the island where the willow were be
cut rose the sound of loud roar and of men cry out in affright
seiz hi gun alan ran toward the spot whenc the nois came forc
hi wai through a brake of reed he saw a curiou sight the ogula in
cut the willow which grew about some tumbl rock had disturb
a lioness that had her lair there and be fearless savag had tri
to kill her with their spear the brute render desper by wound
and the imposs of escap for here the surround water wa
deep had charg them boldli and as it chanc fell to the ground
their chief that yellowtooth man to whom jeeki gave hi order now
she wa stand over him look round her royal her great paw upon
hi breast which it seem almost to cover while the ogula ran round
and round shout for thei fear that if thei tri to attack her
she would kill the chief thi inde she seem about to do for just
as alan arriv she drop her head as though to tear out the man
throat instantli he fire it wa a snap shot but as it chanc a
good on for the bullet struck the lioness in the back of the neck just
forward of and between the shoulder sever the spine so that without
a sound or ani further movement she sank stone dead upon the prostrat
cannib for a while hi follow stood astonish thei might have
heard of gun from the coast peopl but live as thei did in the
interior where white folk did not dare to travel thei had never seen
their terribl effect
magic thei cri magic
of cours exclaim jeeki who by now had arriv upon the scene
what els did you expect from the husband of littl bonsa magic the
greatest of magic go roll that beast awai befor your chief is crush
to death
thei obei and the man sat up a fear spectacl for he wa
smother with the blood of the lion and somewhat cut by her claw
though otherwis unhurt then feel that the life wa still whole in
him he crept on hi hand and knee to where alan stood and kiss hi
feet
aha said jeeki littl bonsa score again cannib tribe our slave
henceforth for evermor ye till kingdom come come on major and
cook supper in perfect peac
the supper wa cook and eaten with gratitud for seldom had two men
need a squar meal more and never did venison tast better by the
time that it wa finish dark had fallen and befor thei turn in
to sleep in the neat reed hut that the ogula had built alan and jeeki
walk up the island to see if the lioness had been skin as thei
direct thi thei found wa done even the carcas itself had been
remov to serv as meat for these foulfeed peopl thei climb on
to the pile of rock in which the beast had made her lair and look
down the river to where two hundr yard awai the ogula were
encamp from thi camp there rose a sound of revelri and by the light
of the great fire that burn there thei perceiv that the hungri
savag were busi feast for some of them sat in circl whilst
other their nake form look at that distanc like those of imp in
the infern region flit to and fro against the glow background
of the fire bear strangelook joint on prong of wood
i suppos thei ar eat the lioness said alan doubtfulli
no no major not lioness eat dwarf by dozenjust like oyster
at seasid but for littl bonsa we sit on those fork now and look
uncommon small
beast said alan in disgust thei make me feel uncommon sick let us
go to bed i suppos thei wont murder us in our sleep will thei
not thei major too much afraid also we their bloodbroth now
becaus we bring them firstclass dinner and save chief from lion
furi no blame them too much major good fellow realli with gentl
heart but grub like that from gener to gener everi mother
son of them have mani men insid that why thei so big and strong ogula
peopl cover great multitud like chariti in book no doubt sent by
provid to keep down extra poplat not right to think too hard
of poor fellow who as i sai veri kind and gentl at heart and most
love in famili relat except to old women whom thei eat also so
that thei no get bore with too long life
weari and disgust by thi abomin sight though he wa alan burst
out laugh at hi retain apolog for the sweetnatur ogula who
struck him as the most repuls blackguard that he had ever met or
heard of in all hi experi of african savag then wish to see
and hear no more of them that night he retreat rapidli to the hut
and wa soon fast asleep with hi head pillow on the box that hid the
charm of littl bonsa when he awok it wa broad daylight rise he
went down to the river to wash and never had a bath been more welcom
for dure all their journei through the forest no such thing wa
obtain on hi return he found hi garment well brush with dry
reed and set upon a rock in the hot sun to air while jeeki in a
cheer mood wa engag cook breakfast in the fryingpan to which
he had clung through all the vicissitud of their flight
no coffe major he said regretfulli that stop in forest but never
mind hot water better for nerv ogula messeng gone in littl cano
to asiki at break of dai travel slow till thei work off dwarf but
afterward go quick i send lion skin with them as present from you to
great highpriestess asika also claw for necklac no lion there and
she think much of that also it make her love mighti man who can kill
fierc lion like samson in book love of head woman veri valuabl alli
among beastli savag peopl
i am sure i hope it wont said alan with earnest but no doubt
it is as well to keep on the soft side of the good ladi if we can what
time do we start
in on hour major i been to camp alreadi chosen best cano and
finest men for rower chiefh call fannyso grate that he come
with them himself
inde that is veri kind of him but i sai jeeki what ar these
fellow go to live on i cant stand what you call their favourit
chop
no no major that all right i tell them that when thei travel with
littl bonsa thei must keep lent like piou roman cathol famili that
live near yarlei thei catch plenti fish in river and perhap we shoot
game or rich potamu which thei like caus he fat
evid the ogula chief fahni by name not fanni as jeeki call
him wa a man of hi word for befor the hour wa up he appear at
the island in command of a larg cano man by twelv splendidlook
savag spring to land he prostrat himself befor alan kiss
hi feet as he had done on the previou night and make a long speech
that veri good spirit exclaim jeeki like to see heathen in hi
dark lick white gentleman boot he sai you hi lord and great
magician who save hi life and know all littl bonsa secret which
mani and unrepeat he sai he die for you twice a dai if need be and
go on dy tomorrow and all next year he sai he take you safe till
you meet asiki and for your sake though he hungri eat no man for on
whole month or perhap longer now we start at onc
so thei start up the river that wa call katsena alan and jeeki
seat in a lordli fashion near the stern of the cano beneath an awn
made out of some stick and a grass mat in truth after their sever
toil and adventur in the forest thi method of journei prove
quit luxuri except for a rapid here and there over or round which
the cano must be drag the river wa broad and the sceneri on it
bank parklik and beauti moreov the countri perhap ow
to the appetit of the ogula appear to be practic uninhabit
except by vast herd of everi sort of game
all dai thei sat in the cano which the stalwart rower propel in
silenc for the most part sinc thei were terribl afraid of the white
man and still more so of the renown fetish which thei knew he carri
with him then when even came thei moor their craft to the bank
and camp till the follow morn nor did thei lack for food sinc
game be so plenti it wa onli necessari for alan to walk a few
hundr yard and shoot a fat eland or hartebeest or other buck
which in it ignor of gun would allow him to approach quit close
eleph rhinocero and buffalo were also common while great herd
of giraff might be seen wander between the scatter tree but as
thei were not upon a hunt trip and their ammunit wa veri limit
with these thei did not interfer
have their daili fill of meat which their soul love the ogula
oarsmen remain in an excel mood inde the chief fahni inform
alan that if onli thei had such magic tube wherewith to slaughter game
he and hi tribe would gladli give up cannibalismexcept on feast dai
he ad sadli that soon thei would be oblig to do so or die sinc
in those part there were now few peopl left to eat and thei hate
veget moreov thei kept no cattl it wa not the custom of that
tribe except a veri few for milk alan advis them to increas their
herd sinc as he point out to them dog should not eat dog or the
human be hi own kind
the chief answer that there wa a great deal in what he said which
on hi return he would lai befor hi head men inde alan to hi
astonish discov that jeeki had been quit right when he
alleg that these peopl so terribl in their mode of life were
yet kind and gentl at heart thei prei upon mankind becaus for
centuri it had been their custom so to do but if anyon had been
there to show them a better wai he grew sure that thei would follow it
gladli at least thei were brave and loyal and even after their first
fear of the white man had worn off fulfil their promis without a
murmur onc inde when he chanc to have gone for a walk unarm
and to be charg by a bull eleph these ogula ran at the brute with
their spear and drove it awai a rescu in which on of them lost hi
life for the rogu caught and kill him
so the dai went on while thei paddl leisur up the river alan
emploi the time by take lesson in the asiki tongu from jeeki a
languag which he had been studi ever sinc he left england the task
wa not easi as he had no book and jeeki himself after some thirti
year of absenc wa doubt as to mani of it detail still be a
linguist by natur and educ and find in the tongu similar
to other african dialect which he knew he wa now abl to speak it a
littl in a halt fashion
on the fifth dai of their ascent of the river thei came to a tributari
that flow into it from the north up which the ogula said thei
must proce to reach asikiland the stream wa narrow and sluggish
widen out here and there into great swamp through which it wa not
easi to find a channel also the district wa so unhealthi that even
sever of the ogula contract fever of which alan cure them by heavi
dose of quinin for fortun hi travel medicin chest remain
to him these cure were effect after their chief suggest that thei
should be thrown overboard or left to die in the swamp as useless
with the result that the white man magic power were thenceforth
establish beyond doubt or cavil inde the poor ogula now look
on him as a god superior even to littl bonsa whose familiar he wa
suppos to be
the journei through that swamp wa veri try sinc in thi wet season
often thei could find no place on which to sleep at night but must stai
in the cano torment by mosquito and in constant danger of be
upset by the hippopotami that live there moreov as no game wa now
avail thei were oblig to live on these beast fish when thei
could catch them and wildfowl which sometim thei were unabl to cook
for lack of fuel thi did not troubl the ogula who at them raw as
did jeeki when he wa hungri but alan wa oblig to starv until thei
could make a fire thi it wa onli possibl to do when thei found drift
or other wood sinc at that season the rank veget wa in full
growth also the fear thunderstorm which broke continu and in a
few minut half fill their cano with water made the reed and the
soil on which thei grew sodden with wet as jeeki said
thi time of year onli fit for duck and crocodil human should
rememb uncontrol forc of natur and wait till winter come in
due cours when quagmir bear sole of hi foot
thi elabor remark he made to alan dure the progress of a
particularli fear tempest the lightn blaze in the black sky
and seem to strike all about them like stab sword of fire the
thunder crash and bellow as it mai be suppos that it will do on
that dai when the great earth worn out at last shall reel and stagger
to it doom the rain fell in a straight and solid sheet the tall reed
wave confusedli like million of dim arm and while thei wave utter
a vast and groan nois the scare wildfowl in their terror with
scream and the sough of wing rush past them in flock a thousand
strong now seen and now lost in the vapour to keep their cano afloat
the poor nake ogula oarsmen shiver with cold and fear bale
furious with their hand or bowl of hollow wood and call back
to alan to save them as though he were the master of the element even
jeeki wa depress and appear to be offer up petit though
whether these were direct to littl bonsa or elsewher it wa
imposs to know
as for alan the heart wa out of him it is true that so far he had
escap fever or other sick which in itself wa wonder but he
wa chill through and through and practic had eaten noth for
two dai and veri littl for a week sinc hi stomach turn from
halfcook hippopotamu fat and wildfowl moreov thei had lost the
channel and seem to be wander aimlessli through a wilder of
reed broken here and there by line of deeper water
accord the ogula thei should have reach the confin of the great
lake sever dai befor and land on health rise ground that
wa part of the asiki territori but thi had not happen and now he
doubt whether it ever would happen it wa more like that thei would
come to their death there in the marsh especi as the few ball and
shot cartridg which thei had save in their flight were now exhaust
not on wa left noth wa left except their revolv with some
charg which of cours were quit useless for the kill of game
therefor thei were in a fair wai to die of hunger for here if fish
exist thei refus to be caught and nought remain for them to fill
themselv with except water slug and snail which the boatmen were
alreadi gather and crunch up in their great teeth or perhap
the ogula forget friendship under the pressur of necess would
murder them as thei slept andrevert to their usual diet
jeeki wa right he should have rememb the uncontrol forc
of natur onli a madman would have undertaken such an expedit in
the rain no wonder that the asiki remain a secret and hidden peopl
when their frontier wa protect by such a marsh as thi upon the on
side and as he understood by impass mountain upon the other
there came a lull in the tempest and the boatmen began to get the better
of the water which now wa up to their knee alan ask jeeki if he
thought it wa over but that worthi shook hi white head mournfulli
caus the sprai to fly as from a twirl mop and repli
cant sai cat and dog not tumbl so mani for present onli pup and
kitti left so to speak but think there plenti more up there and he
nod at the portent firelac cloud which seem to be spread
over them it black edg visibl even through the gloom
bad busi i am afraid jeeki shouldnt have brought you here or
those poor beggar either and he look at the scare frozen ogula
i begin to wonder
never wonder major broke in jeeki in alarm if wonder not
live if wonder not be born too much wonder about everywher cant
understand noth so give it up sai righto and devil hindermost
veri good motto for bipe in tight place better drown here than in citi
bucket shop but no drown should be dead long ago but littl bonsa
plai the game she not want to sink in stink swamp when so near her
happi home come out all right somehow as from dwarf everi cloud have
silver line major even that black chap up there oh my golli
thi last exclam wa wrung from jeeki lip by a sudden
develop of forc of natur which astonish even him instead of
a silver line the black chap exhibit on of gold in an instant it
seem to turn to acr of flame it wa as though the heaven had taken
fire a flash or a thunderbolt struck the water within ten yard of
their cano caus the boatmen to throw themselv upon their face
through shock or terror then came the hurrican which fortun wa
so strong that it permit no more rain to fall the tall reed were
beaten flat beneath it breath the cano wa seiz in it grip and
whirl round and round then driven forward like an arrow onli the
weight of the men and the water in it prevent it from overset
dens dark fell upon them and although thei could see no star thei
knew that it must be night on thei rush driven by that shriek
gale and all about and around them thi wall of dark no on spoke
for hope wa abandon and if thei had their voic could not have
been heard the last thing that alan rememb wa feel jeeki
drag a grass mat over him to protect him a littl if he could then
hi sens waver as doe a dy lamp he thought that he wa back in
what jeeki had rude call citi bucket shop bargain across the
telephon wire upon which came all the sound of the infern region
with a financi paper for an articl on a littl bonsa syndic that
he propos to float he thought he wa in the court wood with barbara
onli the bird in the tree sang so unnatur loud that he could not
hear her voic and she wore littl bonsa on her head as a bonnet then
she depart in flame leav him and death alon
alan awok abov the sun shone hotli warm him back to life but in
front wa a thick wall of mist and rise beyond it in the distanc he
saw the rug swell form of mountain doubtless these had been
visibl befor but the tall reed through which thei travel had
hid the sight of them he look behind him and there in a heap lai the
ogula around their chief insens or sleep he count them and
found that two were gone lost in the tempest how or where no man ever
learn he look forward and saw a peculiar sight for in the prow of
the drift cano stood jeeki clad in the remain of hi white robe
and wear on hi head the batter helmet and about hi shoulder the
torn fragment of green mosquito net while alan wa wonder strang
why he had adopt thi ceremoni garb from out of the mist there came
a sound of sing of wild and solemn sing jeeki seem to listen
to it then he lift up hi great music voic and sang as though in
answer what he sang alan could not understand but he recogn that
the languag which he us wa that of the asiki peopl
a paus and a confus murmur and now again the wild song rose and
again jeeki answer
what the deuc ar you do where ar we ask alan faintli
jeeki turn and beam upon him although hi teeth were chatter
and hi face wa hollow still he beam
you awak major he said thought good old sun do trick feel your
heart now and find it beat puls too strong though tempratur
not normal well good new thi morn littl bonsa come out top as
usual asiki priest on bank there cant see them but know their song
and answer same old game as thirti year ago asiki never chang which
good busi when you been awai long while
hang the asiki said alan feebli i think all these poor beggar ar

look like it major but what that matter now sinc you and i aliv
plenti more where thei come from not dead though think onli sleep no
like cold like dormous but never mind cannib pig thei serv our
turn if thei live live if thei die die and god have merci on soul
if cannib have soul ah here we ar and from beneath six inch of
water he drag up the tin box contain littl bonsa from which he
extract the fetish wet but uninjur

as announc on bill and god bless hurrican that blow us here when we
expect die come major quick quick mist melt and soon thei see you
then without wait for an answer jeeki clap the wet mask on hi
master head ti the thong and led alan to the prow of the cano
where he set him down on a littl cross bench stood behind support
him and again began to sing in a great triumphant voic
the mist clear awai roll up like a curtain and reveal on the
shore a number of men and women clad in white robe who were martial
in rank there chant and stare out at the dim water of the
lagoon yonder upon the water driven forward by the gentl breez
float a cano and lo in the prow of that cano sat a white man and
on hi head the god which thei had lost a whole gener gone on
the head of a white man it had depart on the head of a white man it
return thei saw and fell upon their knee
blow major blow whisper jeeki and alan blew a feebl note
through the whistl in the mouth of the mask it wa enough thei knew
it thei sprang into the water and drag the cano to land thei set
alan on the shore and worship him thei hale up a lad as though for
sacrific for a priest flourish a great knife abov hi head but
jeeki said someth that caus them to let him go alan thought it
wa to the effect that littl bonsa had chang her habit across the
black water and want no blood onli food then he rememb no more
again the dark fell upon him
chapter x
bonsa town
when conscious return to alan the first thing of which he becam
dimli awar wa the slow swai motion of a litter he rais himself
for he wa ly at full length and in so do felt that there wa
someth over hi face
that confound littl bonsa he thought am i expect to spend the
rest of my life with it on my head like the man in the iron mask
then he put up hi hand and felt the thing to find that it wa not
littl bonsa but someth made appar of thin fine linen fit
to the shape of hi face for there wa a nose on it and eyehol
through which he could see ye and a mouth whereof the lip by some
ingeni contriv could be move up and down
littl bonsa undress uniform i expect he mutter and tri to
drag it off thi howev prove to be imposs for it wa fit
tightli to hi head and lace or fasten at the back of hi neck so
secur that he could not undo it be still weak soon he gave up
the attempt and began to look about him
he wa in a litter a veri fine litter hung round with beautifulli
woven and colour grass mat insid of which were a kind of couch and
cushion of soft wool or hair so arrang that he could either sit up
or lie down he peep between two of these mat and saw that thei were
travel in a mountain countri over a wellbeaten road or trail
and that hi litter wa born upon the shoulder of a doubl line of
whiterob men while all around him march number of other men thei
seem to be soldier for thei were arrang in compani and carri
larg spear and shield also some of them wore torqu and bracelet
of yellow metal that might be either brass or gold turn himself
about he found an eyehol in the back of the litter so contriv that
it occup could see without be seen and perceiv that hi escort
amount to a verit armi of splendidlook but sombrefac
savag of a somewhat semit cast of counten inde mani of them
had aquilin featur and hair that although crisp wa long and
carefulli arrang in someth like the old egyptian fashion also
he saw that about thirti yard behind and separ from him by a
bodyguard wa born a second litter by mean of a similar apertur in
front he discov yet more soldier and beyond them at the head of
the process wa what appear to be a bodi of whiterob men and
women bear strang emblem and banner these he took to be priest
and priestess
have examin everyth that wa within reach of hi ey alan sank
back upon hi cushion and began to realiz that he wa veri faint and
hungri it wa just then that the sound of a familiar voic reach hi
ear it wa the voic of jeeki and he did not speak he chant in
english to a melodi which alan at onc recogn as a gregorian tone
appar from the second litter
oh major he sang have you yet awok from refreeesh sleep
if so pleas answer me in same tone of voic for rememb that you

bring you chop becaus too iiinfra dig for now i also biggish bug
the littl bird what sit upon the rose as poet saaai i tell these
johnni bring you grub which you eat without qualm for asiki al

then follow loud order issu by jeeki to hi immedi entourag
and some confus
as a result present alan litter wa halt the curtain were open
and kneel women thrust through them platter of wood upon which
wrap up in leav were the dismemb limb of a bird which he took
to be chicken or guineafowl and a gold cup contain water pleasantli
flavour with some essenc thi cup interest him veri much both on
account of it shape and workmanship which if rude wa strike
in design resembl those drink vessel that have been found in
mycenian grave also it prove to him that jeeki stori of
the abund of the preciou metal among the asiki had not been
exagger if it were not veri plenti thei would scarc he
thought make their travel cup of gold evid there wa wealth
in the land
after the food had been hand to him the litter went on again and
seat upon hi cushion he at and drank heartili enough for now that
the worst of hi fatigu had pass awai hi hunger wa great in some
absurd fashion thi meal remind him of that which a travel make
out of a luncheon basket upon a railwai line in europ or america
onli there the cup ar not of gold and among the asiki were no paper
napkin no salt and mustard and no three and sixpenc or dollar to
pai further until he got us to it luncheon in a linen mask with
a moveabl mouth wa not easi thi difficulti he overcam at last by
prop the imit lip apart with a piec of bone after which
thing were easier
when he had finish he threw the platter and the remain out of the
litter retain the cup for further examin and recommenc hi
inton and poetic convers with jeeki
to set it out at length would be wearisom but in the cours of an hour
or so he collect a good deal of inform thu he learn that thei
were due to arriv at the asiki citi which wa call bonsa town by
nightfal or a littl after also he wa inform that the mask he wore
wa as he had guess a kind of undress uniform without which he must
never appear sinc for anyon except the asika herself to look upon the
nake counten of an individu so mysteri mix up with littl
bonsa wa sacrileg of the worst sort inde jeeki assur him that
the priest who had put on the headdress when he wa insens were
first blindfold

linen mask for an indefinit period wa not cheer recov he
chant a queri as to the fate of the ogula crew and their chief fahni
not dead inton jeeki in repli and not gone back aall aliveo
somewher behind there fanni veri sick about it for he think asiki
bring them along for sacrific pooor beggar
final he inquir where littl bonsa wa and wa answer that he
himself as it law guardian wa sit on the fetish in it tin
box tide that he wa abl to verifi by grope beneath the cushion
after thi hi voic gave out though jeeki continu to sing item of
interest new from time to time inde there were other thing that
absorb alan attent look through the peephol and crack in
the curtain he saw that at last thei had reach the crest of a ridg
up which thei had been climb for hour befor them lai a vast and
fertil vallei much of which seem to be under cultiv and down
it flow a broad and placid river opposit to him and face west a
great tongu of land ran up to a wall of mountain with stark precipic
of black rock that seem to be hundr or even thousand of feet
high and at the tip of thi tongu a mighti waterfal rush over
the precipic look at that distanc like a cascad of smoke thi
torrent which he rememb wa call raaba fell into a great pool
and there divid itself into two rush branch that enclos
an ellips of ground surround on all side by water for on it
westernmost extrem the branch met again and after flow a while
as on river divid onc more and wound awai quietli to north and
south further than the ey could reach on the island thu form which
mai have been three mile long by two in breadth stood thousand of
strawroof squarebuilt hut with veranda neatli arrang in block
and line and have between them street that were edg with palm
on the hither side of the pool wa what look like a park for here
grew great black tree which from their flat shape alan took to be
some varieti of cedar and stand alon in the midst of thi park
where no other habit could be discov wa a larg low
build with darkcolour wall and gabl roof that flash like
fire
the gold hous said alan to himself with a gasp so it is not a
dream or a lie
the detail at that distanc he could not discov nor did he try to
do so for the gener glori of the scene held him in it grip at thi
even hour for a littl while the level rai of the set sun
pour straight up the huge waterhollow kloof thei struck upon the
face of the fall stain it and the cloud of mist that hung abov
to a hundr gloriou hue inde the substanc of the foam water
seem to be interlac with rainbow whereof the arch reach their
crest and the feet were lost in the sullen black of the pool
beneath beauti too wa the vallei glow in the quiet light of
even and even the nativ town thu gild and glorifi look like
some happi home of peac
the sun wa sink rapidli and befor the litter reach the foot of
the hill and began to cross the rich vallei all the glori had depart
and onli the cataract show white and ghostlik through the gloom
but still the light which seem to gather to itself gleam upon that
golden roof amid the cedar tree then the moon rose and the gold wa
turn to silver alan lai back upon hi cushion full of wonder almost
of aw it wa a marvel thing that he should have live to reach
thi secret place hidden in the heart of africa and defend by swamp
mountain and savag to which so far as he knew onli on white man
had ever penetr and to think of it that white man hi own uncl
had never even held it worth while to make public ani account of it
wonder which appar had seem to him of no import or perhap
he thought that if he did he would not be believ well there thei
were befor and about him and now the question wa what would be hi
fate in thi gold hous where the great fetish dwelt with it priestess
ah that priestess somehow he shiver a littl when he thought of her
it wa as though her influenc were over him alreadi next moment he
forgot her for a while for thei had come to the river brink and the
litter wa be carri on to a barg or ferri about which were
gather mani arm men evid the gold hous wa well defend both
by natur and otherwis the ferri wa pull or row across the river
he could not see which and thei pass through a gatewai into the town
and up a broad street where hundr of peopl watch hi advent thei
did not seem to speak or if thei spoke their voic were lost in the
sound of the thunder of the great cataract which domin the place
with it sullen continu roar it took alan dai to becom accustom
to that roar but by the inhabit of asikiland appar it wa not
notic their ear and voic were attun to overcom it volum which
their father had known from the begin
present thei were through the town and a wooden gate in an inner wall
which surround the park where the cedar grew at thi spot alan note
that everybodi left them except the bearer and a few men whom he took
to be priest on thei stole like ghost beneath the mighti tree from
whose limb hung long festoon of moss it wa veri dark there onli in
place where a bough wa broken the moonlight lai in white gule upon
the ground anoth wall and anoth gate and suddenli the litter wa
set down it curtain open torch flash women appear clad in
white robe veil and mysteri who bow befor him then half led
and half lift him from hi litter he could feel their ey on him
through their veil but he could not see their face he could see

shrank from the quaint carv portal which he saw befor him he did
not wish to pass it it aspect fill him with reluct the women
drew him on their hand pull at hi arm their shoulder press him
from behind still he hung back look about him till to hi delight

studi the wall to seek a spot in them that could be climb if
necessari and found none
so thei return to the room which had been swept and garnish in
their absenc no sooner had thei enter it than the door open and
through it came long line of asiki priest each of whom stagger
beneath the weight of a hide bag that he bore upon hi shoulder which

as my spirit ha been here from the first oh i see you think i lie to
you come then come and i will show you those who from the begin
have been the husband of the asika and rise from her chair she took
him by the hand
thei went through door and by long halflit passag till thei came to
great gate guard by old priest arm with spear as thei drew
near to these priest the asika loos a scarf that she wore over her
breastplat of gold fish scale and threw the starspangl thing over
alan head that even these priest should not see hi face then she
spoke a word to them and thei open the gate here jeeki evinc
a disposit to remain remark to hi master that he thought that
place into which he had never enter much too holi for poor nigger
like him
the asika ask him what he had said and he explain hi sens of
unworthi in her own tongu
come fellow she exclaim to translat my word and to bear
wit that no trick is plai upon your lord
still jeeki linger bashfulli whereon at a sign from her on of the
priest prick him behind with hi great spear and utter a low howl
he sprang forward
the asika led the wai down a passag which thei saw end in a big hall
lit with lamp now thei were in it and alan becam awar that thei had
enter the treasur hous of the asiki sinc here were pile up great
heap of gold gold in ingot gold in nugget in stone jar fill
with dust in vessel plain or emboss with monstrou shape in
fetish and in littl squar and disc that look as though thei had
serv as coin never had he seen so much gold befor
you ar rich here ladi he said gaze at the pile astonish
she shrug her shoulder ye as i have heard that some peopl count
wealth these ar the offer brought to our god from the begin
also all the gold found in the mountain belong to the god and there
is much of it there the gift i sent to you wa taken from thi heap
but in truth it is but a poor gift see that although thi stuff is
bright and serv for cup and other thing it ha no us at all and
is onli offer to the god becaus it is harder to come by than other
metal look these ar prettier than the gold and from a stone tabl
she pick up at hazard a long necklac of larg uncut stone red and
white in colour and set altern that alan judg to be crystal
and spinel
take it she said and examin it at your leisur it is veri old
for hundr of year no more of these necklac have been made and
with a careless movement she threw the chain over hi head so that it
hung upon hi shoulder
alan thank her then rememb that the man call mungana who wa
the husband real or offici of thi priestess had been somewhat
similarli adorn and shiver a littl as though at a presag of
advanc fate still he did not return the thing fear lest he
should give offenc
at thi moment hi attent wa taken from the treasur by the sound
of a groan behind him turn round he perceiv jeeki hi great ey
roll as though in an extrem of fear
oh my golli major he ejacul point to the wall look there
alan look but at first in that dim light could onli discov long
row of gleam object which reach from the floor to the roof
come and see said the asika and take a lamp from that tabl on
which lai the gem she led him past the pile of gold to on side of
the vault or hall then he saw and although he did not show it like
jeeki he wa afraid
for there each in hi own nich and stand on abov the other were
what look like hundr of golden men with gleam ey at first
until the utter still undeceiv him he thought that thei must be
men then he understood that thi wa what thei had been now thei were
corps wrap in sheet of thin gold and wear golden mask with
ey of crystal each mask be beaten out to a hideou represent
of the man in life
all these ar the husband of my spirit said the priestess wave
the lamp in front of the lowest row of them mungana who were marri
to the asika in the past look here is he who said that he ought to
be king of that rich land where year after year the river overflow it
bank and go to on of the first of the figur in the bottom row
she drew out a fasten and suffer the gold mask to fall forward on a
hing expos the face within
although it had evid been treat with some preserv thi head
now wa littl more than a skull still cover with dark hair but set
upon it brow appear an object that alan recogn at onc a simpl
band of plain gold and rise from it the head of an asp without doubt
it wa the uraeu that symbol which onli the royalti of old egypt
dare to wear without doubt also either thi man had brought it with
him from the nile or in memori of hi rank and home he had fashion it
of the gold that wa so plenti in the place of hi captiv so thi
woman stori wa true an ancient egyptian had onc been husband to the
asika of hi dai
meanwhil hi guid had pass a long wai down the line and halt in
front of anoth goldwrap figur open it mask
thi is that man she said who told us he came from a land call
roma look the helmet still rest upon hi head though time ha eaten
into it and that ring upon your hand wa taken from hi finger i have
a headdress made upon the model of that helmet which i wear sometim
in memori of thi man who my soul rememb wa brave and pleasant and
a gallant lover
inde answer alan look at the sunken face abov which a rim of
curl appear beneath the rust helmet well he doesnt look veri
gallant now doe he then he peer down between the bodi and it gold
case and saw that in hi bodi hand the man still held a short roman
sword lift as though in salut so she had not li in thi matter
either
meanwhil the asika had glide on to the end of the hall behind the
heap of treasur
there is on more white man she said though we know littl of him
for he wa fierc and barbar and di without learn our tongu
after kill a great number of the priest of that dai becaus thei
would not let him go ye di cut them down with a battleax and
sing some wild song of hi own countri come hither slave and bend
yourself so rest your hand upon the ground
jeeki obei and activ as a cat the priestess leap on to hi
back and reach up open the mask of a corps in the second row and
held her lamp befor it face
it wa better preserv than the other so that it featur remain
compar perfect and about them hung a tangl of golden hair
moreov a broad battleax appear rest on the shoulder
a vike thought alan i wonder how he came here
when he had look the asika leap from jeeki back to the ground
and wave her arm around her began to talk so rapidli that alan could
understand noth of her word and ask jeeki to translat them
she sai explain jeeki between hi chatter teeth that all
rest these johnni veri poor crew nativ and that lot except on who
worship fals prophet and cut throat of asika of that time becaus she
infidel and he teach her better also eat hi dinner out of littl bonsa
and chuck her into water veri wild man that arab but priest catch
him at last and fill him with hot gold befor littl bonsa becaus he no
care a damn for ghost so he die sai hip hip hurrah for houri and
green field of prophet and to hell with asika and bonsa big and littl
now he sit up there and at night time worst ghost of all the crowd
alwai come to finish off mungana that all she sai and quit enough
too come on quick she want you and no like wait
by now the asika had pass almost round the hall and wa stand
opposit to an empti nich beyond and abov which there were perhap a
score of bodi goldplat in the usual fashion
that is your place vernoon she said gentli contempl him with
her soft and heavi ey for it wa prepar for the white man with
whom littl bonsa fled awai and sinc then as you see there have been
mani mungana some of whom belong to me inde that on and she
touch a corps on which the gold look veri fresh onli left me last
year but we alwai knew that littl bonsa would bring you back again
and so you see we have kept your place empti
inde remark alan that is veri kind of you and feel that he
would faint if he stai longer in thi horribl and haunt vault he
push past her with littl ceremoni and walk out through the gate
into the passag beyond
chapter xii
the gold hous
how you like asikiland major ask jeeki who had follow him
and wa now lean against a wall fan himself feebli with hi great
hand funni place isnt it major i tell you so befor you come but
you no believ me
veri funni answer alan so funni that i want to get out
ah major that what eel sai in trap where he go after lobworm but he

cooki mean asika she onli stop shut up those stiff un who all love
lobworm on dai veri pretti woman asika but thank god she not set
cap at me who like to be buri in open like christian man
if you dont stop it jeeki repli alan in a concentr rage
ill see that you ar buri just where you ar
no offenc major no offenc my heart full and bubbl up i wonder
what miss barbara sai if she see you moo and coo with darkei
girl in gold snake skin
just then the asika arriv and by wai of excus for hi flight alan
remark to her that the treasurehal wa hot
i did not notic it she answer but he who is call my husband
mungana sai the same the mungana is guardian of the dead she
explain and when he is requir so to do he sleep in the place of
the treasur and gather wisdom from the spirit of those mungana who
were befor him
inde and doe he like that bedchamb
the mungana like what i like not what he like she repli
haughtili where i send him to sleep there he sleep but come
vernoon and i will show you the holi water where big bonsa dwell also
the hous in which i have my home where you shall visit me when you
pleas
who built thi place ask alan as she led him through more dark and
tortuou passag it is veri great
my spirit doe not rememb when it wa built vernoon so old is it
but i think that the asiki were onc a big and famou peopl who trade
to the water upon the west and even to the water on the east and that
wa how those white men becam their slave and the mungana of their
queen now thei ar small and live onli by the might and fame of big
and littl bonsa not half fill the rich land which is their but
she ad reflect and look at him i think also that thi is
becaus in the past fool have been thrust upon my spirit as mungana
what it need is the wisdom of the white man such wisdom as your
vernoon if that were ad to my magic then the asiki would grow great
again see that thei have in such plenti the gold which you have
shown me the white man love ye thei would grow great and from coast
to coast the peopl should bow at the name of bonsa and send him their
son for sacrific perhap you will live to see that dai vernoon
slave she ad address jeeki set the mask upon your lord
head for we come where women ar
alan object but she stamp her foot and said it must be so have
onc worn littl bonsa as her peopl told her he had done hi nake
face might not be seen so alan submit to the hideou headdress and
thei enter the asika hous by some back entranc
it wa a place with mani room in it but thei were all remark for
extrem simplic with a singl except no gild or gold wa to
be seen although the food vessel were made of thi materi here as
everywher the chamber includ those in which the asika live and
slept were panel or rather board with cedar wood that wa almost
black with ag and their scanti furnitur wa mostli made of eboni
thei were veri insuffici light like hi own room by mean of
bar open set high in the wall inde gloom and mysteri were
the keynot of thi place amongst the shadow of which handsom
halfnak servant or priestess flit to and fro at their task
or peer at them out of dark corner the atmospher seem heavi
with secret sin alan felt that in those room unnam crime and
cruelti had been commit for hundr or perhap thousand of year
and that the place wa yet haunt by the ghost of them at ani rate it
struck a chill to hi healthi blood more even than had that hall of the
dead and of heapedup golden treasur
doe my hous pleas you the asika ask of him
not altogeth he answer i think it is dark
from the begin my spirit ha ever love the dark vernoon i think
that it wa shape in some black midnight
thei pass through the chief entranc of the hous which had pillar of
woodwork grotesqu carv down some step into a wall and roofedin
yard where the shadow were even more dens than in the hous thei had
left onli at on spot wa there light flow down through a hole in
the roof as it did appar in that hall where alan had found the
asika sit in state the light fell on to a pedest or column made
of gold which wa place behind an object like a larg saxon font
also made of gold the shape of thi column remind alan of someth
name of a veri similar column although fashion of a differ
materi which stood in the granitebuilt offic of messr aylward
haswel in the citi of london nor did thi seem wonder to him sinc
on top of it squat on it dwarf leg stood a horrid but familiar
thing name littl bonsa herself come home at last there she sat
smile cruelli as she had smile from the begin forget
doubtless of her wander in strang land while round her stood a
band of priest arm with spear
follow by the asika and jeeki alan walk up and look her in
the face and to hi excit imagin she appear to grin at him in
answer then while the priest prostrat themselv he examin the
golden basin or laver and saw that at the further side of it wa a
littl platform approach by step on the top of these golden step
were two depress such as might have been worn out in the cours of
ag by person kneel there also the flat edg of the basin which
stood about thirti inch abov the level of the topmost step wa
score as though by hundr of sword cut which had made deep line in
the pure metal the basin itself wa empti
see that these thing interest him the asika volunt the
inform through jeeki that thi wa a diviningbowl and that if
those who went befor her had wish to learn the futur thei caus
littl bonsa to float in it and found out all thei want to know by
her movement she howev she ad had other and better method of
learn thing that were predestin
where doe the water come from ask alan thoughtlessli search the
bowl for some tap or inlet
out of the heart of men she answer with a low and dread laugh
these mark ar those of sword and everi on of them mean a life
then see that he look incredul she ad stai i will show
you littl bonsa must be thirsti who ha fast so long also there
ar matter that i desir to know come hithery and you and she
point at hazard to the two priest who knelt nearest to her and do
you bid the execution bring hi ax she went on to a third
the dark face of the men turn ashen but thei made no effort to
escap their doom on of them crept up the step and laid hi neck upon
the edg of gold while the other utter no word threw himself on
hi face at the foot of them wait hi turn then a door open and
there appear a great and brutallook fellow nake except for a
loin cloth who bore in hi hand a huge weapon half knife and half ax
first he look at the asika who nod almost impercept then
sprang on to a prolong of the golden step bow to littl bonsa
on her column behind and heav up hi knife
now for the first time alan realli understood what wa about to happen
and that what he had imagin a stage rehears wa to becom a hideou
murder
stop he shout in english be unabl to rememb the nativ word
the execution paus with hi ax pois in midair the victim turn
hi head and look as though surpris the second victim and the
priest their companion look also jeeki fell on to hi knee and
burst into fervent prayer address appar to littl bonsa the
asika smile and did noth
again the weapon wa lift and as he felt that word were no longer
of ani us even if he could find them alan took refug in action
spring on to the other side of the littl platform he hit out with
all hi strength across the kneel man catch the execution on
the point of the chin he knock him straight backward in such fashion
that hi head struck upon the floor befor ani other portion of hi
bodi so that he lai there either dead or stun alan never learn
which sinc the matter wa not thought of suffici import to be
mention
at thi sight the asika burst into a low laugh then ask alan why he
had fell the execution he answer becaus he would not stand by
and see two innoc men butcher
why not she said in an astonish voic if littl bonsa whose
priest thei ar need them and i who am the mouth of the god
declar that thei should die still she ha been in your keep for a
long while and you mai know her will so if you wish it let them live
or perhap you requir other victim and she fix her ey upon
jeeki with a glanc of suggest hope
oh my golli gasp jeeki in english tell her not for joe major
tell her most improp sai yellow god my dearest friend and go mad as
hatter if my throat cut

i choos no victim he broke in nor will i see man blood shedto
me it is orundaunholi i mai not look on human blood and if you
caus me to do so asika i shall hate you becaus you make me break my
oath
the asika reflect for a moment while jeeki behind mutter between
hi chatter teeth
good missionari talk that major keep up word in season major if
she make christian martyr of jeeki who get you out of thi confound
hole
then the asika spoke
be it as you will for i desir neither that you should hate me nor
that you should look on that which is unlaw for your ey to see the
feast and ceremoni you must attend but if i can help it no victim
shall be slain in your presenc not even that whimper hound your
servant she ad with a contemptu glanc at jeeki who it seem
fear to give hi life for the glori of the god but who becaus he is
your is safe now and alwai
that veri satisfactori said jeeki rise from hi knee hi face
wreath in smile for he knew well that a decre of the asika could
not be broken then he began to explain to the priestess that it wa not
fear of lose hi own life that had move him but the certainti that
thi occurr would disagre moral with littl bonsa whose entir
confid he possess
take no notic of hi word with a slight rever to the fetish
she pass on beckon to alan as he went by the two prostrat
priest whose live he had save lift their head a littl and look
at him with heartfelt gratitud in their ey inde on of them kiss

chapter xiii
the feast of littl bonsa
it wa the night of full moon and of the great feast of the return of
littl bonsa alan sat in hi chamber wait to be summon to take
part in thi ceremoni and listen the while to that wow wow wow
of the death drum whereof jeeki had onc spoken in england which
could be clearli heard even abov the perpetu boom of the cataract
tumbl down it cliff behind the town by now he had recov from
the fatigu of hi journei and hi health wa good but the same could
not be said of hi spirit for never in hi life had he felt more
downheart not even when he wa sicken for blackwat fever or lai
in bondag in the citi expect everi morn to wake up and find hi
reput blast he wa a prison in thi dread gloomi
place where he must live like a second man in the iron mask without
recreat or exercis other than he could find in the wall garden
where grew the black cedar tree and so far as he could see a
prison without hope of escap
moreov he could no longer disguis from himself the truth jeeki wa
right the asika had fallen in love with him or at ani rate made up her
mind that he should be her next husband he hate the sight of the woman
and her sinuou evil beauti but to be free of her wa imposs and
to offend her death all dai long she kept him about her and from hi
sleep he would wake up and as on the night of hi arriv
distinguish her lean over him studi hi face by the light of
the faintlyburn lamp as a snake studi the bird it is about to
strike he dare not stir or give the slightest sign that he saw her
nor inde did he alwai see her for he kept hi ey close shut
but even in hi heaviest slumber some warn sens told him of her
presenc and then abov jeeki snore for on these occas jeeki
alwai snore hi loudest he would hear a soft footfal as catlik
she crept toward him or the sweep of her spangl robe or the
tinkl of the scale of her golden breastplat for a long while
she would stand there examin him greedili and even the few littl
belong that remain to him and then with a hungri sigh glide awai

grew the shriek individu fell exhaust and were thrown into the
water where thei sank or float awai on the slow move stream as part
of some inexplic plai that wa be enact
then suddenli the asika stood still and threw up her arm and thei fell
upon their face and lai as though thei were dead a third time she
threw up her arm and thei rose and remain so silent that the onli
sound to be heard wa that of their thick breath then she spoke or
rather scream sai

stream face and held it on high then she lower it to the level
of her breast and hold it in both hand walk to the edg of
the dai whereon priest disguis as fiend began to leap at it
strive to reach it with their finger and snatch it from her grasp
on by on thei leapt with the most desper energi each man be
allow to make three attempt and alan note that thi novel jump
competit wa watch with the deepest interest by all the audienc
at the time he knew not why
the first two were evid elderli men who fail to come anywher
near the mark their failur wa receiv with shout of deris thei
sank exhaust to the ground and from the motion of hi bodi alan could
see that on of them wa weep while the other remain sullenli
silent then a younger man advanc and at the third try almost grasp

idea of hi makeup be that of a skeleton he wa a thin activ
fellow and all the watch thousand greet him with a shout for
a few second he stood back gaze at the mask as a wolf might at an

air such an amaz jump alan had never seen befor so high wa
it inde that hi head came level with that of the fetish which he
snatch with both hand tear it from asika grasp come to the
ground again with a thud he began to caper to and fro kiss the
mask while the audienc shout

the man stop hi caper and held the mouth of littl bonsa to hi
ear nod from time to time as though she were speak to him and he
heard what she said then he pass round the dai where alan could not

thi man drain it to the dreg and with an exclam of rage dash
the empti vessel into the face of the chosen priest with such furi that

he who had drunk first began to spring about in a ludicr fashion and
present wa join in hi danc by the other two so absurd were their
motion and tumbl and clownlik grimac for thei had drag off
their mask that roar of brutal laughter rose from the audienc in
which the asika join
at first alan thought that the thing wa a joke and that the men had
mere been made mad drunk till catch sight of their ey in
the moonlight he perceiv that thei were in great pain and turn
indignantli to remonstr with the asika
be silent vernoon she said savag blood is your orunda and
i respect it therefor by decre of the god these die of poison and
again she fell to laugh at the contort of the victim

fascin he open them onc more it wa to see that the three poor
creatur had thrown themselv into the water where thei roll over
and over like wound porpois till present thei sank and vanish

speak clear the audienc have laugh itself hoars set itself to
watch the proceed of the newli chosen highpriest of littl bonsa
who by now had recov from the blow dealt to him by on of the
murder men with the help of some other priest he wa engag in
bind the fetish on to a littl raft of reed thi done he laid
himself flat upon a broad plank which had been made readi for him at

few stroke of hi feet that hung over the side of the plank paddl
himself out to the centr of the canal where the god call big bonsa
float or wa anchor have reach it he push the littl raft
off the plank into the water and in some wai that alan could not see
made it fast to big bonsa so that now the two of them float on
behind the other then while the peopl cheer shout out that
husband and wife had come togeth again at last he paddl hi plank
back to the water edg sat down and wait
meanwhil at a sign from the asika all the score of priest and
priestess who were dress as devil had file off to right and left
and vanish presum to cross the water by bridg or boat that
were out of sight at ani rate now thei began to appear upon it further
side and to wind their wai singli among the thousand of the asiki
peopl who were gather upon the rocki slope beyond in order to wit

into the water and slowli float back to it station direct by some
agenc or power that alan could not discov
at the touch of the fetish the man scream like a hors in pain or
terror and soldier leap on him with a savag shout drag him up

and her ey glitter as she said the word still she ad note
the fall in hi face if it is gold that thei need you shall send it

and there it can be put in a big cano and carri across the water see
to the pack of the stuff you black dog she said to jeeki over her
shoulder and when it is readi i will send it henc
alan began to thank her though he thought it more than probabl that
even if she kept her word thi bullion would never get to old calabar
and much less to england but she waiv the matter asid as on in
which she wa not interest
tell me she ask would you have me other than i am first do you
think me beauti
ye answer alan honestli veri beauti when you ar quiet as
now not when you ar danc as you did the other night without your
robe
when she understood what he meant the asika actual blush a littl
i am sorri she answer in a voic that for her wa quit humbl i
forget that it might seem strang in your ey it ha alwai been
the custom for the asika to do as i did at feast and sacrific but
perhap that is not the fashion among your women perhap thei alwai
remain veil as i have heard the worshipp of the prophet do and
therefor you thought me immodest i am veri veri sorri vernoon i
prai you to forgiv me who am ignor and onli do what i have been
taught
ye thei alwai remain veil stammer alan though he wa not
refer to their face and as the word pass hi lip he wonder
what the asika would think if she could see a ballet at a london
musichal
is there anyth els wrong she went on gentli if so tell me that
i mai set it right
i do not like cruelti or sacrific o asika i have told you that
bloodsh is orunda to me and at the feast those men were poison
and you mock them in their pain also mani other were taken awai to
be kill for no crime
she open her beauti ey and stare at him answer
but vernoon all thi is not my fault thei were sacrific to the
god and if i did not sacrific i should be sacrif by the priest
and wizard who live to sacrific ye myself i should be made to drink
the poison and be mock at while i di like a snake with a broken
back or even if i escap the vengeanc of the peopl the god
themselv would kill me and rais up anoth in my place do thei not
sacrific in your countri vernoon
no asika thei fight if necessari and kill those who commit murder
but thei have no fetish that ask for blood and the law thei have from
heaven is a law of merci
she stare at him again
all thi is strang to me she said i wa taught otherwis god ar
devil and must be appeas lest thei bring misfortun on us men must
be rule by terror or thei would rebel and pull down the great hous
doctor must learn magic or how could thei avert spell wizard must
be kill or the peopl would perish in their net mai not we who live
in a hell strive to beat back it flame with the wisdom our forefath
have hand on to us tell me vernoon for i would know
you make your own hell answer alan when with the help of jeeki he
understood her talk
she ponder over hi word for a while then said
i must think the thing is big i wander in black i will speak
with you again sai now what els is wrong with me
now alan thought that he saw opportun for a word in season and made a
great mistak
i think that you treat your husband that man whom you call mungana
veri badli why should you drive him to hi death
at these word the asika leapt up in a rage and seek someth to
vent her temper on violent box jeeki ear and kick him with
her sandal foot
the mungana she exclaim that beast what have i to do with him
i hate him as i hate the other the priest thrust him on me he ha
had hi dai let him go in your countri do thei make women live with
men whom thei loath i love you bonsa himself know why perhap
becaus you have a white skin and white thought but i hate that man
what is the us of be asika if i cannot take what i love and reject
what i hate go awai vernoon go awai you have anger me and if it
were not for what you have said about that new law of merci i think
that i would cut your throat and again she box jeeki ear and
kick him in the shin
alan rose and bow himself toward the door while she stood with her
back toward him sob as he wa about to pass it she wheel round
wipe the tear from her ey with her hand and said
i forgot i sent for you to thank you for your present that and she
point to the lion skin which thei tell me you kill with some kind
of thunder to save the life of that old cannib and thi and she
pull off the necklac of claw then ad as i am too bad to wear
it you had better take it back again and she threw it with all her
strength straight into jeeki face
fear wors thing the much maltreat jeeki utter a howl and
bolt through the door while alan pick up the necklac return
it to her with a bow she took it
stop she said you ar leav the room without your mask and my
women ar outsid come here and she ti the thing upon hi head

thi mess while she wa a beauti savag devil on could deal with
the thing but if she is go to becom human it is anoth matter
jeeki look at him with piti in hi ey
alwai thought white man mad at bottom he said shake hi big head

love and cut when you get chanc then she pleas as punch everyth
go smooth and jeeki get no more kick christian religion busi veri
good but wont wash in asikiland your reverend uncl find out that
not wish to pursu the argument alan chang the subject by ask
hi indign retain if he thought that the asika had meant what she
said when she offer to send the gold down to the coast
why not major that good ladi alwai mean what she sai and what she
do too and he dab wrathfulli at the scratch made by the lion
claw on hi face then ad she know her own mind not like
shillysh seesaw white woman who get up on thing and go to bed
anoth if she love she love if she hate she hate if she sai she
send gold she send it though piti to part with all that cash becaus
spect someon bag it
alan reflect a while
dont you see jeeki that here is a chanc if a veri small on of
get a messag to the coast also it is quit clear that if we ar
ever abl to escap it will be imposs for us to carri thi heavi
stuff wherea if we send it on ahead perhap some of it might get
through we will pack it up jeeki at ani rate it will be someth to
do go now and send a messag to the asika and ask her to let us have
some carpent and a lot of wellseason wood
the messag wa sent and an hour later a dozen of the nativ craftsmen
arriv with their rude tool and a suppli of plank cut from a kind of
ironwood or eboni tree thei prostrat themselv to alan then the
master of them rise instantli began to measur jeeki with a mark
reed that worthi sprang back and ask what in the name of bonsa big
and littl thei were do whereon the man explain with humil
that the asika had said that she thought the white lord want the
wood to make a box to buri hi servant in as he the said servant had
offend her that morn and doubtless the white lord wish to kill
him on that account or perhap to put him awai under ground aliv
oh my golli said jeeki shake till hi great knee knock
togeth oh my golli here pretti go she think you want buri me all
aliv that mean she want to be rid of jeeki becaus he got sit there
and plai gooseberri when she wish talk alon with you oh ye i see
her littl game
well jeeki said alan burst into such a roar of laughter that he
nearli shook off hi mask you had better be care for you just told
me that the asika is not like a seesaw white woman and never chang
her mind sai to thi man that he must tell the asika there is a
mistak and that howev much i should like to oblig her i cant buri
you becaus it ha been prophesi to me that on the dai you ar buri
i shall be buri also and that therefor you must be kept aliv
capit notion that major said jeeki much reliev she not want
buri you just at present next year perhap but not now i tell him
and he did with much vigour
thi slight misconcept have been dispos of thei explain to the
carpent what wa want first all the gold wa empti out of the
sack in which it remain as the priest had brought it and divid
into heap each of which weigh about forti pound a weight that
with it box alan consid would be a good load for a porter of these
heap there prove to be fiftythre their total valu alan reckon
amount to about 100000 sterl then the carpent were set to
work to make a model box which thei did quickli enough and with great
ingenu cut the wood with their nativ saw dovetail it as
a civil craftsman would do and final secur it everywher with
eboni peg driven into hole which thei bore with a hot iron the
result wa a box that would stand ani amount of rough usag and when
final peg down on that could onli be open with a hammer and a
cold chisel
thi boxmak went on for two whole dai as each of them wa fill
and peg down the gold within be pack in sawdust to keep it from
rattl alan amus himself in ad an address with a feather brush
and a suppli of red paint such as the asiki priest us to decor
their bodi at first he wa puzzl to know what address to put but
final decid upon the follow
major a vernon care of miss champer the court near kingswel
england ad in the corner from a v asiki land africa
it wa all childish enough he knew yet when it wa done he regard
hi handiwork with a sort of satisfact for reflect alan if but
on of those box should chanc to get through to england it would
tell barbara a great deal and if it were address to himself her
uncl could scarc dare to take possess of it
then he bethought him of send a letter but wa oblig to abandon
the idea as he had neither pen pencil ink nor paper left to him
whatev art remain to them that of ani form of write wa now
total unknown to the asiki although mark that might be write it
will be rememb did appear on the inner side of the littl bonsa
mask an evid of it great antiqu even in the dai when thei had
wrap up the egyptian the roman and other earli mungana in sheet
of gold and set them in their treasurehous appar thei had no
knowledg of it for not even an hieroglyph or a rune appear upon
the imperish metal shroud sinc that time thei had evid
decreas not advanc in learn till at the present dai except for
these relic and some dim and meaningless surviv of rite that onc
had been religi and were still offer to the same ancient idol
there wa littl to distinguish them from other tribe of central
african savag still alan did someth for obtain a piec of
white wood which he smooth as well as he wa abl with a knife he
paint on it thi messag

as it happen just as alan wa finish thi scrawl with a sad heart
he heard a movement and glanc up perceiv stand at hi side
the asika of whom he had seen noth sinc the interview when she had
beaten jeeki
what ar those mark that you make upon the board vernoon she ask
suspici
with the assist of jeeki who kept at a respect distanc he
inform her that thei were a messag in write to tell the white men
at the coast to forward the gold to hi starv famili
oh she said i never heard of write you shall teach it me it
will serv to pass the time till we ar marri though it will not
be of much us afterward as we shall never be separ ani more and
word ar better than mark upon a board but she ad cheerfulli i
can send awai thi black dog of your and she look at jeeki and
he can write to us no i cannot for an accid might happen to him
and thei tell me you sai that if he di you die also so he must stop

more sinc you valu that stuff well anoth time you shall send all
you want meanwhil the porter ar wait fifti men and three as you
sent me word and ten spare on to take the place of ani who die but
how thei will find their wai i know not sinc none of them have ever
been to the coast
an idea occur to alan who had small faith in jeeki ma as a
messeng
the ogula prison could show them he said at ani rate as far as
the forest and after that thei could find out mai thei not go asika
if you will she answer carelessli let them be readi to start
tomorrow at the dawn all except their chief fahni who must stop
here as a hostag i do not trust those ogula who more than onc have
threaten to make war upon us she ad then turn and bade the
priest bring in the bearer to receiv their instruct
present thei came pick men all of them under the command of an
asiki captain and with them the ogula whom she summon also
go where the white lord send you she said in an indiffer voic
carri with you these packag i do not know where it is but
these maneat will show you some of the wai and if you fail in the
busi but live to come back again you shall be sacrif to bonsa
at the next feast if you run awai then your wive and children will be
sacrif food shall be given you for your journei and gold to bui
more when it is gone now vernoon tell them what thei have to do
so alan or rather jeeki told them and these direct were so
long and minut that befor thei were finish the asika grew tire
of listen and went awai sai as she pass the captain of the
compani
rememb my word man succe or die but of your land and it
secret sai noth
i hear answer the captain prostrat himself
that night alan summon the ogula and spoke to them through jeeki in
their own languag at first thei declar that thei would not leav
their chief prefer to stai and die with him
not so said fahni go my children that i mai live go and gather
the tribe all the thousand of them who ar men and can fight and
bring them up to attack asikiland to rescu me if i still live or to
aveng me if i am dead as for these bearer do them no harm but send
them on to the coast with the white man good
so in the end the ogula said that thei would go and when alan woke
up on the follow morn he wa inform that thei and the asiki
porter had alreadi depart upon their journei then he dismiss the
matter from hi mind for to tell the truth he never expect to hear of
them ani more
chapter xv

after the departur of the messeng a deep melancholi fell upon alan
who wa sure that he had now no further hope of commun with the
outsid world bitterli did he reproach himself for hi folli in have
ever journei to thi hate place in order to securewhat about
100000 worth of gold which of cours he never could secur as it
would certainli vanish or be stolen on it wai to the coast for thi
gold he had becom involv in a dread complic which must cost
him much miseri and sooner or later life itself sinc he could not
marri that beauti savag asika and if he refus her she would
certainli kill him in her outrag pride and furi
dai by dai she sent for him and when he came assum a new charact
that of a woman humbl by a sens of her own ignor which she wa
anxiou to amend so he must plai the role of tutor to her tell her
of civil peopl their law custom and religion and instruct
her how to write and read she listen and learn submiss enough
but all the while alan felt as on might who is call upon to teach
trick to a drug panther the drug in thi case wa her passion for
him which appear to be veri genuin but when it pass off or when
he wa oblig to refus her what he wonder would happen then
anxieti and confin told on him far more than all the hardship of
hi journei hi health ran down he began to fall ill then as bad luck

time to time he wa talk with barbara which even then he knew must
be absurd for how could thei talk across thousand of mile of land and
sea

find himself ly in the hall or room where he had alwai been feel
quit cool and without pain but so weak that it wa an effort to him to

thi novel interpret of a sacr doctrin worthi of jeeki
himself so paralyz alan enfeebl brain that he could make no
answer nor do anyth except wonder what would happen in asikiland
when the decre of it priestess took effect then jeeki arriv
with someth to drink which he swallow with the eager of the
convalesc and almost immedi went to sleep in good earnest
alan recoveri wa rapid sinc as the asika had told him if a patient
live through it the kind of fever that he had taken did not last long
enough to exhaust hi vital forc when she ask him if he need
anyth to make him well he answer
ye air and exercis
she repli that he should have both and next morn hi hate mask
wa put upon hi face and he wa support by priest to a door where a
litter or rather litter were wait on for himself and anoth
for jeeki who although in robust health wa still suppos to be
offici ill and not allow to walk upon hi own leg thei enter
these litter and were born off till present thei met a third litter
of particularli gorgeou design carri by mask bearer wherein wa
the asika herself wear her coronet and a splendid robe
into thi litter which wa fit with a second seat alan wa
transfer the mungana for whom it wa design be place in that
vacat by alan which either by accid or otherwis wa no more seen
that dai thei went up the mountain side and to the edg of the great
fall and watch the water thunder down though the crest of them
thei could not reach next thei wander off into the huge forest that
cloth the slope of the hill and there halt and at then as the
sun sank thei return to the gloomi bonsatown beneath them
for alan notwithstand hi weak and anxieti it wa a heavenli
dai the asika wa passiv some new mood be on her and scarc
troubl him at all except to call hi attent to a tree a flower or
a prospect of the sceneri here on the mountain side too the air wa
sweet and for the restwel he who had been so near to death wa
escap for an hour from that gloomi home of bloodsh and superstit
and saw god sky again
thi journei wa the first of mani everi dai the litter were wait

dug a littl in thi gravel not without reward for in it thei found
sever nugget abov too where thei went afterward wa a huge
quartz reef denud by water which evid had been work in past

turn to see her stand in a corner of the great room hold a lamp
in her hand and look toward him her gold breastplat and crown were

robe of pure white fit with a kind of nun hood which lai back upon
her shoulder also on her arm she carri a shawl or veil stand
thu all undeck with her long hair fasten in a simpl knot she
still look veri beauti more so than she had ever been thought
alan for the cruelti of her face had fade and wa replac by a
mysteri veri strang to see she did not seem quit like a natur

felt attract by her hitherto she had alwai repel him but thi

stretch out hi hand and bow almost to the ground
then thei start and follow mani long passag as befor although
whether thei were the same or other alan could not tell came at last
to a door which he recogn that of the treasur hous as thei
approach thi door it open and through it like a hunt thing ran
the bedizen mungana husband of the asika terror or mad shine
in hi ey catch sight of hi wife who bore the lamp he threw
himself upon hi knee and snatch at her robe address some
petit to her speak so rapidli that alan could not follow hi
word
for a moment she listen then drag her dress from hi hand and
spurn him with her foot there wa someth so cruel in the gestur
and the action so full of deadli hate and loath that alan who
wit it experienc a new revuls of feel toward the
asika what kind of a woman must she be he wonder who could treat a
discard lover thu in the presenc of hi successor
with a groan or a sob it wa difficult to sai which the poor man rose
and perceiv alan whose face he now beheld for the first time sinc
the asika had told him not to mask himself as thei would meet no on
the sight of it seem to fill him with jealou furi at ani rate he
leapt at hi rival intend appar to catch him by the throat
alan who wa watch him step asid so that he came into violent
contact with the wall of the passag and halfstun by the shock
reel onward into the dark
the hog said the asika or rather she hiss it the hog who dare
to touch me and to strike at you well hi time is shortwould that i
could make it shorter did you hear what he sought of me
alan who wish for no confid repli by ask what the mungana
wa do in the treasur hous to which she answer that the spirit
who dwelt there were eat up hi soul and when thei had devour it
all he would go quit mad and kill himself
doe thi happen to all mungana inquir alan
ye vernoon if the asika hate them but if she love them it is
otherwis come let us forget the wretch who would kill you if he
could and she led the wai into the hall and up it pass between the
heap of gold
on the tabl where lai the necklac of gem she set down her lamp
whereof the light all there wa in that great place flicker feebli
upon the mask of littl bonsa which had been move here appar for
some ceremoni purpos and still more feebli upon the hideou golden
counten and wind sheet of the ancient yellow dead who stood
around in score place on abov the other each in hi appoint
nich it wa an awesom scene and on that oppress jeeki veri much
for he murmur to alan
oh my major famili vault child plai to thi hole just like
here hi comparison came to an end for the asika cut it short with a
singl glanc
sit here in front of me she said to alan and you jeeki sit at
your lord side and be silent till i bid you speak
then she crouch down in a heap behind them threw the cloth or veil
she carri over her head and in some wai that thei did not see
suddenli extinguish the lamp
now thei were in deep dark the dark of death and in utter
silenc the silenc of the dead no glimmer of light and yet to alan
it seem as though he could feel the flash of the crystal ey of
littl bonsa and of all the other ey set in the mask of those
depart men who onc had been the husband of the bloodstain
priestess of the asiki till on by on as she weari of them thei
were bewitch to mad and to doom in that utter quiet he thought
even that he could hear them stir within their wind sheet or it mai
have been that the asika had risen and move among them on some errand
of her own far awai someth fell to the floor a veri light object
such as flake of rock or a scale of gold yet the nois of it struck hi
nerv loud as a clap of thunder and those of jeeki also for he felt
him start at hi side and heard the sudden hammerlik beat of hi heart
what wa the woman do in thi dread place he wonder well
it wa easi to guess doubtless she had brought them here to scare and
impress them present a voic that of some hidden priest would speak
to them and thei would be ask to believ it a messag from the spirit
world or a spirit itself might be arrangedwhat could be easier in
their mood and these surround
now the asika wa speak behind them in a muffl voic from the tone
of it she appear to be engag in argument or supplic in some
strang tongu at ani rate alan could not understand a word of what she
said the argument or prayer went on for a long while with paus
as though for answer then suddenli it ceas and onc more thei were
plung into that unfathom silenc
chapter xvi
what the asika show alan
it seem to alan that he went to sleep and dream
he dream that it wa late autumn in england leav drift down from
the tree beneath the breath of a strong damp wind and ran or float
along the road till thei vanish into a ditch or caught against a pile
of stone that had been laid readi for it repair he knew the road well

the crest of a hill it wa that which ran from mr champershaswel
splendid hous the court to the church he could see them both the
hous to the right the church to the left and hi eyesight seem to
have improv sinc he wa abl to observ that at either place there

now the big gate of the court open and through them came a funer
it advanc toward him with unnatur swift as though it float
upon air the whole melancholi process of it in a few second it had

first carriag he saw barbara seat look sad and somewhat troubl
but well a littl further down the line came anoth carriag and in
it wa sir robert aylward stare befor him with cold impass face
in hi dream alan thought to himself that he must have borrow thi
carriag which would not be strang as he gener us motor
for there wa a peer coronet upon the panel and the silvermount
har
the funer pass and suddenli vanish into the churchyard gate
leav alan wonder why hi cousin haswel wa not seat at
barbara side then it occur to him that it might be becaus he wa
in the coffin and at that moment in hi dream he heard the asika ask

countri call england

fierc be silent slave for now the power of the good brood upon

the dream went on a great forest appear such a forest as thei had
pass befor thei met the cannib and set beneath on of the tree
a tent and in that tent barbara barbara weep someon began to lift
the flap of the tent she sprang up snatch at a pistol that lai
besid her turn it muzzl toward her breast a man enter the
tent alan saw hi face it wa hi own barbara let fall the pistol
and fell backward as though a bullet from it had pierc her heart he
leapt toward her but befor he came to where she lai everyth had
vanish and he heard jeeki drone out hi li to the asika tell
her that the vision he had seen wa on of her and hi master seat
with their arm about each other in a chamber of the golden hous
a third time the dream descend on alan like a cloud it seem to him
that he wa born beyond the flame border of the world everyth
around wa new and unfamiliar vast chang love terribl he
stood alon upon a pearli plain and the sky abov him wa lit with red
moon mani and mani of them that hung there like lamp spirit began
to pass him he could catch someth of their splendour as thei sped
by with incred swift he could hear the music of their laughter
on rose up at hi side it wa the asika onli a thousand time more
splendid cloth in all the glori of hell majest she bent
toward him her glow ey held hi the deadli perfum of her breath
beat upon hi brow and made him drunken
she spoke to him and her voic sound like distant bell
through mani a life through mani a life she said bought with much
blood paid for with a million tear but mine at last the soul that i
have won to comfort my soul in the etern dai come to the place i have
made readi for you the hell that shall turn to heaven at your step
come you by whom i am redeem and drive awai those god that tortur
me becaus i wa their servant that i might win you
so she spoke and though all hi soul revolt yet the fear strength
that wa in her seem to draw him onward whither she would go then a
light shone and that light wa the face of barbara and with a sudden
that wa almost aw the wild dream came to an end
alan wa in hi own room again though how he got there he did not
recollect
jeeki he said what ha happen i seem to have had a veri curiou
dream there in the treasureplac and to have heard you tell the
asika a string of incred falsehood
oh no major jeeki cant lie too good christian he tell her what
he see or what he think she see if she look caus though prap
he see noth she never believ that and he ad with a burst of
confid what the dicken it matter what he tell her so long as she

leav it all to jeeki
fifteen more dai had gone by and it wa the ev of the night of the
second full moon when alan wa destin to becom the husband of the
asika she had sent for him that morn and he found her radiant with
happi whether or no she believ jeeki interpret of the
vision she had call up it seem quit certain that her mind wa
void of fear and doubt she wa sure that alan wa about to becom her
husband and had summon all the peopl of the asiki to be present at
the ceremoni of their marriag and incident of the death of the
mungana who poor wretch wa to be forc to kill himself upon that
occas
befor thei part she had spoken to alan sweetli enough
vernoon she said i know that you do not love me as i love you but
the love will come sinc for your sake i will chang myself i will
grow gentl i will shed no more blood that of the mungana shall be the
last and even him i would spare if i could onli while he live i mai
not marri you it is the on law that is stronger than i am and if
i broke it i and you would die at onc you shall even teach me your
faith if you will for what is good to you is henceforth good to me
ask what you wish of me and as an earnest i will do it if i can
now alan look at her there wa on thing that he wish abov all
othersthat she would let him go but thi he did not dare to ask
moreov it would have been utterli useless after all if the asika
love wa terribl what would be the appear of her outrag hate
what could he ask more gold he hate the veri name of the stuff for
it had brought him here he rememb the old cannib chief fahni
who like himself languish a prison daili expect death onli
that morn he had implor him to obtain hi liberti
i thank you asika he said now if your word ar true set fahni
free and let him return to hi own countri for if he stai here he will
die
sure vernoon that is a small thing she answer smile though
it is true that when he get there he will probabl make war upon
us well let him let him then she clap her hand and summon
priest whom she bade go at onc and conduct fahni out of bonsatown
also she bade them loos certain slave who were of the ogula tribe
that thei might accompani him laden with provis and send on order
to the outpost that fahni and hi parti should pass unmolest from the
land
thi done she began to talk to alan about mani matter howev littl
he might answer her inde it seem almost as though she fear to let
him leav her side as though some presenti of loss oppress her
at length to alan great relief the time came when thei must
part sinc it wa necessari for her to attend a secret ceremoni of
prepar or purif that wa call puttingoffthepast
although she had been thrice summon still she would not let him go
thei call you asika said alan
ye ye thei call me she repli spring up leav me vernoon
till we meet tomorrow to part no more oh why is my heart so heavi in
me that black dog of your read the vision that i summon but might
not look on and thei were good vision thei show that the woman
who love you is dead thei show us wed and other deeper thing
sure he would not dare to lie to me know that if he did i would
flai him live and throw him to the vultur why then is my heart
so heavi in me would you escap me vernoon nai you ar not so cruel
nor could you do it except by death moreov man know that even in
death you cannot escap me for there be sure i shall follow you and
claim you to whose side my spirit ha toil for ag and what is
there so strong that it can snatch you from my hand
she look at him a moment and seiz hi hand burst into a flood of
tear and seiz hi hand threw herself upon her knee and kiss it
again and again
go now she said go and let my love go with you through live and
death and all the dream beyond oh let my love go with you as it
shall vernoon
so he went leav her weep on her knee
dure the dark hour that follow alan and mad were not far apart
what could he do escap wa utterli imposs for week he and jeeki
had consid it in vain even if thei could win out of the gold hous
fortress what hope had thei of make their wai through the crowd
tortuou town where after the african fashion peopl walk about all
night everi on of whom would recogn the white man whether he were
mask or no besid beyond the town were the river and the guard
wall and gate and beyond them open countri where thei would be cut off
or run down no to attempt escap wa suicid suicid that gave him
an idea why should he not kill himself it would be easi enough for
he still had hi revolv and a few cartridg and sure it wa
better than to enter on such a life as await him as the playth of a
priestess of a tribe of fetishworship savag
but if he kill himself how about barbara and how about poor old
jeeki who would certainli be kill also besid it wa not the
right thing to do and while there is life there is alwai hope
alan paus in hi walk up and down the room and look at jeeki
who sat upon the floor with hi back rest against the stone altar
reflect pull down hi thick underlip and let it fly back
negrofashion
jeeki he said time up what am i to do
do major he repli with affect cheer oh that quit
simpl jeeki arrang everyth you marri asika and by and by when
you master here and tire of her you give her slip veri interest
experi no white man ever have such luck befor asika not half bad
if she fond of you she like littl girl in song when she good
she veri veri good at ani rate noth els to do marri asika or
spiflic which mean major that jeeki spiflic too and he
ad shake hi white head sadli he no like that on or two
littl thing on hi mind that no get time to squar up yet darent
prai like christian here caus afraid of bonsa and bonsa come even
with him by and by caus he been christian so poor jeeki fall down
bump between two stool postl kick him out of heaven and bonsa kick
him out of hell and where jeeki go to then
dont know i am sure answer alan smile a littl in spite of hi
sorrow but i think the bonsa might find a corner for you somewher
look here jeeki you old scamp i am sorri for you for you have been
a good friend to me and we ar fond of each other but just understand
thi i am not go to marri that woman if i can help it it against
my principl so i shall wait till tomorrow and then i shall walk out
of thi place if the guard try to stop me i shall shoot them while i
have ani cartridg then i shall go on until thei kill me
oh but major thei not kill younev thei chuck blanket over your
head and take you back to asika it jeeki thei kill skin him aliveo
and all the rest of it
hope not jeeki becaus thei think we shall die the same dai but if
so i cant help it tomorrow morn i shall walk out and now that
settl i am tire and go to sleep and he threw himself down upon
the bed and be worn out with weari and anxieti soon fell fast
asleep
but jeeki did not sleep although he too lai down upon hi bed on the
contrari he remain wide awak and reflect more deepli perhap
than he had ever done befor be sure the superstit as to the
depend of alan life upon hi own wa now worn veri thin and that
hi hour wa at hand he thought of make alan wild attempt to
depart imposs by the simpl method of warn the asika but
notwithstand hi nativ selfish wa too loyal to let that idea
take root in hi mind no there wa noth to be done if the major
wish to start the major must start and he jeeki must pai the
price well he deserv it who had been fool enough to listen to the
secret prompt of littl bonsa and conduct him to asikiland
thu he pass sever hour for the most part in melancholi
specul as to the exact fashion of hi end until at length
weari overcam him also and shut hi ey jeeki began to
doze suddenli he grew awar of the presenc of some other person in
the room but think that it wa onli the asika prowl about in her
uncanni fashion or perhap her spirit for how her bodi enter the
place he could not guess he did not stir but lai breath heavili and
watch out of the corner of hi ey
present a figur emerg from the shadow into the faint light thrown
by the singl lamp that burn abov and though it wa wrap in
a dark cloak jeeki knew at onc that it wa not the asika veri
stealthili the figur crept toward him as a leopard might creep
and bent down to examin him the movement caus the cloak to slip
a littl and for an instant jeeki caught sight of the wast
halfcraz face of the mungana and of a long curv knife that
glitter in hi hand paralyz with fear he lai quit still know
that should he show the slightest sign of conscious that knife would
pierc hi heart
the mungana watch him a while then satisfi that he slept
turn round and bend himself almost doubl glide with infinit
precaut toward alan bed which stood some twelv or fourteen
feet awai silent as a snake that uncoil itself jeeki slip from
between hi blanket and crept after him hi nake feet make no nois
upon the matstrewn floor so intent wa the mungana upon the deed which
he had come to do that he never look back and thu it happen that
the two of them reach the bed on immedi behind the other
alan wa ly on hi back with hi throat expos a veri easi victim
for a moment the mungana stare then he erect himself like a snake
about to strike and lift the great curv knife take aim at alan
nake breast jeeki erect himself also and even as the knife began
to fall with on hand he caught the arm that drove it and with the
other the murder throat the mungana fought like a wildcat but
jeeki wa too strong for him hi finger held the man windpip like
a vise he choke and weaken the knife fell from hi hand he sank to
the ground and lai there helpless whereon jeeki knelt upon hi chest
and possess himself of the knife held it within an inch of hi
heart
it wa at thi junctur that alan woke up and ask sleepili what wa
the matter
noth major answer jeeki in low and cheer tone snake
just go to bite you and i catch him that all and he gave an extra
squeez to the mungana throat who turn black in the face and roll
hi ey
be care jeeki or you will kill the man exclaim alan
recogn the mungana and take in the situat
why not major he want kill you and me too afterward good riddanc
of bad rubbish as book sai
i am not so sure jeeki give him air and let me think tell him that
if he make ani nois he di
jeeki obei and the mungana darken ey grew bright again as he
drew hi breath in great sob
now friend said alan in asiki why did you wish to stab me
becaus i hate you answer the man who tomorrow will take my
place and the wife i love
as a year or two ago you took someon els place eh well suppos
now that i dont want either your place or your wife
what would that matter even it if were true white man sinc she want

i am think friend that there is someon els she will want when
she hear of thi how do you suppos that you will die tomorrow not
so easili as you hope perhap
the mungana ey seem to sink into hi head and hi face to sicken
with terror that shaft had gone home
suppos i make a bargain with you went on alan slowli suppos
i sai mungana show me the wai out of thi place as you can now at
onc or if you prefer it refus and be given up to the asika come
you ar not too mad to understand answerand quickli
would you kill me afterward he ask
not i why should i wish to kill you you can come with us and go where
you will or you can stai here and die as the asika direct
i cannot believ you white man it is not possibl that you should
wish to run awai from so much love and glori or to spare on who
would have slain you also it would be difficult to get you out of
bonsatown
jeeki said alan thi fellow is mad after all i think you had
better go to the door and shout for the priest
no no lord beg the wretch creatur i will trust you i will
try though it is you who must be mad
veri good stand over him jeeki while i put on my thing and ye
give me that mask if he stir kill him at onc
so alan made himself readi then he mount guard over the mungana as
did jeeki although he shook hi head over their prospect of escap
no go he mutter no go if we get past priest asika catch us
with her magic when i bolt with your reverend uncl last time littl
bonsa arrang busi becaus she go abroad fetch you now like as

alan sternli bade him be quiet and stop behind if he did not wish to
come

all two compani major now all readi march and he gave the
unfortun mungana a fear kick as a hint to proce
so utterli crush wa the poor wretch that even thi insult did not
stir him to resent
follow me white man he said and if you desir to live be silent
throw your cloak about your head
thei did so and hold their revolv in their right hand glide
after the mungana in the corner of the big room thei came to a littl
stair how it open in that place where no stair had been thei could
not see or even guess for it wa too dark onli now thei knew the mean
by which the asika had been abl to visit them at night
the mungana went first down the stair jeeki follow grasp him by
the arm with on hand while in the other he kept hi own knife readi
to stab him at the first sign of treacheri alan brought up the rear
keep hold of jeeki cloak thei pass down twelv step of stair
then turn to the right along a tunnel then to the left then to the
right again in the pitch dark it wa an aw journei sinc thei
knew not whither thei were be led and expect that everi moment
would be their last at length quit of a sudden thei emerg into
moonlight
alan look about him and knew the place it wa where the feast had
been held two month befor when the priest were poison and the
bonsa chose the victim for sacrific alreadi it wa prepar for the
great festiv of tomorrow when the mungana should drown himself and
alan be marri to the asika there on the dai were the gold chair in
which thei were to sit and green branch of tree mix with curiou
flag deck the vast amphitheatr beyond moreov there wa the broad
canal and float in the midst of it the hideou gold fetish big
bonsa the moon shone on it glare deathli ey it fishlik snout
and it huge pale teeth alan look at it and shiver for the thing
wa horrid and uncanni and the utter loneli in which it lai stare
up at the moon seem to accentu the horror
the mungana notic hi fear and whisper
we must swim the water if you have a god white man prai him to
protect you from bonsa
lead on answer alan i do not dread a foul fetish onli the look
of it but is there no wai round
the mungana shook hi head and began to enter the canal jeeki whose
teeth were chatter hung back but alan push him from behind so
sharpli that he stumbl and made a splash then alan follow and as
the cold black water rose to hi chest look again at big bonsa
it seem to him that the thing had turn round and wa stare at
them sure a few second ago it snout point the other wai no that
must be fanci he wa swim now thei were all swim alan and
jeeki hold their pistol and littl stock of cartridg abov
their head to keep them dry the gold head of big bonsa appear to be
lift itself up in the water as a reptil might in order to get a
better view of these proceed but doubtless it wa the rippl that
thei caus which gave it thi appear onli why did the rippl make
it come toward them quit gentli like an investig fish
it wa about ten yard off and thei were in the middl of the canal the
mungana had pass it it wa in a line with alan head oh heaven a
sudden smother of foam a rush like that of a torpedo and set low down
between two curv wave a flash of gold then a gurgl inhuman
laugh and a weight upon hi back down went alan down and down
chapter xvii
the end of the mungana
the moonlight abov vanish alan wa alon in the depth with thi
devil or whatev it might be he could feel hand and feet grip
and tread on him but thei did not seem to be human for there were
too mani of them also thei were veri cold he gave himself up for dead
and thought of barbara
then someth flash into hi mind in hi hand he still held the
revolv he press it upward against the thing that wa smother
him and pull the trigger again he pull it and again for it wa a
selfcock weapon and even there deep down in the water he heard the
thud of the explos of the dampproof copper cartridg hi lung
were burst hi sens reel onli enough of them remain to tell
him that he wa free of that strangl grip and float upward hi
head rose abov the surfac and through the mouth of hi mask he drew
in the sweet air with quick gasp down below him in the clear water
he saw the yellow head of big bonsa rock and quiver like a great
reflect moon saw too that it wa begin to rise yet he could not
swim awai from it the fetish seem to have hypnot him he heard
jeeki call to him from the shallow water near the further bank but
still he float there like a log and stare down at big bonsa wallow
beneath
jeeki plung back into the canal and with a few strong stroke reach
him grip him by the arm and began to tow him to the shore befor
thei came there big bonsa rose like a huge fish and tri to follow
them but could not or so it seem at ani rate it onli whirl round
and round upon the surfac while from it pour a white fluid that
turn the black water to the hue of milk then it began to scream
make a thin and dread sound more like that of an infant in pain
than anyth thei had ever heard a veri sicken sound that alan
never could forget he stagger to the bank and stood stare at it
where it bled roll and shriek but becaus of the milki foam could
make noth out in that light
what is it jeeki he said with an idiot laugh what is it
oh dont know devil and all perhap come on major befor it catch
us
i dont think it will catch anyon just at present devil or not
hollownos bullet dont agre with it shall i give it anoth
jeeki and he lift the pistol
no no major dont plai tomfool and jeeki grab him by the arm
and drag him awai
a few pace further on stood the mungana like a man transfix and even
then alan notic that he regard him with someth akin to aw
stronger than the god he mutter stronger than the god and
bound forward
follow the path that ran besid the canal thei plung into a
tunnel hold each other as befor in a few minut thei were through
it and in a place full of cedar tree outsid the wall of the gold
hous under which evid the tunnel pass for there it rose behind
them beneath these cedar tree thei flit like ghost now in the
moonlight and now in the shadow
the great fall to the back of the town wa on their left and in front
of them lai on of the arm of the river at thi spot a rage
torrent not much more than a hundr feet in width span by a narrow
suspens bridg which seem to be support by two fibr rope on
the hither side of thi bridg stood a guard hut and to their dismai
out of thi hut ran three men arm with spear evid to cut them
off on of these men sped across the bridg and took hi stand at the
further end while the other two post themselv in their path at the
entranc to it
the mungana slack hi speed and said on wordfinish and jeeki
also hesit then turn and point behind them
alan look back and flit in and out between the cedar tree saw
the white robe of the priest of bonsa then despair seiz them all
and thei rush at the bridg jeeki reach it first and dodg
beneath the spear of the two guard plung hi knife into the breast
of on of them and but the other with hi great head so that he
fell over the side of the bridg on to the rock below
cut major cut he said to alan who push past him all right
now
thei were on the narrow swai bridgeit wa but a singl plankalan
first then the mungana then jeeki when thei were half wai across
alan look befor him and saw a sight he could never forget
the third guard at the further side wa saw through on of the fibr
rope with hi spear there thei were on the middl of the bridg with
the torrent rave fifti feet beneath them and the man had nearli
sever the rope to get over befor it part wa imposs behind
were the priest beneath the roar river all three of them stop
as though paralyz for all three had seen someth struck against
alan leg it wa hi pistol that still remain fasten to hi wrist
by it leather thong he cock and lift it took aim and fire
the shot miss which wa not wonder consid the light and the
platform on which the shooter stood it miss but the man astonish
for he had never seen or heard such a thing befor stop hi saw
for a moment and stare at them then as he began again alan fire onc
more and thi time by good fortun the bullet struck the man somewher
in the bodi he fell and as he fell grasp the nearli separ rope
and hung to it
get hold of the other rope and come on yell alan and onc more
thei bound forward
my god it go he yell again hold fast jeeki hold fast
next instant the rope part and the man vanish the bridg tip
over and support by the remain rope hung edgewai up to thi
rope the three of them clung desper rest their feet upon the
edg of the swai plank for a few second thei remain thu afraid
to stir then jeeki call out
climb on major climb on like on monkei look bad but quit safe
realli
as there wa noth els to be done alan began to climb shift hi
feet along the plank edg and hi hand along the rope which creak
and stretch beneath their threefold weight
it wa a horribl journei and in hi imagin took at least an hour
yet thei accomplish it for at last thei found themselv huddl
togeth but safe upon the further bank the sweat pour down from
hi head almost blind alan a deadli nausea work within him sickli
tremor shot up and down hi spine hi brain swam yet he could hear
jeeki in whom excit alwai took the form of speech sai
loudli
think that man no liar what sai our great papa wa monkei never look
down on monkei no more wake up major those priest monkeymen too
for we all brother you know wait a bit i stop their littl game
and spring up with three or four cut of the big curv knife he
sever the remain rope just as their pursuer reach the further
side of the chasm
thei shout with rage as the long bridg swung back against the rock
the cut end of it fall into the torrent and wave their spear
threateningli to thi demonstr jeeki repli with gestur
of contempt such as ar known to street arab then he look at the
mungana who lai upon the ground a melancholi and dilapid spectacl
for the perspir had wash line of paint off hi face and patch
of dye from hi hair also hi gorgeou robe were waterstain and
hi gem necklac broken have studi him a while jeeki kick
him medit till he got up then ask him to set out the exact
situat the mungana answer that thei were safe for a while sinc
that torrent could onli be cross by the broken bridg and wa too
rapid to swim the asiki he ad must go a long journei round through
the citi in order to come at them though doubtless thei would hunt them
down in time
here jeeki cut him short sinc he knew all that countri well and
onli wish to learn whether ani more bridg had been built across the
torrent sinc he wa a boi
now major he said you get up and follow me for i know everi inch
of ground also by and by good short cut over mountain you see
jeeki veri clever boi and when he herd sheep and goat he made note of
everyth and never forget noth he pull you out of thi hole never
fear
glad to hear it i am sure answer alan as he rose but what to
becom of the mungana
dont know and dont care said jeeki no more good to us can go
and see how big bonsa feel if he like and stretch out hi big hand
as though in a moment of abstract he remov the costli necklac
from their guid neck and thrust them into the pouch he wore also he
pick up the gild linen mask which alan had remov from hi head and
place it in the same receptacl remark that he alwai taught that
it wick to wast anyth when so mani poor in the world
then thei start the mungana follow them jeeki paus and wave
him off but the poor wretch still came on whereon jeeki produc the
big crook knife mungana own knife
what ar you go to do said alan awak to the situat
cut off head of that cocktail man major and so save him lot of
troubl also we got no grub and if we find ani he want eat a lot chop
what do for two prap make veri short common for three also he might
plai dirti trick so much best dead

just so major that helloswello want cut our throat so i want cut
hison good turn deserv anoth as wise king sai in book when
he give half babi to woman what wouldnt have it well so be major

you mean that he will run awai jeeki
oh no he not run awai he in too blue funk for that but someth
run awai with him becaus he ought die tomorrow night oh ye you
see you see and jeeki hope that someth not run awai with you too
major becaus you ought be marri at same time
hope not i am sure answer alan and bethink him of big bonsa
wallow and scream on the water and bleed out white blood he
shiver a littl
by thi time advanc at a trot the mungana run after them like a
dog thei had enter the bush pierc with a few wander path along
these path thei sped for hour after hour jeeki lead them without
a moment hesit thei met no man and heard noth except
occasion weird sound which alan put down to wild beast but jeeki
and the mungana said were produc by ghost inde it appear that
all thi jungl wa suppos to be haunt and no asiki would enter it
at night or unless he were veri bold and protect by mani charm by
dai either therefor it wa an excel place for fugit who sore
need a good start
at length the dai began to dawn just as thei reach the main road where
it cross the hill whenc on hi journei thither alan had hi first
view of bonsa town peer from the edg of the bush thei perceiv a
fire burn near the road and round it five or six men who seem
to be asleep their first thought wa to avoid them but the mungana
creep up to alan for jeeki he would not approach whisper
not asiki ogula chief and slave who left bonsa town yesterdai
thei crept nearer the fire and saw that thi wa so then rejoic
exceedingli thei awok the old chief fahni who at first thought thei
must be spirit but when he recogn alan he flung himself on hi
knee and kiss hi hand becaus to him he ow hi liberti
no time for all that fahni said alan give us food
now of thi as it chanc there wa plenti sinc by the asika order
the slave had been laden with as much as thei could carri thei at of
it raven and while thei at told fahni someth of the stori of
their escap the old chief listen amaz but like jeeki ask alan
why he had not kill the mungana who would have kill him
alan who wa in no mood for long explan answer that he had
kept him with them becaus he might be us
ye ye friend i see exclaim the old cannib although he is
so thin he will alwai make a meal or two at a pinch truli white men
ar wise and provid like the ant you take thought for the morrow
as soon as thei had swallow their food thei start all togeth for
although alan point out to fahni that he might be safer apart the old
chief who had a real affect for him would not be persuad to leav
him
let us live or die togeth he said
now jeeki abandon the main road led them up a stream walk in
the water so that their footstep might leav no trace and thu awai
into the barren mountain which rose between them and the great swamp
on the crest of these mountain alan turn and look back toward
bonsa town there far across the fertil vallei wa the hate
riverencircl place there fell the great cataract in the roar of
which he had live for so mani week there were the black cedar and
there gleam the roof of the gold hous hi prison where dwelt the
asika and the dread fetish of which she wa the priestess to him
it wa like the vision of a nightmar he could scarc think it real
and yet by thi time doubtless thei sought him far and wide what mood
he wonder would the asika be in when she learn of hi escap and
the fashion of it and how would she greet him if he were recaptur and
taken back to her well he would not be recaptur he had still some
cartridg and he would fight till thei kill him or fail that
save the last of them for himself never never could he endur to be
drag back to bonsa town there to live and die
thei went on across the mountain till in the afternoon onc more thei
saw the road run beneath them like a ribbon and at the end of it
the lagoon now thei rest a while and held a consult while thei
at across that lagoon thei could not escap without a cano
lord said the mungana present yesterdai when these cannib
were let go a swift runner wa sent forward command that a good boat
should be provis and made readi for them and by now doubtless thi
ha been done let them descend to the road walk on to the bai and ask
for the boat look yonder far awai a tongu of land cover with tree
jut out into the lake we will make our wai thither and after nightfal
thi chief can row back to it and take us into the cano
alan said that the plan wa good but jeeki shook hi head ask what
would happen if fahni find himself safe upon the water thought it
wisest not to come to fetch them
alan translat hi word to the old chief whereon fahni want to
fight jeeki becaus of the slur that he had cast upon hi honour thi
challeng jeeki resolut declin sai that alreadi there were
plenti of wai to die in asikiland without ad anoth to them then
fahni swore by hi tribal god and by the spirit of everi man he had
ever eaten that he would come to that promontori after dark if he were
still aliv
so thei separ fahni and hi men slip down to the road which
thei did without be seen by anyon while alan jeeki and the
mungana bore awai to the right toward the promontori the road wa long
and rough and though by good fortun thei met no on sinc the few who
dwelt in these wild part had gone up to bonsa town to be present at
the great feast the sun wa sink befor ever thei reach the place
moreov thi promontori prove to be cover with dens thorn scrub
through which thei must forc a wai in the gather dark not
without hurt and difficulti still thei accomplish it and at length
quit exhaust crept to the veri point where thei hid themselv
between some stone at the water edg
here thei wait for three long hour but no boat came
all up a gumtre now major said jeeki old blackguard fanni
bolt and leav us here and tomorrow morn asika nobbl us better
have gone down to bai steal hi boat and leav him behind becaus
asika no want him
alan made no answer he wa too tire and although he trust fahni it
seem like enough that jeeki wa right or perhap the cannib had
not been abl to get the boat well he had done hi best and if fate
overtook them it wa no fault of hi he began to doze for even their
immin peril could not keep hi ey open then present awok with
a start for in hi sleep he thought he heard the sound of paddl
beat the quiet water ye there dimli seen through the mist wa a
cano and seat in the stern of it fahni so that danger had gone by
also
he woke hi companion who slept at hi side and veri silent thei
rose step from rock to rock till thei reach the cano and enter
it it wa not a larg craft bare big enough to hold them all inde
but thei found room and then at a sign from fahni the oarsmen gave wai
so heartili that within half an hour thei had lost sight of the accurs
shore of asikiland although present it mountain show up clearli
beneath the moon
meanwhil fahni had told hi tale it appear that when he reach the
bai he found the asiki headman who dwelt there and those under him in
a state of consider excit
rumour had reach them that someon had escap from bonsa town thei
thought it wa the mungana fahni ask who had brought the rumour
whereon the headman answer that it came in a dream and would sai no
more then he demand the cano which had been promis to him and hi
peopl and the headman admit that it wa readi in accord with
order receiv from the asika but demur to let him have it a
long argument follow in the midst of which fahni and hi men got into
the cano the headman appar not dare to us forc to prevent
him just as thei were push off a messeng arriv from bonsa town
reel with exhaust and hi tongu hang from hi jaw who call
out that it wa the white man who had escap with hi servant and the
mungana and that although thei were believ to be still hidden in the
holi wood near bonsa town none were to be allow to leav the bai so
the headman shout to fahni to return but he pretend not to hear
and row awai nor did anyon attempt to follow him still it wa onli
after nightfal that he dare to put the boat about and return to the
headland to pick up alan and the other as he had promis that wa all
he had to sai
alan thank him heartili for hi faith and thei paddl on
steadili put mile after mile of water between them and asikiland
he wonder whether he had seen the last of that countri and it
inhabit someth within him answer no he wa sure that the
asika would not allow him to depart in peac without make some
desper effort to recaptur him far as he wa awai it seem to him
that he could feel her furi hang over him like a cloud a cloud that
would burst in a rain of blood doubtless it would have burst alreadi
had it not been for the accid that he and hi companion were still
suppos to be hide in the wood but that error must be discov
and then would come the pursuit
he look at the full moon shine upon him and reflect that at thi
veri hour he should have been seat upon the chair of state wed
or rather be wed by the asika in the presenc of big and littl
bonsa and all the peopl hi ey fell upon the mungana who had also
been destin to plai a promin part in that ceremoni at onc he saw
that there wa someth wrong with the man a curiou chang had come
over hi emaci face it wa work like that of a maniac foam
appear upon hi dy lip hi haunt ey roll hi thin hand
grip the side of the cano and he began to sing or rather howl like
a dog bai at the star jeeki hit him on the head and bade him be
silent but he took no notic even when he hit him again more heavili
present came the climax the man sprang up in the cano caus it
to rock from side to side he point to the full moon abov and howl
more loudli than befor he point to someth that he seem to see
in the air near by and gibber as though in terror then hi ey fix
themselv upon the water at which he stare
harder and harder he stare hi head sink lower everi moment till
at length without anoth sound veri quietli and unexpectedli he
went over the side of the boat for a few second thei saw hi
brightcolour garment sink to the depth then he vanish
thei wait a while expect that he would rise again but he never
rose a shotweight corps could not have disappear more final and
complet the thing wa veri aw and for a while there wa silenc
which as usual wa broken by jeeki
that gai dog gone he said in a reflect voic all those old
ghost come to fetch him at proper time no good run awai from ghost
thei travel too quick on jump and pop up where you no expect well
more place for jeeki now and he spread himself out comfort in the
empti seat ad like helloswello room much better than compani
he go in scentbath everi dai and stink too much all that water never
wash him clean
thu di the mungana and such wa the poor wretch requiem with
a shiver alan reflect that had it not been for him and hi insan
jealousi he too might have been expect to go into that same
scentbath and have hi face paint like a choru girl onli would he
escap the spell that had destroi hi predecessor in the affect of
the priestess of the bonsa or would some dim power such as had drawn
mungana to the death drag him back to the arm of the asika or to the
tortur pit of great swim head he rememb hi dream in the
treasur hall and shudder at the veri thought of it for all he had
undergon and seen made him superstiti then bade the men paddl
faster ever faster
all that night thei row on take turn to rest except alan and
jeeki who slept a good deal and as a consequ awok at dawn much
refresh when the sun rose thei found themselv across the lagoon
over thirti mile from the border of asikiland almost at the spot
where the river up which thei had travel some month befor
flow out of the lake whether by chanc or skill fahni had steer a
wonderfulli straight cours now howev thei were face to face with a
new troubl for scarc had thei begun to descend the river when thei
discov that at thi dry season of the year it wa in mani place
too shallow to allow the cano to pass over the sand and mud bank
evid there wa but on thing to be doneabandon it and walk
so thei land at from their store of food and began a terribl and
toilsom journei on either side of the river lai dessic swamp
cover with dead reed ten or twelv feet high doubtless beyond the
swamp there wa high land but in order to reach thi if it exist
thei would be oblig to forc a path through mile of reed therefor
thei thought it safer to follow the river bank their progress wa veri
slow sinc continu thei must make detour to avoid a quicksand or
a creek also the stone and scrubbi growth delai them so that fifteen
or at most twenti mile wa a good dai march
still thei went on steadili see no man and when their food wa
exhaust live on the fish which thei caught in plenti in the
shallow and on young flapper duck that haunt the reed so at
length thei came to the main river into which thi tributari flow and
camp there thankfulli believ that if ani pursuit of them had been
undertaken it wa abandon at least alan and the rest believ thi
but jeeki did not
on the follow morn shortli after dawn jeeki awok hi master
come here major he said in a solemn voic i got someth pretti
show you and he led him to the foot of an old willow tree ad
now up you go major and look
so alan went up and from the topmost fork of that tree saw a sight at
which hi blood turn cold for there not five mile behind them
on either side of the river bank the light gleam on their spear
march two endless column of men who from their headdress he
took to be asiki for a minut he look then descend the tree and
approach the other ask what wa to be done
hook scoot bolt leg it exclaim jeeki emphat then he
lick hi finger held it up to the wind and ad but first fire
reed and make it hot for bonsa crowd
thi wa a good suggest and on on which thei act without delai
take red ember thei blew them into a flame and lit torch which
thei appli to the reed over a width of sever hundr yard the
strong northward wind soon did the rest inde with a quarter of an
hour a vast sheet of flame twenti or thirti feet in height wa rush
toward the asiki column then thei began their advanc along the river
bank run at a steadi trot for here the ground wa open
all that dai thei ran paus at interv to get their breath and at
night rest becaus thei must when the light came upon the follow
morn thei look back from a littl hill and saw the outpost of the
asiki advanc not a mile behind doubtless some of the armi had been
burn but the rest guess their rout had forc a wai through
the reed and cut across countri so thei began to run again harder than
befor and kept their lead dure the morn but when afternoon came
the asika gain on them now thei were breast a long rise the river
run in the cleft beneath and jeeki who seem to be absolut
untir held alan by the hand fahni follow close behind two of
their men had fallen down and been abandon and the rest straggl
no go jeeki gasp alan thei will catch us at the top of the
hill
never sai die major never sai die puf jeeki thei get blown
too and who know what other side of hill
somehow thei struggl to the crest and behold there beneath them wa a
great armi of men
ogula yell jeeki ogula just what i tell you major who know
what other side of ani hill
chapter xviii
a meet in the forest
in five minut more alan and jeeki were among the ogula who have
recogn their chief while he wa yet some wai off greet him with
raptur cheer and the clap of hand then as there wa no time
for explan thei retreat across a littl stream which ran down
the vallei four thousand or more of them and prepar for battl that
even howev there wa no fight for when the first of the asiki
reach the top of the rise and saw that the fugit had escap to
the enemi who were in strength thei halt and final retir
now alan and fahni also hope that the pursuit wa abandon but
again jeeki shook hi big head sai

do so priest make anoth asika and kill her when thei catch her
after thi a council of war wa held and it wa decid to camp there
that night sinc the posit wa good to meet an attack if on should
be made and the ogula were afraid of be caught on the march with
their back toward the enemi alan wa glad enough to hear thi
decis for he wa quit worn out and readi to take ani risk for a
few hour rest at thi council he learn also that the asiki bearer
carri hi gold with their ogula guid had arriv safe among
the ogula who had muster in answer to their chief call and were
advanc toward asikiland though the busi wa on that did not
pleas them as for these asiki bearer it seem that thei had gone on
into the forest with the gold and noth more had been heard of them
as thei were leav the council alan ask jeeki if he had ani tide

freed by the asika to guid the bearer roll over and over on the
ground watch by a curiou crowd just as he arriv jeeki who

hi companion while the other involv in the charg kept themselv
out of sight whether jeeki ma wa or wa not eaten by the ogula no

alan wa sleep heavili when a sound of rush feet and of strang
thrill battlecri awok him he sprang up snatch at a spear and
shield which jeeki had provid for him and ran out to find from the
posit of the moon that dawn wa near
come on major said jeeki asiki make night attack thei alwai

by the time that he reach the first rank which were some wai off
the worst of the attack wa over it had been short and sharp for the
asiki had hope to find the ogula unprepar and to take their camp with
a rush but the ogula who knew their habit were wait for them
so that present thei withdrew carri off their wound and leav
about fifti dead upon the ground as soon as he wa quit sure that the
enemi were all gone jeeki arm with a larg battleax went off to
inspect these fallen soldier alan who wa help the ogula wound
wonder why he took so much interest in them half an hour later hi
curios wa satisfi for jeeki return with over twenti heavi gold
ring torqu and bracelet slung over hi shoulder
where did you get those jeeki he ask

yard awai
we alwai dislik each other vernon but i must sai that i never

an unarm man in an african forest oh dont wast breath in ly i
saw you recogn me aim and fire after which jeeki would have had
the other barrel and who then would have remain to tell the stori
lord aylward
aylward made no answer but alan felt that if wish could kill him he
would not live long hi ey fell upon a long unmistak mound of
fresh earth beneath a tree he calcul it length and with a thrill
of terror notic that it wa too small for a negro
who is buri there he ask

dont be afraid lord aylward i shall find out everyth in time
the convers between jeeki and the nativ proceed their head
were close togeth it grew anim thei seem to be come to some
decis present on of them ran and cut the lash of the man who
had been bound to the tree and he stagger toward them and join
in the talk point to hi wound then the two fellow who had been

with him rush at them and began stab them with spear and strike
them with stick in three minut it wa over without anoth shot
be fire most of them were despatch and the other throw down

now shout in jubil some of the men began to drag awai the dead
bodi while other collect the rifl and the remaind head by
jeeki advanc toward alan and aylward wave their red spear alan
stood stare for he did not in the least understand the mean of

there wa the pale barbara seat weep there again as he enter
she sprang up and snatch the pistol that lai besid her turn it

alan hold her hand while befor them stood aylward like a prison
in the dock and behind him the arm jeeki
tell me the stori barbara said alan and tell it briefli for i
cannot bear much more of thi

after you had gone dear thing went on as usual for a month or two
then came the great sahara compani troubl first there were rumour

left me hi fortun but made lord aylward there my truste until i came
to the full ag of twentyf under my father will alan dont forc
me to tell you what sort of a guardian he wa to me also there wa no

alan with it i came to find you
alan lord aylward follow me although everybodi els wa ruin he
remain rich veri veri rich thei sai and hi fanci wa to marri me
also i think it wa not comfort for him in england it is a long
tale but i got up here with about fiveandtwenti servant and snell

dread fever and had it not been for those good black peopl i should
have di for i have been veri sick alan but thei nurs me and i
recov it wa poor snell who di thei buri her a few dai ago
i thought that she would live but she had a relaps next lord aylward

run awai nowoh you can guess you can guess he want my peopl to
carri me awai somewher to the coast i suppos but thei were faith
to me and would not then he set hi soldier on to maltreat them thei
shot sever of them and flog them on everi opportun thei were
flog on of them just now i heard them well the poor men made me
understand that thei could bear it no longer and must do what he told
them
and so alan as i wa quit hopeless and helpless i made up my mind
to kill myself hope that god would forgiv me and that i should find
you somewher perhap after sleep a while for it wa better to
die than to be given into the powerof that man i thought that he wa
come for me just now and i wa about to do it but it wa you instead
alan you and onli just in time that is all the stori and i hope
you will not think that i have act veri foolishli but i did it for
the best if you onli knew what i have suffer alan what i have gone
through in on wai and anoth i am sure that you would not judg me
harshli also i kept dream that you were in troubl and want me to
come to you and of cours i knew where you were gone and had that map
send him awai alan for i am still so weak and i cannot bear the sight
of hi face if you knew everyth you would understand
alan turn on aylward and in a cold quiet voic ask him what he had
to sai to thi stori
i have to sai major vernon that it is a clever mixtur of truth
and falsehood it is true that your cousin champershaswel ha been
prove guilti of some veri shame conduct for instanc it appear
that he did forg or rather caus to be forg that firman from
the sultan although i knew noth of thi until it wa publicli
repudi it is also true that fear exposur he entir lost hi
head and spent not onli hi own great fortun but that of miss champer
also in try to support sahara share i admit also that i sold mani
hundr of thousand of those share in the ordinari wai have made
up my mind to retir from busi when i wa rais to the peerag
i admit further what you knew befor that i wa attach to miss
champer and wish to marri her why should i not especi as i had
a good deal to offer to a ladi who ha been prove to be almost without
fortun
for the rest she set out secretli on thi mad journei to africa
whither both my duti as her truste and my affect prompt me to
follow her i found her here recov from an ill and sinc she
ha dwelt upon the point in selfdef i must tell you that
whatev ha taken place between us ha been with her full consent and
encourag of cours i allud onli to those affection amen
which ar common between peopl who purpos to marri as soon as
opportun mai offer
at thi declar poor barbara gasp and lean back against her
pillow alan stood silent though hi lip turn white while jeeki
thrust hi big head through the tent open and stare upward
what ar you look at jeeki ask alan irrit
seem to want air major also look to see if cloud tumbl believ
partickl big lie do that sometim pleas go on o good lord for
jeeki want hi breakfast
as regard the execut of two of miss champer bearer and the
flog of some other these punish were inflict for mutini
went on aylward it wa obvious necessari that she should be move
back to the coast but i found out that thei were try to desert her
in a bodi and to tamper with my own servant and so wa oblig to take
strong measur

someth rummi happen
i have onli to add major vernon that unless you make awai with me
first as i daresai you will as soon as we reach civil again i
shall proce against you and thi fellow for the coldblood murder
of my men in punish of which i hope yet to live to see you hang

ar wise you will rememb that you never have been and never will be
my match it will turn again i have no doubt and then you mai look to
yourself for i warn you i am a bad enemi
alan did not answer but for the first time barbara sprang to her feet
and spoke

meal in peac sinc no asiki appear as soon as it wa swallow she
return to her tent while alan and jeeki set to work to strengthen
the defenc of the littl camp as well as thei were abl and to make
readi and serv out the arm and ammunit
about middai a man whom thei had post in a tree that grew insid the
camp announc that he saw the enemi and next moment a compani of them
rush toward them across the open and were greet by a vollei which
kill and wound sever men at thi exhibit of miracul power
for none of these soldier had ever heard the report of firearm or

so as there wa noth els to do thei stai labour all dai at the
strengthen of their fortif till at length the boma or fenc
of bough support by earth wa so high and thick that while ani were
left to fire through the loophol it would be veri difficult to storm
by men arm with spear
it wa a dread and arduou dai for alan who now had barbara safeti
to think of barbara with whom as yet he had scarc found time to
exchang a word by sunset inde he wa so worn out with toil and
anxieti that he could scarc stand upon hi feet jeeki who all
that afternoon had been strang quiet and reflect survei him
critic then said
you have good drink and go sleep a bit major veri good littl
shelter there by miss barbara tent and you hold her hand if you like
underneath the canva which comfort and all correct jeeki never
get tire he keep good lookout and let you know if anyth happen and
then you jump up quit fresh and fight like tomcat in corner
at first alan refus to listen but when barbara ad her entreati
to those of jeeki he gave wai and ten minut later wa as soundli
asleep as he had ever been in hi life
keep ey on him miss barbara and call me if he wake now i go give
nobl lord hi supper and see that he quit comfort jeeki seem
veri busi tonight just like when major have dinnerparti at yarlei
and old cook get drunk in kitchen
if barbara could have follow jeeki movement for the next few
hour she would probabl have agre that he wa busi first he went
to aylward tent and as he had said he would gave him hi supper
and with it half a bottl of whiski from the store which he had been
carri about with him for some time as he said to prevent the
porter from get at it aylward would drink littl though as hi
arm were ti to the tentpol jeeki sat besid him and fed him like
a babi convers pleasantli with him all the while inform him
amongst other thing that he had better sai big prayer becaus the
asiki would probabl cut hi throat befor morn
aylward who wa in a state of sullen furi scarc repli to thi
talk except to sai that if so there wa on comfort thei would cut
hi and hi master also
ye my lord answer jeeki that quit true so drink to next

tail and i wing you horn and i crown of glori of cours we not talk

not offer on to poor old jeeki well he turn teetotal so no
matter goodnight my lord i call you if asiki come
who ar the asiki ask aylward drowsili
oh you want to know i tell you and he began a long rambl stori
befor he ever came to the end of it aylward had fallen on hi side and
wa fast asleep
dear me said jeeki contempl him that whiski veri strong
though bottl sai same as thei drink in hous of common that whiski
so strong i think i pour awai rest of it and he did to the last drop
even take the troubl to wash out the bottl with water now you no
tempt anyon he said address the said bottl with a veri peculiar
smile or if you tempt at least do no harmlik kiss down telephon
then he laid down the bottl on it side and left the tent
outsid of it three of the head porter who appear to be friend
of hi were wait for him and with these men he engag in low and
earnest convers next after thei had arriv at some agreement
which thei seem to ratifi by a curiou oath that involv their
cross and clasp hand in an odd fashion and other symbol known
to west african secret societi jeeki went the round of the camp to
see that everyon wa at hi post then he did what most peopl would
have thought a veri curiou and strang thing name climb the fenc
and vanish into the forest where present a sound wa heard as of an
owl hoot
a littl while later and anoth owl began to hoot in the distanc
whereat the three head porter nudg each other perhap thei had heard
such owl hoot befor at night and perhap thei knew that jeeki who
had pass bonsa could onli be harm by the direct command of bonsa
speak through the mouth of the asika herself still thei might have
been interest in the nocturn convers of those two owl which
as is common with such magic fowl in west africa had transform
themselv into human shape the shape of jeeki and the shape of an
asiki priest who wa as it happen a blood relat of jeeki
veri good brother said owl no 1 all you want is thi white man
whom the asika desir for a husband well i have done my best for him
but i must think of myself and other and he goe to great happi
i have given him someth to make him sleep do you come present with
eight men no more or we shall kill you to the fenc of the camp and
we will hand over the white man vernoon to you to take back to the
asika who will give you a wonder reward such a reward as you have
never imagin now let me hear your word

robe and breastplat of gold stand upon the air just beyond the
ship as though on it she might set no foot her wave black hair hung
about her shoulder but the sharp wind did not seem to stir it nor did
her white dress flutter and on her beauti face wa stamp a look
of aw rage and agoni the rage of betray the agoni of loss in
her right hand she held a knife and from a wound in her breast the
red blood ran down her golden corselet she point to jeeki with the
knife she open her arm to alan as though in unutter long
then slowli rais them upward toward the fade glori of the sky
