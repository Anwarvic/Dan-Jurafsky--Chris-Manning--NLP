beauti beauti wa that night no air that stir the black
smoke from the funnel of the mail steamer zanzibar lai low over the
surfac of the sea like vast float ostrich plume that vanish on
by on in the starlight benita beatrix clifford for that wa her full
name who had been christen benita after her mother and beatrix after
her father onli sister lean idli over the bulwark rail thought
to herself that a child might have sail that sea in a boat of bark and
come safe into port
then a tall man of about thirti year of ag who wa smoke a cigar
stroll up to her at hi come she move a littl as though to make
room for him besid her and there wa someth in the motion which
had anyon been there to observ it might have suggest that these two
were upon term of friendship or still greater intimaci for a moment
he hesit and while he did so an express of doubt of distress
even gather on hi face it wa as though he understood that a great
deal depend on whether he accept or declin that gentl invit
and knew not which to do
inde much did depend upon it no less than the destini of both of
them if robert seymour had gone by to finish hi cigar in solitud why
then thi stori would have had a veri differ end or rather who
can sai how it might have end the dread foredoom event with which
that night wa big would have come to it aw birth leav certain
word unspoken violent separ must have ensu and even if both of
them had surviv the terror what prospect wa there that their live
would again have cross each other in that wide africa
but it wa not so fate for just as he put hi foot forward to continu
hi march benita spoke in her low and pleasant voic
ar you go to the smokingroom or to the saloon to danc mr
seymour on of the offic just told me that there is to be a danc
she ad in explan becaus it is so calm that we might fanci
ourselv ashor

ar over no i propos to take exercis after that big dinner and
then to sit in a chair and fall asleep but he ad and hi voic
grew interest how did you know that it wa i you never turn your
head
i have ear in my head as well as ey she answer with a littl
laugh and after we have been nearli a month togeth on thi ship i
ought to know your step
i never rememb that anyon ever recogn it befor he said more
to himself than to her then came and lean over the rail at her side
hi doubt were gone fate had spoken
for a while there wa silenc between them then he ask her if she
were not go to the danc
benita shook her head
why not you ar fond of danc and you danc veri well also there
ar plenti of offic for partner especi captain and he
check himself
i know she said it would be pleasant butmr seymour will you
think me foolish if i tell you someth
i have never thought you foolish yet miss clifford so i dont know
why i should begin now what is it
i am not go to the danc becaus i am afraid ye horribl afraid

of us upon the edg of some dread catastrophea though there were
about to be a mighti chang and beyond it anoth life someth
new and unfamiliar it came over me at dinnerthat wa why i left the
tabl quit suddenli i look and all the peopl were differ ye

and the dinner wa veri long and heavi i told you so that why im
takingi mean why i want to take exercis
and to go to sleep afterward
ye first the exercis then the sleep miss clifford that is the
rule of lifeand death with sleep thought end therefor for some of
us your catastroph is much to be desir for it would mean long sleep
and no thought
i said that thei were chang not that thei had ceas to think
perhap thei thought the more
then let us prai that your catastroph mai be avert i prescrib
for you bismuth and carbon of soda also in thi weather it seem
difficult to imagin such a thing look now miss clifford he ad
with a note of enthusiasm in hi voic point toward the east

where on earth she ask astonish
in a queer place as i told you i have visit south africa befor
under differ circumst four year ago i wa out here biggam
shoot go in from the east coast my brother and ih is dead now
poor fellowgot up somewher in the matabel countri on the bank of
the zambesi as we didnt find much game there we were go to strike
south when some nativ told us of a wonder ruin that stood on
a hill overhang the river a few mile farther on so leav the
waggon on the hither side of the steep nek over which it would have
been difficult to drag it my brother and i took our rifl and a bag
of food and start the place wa farther off than we thought although
from the top of the nek we could see it clearli enough and befor we
reach it dark had fallen
now we had observ a waggon and a tent outsid the wall which we
thought must belong to white men and head for them there wa a light
in the tent and the flap wa open the night be veri hot insid
two men were seat on old with a grei beard and the other a
goodlook fellowund forti i should saywith a jewish face
dark pierc ey and a black point beard thei were engag
in examin a heap of gold bead and bangl which lai on the tabl
between them as i wa about to speak the blackbeard man heard or
caught sight of us and seiz a rifl that lean against the tabl
swung round and cover me
for god sake dont shoot jacob said the old man thei ar
english
best dead ani wai answer the other in a soft voic with a
slight foreign accent we dont want spi or thiev here
we ar neither but i can shoot as well as you friend i remark
for by thi time my rifl wa on him
then he thought better of it and drop hi gun and we explain
that we were mere on an archolog expedit the end of it wa
that we becam capit friend though neither of us could cotton much
to mr jacobi forget hi other name he struck me as too handi with
hi rifl and wa i gather an individu with a mysteri and
rather lurid past to cut a long stori short when he found out that
we had no intent of poach your father for it wa he told us
frankli that thei were treasurehunt have got hold of some
stori about a vast store of gold which had been hidden awai there by
portugues two or three centuri befor their troubl wa howev
that the makalanga who live in the fortress which wa call
bambats would not allow them to dig becaus thei said the place wa
haunt and if thei did so it would bring bad luck to their tribe
and did thei ever get in ask benita
i am sure i dont know for we went next dai though befor we left we
call on the makalanga who admit us all readili enough so long as
we brought no spade with us by the wai the gold we saw your father
and hi friend examin wa found in some ancient grave outsid the
wall but had noth to do with the big and mythic treasur
what wa the place like i love old ruin broke in benita again
oh wonder a gigant circular wall built by heaven know who
then halfwai up the hill anoth wall and near the top a third wall
which i understood surround a sort of holi of holi and abov
everyth on the brink of the precipic a great cone of granit
artifici or natur
i dont know thei would not let us up there but we were introduc
to their chief and high priest church and state in on and a wonder
old man he wa veri wise and veri gentl i rememb he told me he
believ we should meet again which seem an odd thing for him to sai
i ask him about the treasur and why he would not let the other white
men look for it he answer that it would never be found by ani man
white or black that onli a woman would find it at the appoint time
when it pleas the spirit of bambats under whose guardianship it
wa
who wa the spirit of bambats mr seymour
i cant tell you couldnt make out anyth definit about her except
that she wa said to be white and to appear sometim at sunris or in
the moonlight stand upon the tall point of rock of which i told you
i rememb that i got up befor the dawn to look for herlik an idiot
for of cours i saw nothingand that all i know about the matter
did you have ani talk with my father mr seymouralon i mean
ye a littl the next dai he walk back to our waggon with us be
glad i fanci of a chang from the perpetu societi of hi partner
jacob that wasnt wonder in a man who had been brought up at
eton and oxford as i found out he had like myself and whatev hi
fail mai have beenalthough we saw no sign of them for he would
not touch a drop of spiritswa a gentleman which jacob wasnt still
hejacobhad read a lot especi on outofthewai subject
and could talk everi languag under the suna clever and agreeabl
scoundrel in short
did my father sai anyth about himself
ye he told me that he had been an unsuccess man all hi life
and had much to reproach himself with for we got quit confidenti at
last he ad that he had a famili in englandwhat famili he didnt
saywhom he wa anxiou to make wealthi by wai of repar for past
misde and that wa why he wa treasurehunt howev from what
you tell me i fear he never found anyth
no mr seymour he never found it and never will but all the same
i am glad to hear that he wa think of us also i should like to
explor that place bambats
so should i miss clifford in your compani and your father but not
in that of jacob if ever you should go there with him i saybewar
of jacob
oh i am not afraid of jacob she answer with a laugh although i
believ that my father still ha someth to do with himat least in
on of hi letter he mention hi partner who wa a german
a german i think that he must have meant a german jew
after thi there wa silenc between them for a time then he said
suddenli you have told me your stori would you like to hear mine
ye she answer

like can needi knifegrind i have realli none to tell you

undistinguish member of what is call in england the leisur
class who can do absolut noth that is worth do except shoot
straight

it is an honest fact that for the last fifteen yearsi wa thirtytwo
thi monthpract my whole time ha been given up to it with a
littl fish thrown in in the spring as i want to make the most of
myself i will add that i am suppos to be among the six best shot in
england and that my ambitiony great heaven my ambitionwa to
becom better than the other five by that sin fell the poor man who
speak to you i wa suppos to have abil but i neglect them
all to pursu thi form of idl i enter no profess i did
no work with the result that at thirtytwo i am ruin and almost
hopeless
why ruin and hopeless she ask anxious for the wai in which
thei were spoken griev her more than the word themselv
ruin becaus my old uncl the honour john seymour seymour whose
heir i wa commit the indiscret of marri a young ladi who ha
present him with thrive twin with the appear of those twin my
prospect disappear as did the allow of 1500 a year that he
wa good enough to make me on which to keep up a posit as hi
nextofkin i had someth of my own but also i had debt and at the
present moment a draft in my pocket for 2163 14 5d and a littl
loos cash repres the total of my worldli good just about the sum
i have been accustom to spend per annum
i dont call that ruin i call that rich said benita reliev
with 2000 to begin on you mai make a fortun in africa but how about
the hopeless
i am hopeless becaus i have absolut noth to which to look
forward realli when that 2000 is gone i do not know how to earn a
sixpenc in thi dilemma it occur to me that the onli thing i could
do wa to turn my shoot to practic account and becom a hunter of
big game therefor i propos to kill eleph until an eleph kill
me at least he ad in a chang voic i did so propos until half
an hour ago

have i chang my veri modest scheme of life miss clifford as you ar
so good as to be suffici interest i will tell you it is becaus
a temptat which hitherto i have been abl to resist ha dure the
last thirti minut becom too strong for me you know everyth ha

enough to give me the answer that i expect meanwhil for the first
time in my life allow me the luxuri of be in earnest to me it is a
new sensat and therefor veri priceless mai i go on
benita made no answer he rose with a certain deliber which
character all hi movementsfor robert seymour never seem to be
in a hurryand stood in front of her so that the moonlight shone upon
her face while hi own remain in shadow
beyond that 2000 of which i have spoken and incident it
owner i have noth whatsoev to offer to you i am an indig and
worthless person even in my prosper dai when i could look forward
to a larg estat although it wa often suggest to me i never
consid myself justifi in ask ani ladi to shareth prospect
estat i think now that the real reason wa that i never care
suffici for ani ladi sinc otherwis my selfish would probabl
have overcom my scrupl as it doe tonight benita for i will call
you so if for the first and last time iilov you
listen now he went on drop hi measur manner and speak
hurriedli like a man with an earnest messag and littl time in which
to deliv it it is an odd thing an incomprehens thing but
true truei fell in love with you the first time i saw your face you
rememb you stood there lean over the bulwark when i came on board
at southampton and as i walk up the gangwai i look and my ey met
your then i stop and that stout old ladi who got off at madeira
bump into me and ask me to be good enough to make up my mind if i
were go backward or forward do you rememb
ye she answer in a low voic
which thing ar an allegori he continu i felt it so at the time
ye i had half a mind to answer backward and give up my berth in
thi ship then i look at you again and someth insid of me said
forward so i came up the rest of the gangwai and took off my hat
to you a salut i had no right to make but which i recal you
acknowledg
he paus then continu as it began so it ha gone on it is alwai
like that is it not the begin is everyth the end must follow

shoot parti and as a man of the world i will ventur to give you a
bit of advic it is possibl that to you my life and death affair is
a mere matter of boardship amus yet it is possibl also that you
might take anoth view of the matter in that case as a friend and a
man of the world i entreat youdont have noth to do with me send
me about my busi you will never regret it
ar you make fun or is all thi meant mr seymour ask benita
still speak beneath her breath and look straight befor her

not at least i am honest now have told you that i am or wa half
an hour ago an idler a goodfornoth prospectless failur i ask

she half rose and glanc at him for the first time saw hi face
contract itself and turn pale in the moonlight it mai be that the
sight of it affect her even to the extent of remov some advers
impress left by the bitter mock of hi selfblam at ani rate
benita seem to chang her mind and sat down again sai
go on if you wish
he bow slightli and said
i thank you i have told you what i wa half an hour ago now hope
that you will believ me i will tell you what i am i am a truli
repent man on upon whom a new light ha risen i am not veri old
and i think that underneath it all i have some abil opportun
mai still come my wai if it doe not for your sake i will make the
opportun i do not believ that you can ever find anyon who would
love you better or care for you more tenderli i desir to live for you
in the futur more complet even than in the past i have live for
myself i do not wish to influenc you by person appeal but in fact
i stand at the part of the wai if you will give yourself to me
i feel as though i might still becom a husband of whom you could be
proudif not i write fini upon the tombston of the possibl
of robert seymour i ador you you ar the on woman with whom i desir
to pass my dai it is you who have alwai been lack to my life i
ask you to be brave to take the risk of marri me although i can see

in thi world and i more than you we have just to consid ourselv
not what we have or have not
so be it miss clifford then i have noth more to sai now it is for
you to answer
just then the sound of the piano and the fiddl in the saloon ceas
on of the waltz wa over and some of the dancer came upon deck to
flirt or to cool themselv on pair engag veri obvious in the
former occup station themselv so near to robert and benita
that further convers between them wa imposs and there
proceed to interchang the remark common to such occas
for a good ten minut did thei stand thu carri on a mock quarrel
as to a danc of which on of them wa suppos to have been defraud
until robert seymour gener a veri philosoph person could have
slain those innoc lover he felt he knew not why that hi chanc
were slip awai from him that sensat of someth bad about to
happen of which benita had spoken spread from her to him the suspens
grew exasper terribl even nor could it be end to ask her to
come elsewher wa under the circumst not feasibl especi as
he would also have been oblig to request the other pair to make wai
for them and all thi time with a sink of the heart he felt that
probabl benita wa beat down ani tender which she might feel
toward him that when her longdelai answer did come the chanc were
it would be no
the piano began to plai again in the saloon and the young peopl still
squabbl archli at length prepar to depart suddenli there wa a
stir upon the bridg and against the tender sky robert saw a man dash
forward next instant the engineroom bell rang fierc he knew the
signalit wa stop follow at onc by other ring that meant
full speed astern
i wonder what is up said the young man to the young woman
befor the word had left hi lip thei knew there wa a sensat as
though all the hull of the great ship had come to a complet standstil
while the top part of her continu to travel forward follow by
anoth sensat still more terribl and sicken in it naturethat
of slip over someth helplessli heavili as a man slip upon ic
or a polish floor spar crack rope flew in two with a nois as of
pistol shot heavi object rush about the deck travel forward
all of them benita wa hurl from her chair against robert so that the
two of them roll into the scupper he wa unhurt and pick himself
up but she lai still and he saw that someth had struck her upon the
head for blood wa run down her cheek he lift her and fill
with black horror and despairfor he thought her gonepress hi hand
upon her heart thank god it began to beat againsh still live
the music in the saloon had stop and for a littl while there
wa silenc then of an instant there aros the horribl clamour of
shipwreck wildei peopl rush to and fro aimlessli here and there
women and children shriek a clergyman fell upon hi knee and began
to prai
thi went on for a space till present the second offic appear
and affect an unconcern air call out that it wa all right the
captain said no on wa to be afraid he ad that thei were not more
than six mile from the shore and that the ship would be beach in
half an hour inde as he spoke the engin which had been stop
commenc to work again and her head swung round in a wide circl
point to the land evid thei had pass over the rock and were
onc more in deep water through which thei travel at a good speed
but with a heavi list to starboard the pump got to work also with a
monoton clang beat throw out great column of foam water
on to the oili sea men began to cut the cover off the boat and to
swing some of them outboard such were the thing that went on about
them
with the senseless benita clasp to hi breast the blood from her cut
head run down hi shoulder robert stood still awhil think
then he made up hi mind as it chanc she had a deck cabin and
thither he forc hi wai carri her tenderli and with patienc
through the distract throng of passeng for there were five hundr
soul on board that ship he reach the place to find that it wa quit
empti her cabinm have fled lai benita upon the lower bunk
he lit the swing candl as soon as it burn up he search for
the lifebelt and by good fortun found two of them on of which not
without great difficulti he succeed in fasten round her then he
took a spong and bath her head with water there wa a great bruis
upon her templ where the block or whatev it wa had struck her and
the blood still flow but the wound wa not veri deep or extens
nor so far as he could discov did the bone appear to be broken or
driven in he had good hope that she wa onli stun and would reviv
present unabl to do more for her a thought struck him on the floor
of the cabin thrown by the shock from the rack lai her write case
he open it and take a piec of paper wrote these word hurriedli in
pencil
you gave me no answer and it is more than probabl that i shall
receiv none in thi world which on or both of us mai be upon the
verg of leav in the latter case we can settl the matter
elsewhereperhap in the former should it be my lot to go and your
to stai i hope that you will think kindli of me at time as of on
who love you truli should it be your to go then you will never read
these word yet if to the dead is given knowledg be assur that as
you left me so you shall find me your and your alon or perhap we
both mai live i prai so r s
fold up the paper he undid a button of benita blous and thrust
it awai there know that thu she would certainli find it should she
surviv then he step out on to the deck to see what wa happen
the vessel still steam but made slow progress moreov the list to
starboard wa now so pronounc that it wa difficult to stand upright
on account of it nearli all the passeng were huddl togeth upon
the port side have instinct taken refug as far as possibl
abov the water a man with a white distraught face stagger toward
him support himself by the bulwark it wa the captain for a
moment he paus as though to think hold to a stanchion robert
seymour saw hi opportun and address him
forgiv me he said i do not like interf with other peopl
busi but for reason unconnect with myself i suggest to you that
it would be wise to stop thi ship and get out the boat the sea is
calm if it is not left till too late there should be no difficulti in
launch them
the man stare at him absent then said
thei wont hold everybodi mr seymour i hope to beach her
at least thei will hold some he answer wherea and he
point to the water which by now wa almost level with the deck
perhap you ar right mr seymour it doesnt matter to me anywai i
am a ruin man but the poor passengersth poor passeng and he
scrambl awai fierc toward the bridg like a wound cat along
the bough of a tree whenc in a few second robert heard him shout
order
a minut or so afterward the steamer stop too late the captain
had decid to sacrific hi ship and save those she carri thei were
begin to get out the boat now robert return to the cabin where
benita wa ly senseless and wrap her up in a cloak and some
blanket then see the second lifebelt on the floor by an
afterthought he put it on know that there wa time to spare next he
lift benita and feel sure that the rush would be for the starboard
side on which the boat were quit near the water carri her with
difficulti for the slope wa steep to the portcutt which he knew
would be in the charg of a good man the second offic whom he had
seen in command there at sundai boatdril
here as he had anticip the crowd wa small sinc most peopl
thought that it would not be possibl to get thi boat down safe to
the water or if their power of reflect were gone instinct told
them so that skil seaman the second offic and hi appoint
crew were alreadi at work lower the cutter from the davit
now he said women and children first
a number rush in and robert saw that the boat would soon be full
i am afraid he said that i must count myself a woman as i carri
on and by a great effort hold benita with on arm with the other
he let himself down the fall and assist by a quartermast gain
the boat in safeti
on or two other men scrambl after him
push her off said the offic she can hold no more and the rope
were let go
when thei were about twelv feet from the ship side from which
thei thrust themselv clear with oar there came a rush of peopl
disappoint of place in the starboard boat a few of the boldest
of these swarm down the fall other jump and fell among them or
miss and drop into the sea or struck upon the side of the boat
and were kill still she reach the water upon an even keel though
now much overladen the oar were got out and thei row round the bow
of the great ship wallow in her deaththro their first idea be
to make for the shore which wa not three mile awai
thi brought them to the starboard side where thei saw a hideou scene
hundr of peopl seem to be fight for room with the result that
some of the boat were overturn precipit their occup into
the water other hung by the prow or the stern the rope have jam
in the davit in the frantic hast and confus while from them human
be drop on by on round other not yet launch a hellish
struggl wa in progress the struggl of men women and children
battl for their live in which the strong mad with terror show
no merci to the weak
from that mass of human most of them about to perish went up a
babel of sound which in it sum shape itself to on prolong scream
such as might proce from a titan in hi agoni all thi beneath a
brood moonlit sky and on a sea as smooth as glass upon the ship
which now lai upon her side the siren still sent up it yell for
succour and some brave man continu to fire rocket which rush
heavenward and burst in shower of star
robert rememb that the last rocket he had seen wa fire at an
even fte for the amus of the audienc the contrast struck
him as dread he wonder whether there were ani power or infern
popul that could be amus by a tragedi such as enact itself
befor hi ey how it came about also that such a tragedi wa
permit by the merci strength in which mankind put their faith
the vessel wa turn over compress air or steam burst up the deck
with loud report fragment of wreckag flew into the air there the
poor captain still clung to the rail of the bridg seymour could see
hi white faceth moonlight seem to paint it with a ghastli smile
the offic in command of their boat shout to the crew to give wai
lest thei should be suck down with the steamer
look now she wallow like a dy whale the moonrai shone white upon
her bottom show the jag rent made in it by the rock on which she
had struck and now she wa gone onli a littl cloud of smoke and steam
remain to mark where the zanzibar had been
iii
how robert came ashor
in place of the zanzibar a great pit on the face of the ocean in
which the water boil and black object appear and disappear
sit still for your live sake said the offic in a quiet voic
the suck is come
in anoth minut it came drag them downward till the water
trickl over the side of the boat and backward toward the pit but
befor ever thei reach it the deep had digest it prei and save
for the great airbubbl which burst about them and a mix unnatur
swell wa calm again for the moment thei were safe
passeng said the offic i am go to put out to seaat ani
rate till daylight we mai meet a vessel there and if we try to row
ashor we shall certainli be swamp in the breaker
no on object thei seem too stun to speak but robert thought to
himself that the man wa wise thei began to move but befor thei had
gone a dozen yard someth dark rose besid them it wa a piec
of wreckag and cling to it a woman who clasp a bundl to her
breast more she wa aliv for she began to cry to them to take her
in
save me and my child she cri for god sake save me
robert recogn the choke voic it wa that of a young marri ladi
with whom he had been veri friendli who wa go out with her babi to
join her husband in natal he stretch out hi hand and caught hold of
her whereon the offic said heavili
the boat is alreadi overladen i must warn you that to take more aboard
is not safe
thereon the passeng awok from their stupor
push her off cri a voic she must take her chanc and there wa
a murmur of approv at the dread word
for christ sakefor christ sake wail the drown woman who
clung desper to robert hand
if you try to pull her in we will throw you overboard said the voic
again and a knife wa lift as though to hack at hi arm then the
offic spoke onc more
thi ladi cannot come into the boat unless someon goe out of it i
would myself but it is my duti to stai is there ani man here who will
make place for her
but all the men thereseven of them besid the crewhung their head
and were silent
give wai said the offic in the same heavi voic she will drop off
present
while the word pass hi lip robert seem to live a year here wa
an opportun of aton for hi idl and luxuri life an hour ago
he would have taken it gladli but nownow with benita senseless on
hi breast and that answer still lock in her sleep heart yet
benita would approv of such a death as thi and even if she love him
not in life would learn to love hi memori in an instant hi mind wa
made up and he wa speak rapidli
thompson he said to the offic if i go will you swear to take her
in and her child
certainli mr seymour
then lai to i am go if ani of you live tell thi ladi how i
di and he point to benita and sai i thought that she would wish
it
she shall be told said the offic again and save too if i can
do it
hold mr jeffrei then till i am out of thi ill leav my coat to
cover her
a sailor obei and with difficulti robert wrench free hi hand
veri deliber he press benita to hi breast and kiss her on the
forehead then let her gentli slide on to the bottom of the boat next
he slip off hi overcoat and slowli roll himself over the gunwal
into the sea
now he said pull mr jeffrei in
god bless you you ar a brave man said thompson i shall rememb
you if i live a hundr year
but no on els said anyth perhap thei were all too much asham
even then
i have onli done my duti seymour answer from the water how far is
it to the shore
about three mile shout thompson but keep on that plank or you
will never live through the roller goodby
goodby answer robert
then the boat pass awai from him and soon vanish in the misti face
of the deep
rest on the plank which had save the life of mr jeffrei robert
seymour look about him and listen now and again he heard a faint
choke scream utter by some drown wretch and a few hundr yard
awai caught sight of a black object which he thought might be a boat if
so he reflect that it must be full moreov he could not overtak
it no hi onli chanc wa to make for the shore he wa a strong
swimmer and happili the water wa almost as warm as milk there seem
to be no reason why he should not reach it support as he wa by a
lifebelt if the shark would leav him alon which thei might as
there wa plenti for them to feed on the direct he knew well enough
for now in the great silenc of the sea he could hear the boom of the
mighti roller break on the beach
ah those roller he rememb how that veri afternoon benita and he
had watch them through hi field glass sprout up against the cruel
wall of rock and wonder that when the ocean wa so calm thei had
still such power now should he live to reach them he wa doom to
match himself against that power well the sooner he did so the sooner
it would be over on wai or the other thi wa in hi favour the tide
had turn and wa flow shoreward inde he had littl to do but
to rest upon hi plank which he place crosswis beneath hi breast
and steer himself with hi feet even thu he made good progress
nearli a mile an hour perhap he could have gone faster had he swum
but he wa save hi strength
it wa a strang journei upon that silent sea beneath those silent
star and strang thought came into robert soul he wonder whether
benita would live and what she would sai perhap howev she wa
alreadi dead and he would meet her present he wonder if he were
doom to die and whether thi sacrific of hi would be allow to
aton for hi past error he hope so and put up a petit to that
effect for himself and for benita and for all the poor peopl who had
gone befor hurl from their pleasur into the hall of death
so he float on while the boom of the breaker grew ever nearer
companion by hi wild fret thought till at length what he took
to be a shark appear quit close to him and in the urgenc of the
moment he gave up wonder it prove to be onli a piec of wood but
later on a real shark did come for he saw it back fin howev thi
cruel creatur wa either gorg or timid for when he splash upon the
water and shout it went awai to return no more
now at length robert enter upon the deep hill and vallei swell which
preced the field of the roller suddenli he shot down a smooth slope
and without effort of hi own found himself born up an oppos steep
from the crest of which he had a view of white line of foam and beyond
them of a dim and rocki shore at on spot a littl to hi right the
foam seem thinner and the line of cliff to be broken as though here
there wa a cleft for thi cleft then he steer hi plank take
the swell obliqu which by good fortun the set of the tide enabl
him to do without ani great exert
the vallei grew deeper and the top of the oppos ridg were
crest with foam he had enter the roller and the struggl for life
began befor him thei rush solemn and mighti view from some safe
place even the sight of these comber is terribl as ani who have
watch them from thi coast or from that of the island of ascens
can bear wit what their aspect wa to thi shipwreck man
support by a singl plank mai therefor be imagin seen as he
saw them in the mysteri moonlight and in utter loneli yet hi
spirit rose to meet the dread emerg if he were to die he would die
fight he had grown cold and tire but now the chill and weari
left him he felt warm and strong from the crest of on of the high
roller he thought he saw that about half a mile awai from him a littl
river ran down the centr of the gorg and for the mouth of thi river
he laid hi cours
at first all went well he wa born up the sea he slid down the sea
in a lather of white foam present the rise and fall grew steeper
and the foam began to break over hi head robert could no longer guid
himself he must go as he wa carri then in an instant he wa carri
into a hell of water where had it not been for hi lifebelt and the
plank he must have been beaten down and have perish as it wa now
he wa driven into the depth and now he emerg upon their surfac to
hear their seeth hiss around him and abov it all a continu boom
as of great gunsth boom of the break sea
the plank wa almost twist from hi grasp but he clung to it
desper although it edg tore hi arm when the roller broke
over him he held hi breath and when he wa toss skyward on their
curv drew it again in quick sweet gasp now he sat upon the veri
brow of on of them as a merman might now he dive like a dolphin
and now just as hi sens were leav him hi feet touch bottom
anoth moment and robert wa be roll along that bottom with a
weight on him like the weight of mountain the plank wa rent from him
but hi cork jacket brought him up the backwash drew him with it into
deeper water where he lai helpless and despair for he no longer had
ani strength to struggl against hi doom
then it wa that there came a mighti roller bigger than ani that he had
seensuch a on as on that coast the kaffir call a father of wave
it caught him in the embrac of it vast green curv it bore him
forward as though he were but a straw far forward over the stretch of
cruel rock it broke in thunder dash him again upon the stone
and sand of the littl river bar roll him along with it resistless
might till even that might wa exhaust and it foam began to return
seaward suck him with it
robert mind wa almost gone but enough of it remain to tell him
that if onc more he wa drag into the deep water he must be lost as
the current hale him along he grip at the bottom with hi hand
and by the merci of heaven thei close on someth it mai have been
a treestump embed there or a rockh never knew at least it wa
firm and to it he hung despairingli would that rush never ceas hi
lung were burst he must let go oh the foam wa thin hi head
wa abov it now now it had depart leav him like a strand fish
upon the shingl for half a minut or more he lai there gasp then
look behind him to see anoth comber approach through the
gloom he struggl to hi feet fell rose again and ran or rather
stagger forward with that tigerish water hiss at hi heel
forward still forward till he wa beyond it reachy on dry
sand then hi vital forc fail him on of hi leg gave wai and
bleed from a hundr hurt he fell heavili onto hi face and there
wa still
the boat in which benita lai be so deep in the water prove
veri hard to row against the tide for the number of it passeng
encumb the oarsmen after a while a light off land breez sprang
up as here it often doe toward morn and the offic thompson
determin to risk hoist the sail accordingli thi wa donewith
some difficulti for the mast had to be drawn out and shippedalthough
the women scream as the weight of the air bent their frail craft over
till the gunwal wa almost level with the water
anyon who move shall be thrown overboard said the offic who
steer after which thei were quiet
now thei made good progress seaward but the anxieti of those who
knew were veri great sinc the wind show sign of rise and if ani
swell should spring up that crowd cutter could scarc hope to live
in fact two hour later thei were forc to lower the sail again and
drift wait for the dawn mr thompson strove to cheer them sai
that now thei were in the track of vessel and if thei could see none
when the light came he would run along the shore in the hope of find
a place free of breaker where thei might land if thei did not inspir
hope at least hi word calm them and thei sat in heavi silenc
watch the sky
at length it grew grei and then with a sudden glori peculiar to south
africa the great red sun aros and began to dispel the mist from the
surfac of the sea half an hour more and thi wa gone and now the
bright rai brought life back into their chill frame as thei stare
at each other to see which of their compani were still left aliv thei
even ask for food and biscuit wa given to them with water
all thi while benita remain unconsci inde on callou fellow
who had been us her bodi as a footstool said that she must be dead
and had better be thrown overboard as it would lighten the boat
if you throw that ladi into the sea live or dead said mr
thompson with an omin lift of hi ey you go with her mr batten
rememb who brought her here and how he di
then mr batten held hi peac while thompson stood up and scan the
wide expans of sea present he whisper to a sailor near him who
also stood up look and nod
that will be the other line intermedi boat he said and the
passeng crane their head round saw far awai to the right a
streak of smoke upon the horizon order were given a littl corner of
sail wa hoist with a white cloth of some sort ti abov it and the
oar were got out onc more the cutter move forward bear to the
left in the hope of intercept the steamer
she came on with terribl swift and thei who had mile of water to
cover dare hoist no more sail in that breez in half an hour she wa
nearli opposit to them and thei were still far awai a littl more
sail wa let out drive them through the water at as quick a rate
as thei could ventur to go the steamer wa pass three mile or so
awai and black despair took hold of them now the resourc thompson
without apolog undress and remov the white shirt that he had
worn at the danc bade a sailor to tie it to an oar and wave it to and
fro
still the steamer went on until present thei heard her siren go
and saw that she wa put about
she ha seen us said thompson thank god all of you for there is
wind come up pull down that sail we shant need it ani more
half an hour later with mani precaut for the wind he prophesi
wa alreadi troubl the sea and send littl splash of water over
the stern of their deepli laden boat thei were fast to a line thrown
from the deck of the three thousand ton steamer castl bound for
natal then with a rattl down came the accommod ladder and
strongarm men stand on it grate drag them on by on from
the death to which thei had been so near the last to be lift up
except thompson wa benita round whom it wa necessari to reev a
rope
ani us ask the offic on the grate as he glanc at her quiet
form
cant sai i hope so answer thompson call your doctor and
gentli enough she wa born up the ship side
thei want to cast off the boat but thompson remonstr and in the
end that also wa drag to deck meanwhil the new had spread
and the awaken passeng of the castl clad in pyjama
dressinggown and even blanket were crowd round the poor
castawai or help them to their cabin
i am a teetotal said second offic thompson when he had made a
brief report to the captain of the castl but if anyon will stand
me a whiskei and soda i shall be oblig to him
iv
mr clifford
although the shock of the blow she had receiv upon her head wa
suffici to make her insens for so mani hour benita injuri
were not of a realli seriou natur for as it happen the fall
block or whatev it mai have been had hit her forehead slantwis and
not full to which accid she ow it that although the skin wa
torn and the scalp bruis her skull had escap fractur under proper
medic care her sens soon came back to her but as she wa quit
daze and thought herself still on board the zanzibar the doctor
consid it wise to preserv her in that illus for a while so
after she had swallow some broth he gave her a sleep draught the
effect of which she did not shake off till the follow morn
then she came to herself complet and wa astonish to feel the pain
in her head which had been bandag and to see a strang stewardess
sit by her with a cup of beeftea in her hand
where am i is it a dream she ask

gentleman of that name aboard thi ship
at that moment the doctor came in and him too she pli with
question but have learn the stori of robert selfsacrific from
mr thompson and the other he would give her no answer for he guess
how matter had stood between them and fear the effect of the shock
all he could sai wa that he hope mr seymour had escap in some other
boat
it wa not until the third morn that benita wa allow to learn
the truth which inde it wa imposs to conceal ani longer mr
thompson came to her cabin and told her everyth while she listen
silent horrifi amaz
miss clifford he said i think it wa on of the bravest thing that
a man ever did on the ship i alwai thought him rather a headinair
kind of swell but he wa a splendid fellow and i prai god that he ha
live as the ladi and child for whom he offer himself up have done

still give him that answer
mr thompson repli again that he hope so which be as honest and
tenderheart as he wa brave and capabl he did most earnestli but
in hi heart he reflect that her answer would not be given thi side
of the grave then as he had been deput to do he hand her the note
which had been found in the bosom of her dress and abl to bear no
more of thi pain scene hurri from the cabin she read it greedili
twice and press it to her lip murmur

that afternoon when she wa more compos mr jeffrei came to see
benita bring her babi with her the poor woman wa still pale and
shaken but the child had taken no hurt at all from it immers in

drank two cup of it to warm herself and wash down the hard biscuit
befor the dai wa over glad enough wa she that she had done so
the sun wa rise huge and red it look seen through the cling
mist and their breakfast finish mr clifford gave order that the
oxen which were fill themselv with the dry grass near at hand
should be got up and inspan the voorloop a zulu boi who had left

from hi haunch with a grunt and depart to fetch them a minut or
two later han ceas from hi occup of pack up the thing and
said in a low voic
kek baasthat is look
follow the line of hi outstretch hand benita and her father
perceiv not more than a hundr yard awai from them a great troop
of wilderbeest or gnu travel along a ridg and paus now and
again to indulg in those extraordinari gambol which caus the boer to
declar that these brute have a worm in their brain
give me my rifl han said mr clifford we want meat
by the time that the westleyrichard wa drawn from it case and
load onli on buck remain for have caught sight of the waggon
it turn to stare at it suspici mr clifford aim and fire
down went the buck then spring to it feet again vanish behind
the ridg mr clifford shook hi head sadli
i dont often do that sort of thing my dear but the light is still
veri bad still he hit what do you sai shall we get on the hors
and catch him a canter would warm you
benita who wa tenderheart reflect that it would be kinder to
put the poor creatur out of it pain and nod her head five minut
later thei were canter togeth up the rise mr clifford have
first order the waggon to trek on till thei rejoin it and slip a
packet of cartridg into hi pocket beyond the rise lai a wide stretch
of marshi ground border by anoth rise half a mile or more awai
from the crest of whichfor now the air wa clear enoughthei saw the
wound bull stand on thei went after him but befor thei could
come within shot he had move forward onc more for he wa onli
lightli hurt in the flank and guess whenc hi troubl came
again and again did he retreat as thei drew near until at length just
as mr clifford wa about to dismount to risk a long shot the beast
took to it heel in earnest
come on he said dont let be beat for by thi time the hunter
wa aliv in him
so off thei went at a gallop up slope and down slope that remind
benita of the bai of biscai in a storm across halfdri vlei that in
the wet season were pond through stoni ground and patch of antbear
hole in which thei nearli came to grief for five mile at least the
chase went on sinc at the end of winter the wilderbeest wa thin and
could gallop well notwithstand it injuri faster even than their
good hors at last rise a ridg thei found whither it wa go
for suddenli thei were in the midst of vast herd of game thousand and
ten of thousand of them stretch as far as the ey could reach
it wa a wondrou sight that now ala will be seen no moreat ani
rate upon the transvaal veld wilderbeest blesbok springbok in
countless multitud and amongst them a few quagga and hartebeest
with a sound like that of thunder their flash myriad hoof cast
up cloud of dust from the fireblacken veld the great herd
separ at the appear of their enemi man thi wai and that thei
went in group and long brown line leav the wound and exhaust
wilderbeest behind them so that present he wa the sole tenant of
that great cup of land
at him thei rode till mr clifford who wa a littl ahead of hi
daughter drew almost alongsid then the poor madden brute tri it
last shift stop suddenli it wheel round and charg head down
mr clifford as it came held out hi rifl in hi right hand and fire
at a hazard the bullet pass through the bull but could not stop it
charg it horn held low struck the foreleg of the hors and next
instant hors man and wilderbeest roll on the veld togeth
benita who wa fifti yard behind utter a littl cry of fear but
befor ever she reach him her father had risen laugh for he wa
quit unhurt the hors too wa get up but the bull could rise
no more it struggl to it forefeet utter a kind of sob groan
stare round wildli and roll over dead
i never knew a wilderbeest charg like that befor said mr
clifford confound it i believ my hors is lame
lame it wa inde where the bull had struck the foreleg though
as it chanc not badli have ti a handkerchief to the horn of the
buck in order to scare awai the vultur and thrown some tuft of dry
grass upon it bodi which he propos if possibl to fetch or send
for mr clifford mount hi lame hors and head for the waggon but
thei had gallop farther than thei thought and it wa middai befor
thei came to what thei took to be the road as there wa no spoor upon
it thei follow thi track backward expect to find the waggon
outspan but although thei rode for mile upon mile no waggon could
thei see then realiz their mistak thei retrac their step and
leav thi path at the spot where thei had found it struck off again
to the right
meanwhil the sky wa darken and at about three oclock in the
afternoon a thunderstorm broke over them accompani by torrent of ici
rain the first fall of the spring and a bitter wind which chill them
through more after the heavi rain came drizzl and a thick mist that
deepen as even approach
now their plight wa veri wretch lost starv soak to the skin
with tire hors on of which wa lame thei wander about on the
lone veld onli on stroke of fortun came to them as the sun set
for a few moment it rai pierc the mist tell them in what
direct thei should go turn their hors thei head for it
and so rode on until the dark fell then thei halt a while
but feel that if thei stood still in that horribl cold thei would
certainli perish befor morn onc more push on again by now mr
clifford hors wa almost too lame to ride so he led it walk
at hi daughter side and reproach himself bitterli for hi
foolish in have brought her into thi troubl
it doesnt matter father she answer wearili for she wa veri
tire noth matter on mai as well die upon the veld as in the sea
or anywher els
on thei plod thei knew not whither benita fell asleep upon her
saddl and wa awaken onc by a hyena howl quit close to them
and onc by her hors fall to it knee
what is the time she said at last
her father struck a match and look at hi watch it wa ten oclock
thei had been fifteen hour awai from the waggon and without food at
interv mr clifford who had remount fire hi rifl now there
wa but on cartridg left and have caught sight of hi daughter

that desper wilder there wa littl hope of it bring succour
shall we stop or go on he ask
i do not care she answer onli if i stop i think it will be for
ever let us go on
now the rain had ceas but the mist wa as dens as befor also
thei seem to have got among bush for wet leav brush their face
utterli exhaust thei stumbl forward till suddenli benita felt her
hors stop as though a hand had seiz it bridl and heard a man
voic speak with a foreign accent sai
mein gott where ar you go

at thi instant the moon rose abov the mist and benita saw jacob
meyer for the first time
in that light hi appear wa not unpleas a man of about forti
year of ag not over tall slight and activ in build with a point
black beard regular semit featur a complexion of an ivori pallor
which even the african sun did not seem to tan and dark lustrou ey
that appear now to sleep and now to catch the fire of the thought
within yet weari though she wa there wa someth in the man

that to attain to them he would shrink at noth in a moment he wa

so thei began their descent of the hill meyer did not speak again
all hi attent seem to be concentr upon find a safe path on
which the hors would not stumbl nor did benita speak she wa
too utterli exhaustedso exhaust inde that she could no longer
control her mind and imagin these seem to loos themselv from
her and to acquir new power notabl that of enter into the secret
thought of the man at her side she saw them pass befor her like
live thing and yet she could not read them still someth she did
understandthat she had suddenli grown import to thi man not in
the wai in which women ar gener import to men but otherwis
she felt as though she had becom interwoven with the object of hi
life and wa henceforth necessari to their fulfil as though she
were someon whom he had been seek for year on year the on person
who could give him light in hi dark
these imagin troubl her so that she wa veri thank when thei
pass awai as swiftli as thei had arisen and she knew onli that she
wa half dead with weari and cold that her limb ach and that the
steep path seem endless
at length thei reach level ground and after travel along it for
a while and cross the bed of a stream pass through a gate and
stop suddenli at the door of a hous with light window

jacob meyer and i thank the fate which rule us that it ha taught me
to bring you to it safe

mean merit thing that she had not expect in thi faroff place also
on a tabl stood a great bowl of arum lili she wonder who had put
them there whether it were the old halfbre salli or jacob meyer
also she wonder who had paint the pictur which were all of
african sceneri and someth told her that both the flower and the
pictur came from jacob meyer
on the littl tabl by her bed wa a handbel which present she rang

six week had gone by sinc the event even of benita arriv at
rooi krantz now the spring had fulli come the veld wa emerald with
grass and bright with flower in the kloof behind the hous tree had
put out their leav and the mimosa were in bloom make the air
heavi with their scent amongst them the ringdov nest in hundr
and on the steep rock of the precipic the redneck vultur fed
their young along the bank of the stream and round the border of
the lake the piglili bloom a sheet of white all the place wa
beauti and full of life and hope noth seem dead and hopeless
except benita heart
her health had quit come back to her inde never befor had she felt
so strong and well but the veri soul had wither in her breast all
dai she thought and all night she dream of the man who in cold
blood had offer up hi life to save a helpless woman and her child
she wonder whether he would have done thi if he had heard the answer
that wa upon her lip perhap that wa why she had not been given time
to speak that answer which might have made a coward of him for noth
more had been heard of robert seymour inde alreadi the tragedi of
the ship zanzibar wa forgotten the dead had buri their dead and
sinc then wors disast had happen in the world
but benita could not buri her dead she rode about the veld she sat
by the lake and watch the wild fowl or at night heard them flight
over her in flock she listen to the coo of the dove the boom
of the bittern in the reed and the drum of the snipe high in air
she count the game trek along the ridg till her mind grew weari
she sought consol from the breast of natur and found none she
sought it in the starlit ski and oh thei were veri far awai death
reign within her who outwardli wa so fair to see
in the societi of her father inde she took pleasur for he love
her and love comfort her wound heart in that of jacob meyer also
she found interest for now her first fear of the man had di awai
and undoubtedli he wa veri interest wellbr also after a fashion
although a jew who had lost hi own faith and reject that of the
christian
he told her that he wa a german by birth that he had been sent to
england as a boi to avoid the conscript which jew dislik sinc
in soldier there is littl profit here he had becom a clerk in a
hous of south african merchant and as a consequencehav shown
all the abil of hi racewa despatch to take charg of a branch
busi in cape coloni what happen to him there benita never
discov but probabl he had shown too much abil of an obliqu
natur at ani rate hi connect with the firm termin and for
year he becam a wander smous or trader until at length he
drift into partnership with her father
whatev might have been hi past howev soon she found that he wa
an extrem abl and agreeabl man it wa he and no other who had
paint the watercolour that adorn her room and he could plai and
sing as well as he paint also as robert had told her mr meyer wa
veri wellread in subject that ar not usual studi on the veld
of south africa inde he had quit a librari of book most of them
histori or philosoph and scientif work of which he would lend
her volum fiction howev he never read for the reason he told
her that he found life itself and the mysteri and problem which
surround it so much more interest
on even when thei were walk togeth by the lake watch
the long light of sunset break and quiver upon it surfac benita
curios overcam her and she ask him boldli how it happen that
such a man as he wa content to live the life he did
in order that i mai reach a better he answer oh no not in the

materialist but monei is god in thi world miss cliffordmonei is
god
she smile and answer i fear then that he is like to prove an
invis god on the high veld mr meyer you will scarc make a

it came about that thei were shut up in thi fortress which it wa
imposs to storm and there slowli perish of starvat
when it wa known that thei were all dead the nativ who had follow

peopl would kill hi peopl also when she had spoken thu she stood a
while prai on the peak then suddenli hurl herself into the river

partner for i forgot to sai that i had told him the stori and we
determin to have a try for that great wealth you know the rest we

and much more than he had spoken of had been hand down from father to
son and that thei even knew the name of the white ladi who had kill

on enough in south africa
we ask him to allow us to enter the topmost stronghold which stand
upon the hill but he refus sai that the curs still lai upon
him and hi and that no man should enter until the ladi ferreira came
again for the rest the place wa free to us we might dig as we would
so we did dig and found some gold buri with the ancient bead and
bangl and wireabout 100 worth alsothat wa on the dai when the
young seymour came upon us and account for meyer excit for
he thought that we were on the track of the treasurew found a singl
gold coin no doubt on that had been drop by the portugues here it
is and he threw a thin piec of gold on the tabl befor her i have
shown it to a man learn in those matter and he sai that it is a
ducat struck by on of the doge of venic
well we never found ani more the end of it wa that the makalanga
caught us try to get in to the secret stronghold by stealth and gave
us the choic of clear out or be kill so we clear out for
treasur is not of much us to dead men
mr clifford ceas speak and fill hi pipe while meyer help
himself to squarefac in an absent manner as for benita she stare at
the quaint old coin which had a hole in it wonder with what scene
of terror and of bloodsh it had been connect

neither mr clifford nor hi daughter said anyth after he had gone
benita appear to occupi herself in fix the broad gold coin to a
littl swivel on her bracelet but while she did so onc more that sixth
sens of her awok within her as she had been afraid at the dinner on

cast their advanc shadow on to her soul that piec of gold seem

how could thi gold link him to her she knew notsh care not all
she knew wa that she would follow thi treasur to the edg of the
world and if need be over it if onli it brought her back to him
again

the messeng
the door open and through it came jacob meyer follow by three
nativ benita did not see or hear them her soul wa far awai there
at the head of the room clad all in white for she wore no mourn
save in her heart illumin by the rai of the lamp that hung abov
her she stood still and upright for she had risen on the face and
in her wide dark ey a look that wa veri strang to see jacob
meyer perceiv it and stop the three nativ perceiv it also
and stop there thei stood all four of them at the end of the long
sittingroom stare at the white benita and at her haunt ey
on of the nativ point with hi thin finger to her face and
whisper to the other meyer who understood their tongu caught the
whisper it wa
behold the spirit of the rock
what spirit and what rock he ask in a low voic
she who haunt bambats she whom our ey have seen answer the
man still stare at benita
benita heard the whisper and knew it wa about herself though not
on word of it did she catch with a sigh she shook herself free from
her vision and sat down in a chair close by then on by on the
messeng drew near to her and each as he came made a profound
obeis touch the floor with hi fingertip and stare at her
face but her father thei onli salut with an uplift hand she look
at them with interest and inde thei were interest in their wai
tall spare men light colour with refin mobil face here wa no
negroblood but rather that of some ancient peopl such as egyptian or
phoenician men whose forefath had been wise and civil thousand
of year ago and perchanc had stood in the court of pharaoh or of
solomon
their salut finish the three men squat in a line upon the
floor draw their fur kaross or robe about them and wait in
silenc jacob meyer thought a while then said
clifford will you translat to your daughter so that she mai be sure
she is told exactli what pass
next he turn and address the nativ
your name ar tama tamala and hoba and you tama ar the son of
the molimo of bambats who is call mambo and you tamala and hoba
ar hi initi councillor is it so
thei bow their head
good you tama tell the stori and give again your messag that thi
ladi the ladi benita mai hear it for she ha a part in the matter
we understand that she ha a part answer tama we read in her
face that she ha the greatest part doubtless it is of her that the
spirit told my father these spoken by my mouth ar the word of the
molimo my father which we have travel so far to deliv
when you two white men visit bambats four year ago you ask of
me mambo to be admit to the holi place that you might look for the
treasur there which the portugues hid in the time of my ancestor in
the sixth gener i refus to allow you to look or even to enter
the holi place becaus i am by birth the guardian of that treasur
although i know not where it li but now i am in a great strait i
have new that lobengula the usurp who is king of the matabel ha
taken offenc against me for certain reason among them that i did not
send him a suffici tribut it is report to me that he purpos
next summer to despatch an impi to wipe me and my peopl out and to
make my kraal black as the burnt veld i have littl strength to resist
him who is mighti and my peopl ar not warlik from gener to
gener thei have been trader cultiv of the land worker in
metal and men of peac who desir not to kill or be kill also thei
ar few therefor i have no power to stand against lobengula
i rememb the gun that you and your companion brought with you
which can kill thing from far awai if i had a suppli of those gun
from behind my wall i might defi the impi of lobengula whose warrior
us the assegai if you will bring me a hundr good gun and plenti of
powder and bullet for them it is reveal to me that it will be law
for me to admit you to the secret holi place where you mai look for
the buri gold for as long as you wish and if you can find it take
it all awai without hindranc from me or my peopl but i will be honest
with you that gold will never be found save by the on appoint the
white ladi said so in the time of my forefath he heard it with hi
ear and i have heard it from hi descend with my ear and so it
shall be still if you bring the gun you can come and see if either
of you is that on appoint but i do not think that ani man is so
appoint for the secret is hid in woman but of thi you can learn for
yourselv i do but speak as i am bidden
thi is my messag spoken by my mouth tama son of my bodi and my
councillor who go with him will bear wit that he speak the truth
i mambo the molimo of bambats send you greet and will give you
good welcom and fulfil my promis if you come with the farshoot
gun ten time ten of them and the powder and the bullet wherewith
i mai drive off the matabel but not otherwis my son tama and my
councillor will drive your waggon into my countri but you must bring
no strang servant the spirit of the white woman who kill herself
befor the ey of my forefath ha been seen of late stand upon the
point of rock also she ha visit me at night in my secret place where
her companion di i do not know all that thi portend but i think
that amongst other thing she wish to tell me that the matabel ar
about to attack us i await the decre of the heaven i send you two
kaross as a gift and a littl ancient gold sinc ivori is too heavi
for my messeng to carri and i have no waggon farewel
we have heard you said meyer when mr clifford had finish
translat and we wish to ask you a question what do you mean when
you sai that the spirit of the white woman ha been seen
i mean what i sai white man answer tama she wa seen by all
three of us stand upon the pinnacl at the dawn also my father saw
and spoke with her alon in hi sleep at night thi is the third time
in my father dai that she ha appear thu and alwai befor some
great event
what wa she like ask meyer
like oh like the ladi who sit yonder ye quit the same or so it
seem to us but who know we have seen no other white women and we
were not veri near let the ladi come and stand side by side with the
spirit so that we can examin them both and we shall be abl to answer
better do you accept the offer of the molimo
we will tell you tomorrow morn repli meyer a hundr rifl
ar mani to find and will cost much monei meanwhil for you there is
food and a sleepingplac
the three men seem disappoint at hi answer which thei evid
believ to be preliminari to a refus for a moment or two thei
consult togeth then tama put hi hand into a pouch and drew from
it someth wrap in dry leav which he undid reveal a quaint
and beauti necklac fashion of twist gold link wherein were
set white stone that thei had no difficulti in recognis as uncut
diamond of consider valu from thi necklac also hung a crucifix
mould in gold
we offer thi gift he said on behalf of mambo my father to the
ladi yonder to whom the kaross and the rough gold ar of no us
the chain ha a stori when the portugues ladi hurl herself into the
river she wore it about her neck as she fell into the river she struck
against a littl point of rock which tore the chain awai from herse
where it is broken and mend with gold wire it remain upon the point
of rock and my forefath took it thenc it is a gift to the ladi if
she will promis to wear it
accept it mutter mr clifford when he had finish translat
thi or you will give offenc
so benita said i thank the molimo and accept hi gift
then tama rose and advanc cast the ancient tragic thing over her
head as it fell upon her shoulder benita knew that it wa a chain of
destini draw her she knew not where thi ornament that had last been
worn by that woman bereav and unhappi as herself who could find no
refug from her sorrow except in death had she felt it torn from her
breast she wonder as she the live benita of todai felt it fall
upon her own
the three envoi rose bow and went leav them alon jacob meyer
lift hi head as though to address her then chang hi mind and wa
silent both the men wait for her to speak but she would not and in
the end it wa her father who spoke first
what do you sai benita he ask anxious
i i have noth to sai except that i have heard a veri curiou
stori thi priest messag is to you and mr meyer father and must
be answer by you what have i to do with it
a great deal i think my dear or so those men seem to believ
at ani rate i cannot go up there without you and i will not take you
there against your wish for it is a long wai off and a queer busi
the question is will you go
she thought a space while the two men watch her anxious
ye she answer at length in a quiet voic i will go if you wish
to go not becaus i want to find treasur but becaus the stori and
the countri where it happen interest me inde i dont believ much
in the treasur even if thei ar superstiti and afraid to look for
it themselv i doubt whether thei would allow you to look if thei
thought it could be found to me the journei doe not seem a good
busi specul also there ar risk
we think it good enough broke in meyer decidedli and on doe not
expect to get million without troubl
ye ye said her father but she is rightther ar risk great
risksfev wild beast savag and other that on cannot forese
have i a right to expos her to them ought we not to go alon
it would be useless answer meyer those messeng have seen your
daughter and mix her up with their superstiti stori of a ghost
of which i who know that there ar no such thing believ noth
without her now we shall certainli fail
as for the risk father said benita person i take no account
of them for i am sure that what is to happen will happen and if i knew
that i wa to die upon the zambesi it would make no differ to me
who do not care but as it chanc i thinki cannot tell you whythat
you and mr meyer ar in more danger than i am it is for you to
consid whether you will take the risk
mr clifford smile i am old he said that is my answer
and i am accustom to such thing said meyer with a shrug of hi
shoulder who would not run a littl danger for the sake of such a
gloriou chanc wealth wealth more wealth than we can dream of
and with it powerpow to aveng to reward to bui posit and
pleasur and all beauti thing which ar the heritag of the veri
rich alon and he spread out hi hand and look upward as though
in ador of thi golden god
except such trifl as health and happi comment benita not
without sarcasm for thi man and hi materi desir disgust her
somewhat especi when she contrast him with anoth man who
wa lost to her though it wa true that hi past had been idl and
unproduct enough yet thei interest her also for benita had never
met anyon like mr meyer so talent so eager and so soulless
then i understand it is settl she said
mr clifford hesit but meyer answer at onc
ye settl as far as anyth can be
she wait a moment for her father to speak but he said noth hi
chanc had gone by
veri well now we shall not need to troubl ourselv with further
doubt or argument we ar go to bambats on the zambesi a distant
place to look for buri gold and i hope mr meyer that if you find
it the result will come up to your expect and bring you all
sort of good luck goodnight father dear goodnight
my daughter think it will bring us illluck said mr clifford when
the door had close behind her that is her wai of sai so
ye answer meyer gloomili she think that and she is on of
those who have vision well she mai be wrong also the question is
shall we seiz our opportun and it danger or remain here and breed
bad hors all our live while she who is not afraid laugh at us i am
go to bambats
again mr clifford made no direct answer onli ask a question
how long will it take to get the gun and ammunit and what will
thei cost
about a week from wakkerstroom repli meyer old potgiet
the trader there ha just import a hundr martini and a hundr
westleyrichard fallingblock fifti of each with ten thousand round
of cartridg will cost about 600 and we have as much as that in the
bank also we have the new waggon and plenti of good oxen and hors
we can take a dozen of the hors with us and sell them in the north
of the transvaal for a fine price befor we get into the tetsefli
belt the oxen will probabl carri us through as thei ar most of them
salt
you have thought it all out jacob i see but it mean a lot of monei
on wai and anoth to sai noth of other thing
ye a lot of monei and those rifl ar too good for kaffir
birmingham gaspip would have done for them but there ar none to be
had but what is the monei and what ar the gun compar to all thei
will bring us
i think you had better ask my daughter jacob she seem to have her
own idea upon the subject
miss clifford ha made up her mind and it will not chang i shall ask
her no more repli meyer
then he too left the room to give order about the journei to
wakkerstroom that he must take upon the morrow but mr clifford sat
there till past midnight wonder whether he had done right and if
thei would find the treasur of which he had dream for year and what
the futur had in store for them
if onli he could have seen
when benita came to breakfast the next morn she ask where mr
meyer wa and learn that he had alreadi depart for wakkerstroom
certainli he is in earnest she said with a laugh
ye answer her father jacob is alwai in earnest though
somehow hi earnest ha not brought him much good so far if we
fail it will not be want of thought and prepar on hi part
nearli a week went by befor meyer return again and meanwhil benita
made readi for her journei in the interv of her simpl prepar
also she talk a good deal with the help of her father to the three
sturdylook makalanga who were rest thankfulli after their long
journei their convers wa gener sinc by tacit consent no
further mention wa made of the treasur or of anyth to do with it
but it enabl her to form a fair opinion of them and their peopl she
gather that although thei spoke a dialect of zulu thei had none
of the braveri of the zulu and inde live in deadli terror of the
matabel who ar bastard zulussuch terror in fact that she greatli
doubt whether the hundr rifl would be of much us to them should
thei ever be attack by that tribe
thei were what their father had been befor them agriculturist and
worker in metalsnot fight men also she set herself to learn what
she could of their tongu which she did not find difficult for benita
had a natur aptitud for languag and had never forgotten the dutch
and zulu she us to prattl as a child which now came back to her
veri fast inde she could alreadi talk fairli in either of those
languag especi as she spent her spare hour in studi their
grammar and read them
so the dai went on till on even jacob meyer appear with two
scotch cart laden with ten long box that look like coffin and
other smaller box which were veri heavi to sai noth of a multitud
of store as mr clifford prophesi he had forgotten noth for
he even brought benita variou articl of cloth and a revolv for
which she had not ask
three dai later thei trek awai from rooi krantz upon a peculiarli
beauti sundai morn in the earli spring give it out that thei
were go upon a trade and shoot expedit in the north of the
transvaal benita look back at the pretti littl stead and the wood
kloof behind it over which she had nearli fallen and the placid lake in
front of it where the nest wildfowl wheel and sigh for to her
now that she wa leav it the place seem like home and it came
into her mind that she would never see it ani more
viii
bambats
nearli four month had gone by when at length the waggon with which
were mr clifford benita and jacob meyer camp on night within the
countri of the molimo of bambats whose name wa mambo or perhap
that wa hi titl sinc accord to tama hi son everi chief in
success wa call mambo though not all of them were molimo or
repres and prophet of god or the great spirit whom thei knew
as munwali thu sometim the molimo or priest of munwali and the
mambo or chief were differ person for instanc he said that he
tama would be mambo on hi father death but no vision were given
to him therefor as yet at ani rate he wa not call to be molimo
in the cours of thi long journei thei had met with mani adventur
such as were common to african travel befor the dai of railroad
adventur with wild beast and nativ tribe adventur with swollen
river also and on that wa worst with thirst sinc for three dai
ow to the failur of a pit or pan where thei expect to find
water thei were oblig to go without drink still none of these
were veri seriou nor had ani of the three of them ever been in better
health than thei were at thi moment for by good luck thei had escap
all fever inde their rough wild life had agre with benita
extraordinarili well so well that ani who had known her in the street
of london would scarc have recogn her as the sunburnt activ and
wellform young woman who sat that night by the camp fire
all the hors thei had brought with them had been sold except some
which had di and three that were salt or proof against the
deadli hors sick which thei took on with them their own servant
also had been sent back to rooi krantz in charg of a scotch cart laden
with ivori purchas from boer hunter who had brought it down from the
north of the transvaal therefor for thi wa part of the bargain the
three makalanga were now their onli attend who drove and herd the
cattl while benita cook the food which the two white men shot or
sometim bought from nativ
for dai thei had been pass through a countri that wa practic
desert and now have cross a high nek the same on which robert
seymour had left hi waggon thei were camp in low land which as thei
could see by the remain of wall that appear everywher had onc
been extens enclos and cultiv to their right wa a rise
mountain ground beyond which said the makalanga ran the zambesi
and in front of them not more than ten mile awai a great isol
hill none other than that place that thei had journei so far to
reach bambats round which flow the great river inde thither on
of the three makalanga he who wa name hoba had gone on to announc
their approach
thei had outspan amongst ruin most of them circular in shape and
benita studi them in the bright moonlight guess that onc these
had been hous that place now so solitari hundr or thousand of
year ago wa undoubtedli the home of a great popul thousand
rather than hundr she thought sinc close at hand in the middl
of on of these round hous grew a mighti baobab tree that could not
have seen less than ten or fifteen centuri sinc the seed whenc it
sprang pierc the cement floor which wa still visibl about it giant
bole
tama the molimo son saw her studi these evid of antiqu
and approach salut her
ladi he said in hi own languag which by now she spoke veri well
ladyand he wave hi hand with a fine gesturebehold the citi of
my peopl
how do you know that it wa their citi she ask
i do not know ladi stone cannot speak the spirit ar silent and
we have forgotten still i think so and our father have told us that
but six or eight gener ago mani folk live here though it wa not
thei who built these wall even fifti year ago there were mani but
now the matabel have kill them and we ar few tomorrow you will
see how few come here and look and he led her through the entranc
of a squar cattl kraal which stood close by within were tuft of
rank grass and a few bush and among these score of skull and other
bone
the matabel kill these in the time of moselikats he said now
do you wonder that we who remain fear the matabel and desir gun to
defend ourselv from them even if we must sell our secret in order
to bui those gun who have no monei to pai for them
no she answer look at the tall dignifi man into whose soul
the iron of fear and slaveri had burnt so deep no i do not wonder
next morn at daybreak thei trek on alwai through these evid
of dead forgotten peopl thei had not more than ten mile to cover to
reach their long journei end but the road if so it could be call
ran uphil and the oxen whereof onli fourteen were now left to drag
the heavyladen waggon were thin and footsor so that their progress
wa veri slow inde it wa past middai when at length thei began to
enter what by apolog might be call the town of bambats
when we go awai from thi it will have to be by water i think unless
we can bui trekcattl said meyer look at the labour oxen with
a doubt ey
why ask mr clifford anxious
becaus sever of those beast have been bitten by tetsefli like my
hors and the poison is begin to work i thought so last night but
now i am sure look at their ey it wa down in that bit of bush veld
eight dai ago i said that we ought not to camp there
at thi moment thei came to the crest of the ridg and on it further
side saw the wonder ruin of bambats close at hand in front of
them stood a hill jut out as it were into the broad water of the
zambesi river which to a great extent protect it upon three side
the fourth that opposit to them except at on place where a kind of
natur causewai led into the town wa also defend by natur sinc
here for more than fifti feet in height the granit rock of the base of
the hill rose sheer and unclimb on the mount itself that in all
mai have cover eight or ten acr of ground and surround by a deep
donga or ditch were three ring of fortif set on abov the
other mighti wall which it wa evid had been built by no modern
hand look at them benita could well understand how it came about
that the poor fugit portugues had chosen thi as their last place of
refug and were overcom at length not by the thousand of savag who
follow and surround them but by hunger inde the place seem
impregn to ani forc that wa not arm with sieg gun
on the hither side of thi natur foss which doubtless in ancient
time had been fill with water led from the zambesi stood the villag
of the bambats makalanga a collect of seventi or eighti wretch
hut round like those of their forefath but built of mud and
thatch about them lai the garden or squar field that were well
cultiv and at thi season rich with ripen corn benita howev
could see no cattl and conclud therefor that these must be kept
on the hill for safeti and within it wall
down the rough road thei lumber and through the villag where the
few women and children stare at them in a frighten wai then thei
came to the causewai which on it further side wa block with
thorn and rough stone taken from the ruin while thei wait for
these to be remov by some men who now appear benita look at the
massiv circular wall still thirti or forti feet in height by perhap
twenti through it base built of granit block without mortar
and ornament with quaint pattern of other colour stone in
it thick she could see groov where evid had onc been
portcullis but these had disappear long ago
it is a wonder place she said to her father i am glad that i
came have you been all over it
no onli between the first and second wall and onc between the
second and third the old templ or whatev it is is on the top
and into that thei would never admit us it is there that the treasur
li
that the treasur is suppos to lie she answer with a smile but
father what guarante have you that thei will do so now perhap thei
will take the gun and show us the dooror rather the gate
your daughter is right there is none and befor a box is taken off
the waggon we must get on said meyer oh i know it is riski and it
would have been better to make sure first but it is too late to talk of
that now look the stone ar clear trek ontrek
the long waggonwhip crack the poor tiredout oxen strain at the
yoke and on thei went through the entranc of that fate fortress
that wa but just wide enough to admit them insid lai a great open
space which as thei could see from the numer ruin had onc been
fill with build that now were half hidden by grass tree and
creeper thi wa the outer ring of the templ where in ancient
dai the priest and captain had their home travel across it for
perhap a hundr and fifti yard thei came near the second wall which
wa like the first onli not quit so solid and saw that on a stretch
of beaten ground and seat in the shadow for the dai wa hot the
peopl of bambats were gather to greet them
when within fifti yard thei dismount from the hors which were
left with the waggon in the charg of the makalanga tamala then benita
take her posit between her father and jacob meyer thei
advanc toward the ring of nativ of whom there mai have been two
hundredal of them adult men
as thei came except on figur who remain seat with hi back
against the wall the human circl stood up as a token of respect and
benita saw that thei were of the same stamp as the messengerstal and
goodlook with melancholi ey and a cow express wear the
appear of peopl who from dai to dai live in dread of slaveri and
death opposit to them wa a break in the circl through which tama

wait
i do not kill envoi said the molimo but if thei ar foulmouth
i throw them out of my wall your messag men of the amandabel

noth is left of us and now he seek what we have not got to give in
order that he mai forc a quarrel upon us and murder us there is nought

now the crowd of listen makalanga trembl at hi word but in the
old molimo thei seem onli to rous a storm of prophet furi for a
moment he stood stare up at the blue sky hi arm outstretch as
though in prayer then he spoke in a new voicea clear quiet voic
that did not seem to be hi own
who am i he said i am the molimo of the bambats makalanga i am
the ladder between them and heaven i sit on the topmost bough of
the tree under which thei shelter and there in the crest of the
tree munwali speak with me what to you ar wind to me ar voic

i lift no hand against you but you shall not live to look again upon
your king face begon now and do your worst
for a moment the three matabel seem to be frighten and benita
heard on of them sai to hi companion
the wizard ha bewitch us he ha bewitch the great eleph and
all hi peopl shall we kill him
but quickli shake off hi fear their spokesman laugh and answer
so that is what you have brought the white peopl here for old
traitorto plot against the throne of lobengula
he wheel round and stare at mr clifford and jacob meyer then ad
good greybeard and blackbeard i myself will put you both to such a
death as you have never heard of and as for the girl sinc she is well
favour she shall brew the king beer and be number amongst the
king wivesunless inde he is pleas to give her to me
in an instant the thing wa done at the man word about benita
meyer who had been listen to hi threat and bombast unconcern
suddenli seem to awak hi dark ey flash hi pale face turn
cruel snatch the revolv from hi belt he seem to point and fire
it with on movement and downdead or dyingwent the matabel
men did not stir thei onli stare accustom as thei were to death in
that wild land the sudden of thi deed surpris them the contrast
between the splendid brutal savag who had stood befor them a moment
ago and the limp black thing go to sleep upon the ground wa
strang enough to move their imagin there he lai and there over
him the smoke pistol in hi hand meyer stood and laugh
benita felt that the act wa just and the aw punish deserv
yet that laugh of jacob jar upon her for in it she thought she
heard the man heart speak and oh it voic wa merciless sure
justic should not laugh when her sword fall
behold now said the molimo in hi still voic point at the dead
matabel with hi finger do i speak li or is it true that thi
man shall not look more upon hi king face well as it wa with
the servant so it shall be with the lord onli more slowli it is the
decre of the munwali spoken by the voic of hi mouth the molimo of
bambats go children of lobengula and bear with you as an offer
thi firstfruit of the harvest that the white men shall reap among the
warrior of hi peopl
the thin voic di awai and there wa silenc so intens that benita
thought she heard the scrape of the feet of a green lizard which crept
across a stone a yard or two awai
then of a sudden it end of a sudden the two remain matabel turn
and fled for their live and as when dog run a flock of sheep will
wheel about and pursu them so did the makalanga thei grab at the
messeng with their hand tear their fineri from them thei struck
them with stick thei pound them with stone till at length two
bruis and bleed men find all escap cut off and led perhap
by some instinct stagger back to where benita stood horrifi at thi
dread scene and throw themselv upon the ground clutch at her
dress and prai for merci
move a littl miss clifford said meyer three of those brute will
not weigh heavier than on upon my conscienc
no no you shall not she answer mambo these men ar messeng
spare them
hearken to the voic of piti said the old prophet spoken in a place
where piti never wa and not in vain let them go give merci to the
merciless for she bui their live with a prayer
thei will bring the other on us mutter tama and even old mr
clifford shook hi head sadli but the molimo onli said
i have spoken let them go that which will befal must befal and
from thi deed no ill shall come that would not have come otherwis
you hear depart swiftli said benita in zulu
with difficulti the two men drag themselv to their feet and
support each other stood befor her on of them a clever
powerfulfac man whose black hair wa ting with grei address
himself to benita gasp
hear me that fool there and he point to hi dead companion whose
boast brought hi death upon him wa but a low fellow i who kept
silenc and let him talk am maduna a princ of the royal hous who
justli deserv to die becaus i turn my back upon these dog yet i
and my brother here take life at your hand ladi who now that i have
had time to think would refus it at their for whether i stai or
go doe not matter the impi wait the slayer ar beneath the wall
those thing which ar decre will happen there yonder old wizard
speak true listen ladi should it chanc that you have caus to
demand two live at the hand of maduna in hi own name and the name
of hi king he promis them to you in safeti shall thei pass thei
and all that is their without toll taken rememb the oath of maduna
ladi in the hour of your need and do you my brother bear wit to
it among our peopl
then straighten themselv as well as thei were abl these two
sore hurt men lift their right arm and gave benita the salut
due to a chieftai thi done take no note of ani other creatur
there thei limp awai to the gate that had been open for them and
vanish beyond the wall
all thi while meyer had stood silent now he spoke with a bitter smile
chariti miss clifford said a certain paul as report in your new
testament cover a multitud of sin i hope veri much that it will
serv to cover our remain from the aasvogel after we have met our
death in some such fashion as that brute promis us and he point
to the dead man
benita look at her father in question
mr meyer mean my dear that you have done a foolish thing in beg
the live of those matabel it would have been safer for us if thei
were dead who as it is have gone off burn for reveng of cours
i understand it wa natur enough but and he hesit and
stop
the chief did not sai so broke in benita with agit besid if
he had i should not have care it wa bad enough to see on man kill
like that and she shiver i could not bear ani more
you should not be angri at the fellow death see that it wa what
he said of you which brought it upon him meyer repli with mean
otherwis he might have gone unharm as far as i wa concern for
the rest i did not interfer becaus i saw it wa useless also i am
a fatalist like our friend the molimo and believ in what is decre
the truth is he ad sharpli among savag ladi ar not in
place
why did you not sai that down at rooi krantz jacob ask mr
clifford you know i thought so all the while but somehow i wa
overrul now what i suggest is that we had better get out of thi
place as fast as we caninstantli as soon as we have eaten befor our
retreat is cut off
meyer look at the oxen which had been outspan nine were wander
about pick up what food thei could but the five which were suppos
to have been bitten by tetsefli had lain down
nine wornout and footsor oxen will not draw the waggon he said
also in all probabl the place is alreadi surround by matabel
who mere let us in to be sure of the gun which their spi must have
told them we were carri lastli have spent so much and come so
far i do not mean to go without what we seek still if you think that
your daughter danger is greater within these wall than outsid
of them you might try if we can hire servant which i doubt or
possibl if ani rower ar to be had you could go down the zambesi in
a cano risk the fever you and she must settl it clifford
difficulti and danger everi wai on look benita what do you sai
ask her father distractedli
benita thought a moment she wish to escap from mr meyer of whom
she wa weari and afraid and would have endur much to do so on the
other hand her father wa tire out and need rest also to turn
hi back upon thi ventur now would have been a bitter blow to him
moreov lack cattl and men how wa it to be done lastli
someth within her that same voic which had bidden her to come
seem to bid her to stai veri soon she had made up her mind
father dear she said thank you for think of me but as far as
i can see we should run more risk try to get awai than we do in
stop here i want to come though you warn me against it and
now i must take my chanc and trust to god to bring us safe through all
danger sure with all those rifl the makalanga ought to be abl to
hold such a place as thi against the matabel
i hope so answer her father but thei ar a timid folk still
though it would have been far better never to have come i think with
you that it is best to stai where we ar and trust to god
x
the mountain top
if our adventur or ani of them hope that thei were go to be
led to the secret place of the fortress that dai thei were destin
to disappoint inde the remaind of it wa emploi arduous
enough in unpack rifl and a suppli of ammunit also in give
to a few of the lead makalanga preliminari lesson in the method of
their us a matter as to which their idea were of the vaguest the
rest of the tribe have brought their women and children into the
outer enclosur of the ancient stronghold and with them their sheep
and goat and the few cattl which remain to them were emploi in
build up the entranc perman with stone a zigzag secret path
upon the river side that could be stop in a few minut be now
their onli method of ingress and egress through the thick of the
wall a certain number of men were also sent out as spi to discov
if possibl the whereabout of the matabel impi
that there wa some impi thei were almost sure for a woman who had
follow them report that the injur captain maduna and hi
companion had been met at a distanc of about three mile from bambats
by a small parti of matabel who were hide in some bush and that
these men had made litter for them and carri them awai whither she
did not know for she had not dare to pursu them further
that night benita pass in the guesthous which wa onli a hut rather
larger than the other while the two men slept in the waggon just
outsid she wa so tire that for a long while she could not rest her
mind kept fly back to all the event of the dai the strang word
of that mystic old molimo concern herself the arriv of the brutal
messeng and the indaba that follow then the sudden and aw
destruct of their spokesman at the hand of jacob meyer the scene
would not leav her ey she saw it again and yet again the quick
transform of meyer indiffer face when the soldier began to
insult and threaten her the lightninglik movement of hi hand the
flash the report the chang from life to death and the slayer cruel
laugh he could be veri terribl jacob meyer when hi passion were
rous
and what had rous them then she could not doubt that it wa
herselfnot mere chivalri toward a woman even if he were capabl of
chivalri mere for that he would never have taken such risk of futur
troubl and reveng no it wa someth deeper he had never said
anyth or done anyth yet long ago instinct or insight had caus
benita to suspect the work of hi mind and now she wa sure of
them the thought wa terriblewors than all her other danger put
togeth true she had her father to reli on but he had been somewhat
ail of late ag and these arduou journei and anxieti had told
upon him suppos that anyth were to happen to himif he di for
instanc how dread her posit might becom left alon far from
the reach of help with savagesand jacob meyer
oh if it had not been for that dread shipwreck how differ might
be her lot todai well it wa the thought of the shipwreck and of him
whom she had lost therein which had driven her on to thi adventur
that in it perhap her suffer mind might be numb to rest and now
she must face it issu god still remain abov her and she would
put her trust in him after all if she di what did it matter
but that old molimo had promis her that she wa safe from death that
she should find here happi and rest though not that of the grave
he promis thi speak as on who knew of all her grief and a veri
littl while afterward in the case of the matabel soldier he had
prove himself a prophet of aw power alsosh knew not how she
knew not whynow as befor her inmost heart seem to bear wit
that thi old dreamer word were true and that for her in some
strang manner unforeseen there still remain a rest
comfort a littl by thi intuit at length benita fell asleep
next morn when she came out of the hut benita wa met by her
father who with a cheer counten inform her that at ani rate
as yet there wa no sign of the matabel a few hour later too some
spi came in who said that for mile round noth could be seen or
heard of them still the prepar for defenc went on and the
hundr best men have been furnish with the rifl were be
drill in the us of them by tama and hi two companion tamala and
hoba who had learn how to handl a gun veri well in the cours of
their long journei the shoot of these raw recruit howev prove
to be execr inde so danger were thei that when on of them
fire at a mark set upon the wall it wa found necessari to order
all the rest to lie down as it wa a poor trek oxluckili it wa
sickand two sheep were kill
forese a scarciti of provis in the event of a sieg meyer
provid as ever had alreadi decre the death of the tetsebitten
cattl these were accordingli despatch and have been skin and
cut up their flesh wa sever into long strip to be dri in the
burn sun as biltong which secretli benita hope she might never be
call upon to eat yet the time wa to come when she would swallow that
hard tetsepoison flesh with thank
at middai after thei had eaten mr clifford and meyer went to the
molimo where he sat against the second wall and point to the men
with the gun said
we have fulfil our bargain now fulfil your lead us to the holi
place that we mai begin our search
so be it he answer follow me white peopl
then quit unattend he guid them round the inner wall till thei
came to a path of rock not more than a yard wide beneath which wa a
precipic fifti feet or so in depth that almost overhung the river thi
giddi path thei follow for about twenti pace to find that it end
in a cleft in the wall so narrow that onli on person could walk
through it at a time that it must have been the approach to the second
stronghold wa evid howev sinc it wa face on either side with
dress stone and even the foundat granit had been worn by the
human feet which had pass here for ag upon ag thi path zigzag
to and fro in the thick of the wall till it brought them final
within it circl a broad belt of steeplyris ground cover like
that below with the tumbl ruin of build amidst which grew bush
and tree
heaven send that the gold is not buri here said mr clifford
survei the scene for if it is we shall never find it
the molimo seem to guess the mean of hi word from hi face for
he answer
i think not here the besieg won thi place and camp in it for
mani week i could show you were thei built their fire and tri to
undermin the last wall within which the portugues sat about until
hunger kill them for thei could not eat their gold follow me again
so on thei went up the slope till thei came to the base of the third
wall and as befor pass round it and reach a point abov the
river but now there wa no passag onli some shallow and almost
precipit step cut from singl stone lead from the foot of the
wall to it summit more than thirti feet abov
realli said benita contempl thi peril ascent with dismai
the wai of treasur seeker ar hard i dont think i can while her
father also look at them and shook hi head
we must get a rope said meyer to the molimo angrili how can we
climb that place without on with such a gulf below
i am old but i climb it said the ag man in mild surpris sinc to
him who had trodden it all hi life it seem not difficult still
he ad i have a rope abov which i us upon dark night i will
ascend and let it down
ascend he did accordingli inde it wa a wondrou sight to see hi
wither leg scrambl from step to step as unconcernedli as though
he were go upstair no monkei could have been more agil or more
absolut impervi to the effect of height soon he vanish inor
rather throughth crest of the wall and present appear again on
the top step whenc he let down a stout hide rope remark that it
wa secur ti so anxiou wa meyer to enter the hidden place of
which he had dream so long that he scarc wait for it to reach
hi hand befor he began the climb which he accomplish safe then
sit on the top of the wall he direct mr clifford to fasten the
end of the rope round benita waist and her turn came
it wa not so bad as she expect for she wa agil and the knowledg
that the rope would prevent disast gave her confid in a veri
littl while she had grasp meyer outstretch hand and been drawn
into safeti through a kind of apertur abov the top step then the rope
wa let down again for her father who ti it about hi middl well
wa it that he did so sinc when he wa about halfwai up awkward
or perhap loss of nerveneith of them wonder in an old
mancaus hi foot to slip and had it not been for the rope which
meyer and the molimo held he would certainli have fallen into the
river some hundr of feet below as it wa he recov himself and
present arriv pant and veri pale in her relief benita kiss
him and even as she did so thought again that she had been veri near to
be left alon with jacob meyer
all well that end well my dear he said but upon my word i am
begin to wish that i had been content with the humbl profit of
horsebreed
benita made no answer it seem too late for ani us consider
of the point
clever men those ancient said meyer see and he point out
to her how by draw a heavi stone which still lai close by over the
apertur through which thei had crept the ascent of the wall could
be made absolut imposs to ani enemi sinc at it crest it wa
batten outward not inward as is usual in these ancient ruin
ye she answer we ought to feel safe enough insid here and
that as well sinc i do not feel inclin to go out again at present
then thei paus to look about them and thi wa what thei saw
the wall built like those below of unmortar block of stone
remain in a wonderfulli good state of preserv for it onli
enemi had been time the tropic rain and the growth of shrub
and tree which here and there had crack and displac the stone it
enclos all the top of the hill perhap three acr of ground and
on it at interv were plant soapston pillar each of them about
twelv feet in height and fashion at the top to a rude resembl
of a vultur mani of these column howev had been blown down or
perhap struck by lightn and lai broken upon the wall or if thei
had fallen inward at it foot but some six or eight perhap were
still stand
benita learn afterward that thei must have been place there by
the ancient phoenician or whatev peopl construct thi gigant
fortif and had someth to do with the exact record of the
differ season of the year and their subdivis by mean of the
shadow which thei cast as yet howev she did not pai much attent
to them for she wa engag in consid a more remark relic of
antiqu which stood upon the veri verg of the precipic the wall
inde be built up to it base on either side
it wa the great cone of which richard seymour had told her fifti feet
high or more such as onc wa found in the phoenician templ but in
thi case it wa not built of masonri but shape by the hand of man out
of a singl gigant granit monolith of the sort that ar sometim to
be met with in africa that thousand or million of year ago had been
left stand thu when the softer rock around it wa worn awai by time
and weather on the inner side of thi cone were easi step wherebi
it could be ascend and it top which might have been six feet in
diamet wa fashion in the shape of a cup probabl for the purpos
of act of worship and of sacrific thi extraordinari monument which
except on the river side could not be seen from below on account of
the slope of the hill lean slightli outward so that a stone drop
from it crest would fall into the water of the stream
thenc it wa said the molimo that my forefath saw the last of
the portugues the fair daughter of the great captain ferreira hurl
herself to death after she had given the gold into our keep and laid
the curs upon it until she came again so in my dream have i seen and
heard her also ay and other have seen her but these onli from by the
river far below
he paus awhil look at benita with hi queer dreami ey then
said suddenli
sai ladi do you rememb noth of that matter
now benita grew vex for the whole thing wa uncanni and jar upon
her
how can i rememb she ask who wa born not five and twenti year
ago
i do not know he answer how should i know who am but an ignor
old black man who wa born not much more than eighti year ago yet
ladi tell me for i seek your wisdom where were you born from out of
the earth or out of the heaven what you shake your head you who
do not rememb well neither do i rememb yet it is true that all
circl meet somewher and it is true that the portugues maiden said
she would come again and lastli it is true that she wa such an on
as you ar for she haunt thi place and i who have seen her sit
yonder in the moonlight know her beauti well yet mayhap she come no
more in flesh but still her spirit come for ladi out of those ey
of your i see it gaze at me come he ad abruptli let us descend
the wall for as you cannot rememb there is more to show you have no
fearth step ar easi
so thei went down without much difficulti sinc from the accumul
of rubbish and other caus the wall wa a great deal lower on thi
side and found themselv in the usual dens growth of veget and
brushwood through which ran a littl path it led them past the ruin
of build whereof the us and purpos were long sinc forgotten for
their roof had fallen in hundr or thousand of year ago to the
entranc of a cave which wa place almost at the foot of the monolith
cone but thirti or forti yard further from the circl of the wall
here the molimo bade them stai while he lit the lamp within five
minut pass and he return sai that all wa readi
be not afraid of what you mai see he ad for know white peopl
that save my forefath and myself none have enter thi place sinc
the portugues perish here nor have we who do but come hither to
prai and receiv the word of the munwali ever ventur to disturb it
as it wa so it is come ladi come she whose spirit goe with you
wa the last of your white race to pass thi door it is therefor
fit that your feet and her spirit should be the first to enter it
again
benita hung back a littl for the adventur wa eeri then determin
that she would show no fear in the presenc of thi old priest took the
thin hand he stretch out to her and walk forward with head erect
the two men began to follow her but the molimo stop them sai
not so the maiden enter first alon with me it is her hous and
should it pleas her to ask you to dwell therein so be it but first
she must visit her hous alon
nonsens said mr clifford angrili i will not have it it will
frighten her
ladi do you trust me ask the molimo
ye she answer ad father i think you had better let me go
alon i am not afraid now and it mai be wisest not to thwart him thi
is a veri strang businessnot like anyth elseand realli i think
that i had better go alon if i do not come back present you can
follow
those who break in upon the sleep of the dead should walk gentli
gentli pipe the old molimo in a singsong voic the maiden breath
is pure the maiden foot is light her breath will not offend the
dead her step will not disturb the dead white men white men anger
not the dead for the dead ar mighti and will be reveng upon you
when you ar dead soon veri soon when you ar deaddead in your
sorrow dead in your sin dead gather to that compani of the dead
who await us here
and still chant hi mystic song he led benita by the hand out of
the light onward into dark awai from life onward into the place
of death
xi
the sleeper in the cave
like everi other passag in thi old fortress the approach to the cave
wa narrow and wind presum the ancient had arrang them thu
to facilit their defenc after the third bend howev benita saw a
light ahead which flow from a nativ lamp lit in the arch entranc
at the side of thi arch wa a shellshap hollow cut in the rock
about three feet abov the floor it appear seem familiar to her
why she wa soon to learn although at the moment she did not connect
it with anyth in particular the cave beyond wa larg lofti and
not altogeth natur for it wall had evid been shape or at
ani rate trim by man probabl here the old priest had establish
their oracl or place of offer
at first benita could not see much sinc in that great cavern two lamp
of hippopotamu oil gave but littl light present howev her ey
becam accustom to the gloom and as thei advanc up it length she
perceiv that save for a skin rug upon which she guess the molimo sat
at hi solitari devot and some gourd and platter for water and
food all the front part of the place appear to be empti beyond in
it centr stood an object of some gleam metal that from it doubl
handl and roller born upon support of rock she took to be some kind
of winch and rightli for beneath it wa the mouth of a great well the
water suppli of the topmost fortif
beyond the well wa a stone altar shape like a truncat cone or
pyramid and at some distanc awai against the far wall as she dimli
discov by the lamp that stood upon the altar cut in relief upon
that wall inde a coloss cross to which vigor if rude
execut in white stone hung the imag of christ crucifi the crown
of thorn upon hi droop head now she understood whatev mai have
been the first worship to which thi place wa dedic christian
had usurp it and set up here the sacr symbol of their faith
aw enough to look upon in such surround doubtless also the
shellshap basin at the entranc had serv the worshipp in thi
underground chapel as a stoup for holi water
the molimo lift the lamp from the altar and have adjust it
wick held it up in front of the rood befor which although she wa no
cathol benita bow her head and cross herself while he watch
her curious then he lower it and she perceiv that on the
cement floor lai great number of shroud form that at first look
to her like folk asleep he step to on of them and touch it with
hi foot whereon the cloth which with it wa cover crumbl into
dust reveal beneath a white skeleton
all those sleeper rest well inde for thei had been dead at least
two hundr year there thei laymen women and children though of
the last but few some of them had ornament on their bone some were
clad in armour and by all the men were sword or spear or knive
and here and there what she took to be primit firearm certain
of them also had turn into mummi in that dry airgrotesqu and
dread object from which she gladli avert her ey
the molimo led her forward to the foot of the crucifix where upon
it lowest step and upon the cement floor immedi beneath it
respect lai two shape decor cover with shawl of some
heavi materi interwoven with gold wire for the manufactur of which
the makalanga were famou when first the portugues came into contact
with them the molimo took hold of the cloth that seem almost as
good now as on the dai when thei were woven and lift them
reveal beneath the figur of a man and woman the featur were
unrecogniz although the hair white in the man case and raven
black in that of the woman remain perfect thei had been great
peopl for order glitter upon the man breast and hi sword wa
gold hilt whilst the woman bone were adorn with costli necklac
and jewel and in her hand wa still a book bound in sheet of
silver benita took it up and look at it it wa a missal beautifulli
illumin which doubtless the poor ladi had been read when at
length she sank exhaust into the sleep of death
see the lord ferreira and hi wife said the molimo whom their
daughter laid thu befor she went to join them then at a motion from
benita he cover them up again with their golden cloth
here thei sleep he went on in hi chant voic a hundr and
fifti and three of thema hundr and fifti and three and when i dream
in thi place at night i have seen the ghost of everi on of them
aris from besid their form and come glide down the caveth
husband with the wife the child with the motherto look at me and
ask when the maiden return again to take her heritag and give them
burial
benita shudder the solemn aw of the place and scene oppress
her she began to think that she too saw those ghost
it is enough she said let us be go
so thei went and the piti agon christ upon the cross at which
she glanc from time to time over her shoulder fade to a white blot
then vanish awai in the dark through which from gener to
gener it kept it watch abov the dead those dead that in their
despair onc had cri to it for merci and bedew it feet with tear
glad oh glad wa she when she had left that haunt place behind her
and saw the wholesom light again
what have you seen ask her father and meyer in on breath as thei
note her white and frighten face
she sank upon a stone seat at the entranc of the cave and befor she
could open her lip the molimo answer for her
the maiden ha seen the dead the spirit who goe with her ha given
greet to it dead that it left so long ago the maiden ha done
rever to the white on who hang upon the cross and ask a
bless and a pardon of him as she whose spirit goe with her did
rever befor the ey of my forefath and ask a bless and a
pardon er she cast herself awai and he point to the littl golden
crucifix which hung upon benita bosom attach to the necklac which
tama the messeng had given her at rooi krantz
now he went on now the spell is broken and the sleeper must
depart to sleep elsewher enter white men enter if you dare and ask
for pardon and for bless if it mai be found and gather up the dry
bone and take the treasur that wa their if it mai be found and
conquer the curs that goe with the treasur for all save on if
you can if you can if you can rest you here maiden in the sweet
sunshin and follow me white men follow me into the dark of the dead
to seek for that which the white men love and onc more he vanish
down the passag turn now and again to beckon to them while thei
went after him as though drawn against their wish for now at the last
moment some superstiti fear spread from him to them and show
itself in their ey
to benita half faint upon the stone seat for thi experi had
shaken her to the heart it seem but a few minut though realli
the best part of an hour had gone by when her father reappear as
whitefac as she had been
where is mr meyer she ask
oh he answer he is collect all the golden ornament off those
poor bodi and tumbl their bone togeth in a corner of the cave
benita utter an exclam of horror
i know what you mean said her father but curs the fellow he
ha no rever although at first he seem almost as scare as i wa
myself he said that as we could not begin our search with all those
corps about thei had best be got out of the wai as soon as possibl
or perhap it wa becaus he is realli afraid of them and want to
prove to himself that thei ar noth more than dust benita went on
the old man to tell you the truth i wish heartili that we had left
thi busi alon i dont believ that ani good will come of it and
certainli it ha brought enough troubl alreadi that old prophet of a
molimo ha the second sight or someth like it and he doe not hide
hi opinion but keep chuckl awai in that dread place and pipe
out hi promis of ill to be
he promis me noth but good said benita with a littl smile
though i dont see how it can happen but if you dislik the thing
father why not give it up and try to escap
it is too late dear he repli passion meyer would never
come and i cant in honour leav him also i should laugh at myself
for the rest of my life and after all why should we not have the gold
if it can be found it belong to nobodi we do not get it by robberi
or murder nugget ar of no us to portugues who have been dead two
hundr year and whose heir if thei have ani it is imposs to
discov nor can it matter to them whether thei lie about singli as
thei di or were place after death or pile togeth in a corner our
fear were mere churchyard superstit which we have caught from that
ghoul of a molimo dont you agre with me
ye i suppos so answer benita though a fate mai cling to
certain thing or place perhap at ani rate i think that it is of no
us turn back now even if we had anywher to turn so we mai as well
go through with the ventur and await it end give me the waterbottl
pleas i am thirsti
a while later jacob meyer appear carri a great bundl of preciou
object wrap in on of the gold cerecloth which bundl he hid awai
behind a stone
the cave is much tidier now he said as he flick the thick dust
which had collect on them dure hi unhallow task from hi hand
and hair and garment then he drank greedili and ask
have you two made ani plan for our futur research
thei shook their head
well then i have i thought them out while i wa bonecart and
here thei ar it is no us our go down below again for on thing
the journei is too danger and take too long and for anoth we
ar safer up abov where we have plenti to do
but said benita how about thing to eat and sleep on and the
rest
simpl enough miss clifford we must get them up the kaffir will
bring them to the foot of the third wall and we will haul them to it
top with a rope of water it seem there is plenti in that well which
is fed by a spring a hundr and fifti feet down and the old chain
is still on the roller so we onli need a coupl of bucket from the
waggon of wood for cook there is plenti also grow on the spot
and we can camp in the cave or outsid of it as we like accord to
the state of the weather now do you rest here while i go down i will
be back in an hour with some of the gear and then you must help me
so he went and the end of it wa that befor nightfal thei had enough
thing for their immedi need and by the second night work
veri hard were more or less comfort establish in their strang
habit the canva flap from the waggon wa arrang as a tent for
benita the men sleep beneath a thickleav tree near by close at
hand under anoth tree wa their cook place the provis of all
sort includ a coupl of case of squarefac and a larg suppli
of biltong from the slaughter cattl thei store with a quantiti of
ammunit in the mouth of the cave fresh meat also wa brought to
them daili and haul up in basketsthat is until there wa none
to bringand with it grain for bread and green meali to serv as
veget therefor as the water from the well prove to be excel
and quit access thei were soon set up in all thing necessari and
to these thei ad from time to time as opportun offer
in all these prepar the old molimo took a part nor when thei
were complet did he show ani inclin to leav them in the
morn he would descend to hi peopl below but befor nightfal he
alwai return to the cave where for mani year it had been hi custom
to sleepat ani rate sever time a week in the gruesom compani of
the dead portugues jacob meyer persuad mr clifford that hi object
wa to spy upon them and talk of turn him out but benita between
whom and the old man had sprung up a curiou friendship and sympathi
prevent it point out that thei were much safer with the molimo
as a kind of hostag than thei could be without him also that hi
knowledg of the place and of other thing might prove of great help
to them so in the end he wa allow to remain as inde he had a
perfect right to do
all thi while there wa no sign of ani attack by the matabel inde
the fear of such a thing wa to some extent dy awai and benita
watch from the top of the wall could see that their nine remain
oxen togeth with the two horsesfor that belong to jacob meyer
had diedand the makalanga goat and sheep were daili driven out to
graze also that the women were work in the crop upon the fertil
soil around the lowest wall still a strict watch wa kept and at
night everyon slept within the fortif moreov the drill
of the men and their instruct in the us of firearm went on
continu under tama who now in hi father old ag wa the
virtual chief of the peopl
it wa on the fourth morn that at length all their prepar
be complet the actual search for the treasur began first
the molimo wa close interrog as to it whereabout sinc thei
thought that even if he did not know thi exactli some tradit of
the fact might have descend to him from hi ancestor but he declar
with earnest that he knew noth save that the portugues maiden
had said that it wa hidden nor he ad had ani dream or vision come
to him concern thi matter in which he took no interest if it wa
there it wa there if it wa not there it wa not thereit remain
for the white men to search and see
for no veri good reason meyer had conclud that the gold must have been
conceal in or about the cave so here it wa that thei began their
investig
first thei bethought them of the well into which it might possibl
have been thrown but the fact of thi matter prove veri difficult
to ascertain ty a piec of metalit wa an old portugues
swordhiltto a string thei let it down and found that it touch
water at a depth of on hundr and twenti feet and bottom at a depth
of on hundr and fortyseven feet therefor there were twentyseven
feet of water weight a bucket thei sank it until it rest upon thi
bottom then wound it up again sever time on the third occas it
brought up a human bone and a wire anklet of pure gold but thi prove
noth except that some ancient perhap thousand of year ago had
been thrown or had fallen into the well
still unsatisfi jacob meyer who wa a most intrepid person
determin to investig the place himself a task of no littl
difficulti and danger sinc proper ladder were want nor had thei
exist wa there anyth to stand them on therefor it came to thi
a seat must be rig on to the end of the old copper chain and be
lower into the pit after the fashion of the bucket but as benita
point out although thei might let him down it wa possibl that thei
would not be abl to draw him up again in which case hi plight must
prove unfortun so when the seat had been prepar an experi
wa made with a stone weigh approxim as much as a man thi
benita and her father let down easili enough but as thei anticip
when it came to wind it up again their strength wa bare
suffici to the task three peopl could do it well but with two the
thing wa riski now meyer askedor rather commandedth molimo to
order some of hi men to help him but thi the old chief refus point
blank to do
first he made a number of excus thei were all emploi in drill
and in watch for the matabel thei were afraid to ventur here and
so forth at last meyer grew furiou hi ey flash he ground hi
teeth and began to threaten
white man said the molimo when he had done it cannot be i have
fulfil my bargain with you search for the gold find it and take it
awai if you can but thi place is holi none of my tribe save he who
hold the offic of molimo for the time mai set a foot therein kill
me if you willi care not but so it is and if you kill me afterward
thei will kill you
now meyer see that noth wa to be gain by violenc chang hi
tone and ask if he himself would help them
i am old my strength is small he repli yet i will put my hand to
the chain and do my best but if i were you i would not descend that
pit
still i will descend it and tomorrow said meyer
xii
the begin of the search
accordingli on the next dai the great experi wa made the
chain and ancient wind gear had been test and prove to be ampli
suffici to the strain therefor noth remain save for meyer
to place himself in the wooden seat with an oillamp and in case thi
should be extinguish match and candl of both of which thei had a
larg suppli
he did so boldli enough and swung out over the mouth of the pit while
the three of them clutch the handl of the winch then thei began to
lower and slowli hi white face disappear into the black depth at
everi few turn hi descent wa stop that he might examin the wall
of the well and when he wa about fifti feet down he call to them to
hold on which thei did listen while he struck at the rock with a
hammer for here it sound veri hollow
at length he shout to them to lower awai again and thei obei until
nearli all the chain wa out and thei knew he must be near the water
now benita peep over the edg saw that the star of light had
vanish hi lamp wa out nor did he appear to attempt to relight it
thei shout down the well to him but no answer come began to wind
up as fast as thei were abl it wa all that their unit strength
could manag and veri exhaust were thei when at length jacob
reappear at the top at first from the look of him thei thought that
he wa dead and had he not ti himself to the chain dead he certainli
would have been for evid hi sens had left him long ago inde
he had fallen almost out of the seat over which hi leg hung limpli
hi weight be support by the hide rope beneath hi arm which wa
made fast to the chain
thei swung him in and dash water over hi face till to their relief
at last he began to gasp for breath and reviv suffici to enabl
them to halflead and halfcarri him out into the fresh air
what happen to you ask clifford
poison with gase i suppos meyer answer with a groan for
hi head wa ach sadli the air is often bad at the bottom of deep
well but i could smell or feel noth until suddenli my sens left
me it wa a near thinga veri near thing
afterward when he had recov a littl he told them that at on
spot deep down in the well on the river side of it he found a place
where it look as though the rock had been cut awai for a space of
about six feet by four and afterward built up again with anoth sort
of stone set in hard mortar or cement immedi beneath too were
sockethol in which the end of beam still remain suggest that
here had been a floor or platform it wa while he wa examin these
rot beam that insens overcam him he ad that he thought
that thi might be the entranc to the place where the gold wa hidden
if so said mr clifford hidden it must remain sinc it can have no
better guardian than bad air also floor like that ar common in all
well to prevent rubbish from fall into the water and the stonework
you saw probabl wa onli put there by the ancient to mend a fault in
the rock and prevent the wall from cave in
i hope so said meyer sinc unless that atmospher purifi a good
deal i dont think that even i dare go down again and until on get
there of that it is difficult to be sure though of cours a lantern on
a string will tell on someth
thi wa the end of their first attempt the search wa not renew
until the follow afternoon when meyer had recov a littl from
the effect of the poison and the chafe of the hide rope beneath
hi arm inde from the former he never did quit recov sinc
thenceforward benita who for her own reason watch the man close
discov a mark and progress chang in hi demeanour hitherto he
had appear to be a reserv man on who kept tight hand upon himself
and if she knew certain thing about him it wa rather becaus she
guess or deduc them than becaus he allow them to be seen on
two occas onli had he shown hi heart befor herwhen thei had
spoken togeth by the shore of lake chrissi on the dai of the arriv
of the messeng and he declar hi ardent desir for wealth and
power and quit recent when he kill the matabel envoi yet she
felt certain that thi heart of hi wa veri passion and insurg
that hi calm wa like the ic that hide the stream beneath which it
current run fierc none can see whither the fashion in which hi
dark ey would flash even when hi pale counten remain unmov
told her so as did other thing
for instanc when he wa recov from hi swoon the first word
that pass hi lip were in german of which she understood a littl
and she thought that thei shape themselv to her name coupl with
endear epithet from that time forward he becam less guardedor
rather it seem as though he were gradual lose power to control
himself he would grow excit without appar caus and begin to
declaim as to what he would do when he had found the gold how he would
pai the world back all it had caus him to sufferhow he would becom
a king
i am afraid that you will find that exalt posit rather lone
said benita with a careless laugh and next minut wa sorri that she
had spoken for he answer look at her in a wai that she did not
like
oh no there will be a queena beauti queen whom i shall endow
with wealth and deck with jewel and surround with love and worship
what a fortun ladi she said still laugh but take the
opportun to go awai upon some errand
at other time especi after dark he would walk up and down in
front of the cave mutter to himself or sing wild old german
song in hi rich voic also he made a habit of ascend the granit
pillar and seat himself there and more than onc call down to
her to come up and share hi throne still these outbreak were so
occasion that her father whose percept appear to benita to be
less keen than formerli scarc notic them and for the rest hi
demeanour wa what it had alwai been
further research into the well be out of the question their next
step wa to make a thorough inspect of the chapelcav itself thei
examin the wall inch by inch tap them with a hammer to hear if
thei sound hollow but without result thei examin the altar but it
prove to be a solid mass of rock by the help of a littl ladder thei
had made thei examin the crucifix and discov that the white
figur on the cross had evid been fashion out of some heathen
statu of soft limeston for at it back were the remain of draperi
and long hair which the artist had not thought it necessari to cut awai
also thei found that the arm had been ad and were of a slightli
differ stone and that the weight of the figur wa taken partli by
an iron stapl which support the bodi and partli by strong copper
wire twist to resembl cord and paint white which wa pass round
the wrist and support the arm thi wire ran through loop of rock
cut in the travers of the cross that itself wa onli rais in relief
by chisel awai the solid stone behind
curious enough thi part of the search wa left to mr clifford and
benita sinc it wa on that jacob meyer seem reluct to undertak
a jew by birth and a man who openli profess hi want of belief in
that or ani other religion he yet seem to fear thi symbol of the
christian faith speak of it as horribl and unlucki ye he who
without qualm or remors had rob and desecr the dead that
lai about it feet well the crucifix told them noth but as mr
clifford lantern in hand descend the ladder which benita held
jacob meyer who wa in front of the altar call to them excitedli
that he had found someth
then it is more than we have said mr clifford as he laid down the
ladder and hurri to him
meyer wa sound the floor with a staff of woodan oper which he
had onli just began after the wall prove barren
listen now he said let the heavi staff drop a few pace to the
right of the altar where it produc the hard metal clang that
come from solid stone when struck then he move to the front of the
altar and drop it again but now the note wa hollow and reverber
again and again he repeat the experi till thei had exactli
map out where the solid rock end and that which seem to be hollow
begana space of about eight feet squar
weve got it he said triumphantli that the entranc to the place
where the gold is and the other were inclin to agre with him
now it remain to put their theori to the proofa task of no small
difficulti inde it took them three dai of hard continu work
it will be rememb that the floor of the cave wa cement over and
first of all thi cement which prove to be of excel qualiti be
larg compos of powder granit must be broken up by the help
of a steel crowbar which thei had brought with them in the waggon
at length that part of their task wa complet reveal the rock
beneath by thi time benita wa confid that whatev might lie
below it wa not the treasur sinc it wa evid that the poor
dy portugues would not have had the time or the strength to cement
it over when she told the other so howev meyer convinc that
he wa on the right tack answer that doubtless it wa done by the
makalanga after the portugues dai as it wa well known that thei
retain a knowledg of the build art of their forefath until
quit a recent period when the matabel began to kill them out
when at length the cement wa clear awai and the area swept thei
discoveredfor there ran the line of itthat here a great stone wa
set into the floor it must have weigh sever ton as it wa set in
cement howev to lift it even if thei had the strength to work the
necessari lever prove quit imposs there remain onli on thing
to be doneto cut a wai through when thei had work at thi task for
sever hour and onli succeed in make a hole six inch deep
mr clifford whose old bone ach and whose hand were veri
sore suggest that perhap thei might break it up with gunpowd
accordingli a pound flask of that explos wa pour into the hole
which thei close over with wet clai and a heavi rock leav a
quill through which ran an extempor fuse of cotton wick all be
prepar their fuse wa lit and thei left the cave and wait
five minut afterward the dull sound of an explos reach their
ear but more than an hour went by befor the smoke and fume would
allow them to enter the place and then it wa to find that the result
did not equal their expect to begin with the slab wa onli
crackednot shatter sinc the strength of the powder had been
expend upward not downward as would have happen in the case of
dynamit of which thei had none moreov either the heavi stone
which thei had place upon it strike the roof of the cave or the
concuss of the air had brought down mani ton of rock and caus
wide and dangerouslook crack also though she said noth of it
it seem to benita that the great white statu on the cross wa lean
a littl further forward than it us to do so the net result of the
experi wa that thei were oblig to drag awai great fragment of
the fallen roof that lai upon the stone which remain almost as solid
and obdur as befor
so there wa noth for it but to go on work with the crowbar at
length toward the even of the third dai of their labour when the
two men were utterli tire out a hole wa broken through demonstr
the fact that beneath thi cover lai a hollow of some sort mr
clifford to sai noth of benita who wa heartili weari of the
busi wish to postpon proceed till the morrow but jacob
meyer would not so thei toil on until about eleven oclock at night
when at length the apertur wa of suffici size to admit a man now
as in the case of the well thei let down a stone ti to a string to
find that the place beneath wa not more than eight feet deep then to
ascertain the condit of the air a candl wa lower which at first
went out but present burnt well enough thi point settl thei
brought their ladder wherebi jacob descend with a lantern
in anoth minut thei heard the sound of guttur german oath rise
through the hole mr clifford ask what wa the matter and receiv
the repli that the place wa a tomb with noth in it but an accurs
dead monk inform at which benita could not help burst into
laughter
the end of it wa that both she and her father went down also and
there sure enough lai the remain of the old missionari in hi cowl
with an ivori crucifix about hi neck and on hi breast a scroll
state that he marco born at lisbon in 1438 had di at bambats in
the year 1503 have labour in the empir of monomotapa for seventeen
year and suffer great hardship and brought mani soul to christ
the scroll ad that it wa he who befor he enter into religion wa
a sculptor by trade that had fashion the figur on the cross in thi
chapel out of that of the heathen goddess which had stood in the same
place from unknown antiqu it end with a request address to all
good christian in latin that thei who soon must be as he wa would
prai for hi soul and not disturb hi bone which rest here in the
hope of a bless resurrect
when thi piou wish wa translat to jacob meyer by mr clifford who
still retain some recollect of the classic which he had painfulli
acquir at eton and oxford the jew could scarc contain hi wrath
inde look at hi bleed hand instead of prai for the soul
of that excel missionari to reach whose remain he had labour
with such arduou incess toil he curs it wherev it might be
and unceremoni swept the bone which the document ask him not to
disturb into a corner of the tomb in order to ascertain whether there
wa not perhap some stair beneath them
realli mr meyer said benita who in spite of the solemn of the
surround could not control her sens of humour if you ar not
care the ghost of all these peopl will haunt you
let them haunt me if thei can he answer furious i dont believ
in ghost and defi them all
at thi moment look up benita saw a figur glide out of the
dark into the ring of light so silent that she start for it
might well have been on of those ghost in whom jacob meyer did not
believ in fact howev it wa the old molimo who had a habit of
come upon them thu
what sai the white man he ask of benita while hi dreami ey
wander over the three of them and the hole in the violat tomb
he sai that he doe not believ in spirit and that he defi them
she answer
the white goldseek doe not believ in spirit and he defi them
mambo repeat in hi singsong voic he doe not believ in the
spirit that i see all around me now the angri spirit of the dead
who speak togeth of where he shall lie and of what shall happen to
him when he is dead and of how thei will welcom on who disturb their
rest and defi and curs them in hi search for the rich which he
love there is on stand by him now dress in a brown robe with a
dead man cut in ivori like to that and he point to the crucifix in
jacob hand and he hold the ivori man abov him and threaten him
with sleepless centuri of sorrow when he is also on of those spirit
in which he doe not believ
then meyer rage blaze out he turn upon the molimo and revil
him in hi own tongu sai that he knew well where the treasur wa
hidden and that if he did not point it out he would kill him and send
him to hi friend the spirit so savag and evil did he look that
benita retreat a littl wai while mr clifford strove in vain to calm
him but although meyer laid hi hand upon the knife in hi belt and
advanc upon him the old molimo neither budg an inch nor show the
slightest fear
let him rave on he said when at length meyer paus exhaust just
so in a time of storm the lightn flash and the thunder peal and
the water foam down the face of rock but then come the sun again and
the hill is as it ha ever been onli the storm is spent and lost i
am the rock he is but the wind the fire and the rain it is not
permit that he should hurt me and those spirit in whom he doe not
believ treasur up hi curs to let them fall again like stone upon
hi head
then with a contemptu glanc at jacob the old man turn and glide
back into the dark out of which he had appear

benita plan escap
the next morn while she wa cook breakfast benita saw jacob
meyer seat upon a rock at a littl distanc sullen and disconsol
hi chin wa rest on hi hand and he watch her intent never
take hi ey from her face she felt that he wa concentr hi
will upon her that some new idea concern her had come into hi
mind for it wa on of her miseri that she possess the power of
interpret the drift of thi man thought much as she detest him
there exist that curiou link between them
it mai be rememb that on the night when thei first met at the crest
of leopard kloof jacob had call her a thoughtsend and some
knowledg of their mental intimaci had come home to benita from that
dai forward her chief desir had been to shut a door between their
natur to isol herself from him and him from her yet the attempt
wa never entir success
fear and disgust took hold of her bend there abov the fire all
the while awar of the jew dark ey that search her through and
through benita form a sudden determin she would implor her
father to come awai with her
of cours such an attempt would be terribl danger of the matabel
noth had been seen but thei might be about and even if enough
cattl could be collect to draw the waggon it belong to meyer as
much as to her father and must therefor be left for him still there
remain the two hors which the molimo had told her were well and
get fat
at thi moment meyer rose and began to speak to her
what ar you think of miss clifford he ask in hi soft foreign
voic
she start but answer readili enough
of the wood which is green and the kid cutlet which ar get
smoke ar you not tire of kid mr meyer she went on
he wave the question asid you ar so goodoh i mean itso realli
good that you should not tell stori even about small thing the wood
is not green i cut it myself from a dead tree and the meat is not
smoke nor were you think of either you were think of me as i
wa think of you but what exactli wa in your mind thi time i do
not know and that is why i ask you to tell me
realli mr meyer she answer flush my mind is my own
properti
ah do you sai so now i hold otherwisethat it is my properti as
mine is your a gift that natur ha given to each of us
i seek no such gift she answer but even then much as she would
have wish to do so she could not utter a falsehood and deni thi
horribl and secret intimaci
i am sorri for that as i think it veri preciou more preciou even
than the gold which we cannot find for miss clifford it bring me
nearer you
she turn upon him but he held up hi hand and went on
oh do not be angri with me and do not fear that i am go to troubl
you with soft speech for i shall not unless a time should come as
i think that perhap it will when you mai wish to listen to them but i
want to point out someth to you miss clifford is it not a wonder
thing that our mind should be so in tune and is there not an object
in all thi did i believ as you do i should sai that it wa heaven
work in usno do not answer that the work come from lower down
i take no credit for read that upon your lip the retort is too
easi and obviou i am content to sai howev that the work is that
of instinct and natur or if you will of fate point out a road by
which togeth we might travel to great end
i travel my road alon mr meyer
i know i know and that is the piti of it the troubl between man and
woman is that not in on case out of a million even if thei be lover
do thei understand each other their ey mai seek on anoth their
hand and lip mai meet and yet thei remain distinct apart and often
antagonist there is no commun of the soul but when it chanc
to be hewn from the same rock as it wereoh then what happi mai be
their and what opportun
possibl mr meyer but to be frank the question doe not interest
me
not yet but i am sure that on dai it will meanwhil i ow you an
apolog i lost my temper befor you last night well do not judg me
hardli for i wa utterli worn out and that old idiot vex me with hi
talk about ghost in which i do not believ
then why did it make you so angri sure you could have afford to
treat it with contempt instead of doinga you did
upon my word i dont know but i suppos most of us ar afraid lest we
should be forc to accept that which we refus thi ancient place get
upon the nerv miss clifford your as well as mine i can afford
to be open about it becaus i know that you know think of it
associ all the crime that ha been commit here for ag and
ag all the suffer that ha been endur here doubtless human
sacrific were offer in thi cave or outsid of it that great burnt
ring in the rock there mai have been where thei built the fire and
then those portugues starv to death slowli starv to death while
thousand of savag watch them die have you ever thought what it
mean but of cours you have for like myself you ar curs with
imagin god in heaven is it wonder that it get upon the
nerv especi when on cannot find what on is look for that
vast treasureand hi face becam ecstaticthat shall yet be your
and mine and make us great and happi
but which at present onli make me a scullerymaid and most unhappi
repli benita cheerfulli for she heard her father footstep dont
talk ani more of the treasur mr meyer or we shall quarrel we have
enough of that dure busi hour when we ar hunt for it you
know give me the dish will you thi meat is cook at last
still benita could not be rid of that treasur sinc after breakfast
the endless unprofit search began again onc more the cave wa
sound and other hollow place were discov upon which the two men
got to work with infinit labour three of them were broken into in as
mani dai and like the first found to be grave onli thi time of
ancient who perhap had di befor christ wa born there thei lai
upon their side their bone burnt by the hot cement that had been
pour over them their goldhead and goldferrul rod of offic in
their hand their goldcov pillow of wood such as the egyptian
us beneath their skull gold bracelet upon their arm and ankl
cake of gold beneath them which had fallen from the rot pouch that
onc hung about their waist vase of fine glaze potteri that had
been fill with offer or in some case with gold dust to pai the
expens of their journei in the other world stand round them and
so forth
in their wai these discoveri were rich enoughfrom on tomb alon
thei took over a hundr and thirti ounc of goldto sai noth of
their surpass archolog interest still thei were not what
thei sought all that gather wealth of monomotapa which the flee
portugues had brought with them and buri in thi their last
stronghold
benita ceas to take the slightest interest in the matter she would
not even be at the pain to go to look at the third skeleton although
it wa that of a man who had been almost a giant and to judg from the
amount of bullion which he took to the tomb with him a person of
great import in hi dai she felt as though she wish never to see
anoth human bone or ancient bead or bangl the sight of a street
in bayswat in a london fogy or a toyshop window in westbourn
grovewould have pleas her a hundr time better than these uniqu
remain that had thei known of them in those dai would have sent half
the learn societi of europ crazi with delight she wish to escap
from bambats it wondrou fortif it mysteri cone it
cave it dead andfrom jacob meyer
benita stood upon the top of her prison wall and look with long at
the wide open land below she even dare to climb the stair which
ran up the mighti cone of granit and seat herself in the cuplik
depress on it crest whenc jacob meyer had call to her to come
and share hi throne it wa a dizzi place for the pillar lean
outward it point stood almost clear of the waterscarp rock so
that beneath her wa a sheer drop of about four hundr feet to the
zambesi bed at first the great height made her feel faint her ey
swam and unpleas tremor crept along her spine so that she wa glad
to sink to the floor whenc she knew she could not fall by degre
howev she recov her nerv and wa abl to studi the gloriou
view of stream and marsh and hill beyond
for she had come here with a purpos to see whether it would not be
possibl to escap down the river in a cano or in nativ boat such as
the makalanga own and us for fish or to cross from bank to bank
appar it wa imposs for although the river beneath and
abov them wa still enough about a mile below began a cataract that
stretch as far as she could see and wa border on either side by
rocki hill cover with forest over which even if thei could obtain
porter a cano could not be carri thi inde she had alreadi
heard from the molimo but know hi timid natur she wish to judg
of the matter for herself it came to thi then if thei were to go it
must be on the hors
descend the cone benita went to find her father to whom as yet she
had said noth of her plan the opportun wa good for she knew
that he would be alon as it chanc on that afternoon meyer had gone
down the hill in order to try to persuad the makalanga to give them
ten or twenti men to help them in their excav in thi it will
be rememb he had alreadi fail so far as the molimo wa concern
but he wa not a man easili turn from hi purpos and he thought that
if he could see tama and some of the other captain he might be abl
by briberi threat or otherwis to induc them to forget their
superstiti fear and help in the search as a matter of fact he wa
utterli unsuccess sinc on and all thei declar that for them to
enter that sacr place would mean their death and that the vengeanc
of heaven would fall upon their tribe and destroi it root and branch
mr clifford on whom all thi heavi labour had begun to tell wa
take advantag of the absenc of hi taskmast jacob to sleep
awhil in the hut which thei had now built for themselv beneath the
shadow of the baobabtre as she reach it he came out yawn and
ask her where she had been benita told him
a giddi place he said i have never ventur to try it myself what
did you go up there for dear
to look at the river while mr meyer wa awai father for if he had
seen me do so he would have guess my reason inde i dare sai that
he will guess it now
what reason benita
to see whether it would not be possibl to escap down it in a boat
but there is no chanc it is all rapid below with hill and rock and
tree on either bank
what need have you to escap at present he ask ey her
curious
everi need she answer with passion i hate thi place it is a
prison and i loath the veri name of treasur also and she paus
also what dear
also and her voic sank to a whisper as though she fear that he
should overhear her even at the bottom of the hill also i am afraid
of mr meyer
thi confess did not seem to surpris her father who mere nod
hi head and said
go on
father i think that he is go mad and it is not pleasant for us to
be coop up here alon with a madman especi when he ha begun to
speak to me as he doe now
you dont mean that he ha been impertin to you said the old man
flush up for if so
no not impertinenta yet and she told him what had pass between
meyer and herself ad you see father i detest thi man inde
i want to have noth to do with ani man for me all that is over and
done with and she gave a dry littl sob which appear to come from
her veri heart and yet he seem to be get some kind of power over
me he follow me about with hi ey pry into my mind and i feel
that he is begin to be abl to read it i can bear no more father
father for god sake take me awai from thi hate hill and it gold
and it dead and let us get out into the veld again togeth
i should be glad enough dearest he answer i have had plenti of
thi wildgoos chase which i wa so mad as to be led into by the love
of wealth inde i am begin to believ that if it goe on much
longer i shall leav my bone here
and if such a dread thing as that were to happen what would becom
of me alon with jacob meyer she ask quietli i might even be
driven to the same fate as that poor girl two hundr year ago and
she point to the cone of rock behind her
for heaven sake dont talk like that he broke in
why not on must face thing and it would be better than jacob meyer
for who would protect me here
mr clifford walk up and down for a few minut while hi daughter
watch him anxious
i can see no plan he said stop opposit her we cannot take the
waggon even if there ar enough oxen left to draw it for it is hi
as much as mine and i am sure that he will never leav thi treasur
unless he is driven awai
and i am sure i hope that he will not but father the hors ar our
own it wa hi that di you rememb we can ride awai on them
he stare at her and answer
ye we could ride awai to our death suppos thei got sick or lame
suppos we meet the matabel or could find no game to shoot suppos
on of us fell illoh and a hundr thing what then
why then it is just as well to perish in the wilder as here where
our risk ar almost as great we must take our chanc and trust
to god perhap he will be merci and help us listen now father
tomorrow is sundai when you and i do no work that we can help mr
meyer is a jew and he wont wast sundai well now i will sai that i
want to go down to the outer wall to fetch some cloth which i left
in the waggon and to take other for the nativ women to wash and
of cours you will come with me perhap he will be deceiv and stai
behind especi as he ha been there todai then we can get the
hors and gun and ammunit and anyth els that we can carri in
the wai of food and persuad the old molimo to open the gate for us
you know the littl side gate that cannot be seen from up here and
befor mr meyer miss us and come to look we shall be twenti mile
awai andhors cant be overtaken by a man on foot
he will sai that we have desert him and that will be true
you can leav a letter with the molimo explain that it wa my fault
that i wa get ill and thought that i should die and that you knew
it would not be fair to ask him to come and so to lose the treasur
to everi halfpenni of which he is welcom when it is found oh father
dont hesit ani longer sai that you will take me awai from mr
meyer
so be it then answer mr clifford and as he spoke hear a
sound thei look up and saw jacob approach them
luckili he wa so occupi with hi own thought that he never note the
guilti air upon their face and thei had time to compos themselv a
littl but even thu hi suspicion were arous
what ar you talk of so earnestli he ask
we were wonder how you were get on with the makalanga answer
benita fib boldli and whether you would persuad them to face the
ghost did you

my own share and your too i suppos and he turn with a shrug of
hi shoulder

the flight
the next morn sundai meyer went to work on hi new plan what it
wa benita did not troubl to inquir but she gather that it had
someth to do with the measur out of the chapel cave into squar
for the more systemat investig of each area at twelv oclock he
emerg for hi middai meal in the cours of which he remark that it
wa veri dreari work in that place alon and that he would be glad
when it wa mondai and thei could accompani him hi word evid
disturb mr clifford not a littl and even excit some compunct
in the breast of benita
what would hi feel be she wonder when he found that thei
had run awai leav him to deal with their joint undertak
singlehand almost wa she mind to tell him the whole truth
yetand thi wa a curiou evid of the man ascend over
hersh did not perhap she felt that to do so would be to put an end
to their scheme sinc then by argument blandish threat forc
or appeal to their sens of loyalti it matter not which he would
bring about it abandon but she want to fulfil that scheme to
be free of bambats it immemori ruin it graveyard cave and
the ghoul jacob meyer who could delv among dead bone and in live
heart with equal skill and insight and yet wa unabl to find the
treasur that lai beneath either of them
so thei hid the truth and talk with feverish activ about other
thing such as the drill of the makalanga and the chanc of an
attack by the matabel which happili now seem to be grow small
also of the condit of their cattl and the prospect of obtain
more to replac those that had di inde benita went farther in her
newfound zeal of decept she proceed to act a lie ye even with
her father reproach ey fix upon her incident she mention
that thei were go to have an out to climb down the ladder and
visit the makalanga camp between the first and second wall and mix with
the great world for a few hour also to carri their wash to be done
there and bring up some clean cloth and certain book which she had
left below
jacob came out of hi thought and calcul and listen gloomili
i have half a mind to come with you he said word at which benita
shiver it certainli is most curs lonesom in that cave and i seem
to hear thing in it as though those old bone were rattl sound
like sigh and whisper too which ar made by the draught
well why dont you ask benita
it wa a bold stroke but it succeed if he had ani doubt thei
vanish and he answer at onc
becaus i have not the time we have to get thi busi finish on
wai or anoth befor the wet season come on and we ar drown out of
the place with rain or rot by fever take your afternoon out miss
clifford everi maid of all work is entitl to as much and i am afraid
that is your billet here onli he ad with that care for her safeti
which he alwai show in hi more temper mood prai be care
clifford to get back befor sundown that wall is too riski for your
daughter to climb in the dusk call me from the foot of it you have the
whistl and i will come down to help her up i think ill go with you
after all no i wont i made myself so unpleas to them yesterdai
that those makalanga cant wish to see ani more of me at present i hope
you will have a more agreeabl afternoon than i shall why dont you
take a ride outsid the wall your hors ar fat and want exercis and
i do not think that you need be afraid of the matabel then without
wait for an answer he rose and left them
mr clifford look after him doubtfulli
oh i know said benita it seem horribl mean but on must do
shabbi thing sometim here ar the bundl all readi so let us be
off
accordingli thei went and from the top of the wall benita glanc back
to bid goodby to that place which she hope never to see again yet she
could not feel as though she look her last upon it to her it wore
no air of farewel and even as she descend the peril stair she
found herself make mental note as to how thei might best be climb
again also she could not believ that she had done with mr meyer it
seem to her as though for a long while yet her futur would be full of
him
thei reach the outer fortif in safeti and there were greet
with some surpris but with no displeasur by the makalanga whom thei
found still drill with the rifl in the us of which a certain
number of them appear to have becom fairli profici go to
the hut in which the spare good from the waggon had been store thei
quickli made their prepar here also mr clifford wrote a letter
on of the most unpleas that he had ever been call upon to compos
it ran thu
dear meyer
i dont know what you will think of us but we ar escap from thi
place the truth is that i am not well and my daughter can bear it no
longer she sai that if she stop here she will die and that hunt
for treasur in that ghastli graveyard is shatter her nerv i
should have like to tell you but she beg me not be convinc
that if i did you would overpersuad us or stop us in some wai as for
the gold if you can find it take it all i renounc my share we ar
leav you the waggon and the oxen and start down countri on our
hors it is a peril busi but less so than stai here under
the circumst if we never meet again we hope that you will forgiv

regret

and made for the littl sideentr as the main gate through which
thei had pass on their arriv wa now built up thi sideentr a
mere slit in the great wall with a precipit approach wa open for
now that their fear of the matabel had to some extent pass off the
makalanga us it to drive their sheep and goat in and out sinc it
wa so construct with sever twist and turn in the thick of the
wall that in a few minut it could be effectu block by stone
that lai at hand also the ancient architect had arrang it in such
a fashion that it wa entir command from the crest of the wall on
either side
the makalanga who had been watch their proceed curious made
no attempt to stop them although thei guess that thei might have a
littl troubl with the sentri who guard the entranc all dai and
even when it wa close at night with whom also mr clifford propos
to leav the letter when thei reach the place howev and had
dismount to lead the hors down the wind passag and the steep
ascent upon it further side it wa to find that the onli guard visibl
prove to be the old molimo himself who sat there appar half
asleep
but as thei came he show himself to be veri much awak for without
move he ask them at onc whither thei were go
to take a ride answer mr clifford the ladi my daughter is

swear to you that i dare not stai

would do well to stai and save yourselv much terror maiden have
i not said it dai and dai ago that here and here onli you must
accomplish your fate go now if you will but you shall return again
and onc more he seem to begin to doze in the sun
the two of them consult hastili togeth
it is no us turn back now said benita who wa almost weep
with doubt and vexat i will not be frighten by hi vagu talk
what can he know of the futur more than ani of the rest of us besid
all he sai is that we shall come back again and if that doe happen
at least we shall have been free for a littl while come father
as you wish answer mr clifford who seem too miser and
depress to argu onli he threw down the letter upon the molimo lap
and beg him to give it to meyer when he came to look for them
the old man took no notic no not even when benita bade him farewel
and thank him for hi kind prai that all good fortun might
attend him and hi tribe did he answer a singl word or even look
up so thei led their hors down the narrow passag where there wa
scarc room for them to pass and up the steep path beyond on
the further side of the ancient ditch thei remount them while the
makalanga watch them from the wall and canter awai along the same
road by which thei had come
now thi road or rather track ran first through the garden and then
among the countless ruin hous that in bygon ag form the great
citi whereof the mount bambats had been the citadel and sanctuari
the relic of a lost civil extend for sever mile and were
bound by a steep and narrow neck or pass in the encircl hill the
same that robert seymour and hi brother had found too difficult for
their waggon at the season in which thei visit the place some year
befor thi pass or port as it is call in south africa had been
strongli fortifi for on either side of it were the ruin of tower
moreov at it crest it wa so narrow and steepsid that a few men
post there even if thei were arm onli with bow and arrow could
hold an attack forc in check for a consider time beyond it
after the hill wa descend a bushclad plain dot with kopj and
isol granit pillar form of boulder pile on upon anoth
roll awai for mani mile
mr clifford and benita had start upon their mad journei about three
oclock in the afternoon and when the sun began to set thei found
themselv upon thi plain fifteen or sixteen mile from bambats of
which thei had long lost sight for it lai beyond the interven hill
near to them wa a kopj where thei had outspan by a spring of water
when on their recent journei and sinc thei did not dare to travel in
the dark here thei determin to offsaddl for round thi spring wa
good grass for the hors
as it chanc thei came upon some hartebeest here which were trek
down to drink but although thei would have been glad of meat thei were
afraid to shoot fear lest thei should attract attent nor for the
same reason did thei like to light a fire so have kneehalt the
hors in such fashion that thei could not wander far and turn them
loos to feed thei sat down under a tree and made some sort of a meal
off the biltong and cook corn which thei had brought with them by the
time thi wa finish dark fell for there wa littl moon so that
noth remain to do except to sleep within a circl of a few dead
thornbough which thei had drawn about their camp thi then thei
did and so weari were thei both that notwithstand all the emot
through which thei had pass and their fear lest lion should attack
themfor of these brute there were mani in thi veldrest soundli
and undisturb till within half an hour of dawn
rise somewhat chill for though the air wa warm a heavi dew had
soak their blanket onc more thei at and drank by starlight while
the hors which thei had ti up close to them dure the night
fill themselv with grass at the first break of dai thei saddl
them and befor the sun rose were on their road again at length up
it came and the sight and warmth of it put new heart into benita her
fear seem to depart with the night and she said to her father that
thi success start wa of good auguri to which he onli answer that
he hope so
all that dai thei rode forward in beauti weather not press their
hors for now thei were sure that jacob meyer who if he follow at
all must do so on foot would never be abl to overtak them at noon
thei halt and have shot a small buck benita cook some of it in
the on pot that thei had brought with them and thei at a good meal of
fresh meat
ride on again toward sundown thei came to anoth of their old
campingplac also a bushcov kopj here the spring of water
wa more than halfwai up the hill so there thei offsaddl in a green
bower of a place that becaus of it fern and moss look like a rock
garden now although thei had enough cold meat for food thei thought
themselv quit safe in light a fire inde thi it seem
necessari to do sinc thei had struck the fresh spoor of lion and
even caught sight of on gallop awai in the tall reed on the marshi
land at the foot of the hill
that even thei fare sumptuous upon venison and as on the previou
dai lai down to rest in a littl boma or fenc made of bough but
thei were not allow to sleep well thi night for scarc had thei
shut their ey when a hyena began to howl about them thei shout
and the brute went awai but an hour or two later thei heard omin
grunt sound follow present by a loud roar which wa answer
by anoth roar whereat the hors began to whinni in a frighten
fashion
lion said mr clifford jump up and throw dead wood on the
fire till it burnt to a bright blaze
after that all sleep becam imposs for although the lion did not
attack them have onc wind the hors thei would not go awai but
continu wander round the kopj grunt and growl thi went
on till abut three oclock in the morn when at last the beast took
their departur for thei heard them roar in the distanc now that
thei seem safe have first made up the fire thei tri to get some
rest
when as it appear to her benita had been asleep but a littl while
she wa awaken by a new nois it wa still dark but the starlight
show her that the hors were quit quiet inde on of them wa
ly down and the other eat some green leav from the branch
of the tree to which it wa tether therefor that nois had not come
from ani wild anim of which thei were afraid she listen intent
and present heard it again it wa a murmur like to that of peopl
talk somewher at the bottom of the hill then she woke her father
and told him but although onc or twice thei thought thei heard the
sound of footstep noth els could be distinguish still thei
rose and have saddl and bridl the hors as noiselessli as might
be wait for the dawn
at last it came up on the side of the kopj thei were in clear air
abov which shone the red light of morn but under them lai billow
of dens pearlhu mist by degre thi thin beneath the rai of
the risen sun and through it look gigant in that light benita
saw a savag wrap in a kaross who wa walk up and down and
yawn a great spear in hi hand
look she whisper look and mr clifford stare down the line of
her outstretch finger
the matabel he said my god the matabel
xv
the chase
the matabel it wa sure enough there could be no doubt of it for
soon three other men join the sentri and began to talk with him
point with their great spear at the side of the hill evid thei
were arrang a surpris when there wa suffici light to carri it
out
thei have seen our fire whisper her father to benita now if
we wish to save our live there is onli on thing to dorid for it
befor thei muster the impi will be camp upon the other side of the
hill so we must take the road we came by
that run back to bambats falter benita
bambats is better than the grave said her father prai heaven that
we mai get there
to thi argument there wa no answer so have drunk a sup of water
and swallow a few mouth of food as thei went thei crept to the
hors mount them and as silent as possibl began to ride down the
hill
the sentri wa alon again the other three men have depart he
stood with hi back toward them present when thei were quit close
on to him he heard their hors hoof upon the grass wheel round at
the sound and saw them then with a great shout he lift hi spear and
charg
mr clifford who wa lead held out hi rifl at arm lengthto
rais it to hi shoulder he had no timeand pull the trigger benita
heard the bullet clap upon the hide shield and next instant saw the
matabel warrior ly on hi back beat the air with hi hand and
feet also she saw beyond the shoulder of the kopj which thei were
round hundr of men march and behind them a herd of cattl
the dim light gleam upon the stab spear and on the horn of the
oxen she glanc to the right and there were more men the two wing
of the impi were close upon them onli a littl lane wa left in the
middl thei must get through befor it shut
come she gasp strike the hors with her heel and the butt of her
gun and jerk at it mouth
her father saw also and did likewis so that the beast broke into a
gallop now from the point of each wing sprang out thin line of men
look like great horn or nipper whose busi it wa to meet and
cut them off could thei pass between them befor thei did meet that
wa the question and upon it answer it depend whether or no thei had
anoth three minut to live to think of merci at the hand of these
bloodthirsti brute after thei had just kill on of their number
befor their ey wa absurd it wa true he had been shot in
selfdef but what count would savag take of that or of the
fact that thei were but harmless travel white peopl were not veri
popular with the matabel just then as thei knew well also their
murder in thi remot place with not anoth of their race within a
coupl of hundr mile would never even be report and much less
aveng it wa as safe as ani crime could possibl be
all thi pass through their mind as thei gallop toward those
close point oh the horror of it but two hundr yard to cover
and their fate would be decid either thei would have escap at least
for a while or time would be done with them or a third altern
thei might be taken prison in all probabl a yet more dread
doom even then benita determin that if she could help it thi should
not befal her she had the rifl and the revolv that jacob meyer had
given her sure she would be abl to find a moment to us on or the
other upon herself she clench her teeth and struck the hors again
and again so that now thei flew along the matabel soldier were
run their best to catch them and if these had been given but
five second of start caught thei must have been but that short five
second save their live
when thei rush through them the foremost men of the nipper were not
more than twenti yard apart see that thei had pass these halt
and hurl a shower of spear after them on flash by benita cheek
a line of light she felt the wind of it anoth cut her dress and
a third struck her father hors in the near hind leg just abov the
kneejoint remain fast there for a stride or two and then fall
to the ground at first the beast did not seem to be incommod by thi
wound inde it onli caus it to gallop quicker and benita rejoic
think that it wa but a scratch then she forgot about it for some
of the matabel who had gun began to shoot them and although their
marksmanship wa vile on or two of the bullet went nearer than wa
pleasant lastli a man the swiftest runner of them all shout after
them in zulu
the hors is wound we will catch you both befor the sun set
then thei pass over the crest of a rise and lost sight of them for a
while
thank god gasp benita when thei were alon again in the silent
veld but mr clifford shook hi head
do you think thei will follow us she ask
you heard what the fellow said he answer evas doubtless thei
ar on their wai to attack bambats and have been round to destroi some
other wretch tribe and steal the cattl which we saw ye i fear
that thei will follow the question is which of us can get to bambats
first
sure we ought to on the hors father
ye if noth happen to them and as he spoke the word the mare
which he wa ride drop sharpli upon her hind leg the same that had
been struck with the spear then recov herself and gallop on
did you see that he ask
she nod then said
shall we get off and look at the cut
certainli not he answer our onli chanc is to keep her move
if onc the wound stiffen there an end the sinew cannot have been
sever or it would have come befor now
so thei push on
all that morn did thei canter forward wherev the ground wa smooth
enough to allow them to do so and notwithstand the increas
lame of mr clifford mare made such good progress that by middai
thei reach the place where thei had pass the first night after
leav bambats here sheer fatigu and want of water forc them to
stop a littl while thei dismount and drank greedili from the
spring after which thei allow the hors to drink also inde it wa
imposs to keep them awai from the water then thei at a littl not
becaus thei desir food but to keep up their strength and while
thei did so examin the mare by now her hind leg wa much swollen and
blood still ran from the gash made by the assegai moreov the limb
wa drawn up so that the point of the hoof onli rest on the ground
we must get on befor it set fast said mr clifford and thei
mount again
great heaven what wa thi the mare would not stir in hi despair
mr clifford beat it cruelli whereupon the poor brute hobbl forward
a few pace on three leg and again came to a standstil either an
injur sinew had given or the inflamm wa now so intens that it
could not bend it knee understand what thi meant to them benita
nerv gave out at last and she burst into weep
dont cry love he said god will be done perhap thei have given
up the hunt by now at ani rate my leg ar left and bambats is
not more than sixteen mile awai forward now and hold to her
saddlestrap thei went up the long long slope which led to the poort in
the hill around bambats
thei would have like to shoot the mare but be afraid to fire a
rifl could not do so so thei left the unhappi beast to it fate and
with it everyth it carri except a few of the cartridg befor
thei went howev at benita prayer her father devot a few second
to unbuckl the girth and pull off the bridl so that it might
have a chanc of life for a littl wai it hobbl after them on three
leg then the saddl still upon it back stood whinni piteous
till at last to benita intens relief a turn in their path hid it
from their sight
half a mile further on she look round in the faint hope that it
might have recov itself and follow but no mare wa to be seen
someth els wa to be seen howev for there three or four mile
awai upon the plain behind them easi to be distinguish in that
dazzl air were a number of black spot that occasion seem to
sparkl
what ar thei she ask faintli as on who fear the answer
the matabel who follow us answer her father or rather a compani
of their swiftest runner it is their spear that glitter so now
my love thi is the posit he went on as thei struggl forward
those men will catch us befor ever we can get to bambats thei ar
train to run like that for fifti mile if need be but with thi
start thei cannot catch your hors you must go on and leav me to look
after myself
never never she exclaim
but you shall and you must i am your father and i order you as for
me what doe it matter i mai hide from them and escap orat least i
am old my life is done wherea your is befor you now goodby and
go on and he let go of the saddlestrap
by wai of answer benita pull up the hors
not on yard she said set her mouth
then he began to storm at her call her disobedi and unduti
and when thi mean fail to move her to implor her almost with
tear
father dear she said lean down toward him as he walk for
now thei were go on again i told you why i want to run awai from
bambats didnt ibecaus i would rather risk my life than stai
well do you think that i wish to return there and live in that place
alon with jacob meyer also i will tell you anoth thing you
rememb about mr seymour well i cant get over that i cant get
over it at all and therefor although of cours i am afraid it is all
on to me no we will escap togeth or die togeth the first if we
can
then with a groan he gave up the argument and as he found breath thei
discuss their chanc their first idea wa to hide but save for a
few tree all the countri wa open there wa no place to cover them
thei thought of the bank of the zambesi but between them and the river
rose a bare rockstrewn hill with sever mile of slope long befor
thei could reach it crest even if a hors were abl to travel there
thei must be overtaken in short there wa noth to do except to push
for the nek and if thei were fortun enough to reach it befor the
matabel to abandon the hors there and try to conceal themselv among
the ruin of the hous beyond thi perhap thei might do when onc
the sun wa down
but thei did not deceiv themselv the chanc were at least fifti to
on against them unless inde their pursuer grew weari and let them
go
at present howev thei were by no mean weari for have perceiv
them from far awai the longleg runner put on the pace and the
distanc between them and their quarri wa lessen
father said benita pleas understand on thing i do not mean to be
taken aliv by those savag
oh how can i he falter
i dont ask you she answer i will see to that myself onli if i
should make ani mistak and she look at him
the old man wa get veri tire he pant up the steep hillsid
and stumbl against the stone benita note it and slip from the
hors made him mount while she ran alongsid then when he wa a
littl rest thei chang place again and so cover sever mile
of countri subsequ when both of them were nearli exhaust thei
tri ride togethersh in front and he behind for their baggag had
long sinc been thrown awai but the weari beast could not carri thi
doubl burden and after a few hundr yard of it stumbl fell
struggl to it feet again and stop
so onc more thei were oblig to ride and walk altern
now there wa not much more than an hour of daylight left and the
narrow pass lai about three mile ahead of them that dread three
mile ever thereaft it wa benita favourit nightmar at the
begin of it the lead matabel were about two thousand yard
behind them halfwai about a thousand and at the commenc of the
last mile sai five hundr
natur is a wonder thing and great ar it resourc in extrem
as the actual crisi approach the weari of these two seem to
depart or at ani rate it wa forgotten thei no longer felt exhaust
nor had thei been fresh from their bed could thei have climb or run
better even the hors seem to find new energi and when it lag
mr clifford dug the point of hi hunt knife into it flank gasp
pant now on mount and now the other thei struggl on toward
that crest of rock while behind them came death in the shape of those
sleuthhound of matabel the sun wa go down and against it
flame ball when thei glanc back thei could see their dark form
outlin the broad spear also look red as though thei had been
dip in blood thei could even hear their taunt shout as thei
call to them to sit down and be kill and save troubl
now thei were not three hundr yard awai and the crest of the pass
wa still half a mile ahead five minut pass and here where the
track wa veri rough the hors blunder upward slowli mr clifford
wa ride at the time and benita run at hi side hold to the
stirrup leather she look behind her the savag fear that their
victim might find shelter over the hill were make a rush and
the hors could go no faster on man a great tall fellow quit
outdistanc hi companion two minut more and he wa not over a
hundr pace from them a littl nearer than thei were to the top of
the pass then the hors stop and refus to stir ani more
mr clifford jump from the saddl and benita who could not speak
point to the pursu matabel he sat down upon a rock cock hi
rifl took a deep breath and aim and fire at the soldier who wa
come on carelessli in the open mr clifford wa a good shot and
shaken though he wa at thi suprem moment hi skill did not fail
him the man wa struck somewher for he stagger about and fell
then slowli pick himself up and began to hobbl back toward hi
companion who when thei met him stop a minut to give him some
kind of assist
that halt prove their salvat for it gave them time to make on last
despair rush and gain the brow of the poort not that thi would
have save them howev sinc where thei could go the matabel could
follow and there wa still light by which the pursuer would have been
abl to see to catch them inde the savag have laid down the
wound man came on with a yell of rage fifti or more of them
over the pass father and daughter struggl benita ride after them
perhap sixti yard awai ran the matabel gather in a knot now upon
the narrow ancient road border by steep hillsid
then suddenli from all about them as it appear to benita broke
out the blaze and roar of rifl rapid and continu down went the
matabel by two and three till at last it seem as though but quit
a few of them were left upon their feet and those came on no more
thei turn and fled from the neck of the narrow pass to the open slope
beyond
benita sank to the ground and the next thing that she could rememb
wa hear the soft voic of jacob meyer who said
so you have return from your ride miss clifford and perhap it wa
as well that the thought came from you to me that you wish me to meet
you here in thi veri place
xvi
back at bambats
how thei reach bambats benita never could rememb but afterward
she wa told that both she and her father were carri upon litter made
of oxhid shield when she came to her own mind again it wa to find
herself ly in her tent outsid the mouth of the cave within the
third enclosur of the templefortress her feet were sore and her bone
ach physic discomfort that brought back to her in a flash all the
terror through which she had pass
again she saw the fierc pursu matabel again heard their cruel
shout and the answer crack of the rifl again amidst the din and
the gather dark distinguish the gentl foreign voic of meyer
speak hi word of sarcast greet next oblivion fell upon her
and after it a dim memori of be help up the hill with the sun
pour on her back and assist to climb the steep step of the wall by
mean of a rope place around her then forget again
the flap of her tent wa drawn asid and she shrank back upon her bed
shut her ey for fear lest thei should fall upon the face of jacob
meyer feel that it wa not he or learn it perhap from the
footfal she open them a littl peep at her visitor from between
her long lash he prove to benot jacob or her father but the old
molimo who stood besid her hold in hi hand a gourd fill with
goat milk then she sat up and smile at him for benita had grown
veri fond of thi ancient man who wa so unlik anyon that she had
ever met
greet ladi he said softli smile back at her with hi lip and
dreami ey for hi old face did not seem to move beneath it thousand
wrinkl i bring you milk drink it is fresh and you need food
so she took the gourd and drank to the last drop for it seem to her
that she had never tast anyth so delici
good good murmur the molimo now you will be well again
ye i shall get well she answer but oh what of my father
fear not he is still sick but he will recov also you shall see him
soon
i have drunk all the milk she broke out there is none left for
him
plenti plenti he answer wave hi thin hand there ar two cup
fullon for each we have not mani shegoat down below but the best
of their milk is save for you
tell me all that ha happen father and the old priest who like
her to call him by that name smile again with hi ey and squat
down in the corner of the tent
you went awai you rememb that you would go although i told you
that you must come back you refus my wisdom and you went and i have
learn all that befel you and how you two escap the impi well that
night after sunset when you did not return came the black oney
ye i mean meyer whom we name so becaus of hi beard and he ad
deliber hi heart he came run down the hill ask for you
and i gave him the letter
he read it and oh then he went mad he curs in hi own tongu he
threw himself about he took a rifl and wish to shoot me but i sat
silent and look at him till he grew quiet then he ask why i had
plai him thi trick but i answer that it wa no trick of mine who
had no right to keep you and your father prison against your will
and that i thought you had gone awai becaus you were afraid of him
which wa not wonder if that wa how he talk to you i told him
too i who am a doctor that unless he wa care he would go mad that
alreadi i saw mad in hi ey after which he becam quiet for my
word frighten him then he ask what could be done and i saidthat
night noth sinc you must be far awai so that it would be useless
to follow you but better to go to meet you when you came back he ask
what i meant by your come back and i answer that i meant what i
said that you would come back in great hast and perilalthough you
would not believ me when i told you sofor i had it from the munwali
whose child you ar
so i sent out my spi and that night went by and the next dai and
night went by and we sat still and did noth though the black on
wish to wander out alon after you but on the follow morn at
the dawn a messeng came in who report that it had been call to
him by hi brethren who were hidden upon hilltop and in other place
for mile and mile that the matabel impi have destroi anoth
famili of the makalanga far down the zambesi wa advanc to destroi
us also and in the afternoon came a second spy who report that you
two had been surround by the impi but had broken through them and
were ride hitherward for your live then i took fifti of the best
of our peopl and put them under the command of tama my son and sent
them to ambush the pass for against the matabel warrior on the plain
we who ar not warlik do not dare to fight
the black on went with them and when he saw how sore wa your strait
wish to run down to meet the matabel for he is a brave man but i
had said to tamasno do not try to fight them in the open for there
thei will certainli kill you moreov ladi i wa sure that you would
reach the top of the poort well you reach it though but by the
breadth of a blade of grass and my children shot with the new rifl
and the place be narrow so that thei could not miss kill mani of
those hyena of amandabel but to kill matabel is like catch flea
on a dog back there ar alwai more still it serv it turn you
and your father were brought awai safe and we lost no on
where then ar the matabel now ask benita
outsid our wall a whole regiment of them three thousand men or
more under the command of the captain maduna he of the royal blood
whose life you beg but who nevertheless hunt you like a buck
perhap he did not know who it wa suggest benita
perhap not the molimo answer rub hi chin for in such
matter even a matabel gener keep faith and you mai rememb he
promis you life for life howev thei ar here raven like lion
round the wall and that is why we carri you up to the top of the
hill that you might be safe from them
but ar you safe my father
i think so he repli with a dry littl chuckl in hi throat
whoever built thi fortress built it strong and we have block the
gate also thei caught no on outsid all ar within the wall
togeth with the sheep and goat lastli we have sent most of the
women and children across the zambesi in cano to hide in place we
know of whither the amandabel cannot follow for thei dare not swim
a river therefor for those of us that remain we have food for three
month and befor then the rain will drive the impi out
why did you not all go across the river father
for two reason ladi the first is that if we onc abandon our
stronghold which we have held from the begin lobengula would take
it and keep it so that we could never reenter into our heritag
which would be a shame to us and bring down the vengeanc of the
spirit of our ancestor upon our head the second is that as you have
return to us we stai to protect you
you ar veri good to me murmur benita
nai nai we brought you here and we do what i am told to do from
abov troubl mai still come upon you ye i think that it will come
but onc more i prai you have no fear for out of thi evil root shall
spring a flower of joi and he rose to go
stai said benita ha the chief meyer found the gold
no he ha found noth but he hunt and hunt like a hungri jackal
dig for a bone but that bone is not for him it is for you ladi
you and you onli oh i know you do not seek still you shall find
onli the next time that you want help do not run awai into the
wilder hear the word of munwali given by hi mouth the molimo of
bambats and as he spoke the old priest back himself out of the
tent stop now and again to bow to benita
a few minut later her father enter look veri weak and shaken
and support himself upon a stick happi wa the greet of these
two who with their arm about each other neck gave thank for their
escap from great peril
you see benita we cant get awai from thi place mr clifford said
present we must find that gold
bother the gold she answer with energi i hate it veri name who
can think of gold with three thousand matabel wait to kill us
somehow i dont feel afraid of them ani more said her father thei
have had their chanc and lost it and the makalanga swear that now thei
have gun to command the gate the fortress cannot be storm still i
am afraid of someon
who
jacob mayer i have seen him sever time and i think that he is
go mad
the molimo said that too but why
from the look of him he sit about mutter and glow with those
dark ey of hi and sometim groan and sometim burst into shout
of laughter that is when the fit is on him for gener he seem
right enough but get up if you think you can and you shall judg for
yourself
i dont want to said benita feebli father i am more afraid of him
now than ever oh why did you not let me stop down below among the
makalanga instead of carri me up here again where we must live
alon with that terribl jew
i wish to dear but the molimo said we should be safer abov and
order hi peopl to carri you up also jacob swore that unless you
were brought back he would kill me now you understand why i believ
that he is mad
why why gasp benita again
god know he answer with a groan but i think that he is sure that
we shall never find the gold without you sinc the molimo ha told him
that it is for you and you alon and he sai the old man ha second
sight or someth of the sort well he would have murder mei saw

despair thei were trap cut off from all help in the power of a
man who wa go mad mr clifford said noth he wa old and grow
feebl for year although he did not know it meyer had domin
him and never more so than in thi hour of stress and bewilder
moreov the man had threaten to murder him and he wa afraid not
so much for himself as for hi daughter if he were to die now what
would happen to her left alon with jacob meyer the knowledg of hi
own folli understood too late fill him with shame how could he have
been so wick as to bring a girl upon such a quest in the compani of an
unprincipl jew of whose past he knew noth except that it wa murki
and dubiou he had commit a great crime led on by a love of lucr
and the weight of it press upon hi tongu and close hi lip he
knew not what to sai
for a littl while benita wa silent also hope di within her but
she wa a boldspirit woman and by degre her courag reassert
itself indign fill her breast and shone through her dark ey
suddenli she turn upon jacob who sat befor them smoke hi pipe and
enjoi their discomfitur
how dare you she ask in a low concentr voic how dare you
you coward
he shrank a littl beneath her scorn and anger then seem to recov
and brace himself as on doe who feel that a great struggl is at

you dont know how it hurt well i will tell you and befor your
father for that is more honour i darefor your sake
for my sake how can it benefit me to be coop up in thi horribl
place with you i would rather trust myself with the makalanga or
even she ad with bitter scorn even with those bloodymind
matabel
you ran awai from them veri fast a littl while ago miss clifford but
you do not understand me when i said for your sake i meant for my
own see now you tri to leav me the other dai and did not succe
anoth time you might succe and thenwhat would happen to me

which you dream dai and night mr meyer
ye he interrupt quickli becaus i believ that in you i shall
find the treasur of which i dream dai and night and becaus that
treasur ha becom necessari to my life
benita turn quickli toward her father who wa puzzl over the
word but befor either of them could speak jacob pass hi hand
across hi brow in a bewild wai and said
what wa i talk of the treasur ye the uncount treasur of
pure gold that li hid so deep that is so hard to discov and to
possess the useless buri treasur that would bring such joi and
glori to us both if onli it could be come at and reckon out piec by
piec coin by coin through the long long year of life
again he paus then went on
well miss clifford you ar quit right that is why i have dare to
make you a prison becaus as the old molimo said the treasur is
your and i wish to share it now about thi treasur it seem that it
cant be found can it although i have work so hard and he look
at hi delic scar hand

down to the makalanga
but there is a wai miss clifford there is a wai you know where it
li and you can show me
if i knew i would show you soon enough mr meyer for then you could
take the stuff and our partnership would be at an end
not until it is divid ounc by ounc and coin by coin but
firstfirst you must show me as you sai you will and as you can
how mr meyer i am not a magician
ah but you ar i will tell you how have your promis listen now

while miss clifford and you will go to sleep quit gentli and then
in your sleep which shall not harm you at all you will see where that
gold li hidden and you will tell us
what do you mean ask benita bewild

to mesmer her as you did the zulu chief
benita open her lip to speak but meyer said quickli
no no hear me first befor you refus you have the gift the
preciou gift of clairvoy that is so rare
how do you know that mr meyer i have never been mesmer in my
life
it doe not matter how i do know it i have been sure of it from the
moment when first we met that night by the kloof although perhap
you felt noth then it wa that gift of your work upon a mind in
tune my mind which led me there in time to save you as it wa that
gift of your which warn you of the disast about to happen to the
shipoh i have heard the stori from your own lip your spirit can
loos itself from the bodi it can see the past and the futur it can
discov the hidden thing
i do not believ it answer benita but at least it shall not be
loos by you
it shall it shall he cri with passion hi ey blaze on her as
he spoke oh i foresaw all thi and that is why i wa determin you
should come with us so that should other mean fail we might have
your power to fall back upon well thei have fail i have been
patient i have said noth but now there is no other wai will you be
so selfish so cruel as to deni me you who can make us all rich in an
hour and take no hurt at all no more than if you had slept awhil
ye answer benita i refus to deliv my will into the keep of
ani live man and least of all into your mr meyer
he turn to her father with a gestur of despair
cannot you persuad her clifford she is your daughter she will obei
you
not in that said benita
no answer mr clifford i cannot and i wouldnt if i could my
daughter is quit right moreov i hate thi supernatur kind of
thing if we cant find thi gold without it then we must let it alon
that is all
meyer turn asid to hide hi face and present look up again and
spoke quit softli
i suppos that i must accept my answer but when you talk of ani
live man just now miss clifford did you includ your father
she shook her head
then will you allow him to try to mesmer you
benita laugh
oh ye if he like she said but i do not think that the oper
will be veri success
good we will see tomorrow now like you i am tire i am go to
bed in my new camp by the wall he ad significantli
why ar you so dead set against thi busi ask her father when
he had gone
oh father she answer cant you see dont you understand then
it is hard to have to tell you but i must in the begin mr meyer
onli want the gold now he want more me as well as the gold i hate
him you know that is why i ran awai but i have read a good deal about
thi mesmer and seen it onc or twice and who know if onc i
allow hi mind to master my mind although i hate him so much i might
becom hi slave
i understand now said mr clifford oh why did i ever bring you
here it would have been better if i had never seen your face again
on the morrow the experi wa made mr clifford attempt to
mesmer hi daughter all the morn jacob who it now appear had
practic knowledg of thi doubt art tri to instruct him therein
in the cours of the lesson he inform him that for a short period in
the past have great natur power in that direct he had made us
of them profession onli give up the busi becaus he found
it wreck hi health mr clifford remark that he had never told him
that befor
there ar lot of thing in my life that i have never told you
repli jacob with a littl secret smile for instanc onc i
mesmer you although you did not know it and that is why you alwai
have to do what i want you to except when your daughter is near you
for her influenc is stronger than mine
mr clifford stare at him
no wonder benita wont let you mesmer her he said shortli
then jacob saw hi mistak
you ar more foolish than i thought he said how could i mesmer
you without your know it i wa onli laugh at you
i didnt see the laugh repli mr clifford uneasili and thei went
on with the lesson
that afternoon it wa put to proofin the cave itself where meyer
seem to think that the influenc would be propiti benita who
found some amus in the perform wa seat upon the stone step
underneath the crucifix on lamp on the altar and other on each side
of her
in front stood her father stare at her and wave hi hand
mysteri in obedi to jacob direct so ridicul did he
look inde while thu engag that benita had the greatest difficulti
in prevent herself from burst into laughter thi wa the onli
effect which hi grimac and gesticul produc upon her although
outwardli she kept a solemn appear and even from time to time shut
her ey to encourag him onc when she open them again it wa to
perceiv that he wa becom veri hot and exhaust and that jacob wa
watch him with such an unpleas intent that she reclos her
ey that she might not see hi face
it wa shortli after thi that of a sudden benita did feel someth
a kind of penetr power flow upon her someth soft and subtl
that seem to creep into her brain like the sound of her mother
lullabi in the dim year ago she began to think that she wa a lost
travel among alpin snow wrap round by snow fall fall in
ten myriad flake everi on of them with a littl heart of fire then
it came to her that she had heard thi snowsleep wa danger the
last of all sleep and that it victim must rous themselv or die
benita rous herself just in timeonli just for now she wa be
born over the edg of a precipic upon the wing of swan and beneath
her wa dark wherein dim figur walk with lamp where their
heart should be oh how heavi were her eyelid sure a weight hung
to each of them a golden weight there there thei were open and she
saw her father had ceas hi effort he wa rub hi brow with a
red pockethandkerchief but behind him with rigid arm outstretch
hi glow ey fasten on her face stood jacob meyer by an effort
she sprang to her feet shake her head as a dog doe
have done with thi nonsens she said it tire me and snatch
on of the lamp she ran swiftli down the place
benita expect that jacob meyer would be veri angri with her and
brace herself for a scene but noth of the sort happen a while
afterward she saw the two of them approach engag appar in
amic talk
mr meyer sai that i am no mesmerist love said her father and i
can quit believ him but for all that it is a weari job i am as tire
as i wa after our escap from the matabel
she laugh and answer
to judg by result i agre with you the occult is not in your line
father you had better give it up
did you then feel noth ask meyer
noth at all she answer look him in the ey no that
wrong i felt extrem bore and sorri to see my father make
himself ridicul grei hair and nonsens of that sort dont go well
togeth
no he answer i agre with younot of that sort and the subject
drop
for the next few dai to her intens relief benita heard no more
of mesmer to begin with there wa someth els to occupi their
mind the matabel tire of march round the fortress and sing
endless warsong had determin upon an assault from their point of
vantag on the topmost wall the three could watch the prepar which
thei made tree were cut down and brought in from a great distanc that
rude ladder might be fashion out of them also spi wander round
reconnoitr for a weak place in the defenc when thei came too near
the makalanga fire on them kill some so that thei retreat to
the camp which thei had made in a fold of ground at a littl distanc
suddenli it occur to meyer that although here the matabel were safe
from the makalanga bullet it wa command from the greater emin
and by wai of recreat he set himself to harass them hi rifl wa a
sport martini and he had an ampl suppli of ammunit moreov he
wa a beauti marksman with sight like that of a hawk
a few trial shot gave him the rang it wa a shade under seven hundr
yard and then he began oper ly on the top of the wall
and rest hi rifl upon a stone he wait until the man who wa
superintend the manufactur of the ladder came out into the open
when aim carefulli he fire the soldier a whitebeard savag
sprang into the air and fell backward while hi companion stare
upward wonder whenc the bullet had come
pretti wasnt it said meyer to benita who wa watch through a
pair of fieldglass
i dare sai she answer but i dont want to see ani more and
give the glass to her father she climb down the wall
but meyer stai there and from time to time she heard the report of
hi rifl in the even he told her that he had kill six men and
wound ten more ad that it wa the best dai shoot which he
could rememb
what is the us when there ar so mani she ask
not much he answer but it annoi them and amus me also it
wa part of our bargain that we should help the makalanga if thei were
attack
i believ that you like kill peopl she said
i dont mind it miss clifford especi as thei tri to kill you
xviii
the other benita
at irregular time when he had noth els to do jacob went on with
hi manshoot in which mr clifford join him though with less
effect soon it becam evid that the matabel were veri much annoi
by the fatal accuraci of thi fire loss of life thei did not mind in
the abstract but when none of them knew but that their own turn might
come next to perish beneath these downward plung bullet the matter
wore a differ face to them to leav their camp wa not easi sinc
thei had made a thorn boma round it to protect them in case the
makalanga should make a night salli also thei could find no other
conveni spot the upshot of it all wa to hurri their assault which
thei deliv befor thei had prepar suffici ladder to make it
effect
at the first break of dawn on the third dai after mr clifford attempt
at mesmer benita wa awaken by the sound of shout and fire
have dress herself hastili she hurri in the grow light toward
that part of the wall from below which the nois seem to come and
climb it found her father and jacob alreadi seat there their
rifl in hand
the fool ar attack the small gate through which you went out
ride miss clifford the veri worst place that thei could have chosen
although the wall look veri weak there said the latter if those
makalanga have ani pluck thei ought to teach them a lesson
then the sun rose and thei saw compani of matabel who carri
ladder in their hand rush onward through the morn mist till
their sight of them wa obstruct by the swell of the hill on these
compani the two white men open fire with what result thei could not
see in that light present a great shout announc that the enemi had
gain the foss and were set up the ladder up to thi time the
makalanga appear to have done noth but now thei began to fire
rapidli from the ancient bastion which command the entranc the impi
wa strive to storm and soon through the thin fog thei perceiv
wound matabel stagger and crawl back toward their camp of
these the light now better jacob did not neglect to take hi toll
meanwhil the ancient fortress rang with the hideou tumult of the
attack it wa evid that again and again as their fierc warshout
proclaim the matabel were strive to scale the wall and again and
again were beaten back by the rake rifl fire onc a triumphant yell
seem to announc their success the fire slacken and benita grew
pale with fear
the makalanga coward ar bolt mutter mr clifford listen
with terribl anxieti
but if so their courag came back to them for present the gun
crack louder and more incess than befor and the savag cri of
kill kill kill dwindl and di awai anoth five minut and the
matabel were in full retreat bear with them mani dead and wound
men upon their back or stretch out on the ladder
our makalanga friend should be grate to us for those hundr
rifl said jacob as he load and fire rapidli send hi bullet
wherev the cluster were thickest had it not been for them their
throat would have been cut by now he ad for thei could never
have stop those savag with the spear
ye and our too befor nightfal said benita with a shudder
for the sight of thi desper frai and fear of how it might end had
sicken her thank heaven it is over perhap thei will give up the
sieg and go awai
but notwithstand their costli defeat for thei had lost over a
hundr men the matabel who were afraid to return to buluwayo except
as victor did noth of the sort thei onli cut down a quantiti of
reed and scrub and move their camp nearli to the bank of the river
place it in such a posit that it could no longer be search by
the fire of the two white men here thei sat themselv down sullenli
hope to starv out the garrison or to find some other wai of enter
the fortress
now meyer shoot have come to an end for lack of men to shoot at
sinc the enemi expos themselv no more he wa again abl to give
hi full attent to the matter of the treasur hunt
as noth could be found in the cave he devot himself to the outsid
enclosur which it mai be rememb wa grown over with grass and
tree and crowd with ruin in the most import of these ruin thei
began to dig somewhat aimlessli and were reward by find a certain
amount of gold in the shape of bead and ornament and a few more
skeleton of ancient but of the portugues hoard there wa no sign
thu it came about that thei grew gloomier dai by dai till at last thei
scarc spoke to each other jacob angri disappoint wa written
on hi face and benita wa fill with despair sinc to escap from
their gaoler abov and the matabel below seem imposs moreov
she had anoth caus for anxieti
the illhealth which had been threaten her father for a long while
now fell upon him in earnest so that of a sudden he becam a veri old
man hi strength and energi left him and hi mind wa so fill with
remors for what he held to be hi crime in bring hi daughter to
thi aw place and with terror for the fate that threaten her that
he could think of noth els in vain did she try to comfort him he
would onli wring hi hand and groan prai that god and she would
forgiv him now too meyer masteri over him becam continu more
evid mr clifford implor the man almost with tear to unblock
the wall and allow them to go down to the makalanga he even tri to
bribe him with the offer of all hi share of the treasur if it were
found and when that fail of hi properti in the transvaal
but jacob onli told him roughli not to be a fool as thei had to see the
thing through togeth then he would go again and brood by himself
and benita notic that he alwai took hi rifl or a pistol with him
evid he fear lest her father should catch him unprepar and
take the law into hi own hand by mean of a sudden bullet
on comfort she had howev although he watch her close the
jew never tri to molest her in ani wai not even with more of hi
enigmat and amor speech by degre inde she came to believ
that all thi wa gone from hi mind or that he had abandon hi
advanc as hopeless
a week pass sinc the matabel attack and noth had happen the
makalanga took no notic of them and so far as she wa awar the
old molimo never attempt to climb the block wall or otherwis to
commun with them a thing so strang that know hi affect
for her benita came to the conclus that he must be dead kill
perhap in the attack even jacob meyer had abandon hi dig and
sat about all dai do noth but think
their meal that night wa a miser affair sinc in the first place
provis were run short and there wa littl to eat and in the
second no on spoke a word benita could swallow no food she wa weari
of that sundri trekox for sinc meyer had block the wall thei had
littl els but by good fortun there remain plenti of coffe and
of thi she drank two cup which jacob prepar and hand to her
with much polit it tast veri bitter to her but thi benita
reflect wa becaus thei lack milk and sugar supper end meyer
rose and bow to her mutter that he wa go to bed and a few
minut later mr clifford follow hi exampl she went with her
father to the hut beneath the tree and have help him to remov hi
coat which now he seem to find difficulti in do for himself bade
him goodnight and return to the fire
it wa veri lone there in the silenc for no sound came from either
the matabel or the makalanga camp and the bright moonlight seem to
peopl the place with fantast shadow that look aliv benita cri
a littl now that her father could not see her and then also sought
refug in bed evid the end whatev it might be wa near and of
it she could not bear to think moreov her ey were strang heavi
so much so that befor she had finish sai her prayer sleep fell
upon her and she knew no more
had she remain as wake as it wa often her fate to be dure those
fear dai toward midnight she might have heard some lightfoot
creatur creep to her tent and seen that the moonrai which flow
through the gape and illclos flap were cut off by the figur of a
man with glow ey whose project arm wave over her mysteri
but benita neither heard nor saw in her drug rest she did not know
that her sleep turn gradual to a magic swoon she had no knowledg
of her rise or of how she threw her thick cloak about her lit her
lamp and in obedi to that beckon finger glide from the tent
she never heard her father stumbl from hi hut disturb by the sound
of footstep or the word that pass between him and jacob meyer
while lamp in hand she stood near them like a strengthless ghost
if you dare to wake her hiss jacob i tell you that she will die
and afterward you shall die and he finger the pistol at hi belt
no harm shall come to heri swear it follow and see man man be
silent our fortun hang on it
then overcom also by the strang fierc of that voic and gaze he
follow
on thei go to the wind neck of the cavern first jacob walk
backward like the herald of majesti then majesti itself in the shape
of thi longhair deathlik woman cloak and bear in her hand
the light and last behind the old whitebeard man like time
follow beauti to the grave now thei were in the great cavern and
now avoid the open tomb the well mouth and the altar thei stood
beneath the crucifix

upon the step at the foot of the cross place the lamp on the rock
pavement befor her and bow her head till her hair fell upon her
nake feet and hid them he held hi hand abov her for a while then

woman went with her as it seem the name ha gone he ad
have done said mr clifford the thing is unholi wake her up or i
will
and bring about her death touch or disturb her and i tell you she
will die and he point to benita who crouch befor them so white
and motionless that inde it seem as though alreadi she were dead
be quiet he went on i swear to you that no hurt shall come to her
also that i will translat everyth to you promis or i will tell
you noth and her blood be on your head
then mr clifford groan and said
i promis
tell me your stori benita da ferreira how came you and your peopl
here
the tribe of monomotapa rose against our rule thei kill mani of
us in the lower land ye thei kill my brother and him to whom i wa
affianc the rest of us fled north to thi ancient fortress hope
thenc to escap by the river the zambesi the mambo our vassal gave
us shelter here but the tribe besieg the wall in thousand and
burnt all the boat so that we could not fly by the water mani time we
beat them back from the wall the ditch wa full of their dead and at
last thei dare to attack no more
then we began to starv and thei won the first wall we went on
starv and thei won the second wall but the third wall thei could not
climb so we di on by on we laid ourselv down in thi cave and
di till i alon wa left for while our peopl had food thei gave it
to me who wa the daughter of their captain ye alon i knelt at the
foot of thi crucifix by the bodi of my father prai to the bless
son of mari for the death that would not come and kneel there i
swoon when i awok again the mambo and hi men stood about me for
now know us to be dead the tribe had gone and those who were in
hide across the river had return and knew how to climb the wall
thei bore me from among the dead thei gave me food so that my strength
came back but in the night i who in my wicked would not live
escap from them and climb the pillar of black rock so that when
the sun rose thei saw me stand there thei beg of me to come down
promis to protect me but i said no who in the evil of my heart
onli desir to die that i might join my father and my brother and on
who wa dearer to me than all thei ask of me where the great treasur
wa hidden
at these word jacob gasp then rapidli translat them while the
figur befor them becam silent as though it felt that for the moment
the power of hi will wa withdrawn
speak on i bid you he said and she continu the rich slow voic
drop word after word from the lip of benita in the alien speech
that thi benita never knew
i answer that it wa where it wa and that if thei gave it up to
ani save the on appoint then that fate which had befallen my peopl
would befal their also ye i gave it into their keep until i came
again sinc with hi dy breath my father had command me to reveal
it to none and i believ that i who wa about to die should never come
again
then i made my last prayer i kiss the golden crucifix that now hang
upon thi breast wherein i dwell and the hand of the live benita wa
lift and move like the hand of a dead thing slowli drew out the
symbol from beneath the cloak held it for a moment in the lamplight
and let it fall to it place again i put my hand befor my ey that
i might not see and i hurl myself from the pinnacl
now the voic ceas but from the lip came a dread sound such as
might be utter by on whose bone ar shatter upon rock follow
by other sound like those of on who choke in water thei were so
horribl to hear that mr clifford nearli faint and even jacob meyer
stagger and turn white as the white face of benita
wake her for god sake wake her said her father she is dy as
that woman di hundr of year ago
not till she ha told us where the gold is be quiet you fool she
doe not feel or suffer it is the spirit within her that live through
the past again

oh would that i were dead as my bodi is dead wail the lip of
benita ala i cannot die who suffer thi purgatori and must dwell on

to be the guardian of that accurs gold which wa wrung from the earth
by cruelti and paid for with the live of men

jacob forget had address her in portugues

but no word came though he question her mani time no word came
till at last her head sank forward upon her knee and in a faint voic
she murmur
loos me or i die
xix

still jacob meyer hesit the great secret wa unlearn and if
thi occas pass might never be learn but if he hesit mr
clifford did not the knowledg of hi child danger the sens that
her life wa mysteri slip awai from her under pressur of the
ghastli spell in which she lai enthral stir him to mad hi
strength and manhood came back to him he sprang straight at meyer
throat grip it with on hand and with the other drew the knife he
wore
you devil he gasp wake her or you shall go with her and he
lift the knife
then jacob gave in shake off hi assail he step to benita and
while her father stood behind him with the lift blade began to make
strang upward pass over her and to mutter word of command for a
long while thei took no effect inde both of them were almost sure
that she wa gone despair grip her father and meyer work at hi
black art so furious that the sweat burst out upon hi forehead and
fell in great drop to the floor
oh at last at last she stir her head lift itself a littl her
breast heav
lord in heaven i have save her mutter jacob in german and work
on
now the ey of benita open and now she stood up and sigh but she
said noth onli like a person walk in her sleep she began to move
toward the entranc of the cave her father go befor her with the
lamp on she went and out of it straight to her tent where instantli
she cast herself upon her bed and sank into deep slumber it wa as
though the power of the druginduc oblivion which for a while
wa overmast by that other stronger power invok by jacob had
reassert itself
meyer watch her for awhil then said to mr clifford
dont be afraid and dont attempt to disturb her she will wake
natur in the morn
i hope so for both our sake he answer glare at him for if
not you or i or the two of us will never see anoth
meyer took no notic of hi threat inde the man seem so exhaust
that he could scarc stand
i am done he said now as she is safe i dont care what happen to
me i must rest and he stagger from the tent like a drunken man
outsid at the place where thei at mr clifford heard him gulp
down raw gin from the bottl then he heard no more
all the rest of the night and for some hour of the earli morn did
her father watch by the bed of benita although lightli clad as he wa
the cold of dawn struck to hi bone at length when the sun wa well
up she rose in her bed and her ey open

from there and it will be a comfort to be sure that there ar other
human be left in the world besid ourselv and jacob meyer
so present thei went and from the spot whenc meyer us to shoot at
the matabel camp look down upon the makalanga move about the first
enclosur far below by the aid of the glass benita even thought that
she recognis tama although of thi it wa difficult to be sure for
thei were all veri much alik still the discoveri quit excit her
i am sure it is tama she said and oh how i wish that we were down
there with him although it is true that then we should be nearer to the
matabel but thei ar better than mr meyer much better
now for a while thei were silent till at length she said suddenli
father you ar keep someth back from me and thing begin to
come back tell me did i go anywher last night with mr meyery and
he and i togeth
he hesit and look guilti mr clifford wa not a good actor
i see that we did i am sure that we did father tell me i must know
i will know
then he gave wai
i didnt want to speak dear but perhap it is best it is a veri
strang stori will you promis not to be upset
i will promis not to be more upset than i am at present she
answer with a sad littl laugh go on
you rememb that jacob meyer want to mesmer you
i am not like to forget it she answer
well last night he did mesmer you
what she said what oh how dread now i understand it all
but when
when you were sound asleep i suppos at least the first i knew of
it wa that some nois woke me and i came out of the hut to see you
follow him like a dead woman with a lamp in your hand
then he told her all the stori while she listen aghast
how dare he she gasp when her father had finish the long tale
i hate him i almost wish that you had kill him and she clench
her littl hand and shook them in the air
that is not veri christian of you miss clifford said a voic behind
her but it is past on oclock and as i am still aliv i have come to
tell you that it is time for luncheon
benita wheel round upon the stone on which she sat and there
stand amidst the bush a littl wai from the foot of the wall wa
jacob meyer their ey met her were full of defianc and hi of
consciou power
i do not want ani luncheon mr meyer she said
but i am sure that you do pleas come down and have some pleas come
down
the word were spoken humbl almost pleadingli yet to benita thei
seem as a command at ani rate with slow reluct she climb down
the shatter wall follow by her father and without speak thei
went back to their camp place all three of them jacob lead the
wai
when thei had eaten or made pretenc to eat he spoke
i see that your father ha told you everyth miss clifford and of
that i am glad as for me it would have been awkward who must ask your
forgiv for so much but what could i do i knew as i have alwai
known that it wa onli possibl to find thi treasur by your help
so i gave you someth to make you sleep and then in your sleep i
hypnot you andyou know the rest i have great experi in thi
art but i have never seen or heard of anyth like what happen and
i hope i never shall again
hitherto benita had sat silent but now her burn indign and
curios overcam her shame and hatr
mr meyer she said you have done a shame and a wick thing and
i tell you at onc that i can never forgiv you
dont sai that pleas dont sai that he interrupt in tone of real
grief make allow for me i had to learn and there wa no other
wai you ar a born clairvoyant on among ten thousand my art told me
so and you know all that is at stake
by which you mean so mani ounc of gold mr meyer
by which i mean the great that gold can give miss clifford
such great mr meyer as a week of fever or a matabel spear or
god will can rob you of but the thing is done and soon or late the
sin must be paid for now i want to ask you a question you believ in
noth you have told me so sever time you sai that there is no
such thing as a spirit that when we die we die and there an end do
you not
ye i do
then tell me what wa it that spoke out of my lip last night and how
came it that i who know no portugues talk to you in that tongu
he shrug hi shoulder
you have put a difficult question but on i think that can be
answer there is no such thing as a spirit an ident that surviv
death but there is such a thing as the subconsci self which is part
of the anim principl of the univers and if onli it knowledg
can be unseal know all that ha pass and all that is pass in
that univers on dai perhap you will read the work of my compatriot
hegel and there you will find it spoken of
you explain noth
i am about to explain miss clifford last night i gave to your
subconsci selfthat which know allth strength of liberti so
that it saw the past as it happen in thi place alreadi you knew
the stori of the dead girl benita da ferreira and that stori you
reenact talk the tongu she us as you would have talk greek
or ani other tongu had it been her it wa not her spirit that
anim you although at the time i call it so for short but
your own buri knowledg trick out and furnish by the effort of
your human imagin that her name benita should have been your
also is no doubt a strang coincid but no more also we have no
proof that it wa so onli what you said in your tranc
perhap said benita who wa in no mood for philosoph argument
perhap also on dai you will see a spirit mr meyer and think
otherwis
when i see a spirit and know that it is a spirit then doubtless
i shall believ in spirit but what is the good of talk of such
thing i do not seek spirit i seek portugues gold now i am sure
you can tell where that gold li you would have told us last night
had not your nervou strength fail you who ar unaccustom to the
state of tranc speak as benita da ferreira you said that you saw
it and describ it condit then you could or would sai no more
and it becam necessari to waken you miss clifford you must let me
mesmer you onc again for a few minut onli for then we will wast
no time on past histori and we shall find the gold unless inde
he ad by an afterthought and look at her sharpli you know
alreadi where it is in which case i need not troubl you
i do not know mr meyer i rememb noth about the gold
which prove my theori what purport to be the spirit of benita
da ferreira said that it had pass the secret on to you but in your
wake state you do not know that secret in fact she did not pass it
on becaus she had no exist but in your subconsci state you
will know therefor i must mesmer you again not at onc but in
a few dai time when you have quit recov let us sai next
wednesdai three dai henc
you shall never mesmer me again mr meyer
no not while i live broke in her father who had been listen to
thi discuss in silenc
jacob bow hi head meekli
you think so now but i think otherwis what i did last night i did
against your will and that i can do again onli much more easili but i
had rather do it with your will who work not for my own sake onli but
for the sake of all of us and now let us talk no more of the matter
lest we should grow angri then he rose and went awai
the next three dai were pass by benita in a state of constant dread
she knew in herself that jacob meyer had acquir a certain command over
her that an invinc intimaci had sprung up between them she wa
acquaint with hi thought thu befor he ask for it she
would find herself pass him some articl at tabl or elsewher or
answer a question that he wa onli about to ask moreov he could
bring her to him from a littl distanc thu on two or three occas
when she wa wander about their prison enclosur as she wa wont to
do for the sake of exercis she found her feet draw to some spotnow
on place and now anotherand when she reach it there befor her wa
jacob meyer
forgiv me for bring you here he would sai smile after hi
crook fashion and lift hi hat polit but i wish to ask you if
you have not chang your mind as to be mesmer
then for a while he would hold her with hi ey so that her feet
seem root to the ground till at length it wa as though he cut a
rope by some action of hi will and set her free and choke with wrath
and blind with tear benita would turn and run from him as from a wild
beast
but if her dai were evil oh what were her night she live in
constant terror lest he should again drug her food or drink and while
she slept throw hi magic spell upon her to protect herself from the
first danger she would swallow noth that had been near him now also
she slept in the hut with her father who lai near it door a load
rifl at hi side for he had told jacob outright that if he caught him
at hi practic he would shoot him a threat at which the younger man
laugh aloud for he had no fear of mr clifford
throughout the long hour of dark thei kept watch altern on
of them ly down to rest while the other peer and listen nor
did benita alwai listen in vain for twice at least she heard stealthi
footstep creep about the hut and felt that soft and dread
influenc flow in upon her then she would wake her father
whisper he is there i can feel that he is there but by the time
that the old man had painfulli drag himself to hi feetfor now he
wa becom veri feebl and acut rheumat or some such ill had
got hold of himand crept from the hut there wa no on to be seen
onli through the dark he would hear the sound of a retreat step
and of low mock laughter
thu those miser dai went by and the third morn came that
dread wednesdai befor it wa dawn benita and her father neither of
whom had close their ey that night talk over their strait long and
earnestli and thei knew that it crisi wa approach
i think that i had better try to kill him benita he said i am
grow dreadfulli weak and if i put it off i mai find no strength
and you will be at hi merci i can easili shoot him when hi back is
turn and though i hate the thought of such a deed sure i shall be
forgiven or if not i cannot help it i must think of my duti to you
not of myself
no no she answer i will not have it it would be murder
although he ha threaten you after all father i believ that the
man is half mad and not respons we must take our chanc and trust
to god to save us if he doe not she ad at the worst i can
alwai save myself and she touch the pistol which now she wore dai
and night
so be it said mr clifford with a groan let us prai for
deliver from thi hell and keep our hand clean of blood
xx
jacob meyer see a spirit
for a while thei were silent then benita said
father is it not possibl that we might escap after all perhap
that stair on the rampart is not so complet block that we could not
climb over it
mr clifford think of hi stiff limb and ach back shook hi
head and answer
i dont know meyer ha never let me near enough to see
well why do you not go to look you know he sleep till late now
becaus he is up all night take the glass and examin the top of the
wall from insid that old hous near by he will not see or hear you
but if i came near he would know and wake up
if you like love i can try but what ar you go to do while i am
awai
i shall climb the pillar
you dont mean and he stop
no no noth of that sort i shall not follow the exampl of benita
da ferreira unless i am driven to it i want to look that is all on
can see far from that place if there is anyth to see perhap the
matabel ar gone now we have heard noth of them late
so thei dress themselv and as soon as the light wa suffici
strong came out of the hut and part mr clifford rifl in hand
limp off toward the wall and benita go toward the great
cone she climb it easili enough and stood in the littl cuplik
depress on it dizzi peak wait for the sun to rise and dispers
the mist which hung over the river and it bank
now whatev mai have been the exact ceremoni us to which the
ancient put thi pinnacl without doubt it had someth to do with
sunworship thi inde wa prove by the fact that at ani rate at
thi season of the year the first rai of the risen orb struck full
upon it point thu it came about that as she stood there wait
benita of a sudden found herself suffus in light so vivid and intens
that cloth as she wa in a dress which had onc been white it must
have caus her to shine like a silver imag for sever minut
inde thi golden spear of fire blind her so that she could see
noth but stood quit still afraid to move and wait until
as the sun grew higher it level rai pass over her thi thei did
present and plung into the vallei began to drive awai the fog
now she look down along the line of the river
the matabel camp wa invis for it lai in a hollow almost at the
foot of the fortress beyond it howev wa a rise swell of ground
it mai have been half a mile from where she stood and on the crest
of it she perceiv what look like a waggon tent with figur move
round it thei were shout also for through the silenc of the
african morn the sound of their voic float up to her
as the mist clear off benita saw that without doubt it wa a waggon
for there stood the long row of oxen also it had just been captur
by the matabel for these were about it in number at the moment
howev thei appear to be otherwis occupi for thei were point
with their spear to the pillar on bambats
then it occur to benita that place as she wa in that fierc light
with onli the sky for background she must be perfectli visibl from
the plain below and that it might be her figur perch like an eagl
between heaven and earth which excit their interest ye and not
their onli for now a white man appear who lift what might have
been a gun or a telescop toward her she wa sure from the red
flannel shirt and the broad hat which he wore that he must be a white
man and oh how her heart yearn toward him whoever he might be the
sight of an angel from heaven could scarc have been more welcom to
benita in her wretched
yet sure she must be dream what should a white man and a waggon
be do in that place and why had not the matabel kill him at onc
she could not tell yet thei appear to have no murder intent
sinc thei continu to gesticul and talk whilst he stare upward
with the telescop if it were a telescop so thing went on for a
long time for meanwhil the oxen were outspan until inde more
matabel arriv who led off the white man appar against hi
will toward their camp where he disappear then there wa noth
more to be seen benita descend the column
at it foot she met her father who had come to seek her
what is the matter he ask note her excit face
oh she said or rather sob there is a waggon with a white man
below i saw the matabel captur him
then i am sorri for the poor devil answer the father for he
is dead by now but what could a white man have been do here some
hunter i suppos who ha walk into a trap
the face of benita fell
i hope she said that he might help us
as well might he hope that we could help him he is gone and there is
an end well peac to hi soul and we have our own troubl to think
of i have been to look at that wall and it is useless to think of
climb it if he had been a profession mason meyer could not have
built it up better no wonder that we have seen noth more of the
molimo for onli a bird could reach us
where wa mr meyer ask benita
asleep in a blanket under a littl shelter of bough by the stair at
least i thought so though it wa rather difficult to make him out in
the shadow at ani rate i saw hi rifl set against a tree come let
us go to breakfast no doubt he will turn up soon enough
so thei went and for the first time sinc the sundai benita at a
hearti meal of biscuit soak in coffe although her father wa so
sure that by now he must have perish on the matabel spear the sight
of the white man and hi waggon had put new life into her bring her
into touch with the world again after all might it not chanc that he
had escap
all thi while there had been no sign of jacob meyer thi howev did
not surpris them for now he at hi meal alon take hi food from
a littl gener store and cook it over hi own fire when thei had
finish their breakfast mr clifford remark that thei had no more
drink water left and benita said that she would go to fetch a
pail from the well in the cave her father suggest that he should
accompani her but she answer that it wa not necessari as she wa
quit abl to wind the chain by herself so she went carri the
bucket in on hand and a lamp in the other
as she walk down the last of the zigzag lead to the cave benita
stop a moment think that she saw a light and then went on
sinc on turn the corner there wa noth but dark befor her
evid she had been mistaken she reach the well and hung the pail
on to the great copper hook wonder as she did so how mani folk had
done likewis in the far far past for the massiv metal of that hook
wa worn quit thin with us then she let the roller run and the sound
of the travel chain clank dismal in that vault empti place
at length the pail struck the water and she began to wind up again
paus at time to rest for the distanc wa long and the chain heavi
the bucket appear benita drew it to the side of the well and lift
it from the hook then took up her lamp to be gone
feel or see someth which she wa not sure she held the lamp
abov her head and by it light perceiv a figur stand between her
and the entranc to the cave
who ar you she ask whereon a soft voic answer out of the
dark the voic of jacob meyer

benita lift her hand to find the pistol at her waist it fell back
again she had no strength it wa as though she were paralys as a
bird is paralys by a snake so that it cannot open it wing and fly
awai but sit there await death she wa given over into the
hand of thi man whom she hate could heaven allow such a thing she
wonder dimli and all the while hi lip drew nearer to her face
thei touch her own and then why or wherefor benita never
understood the spell broke all hi power wa gone she wa as she had
been a free woman mistress of herself contemptu she thrust the
man asid and not even troubl to run lift her pail of water and
walk awai
soon she saw the light again and joyfulli extinguish her lamp
inde the breast of benita which should have been so troubl after
the scene through which she had pass strang enough wa fill with
happi and peac as that gloriou sunlight had broken on her ey
so had anoth light of freedom arisen in her soul she wa no longer
afraid of jacob meyer that coward kiss of hi had struck off the
shackl which bound her to him her mind had been subject to hi mind
but now that hi physic natur wa brought into the plai hi mental
part had lost it hold upon her
as she approach the hut she saw her father seat on a stone outsid
it sinc the poor old man wa now so weak and full of pain that he
could not stand for veri long and see rememb meyer threat
against him at the thought all her newfound happi depart
she might be safe she felt sure that she wa safe but how about her
father if meyer could not get hi wai probabl he would be as good as
hi word and kill him she shiver at the thought then recov
herself walk forward steadili with her bucket of water
you have been a long while gone my love said mr clifford
ye father mr meyer wa in the cave and kept me
how did he get there and what did he want
i dont know how he got therecrept in when we were not look i
suppos but as for what he wantedlisten dear and word for word she
told him what had pass
befor she had finish her father wa almost choke with wrath
the dirti jew the villain he gasp i never dream that he would
dare to attempt such an outrag well thank heaven i can still hold a
rifl and when he come out
father she said gentli that man is mad he is not respons for
hi action and therefor except in selfdef you must not think
of such a thing as for what he said about you i believ it wa onli
an empti threat and for me you need have no fear hi power over me is
gone it went like a flash when hi lip touch me and she rub her
own as though to wipe awai some stain i am afraid of noth more i
believey i believ the old molimo wa right and that all will end
well
as she wa speak benita heard a shuffl sound behind her and
turn to learn it caus then she saw a strang sight jacob meyer wa
stagger toward them drag on foot after the other through the
grass and stone hi face wa ghastli pale hi jaw had drop like
that of a dead man and hi ey were set wide open and full of horror
what is the matter with you man ask mr clifford
iihav seen a ghost he whisper you did not come back into the
cave did you he ad point at benita who shook her head
what ghost ask mr clifford
i dont know but my lamp went out and then a light began to shine
behind me i turn and on the step of that crucifix i saw a woman
kneel her arm clasp the feet of the figur her forehead rest
upon the feet her long black hair flow down she wa dress in
white and the light came from her bodi and her head veri slowli she
turn and look at me and oh heaven that face and he put
hi hand befor hi ey and groan it wa beauti ye ye but
fear to see like an aveng angel i fled and the lightonli the
lightcam with me down the cave even at the mouth of it there wa a
littl i have seen a spirit i who did not believ in spirit i have
seen a spirit and i tell you that not for all the gold in the world
will i enter that place again
then befor thei could answer suddenli as though hi fear had got some
fresh hold of him jacob sprang forward and fled awai crash through
the bush and leap from rock to rock like a frighten buck
xxi
the messag from the dead
meyer alwai said that he did not believ in spirit remark mr
clifford reflect
well he believ in them now answer benita with a littl laugh
but father the poor man is mad that is the fact of it and we must
pai no attent to what he sai
the old molimo and some of hi peopletama for instancedeclar
that thei have seen the ghost of benita da ferreira ar thei mad also
benita
i dont know father who can sai all these thing ar a mysteri
all i do know is that i have never seen a ghost and i doubt if i ever
shall
no but when you were in that tranc someth that wa not you spoke
out of your mouth which someth said that it wa your namesak the
other benita well as you sai we cant fathom these thing especi
in a haunt kind of place like thi but the upshot of it is that i
dont think we have much more to fear from jacob
i am not so sure father mad peopl chang their mood veri suddenli
as it happen benita wa quit right toward suppertim jacob meyer
reappear look pale and shaken but otherwis much as usual
i had a kind of fit thi morn he explain the result of an
hallucin which seiz me when my light went out in that cave i
rememb that i thought i had seen a ghost wherea i know veri
well that no such thing exist i wa the victim of disappoint
anxieti and other still stronger emot and he look at benita
therefor pleas forget anyth i said or did andwould you give me
some supper
benita did so and he at in silenc with some hearti when he had
finish hi food and swallow two or three tot of squarefac he
spoke again
i have come here where i know i am not welcom upon busi he
said in a calm matteroffact voic i am tire of thi place and
i think it is time that we attain the object of our journei here
name to find the hidden gold that as we all know can onli be done
in a certain wai through the clairvoy power of on of us and the
hypnot power of anoth miss clifford i request that you will allow
me to throw you into a state of tranc you have told us everyth
els but you have not yet told us where the treasur is hidden and
thi it is necessari that we should know
and if i refus mr meyer
then i am sorri but i must take mean to compel your obedi under
those circumst much against my will i shall be obligedher
hi ey blaze out wildlyto execut your father whose obstinaci
and influenc stand between us and splendid fortun no clifford he
ad dont stretch out your hand toward that rifl for i am alreadi
cover you with the pistol in my pocket and the moment your hand
touch it i shall fire you poor old man do you imagin for a singl
second that sick as you ar and with your stiff limb you can hope to
match yourself against my agil intellect and strength why i could
kill you in a dozen wai befor you could lift a finger against me and
by the god i do not believ in unless your daughter is more compliant
kill you i will
that remain to be seen my friend said mr clifford with a laugh
for he wa a brave old man i am not certain that the godwhom you do
not believ inwil not kill you first
now benita who had been take counsel with herself look up and said
suddenli
veri well mr meyer i consentbecaus i must tomorrow morn you
shall try to mesmer me if you can in the same place befor the
crucifix in the cave
no he answer quickli it wa not there it wa here and here it
shall be again the spot you mention is unpropiti to me the attempt
would fail
it is the spot that i have chosen answer benita stubbornli
and thi is the spot that i have chosen miss clifford and my will
must prevail over your
becaus you who do not believ in spirit ar afraid to reenter the
cave mr meyer lest you should chanc
never mind what i am or am not afraid of he repli with furi make
your choic between do my will and your father life tomorrow
morn i shall come for your answer and if you ar still obstin
within half an hour he will be dead leav you and me alon togeth
oh you mai call me wick and a villain but it is you who ar wick
you you you who forc me to thi deed of justic
then without anoth word he sprang up and walk awai from them
backward as he went cover mr clifford with the pistol which he
had drawn from hi pocket the last that thei saw of him were hi ey
which glower at them through the dark like those of a lion
father said benita when she wa sure that he had gone that madman
realli mean to murder you there is no doubt of it
none whatev dear if i am aliv tomorrow night i shall be lucki
unless i can kill him first or get out of hi wai
well she said hurriedli i think you can i have an idea he is
afraid to go into that cave i am sure let us hide ourselv there
we can take food and shall have plenti of water wherea unless rain
fall he can get noth to drink
but what then benita we cant stop in the dark for ever
no but we can wait there until someth happen someth must and
will happen hi diseas wont stand still he mai go rave mad and
kill himself or he mai attempt to attack us though that is not like
and then we must do what we can in self defenc or help mai reach us
from somewher at the worst we shall onli die as we should have di
outsid come let us be quick lest he should chang hi mind and
creep back upon us
so mr clifford gave wai know that even if he could steel himself
to do the deed of attempt to kill jacob he would have littl chanc
against that strong and agil man such a struggl would onli end in hi
own death and benita must then be left alon with meyer and hi insan
passion
hurriedli thei carri their few belong into the cave first
thei took most of the littl store of food that remain the three
handlamp and all the paraffin there wa but on tin then return
thei fetch the bucket the ammunit and their cloth afterward
as there wa still no sign of meyer thei even dare to drag in the
waggon tent to make a shelter for benita and all the wood that thei
had collect for fire thi prove a wearisom busi for the log
were heavi and in hi crippl state mr clifford could carri no great
burden inde toward the end benita wa forc to complet the task
alon while he limp besid her with hi rifl lest jacob should
surpris them
when at length everyth wa done it wa long past midnight and so
exhaust were thei that notwithstand their danger thei flung
themselv down upon the canva tent which lai in a heap at the end of
the cave near the crucifix and fell asleep
when benita woke the lamp had gone out and it wa pitch dark
fortun howev she rememb where she had put the match and
the lantern with a candl in it she lit the candl and look at her
watch it wa nearli six oclock the dawn must be break outsid
within an hour or two jacob meyer would find that thei had gone suppos
that hi rage should overcom hi fear and that he should creep upon
them thei would know noth of it until hi face appear in the faint
ring of light or he might even shoot her father out of the dark
what could she do that would give them warn a thought came to her
take on of the tent rope and the lantern for her father still slept
heavili she went down to the entranc of the cave and at the end of
the last zigzag where onc a door had been manag to make it fast to a
stone hing about eighteen inch abov the floor and on the other side
to an ey opposit that wa cut in the solid rock to receiv a bolt of
wood or iron meyer she knew had no lamp or oil onli match and
perhap a few candl therefor if he tri to enter the cave it wa
probabl that he would trip over the rope and thu give them warn
then she went back wash her face and hand with some water that thei
had drawn on the previou night to satisfi their thirst and tidi
herself as best she could thi done as her father still slept she
fill the lamp lit on of them and look about her for she wa
loth to wake him
truli it wa an aw place in which to dwell there abov them tower
the great white crucifix there in the corner were pile the remain of
the portugues a skull with long hair still hang to it grin at
her a wither hand wa thrust forward as though to clutch her oh no
wonder that in such a spot jacob meyer had seen ghost in front too
wa the yawn grave where thei had found the monk inde hi bone
wrap in dark robe still lai within for jacob had tumbl them back
again then beyond and all around deep dark and utter silenc
at last her father woke and glad enough wa she of hi human compani
thei breakfast upon some biscuit and water and afterward while mr
clifford watch near the entranc with hi rifl benita set to work
to arrang their belong the tent she manag to prop up against the
wall of the cave by help of some of the wood which thei had carri in
beneath it she spread their blanket that it might serv as a sleep
place for them both and outsid place the food and other thing
while she wa thu engag she heard a sound at the mouth of the
cavejacob meyer wa enter and had fallen over her rope down it
she ran lantern in hand to her father who with hi rifl rais wa
shout
if you come in here i put a bullet through you
then came the answer in jacob voic which rang hollow in that vault
place
i do not want to come in i shall wait for you to come out you cannot
live long in there the horror of the dark will kill you i have onli to
sit in the sunlight and wait
then he laugh and thei heard the sound of hi footstep retreat
down the passag
what ar we to do ask mr clifford despairingli we cannot live
without light and if we have light he will certainli creep to the
entranc and shoot us he is quit mad now i am sure of it from hi
voic
benita thought a minut then she answer
we must build up the passag look and she point to the lump of
rock that the explos of their mine had shaken down from the roof
and the slab of cement that thei had broken from the floor with the
crowbar at onc at onc she went on he will not come back for
some hour probabl not till night
so thei set to work and never did benita labour as it wa her lot to do
that dai such of the fragment as thei could lift thei carri between
them other thei roll along by help of the crowbar for hour after
hour thei toil at their task luckili for them the passag wa not
more than three feet wide by six feet six high and their materi wa
ampl befor the even thei had block it complet with a wall
sever feet in thick which wall thei support on the insid with
length of the firewood lash across to the old hing and bolthol
or set obliqu against it face
it wa done and thei regard their work with pride although it seem
probabl that thei were build up their own tomb becaus of it
posit at an angl of the passag thei knew that meyer could not get
to it with a pole to batter it down also there wa no loos powder
left so hi onli chanc would be to pull it to piec with hi hand
and thi thei thought might be beyond hi power at least should he
attempt it thei would have ampl warn yet that dai wa not to pass
without anoth troubl
just as thei had roll up and lever into place a long fragment of
rock design to prevent the end of their support piec of wood
from slip on the cement floor mr clifford utter an exclam
then said
i have wrung my back badli help me to the tent i must lie down
slowli and with great pain thei stagger up the cave mr clifford
lean on benita and a stick till reach the tent at last he
almost fell on to the blanket and remain there practic crippl
now began benita terribl time the worst of all her life everi hour
her father becam more ill even befor thei took refug in the cave
he wa complet broken down and now after thi accid he began to
suffer veri much hi rheumat or sciatica or whatev it wa seem
to settl upon the hurt muscl of hi back caus him so much pain
that he could scarc sleep for ten minut at a stretch moreov he
would swallow but littl of the rough food which wa all benita wa
abl to prepar for him noth inde except biscuit soak in black
coffe which she boil over a small fire made of wood that thei had
brought with them and occasion a littl broth tasteless stuff
enough for it wa onli the essenc of biltong or sundri flesh
flavour with some salt
then there were two other terror against she must fight the dark
and the dread of jacob meyer perhap the dark wa the wors of
them to live in that hideou gloom in which their singl lamp for she
dare burn no more lest the oil should give out seem but as on star
to the whole night ah who that had not endur it could know what it
meant there the sick man yonder the grin skeleton around the
black and the silenc and beyond these again a miser death
or jacob meyer but of him benita saw noth though onc or twice she
thought that she heard hi voic rave outsid the wall which thei had
built if so either he did not try to pull it down or he fail in
the attempt or perhap he fear that should he succe he would be
greet by a bullet so at last she gave up think about him should
he forc hi wai into the cave she must deal with the situat as best
she could meanwhil her father strength wa sink fast
three aw dai went by in thi fashion and the end drew near
although she tri to forc herself to it benita could not swallow
enough food to keep up her strength now that the passag wa close the
atmospher of thi old vault for it wa noth more thicken by
the smoke of the fire which she wa oblig to burn grew poison and
choke her want of sleep exhaust her dread of what the morrow might
bring forth crush her strong spirit she began to break down know
that the hour wa near when she and her father must die togeth
onc as she slept awhil at hi side be waken by hi groan
benita look at her watch it wa midnight she rose and go to the
ember of the littl fire warm up some of her biltong broth which she
pour into a tin pannikin with difficulti she forc him to swallow
a few mouth of it then feel a sudden weak drank the rest
herself it gave her power to think and her father doze off into an
uneasi sleep
ala think wa of no us noth could be done there wa no hope
save in prayer restless seiz benita and take the lantern she
wander round the cave the wall that thei had built remain intact
and oh to think that beyond it flow the free air and shone the
bless star back she came again skirt the pit that jacob meyer
had dug and the grave of the old monk till she reach the step of
the crucifix and hold up her candl look at the thorncrown
brow of the christ abov
it wa wonderfulli carv that dy face wa full of piti would not
he whom it repres piti her she knelt down on the topmost step and
clasp the pierc feet with her arm began to prai earnestli not
for herself but that she might save her father she prai as she had
never prai befor and so prai sank into a torpor or a swoon
it seem to benita that thi sleep of her suddenli becam aliv in it
she saw mani thing for instanc she saw herself seat in a state of
tranc upon that veri step where now she knelt while befor her stood
her father and jacob meyer moreov someth spoke in her she could
not hear a voic but she seem to see the word written in the air
befor her these were the word
clasp the feet of the christ and draw them to the left the passag
beneath lead to the chamber where the gold is hid and thenc to the
river bank that is the secret which er i depart i the dead benita
pass on to you the live benita as i am command in life and death
peac be to your soul
thrice did thi messag appear to repeat itself in the conscious
of benita then suddenli as she had slept she woke again with everi
letter of it imprint on her mind doubtless it wa a dream noth
but a dream bred by the fact that her arm were clasp the feet of the
crucifix what did it sai draw them to the left
she did so but noth stir again she tri and still noth
stir of cours it wa a dream why had such been sent to mock her
in a kind of mad irrit she put out all her remain strength and
wrestl with those stoni feet thei move a littlethen of a sudden
without ani further effort on her part swung round as high as the knee
where draperi hung conceal the join in them ye thei swung round
reveal the head of a stair up which blew a cold wind that it wa
sweet to breath
benita rose gasp then she seiz her lantern and ran to the littl
tent where her father lai
xxii
the voic of the live
mr clifford wa awak again now
where have you been he ask querul in a thin voic i want
you then as the light from the candl shone upon it he note the
chang that had come over her pale face and ad what ha happen
is meyer dead ar we free
benita shook her head he wa aliv a few hour ago for i could hear
him rave and shout outsid the wall we built but father it ha
all come back to me i believ that i have found it
what ha come back what have you found ar you mad too like jacob
what someth told me when i wa in the tranc which afterward i
forgot but now rememb and i have found the passag which lead to
where thei hid the gold it begin behind the crucifix where no on
ever thought of look
thi matter of the gold did not seem to interest mr clifford in hi
state all the wealth beneath the soil of africa would not have appeal
to him moreov he hate the name of that accurs treasur which wa
bring them to such a miser end
where doe the passag run have you look he ask
not yet but the voic in me saidi mean i dreamedthat it goe down
to the riversid if you leant on me do you think that you could walk
not on inch he answer here where i am i shall die
no no dont talk like that we mai be save now that i have found
a wai oh if onli you couldif onli you could walk or if i had the
strength to carri you and she wrung her hand and began to weep so
weak wa she
her father look at her searchingli then he said
well love i cannot so there an end but you can and you had
better go
what and leav you never
ye and leav me look there is but a littl oil left and onli a
few candl the biscuit ar done and neither of us can swallow
that biltong ani more i suppos that i am dy and your health and
strength ar fail you quickli in thi dark if you stop here
you must soon follow me and what is the altern the madman
outsidethat is if you could find strength to pull down the wall
which i doubt you had best go benita
but still she said she would not
do you not see he ad that it is my onli chanc of life if you
go you mai be abl to bring me help befor the end come should there
be a passag the probabl is that although thei know noth of
it it finish somewher by the wall of the first enclosur where the
makalanga ar if so you mai find the molimo or if he is dead tama
or on of the other and thei will help us go benita go at onc
i never thought of that she answer in a chang voic of cours
it mai be so if the passag goe down at all well at least i can look
and come back to tell you
then benita place the remaind of the oil close by her father
side so that he could refil the lamp for the us of hi hand still
remain to him also she set there such crumb of biscuit as were
left some of the biltong a flask of holland and a pail of water
thi done she put on her long cloak fill on of it pocket with
biltong and the other with match and three of the four remain
candl the fourth she insist on leav besid her father bed
when everyth wa readi she knelt down at hi side kiss him and
from her heart put up a prayer that thei might both live to meet again
although she knew well that thi thei could scarc hope to do
had two peopl ever been in a more dread situat she wonder as
she look at her father ly there whom she must leav to fight with
death alon in that aw place while she went forth to meet him in the
unknown bowel of the earth
mr clifford read her thought ye he said it is a strang part
and a wild errand but who know it mai pleas provid to take you
through and if notwhi our troubl will soon be over
then onc more thei kiss and not dare to try to speak benita tore
herself awai pass into the passag whereof the lower half of the
crucifix form the door she paus for a moment to examin it and to
place a fragment of rock in such fashion that it could not shut again
behind her her idea wa that it work by aid of some spring but now
she saw that thi wa not so as the whole mass hung upon three stone
hing beautifulli conceal the dust and corros of ag which had
made thi door so hard to open by fill up the tini space between it
and it framework had also render these crack utterli impercept
to the ey so accur wa it fashion inde that no on who did
not know it secret would have discov it if thei search for month
or year
though at the time benita took littl note of such detail the
passag beyond and the stair descend from it show the same perfect
workmanship evid thi secret wai date not from the portugues
period but from that of the phoenician or other ancient to whose
treasurechamb it wa the approach open as it did from their
holi of holi to which none were admit save the head priest the
passag which wa about seven feet high by four wide had been hewn out
of the live rock of the mountain for thousand of littl mark left by
the workmen chisel were still discern upon it wall so it wa
with the stair that had been but littl us and remain fresh as the
dai when it wa finish
down the step candl in hand flit benita count them as she
went the thirtieth brought her to a land here it wa that she saw
the first trace of that treasur which thei had suffer so much to
find someth glitter at her feet she pick it up it wa a littl
bar of gold weigh two or three ounc that doubtless had been drop
there throw it down again she look in front of her and to her
dismai saw a door of wood with iron bolt but the bolt had never been
shot and when she pull at it the door creak upon it rusti hing
and open she wa on the threshold of the treasurechamb
it wa squar and of the size of a small room pack on either side
almost to the low vault roof with small bag of raw hide carelessli
arrang quit near to the door on of these bag had slip down
and burst open it wa fill with gold some in ingot and some in raw
nugget for there thei lai in a shine scatter heap as she stoop
to look it came into the mind of benita that her father had said that in
her tranc she had told them that on of the bag of treasur wa burst
and that the skin of which it had been made wa black and red behold
befor her lai the burst bag and the colour of the hide wa black and
red
she shiver the thing wa uncanni terribl uncanni wa it also
to see in the thick dust which in the cours of twenti or more of
centuri had gather on the floor the mark of footprint those of
the last person who had visit thi place there had been two of them
a man and a woman and thei were no savag for thei wore shoe benita
place her foot in the print left by that dead woman it fill it
exactli it might have been her own perhap she thought to herself
that other benita had descend here with her father after the
portugues had hidden awai their wealth that she might be shown where
it wa and of what it consist
on more glanc at all thi priceless miserywork gold and on she
went she who wa seek the gold of life and liberti for herself and
him who lai abov suppos that the stairwai end there she stop
she look round but could see no other door to see the better she
halt and open the glass of her lantern still she could perceiv
noth and her heart sank yet why did the candl flicker so fierc
and why wa the air in thi deep place so fresh she walk forward a
pace or two then notic suddenli that those footprint of the dead
that she wa follow disappear immedi in front of her and she
stop
it wa but just in time on step more and she would have fallen down
the mouth of a deep pit onc it had been cover with a stone but thi
stone wa remov and had never been replac look there it stood
against the wall of the chamber well wa thi for benita sinc her
frail strength would not have suffic to stir that massiv block even
if she had discov it exist beneath the dust
now she saw that down the pit ran anoth ladderlik stair of stone
veri narrow and precipit without hesit she began it descent
down she went and downon hundr step two hundr step two
hundr and seventyf step and all the wai wherev the dust had
gather the man and the woman footprint ran befor her there wa
a doubl line of them on line go down and the other line return
those that return were the last for often thei appear over those
that descend why had these dead peopl return benita wonder
the stair had end now she wa in a kind of natur cave for it
side and roof were rug moreov water trickl and drip from
them it wa not veri larg and it smelt horribl of mud and other
thing again she search by the feebl light of her candl but could
see no exit suddenli she saw someth els howev for step
on what she took to be a rock to her horror it move beneath her she
heard a snap as of jaw a violent blow upon the leg nearli knock
her off her feet and as she stagger backward she saw a huge and
loathsom shape rush awai into the dark the rock that she had
trodden on wa a crocodil which had it den here with a littl scream
she retreat to her stair death she had expectedbut to be eaten by
crocodil
yet as benita stood there pant a bless hope rose in her breast if
a crocodil came in there it must also get out and where such a great
creatur could go a woman would be abl to follow also she must be
near the water sinc otherwis it could never have chosen thi hole for
it habit she collect her courag and have clap her hand
and wave the lantern about to scare ani allig that might still be
lurk there hear and see noth more she descend to where
she had trodden upon the reptil evid thi wa it bed for
it long bodi had left an impress upon the mud and all about lai the
remain of creatur that it had brought in for food moreov a path
ran outward it wellworn trail distinct even in that light
she follow thi path which end appar in a blank wall then it
wa that benita guess why those dead folk footprint had return
for here had been a doorwai which in some past ag those who us it
built up with block of stone and cement how then did the crocodil
get out stoop down she search and perceiv a few yard to the
right of the door a hole that look as though it were waterworn
now benita thought that she understood the rock wa softer here and
centuri of flood had eaten it awai leav a crack in the stratum
which the crocodil had found out and enlarg down she went on her
hand and knee and thrust the lantern in front of her crept along
that noisom drain for thi wa what it resembl and nowoh now she
felt air blow in her face and heard the sound of reed whisper
and water run and saw hang like a lamp in the blue sky
a starth morn star benita could have wept she could have
worship it yet she push on between rock till she found herself
among tall reed and stand in water she had gain the bank of the
zambesi
instantli by instinct as it were benita extinguish her candl
fear lest it should betrai her for constant danger had made her veri
cun the dawn had not yet broken but the wane moon and the star
gave a good light she paus to look there abov her tower the
outermost wall of bambats against which the river wash except at
such time as the present when it wa veri low
so she wa not in the fortress as she had hope but without it and oh
what should she do go back again how would that serv her father or
herself go on then she might fall into the hand of the matabel whose

befor the matabel caught her she would not go back emptyhand to
die in that dread place with her poor father better perish here in
the sweet air and beneath the star even if it were upon a matabel

she look about her to take her bear in case it should ever be
necessari for her to return to the entranc of the cave thi prove

match and thrown them about insid of it that the smell of them might
scare the beast should it wish to return she set her lantern behind a
stone near to the mouth of the hole
then benita began her journei which when the river wa high it would
not have been possibl for her to make except by swim as it wa
a margin of marsh wa left between her and the steep rocki side of the
mount from which the great wall rose and through thi she made her wai

so men depart to fetch those cow and oxen which present were
driven in
while thi talk wa in progress the great impi of the matabel wa
mass for the march on the flat ground a littl to the right of
them now thei began to come past in compani preced by the lad
who carri the mat and cookingpot and drove the captur sheep and
cattl by thi time the stori of benita the witchwoman whom thei
could not kill and who had mysteri flown from the top of the peak

to benita stand upon the waggonbox
inde thei were a wondrou and impos spectacl such a on as few

rather runningalong the bank of the zambesi
why do you not come quicker she ask impati oh i beg your
pardon you ar lame robert what made you lame and oh why ar you
not dead as thei all swore you were you youhero for i know that
part of the stori
for a veri simpl reason benita becaus i didnt die when that
kaffir took the watch from me i wa insens that all the sun
brought me to life afterward then some nativ turn up good peopl
in their wai although i could not understand a word thei said thei
made a stretcher of bough and carri me for some mile to their kraal
inland it hurt awfulli for my thigh wa broken but i arriv at last
there a kaffir doctor set my leg in hi own fashion it ha left it an
inch shorter than the other but that better than noth
in that place i lai for two solid month for there wa no white
man within a hundr mile and if there had been i could not have
commun with him afterward i spent anoth month limp up
toward natal until i could bui a hors the rest is veri short
hear of my report death i came as fast as i could to your father
farm rooi krantz where i learn from the old vrouw salli that you had
taken to treasurehunt the same treasur that i told you of on the
zanzibar
so i follow your spoor met the servant whom you had sent back who
told me all about you and in due cours after mani adventur as thei
sai in a book walk into the camp of our friend the matabel
thei were go to kill me at onc when suddenli you appear upon
that point of rock glitter likelik the angel of the dawn i knew
that it must be you for i had found out about your attempt escap
and how you were hunt back to thi place but the matabel all thought
that it wa the spirit of bambats who ha a great reput in these
part well that took off their attent and afterward as i told
you it occur to them that i might be an engin you know the rest
dont you
ye answer benita softli i know the rest
then thei plung into the reed and were oblig to stop talk sinc
thei must walk in singl file present benita look up and saw that
she wa under the thorn which grew in the cleft of the rock also with
some troubl she found the bunch of reed that she had bent down to
mark the inconspicu hole through which she had crept and by it her
lantern it seem week sinc she had left it there
now she said light your candl and if you see a crocodil pleas
shoot
xxiv
the true gold
let me go first said robert
no answer benita i know the wai but pleas do watch for that
horribl crocodil
then she knelt down and crept into the hole while after her came
robert and after him the two zulu who protest that thei were not
antbear to burrow under ground lift the lantern she search the
cave and as she could see no sign of the crocodil walk on boldli
to where the stair began
be quick she whisper to robert for in that place it seem natur
to speak low my father is abov and near hi death i am dreadfulli
afraid lest we should be too late
so thei toil up the endless step a veri strang process for the
two zulu bold men enough outsid were shake with fright till at
length benita clamber out of the trap door on to the floor of the
treasur chamber and turn to help robert whose lame made him
somewhat slow and awkward
what all that he ask point to the hide sack while thei
wait for the two scare kaffir to join them
oh she answer indiffer gold i believ look there is some
of it on the floor over benita da ferreira footstep
gold why it must be worth and who on earth is benita da
ferreira
i will tell you afterward she ha been dead two or three hundr
year it wa her gold or her peopl and those ar her footprint in
the dust how stupid you ar not to understand never mind the hate
stuff come on quickli
so thei pass the door which she had open that morn and clamber
up the remain stairwai so full wa benita of terror that she
could never rememb how she climb them suppos that the foot of the
crucifix had swung to suppos that her father were dead suppos that
jacob meyer had broken into the cave well for herself she wa no longer
afraid of jacob meyer oh thei were there the heavi door had begun
to close but mercifulli her bit of rock kept it ajar
father father she cri run toward the tent
no answer came she threw asid the flap held down the lantern and
look there he lai white and still she wa too late
he is dead he is dead she wail robert knelt down at her side and
examin the old man while she wait in an agoni
he ought to be he said slowli but benita i dont think he is i

squarefac and here mix it with thi milk
she obei and while he held up her father head with a trembl
hand empti a littl of the drink into hi mouth at first it ran out
again then almost automat he swallow some and thei knew that
he wa aliv and thank heaven ten minut later mr clifford wa
sit up stare at them with dull and wonder ey while
outsid the two zulu whose nerv had now utterli broken down were
contempl the pile of skeleton in the corner and the white tower
crucifix and loudli lament that thei should have been brought to

much labour when it wa nearli down the zulu were told that there wa
an enemi outsid and that thei must help to catch him if necessari but
were not to harm him thei assent gladli enough inde to get out of

littl light that penetr there he drew hi revolv and beckon
the kaffir to follow down the passag thei crept slowli lest thei
should be blind when thei came to the glare of the sunshin while

a littl time went by she never knew how long till suddenli a rifl
shot rang through the still benita wa abl to bear no more she
