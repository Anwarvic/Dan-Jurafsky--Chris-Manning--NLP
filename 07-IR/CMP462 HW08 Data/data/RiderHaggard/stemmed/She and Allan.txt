note by the late mr allan quatermain
my friend into whose hand i hope that all these manuscript of mine
will pass on dai of thi on i have someth to sai to you
a long while ago i jot down in it the histori of the event that
it detail with more or less complet thi i did for my own
satisfact you will have note how memori fail us as we advanc
in year we recollect with an almost pain exactitud what we
experienc and saw in our youth but the happen of our middl
life slip awai from us or becom blur like a stretch of lowli
landscap overflow by grei and nebul mist far off the sun still
seem to shine upon the plain and hill of adolesc and earli
manhood as yet it shine about us in the fleet hour of our ag
that ground on which we stand todai but the vallei between is fill
with fog ye even it promin which symbolis the more startl
event of that past often ar lost in thi confus fog
it wa an appreci of these truth which led me to set down the
follow detail though of cours much is omit of my brief
intercours with the strang and splendid creatur whom i knew under the
name of ayesha or hya or shewhocommand not inde with ani
view to their public but befor i forgot them that if i wish to
do so i might reperus them in the even of old ag to which i hope
to attain
inde at the time the last thing i intend wa that thei should be
given to the world even after my own death becaus thei or mani of
them ar so unusu that i fear lest thei should caus smile and
in a wai cast a slur upon my memori and truth also as you will
read as to thi matter i made a promis and i have alwai tri to
keep my promis and to guard the secret of other for these reason i
propos in case i neglect or forgot to destroi them myself to leav
a direct that thi should be done by my executor further i have
been care to make no allus whatev to them either in casual
convers or in anyth els that i mai have written my desir
be that thi page of my life should be kept quit privat someth
known onli to myself therefor too i never so much as hint of them
to anyon not even to yourself to whom i have told so much
well i record the main fact concern thi expedit and it
issu simpli and with as much exact as i could and laid them
asid i do not sai that i never thought of them again sinc amongst
them were some which togeth with the problem thei suggest prove
to be of an unforgett natur
also whenev ani of ayesha sai or stori which ar not
preserv in these page came back to me as ha happen from time to
time i jot them down and put them awai with thi manuscript thu
among these note you will find a histori of the citi of kr as she told
it to me which i have omit here still mani of these remark
event did more or less fade from my mind as the imag doe from
an unfix photograph till onli their outlin remain faint if
distinguish
to tell the truth i wa rather asham of the whole stori in which
i cut so poor a figur on reflect it wa obviou to me although
honesti had compel me to set out all that is essenti exactli as it
occur ad noth and take noth awai that i had been the
victim of veri gross deceit thi strang woman whom i had met in the
ruin of a place call kr without ani doubt had thrown a glamour over
my sens and at the moment almost caus me to believ much that is
quit unbeliev
for instanc she had told me ridicul stori as to interview
between herself and certain heathen goddess though it is true that
almost with her next breath these she qualifi or contradict also
she had suggest that her life had been prolong far beyond our mortal
span for hundr and hundr of year inde which as euclid sai
is absurd and had pretend to supernatur power which is still more
absurd moreov by a clever us of some hypnot or mesmer power
she had feign to transport me to some place beyond the earth and in
the hall of hade to show me what is veil from the ey of man
and not onli me but the savag warrior umhlopekazi commonli call
umslopogaa of the ax who with han a hottentot wa my companion
upon that adventur there were like thing equal incred such as
her appear when all seem lost in the battl with the trolllik
rezu to omit these the sum of it wa that i had been shamefulli dupe
and if anyon find himself in that posit as most peopl have at on
time or anoth in their live wisdom suggest that he had better keep
the circumst to himself
well so the matter stood or rather lai in the recess of my mindand
in the cupboard where i hide my paperswhen on even someon as a
matter of fact it wa captain good an individu of romant tendenc
who is fond sometim i think too fond of fiction brought a book to
thi hous which he insist over and over again realli i must perus
ascertain that it wa a novel i declin for to tell the truth i am
not fond of romanc in ani shape be a person who ha found the hard
fact of life of suffici interest as thei stand
read i admit i like but in thi matter as in everyth els my
rang is limit i studi the bibl especi the old testament both
becaus of it sacr lesson and of the majesti of the languag of it
inspir translat whereof that of ayesha which i render so poorli
from her flow and melodi arab remind me for poetri i turn
to shakespear and at the other end of the scale to the ingoldsbi
legend mani of which i know almost by heart while for current affair
i content myself with the newspap
for the rest i perus anyth to do with ancient egypt that i happen to
come across becaus thi land and it histori have a queer fascin
for me that perhap ha it root in occurr or dream of which
thi is not the place to speak lastli now and again i read on of the
latin or greek author in a translat sinc i regret to sai that my
lack of educ doe not enabl me to do so in the origin but for
modern fiction i have no tast although from time to time i sampl it
in a railwai train and occasion am amus by such excurs into
the poetic and unreal
so it came about that the more good bother me to read thi particular
romanc the more i determin that i would do noth of the sort
be a persist person howev when he went awai about ten oclock
at night he deposit it by my side under my nose inde so that it
might not be overlook thu it came about that i could not help see
some egyptian hieroglyph in an oval on the cover also the titl
and underneath it your own name my friend all of which excit
my curios especi the titl which wa brief and enigmat
consist inde of on word she
i took up the work and on open it the first thing my ey fell upon
wa a pictur of a veil woman the sight of which made my heart stand
still so painfulli did it remind me of a certain veil woman whom onc
it had been my fortun to meet glanc from it to the print page on
word seem to leap at me it wa kr now of veil women there ar
plenti in the world but were there also two kr
then i turn to the begin and began to read thi happen in
the autumn when the sun doe not rise till about six but it wa broad
daylight befor i ceas from read or rather rush through that
book
oh what wa i to make of it for here in it page to sai noth of
old billali who by the wai li probabl to order when he told mr
holli that no white man had visit hi countri for mani gener
and those gloomi maneat amahagg scoundrel onc again i
found myself face to face with shewhocommand now render as
shewhomustbeobei which mean much the same thingin her case
at least ye with ayesha the love the mystic the chang and the
imperi
moreov the histori fill up mani gap in my own limit experi
of that enigmat be who wa half divin though i think rather
wick or at ani rate unmor in her wai and yet all woman it is true
that it show her in light veri differ from and higher than those
in which she had present herself to me yet the substratum of her
charact wa the same or rather of her charact for of these she
seem to have sever in a singl bodi be as she said of herself
to me not on but mani and not here but everywher
further i found the stori of kallikr which i had set down as a
mere falsehood invent for my bewilder expand and explain or
rather not explain sinc perhap that she might deceiv to me
she had spoken of thi murder kallikr without enthusiasm as a
handsom person to whom becaus of an indiscret of her youth she
wa bound by destini and whose returnsomewhat to her sorrowsh must
wait at least she did so at first though in the end when she bare her
heart at the moment of our farewel she vow she love him onli and
wa appoint to him by a divin decre
also i found other thing of which i knew noth such as the fire of
life with it fatal gift of indefinit exist although i rememb
that like the giant rezu whom umslopogaa defeat she did talk of a
cup of life of which she had drunk that might have been offer to my
lip had i been polit bow the knee and shown more faith in her and
her supernatur pretens
lastli i saw the stori of her end and as i read it i wept ye i
confess i wept although i feel sure that she will return again now i
understood why she had quail and even seem to shrivel when in my
last interview with her stung beyond endur by her witcheri and
sarcasm i had suggest that even for her with all her power fate
might reserv on of it shrewdest blow some prescienc had told her
that if the word seem random truth spoke through my lip although
and thi wa the worst of it she did not know what weapon would deal
the stroke or when and where it wa doom to fall
i wa amaz i wa overcom but as i close that book i made up my
mind first that i would continu to preserv absolut silenc as to
ayesha and my deal with her as dure my life i wa bound by
oath to do and secondli that i would not caus my manuscript to be
destroi i did not feel that i had ani right to do so in view of what
alreadi had been publish to the world there let it lie to appear on
dai or not to appear as might be fate meanwhil my lip were seal
i would give good back hi book without comment andbui anoth copi
on more word it is clear that i did not touch more than the fring
of the real ayesha in a thousand wai she bewitch and deceiv me so
that i never plumb her natur depth perhap thi wa my own fault
becaus from the first i shew a lack of faith in her and she wish to
pai me back in her own fashion or perhap she had other privat reason
for her secreci certainli the charact she discov to me differ
in mani wai from that which she reveal to mr holli and to leo
vincei or kallikr whom it seem onc she slew in her jealousi
and rage
she told me as much as she thought it fit that i should know and no
more

chapter i
the talisman
i believ it wa the old egyptian a veri wise peopl probabl inde
much wiser than we know for in the leisur of their ampl centuri
thei had time to think out thing who declar that each individu
person is made up of six or seven differ element although the
bibl onli allow us three name bodi soul and spirit the bodi
that the man or woman wore if i understand their theori aright which
perhap i an ignor person do not wa but a kind of sack or fleshli
cover contain these differ principl or mayhap it did not
contain them all but wa simpli a hous as it were in which thei live
from time to time and seldom all togeth although on or more of them
wa present continu as though to keep the place warm and air
thi is but a casual illustr suggest for what right have
i allan quatermain out of my littl read and probabl erron
deduct to form ani judgment as to the theori of the old
egyptian still these as i understand them suffic to furnish me with
the text that man is not on but mani in which connect it mai be
rememb that often in scriptur he is spoken of as be the home of
mani demon seven i think also to come to anoth faroff exampl
the zulu talk of their witchdoctor as be inhabit by a multitud
of spirit
anyhow of on thing i am quit sure we ar not alwai the same
differ person actuat us at differ time in on hour
passion of thi sort or the other is our lord in anoth we ar reason
itself in on hour we follow the basest appetit in anoth we hate
them and the spirit aris through our mortal murk shine within or
abov us like a star in on hour our desir is to kill and spare not
in anoth we ar fill with the holiest compass even toward an
insect or a snake and ar readi to forgiv like a god everyth
rule us in turn to such an extent inde that sometim on begin to
wonder whether we realli rule anyth
now the reason of all thi homili is that i allan the most practic
and unimagin of person just a home halfeduc hunter and
trader who chanc to have seen a good deal of the particular littl
world in which hi lot wa cast at on period of my life becam the
victim of spiritu long
i am a man who ha suffer great bereav in my time such as have
sear my soul sinc perhap becaus of my rather primit and simpl
natur my affect ar veri strong by dai or night i can never
forget those whom i have love and whom i believ to have love me
for you know in our vaniti some of us ar apt to hold that certain
peopl with whom we have been intim upon the earth realli did
care for us and in our still greater vanityor should it be call
madnessto imagin that thei still care for us after thei have left
the earth and enter on some new state of societi and surround
which if thei exist inferenti ar much more congeni than ani
thei can have experienc here at time howev cold doubt strike us
as to thi matter of which we long to know the truth also behind loom
a still blacker doubt name whether thei live at all
for some year of my lone exist these problem haunt me dai by
dai till at length i desir abov everyth on earth to lai them
at rest in on wai or anoth onc at durban i met a man who wa a
spiritualist to whom i confid a littl of my perplex he laugh
at me and said that thei could be settl with the greatest eas all
i had to do wa to visit a certain local medium who for a fee of on
guinea would tell me everyth i want to know although i rather
grudg the guinea be more than usual hard up at the time i
call upon thi person but over the result of that visit or rather
the lack of them i draw a veil
my queer and perhap unwholesom long howev remain with me and
would not be abat i consult a clergyman of my acquaint a good
and spirituallymind man but he could onli shrug hi shoulder and
refer me to the bibl sai quit rightli i doubt not that with what
it reveal i ought to be content then i read certain mystic
book which were recommend to me these were full of fine word
undiscover in a pocket dictionari but realli took me no forward
sinc in them i found noth that i could not have invent myself
although while i wa actual studi them thei seem to convinc
me i even tackl swedenborg or rather sampl of him for he is veri
copiou but without satisfactori result hajb
then i gave up the busi
some month later i wa in zululand and be near the black kloof
where he dwelt i paid a visit to my acquaint of whom i have
written elsewher the wonder and ancient dwarf zikali known as
thethingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn also more univers
among the zulu as openerofroad when we had talk of mani thing
connect with the state of zululand and it polit i rose to leav
for my waggon sinc i never care for sleep in the black kloof if it
could be avoid
is there noth els that you want to ask me macumazahn ask
the old dwarf toss back hi long hair and look ati had almost
written throughm
i shook my head
that is strang macumazahn for i seem to see someth written on
your mindsometh to do with spirit
then i rememb all the problem that had been troubl me although
in truth i had never thought of propound them to zikali
ah it come back doe it he exclaim read my thought out
with it then macumazahn while i am in a mood to answer and befor
i grow tire for you ar an old friend of mine and will so remain till
the end mani year henc and if i can serv you i will
i fill my pipe and sat down again upon the stool of carv redwood
which had been brought for me
you ar name openerofroad ar you not zikali i said
ye the zulu have alwai call me that sinc befor the dai of
chaka but what of name which often enough mean noth at all
onli that i want to open a road zikali that which run across the
river of death
oho he laugh it is veri easi and snatch up a littl assegai
that lai besid him he proffer it to me ad be brave now and
fall on that then befor i have count sixti the road will be wide
open but whether you will see anyth on it i cannot tell you
again i shook my head and answer
it is against our law also while i still live i desir to know whether
i shall meet certain other on that road after my time ha come to cross
the river perhap you who deal with spirit can prove the matter to
me which no on els seem abl to do
oho laugh zikali again what do my ear hear am i the poor zulu
cheat as you will rememb onc you call me macumazahn ask
to show that which is hidden from all the wisdom of the great white
peopl
the question is i answer with irrit not what you ar ask
to do but what you can do
that i do not know yet macumazahn whose spirit do you desir to see
if that of a woman call mameena is on of them i think that perhap i
whom she love
for the histori of mameena see the book call child of
stormeditor
she is not on of them zikali moreov if she love you you paid
back her love with death
which perhap wa the kindest thing i could do macumazahn for reason
that you mai be abl to guess and other with which i will not troubl
you but if not her whose let me look let me look why there seem
to be two of them headwiv i mean and i thought that white men onli
took on wife also a multitud of other their face float up in the
water of your mind an old man with grei hair littl children perhap
thei were brother and sister and some who mai be friend also veri
clear inde that mameena whom you do not wish to see well macumazahn
thi is unfortun sinc she is the onli on whom i can show you
or rather put you in the wai of find unless inde there ar other
kaffir women
what do you mean i ask
i mean macumazahn that onli black feet travel on the road which i can
open over those in which ran white blood i have no power
then it is finish i said rise again and take a step or two
toward the gate
come back and sit down macumazahn i did not sai so am i the onli
ruler of magic in africa which i am told is a big countri
i came back and sat down for my curios a great fail with me wa
excit
thank you zikali i said but i will have no deal with more of
your witchdoctor
no no becaus you ar afraid of them quit without reason
macumazahn see that thei ar all cheat except myself i am the last
child of wisdom the rest ar stuf with li as chaka found out when
he kill everi on of them whom he could catch but perhap there might
be a white doctor who would have rule over white spirit
if you mean missionari i began hastili
no macumazahn i do not mean your prai men who ar cast in on
mould and measur with on rule and sai what thei ar taught to sai
not think for themselv
some of them think zikali
ye and then the other fall on them with big stick the real priest
is he to whom the spirit come not he who feed upon it wrap and
speak through a mask carv by hi father father i am a priest like
that which is why all my fellowship have hate me
if so you have paid back their hate zikali but ceas to cast round
the lion like a timid hound and tell me what you mean of whom do you
speak
that is the troubl macumazahn i do not know thi lion or rather
lioness li hid in the cave of a veri distant mountain and i have
never seen herin the flesh
then how can you talk of what you have never seen
in the same wai macumazahn that your priest talk of what thei have
never seen becaus thei or a few of them have knowledg of it i
will tell you a secret all seer who live at the same time if thei ar
great commun with each other becaus thei ar akin and their spirit
meet in sleep or dream therefor i know of a mistress of our craft a
veri lioness among jackal who for thousand of year ha lain sleep
in the northern cave and humbl though i am she know of me
quit so i said yawn but perhap zikali you will come to the
point of the spear what of her how is she name and if she exist
will she help me
i will answer your question backward macumazahn i think that she
will help you if you help her in what wai i do not know becaus
although witchdoctor sometim work without pai as i am do now
macumazahn witchdoctoress never do as for her name the onli on
that she ha among our compani is queen becaus she is the first of
all of them and the most beauteou among women for the rest i can tell
you noth except that she ha alwai been and i suppos in thi
shape or in that will alwai be while the world last becaus she ha
found the secret of life unend
you mean that she is immort zikali i answer with a smile
i do not sai that macumazahn becaus my littl mind cannot shape the
thought of immort but when i wa a babe which is far ago she had
live so long that scarc would she knew the differ between then
and now and alreadi in her breast wa all wisdom gather i know it
becaus although as i have said we have never seen each other at
time we walk togeth in our sleep for thu she share her loneli
and i think though thi mai be but a dream that last night she told me
to send you on to her to seek an answer to certain question which you
would put to me todai also to me she seem to desir that you should
do her a servic i know not what servic
now i grew angri and ask
why doe it pleas you to fool me zikali with such talk as thi if
there is ani truth in it show me where the woman call queen live
and how i am to come to her
the old wizard took up the littl assegai which he had offer to me and
with it blade rake our ash from the fire that alwai burnt in front
of him while he did so he talk to me as i thought in a random
fashion perhap to distract my attent of a certain white man whom
he said i should meet upon my journei and of hi affair also of other
matter none of which interest me much at the time these ash
he pat down flat and then on them drew a map with the point of hi
spear make groov for stream certain mark for bush and forest
wavi line for water and swamp and littl heap for hill
when he had finish it all he bade me come round the fire and studi the
pictur across which by an afterthought he drew a wander furrow with
the edg of the assegai to repres a river and gather the ash in
a lump at the northern end to signifi a larg mountain
look at it well macumazahn he said and forget noth sinc if
you make thi journei and forget you die nai no need to copi it in
that book of your for see i will stamp it on your mind
then suddenli he gather up the warm ash in a doubl hand and
threw them into my face mutter someth as he did so and ad
aloud
there now you will rememb
certainli i shall i answer cough and i beg that you will not
plai such a joke upon me again
as a matter of fact whatev mai have been the reason i never forgot
ani detail of that extrem intric map
that big river must be the zambesi i stutter and even then the
mountain of your queen if it be her mountain is far awai and how can
i come there alon
i dont know macumazahn though perhap you might do so in compani at
least i believ that in the old dai peopl us to travel to the place
sinc i have heard a great citi stood there onc which wa the heart of
a mighti empir
now i prick up my ear for though i believ noth of zikali
stori of a wonder queen i wa alwai intens interest in past
civilis and their relic also i knew that the old wizard
knowledg wa extens and peculiar howev he came by it and i did
not think that he would lie to me in thi matter inde to tell the
truth then and there i made up my mind that if it were in ani wai
possibl i would attempt thi journei
how did peopl travel to the citi zikali
by sea i suppos macumazahn but i think that you will be wise not to
try that road sinc i believ that on the sea side the marsh ar now
impass and you will be safer on your feet
you want me to go on thi adventur zikali why i know you never do
anyth without motiv
oho macumazahn you ar clever and see deeper into the trunk of a tree
than most ye i want you to go for three reason first that you
mai satisfi your soul on certain matter and i would help you to do so
secondli becaus i want to satisfi mine and thirdli becaus i know
that you will come back safe to be a prop to me in thing that will
happen in dai unborn otherwis i would have told you noth of thi
stori sinc it is necessari to me that you should remain live beneath
the sun
have done zikali what is it that you desir
oh a great deal that i shall get but chiefli two thing so with
the rest i will not troubl you first i desir to know to know whether
these dream of mine of a wonder white witchdoctoress or witch and
of my convers with her ar inde more than dream next i would learn
whether certain plot of mine at which i have work for year will
succe
what plot zikali and how can my take a distant journei tell you
anyth about them
you know them well enough macumazahn thei have to do with the
overthrow of a royal hous that ha work me bitter wrong as to how
your journei can help me why thu you shall promis to me to ask
of thi queen whether zikali openerofroad shall triumph or be
overthrown in that on which he ha set hi heart
as you seem to know thi witch so well why do you not ask her
yourself zikali
to ask is on thing macumazahn to get an answer is anoth i have
ask in the watch of the night and the repli wa come hither and
perchanc i will tell you queen i said how can i come save in the
spirit who am an ancient and a crippl dwarf scarc abl to stand
upon my feet
then send a messeng wizard and be sure that he is white for of
black savag i have seen more than enough let him bear a token also
that he come from you and tell me of it in your sleep moreov let
that token be someth of power which will protect him on the journei
such is the answer that come to me in my dream macumazahn
well what token will you give me zikali
he grope about in hi robe and produc a piec of ivori of the size
of a larg chessman that had a hole in it through which ran a plait
cord of the stiff hair from an eleph tail on thi articl which
wa of a rusti brown colour he breath then have whisper to it
for a while hand it to me
i took the talisman for such i guess it to be idli enough held it
to the light to examin it and start back so violent that almost
i let it fall i do not quit know why i start but i think it wa
becaus some influenc seem to leap from it to me zikali start also
and cri out
have a care macumazahn am i young that i can bear bring dash to the
ground
what do you mean i ask still stare at the thing which i
perceiv to be a most wonderfulli fashion like of the old dwarf
himself as he appear befor me crouch upon the ground there were
the deepset ey the great head the toadlik shape the long hair
all
it is a clever carv is it not macumazahn i am skill in that
art you know and therefor can judg of carv
ye i know i answer bethink me of anoth statuett of hi
which he had given to me on the morrow of the death of her from whom it
wa model but what of the thing
macumazahn it ha come down to me through the ag as you mai
have heard all great doctor when thei die pass on their wisdom and
someth of their knowledg to anoth doctor of spirit who is still
live on the earth that noth mai be lost or as littl as possibl
also i have learn that to such like as these mai be given the
strength of him or her from whom thei were shape
now i bethought me of the old egyptian and their ka statu of which
i had read and that these statu magic charm and set in the
tomb of the depart were suppos to be inhabit everlastingli by
the doubl of the dead endu with more power even than ever these
possess in life but of thi i said noth to zikali think that
it would take too much explan though i wonder veri much how he
had come by the same idea
when that ivori is hung over your heart macumazahn where you must
alwai wear it learn that with it goe the strength of zikali the
thought that would have been hi thought and the wisdom that is hi
wisdom will be your companion as much as though he walk at your
side and could instruct you in everi peril moreov north and south and
east and west thi imag is known to men who when thei see it will
bow down and obei open a road to him who wear the medicin of the
openerofroad
inde i said smile and what is thi colour on the ivori
i forget macumazahn who have had it a great number of year ever
sinc it descend to me from a forefath of mine who wa fashion in
the same mould as i am it look like blood doe it not it is a piti
that mameena is not still aliv sinc she whose memori wa so excel
might have been abl to tell you and as he spoke with a motion that
wa at onc sure and swift he threw the loop of eleph hair over my
head
hastili i chang the subject feel that after hi wont thi old
wizard the most terribl man whom ever i knew who had been so much
concern with the tragic death of mameena wa stab at me in some
hidden fashion
you tell me to go on thi journei i said and not alon yet for
companion you give me onli an ugli piec of ivori shape as no man ever
wa here i got on back at zikali and from the look of it steep
in blood which ivori if i had my wai i would throw into the camp
fire who then am i to take with me
dont do that macumazahni mean throw the ivori into the firesinc
i have no wish to burn befor my time and if you do you who have worn
it might burn with me at least certainli you would die with the magic
thing and go to acquir knowledg more quickli than you desir no no
and do not try to take it off your neck or rather try if you will
i did try but someth seem to prevent me from accomplish my
purpos of give the carv back to zikali as i wish to do first
my pipe got in the wai of my hand then the eleph hair caught in the
collar of my coat then a pang of rheumat to which i wa accustom
from an old lionbit develop of a sudden in my arm and lastli i
grew tire of bother about the thing
zikali who had been watch my movement burst out into on of hi
terribl laugh that seem to fill the whole kloof and to reecho from
it rocki wall it di awai and he went on without further refer
to the talisman or imag
you ask whom you were to take with you macumazahn well as to thi
i must make inquiri of those who know man my medicin
from the shadow in the hut behind dart out a tall figur carri

tonight macumazahn bring them i think ohoho
i turn to depart but when i had gone a littl wai zikali call me
back again and said speak veri low
when you meet thi umslopogaa as you will meet him he who is call
the woodpeck and the slaughter sai these word to him
a bat ha been twitter round the hut of the openerofroad and
to hi ear it squeak the name of a certain lousta and the name of a
woman call monazi also it twitter anoth greater name that mai not
be utter that of an eleph who shake the earth and said that thi
eleph sniff the air with hi trunk and grow angri and sharpen hi
tusk to dig a certain woodpeck out of hi hole in a tree that grow
near the witch mountain sai too that the openerofroad think that
thi woodpeck would be wise to fly north for a while in the compani of
on who watch by night lest harm should come to a bird that peck at
the feet of the great and chatter of it in hi nest
then zikali wave hi hand and i went wonder into what plot i had
stumbl
chapter ii
the messeng
i did not rest as i should that night who somehow wa never abl to
sleep well in the neighbourhood of the black kloof i suppos that
zikali constant talk about ghost with hi hint and innuendo
concern those who were dead alwai affect my nerv till in a
subconsci wai i began to believ that such thing exist and were
hang about me mani peopl ar open to the power of suggest and i
am afraid that i am on of them
howev the sun which ha such strength to kill noxiou thing put an
end to ghost more quickli even than it doe to other evil vapour and
eman and when i woke up to find it shine brilliantli in a pure
heaven i laugh with much hearti over the whole affair
go to the spring near which we were outspan i took off my
shirt to have a good wash still chuckl at the memori of all the
hocuspocu of my old friend the openerofroad
while engag in thi matutin oper i struck my hand against
someth and look observ that it wa the hideou littl ivori
imag of zikali which he had set about my neck the sight of the
thing and the memori of hi ridicul talk about it especi of it
assert that it had come down to him through the ag which it could
not have done see that it wa a like of himself irrit me so
much that i proceed to take it off with the full intent of throw
it into the spring
as i wa in the act of do thi from a clump of reed mix with
bush quit close to me there came a sound of hiss and suddenli
abov them appear the head of a great black immamba perhap the
deadliest of all our african snake and the onli on i know which will
attack man without provoc
leav go of the imag i sprang back in a great hurri toward where my
gun lai then the snake vanish and make sure that it had depart to
it hole which wa probabl at a distanc i return to the pool and
onc more began to take off the talisman in order to consign it to the
bottom of the pool
after all i reflect it wa a hideou and probabl a bloodstain
thing which i did not in the least wish to wear about my neck like a
ladi lovetoken
just as it wa come over my head suddenli from the other side of
the bush that infern snake pop up again thi time it wa
clear realli intent on busi it began to move toward me in the
lightninglik wai immamba have hiss and flick it tongu
i wa too quick for my friend howev for snatch up the gun that i
had lain down besid me i let it have a charg of buckshot in the
neck which nearli cut it in two so that it fell down and expir with
hideou convuls writh
hear the shot han came run from the waggon to see what wa the
matter han i should sai wa that same hottentot who had been the
companion of most of my journei sinc my father dai he wa with
me when as a young fellow i accompani retief to dingaan kraal
and like myself escap the massacr also we share mani other
adventur includ the great on in the land of the ivori child where
he slew the huge elephantgod jana and himself wa slain but of thi
journei we did not dream in those dai
see the book call marieeditor
for the rest han wa a most entir unprincipl person but as the
boer sai as clever as a waggonload of monkei also he drank when he
got the chanc on good qualiti he had howev no man wa ever more
faith and perhap it would be true to sai that neither man nor woman
ever love me unworthi quit so well
in appear he rather resembl an antiqu and dilapid baboon
hi face wa wrinkl like a dri nut and hi quick littl ey were
bloodshot i never knew what hi ag wa ani more than he did himself
but the year had left him tough as whipcord and absolut untir
lastli he wa perhap the best hand at follow a spoor that ever i
knew and up to a hundr and fifti yard or so a veri deadli shot
with a rifl especi when he us a littl singlebarrel
muzzleload gun of mine made by purdei which he name intombi or
maiden of that gun howev i have written in the holi flower and
elsewher
what is it baa he ask here there ar no lion nor ani game
look the other side of the bush han
he slip round it make a wide circl with hi usual caution then
see the snake which wa by the wai i think the biggest immamba
i ever kill suddenli froze as it were in a stiff attitud that
remind me of a pointer when it scent game have made sure that it
wa dead he nod and said
black mamba or so you would call it though i know it for someth
els
what els han
on of the old witchdoctor zikali spirit which he set at the mouth
of thi kloof to warn him of who come or goe i know it well and so
do other i saw it listen behind a stone when you were up the kloof
last even talk with the openerofroad
then zikali will lack a spirit i answer laugh which perhap
he will not miss amongst so mani it serv him right for set the
brute on me
quit so baa he will be angri i wonder why he did it he ad
suspici see that he is such a friend of your
he didnt do it han these snake ar veri fierc and give battl
that is all
han paid no attent to my remark which probabl he thought onli
worthi of a white man who doe not understand but roll hi yellow
bloodshot ey about as though in search of explan present
thei fell upon the ivori that hung about my neck and he start
why do you wear that pretti like of the great on yonder over your
heart as i have known you do with thing that belong to women in
past dai baa do you know that it is zikali great medicin noth
less as everyon doe throughout the land when zikali send an order
far awai he alwai send that imag with it for then he who receiv
the order know that he must obei or die also the messeng know that
he will come to no harm if he doe not take it off becaus baa the
imag is zikali himself and zikali is the imag thei ar on and the
same also it is the imag of hi father father fatheror so he
sai
that is an odd stori i said
then i told han as much as i thought advis of how thi horrid
littl talisman came into my possess
han nod without show ani surpris
so we ar go on a long journei he said well i thought it wa
time that we did someth more than wander about these tame countri
sell blanket to stink old women and so forth baa moreov
zikali doe not wish that you should come to harm doubtless becaus he
doe wish to make us of you afterwardsoh it safe to talk now when
that spirit is awai look for anoth snake what were you do with
the great medicin baa when the mamba attack you
take it off to throw it into the pool han as i do not like the
thing i tri twice and each time the immamba appear
of cours it appear baa and what is more if you had taken that
medicin off and thrown it awai you would have disappear sinc the
mamba would have kill you zikali want to show you that baa
and that is why he set the snake at you
you ar a superstiti old fool han
ye baa but my father knew all about that great medicin befor me
for he wa a bit of a doctor and so doe everi wizard and witch for a
thousand mile or more i tell you baa it is known by all though no
on ever talk about it no not even the king himself baa speak
to you not with the voic of han the old drunkard but with that of
the predik your reverend father who made so good a christian of
me and who tell me to do so from up in heaven where the hot fire ar
which the wood feed of itself i beg you not to try to throw awai the
medicin again or if you wish to do so to leav me behind on thi
journei for you see baa although i am now so good almost like on
of those angel with the pretti goos wing in the pictur i feel
that i should like to grow a littl better befor i go to the place of
fire to make report to your reverend father the predik
think of how horrifi my dear father would be if he could hear all
thi string of ridicul nonsens and learn the result of hi moral and
religi lesson on raw hottentot materi i burst out laugh but
han went on as grave as a judg
wear the great medicin baa wear it part with the liver insid you
befor you part with that baa it mai not be as pretti or smell as
sweet as a woman hair in a littl gold bottl but it is much more
us the sight of the woman hair will onli make you sick in your
stomach and caus you to rememb a lot of thing which you had much
better forget but the great medicin or rather zikali who is in it
will keep the assegai and sick out of you and turn back bad magic
on to the head of those who sent it and alwai bring us plenti to eat
and perhap if we ar lucki a littl to drink too sometim
go awai i said i want to wash
ye baa but with the baass leav i will sit on the other side of
that bush with the gunnot to look at the baa without hi cloth
becaus white peopl ar alwai so ugli that it make me feel ill to see
them undress also becauseth baa will forgiv mebut becaus thei
smell no not for that but just to see that no other snake come
get out of the road you dirti littl scoundrel and stop your
impud i said lift my foot suggest
thereon he scoot with a subdu grin round the other side of the bush
whenc as i knew well he kept hi ey fix on me to be sure that i made
no further attempt to take off the great medicin
now of thi talisman i mai as well sai at onc that i am no believ
in it or it preciou influenc therefor although it wa us
sometim notabl twice when umslopogaa wa concern i do not know
whether person i should have done better or wors upon that journei
if i had thrown it into the pool
it is true howev that until quit the end of thi histori when
it becam need to do so to save anoth i never made ani further
attempt to remov it from my neck not even when it rub a sore in my
skin becaus i did not wish to offend the prejudic of han
it is true moreov that thi hideou ivori had a reput which
stretch veri far from the place where it wa made and wa regard
with great rever by all kind of queer peopl even by the amahagg
themselv of whom present as thei sai in pedigre a fact of which
i found sundri proof inde i saw a first exampl of it when a littl
while later i met that great warrior umslopogaa chief of the peopl
of the ax
for after determin firmli for reason which i will set out that
i would not visit thi man in the end i did so although by then i
had given up ani idea of journei across the zambesi to look for a
mysteri and nonexist witchwoman as zikali had suggest that i
should do to begin with i knew that hi talk wa all rubbish and
even if it were not that at the bottom of it wa some desir of the
openerofroad that i should make a path for him to travel toward an
indefinit but doubtless evil object of hi own further by thi time
i had worn through that mood of mine which had caus me to yearn
for correspond with the depart and a certain knowledg of their
exist
i wonder whether mani peopl understand as i do how entir distinct
and how variabl ar these mood which swai us or at ani rate some of
us at sundri period of our live as i think i have alreadi suggest
at on time we ar all spiritu at anoth all physic at on time
we ar sure that our live here ar as a dream and a shadow and that the
real exist li elsewher at anoth that these brief dai of our
ar the onli busi with which we have to do and that of it we must
make the best at on time we think our love much more immort than
the star at anoth that thei ar mere shadow cast by the bale sun
of desir upon the shallow and fleet water we call life which seem
to flow out of nowher into nowher at on time we ar full of
faith at anoth all such hope ar blot out by a black wall of
nothing and so on ad infinitum onli veri stupid peopl or
humbug ar or pretend to be alwai consist and unchang
to return i determin not onli that i would not travel north to seek
that which no live man will ever find certainti as to the futur
but also to show my independ of zikali that i would not visit
thi chief umslopogaa so have trade all my good and made a fair
profit on paper i set myself to return to natal propos to rest
awhil in my littl hous at durban and told han my mind
veri good baa he said i too should like to go to durban there
ar lot of thing there that we cannot get here and he fix hi
rove ey upon a squarefac gin bottl which as it happen wa
fill with noth stronger than water becaus all the gin wa drunk
yet baa we shall not see the berea for a long while
why do you sai that i ask sharpli
oh baa i dont know but you went to visit the openerofroad
did you not and he told you to go north and lent you a certain great
medicin did he not
here hand proceed to light hi corncob pipe with an ash from the
fire all the time keep hi beadi ey fix upon that part of me
where he knew the talisman wa hung
quit true han but now i mean to show zikali that i am not hi
messeng for south or north or east or west so tomorrow morn we
cross the river and trek for natal
ye baa but then why not cross it thi even there is still
light
i have said that we will cross it tomorrow morn i answer with
that firm which i have read alwai indic a man of charact
and i do not chang my word
no baa but sometim other thing chang besid word will the
baa have that buck leg for supper or the stuff out of a tin with a
dint in it which we bought at a store two year ago the fli have got
at the buck leg but i cut out the bit with the maggot on it and at
them myself
han wa right thing do chang especi the weather that night
unexpectedli for when i turn in the sky seem quit seren there
came a terribl rain long befor it wa due which last off and on for
three whole dai and continu intermitt for an indefinit period
needless to sai the river which it would have been so easi to cross
on thi particular even by the morn wa a rage torrent and so
remain for sever week
in despair at length i trek south to where a ford wa report
which when reach prove impractic
i tri anoth a dozen mile further on which wa veri hard to come
to over boggi land it look all right and we were get across
fine when suddenli on of the wheel sank in an unsuspect hole and
there we stuck inde i believ the waggon or bit of it would
have remain in the neighbourhood of that ford to thi dai had i not
manag to borrow some extra oxen belong to a christian kaffir and
with their help to drag it back to the bank whenc we had start
as it happen i wa onli just in time sinc a new storm which had
burst further up the river brought it down in flood again a veri heavi
flood
in thi countri england where i write there ar bridg everywher
and no on seem to appreci them if thei think of them at all it
is to grumbl about the cost of their upkeep i wish thei could have
experienc what a lack of them mean in a wild countri dure time of
excess rain and the same remark appli to road you should
think more of your bless my friend as the old woman said to her
complain daughter who had twin two year run ad that thei
might have been triplet
to returnaft thi i confess myself beaten and gave up until such
time as it should pleas provid to turn off the watertap trek
out of sight of that infern river which annoi me with it constant
gurgl i camp on a compar dry spot that overlook a
beauti stretch of roll veld toward sunset the cloud lift
and i saw a mile or two awai a most extraordinari mountain on the lower
slope of which grew a dens forest it upper part which wa of bare
rock look exactli like the seat figur of a grotesqu person with
the chin rest on the breast there wa the head there were the arm
there were the knee inde the whole mass of it remind me strongli
of the effigi of zikali which wa ti about my neck or rather of
zikali himself
what is that call i said to han point to thi strang hill
now blaze in the angri fire of the set sun that had burst out
between the storm cloud which made it appear more omin even than
befor
that is the witch mountain baa where the chief umslopogaa and a
blood brother of hi who carri a great club us to hunt with the
wolv it is haunt and in a cave at the top of it lie the bone of
nada the lili the fair woman whose name is a song she who wa the love
of umslopogaa
for the stori of umslopogaa and nada see the book
call nada the lilyeditor
rubbish i said though i had heard someth of all that stori and
rememb that zikali had mention thi nada compar her beauti to
that of anoth whom onc i knew
where then live the chief umslopogaa
thei sai that hi town is yonder on the plain baa it is call the
place of the ax and is strongli fortifi with a river round most of
it and hi peopl ar the peopl of the ax thei ar a fierc peopl
and all the countri round here is uninhabit becaus umslopogaa ha
clean out the tribe who us to live in it first with hi wolv
and afterward in war he is so strong a chief and so terribl in battl
that even chaka himself wa afraid of him and thei sai that he brought
dingaan the king to hi end becaus of a quarrel about thi nada
cetywayo the present king too leav him alon and to him he pai no
tribut
whilst i wa about to ask han from whom he had collect all thi
inform suddenli i heard sound and look up saw three tall men
clad in full herald dress rush toward us at great speed
here come some chip from the ax said han and promptli bolt into
the waggon
i did not bolt becaus there wa no time to do so without loss of
digniti but although i wish i had my rifl with me just sat still
upon my stool and with great deliber light my pipe take not
the slightest notic of the three savagelook fellow
these who i note carri ax instead of assegai rush straight at
me with the ax rais in such a fashion that anyon unacquaint with
the habit of zulu warrior of the old school might have thought that
thei intend noth short of murder
as i expect howev within about six feet of me thei halt suddenli
and stood there still as statu for my part i went on light my pipe
as though i did not see them and when at length i wa oblig to lift my
head survei them with an air of mild interest
then i took a littl book out of my pocket it wa my favourit copi of
the ingoldsbi legendsand began to read
the passag which caught my ey if ax be substitut for knife wa
not inappropri it wa from the nurs stori and run
but oh what a thing ti to see and to know
that the bare knife is rais in the hand of the foe
without hope to repel or to ward off the blow
thi proceed of mine astonish them a good deal who felt that thei
had so to speak miss fire at last the soldier in the middl said
ar you blind white man
no black fellow i answer but i am shortsight would you be so
good as to stand out of my light a remark which puzzl them so much
that all three drew back a few pace
when i had read a littl further i came to the follow line
ti plain
as anatomist tell us that never again
shall life revisit the foulli slain
when onc theyv been cut through the jugular vein
in my circumst at that moment thi statement seem altogeth too
suggest so i shut up the book and remark
if you ar wander who want food as i judg by your be so thin
i am sorri that i have littl meat but my servant will give you what
thei can
ow said the spokesman he call us wander either he must be a
veri great man or he is mad
you ar right i am a great man i answer yawn and if you
troubl me too much you will see that i can be mad also now what do you
want
we ar messeng from the great chief umslopogaa captain of the
peopl of the ax and we want tribut answer the man in a somewhat
chang tone
do you then you wont get it i thought that onli the king of zululand
had a right to tribut and your captain name is not cetywayo is it
our captain is king here said the man still more uncertainli
is he inde then awai with you back to him and tell thi king of whom
i have never heard though i have a messag for a certain umslopogaa
that macumazahn watcherbynight intend to visit him tomorrow if
he will send a guid at the first light to show the best path for the
waggon
hearken said the man to hi companion thi is macumazahn himself
and no other well we thought it for who els would have dare
then thei salut with their ax call me chief and other fine
name and depart as thei had come at a run call out that my
messag should be deliv and that doubtless umslopogaa would send
the guid
so it came about that quit contrari to my intent after all
circumst brought me to the town of the ax even to the last moment
i had not meant to go there but when the tribut wa demand i saw
that it wa best to do so and have onc pass my word it could
not be alter inde i felt sure that in thi event there would be
troubl and that my oxen would be stolen or wors
so fate have issu it decre of which hanss version wa that
zikali or hi great medicin had so arrang thing i shrug my
shoulder and wait
chapter iii
umslopogaa of the ax
next morn at the dawn guid arriv from the town of the ax
bring with them a yoke of spare oxen which show that it chief wa
realli anxiou to see me so in due cours we inspan and start
the guid lead us by a rough but practic road down the steep
hillsid to the saucerlik plain beneath where i saw mani cattl
graze travel some mile across thi plain we came at last to a
river of no great breadth that encircl a consider kaffir town
on three side the fourth be protect by a littl line of koppi
which were join togeth with wall also the place wa strongli
fortifi with fenc and in everi other wai known to the nativ mind
with the help of the spare oxen we cross the river safe at the ford
although it wa veri full and on the further side were receiv by a
guard of men tall soldierlik fellow all of them arm with ax as
the messeng had been thei led us up to the cattl enclosur in the
centr of the town which although it could be us to protect beast in
case of emerg also serv the practic purpos of a public squar
here some ceremoni wa in progress for soldier stood round the kraal
while herald pranc and shout at the head of the place in front
of the chief big hut wa a littl group of peopl among whom a big
gaunt man sat upon a stool clad in a warrior dress with a great and
veri long ax haft with wirelash rhinocero horn laid across hi
knee
our guid led me with han sneak after me like a deject and
lowbr dog for the waggon had stop outsid the gate across the
kraal to where the herald shout and the big man sat yawn at onc
i note that he wa a veri remark person broad and tall and spare
of frame with long toughlook arm and a fierc face which remind
me of that of the late king dingaan also he had a great hole in hi
head abov the templ where the skull had been driven in by some blow
and keen royallook ey
he look up and see me cri out
what ha a white man come to fight me for the chieftainship of the
peopl of the ax well he is a small on
no i answer quietli but macumazahn watcherbynight ha come
to visit you in answer to your request o umslopogaa macumazahn whose
name wa known in thi land befor your wa told of o umslopogaa
the chief heard and rise from hi seat lift the big ax in salut
i greet you o macumazahn he said who although you ar small
in statur ar veri great inde in fame have i not heard how you
conquer bangu although saduko slew him and of how you gave up the
six hundr head of cattl to tshoza and the men of the amangwan who
fought with you the cattl that were your own have i not heard how you
led the tulwana against the usutu and stamp flat three of cetywayo
regiment in the dai of panda although ala becaus of an oath of
mine i lift no steel in that battl i who will have noth to do
with those that spring from the blood of senzangaconaperhap becaus
i smell too strongli of it macumazahn oh ye i have heard these and
mani other thing concern you though until now it ha never been
my fortun to look upon your face o watcherbynight and therefor i
greet you well bold on cun on upright on friend of us black
peopl
thank you i answer but you said someth about fight if
there is to be anyth of the sort let us get it over if you want to
fight i am quit readi and i tap the rifl which i carri
the grim chief broke into a laugh and said
listen by an ancient law ani man on thi dai in each year mai fight me
for thi chieftainship as i fought and conquer him who held it befor
me and take it from me with my life and the ax though of late none
seem to like the busi but that law wa made befor there were
gun or men like macumazahn who it is said can hit a lizard on a wall
at fifti pace therefor i tell you that if you wish to fight me with a
rifl o macumazahn i give in and you mai have the chieftainship and
he laugh again in hi fierc fashion
i think it is too hot for fight either with gun or ax and
chieftainship ar honei that is full of sting bee i answer
then i took my seat on a stool that had been brought for me and place
by the side of umslopogaa after which the ceremoni went on
the herald cri out the challeng to all and sundri to come and fight
the holder of the ax for the chieftainship of the ax without the
slightest result sinc nobodi seem to desir to do anyth of the
sort then after a paus umslopogaa rose swing hi formid
weapon round hi head and declar that by right of conquest he wa
chief of the tribe for the ensu year an announc that everybodi
accept without surpris
again the herald summon all and sundri who had grievanc to come
forward and to state them and receiv redress
after a littl paus there appear a veri handsom woman with larg
ey particularli brilliant ey that roll as though thei were in
search of someon she wa fine dress and i saw by the ornament she
wore that she held the rank of a chief wife
i monazi have a complaint to make she said as it is the right
of the humblest to do on thi dai in success to zinita whom dingaan
slew with her children i am your inkosikaa your headwif o
umslopogaa
that i know well enough said umslopogaa what of it
thi that you neglect me for other women as you neglect zinita
for nada the beauti nada the witch i am childless as ar all your
wive becaus of the curs that thi nada left behind her i demand that
thi curs should be lift from me for your sake i abandon lousta
the chief to whom i wa betroth and thi is the end of it that i am
neglect and childless
am i the heaven abov that i can caus you to bear children woman
ask umslopogaa angrili would that you had clung to lousta my
bloodbroth and my friend whom you lament and left me alon
that still mai chanc if i am not better treat answer monazi
with a flash of her ey will you dismiss yonder new wife of your and
give me back my place and will you lift the curs of nada off me or
will you not
as to the first answer umslopogaa learn monazi that i will not
dismiss my new wife who at least is gentlertongu and truerheart
than you ar as to the second you ask that which it is not in my power
to give sinc children ar the gift of heaven and barren is it
bane moreov you have done ill to bring into thi matter the name of
on who is dead who of all women wa the sweetest and most innoc
lastli i warn you befor the peopl to ceas from your plot or
traffic with lousta lest ill come of them to you or him even though
he be my bloodbroth or to both
plot cri monazi in a shrill and furiou voic doe
umslopogaa talk of plot well i have heard that chaka the lion
left a son and that thi son ha set a trap for the feet of him who
sit on chaka throne perchanc that king ha heard it also perchanc
the peopl of the ax will soon have anoth chief
is it thu said umslopogaa quietli and if so will he be name
lousta
then hi smoulder wrath broke out and in a kind of roar voic he
went on
what have i done that the wive of my bosom should be my betray
those who would give me to death zinita betrai me to dingaan and
in reward wa slain and my children with her now would you monazi
betrai me to cetywayothough in truth there is naught to betrai well
if so bethink you and let lousta bethink him of what chanc to zinita
and of what chanc to those who stand befor the ax of umslopogaa
what have i done i sai that women should thu strive to work me ill
thi answer monazi with a mock laugh that you have love on
of them too well if he would live in peac he who ha wive should
favour all alik least of anyth should he moan continu over on
who is dead a witch who ha left a curs behind her and thu insult
and do wrong to the live also he would be wise to attend to the
matter of hi own tribe and household and to ceas from ambit that
mai bring him to the assegai and them with him
i have heard your counsel wife so now begon said umslopogaa
look at her veri strang and it seem to me not without fear
have you wive macumazahn he ask of me in a low voic when she wa
out of hear
onli among the spirit i answer
well for you then moreov it is a bond between us for i too have
but on true wife and she also is among the spirit but go rest a
while and later we will talk
so i went leav the chief to hi busi think as i walk awai
of a certain messag with which i wa charg for him and of how into
that messag came name that i had just heard name that of a man
call lousta and of a woman call monazi also i thought of the hint
which in her jealou anger and disappoint at her lack of children
thi woman had drop about a plot against him who sat on the throne of
chaka which of cours must mean king cetywayo himself
i came to the guesthut which prove to be a veri good place and clean
also in it i found plenti of food made readi for me and for my servant
after eat i slept for a time as it is alwai my fashion to do when i
have noth els on hand sinc who know for how long he mai be kept
awak at night inde it wa not until the sun had begun to sink
that a messeng came sai that the chief desir to see me if i had
rest so i went to hi big hut which stood alon with a strong fenc
set round it at a distanc so that none could come within hear of
what wa said even at the door of the hut i observ also that a man
arm with an ax kept guard at the gatewai in thi fenc round which he
walk from time to time
the chief umslopogaa wa seat on a stool by the door of hi hut with
hi rhinoceroshornhandl ax which wa fasten to hi right wrist
by a thong lean against hi thigh and a wolfskin hang from hi
broad shoulder veri grim and fierc he look thu with the red light
of the sunset plai on him he greet me and point to anoth stool
on which i sat myself down appar he had been watch my ey for
he said
i see that like other creatur which move at night such as leopard
and hyena you take note of all o watcherbynight even of the
soldier who guard thi place and of where the fenc is set and of how
it gate is fashion
had i not done so i should have been dead long ago o chief
ye and becaus it is not my natur to do so as i should perchanc
i shall soon be dead it is not enough to be fierc and foremost in the
battl macumazahn he who would sleep safe and of whom when he di
folk will sai he ha eaten ie he ha live out hi life must do
more than thi he must guard hi tongu and even hi thought he must
listen to the stir of rat in the thatch and look for snake in
the grass he must trust few and least of all those who sleep upon hi
bosom but those who have the lion blood in them or who ar prone to
charg like a buffalo often neglect these matter and therefor in the
end thei fall into a pit
ye i answer especi those who have the lion blood in them
whether that lion be man or beast
thi i said becaus of the rumour i had heard that thi slaughter wa
in truth the son of chaka therefor not know whether or no he were
plai on the word lion which wa chaka titl i wish to draw
him especi as i saw in hi face a great like to chaka brother
dingaan whom it wa whisper thi same umslopogaa had slain as it
happen i fail for after a paus he said
why do you come to visit me macumazahn who have never done so
befor
i do not come to visit you umslopogaa that wa not my intent you
brought me or rather the flood river and you togeth brought me
for i wa on my wai to natal and could not cross the drift
yet i think you have a messag for me white man for not long ago a
certain wander witchdoctor who came here told me to expect you and
that you had word to sai to me
did he umslopogaa well it is true that i have a messag though it
is on that i did not mean to deliv
yet be here perchanc you will deliv it macumazahn for those
who have messag and will not speak them sometim come to troubl
ye be here i will deliv it see that so it seem to be
fate tell me do you chanc to know a certain small on who is
great a certain old on whose brain is young a doctor who is call
openerofroad
i have heard of him as have my forefath for gener
inde and if it pleas you to tell me umslopogaa what might be
the name of those forefath of your who have heard of thi doctor
for gener thei must have been shortliv men and as such i
should like to know of them
that you cannot repli umslopogaa shortli sinc thei ar
hlonipa ie not to be spoken in thi land
inde i said again i thought that rule appli onli to the name
of king but of cours i am but an ignor white man who mai well be
mistaken on such matter of your zulu custom
ye o macumazahn you mai be mistaken oryou mai not it matter
noth but what of thi messag of your
it came at the end of a long stori o bulalio but sinc you seek to
know these were the word of it so nearli as i can rememb them
then sentenc by sentenc i repeat to him all that zikali had said to
me when he call me back after bid me farewel which doubtless he
did becaus he wish to cut hi messag more deepli into the tablet of
my mind
umslopogaa listen to everi syllabl with a curiou intent and
then ask me to repeat it all again which i did
lousta monazi he said slowli well you heard those name todai
did you not white man and you heard certain thing from the lip
of thi monazi who wa angri that give colour to that talk of the
openerofroad it seem to me he ad glanc about him and
speak in a low voic that what i suspect is true and that without
doubt i am betrai
i do not understand i repli indiffer all thi talk is dark
to me as is the messag of the openerofroad or rather it mean
by whom and about what ar you betrai
let that snake sleep do not kick it with your foot suffic it you to
know that my head hang upon thi matter that i am a rat in a fork
stick and if the stick is press on by a heavi hand then where is the
rat
where all rat go i suppos that is unless thei ar wise rat that
bite the hand which hold the stick befor it is press down
what is the rest of thi stori of your macumazahn which wa told
befor the openerofroad gave you that messag doe it pleas you to
repeat it to me that i mai judg of it with my ear
certainli i answer on on condit that what the ear hear the
heart shall keep to itself alon
umslopogaa stoop and laid hi hand upon the broad blade of the weapon
besid him sai
by the ax i swear it if i break the oath be the ax my doom
then i told him the tale as i have set it down alreadi think
to myself that of it he would understand littl be but a wild
warriorman as it chanc howev i wa mistaken for he seem to
understand a great deal perchanc becaus such primit natur ar in
closer touch with high and secret thing than we imagin perchanc for
other reason with which i becam acquaint later
it stand thu he said when i had finish or so i think you
macumazahn seek certain women who ar dead to learn whether thei still
live or ar realli dead but so far have fail to find them still
seek you ask the counsel of zikali openerofroad he who among
other titl is also call home of spirit he answer that he could
not satisfi your heart becaus thi tree wa too tall for him to climb
but that far to the north there live a certain white witch who ha
power greater than hi be abl to fly to the top of ani tree and
to thi white witch he bade you go have i the stori right thu far
i answer that he had
good then zikali went on to choos you companion for your journei
but two leav out the guard or servant i umhlopekazi call
bulalio the slaughter call the woodpeck also wa on of these
and that littl yellow monkei of a man whom i saw with you todai
call hansi wa the other then you made a mock of zikali by
determin not to visit me umhlopekazi and not to go north to find
the great white queen of whom he had told you but to return to natal
is that so
i said it wa
then the rain fell and the wind blew and the river rose in wrath so
that you could not return to natal and after all by chanc or by fate
or by the will of zikali the wizard of wizard you drift here to the
kraal of me umhlopekazi and told me thi stori
just so i answer
well white man how am i to know that all thi is not but a trap for
my feet which alreadi seem to feel cord between the toe of both of
them what token do you bring o watcherbynight how am i to know that
the openerofroad realli sent me thi messag which ha been deliv
so strang by on who wish to travel on anoth path the wander
witchdoctor told me that he who came would bear some sign
i cant sai i answer at least in word but i ad after
reflect as you ask for a token perhap i might be abl to show you
someth that would bring proof to your heart if there were ani secret
place
umslopogaa walk to the gatewai of the fenc and saw that the sentri
wa at hi post then he walk round the hut cast an ey upon it
roof and mutter to me as he return
onc i wa caught thu there live a certain wife of mine who set her
ear to the smokehol and so brought about the death of mani and among
them of herself and of our children enter all is safe yet if you
talk speak low
so we went into the hut take the stool with us and seat ourselv
by the fire that burn there on to which umslopogaa threw chip of
resin wood
now he said
i open my shirt and by the clear light of the flame show him the
imag of zikali which hung about my neck he stare at it though touch
it he would not then he stood up and lift hi great ax he salut
the imag with the word makosi the salut that is given to great
wizard becaus thei ar suppos to be the home of mani spirit
it is the big medicin the medicin itself he said that which ha
been known in the land sinc the time of senzangacona the father of the
zulu royal hous and as it is said befor him
how can that be i ask see that thi imag repres zikali
openerofroad as an old man and senzangacona di mani year ago
i do not know he answer but it is so listen there wa a certain
mopo or as some call him umbopo who wa chaka bodyserv and my
fosterfath and he told me that twice thi medicin and he point
to the imag wa sent to chaka and that each time the lion obei the
messag that came with it a third time it wa sent but he did not obei
the messag and thenwher wa chaka
here umslopogaa pass hi hand across hi mouth a signific gestur
amongst the zulu
mopo i said ye i have heard the stori of mopo also that chaka
bodi becam hi servant in the end sinc mopo kill him with the
help of the princ dingaan and umhlangana also i have heard that thi
mopo still live though not in zululand
doe he macumazahn said umslopogaa take snuff from a spoon and
look at me keenli over the spoon you seem to know a great deal
macumazahn too much as some might think
ye i answer perhap i do know too much or at ani rate more than
i want to know for instanc o fosterl of mopo and son ofwa the
ladi name balekai know a good deal about you
umslopogaa stare at me and lai hi hand upon the great ax half
rose then he sat down again
i think that thi and i touch the imag of zikali upon my breast
would turn even the blade of the ax name groanmak i said and
paus as noth happen i went on for instanc again i think i
knowor have i dream itthat a certain chief whose mother name
i believ wa balekabi the wai wa she not on of chaka
sistersha been plot against that son of panda who sit upon
the throne and that hi plot have been betrai so that he is in some
danger of hi life
macumazahn said umslopogaa hoars i tell you that did you not
wear the great medicin on your breast i would kill you where you sit
and buri you beneath the floor of the hut as on who knowstoo much
it would be a mistak umslopogaa on of the mani that you have made
but as i do wear the medicin the question doe not aris doe it
again he made no answer and i went on and now what about thi journei
to the north if inde i must make it would you wish to accompani me
umslopogaa rose from the stool and crawl out of the hut appar
to make some inspect present he return and remark that the
night wa clear although there were heavi storm cloud on the horizon
by which i understood him to convei in zulu metaphor that it wa safe
for us to talk but that danger threaten from afar
macumazahn he said we speak under the blanket of the
openerofroad who sit upon your heart and whose sign you bring to
me as he sent me word that you would do we not
i suppos so i answer at ani rate we speak as man to man and
hitherto the honour of macumazahn ha not been doubt in zululand so
if you have anyth to sai chief bulalio sai it at onc for i am
tire and should like to eat and rest
good macumazahn i have thi to sai i who am the son of on who wa
greater than he have plot to seiz the throne of zululand from him
who sit upon that throne it is true for i grew weari of my idl
as a petti chief moreov i should have succeed with the help of
zikali who hate the hous of senzangacona though me who am of it
blood he doe not hate becaus ever i have striven against that hous
but it seem from hi messag and those word spoken by an angri woman
that i have been betrai and that tonight or tomorrow night or
by the next moon the slayer will be upon me smite me befor i can
smite at which i cannot grumbl
by whom have you been betrai umslopogaa
by that wife of mine as i think macumazahn also by lousta my
bloodbroth over whom she ha cast her net and made fals to me
so that he hope to win her whom he ha alwai love and with her the
chieftainship of the ax now what shall i dotel me you whose ey
can see in the dark
i thought a moment and answer i think that if i were you i would
leav thi lousta to sit in my place for a while as chief of the peopl
of the ax and take a journei north umslopogaa then if troubl come
from the great hous where a king sit it will come to lousta who can
show that the peopl of the ax ar innoc and that you ar far awai
that is cun macumazahn there speak the great medicin if i go
north who can sai that i have plot and if i leav my betray in my
place who can sai that i wa a traitor who have set him where i us
to sit and left the land upon a privat matter and now tell me of thi
journei of your
so i told him everyth although until that moment i had not made up
my mind to go upon thi journei i who had come here to hi kraal
by accid or so it seem and by accid had deliv to him a
certain messag
you wish to consult a white witchdoctoress macumazahn who accord
to zikali live far to the north as to the dead now i too though
perchanc you will not think it of a black man desir to learn of the
dead ye of a certain wife of my youth who wa sister and friend as
well as wife whom too i love better than all the world also i desir
to learn of a brother of mine whose name i never speak who rule the
wolv with me and who di at my side on yonder witchmountain have
made him a mat of men to lie on in a great and gloriou fight for of
him as of the woman i think all dai and dream all night and i would
know if thei still live anywher and i mai look to see them again when
i have di as a warrior should and as i hope to do do you understand
watcherbynight
i answer that i understood veri well as hi case seem to be like my
own
it mai happen went on umslopogaa that all thi talk of the dead
who ar suppos to live after thei ar dead is but as the sound of
wind whisper in the reed at night that come from nowher and goe
nowher and mean noth but at least our will be a great journei in
which we shall find adventur and fight sinc it is well known in
the land that wherev macumazahn goe there is plenti of both also it
seem well for reason that have been spoken of between us as zikali
sai that i should leav the countri of the zulu for a while who
desir to die a man death at the last and not to be trap like a
jackal in a pit lastli i think that we shall agre well togeth though
my temper is rough at time and that neither of us will desert the
other in troubl though of that littl yellow dog of your i am not so
sure
i answer for him i repli han is a true man cun also when
onc he is awai from drink
then we spoke of plan for our journei and of when and where we should
meet to make it talk till it wa late after which i went to sleep
in the guesthut
chapter iv
the lion and the ax
next dai earli i left the town of the peopl of the ax have bid a
formal farewel to umslopogaa sai in a voic that all could
hear that as the river were still flood i propos to trek to the
northern part of zululand and trade there until the weather wa better
our privat arrang howev wa that on the night of the next
full moon which happen about four week later we should meet at the
eastern foot of a certain great flattop mountain known to both of
us which stand to the north of zululand but well beyond it border
so northward i trek slowli to spare my oxen trade as i went the
detail do not matter but as it happen i met with more luck upon that
journei than had come my wai for mani a long year although i work
on credit sinc nearli all my good were sold as ow to my reput i
could alwai do in zululand i made some excel bargain in cattl
and to top up with bought a larg lot of ivori so cheap that realli i
think it must have been stolen
all of thi cattl and ivori togeth i sent to natal in charg of a
white friend of mine whom i could trust where the stuff wa sold
veri well inde and the proce paid to my account the trade
equival be duli remit to the nativ vendor
in fact my good fortun wa such that if i had been superstiti like
han i should have been inclin to attribut it to the influenc of
zikali great medicin as it wa i knew it to be on of the chanc
of a trader life and accept it with a shrug as often as i had been
accustom to do in the altern of loss
onli on untoward incid happen to me of a sudden a parti of
the king soldier under the command of a wellknown induna or
councillor arriv and insist upon search my waggon as i thought
at first in connect with that cheap lot of ivori which had alreadi
depart to natal howev never a word did thei sai of ivori nor
inde wa a singl thing belong to me taken by them
i wa veri indign and express my feel to the induna in no
measur term he on hi part wa most apologet and explain that
what he did he wa oblig to do by the king order also he let it
slip that he wa seek for a certain evildo who it wa thought
might be with me without my know hi real charact and as thi
evildo whose name he would not mention wa a veri fierc man it
had been necessari to bring a strong guard with him
now i bethought me of umslopogaa but mere look blank and shrug
my shoulder sai that i wa not in the habit of consort with
evildo
still unsatisfi the induna question me as to the place where
i had been dure thi journei of mine in the zulu countri i told him
with the utmost frank mention among othersbecaus i wa sure
that alreadi he knew all my movement wellth town of the peopl of
the ax
then he ask me if i had seen it chief a certain umslopogaa or
bulalio i answer ye that i had met him there for the first time
and thought him a veri remark man
with thi the induna agre emphat sai that perhap i did
not know how remark next he ask me where he wa now to which
i repli that i had not the faintest idea but i presum in hi kraal
where i had left him the induna explain that he wa not in hi
kraal that he had gone awai leav on lousta and hi own head wife
monazi to administ the chieftainship for a while becaus as he
state he wish to make a journei
i yawn as if weari of the subject of thi chief and inde of the
whole busi then the induna said that i must come to the king and
repeat to him all the word that i had spoken i repli that i could
not possibl do so as have finish my trade i had arrang to go
north to shoot eleph he answer that eleph live a long while
and would not die while i wa visit the king
then follow an argument which grew heat and end in hi declar
that to the king i must come even if he had to take me there by forc
i sat silent wonder what to sai or do and leant forward to pick a
piec of wood out of the fire wherewith to light my pipe now my shirt
wa not button and as it chanc thi action caus the ivori imag of
zikali that hung about my neck to appear between it edg the induna
saw it and hi ey grew big with fear
hide that he whisper hide that lest it should bewitch me
inde alreadi i feel as though i were be bewitch it is the great
medicin itself
that will certainli happen to you i said yawn again if you
insist upon my take a week trek to visit the black on or interfer
with me in ani wai now or afterward and i lift my hand toward the
talisman look him steadili in the face
perhap after all macumazahn it is not necessari for you to visit the
king he said in an uncertain voic i will go and make report to him
that you know noth of thi evildo
and he went in such a hurri that he never wait to sai goodby next
morn befor the dawn i went also and trek steadili until i wa
clear of zululand
in due cours and without accid for the weather which had been
so wet had now turn beautifulli fine and dry we came to the great
flattop hill that i have mention trek thither over high
sparselytimb veld that offer few difficulti to the waggon thi
peculiar hill known to such nativ as live in those part by a long
word that mean hutwithaflatroof is surround by forest for
here tree grow wonderfulli well perhap becaus of the water that
flow from it slope forc our wai through thi forest which wa
full of game i reach it eastern foot and there camp five
dai befor that night of full moon on which i had arrang to meet
umslopogaa
that i should meet him i did not in the least believ firstli becaus
i thought it veri probabl that he would have chang hi mind about
come and secondli for the excel reason that i expect he had
gone to call upon the king against hi will as i had been ask to do
it wa evid to me that he wa up to hi ey in some seriou plot
against cetywayo in which he wa the old dwarf zikali partner or
rather tool also that hi plot had been betrai with the result that
he wa want and would have littl chanc of pass safe through
zululand so take on thing with anoth i imagin that i had seen
hi grim face and hi peculiar ancientlook ax for the last time
to tell the truth i wa glad although at first the idea had appeal to
me a littl i did not want to make thi wildgoos or wildwitch chase
through unknown land to seek for a total fabul person who dwelt
far across the zambesi i had as it were been forc into the thing
but if umslopogaa did not appear my oblig would be at an end
and i should return to natal at my leisur first howev i would do
a littl shoot sinc i found that a larg herd of eleph haunt
thi forest inde i wa tempt to attack them at onc but did not
do so sinc as han point out if we were go north it would be
difficult to carri the ivori especi if we had to leav the waggon
and i wa too old a hunter to desir to kill the great beast for the
fun of the thing
so i just sat down and rest let the oxen feed throughout the
hour of light on the rich grass which grew upon the bottommost
slope of the big mountain where we were camp by a stream not more
than a hundr yard abov the timber line
at some time or other there had been a nativ villag at thi spot
probabl the zulu had clean it out in long past year for i
found human bone black with ag ly in the long grass inde the
cattlekra still remain and in such good condit that by pile
up a few stone here and there on the wall and close the narrow
entranc with thorn bush we could still us it to enclos our oxen
at night thi i did for fear lest there should be lion about though i
had neither seen nor heard them
so the dai went by pleasantli enough with lot to eat sinc whenev
we want meat i had onli to go a few yard to shoot a fat buck at a
spot whither thei trek to drink in the even till at last came the
time of full moon of thi i wa also glad sinc to tell the truth i
had begun to be bore rest is good but for a man who ha alwai led an
activ life too much of it is veri bad for then he begin to think and
thought in larg dose is depress
of the fireeat umslopogaa there wa no sign so i made up my mind
that on the morrow i would start after those eleph and when i had
shotor fail to shootsom of them return to natal i felt unabl
to remain idl ani more it never wa my gift to do so which is perhap
why i emploi my ampl leisur here in england in jot down such
reminisc as these
well the full moon came up in silver glori and after i had taken a good
look at her for luck also at all the veld within sight i turn in an
hour or two later some nois from the direct of the cattlekra woke
me up as it did not recur i thought that i would go to sleep again
then an uneasi thought came to me that i could not rememb have
look to see whether the entranc wa properli close as it wa
my habit to do it wa the same sort of troublesom doubt which in
a civilis hous make a man get out of bed and go along the cold
passag to the sittingroom to see whether he ha put out the lamp
it alwai prove that he ha put it out but that doe not prevent a
repetit of the perform next time the perplex aris
i reflect that perhap the nois wa caus by the oxen push their
wai through the carelesslyclos entranc and at ani rate that i had
better go to see so i slip on my boot and a coat and went without
wake han or the boi onli take with me a load singlebarrel
rifl which i us for shoot small buck but no spare cartridg
now in front of the gatewai of the cattlekra shade it grew a
singl big tree of the wild fig order pass under thi tree i look
and saw that the gatewai wa quit secur close as now i rememb
i had note at sunset then i start to go back but had not step
more than two or three pace when in the bright moonlight i saw the
head of my smallest ox a beast of the zulu breed suddenli appear
over the top of the wall about thi there would have been noth
particularli astonish had it not been for the fact that thi head
belong to a dead anim as i could tell from the close ey and the
hang tongu
what in the name of good i began to myself when my
reflect were cut short by the appear of anoth head that of
on of the biggest lion i ever saw which had the ox by the throat and
with the enorm strength that is given to these creatur by get
it back beneath the bodi wa deliber hoist it over the wall
to drag it awai to devour at it leisur
there wa the brute within twelv feet of me and what is more it saw
me as i saw it and stop still hold the ox by the throat
what a chanc for allan quatermain of cours he shot it dead on can
fanci anyon sai who know me by reput also that by the gift of
god i am handi with a rifl well inde it should have been for even
with the smallbor piec that i carri a bullet ought to have pierc
through the soft part of it throat to the brain and to have kill
that lion as dead as juliu csar theoret the thing wa easi
enough inde although i wa startl for a moment by the time that
i had the rifl to my shoulder i had littl fear of the issu unless
there wa a missfir especi as the beast seem so astonish that
it remain quit still
then the unexpect happen as gener it doe in life particularli
in hunt which in my case is a part of life i fire but by
misfortun the bullet struck the tip of the horn of that confound ox
which tip either wa or at that moment fell in front of the spot on the
lion throat whereat halfunconsci i had aim result the ball
wa turn and depart at an angl just cut the skin of the lion
neck deepli enough to hurt it veri much and to make it madder than all
the hatter in the world
drop the ox with a most terrif roar it came over the wall at
mei rememb that there seem to be yard of iti mean of the
lionin front of which appear a cavern mouth full of gleam
teeth
i skip back with much agil also a littl to on side becaus
there wa noth els to do reflect in a kind of inconsequ wai
that after all zikali great medicin wa not worth a curs the lion
land on my side of the wall and rear itself upon it hind leg
befor get to busi tower high abov me but slightli to my
left
then i saw a strang thing a shadow thrown by the moon flit past
meall i note of it wa the distort shape of a great lift ax
probabl becaus the ax came first the shadow fell and with it anoth
shadow that of a lion paw drop to the ground next there wa a
most aw nois of roar and wheel round i saw such a frai as
never i shall see again a tall grim black man wa fight the great
lion that now lack on paw but still stood upon it hind leg
strike at him with the other
the man who wa absolut silent dodg the blow and hit back with
the ax catch the beast upon the breast with such weight that it
came to the ground in a lopsid fashion sinc now it had onli on
forefoot on which to light
the ax flash up again and befor the lion could recov itself or do
anyth els fell with a crash upon it skull sink deep into the
head after thi all wa over for the beast brain wa cut in two
i am here at the appoint time macumazahn said umslopogaa for it
wa he as with difficulti he drag hi ax from the lion sever
skull to find you watch by night as it is report that you alwai
do
no i retort for hi tone irrit me you ar late bulalio the
moon ha been up some hour
i said o macumazahn that i would meet you on the night of the full
moon not at the rise of the moon
that is true i repli mollifi and at ani rate you came at a
good moment
ye he answer though as it happen in thi clear light the thing
wa easi to anyon who can handl an ax had it been darker the end
might have been differ but macumazahn you ar not so clever as i
thought sinc otherwis you would not have come out against a lion with
a toi like that and he point to the littl rifl in my hand
i did not know that there wa a lion umslopogaa
that is why you ar not so clever as i thought sinc of on sort or
anoth there is alwai a lion which wise men should be prepar to
meet macumazahn
you ar right again i repli
at that moment han arriv upon the scene follow at a discreet
distanc by the waggon boi and took in the situat at a glanc
the great medicin of the openerofroad ha work well wa all he
said
the great medicin of the openerofhead ha work better remark
umslopogaa with a littl laugh and point to hi red ax
never befor sinc she came into my keep ha inkosikaa ie
chieftai for so wa thi famou weapon name sunk so low as to
drink the blood of beast still the stroke wa a good on so she need
not be asham but yellow man how come it that you who i have been
told ar cun watch your master so ill
i wa asleep stutter han indignantli
those who serv should never sleep repli umslopogaa sternli then
he turn and whistl and behold out of the long grass that grew at a
littl distanc emerg twelv great men all of them bear ax and
wear cloak of hyena skin who salut me by rais their ax
set a watch and skin me thi beast by dawn it will make us a mat
said umslopogaa whereon again thei salut silent and melt awai
who ar these i ask
a few pick warrior whom i brought with me macumazahn there were
on or two more but thei got lost on the wai
then we went to the waggon and spoke no more that night
next morn i told umslopogaa of the visit i had receiv from the
induna of the king who wish me to come to the royal kraal he nod
and said
as it chanc certain thiev attack me on my journei which is why
on or two of my peopl remain behind who will never travel again we
made good plai with those thiev not on of them escap he
ad grimli and their bodi we threw into a river where ar mani
crocodil but their spear i brought awai and i think that thei ar
such as the king guard us if so hi search for them will be long
sinc the fight took place where no man live and we burn the shield
and trap oho he will think that the ghost have taken them
that morn we trek on fast fear lest a regiment search for
these thiev should strike and follow our spoor luckili the ox that
the lion had kill wa on of some spare cattl which i wa drive
with me so it loss did not inconveni us as we went umslopogaa
told me that he had duli appoint lousta and hi wife monazi to rule
the tribe dure hi absenc an offic which thei accept doubtfulli
monazi act as chieftai and lousta as her head induna or
councillor
i ask him whether he thought thi wise under all the circumst
see that it had occur to me sinc i made the suggest that thei
might be unwil to surrend power on hi return also that other
domest complic might ensu
it matter littl macumazahn he said with a shrug of hi great
shoulder for of thi i am sure that i have plai my part with the
peopl of the ax and to stop among them would have meant my death
who am a man betrai what do i care who love none and now have no
children still it is true that i might have fled to natal with the
cattl and there have led a fat and easi life but eas and plenti i do
not desir who would live and fall as a warrior should
never again mayhap shall i see the ghostmountain where the wolv
raven and the old witch sit in stone wait for the world to die
or sleep in the town of the peopl of the ax what do i want with wive
and oxen while i have inkosikaa the groanmak and she is true to
me he ad shake the ancient ax abov hi head so that the sun
gleam upon the curv blade and the hollow goug or point at the back
beyond the shaft socket where the ax goe there go the strength and
virtu of the ax o macumazahn
it is a strang weapon i said
ay a strang and an old forg far awai sai zikali by a
warriorwizard hundr of year ago a great fighter who wa also the
first of smith and who sit in the underworld wait for it to return
to hi hand when it work is finish beneath the sun that will be
soon macumazahn sinc zikali told me that i am the last holder of the
ax
did you then see the openerofroad i ask
ay i saw him he it wa who told me which wai to go to escap from
zululand also he laugh when he heard how the flood river brought
you to my kraal and sent you a messag in which he said that the spirit
of a snake had told him that you tri to throw the great medicin into
a pool but were stop by that snake whilst it wa still aliv thi
he said you must do no more lest he should send anoth snake to stop
you
did he i repli indignantli for zikali power of see or
learn about thing that happen at a distanc puzzl and annoi
me
onli han grin and said
i told you so baa
on we travel from dai to dai meet with such difficulti and
danger as ar common on roadless veld in africa but no more for the
grass wa good and there wa plenti of game of which we shot what we
want for meat inde here in the back region of what is known as
portugues south east africa everi sort of wild anim wa so numer
that person i wish we could turn our journei into a shoot
expedit
but of thi umslopogaa whom hunt bore would not hear in fact
he wa much more anxiou than myself to carri out our origin purpos
when i ask him why he answer becaus of someth zikali had told
him what thi wa he would not sai except that in the countri whither
we wander he would fight a great fight and win much honour
now umslopogaa wa by natur a fight man on who took a posit
joi in battl and like an old norseman seem to think that thu onli
could a man decor die thi amaz me a peac person who
love quiet and a home still i gave wai partli to pleas him partli
becaus i hope that we might discov someth of interest and still
more becaus have onc undertaken an enterpris my pride prompt me
to see it through
now while he wa prepar to draw hi map in the ash or afterward
i forget which zikali had told me that when we drew near to the great
river we should come to a place on the edg of bushveld that ran down
to the river where a white man live ad after cast hi bone
and read from them that he thought thi white man wa a trekboer
thi i should explain mean a dutchman who ha travel awai from
wherev he live and made a home for himself in the wilder as some
wander spirit and the desir to be free of author often prompt
these peopl to do also after anoth inspect of hi enchant
knucklebon he had declar that someth remark would happen to
thi man or hi famili while i wa visit him lastli in that map he
drew in the ash the detail of which were impress so indel
upon my memori he had shown me where i should find the dwell of thi
white man of whom and of whose habit doubtless he knew through
the mani spi who seem to be at the servic of all witchdoctor and
more especi of zikali the greatest among them
travel by the sun and the compress i had trek steadili in
the exact direct which he indic to find that in thi us
particular he wa well name the openerofroad sinc alwai befor
me i found a practic path although to the right or to the left
there would have been none thu when we came to mountain it wa at a
spot where we discov a pass when we came to swamp it wa where a
ridg of high ground ran between and so forth also such tribe as we
met upon our journei alwai prove of a friendli charact although
perhap the aspect of umslopogaa and hi fierc band whom rather
irrever i name hi twelv apostl had a share in induc thi
peac attitud
so smooth wa our progress and so well mark by water at certain
interv that at last i came to the conclus that we must be
follow some ancient road which at a forgotten period of histori had
run from south to north or vice ver or rather to be honest it
wa the observ han who made thi discoveri from variou indic
which had escap my notic i need not stop to detail them but on
of these wa that at certain place the waterhol on a high rather
barren land had been dug out and in on or more instanc line with
stone after the fashion of an ancient well evid we were follow
an old trade rout made perhap in forgotten ag when africa wa more
civilis than it is now
pass over certain high misti land dure the third week of our
trek where frequent at thi season of the year the sun never show
itself befor ten oclock and disappear at three or four in the
afternoon and where twice we were held up for two whole dai by dens
fog we came across a queer nomad peopl who seem to live in movabl
grass hut and to keep great herd of goat and longtail sheep
these folk ran awai from us at first but when thei found that we did
them no harm becam friendli and brought us offer of milk also of
a kind of slug or caterpillar which thei seem to eat han who wa
a great master of differ nativ dialect discov a tongu or a
mixtur of tongu in which he could make himself understood to some of
them
thei told him that in their dai thei had never seen a white man
although their father father an express by which thei meant their
remot ancestor had known mani of them thei ad howev that if
we went on steadili toward the north for anoth seven dai journei
we should come to a place where a white man live on thei had heard
who had a long beard and kill anim with gun as we did
encourag by thi intellig we push forward now travel down
hill out of the mist into a more genial countri inde the veld
here wa beauti high roll plain like those of the east african
plateau cover with a deep and fertil chocolatecolour soil as
we could see where the rain had wash out donga the climat too
seem to be cool and veri health altogeth it wa a piti to see
such land ly idl and tenant onli by countless herd of game for
there were not ani nativ inhabit or at least we met none
on we trek our road still slope slightli down hill till at length
we saw far awai a vast sea of bushveld which as i guess correctli
must fring the great zambesi river moreov we or rather han whose
ey were those of a hawk saw someth els name build of a
more or less civilis kind which stood among tree by the side of a
stream sever mile on thi side of the great belt of bush
look baa said han those wander did not lie there is the
hous of the white man i wonder if he drink anyth stronger than
water he ad with a sigh and a kind of reminisc contract of
hi yellow throat
as it happen he did
chapter v
inez
we had sight the hous from far awai shortli after sunris and by
middai we were there as we approach i saw that it stood almost
immedi beneath two great baobab tree babyan tree we call them in
south africa perhap becaus monkei eat their fruit it wa a thatch
hous with whitewash wall and a stoep or veranda round it appar
of the ordinari dutch type moreov beyond it at a littl distanc
were other hous or rather shanti with waggon shed etc and
beyond and mix up with these a number of nativ hut further on were
consider field green with spring corn also we saw herd of
cattl graze on the slope evid our white man wa rich
umslopogaa survei the place with a soldier ey and said to me
thi must be a peac countri macumazahn where no attack is fear
sinc of defenc i see none
ye i answer why not with a wilder behind it and bushveld
and a great river in front
men can cross river and travel through bushveld he answer and
wa silent
up to thi time we had seen no on although it might have been presum
that a waggon trek toward the hous wa a suffici unusu
sight to have attract attent
where can thei be i ask
asleep baa i think said han and as a matter of fact he wa
right the whole popul of the place wa indulg in a noondai
siesta
at last we came so near to the hous that i halt the waggon and
descend from the drivingbox in order to investig at thi moment
someon did appear the sight of whom astonish me not a littl
name a veri strikinglook young woman she wa tall handsom
with larg dark ey good featur a rather pale complexion and i
think the saddest face that i ever saw evid she had heard the
nois of the waggon and had come out to see what caus it for she
had noth on her head which wa cover with thick hair of a raven
black catch sight of the great umslopogaa with hi gleam ax
and of hi savagelook bodyguard she utter an exclam and not
unnatur turn to fly
it all right i sang out emerg from behind the oxen and in
english though befor the word had left my lip i reflect that there
wa not the slightest reason to suppos that she would understand them
probabl she wa dutch or portugues although by some instinct i had
address her in english
to my surpris she answer me in the same tongu spoken it is true
with a peculiar accent which i could not place as it wa neither scotch
nor irish
thank you she said i sir wa frighten your friend look
here she stumbl for a word then ad terroci

to sai
my name is inez robertson she answer i will go to wake my father
meanwhil pleas unyok your oxen thei can feed with the other thei
look as though thei want rest poor thing then she turn and went
into the hous
inez robertson i said to myself that a queer combin english
father and portugues mother i suppos but what can an englishman be
do in a place like thi if it had been a trekboer i should not have
been surpris then i began to give direct about outspan
we had just got the oxen out of the yoke when a big rawbon
redbeard blueei roughlyclad man of about fifti year of ag
appear from the hous yawn i threw my ey over him as he advanc
with a peculiar roll gait and form certain conclus a drunkard
who ha onc been a gentleman i reflect to myself for there wa
someth peculiarli dissolut in hi appear also on who ha had
to do with the sea a diagnosi which prove veri accur
how do you do mr allan quatermain which i think my daughter said is
your name unless i dream it for it is on that i seem to have heard
befor he exclaim with a broad scotch accent which i do not attempt
to reproduc what in the name of blaze bring you here where no real
white man ha been for year well i am glad enough to see you ani wai
for i am sick of halfbre portugues and nigger and snuffandbutt

compani will want food as well ill have a beast kill for them
thei look as if thei could eat it horn and all where ar my peopl
all asleep i suppos the lazi lubber wait a bit ill wake them up
go to the hous he snatch a great sjambok cut from hippopotamu
hide from where it hung on a nail in the wall and ran toward the
group of hut which i have mention roar out the name thomaso also
a string of oath such as seamen us mix with other of a portugues
varieti what happen there i could not see becaus bough were in
the wai but present i heard blow and scream and caught sight of
peopl all darkskin fly from the hut
a littl later a fat halfbre mani should sai from hi curl hair
that hi mother wa a negress and hi father a portugueseappear
with some other nondescript fellow and began to give direct in a
compet fashion about our oxen also as to the kill of a calf he
spoke in bastard portugues which i could understand and i heard him
talk of umslopogaa to whom he point as that nigger after the
fashion of such crossbr peopl who choos to consid themselv
white men also he made uncomplimentari remark about han who of
cours understood everi word he said evid thomaso temper had
been ruffl by thi sudden and violent disturb of hi nap
just then our host appear puf with hi exert and declar
that he had stir up the swine with a vengeanc in proof of which he
point to the sjambok that wa redden with blood
captain robertson i said i wish to give you a hint to be pass on
to mr thomaso if that is he he spoke of the zulu soldier there as a
nigger etc well he is a chief of a high rank and rather a terribl
fellow if rous therefor i recommend mr thomaso not to let him
understand that he is insult him
oh that the wai of these snuffandbutt on of whose
grandmoth onc met a white man repli the captain laugh but
ill tell him and he did in portugues
hi retain listen in silenc look at umslopogaa rather sulkili
then we walk into the hous as we went the captain said
seor thomasoh call himself seori my manag here and a clever
man honest too in hi wai and attach to me perhap becaus i
save hi life onc but he ha a nasti temper as have all these
crossbre so i hope he wont get wrong with that nativ who carri
a big ax
i hope so too for hi own sake i repli emphat
the captain led the wai into the sittingroom there wa but on in the
hous it prove a queer kind of place with rude furnitur seat with
strip of hide after the boer fashion and yet bear a certain air of
refin which wa doubtless due to inez who with the assist
of a stout nativ girl wa alreadi engag in set the tabl
thu there wa a shelf with book shakespear wa on of these i
noticedov which hung an ivori crucifix which suggest that inez
wa a cathol on the wall too were some good portrait and on the
windowledg a jar full of flower also the fork and spoon were of
silver as were the mug and engrav with a tremend coatofarm
and a portugues motto
present the food appear which wa excel and plenti and the
captain hi daughter and i sat down and at i note that he drank gin
and water an innocentlook beverag but strong as he took it it wa
offer to me but like miss inez i prefer coffe
dure the meal and afterward while we smoke upon the veranda i
told them as much as i thought desir of my plan i said that i wa
engag upon a journei of explor of the countri beyond the zambesi
and that have heard of thi settlement which by the wai wa call
strathmuir as i gather after a place in far awai scotland where
the captain had been born and pass hi childhood i had come here to
inquir as to how to cross the great river and about other thing
the captain wa interest especi when i inform him that i wa
that same hunter quatermain of whom he had heard in past year but he
told me that it would be imposs to take the waggon down into the low
bushveld which we could see beneath us as there all the oxen would die
of the bite of the tsets fly i answer that i wa awar of thi and
propos to try to make an arrang to leav it in hi charg till i
return
that might be manag mr quatermain he answer but man will
you ever return thei sai there ar queer folk live on the other side
of the zambesi savag men who ar cannib amahagg i think thei
call them it wa thei who in past year clean out all thi countri
except a few river tribe who live in float hut or on island among
the reed and that why it is so empti but thi happen long ago
much befor my time and i dont suppos thei will ever cross the river
again
if i might ask what brought you here captain i said for the point
wa on on which i felt curiou
that which bring most men to wild place mr quatermaintroubl if
you want to know i had a misfortun and pile up my ship there were
some live lost and rightli or wrongli i got the sack then i start
as a trader in a godforsaken hole name chind on of the zambesi
mouth you know and did veri well as we scotchmen have a wai of
do
there i marri a portugues ladi a real ladi of high blood on of
the old sort when my girl inez wa about twelv year old i got into
more troubl for my wife di and it pleas a certain rel of her
to sai that it wa becaus i had neglect her thi end in a row and
the truth is that i kill himin fair fight mind you still kill him
i did though i scarc knew that i had done it at the time after which
the place grew too hot to hold me so i sold up and swore that i would
have no more to do with what thei ar pleas to call civilis on
the east coast
dure my trade i had heard that there wa fine countri up thi wai
and here i came and settl year ago bring my girl and thomaso who
wa on of my manag also a few other peopl with me and here i have
been ever sinc do veri well as befor for i trade a lot of ivori
and other thing and grow stuff and cattl which i sell to the river
nativ ye i am a rich man now and could go to live on my mean in
scotland or anywher
why dont you i ask
oh for mani reason i have lost touch with all that and becom half
wild and i like thi life and the sunshin and be my own master
also if i did thing might be rake up against me about that man
death also though i daresai it will make you think badli of me for it
mr quatermain i have ti down there and he wave is hand toward
the villag if so it could be call which it wouldnt be easi for
me to break a man mai be fond of hi children mr quatermain even
if their skin aint so white as thei ought to be lastli i have
habitsy see i am speak out to you as man to manwhich might get
me into troubl again if i went back to the world and he nod hi
fine capablelook head in the direct of the bottl on the tabl
i see i said hastili for thi kind of confess burst out of
the man lone heart when what he had drunk took a hold of him wa
pain to hear but how about your daughter miss inez
ah he said with a quiver in hi voic there you touch it she
ought to go awai there is no on for her to marri here where we
havent seen a white man for year and she a ladi right enough like
her mother but who is she to go to be a roman cathol whom my own
dour presbyterian folk in scotland if ani of them ar left would turn
their back on moreov she love me in her own fashion as i love
her and she wouldnt leav me becaus she think it her duti to
stai and know that if she did i should go to the devil altogeth
stillperhap you might help me about her mr quatermain that is if
you live to come back from your journei he ad doubtfulli
i felt inclin to ask how i could possibl help in such a matter but
thought it wisest to sai noth thi howev he did not notic for
he went on
now i think i will have a nap as i do my work in the earli morn
and sometim late at night when my brain seem to clear up again for
you see i wa a sailor for mani year and accustom to keep watch
youll look after yourself wont you and treat the place as your own
then he vanish into the hous to lie down
when i had finish my pipe i went for a walk first i visit the
waggon where i found umslopogaa and hi compani engag in cook
the beast that had been given them zulu fashion han with hi usual
cun had alreadi secur a meal probabl from the servant or from
inez herself at least he left them and follow me first we went down
to the hut where we saw a number of goodlook young women of mix
blood all decent dress and engag about their household duti
also we saw four or five boi and girl to sai noth of a babi
in arm fine young peopl on or two of whom were more white than
colour
those children ar veri like the baa with the red beard remark
han reflect
ye i said and shiver for now i understood the aw of thi
poor man case he wa the father of a number of halfbre who ti
him to thi spot as anchor tie a ship i went on rather hastili past
some shed to a long low build which prove to be a store here
the quarterblood call thomaso and some assist were engag in
trade with nativ from the zambesi swamp men of a kind that i had
never seen but in a wai more civilis than mani further south what
thei were sell or bui i did not stop to see but i notic that
the store wa full of good of on sort or anoth includ a great
deal of ivori which as i suppos had come down the river from
inland
then we walk on to the cultiv field where we saw corn grow
veri well also tobacco and other crop beyond thi were cattl kraal
and in the distanc we perceiv a great number of cattl and goat
feed on the slope
thi redbeard baa must be veri rich in all thing remark the
observ han when we had complet our investig
ye i answer rich and yet poor
how can a man be both rich and yet poor baa ask han
just at that moment some of the halfbre children whom i have
mention ran past us more nake than dress and whoop like littl
savag han contempl them grave then said
i think i understand now baa a man mai be rich in thing he love
and yet doe not want which make him poor in other wai
ye i answer as you ar han when you take too much to
drink
just then we met the state miss inez return from the store
carri some articl in a basket soap i think and tea in a packet
amongst them i told han to take the basket and bear it to the
hous for her he went off with it and walk slowli we fell into
convers
your father must do veri well here i said nod at the store with
the crowd of nativ round it
ye she answer he make much monei which he put in a bank at the
coast for live cost us noth and there is great profit in what he
bui and sell also in the crop he grow and in the cattl but she
ad pathet what is the us of monei in a place like thi
you can get thing with it i answer vagu
that is what my father sai but what doe he get strong stuff to
drink dress for those women down there and sometim pearl jewel
and other thing for me which i do not want i have a box full of them
set in ugli gold or loos which i cannot us and if i put them on who
is there to see them that clever halfbre thomasofor he is clever
in hi wai faith tooor the women down thereno on els
you do not seem to be happi miss inez
no i cannot tell how unhappi other ar who have met none but
sometim i think that i must be the most miser woman in the world
oh no i repli cheerfulli plenti ar wors off
then mr quatermain it must be becaus thei cannot feel did you ever
have a father whom you love
ye miss inez he is dead but he wa a veri good man a kind of
saint ask my servant the littl hottentot han he will tell you about
him
ah a veri good man well as you mai have guess mine is not though
there is much good in him for he ha a kind heart and a big brain but
the drink and those women down there thei ruin him and she wrung her
hand

becaus it is my duti to stop that is what my religion teach me
although of it i know littl except through book who have seen no

then with a sudden flash of her dark ey that said more than all her
word she turn and left me
here a pretti kettl of fish thought i to myself as i stroll back
to the waggon to see how thing were go on there and how to get the
live fish out of the kettl befor thei boil or spoil is more than i
know i wonder why fate is alwai find me such job to do
even as i thought thu a voic in my heart seem to echo that poor
girl wordsbecaus it is your dutyand to add other to themwo
betid him who neglect hi duti i wa appoint to try to hook a few
fish out of the vast kettl of human woe and therefor i must go on
hook meanwhil thi particular problem seem beyond me perhap
fate would help i reflect as a matter of fact in the end fate did
if fate is the right word to us in thi connect
chapter vi
the seacow hunt
now it had been my intent to push forward across the river at onc
but here luck or our old friend fate wa against me to begin with
sever of umslopogaa men fell sick with a kind of stomach troubl
aris no doubt from someth thei had eaten thi howev wa not
their view or that of umslopogaa himself it happen that on of
these men goroko by name who practis as a witchdoctor in hi
lighter moment natur suspect that a spell had been cast upon
them for such peopl see magic in everyth
therefor he organis a smellingout at which umslopogaa who wa
as superstiti as the rest assist so did han although he call
himself a christian partli out of curios for he wa as curiou as
a magpi and partli from fear lest some implic should be brought
against him in hi absenc i saw the busi go on from a littl
distanc and unseen myself thought it well to keep an ey upon the
proceed in case anyth untoward should occur thi i did with miss
inez who had never wit anyth of the sort as a companion
the circl a small on wa form in the usual fashion goroko rig
up in the best witchdoctor costum that he could improvis duli
came under the influenc of hi spirit and skip about wave a
wildebeest tail and so forth
final to my horror he broke out of the ring and run to a group
of spectat from the villag switch thomaso who wa stand among
them with a lordli and contemptu air across the face with the gnu
tail shout out that he wa the wizard who had poison the bowel of
the sick men thereon thomaso who although he could be insol like
most crossbre wa not remark for courag see the stir that
thi announc creat amongst the fiercefac zulu and fear
develop promptli bolt none attempt to follow him
after thi just as i thought that everyth wa over and that the time
had come for me to speak a few earnest word to umslopogaa point
out that matter must go no further as regard thomaso whom i knew that
he and hi peopl hate goroko went back to the circl and wa seiz
with a new burst of inspir
throw down hi whisk he lift hi arm abov hi head and stare at
the heaven then he began to shout out someth in a loud voic which
i wa too far off to catch whatev it mai have been evid it
frighten hi hearer as i could see from the express on their
face even umslopogaa wa alarm for he let hi ax fall for a
moment rose as though to speak then sat down again and cover hi
ey with hi hand
in a minut it wa over goroko seem to becom normal took some snuff
and as i guess after the usual fashion of these doctor began to
ask what he had been sai while the spirit possess him which he
either had or affect to have forgotten the circl too broke up
and it member began to talk to each other in a subdu wai while
umslopogaa remain seat on the ground brood and han slip
awai in hi snakelik fashion doubtless in search of me
what wa it all about mr quatermain ask inez
oh a lot of nonsens i said i fanci that witchdoctor declar
that your friend thomaso put someth into those men food to make
them sick
i daresai that he did it would be just like him mr quatermain as i
know that he hate them especi umslopogaa of whom i am veri fond
he brought me some beauti flower thi morn which he had found
somewher and made a long speech which i could not understand
the idea of umslopogaa that man of blood and iron bring flower
to a young ladi wa so absurd that i broke out laugh and even the
sadfac inez smile then she left me to see about someth and i
went to speak to han and ask him what had happen
someth rather queer i think baa he answer vacuous though
i did not quit understand the last part the doctor goroko smelt out
thomaso as the man who had made them sick and though thei will not kill
him becaus we ar guest here those zulu ar veri angri with thomaso
and i think will beat him if thei get a chanc but that is onli the
small half of the stick and he paus
what is the big half then i ask with irrit
baa the spirit in goroko
the jackass in goroko you mean i interrupt how can you who ar
a christian talk such rubbish about spirit i onli wish that my father
could hear you
oh baa your reverend father the predik is now wise enough
to know all about spirit and that there ar some who come into black
witchdoctor though thei turn up their nose at white men and leav
them alon howev whatev it is that make goroko speak got hold
of him so that hi lip said though he rememb noth of it
afterward that soon thi place would be red with bloodthat there
would be a great kill here baa that is all
red with blood whose blood what did the fool mean
i dont know baa but what you call the jackass in goroko declar
that those who ar with the great medicinemean what you wear
baaswil be quit safe so i hope that it will not be our blood also
that you will get out of thi place as soon as you can
well i scold han becaus he believ in what thi doctor said for
i could see that he did believ it then went to question umslopogaa
whom i found look quit pleas which annoi me still more
what is it that goroko ha been sai and why do you smile bulalio
i ask
noth much macumazahn except that the man who look like tallow
that ha gone bad put someth in our food which made us sick for
which i would kill him were he not redbeard servant and that it would
frighten the ladi hi daughter also he said that soon there will be
fight which is why i smile who grow weari of peac we came out to
fight did we not
certainli not i answer we came out to make a quiet journei in
strang land which is what i mean to do
ah well macumazahn in strang land on meet strang men with whom
on doe not alwai agre and then inkosikaa begin to talk and he
whirl the great ax round hi head make the air whistl as it wa
forc through the goug at it back
i could get no more out of him so have extract a promis from him
that noth should happen to thomaso who i point out wa probabl
quit unjustli accus i went awai
still the whole incid left a disagre impress on my mind
and i began to wish that we were safe across the zambesi without more
troubl but we could not start at onc becaus two of the zulu were
still not well enough to travel and there were mani prepar to
be made about the load and so forth sinc the waggon must be left
behind also and thi wa anoth complicationhan had a sore upon
hi foot result from the prick of a poison thorn and it wa
desir that thi should be quit heal befor we march
so it came about that i wa realli glad when captain robertson suggest
that we should go down to a certain swamp form i gather by some
small tributari of the zambesi to take part in a kind of hippopotamu
battu it seem that at thi season of the year these great anim
alwai frequent the place in number also that by bar a neck of
deep water through which thei gain it thei or a proport of them
could be cut off and kill
thi had been done onc or twice in the past though not of late
perhap becaus captain robertson had lack the energi to organis such
a hunt now he wish to do so again take advantag of my presenc
both becaus of the valu of the hide of the seacow which were cut up
to be sent to the coast and sold as sjambok or whip and becaus of
the sport of the thing also i think he desir to show me that he wa
not altogeth sunk in sloth and drink
i fell in with the idea readili enough sinc in all my hunt life i
had never seen anyth of the sort especi as i wa told that the
expedit would not take more than a week and i reckon that the sick
men and han would not be fit to travel sooner so great prepar
were made the riversid nativ whose share of the spoil wa to be the
carcas of the slain seacow were summon by hundr and sent off
to their appoint station to beat the swamp at a signal given by the
fire of a great pile of reed also mani other thing were done upon
which i need not enter
then came the time for us to depart to the appoint spot over twenti
mile awai most of which distanc it seem we could trek in the
waggon captain robertson who for the time had cut off hi gin wa
as activ about the affair as though he were onc more in command of a
mailsteam noth escap hi attent inde in the care which
he gave to detail he remind me of the captain of a great ship that
is leav port and from it i learn how abl a man he must onc have
been
doe your daughter accompani us i ask on the night befor we
start
oh no he answer she would onli be in the wai she will be quit
safe here especi as thomaso who is no hunter remain in charg
of the place with some of the older nativ to look after the women and
children
later i saw inez herself who said that she would have like to come
although she hate to see great beast kill but that her father wa
against it becaus he thought she might catch fever so she suppos
that she had better remain where she wa
i agre though in my heart i wa doubt and said that i would leav
han whose foot wa not as yet quit well and with whom she had made
friend as she had done with umslopogaa to look after her also there
would be with him the two great zulu who were now recov from their
attack of stomach sick so that she would have noth to fear she
answer with her slow smile that she fear noth still she would
have like to come with us then we part as it prove for a long
time
it wa quit a ceremoni umslopogaa in the name of the ax solemnli
gave over inez to the charg of hi two follow bid them guard
her with so much earnest that i began to suspect he fear someth
which he did not choos to mention my mind went back inde to the
propheci of the witchdoctor goroko of which it wa possibl that he
might be think but as while he spoke he kept hi fierc ey fix
upon the fat and pompou quarterbre thomaso i conclud that here
wa the object of hi doubt
it might have occur to him that thi thomaso would take the
opportun of her father absenc to annoi inez if so i wa sure that
he wa mistaken for variou reason of which i need onli quot on
name that even if such an idea had ever enter hi head thomaso wa
far too great a coward to translat it into action still suspect
someth i also gave han instruct to keep a sharp ey on inez
and gener to watch the place and if he saw anyth suspici to
commun with us at onc
ye baa said han i will look after sadeyesfor so with
their usual quick of observ our zulu had name ineza
though she were my grandmoth though what there is to fear for her i
do not know but baa i would much rather come and look after you as
your reverend father the predik told me to do alwai which is my
duti not girlherd baa also my foot is now quit well andi want
to shoot seacow and here he paus
and what han
and goroko said that there wa go to be much fight and if there
should be fight and you should come to harm becaus i wa not there
to protect you what would your reverend father think of me then
all of which meant two thing that han never like be separ
from me if he could help it and that he much prefer a shoot trip
to stop alon in thi strang place with noth to do except eat
and sleep so i conclud though inde i did not get quit to the
bottom of the busi in realiti han wa put up a most gallant
struggl against temptat
as i found out afterward captain robertson had been give him strong
drink on the sly move thereto by sympathi with a fellow toper also he
had shown him where if he want it he could get more and han alwai
want gin veri badli inde to leav it within hi reach wa like
leav a hand of diamond ly about in the room of a thief thi
he knew but wa asham to tell me the truth and thenc came much
troubl
you will stop here han look after the young ladi and nurs your
foot i said sternli whereon he collaps with a sigh and ask for
some tobacco
meanwhil captain robertson who i think had been take a stirrup cup
to cheer him on the road wa make hi farewel down in what wa
known as the villag for i saw him there kiss a collect of
halfbre children and give thomaso instruct to look after them
and their mother return at length he call to inez who remain
upon the veranda for she alwai seem to shrink from her father after
hi visit to the villag to keep a stiff upper lip and not feel
lone and command the cavalcad to start
so off we went about twenti of the villag nativ a motlei crew arm
with everi kind of gun march ahead and sing song then came the
waggon with captain robertson and myself seat on the drivingbox
and lastli umslopogaa and hi zulu except the two who had been left
behind
we trek along a kind of nativ road over fine veld of the same
charact as that on which strathmuir stood have the lowerli
bushveld which ran down to the zambesi on our right befor nightfal
we came to a ridg whereon thi bushveld turn south fring that
tributari of the great river in the swamp of which we were to hunt for
seacow here we camp and next morn leav the waggon in charg
of my voorloop and a coupl of the strathmuir nativ for the
driver wa to act as my gunbearerw march down into the sea of
bushveld it prove to be full of game but at thi we dare not fire
for fear of disturb the hippopotami in the swamp beneath whenc
in that event thei might escap us back to the river
about middai we pass out of the bushveld and reach the place where
the drive wa to be here border by steep bank cover with bush
wa swampi ground not more than two hundr yard wide down the centr
of which ran a narrow channel of rather deep water drain a vast
expans of morass abov it wa up thi channel that the seacow
travel to the feed ground where thei love to collect at that
season of the year
there with the assist of some of the riversid nativ we made our
prepar under the direct of captain robertson the rest of these
men to the number of sever hundr had made a wide dtour to the
head of the swamp mile awai whenc thei were to advanc at a certain
signal these prepar were simpl a quantiti of thorn tree were
cut down and by mean of heavi stone fasten to their trunk anchor
in the narrow channel of deep water to their top which float on the
placid surfac were ti a varieti of rag which we had brought with
us such as old red flannel shirt gaycolour but wornout blanket
and i know not what besid some of these fragment also were attach
to the anchor rope under water
also we select place for the gun upon the steep bank that i have
mention between which thi channel ran forese what would happen
i chose on for myself behind a particularli stout rock and what is
more built a stone wall to the height of sever feet on the landward
side of it as i guess that the nativ post near to me would prove
wild in their shoot
these labour occupi the rest of that dai and at night we retir to
higher ground to sleep befor dawn on the follow morn we return
and took up our station some on on side of the channel and some on
the other which we had to reach in a cano brought for the purpos by
the river nativ
then befor the sun rose captain robertson fire a huge pile of dri
reed and bush which wa to give the signal to the river nativ
far awai to begin their beat thi done we sat down and wait after
make sure that everi gun had plenti of ammunit readi
as the dawn broke by climb a tree near my schanz or shelter i
saw a good mani mile awai to the south a wide circl of littl fire
and guess that the nativ were begin to burn the dry reed of the
swamp present these fire drew togeth into a thin wall of flame
then i knew that it wa time to return to the schanz and prepar it
wa full daylight howev befor anyth happen
watch the still channel of water i saw rippl on it and bubbl
of air rise suddenli there appear the head of a great
bullhippopotamu which have caught sight of our rag barricad
either abov or below water had risen to the surfac to see what it
might be i put a bullet from an eightbor rifl through it brain
whereon it sank as i guess stone dead to the bottom of the channel
thu help to increas the barricad by the bulk of it great bodi
also it had anoth effect i have observ that seacow cannot bear
the smell and taint of blood which frighten them horribl so that
thei will expos themselv to almost ani risk rather than get it into
their nostril
now in thi still water where there wa no percept current the
blood from the dead bull soon spread all about so that when the herd
follow their leader began to arriv thei were much alarm inde
the first of them on wind or tast it turn and tri to get
back up the channel where howev thei met other follow and
there ensu a tremend confus thei rose to the surfac blow
snort bellow and scrambl over each other in the water while
continu more and more arriv behind them till there wa a perfect
pandemonium in that narrow place
all our gun open fire wildli upon the mass it wa like a battl
and through the smoke i caught sight of the riversid nativ who were
act as beater advanc far awai fantast dress scream
with excit and wave spear or sometim torch of flame
reed most of these were scrambl along the bank but some of
the bolder spirit advanc over the lagoon in cano drive the
hippopotami toward the mouth of the channel by which alon thei could
escap into the great swamp below and so on to the river in all my
hunt experi i do not think i ever saw a more remark scene
still in a wai to me it wa unpleas for i flatter myself that i am
a sportsman and a battl of thi sort is not sport as i understand the
term
at length it came to thi the channel for quit a long wai wa
liter full of hippopotamii should think there must have been a
hundr of them or more of all sort and size from great bull down to
littl calv some of these were kill not mani for the shoot of
our gallant compani wa execr and almost at hazard also for everi
seacow that di of which number i think that captain robertson and
myself account for mostmani were onli wound
still the unhappi beast craze with nois and fire and blood did not
seem to dare to face our frail barricad probabl for the reason that
i have given for a while thei remain mass togeth in the water or
under it make a most horribl nois then of a sudden thei seem to
take a resolut a few of them broke back toward the burn reed
the scream beater and the advanc cano on of these inde
a wound bull charg a cano crush it in it huge jaw and kill
the rower how exactli i do not know for hi bodi wa never found the
major of them howev took anoth counsel for emerg from the
water on either side thei began to scrambl toward us along the steep
bank or even to climb up them with surpris agil it wa at thi
point in the proceed that i congratul myself earnestli upon
the solid charact of the waterworn rock which i had select as a
shelter
behind thi rock togeth with my gunbear and umslopogaa who as
he did not shoot had elect to be my companion i crouch and bang
awai at the unwieldi creatur as thei advanc but fire fast as i
might with two rifl i could not stop the half of themthei were
draw unpleasantli near i glanc at umslopogaa and even then
wa amus to see that probabl for the first time in hi life that
redoubt warrior wa in a genuin fright
thi is mad macumazahn he shout abov the din ar we to stop
here and be stamp flat by a hord of waterpig
it seem so i answer unless you prefer to be stamp flat
outsideor eaten i ad point to a great crocodil that had also
emerg from the channel and wa come along toward us with open jaw
by the ax shout umslopogaa again ia warriorwil not die
thu trodden on like a slug by an ox
now i have mention a tree which i climb in hi extrem
umslopogaa rush for that tree and went up it like a lamplight just
as the crocodil wriggl past it trunk snap at hi retreat
leg
after thi i took no more note of him partli becaus of the advanc
seacow and more for the reason that on of the villag nativ post
abov me fire wildli put a larg round bullet through the sleev
of my coat inde had it not been for the wall which i built that
protect us i am certain that both my bearer and i would have been
kill for afterward i found it splash over with lead from bullet
which had struck the stone
well thank to the strength of my rock and to the wall or as han said
afterward to zikali great medicin we escap unhurt the rush went
by me inde i kill on seacow so close that the powder from the
rifl actual burn it hide but it did go by leav us untouch
all howev were not so fortun sinc of the villag nativ two
were trampl to death while a third had hi leg broken
also and thi wa realli amusinga bewild bull charg at full
speed crash into the trunk of umslopogaa tree and as it wa not
veri thick snap it in two down came the top in which the dignifi
chief wa ensconc like a bird in a nest though at that moment there
wa preciou littl digniti about him howev except for scratch he
wa not hurt as the hippopotamu had other busi in urgent need of
attent and did not stop to settl with him
such ar the thing which happen to a man who mix himself up with
matter of which he know noth said umslopogaa sententi to
me afterward but all the same he could never bear ani allus to thi
treeclimb episod in hi martial career which as it happen had
taken place in full view of hi retain among whom it remain the
greatest of joke inde he want to kill a man the wag of the
parti who gave him a slang name which be translat mean
hewhoissobravethathedarestorideawaterhorseupatre
it wa all over at last for which i thank provid devoutli a good
mani of the seacow were dead i think twentyon wa out exact bag
but the major of them had escap in on wai or anoth mani as i
fear wound i imagin that at the last the bulk of the herd overcam
it fear and swim through our screen pass awai down the channel
at ani rate thei were gone and have ascertain that there wa
noth to be done for the man who had been trampl on my side of the
channel i cross it in the cano with the object of return quietli
to our camp to rest
but as yet there wa to be no quiet for me for there i found captain
robertson who i think had been refresh himself out of a bottl and
wa in a great state of excit about a nativ who had been kill
near him who wa a favourit of hi and anoth whose leg wa broken
he declar vehement that the hippopotamu which had done thi had
been wound and rush into some bush a few hundr yard awai and
that he meant to take vengeanc upon it inde he wa just set off
to do so
see hi agit state i thought it wisest to follow him what
happen need not be set out in detail it is suffici to sai that
he found that hippopotamu and blaze both barrel at it in the bush
hit it but not serious out lumber the creatur with it mouth
open wish to escap robertson turn to fly as he wa in it path
but from on caus or anoth trip and fell down certainli he would
have been crush beneath it huge feet had i not step in front of
him and sent two solid eightbor bullet down that yawn throat
kill it dead within three feet of where robertson wa try to rise
and i mai add of myself
thi narrow escap sober him and i am bound to sai that hi gratitud
wa profus
you ar a brave man he said and had it not been for you by now i
should be wherev bad peopl go ill not forget it mr quatermain
and if ever you want anyth that john robertson can give why it
your
veri well i answer be seiz by an inspir i do want
someth that you can give easili enough
give it a name and it your half my place if you like
i want i went on as i slip new cartridg into the rifl i want
you to promis to give up drink for your daughter sake that what
nearli did for you just now you know
man you ask a hard thing he said slowli but by god ill try for
her sake and for your too
then i went to help to set the leg of the injur man which wa all the
rest i got that morn
chapter vii
the oath
we spent three more dai at that place first it wa necessari to allow
time to elaps befor the gase which gener in their great bodi
caus those of the seacow which had been kill in the water to
float then thei must be skin and their thick hide cut into strip
and piec to be trade for sjambok or to make small nativ shield
for which some of the east coast tribe will pai heavili
all thi took a long while dure which i amus or disgust myself
in watch those river nativ devour the flesh of the beast
the lean what there wa of it thei dri and smoke into a kind of
biltong but a great deal of the fat thei at at onc i had the
curios to weigh a lump which wa given to on thin hungrylook
fellow it scale quit twenti pound within four hour he had eaten it
to the last ounc and lai there a distend and torpid log what would
not we white peopl give for such a digest
at last all wa over and we start homeward the man with a broken leg
be carri in a kind of litter on the edg of the bushveld we found
the waggon quit safe also on of captain robertson that had follow
us from strathmuir in order to carri the expect load of hippopotamu
hide and ivori i ask my voorloop if anyth had happen dure
our absenc he answer noth but on the previou even after
dark he had seen a glow in the direct of strathmuir which lai on
somewhat lower ground about twenti mile awai as though numer fire
had been light there it struck him so much he ad that he
climb a tree to observ it better he did not think howev that ani
build had been burn there as the glow wa not strong enough for
that
i suggest that it wa caus by some grass fire or reedburn to
which he repli indiffer that he did not think so as the line of
the glow wa not suffici continu
there the matter end though i confess that the stori made me anxiou
for what exact reason i could not sai umslopogaa also who had
listen to it for our talk wa in zulu look grave but made no
remark but as sinc hi treeclimb experi he had been singularli
silent of thi i thought littl
we had trek at a time which we calcul would bring us to
strathmuir about an hour befor sundown allow for a short halt half
wai as my oxen were got in more quickli than those of the other waggon
after thi outspan i wa the first awai follow at a littl distanc
by umslopogaa who prefer to walk with hi zulu the truth wa that
i could not get that stori about the glow of fire out of my mind and
wa anxiou to push on which had caus me to hurri up the inspan
perhap we had cover a coupl of mile of the ten or twelv which
still lai between us and strathmuir when far off on the crest of on
of the wave of the veld which much resembl those of the swell sea
frozen while in motion i saw a small figur approach us at a rapid
trot somehow that figur suggest han to my mind so much so that i
fetch my glass to examin it more close a short scrutini through
them convinc me that han it wa han and no other advanc at a
great pace
fill with uneasi i order the driver to flog up the oxen
with the result that in a littl over five minut we met halt the
waggon i leapt from the waggonbox and call to umslopogaa who had
kept up with us at a slow swing trot went to han who when he saw
me stood still at a littl distanc swing hi apolog for a hat in
hi hand as wa hi fashion when asham or perplex
what is the matter han i ask when we were within speak
distanc
oh baa everyth he answer and i notic that he kept hi ey
fix upon the ground and that hi lip twitch
speak you fool and in zulu i said for by now umslopogaa had
join me
baa he answer in that tongu a terribl thing ha come about
at the farm of redbeard yonder yesterdai afternoon at the time when
peopl ar in the habit of sleep there till the sun grow less hot
a bodi of great men with fierc face who carri big spearsperhap
there were fifti of them baascrept up to the place through the long
grass and grow crop and attack it
did you see them come i ask
no baa i wa watch at a littl distanc as you bade me do and the
sun be hot i shut my ey to keep out the glare of it so that i did
not see them until thei had pass me and heard the nois
you mean that you were asleep or drunk han but go on
baa i do not know he answer shamefacedli but after that i
climb a tall tree with a kind of bush at the top of it i ascertain
afterward that thi wa a sort of leafycrown palm and from it i
saw everyth without be seen
what did you see han i ask him
i saw the big men run up and make a kind of circl round the villag
then thei shout and the peopl in the villag came out to see what
wa the matter thomaso and some of the men caught sight of them first
and ran awai fast into the hillsid at the back where the tree grow
befor the circl wa complet then the women and the children came out
and the big men kill them with their spearsal all
good god i exclaim and what happen at the hous and to the
ladi
baa some of the men had surround that also and when she heard the
nois the ladi sadey came out on to the stoep and with her came
the two zulu of the ax who had been left sick but were now quit
recov a number of the big men ran as though to take her but the
two zulu made a great fight in front of the littl step to the stoep
have their back protect by the stoep and kill six of them befor
thei themselv were kill also sadey shot on with a pistol she
carri and wound anoth so that the spear fell out of hi hand
then the rest fell on her and ti her up set her in a chair on
the stoep where two remain to watch her thei did her no hurt baa
inde thei seem to treat her as gentli as thei could also thei
went into the hous and there thei caught that tall fat yellow girl who
alwai smile and is call jane she who wait upon the ladi sadey
and brought her out to her i think thei told her baa that she must
look after her mistress and that if she tri to run awai she would be
kill for afterward i saw jane bring her food and other thing
and then han
then baa most of the great men rest a while though some of them
went through the store gather such thing as thei like blanket
knive and iron cookingpot but thei set fire to noth nor did thei
try to catch the cattl also thei took dry wood from the pile and lit
big fire eight or nine of them and when the sun set thei began to
feast
what did thei feast on han if thei took no cattl i ask with a
shiver for i wa afraid of i knew not what
baa answer han turn hi head awai and look at the ground
thei feast on the children whom thei had kill also on some of the
young women these tall soldier ar meneat baa
at thi horribl intellig i turn faint and felt as though i wa
go to fall but recov myself sign to him to go on with hi
stori
thei feast quit nice baa he continu make no nois then
some of them slept while other watch and that went on all night as
soon as it wa dark but befor the moon rose i slid down the tree and
crept round to the back of the hous without be seen or heard as
i can baa i got into the hous by the back door and crawl to
the window of the sittingroom it wa open and peep through i saw
sadey still ti to the seat on the stoep not more than a pace awai
while the girl jane crouch on the floor at her feeti think she wa
asleep or faint
i made a littl nois like a nightadd hiss and kept on make
it till at last sadey turn her head then i spoke in a veri low
whisper for fear lest i should wake the two guard who were doze on
either side of her wrap in their blanket sai it is i han
come to help you you cannot she answer also speak veri low
get to your master and tell him and my father to follow these men ar
call amahagg and live far awai across the river thei ar go to
take me to their home as i understand to rule them becaus thei want
a white woman to be a queen over them who have alwai been rule by a
certain white queen against whom thei have rebel i do not think
thei mean to do me ani harm unless perhap thei want to marri me
to their chief but of thi i am not sure from their talk which i
understand badli now go befor thei catch you
i think you might get awai i whisper back i will cut your bond
when you ar free slip through the window and i will guid you
veri well try it she said
so i drew my knife and stretch out my arm but then baa i show
myself a foolif the great medicin had still been there i might have
known better i forgot the starlight which shone upon the blade of the
knife that girl jane came out of her sleep or swoon lift her head
and saw the knife she scream onc then at a word from her mistress
wa silent but it wa enough for it woke up the guard who glare
about them and threaten jane with their great spear also thei went
to sleep no more but began to talk togeth though what thei said i
could not hear for i wa hide on the floor of the room after thi
know that i could do no good and might do harm and get myself kill
i crept out of the hous as i had crept in and crawl back to my
tree
why did you not come to me i ask
becaus i still hope i might be abl to help sadey baa also i
want to see what happen and i knew that i could not bring you here
in time to be ani good yet it is true i thought of come though i did
not know the road
perhap you were right
at the first dawn continu han the great men who ar call
amahagg rose and at what wa left over from the night befor then
thei gather themselv togeth and went to the hous here thei found
a larg chair that seat with rimpi in which the baa redbeard
sit and lash two pole to the chair beneath the chair thei ti
the garment and other thing of the ladi sadey which thei made
jane gather as sadey direct her thi done veri gentli thei sat
sadey herself in the chair bow while thei made her fast after
thi eight of them set the pole upon their shoulder and thei all went
awai at a trot head for the bushveld drive with them a herd of
goat which thei had stolen from the farm and make jane run by the
chair i saw everyth baa for thei pass just beneath my tree
then i came to seek you follow the outward spoor of the waggon
which i could not have done well at night that is all baa
han i said you have been drink and becaus of it the ladi
sadey is taken a prison by cannib for had you been awak and
watch you might have seen them come and save her and the rest
still afterward you did well and for the rest you must answer to
heaven
i must tell your reverend father the predik baa that the white
master redbeard gave me the liquor and it is rude not to do as a
great white master doe and drink it up i am sure he will understand
baa said han abjectli
i thought to myself that it wa true and that the spear which robertson
cast had fallen upon hi own head as the zulu sai but i made no
answer lack time for argument
did you sai ask umslopogaa speak for the first time that my
servant kill onli six of these meneat
han nod and answer ye six i count the bodi
it wa ill done thei should have kill six each said umslopogaa
moodili well thei have left the more for us to finish and he
finger the great ax
just then captain robertson arriv in hi waggon call out anxious
to know what wa the matter for some premonit of evil seem to have
struck him my heart sank at the sight of him for how wa i to tell
such a stori to the father of the murder children and of the abduct
girl
in the end i felt that i could not ye i turn coward and sai that
i must fetch someth out of the waggon bolt into it bid han
go forward and repeat hi tale he obei unwillingli enough and look
out between the curtain of the waggon tent i saw all that happen
though i could not hear the word that pass
robertson had halt the oxen and jump from the waggonbox strode
forward and met han who began to speak with him twitch hi hat in
hi hand gradual as the tale progress i saw the captain face
freez into a mask of horror then he began to argu and deni then to
weepoh it wa a terribl sight to see that great man weep over
those whom he had lost and in such a fashion
after thi a kind of blind rage seiz him and i thought he wa go
to kill han who wa of the same opinion for he ran awai next he
stagger about shake hi fist curs and shout till present
he fell of a heap and lai face downward beat hi head against the
ground and groan
now i went to him and sat up
that a pretti stori quatermain which thi littl yellow monkei ha
been gibber at me man do you understand what he sai he sai that
all those halfblood children of mine ar dead murder by savag from
over the zambesi ye and eaten too with their mother do you take
the point eaten like lamb those fire your man saw last night
were the fire on which thei were cook my littl soandso and
soandso and he mention half a dozen differ name ye
cook quatermain and that isnt all of it thei have taken inez too
thei didnt eat her but thei have drag her off a captiv for god
know what reason i couldnt understand the whole ship crew is gone
except the captain absent on leav and the first offic thomaso who
desert with some lascar stoker and left the women and children to
their fate my god im go mad im go mad if you have ani merci
in you give me someth to drink
all right i said i will sit here and wait a minut
then i went to the waggon and pour out a stiff tot of spirit into
which i put an amaz doze of bromid from a littl medicin chest i
alwai carri with me and thirti drop of chlorodyn on the top of it
all thi compound i mix up with a littl water and took it to him in a
tin cup so that he could not see the colour
he drank it at a gulp and throw the pannikin asid sat down on the
veld groan while the compani watch him at a respect distanc
for han had join the other and hi tale had spread like fire in
droughtparch grass
in a few minut the drug began to take effect upon robertson
tortur nerv for he rose and said quietli
what now
vengeanc or rather justic i answer
ye he exclaim vengeanc i swear that i will be aveng or
dieor both
again i saw my opportun and said you must swear more than that
robertson onli sober men can accomplish great thing for drink
destroi the judgment if you wish to be aveng for the dead and to
rescu the live you must be sober or i for on will not help you
will you help me if i do to the end good or ill quatermain he
ad
i nod
that as much as anoth oath he mutter still i will put my
thought in word i swear by god by my motherlik these nativesand
by my daughter born in honest marriag that i will never touch anoth
drop of strong drink until i have aveng those poor women and their
littl children and rescu inez from their murder if i do you mai
put a bullet through me
that all right i said in an offhand fashion though inwardli i
glow with pride at the success of my great idea for at the time i
thought it great and went on
now let us get to busi the first thing to do is to trek to
strathmuir and make prepar the next to start upon the trail come
to sit on the waggon with me and tell me what gun and ammunit you
have got for accord to han those savag dont seem to have touch
anyth except a few blanket and a herd of goat
he did as i ask tell me all he could rememb then he said
it is a strang thing but now i recal that about two year ago a
great savag with a high nose who talk a sort of arab which like
inez i understand have live on the coast turn up on dai and
said he want to trade i ask him what in and he answer that
he would like to bui some children i told him that i wa not a
slavedeal then he look at inez who wa move about and said
that he would like to bui her to be a wife for hi chief and offer
some fabul sum in ivori and in gold which he said should be paid
befor she wa taken awai i snatch hi big spear from hi hand broke
it over hi head and gave him the best hide with it shaft that he had
ever heard of then i kick him off the place he limp awai but when
he wa out of reach turn and call out that on dai he would come
again with other and take her mean inez without leav the price
in ivori and gold i ran for my gun but when i got back he had gone and
i never thought of the matter again from that dai to thi
well he kept hi promis i said but robertson made no answer for
by thi time that thunder dose of bromid and laudanum had taken
effect on him and he had fallen asleep of which i wa glad for i
thought that thi sleep would save hi saniti as i believ it did for a
while
we reach strathmuir toward sunset too late to think of attempt
the pursuit that dai inde dure our trek i had thought the matter
out carefulli and come to the conclus that to try to do so would be
useless we must rest and make prepar also there wa no hope of
our overtak these brute who alreadi had a clear twelv hour start
by a sudden spurt thei must be run down patient by follow their
spoor if inde thei could be run down at all befor thei vanish into
the vast recess of unknown africa the most we could do thi night wa
to get readi
captain robertson wa still sleep when we pass the villag and of
thi i wa heartili glad sinc the remain of a cannib feast ar not
pleasant to behold especi when thei ar inde of these i
determin to be rid at onc so slip off the waggon with han and
some of the farm boi for none of the zulu would defil themselv by
touch such human remnantsi made up two of the smoulder fire
the light of which the voorloop had seen upon the sky and on to
them cast or caus to be cast those poor fragment also i told the
farm nativ to dig a big grave and in it to place the other bodi and
gener to remov the trace of murder
then i went on to the hous and not too soon see the waggon arriv
and have made sure that the amahagg were gone thomaso and the other
coward emerg from their hidingplac and return unfortun for
the former the first person he met wa umslopogaa who began to revil
the fat halfbre in no measur term call him dog coward and
other opprobri name such as desert of women and children and so
forthal of which someon translat
thomaso an insol person tri to swagger the matter out sai
that he had gone to get assist infuri at thi lie umslopogaa
leapt upon him with a roar and though he wa a strong man dealt with
him as a lion doe with a buck lift him from hi feet he hurl him
to the ground then as he strove to rise and run caught him again and
as it seem to me wa about to break hi back across hi knee just at
thi junctur i arriv
let the man go i shout to him is there not enough death here
alreadi
ye answer umslopogaa i think there is best that thi jackal
should live to eat hi own shame and he cast thomaso to the ground
where he lai groan
robertson who wa still asleep in the waggon woke up at the nois and
descend from it look daze i got him to the hous and in do so
made my wai past or rather between the bodi of the two zulu and of
the six men whom thei had kill also of him whom inez had shot those
zulu had made a splendid fight for thei were cover with wound all
of them in front as i found upon examin
have made robertson lie down upon hi bed i took a good look at the
slain amahagg thei were magnific men all of them tall spare
and shape with veri clearcut featur and rather frizzl hair
from these characterist as well as the light of their colour
i conclud that thei were of a semit or arab type and that the
admixtur of their blood with that of the bantu wa but slight if
inde there were ani at all their spear of which on had been cut
through by a blow of a zulu ax were long and broad not unlik to
those us by the masai but of finer workmanship
by thi time the sun wa set and thoroughli tire by all that i had
gone through i went into the hous to get someth to eat have told
han to find food and prepar a meal as i sat down robertson join me
and i made him also eat hi first impuls wa to go to the cupboard and
fetch the spirit bottl inde he rose to do so
han is make coffe i said warningli
thank you he answer i forgot forc of habit you know
here i mai state that never from that moment did i see him touch anoth
drop of liquor not even when i drank my modest tot in front of him
hi triumph over temptat wa splendid and complet especi as the
absenc of hi accustom potat made him ill for some time and of
cours depress hi spirit with pain result that were appar in
due cours
in fact the man becam total chang he grew gloomi but resourc
also full of patienc onli on idea obsess himto rescu hi
daughter and aveng the murder of hi peopl inde except hi sin
he thought of and found interest in noth els moreov hi iron
constitut cast off all the effect of hi past debaucheri and he
grew so strong that although i wa pretti tough in those dai he could
outtir me
to return i engag him in convers and with hi help made a list
of what we should requir on our vendetta journei all of which serv
to occupi hi mind then i sent him to bed sai that i would call him
befor dawn have first put a littl more bromid into hi third cup
of coffe after thi i turn in and notwithstand the sight of those
remain of the cannib feast and the knowledg of the dead men who lai
outsid my window i slept like a top
inde it wa the captain who awaken me not i the captain sai
that daylight wa on the break and we had better be stir so we went
down to the store where i wa thank to find that everyth had been
tidi up in accord with my direct
on our wai robertson ask me what had becom of the remain whereon i
point to the smoulder ash of on of the great fire he went to
it and kneel down said a prayer in broad scotch doubtless on that
he had learn at hi mother knee then he took some of the ash from
the edg of the pyrefor such it wasand threw them into the glow
ember where as he knew lai all that wa left of those who had sprung
from him also he toss other of them into the air though what he
meant by thi i did not understand and never ask probabl it wa
some rite indic of expiat or of reveng or both which he had
learn from the savag among whom he had live so long
after thi we went into the store and with the help of some of
the nativ or halfbre who had accompani us on the seacow
expedit select all the good we want which we sent to the
hous
as we return thither i saw umslopogaa and hi men engag with the
usual zulu ceremoni in buri their two companion in a hole thei
had made in the hillsid i note howev that thei did not inter
their warax or their throwingspear with them as usual probabl
becaus thei thought that these might be need in place of them thei
put with the dead littl model roughli shape of bit of wood which
model thei kill by first break them across
i linger to watch the funer and heard goroko the witchdoctor make
a littl speech
o father and chief of the ax he said address umslopogaa who
stood silent lean on hi weapon and watch all a portent figur
in the morn mist o father o son of the heaven thi wa an
allus to the royal blood of umslopogaa of which the secret wa well
known although it would never have been spoken aloud in zululand o
slaughter bulalio o woodpeck who pick at the heart of men o
kingslay o conqueror of the halakazi o victor in a hundr fight
o gather of the lilybloom that fade in the hand o wolfman captain
of the wolv that raven o slayer of faku o great on whom it
pleas to seem small becaus he must follow hi blood to the end
appoint
thi wa the open of the speech the bonga or give of
titl of prais to the person address of which i have quot but a
sampl for there were mani more of them that i have forgotten then the
speaker went on
it wa told to me though of it i rememb noth that when my spirit
wa in me a while ago i prophesi that thi place would flow with
blood and lo the blood ha flow and with it that of these our
brother and he gave the name of the two dead zulu also those of
their forefath for sever gener
it seem father that thei di well as you would have wish them
to die and as doubtless thei desir to die themselv leav a tale
behind them though it is true that thei might have di better kill
more of the meneat as it is certain thei would have done had thei
not been sick insid thei ar finish thei have gone beyond to await
us in the underworld among the ghost their stori is told and soon to
their children thei will be but name whisper in honour after the sun
ha set enough of them who have show us how to die as our father did
befor them
goroko paus a while then ad with a wave of hi hand
my spirit come to me again and i know that these our brother shall
not pass unaveng chief of the ax great glori await the ax for it
shall feed full i have spoken
good word grunt umslopogaa then he salut the dead by rais
inkosikaa and came to me to consult about our journei
chapter viii
pursuit
after all we did not get awai much befor noon becaus first there wa
a great deal to be done to begin with the load had to be arrang
these consist larg of ammunit everyth els be cut down to
an irreduc minimum to carri them we took two donkei there were
on the place also half a dozen pack oxen all of which anim were
suppos to be saltedthat is to have suffer and recov from
everi kind of sick includ the bite of the deadli tsets fly
i suspect it is true that thei would not be proof against further
attack still i hope that thei would last for some time as inde
prove to be the case
in the event of the beast fail us we took also ten of the best
of those strathmuir men who had accompani us on the seacow trip to
serv as bearer when it becam necessari it cannot be said that these
snuffandbutt fellowsfor most if not all of them had some dash of
white blood in their veinswer exactli will volunt inde if
a choic had been left to them thei would i think have declin thi
adventur
but there wa no choic their master robertson order them to come
and after a glanc at the zulu thei conclud that the command wa on
which would be enforc and that if thei stop behind it would not
be as live men also some of them had lost wive or children in the
slaughter which if thei were not veri brave fill them with a desir
for reveng lastli thei could all shoot after a fashion and had good
rifl moreov if i mai sai so i think that thei put confid in my
leadership so thei made the best of a bad busi and got themselv
readi
then arrang must be made about the carri on of the farm and
store dure our absenc these togeth with my waggon and oxen were
put in the charg of thomaso sinc there wa no on els who could be
trust at alla veri batter and crestfallen thomaso by the wai
when he heard of it he wa much reliev sinc i think he fear lest
he also should be expect to take part in the hunt of the amahagg
maneat also it mai have occur to him that in all probabl
none of us would ever come back at all in which case by a process of
natur devolut he might find himself the owner of the busi and
much valuabl properti howev he swore by sundri saintsfor thomaso
wa nomin a catholicthat he would look after everyth as though
it were hi own as no doubt he hope it might becom
hearken fat pig said umslopogaa han obligingli translat so
that there might be no mistak if i come back and come back i shall
who travel with the great medicineand find even on of the cattl of
the white lord macumazahn watcherbynight miss or on articl
stolen from hi waggon or the field of your master not cultiv or
hi good wast i swear by the ax that i will hew you into piec
with the ax ye if to do it i have to hunt you from where the sun
rise to where it set and down the length of the night between do
you understand fat pig desert of women and children who to save
yourself could run faster than a buck
thomaso repli that he understood veri clearli inde and that heaven
help him all should be kept safe and sound still i wa sure that
in hi manli heart he wa promis great gift to the saint if thei
would so arrang matter that umslopogaa and hi ax were never seen at
strathmuir again and reflect that after all the amahagg had their
us howev as i did not trust him in the least much against their
will i left my driver and voorloop to guard my belong
at last we did get off pursu by the fervent bless of thomaso and
the prayer of the other that we would aveng their murder rel
we were a curiou and motlei process first went han becaus at
follow a spoor he wa i believ almost unequal in africa and
with him umslopogaa and three of hi zulu to guard against surpris
these were follow by captain robertson who seem to prefer to walk
alon and whom i thought it best to leav undisturb then i came
and after me straggl the strathmuir boi with the pack anim the
cavalcad be close by the remain zulu under the command of
goroko these walk last in case ani of the mixedblood should attempt
to desert as we thought it quit probabl that thei would
less than an hour tramp brought us to the bushveld where i fear
that our troubl might begin sinc if the amahagg were cun
thei would take advantag of it to confus or hide their spoor as it
chanc howev thei had done noth of the sort and a child could
have follow their march just befor nightfal we came to their first
haltingplac where thei had made a fire and eaten on of the herd of
farm goat which thei had driven awai with them although thei left the
cattl i suppos becaus goat ar docil and travel well
han show us everyth that had happen where the chair in which
inez wa carri wa set down where she and jane had been allow to
walk that she might stretch her stiff limb the dreg of some coffe
that evid jane had made in a saucepan and so forth
he even told us the exact number of the amahagg which he said
total fortyon includ the man whom inez had wound hi spoor
he distinguish from that of the other both by an occasion drop of
blood and becaus he walk lightli on hi right foot doubtless for
the reason that he wish to avoid jar hi wound which wa on that
side
at thi spot we were oblig to stai till daybreak sinc it wa
imposs to follow the spoor by night a circumst that gave the
cannib a great advantag over us
the next two dai were repetit of the first but on the fourth we
pass out of the bushveld into the swamp countri that border the
great river here our task wa still easi sinc the amahagg had
follow on of the path made by the riverdwel who had their
habit on mound though whether these were natur or artifici i
am not sure and sometim on float island
on our second dai in the reed we came upon a sad sight to our left
stood on of these mound villag if a villag it could be call
sinc it consist onli of four or five hut inhabit perhap by twenti
peopl we went up to it to obtain inform and stumbl across the
bodi of an old man ly in the pathwai a few yard further on we
found the ash of a big fire and by it such remain as we had seen at
strathmuir here there had been anoth cannib feast the miser
hut were empti but as at strathmuir had not been burnt
we were go awai when the acut ear of han caught the sound of
groan we search about and in a clump of reed near the foot of the
mound found an old woman with a great spear wound just abov her
skinni thigh pierc deep into the vital but of a natur which is
not immedi mortal on of robertson peopl who understood the
languag of these swampdwel well spoke to her she told him that
she want water it wa brought and she drank copious then in answer
to hi question she began to talk
she said that the amahagg had attack the villag and kill all who
could not escap thei had eaten a young woman and three children she
had been wound by a spear and fled awai into the place where we found
her where none of them took the troubl to follow her as she wa not
worth eat
by my direct the man ask her whether she knew anyth of these
amahagg she repli that her grandfath had though she had heard
noth of them sinc she wa a child which must have been seventi
year befor thei were a fierc peopl who live far up north across
the great river the remnant of a race that had onc rule the world
her grandfath us to sai that thei were not alwai cannib but
had becom so long befor becaus of a lack of food and now had acquir
the tast it wa for thi purpos that thei still raid to get
other peopl to eat sinc their ruler would not allow them to eat on
anoth the flesh of cattl thei did not care for although thei had
plenti of them but sometim thei at goat and pig becaus thei said
thei tast like man accord to her grandfath thei were a veri
evil peopl and full of magic
all of thi the old woman told us quit briskli after she had drunk the
water i think becaus her wound had mortifi and she felt no pain her
inform howev as is common with the ag dealt entir with
the far past of the histori of the amahagg sinc the dai of her
forebear she knew noth nor had she seen anyth of inez all she
could tell us wa that some of them had attack her villag at dawn and
that when she ran out of the hut she wa spear
while robertson and i were wonder what we should do with the poor old
creatur whom it seem cruel to leav here to perish she clear up
the question by suddenli expir befor our ey utter the name of
someon with whom doubtless she had been familiar in her youth three
or four time over she just sank down and seem to go to sleep and on
examin we found that she wa dead so we left her and went on
next dai we came to the edg of the great river here a sheet of placid
run water about a mile across for at thi time of the year it wa
low perceiv quit a big villag on our left we went to it and
made enquiri to find that it had not been attack by the cannib
probabl becaus it wa too power but that three night befor some
of their cano had been stolen in which no doubt these had cross the
river
as the peopl of thi villag had trade with robertson at strathmuir
we had no difficulti in obtain other cano from them in which to
cross the zambesi in return for on of our oxen that i could see wa
alreadi sicken from tsets bite these cano were larg enough to
take the donkei that were patient creatur and stood still but the
cattl we could not get into them for fear of an upset so we kill
the two driven beast that were left to us and took them with us as
dead meat for food while the three remain pack oxen we tri to swim
across drag them after the cano with hide reim round their
horn as a result two were drown but on a boldheart and
enterpris anim gain the other bank
here again we struck a sea of reed in which after cast about han
onc more found the spoor of the amahagg that it wa their beyond
doubt wa prove by the circumst that on a thorni kind of weed we
found a fragment of a cotton dress which becaus of the pattern stamp
on it we all recognis as on that inez had been wear at first i
thought that thi had been torn off by the thorn but on examin
we becam certain that it had been place there purpos probabl
by jane to give us a clue thi conclus wa confirm when at
subsequ period of the hunt we found other fragment of the same
garment
now it would be useless for me to set out the detail of thi prolong
and arduou chase which in all endur for someth over three week
again and again we lost the trail and were onli abl to recov it by
long and elabor search which occupi much time then after we
escap from the reed and swamp we found ourselv upon stoni
upland where the spoor wa almost imposs to follow inde we onli
rediscov it by stumbl across the dead bodi of that cannib whom
inez had wound evid he had perish from hi hurt which i could
see had mortifi from the state of hi remain we gather that the
raider must be about two dai march ahead of us
strike their spoor again on softer ground where the impress of their
feet remainedat ani rate to the cun sight of hansw follow
them down across great vallei wherein tree grew spars which
vallei were separ from each other by ridg of high and barren
land on these belt of rocki soil our difficulti were great but here
twice we were put on the right track by more fragment torn from the
dress of inez
at length we lost the spoor altogeth not a sign of it wa to be
found we had no idea which wai to go all about us appear these
vallei cover with scatter bush run thi wai and that so that
we could not tell which of them to follow or to cross the thing seem
hopeless for how could we expect to find a littl bodi of men in
that immens han shook hi head and even the fierc and steadfast
robertson wa discourag
i fear my poor lassi is gone he said and relaps into brood as
had becom hi wont
never sai die it dog as doe it i repli cheerfulli in the
word of nelson who also had learn what it meant to hunt an enemi
over trackless wast although hi were of water
i walk to the top of the rise where we were encamp and sat down
alon to think matter over our condit wa somewhat parlou all
our beast were now dead even the second donkei which wa the last of
them have perish that morn and been eaten for food wa scanti
sinc of late we had met with littl game the strathmuir men who now
must carri the load were almost worn out and doubtless would have
desert except for the fact that there wa no place to which thei
could go even the zulu were discourag and said thei had come
awai from home across the great river to fight not to run about in
wilder and starv though umslopogaa made no complaint be
buoi up by the promis of hi soothsay goroko that battl wa
ahead of him in which he would win great glori
han howev remain cheer for the reason as he remark
vacuous that the great medicin wa with us and that therefor
howev bad thing seem to be all in fact wa well an argument that
carri no convict to my soul
it wa on a certain even toward sunset that i went awai thu alon
i look about me east and west and north everywher appear the
same bushclad vallei and barren rise mile upon mile of them i
bethought me of the map that old zikali had drawn in the ash and
rememb that it show these vallei and rise and that beyond them
there should be a great swamp and beyond the swamp a mountain so it
seem that we were on the right road to the home of hi white queen
if such a person exist or at ani rate we were pass over countri
similar to that which he had pictur or imagin
but at thi time i wa not troubl my head about white queen i wa
think of poor inez that she wa aliv a few dai befor we knew from
the fragment of her dress but where wa she now the spoor wa utterli
lost on that stoni ground or if ani trace of it remain a heavi
delug of rain had wash them awai even han had confess himself
beaten
i stare about me helplessli and as i did so a fly rai of light
from the set sun reflect downward from a stormcloud fell upon a
white patch on the crest of on of the distant landwav it struck me
that probabl limeston outcrop at thi spot as inde prove to be
the case also that such a patch of white would be a conveni guid
for ani who were travel across that sea of bush further some
instinct within seem to impel me to steer for it although i had all
but made up my mind to go in a total differ direct mani more
point to the east it wa almost as though a voic were call to me
to take thi path and no other doubtless thi wa an effect produc
by weari and mental overstrain still there it wa veri real and
tangibl on that i did not attempt to combat
so next morn at the dawn i head north by west lai my cours for
that white patch and for the first time break the straight line of
our advanc captain robertson whose temper had not been better
by prolong and fright anxieti or i mai add by hi unaccustom
abstin ask me rather roughli why i wa alter the cours
look here captain i answer if we were at sea and you did
someth of the sort i should not put such a question to you and if
by ani chanc i did i should not expect you to answer well by your
own wish i am in command here and i think that the same argument hold
ye he repli i suppos you have studi your chart if there
is ani of thi godforsaken countri and at ani rate disciplin is
disciplin so steam ahead and dont mind me
the other accept my decis without comment most of them were so
miser that thei did not care which wai we went also thei were good
enough to repos confid in my judgment
doubtless the baa ha reason said han dubious although the
spoor when last we saw it head toward the rise sun and as the
countri is all the same i do not see why those maneat should have
return
ye i said i have reason although in fact i had none at all
han survei me with a wateri ey as though wait for me to explain
them but i look haughti and declin to oblig
the baa ha reason continu han for take us on what i think
to be the wrong side of that great ridg there to hunt for the spoor of
the meneat and thei ar so deep down in hi mind that he cannot
dig them up for poor old han to look at well the baa wear the great
medicin and perhap it is there that the reason sit those strathmuir
fellow sai that thei can go no further and wish to die umslopogaa
ha just gone to them with hi ax to tell them that he is readi to help
them to their wish look he ha got there for thei ar come quickli
who after all prefer to live
well we start for my white patch of stone which no on els had
notic and of which i said noth to anyon and reach it by the
follow even to find as i expect that it wa a lime outcrop
by now we were in a poor wai for we had practic noth left to
eat which did not tend to rais the spirit of the parti also that
lime outcrop prove to be an uninterest spot overlook a wide
vallei which seem to suggest that there were other vallei of a
similar sort beyond it and noth more
captain robertson sat sternfac and despond at a distanc mutter
into hi beard as had becom a habit with him umslopogaa lean upon
hi ax and contempl the heaven also occasion the strathmuir
men who cower beneath hi ey the zulu squat about share such
snuff as remain to them in econom pinch goroko the witchdoctor
engag himself in consult hi spirit by mean of bonethrow
upon the humbl subject of whether or no we should succe in kill
ani game for food tomorrow a point on which i gather that hi
spirit wa quit uncertain in short the gloom wa deep and univers
and the sky look as though it were go to rain
han becam sarcast sneak up to me in hi most aggrav wai
like a dog that mean to steal someth and cover up the theft with
simul affect he point out on by on all the disadvantag of
our present posit he indic per contra that if hi advic
had been follow hi convict wa that even if we had not found the
maneat and rescu the ladi call sadey our state would have
been quit differ he wa sure he ad that the vallei which he
had suggest we should follow wa on full of game inasmuch as he had
seen their spoor at it entranc
then why did you not sai so i ask
han suck at hi empti corncob pipe which wa hi wai of indic
that he would like me to give him some tobacco much as a dog groan
heavili under the tabl when he want a bit to eat and answer that it
wa not for him to point out thing to on who knew everyth like the
great macumazahn watcherbynight hi honour master still the luck
did seem to have gone a bit wrong the privat could have been put up
with here he suck veri loudli at the empti pipe and look at mine
which wa alight everyth could have been put up with if onli there
had been a chanc of come even with those meneat and rescu the
ladi sadey whose face haunt hi sleep as it wa howev he
wa convinc that by follow the cours i had map out we had lost
their spoor final and that probabl thei were now three dai march
awai in anoth direct still the baa had said that he had hi
reason and that of cours wa enough for him han onli if the baa
would condescend to tell him he would as a matter of curios like to
know what the reason were
at that moment i confess that much as i wa attach to him i should
have like to murder han who i felt believ that he had me on
toast to us a vulgar phrase wa take advantag of my posit to
make a mock of me in hi sly hottentot wai
i tri to continu to look grand but felt that the attitud did
not impress then i stare about me as though take counsel with the
heaven devoutli hope that the heaven would respond to my mute
appeal as a matter of fact thei did
there is my reason han i said in my most ici voic and i point
to a faint line of smoke rise against the twilight sky on the further
side of the interven vallei
you will perceiv han i ad that those amahagg cannib have
forgotten their caution and lit a fire yonder which thei have not done
for a long time perhap you would like to know why thi ha happen
if so i will tell you it is becaus for some dai past i have purpos
lost their spoor which thei knew we were follow and lit fire to
puzzl them now think that thei have done with us thei have becom
incauti and shown us where thei ar that is my reason han
he heard and although of cours he did not believ that i had lost the
spoor on purpos stare at me till i thought hi littl ey were go
to drop out of hi head but even in hi admir he contriv to
convei an insult as onli a nativ can
how wonder is the great medicin of the openerofroad that it
should have been abl thu to instruct the baa he said without
doubt the great medicin is right and yonder those meneat ar
encamp who might just as well as have been anywher els within a
hundr mile
drat the great medicin i repli but beneath my breath then ad
aloud
be so good han as to go to umslopogaa and to tell him that
macumazahn or the great medicin propos to march at onc to attack
the camp of the amahagg andher is some tobacco
ye baa answer han humbl as he snatch the tobacco and
wriggl awai like a worm
then i went to talk with robertson
the end of it wa that within an hour we were creep across that
vallei toward the spot where i had seen the line of smoke rise
against the twilight sky
somewher about midnight we reach the neighbourhood of thi place how
near or how far we were from it we could not tell sinc the moon wa
invis as of cours the smoke wa in the dark now the question wa
what should we do
obvious there would be enorm advantag in a night attack or at
least in locat the enemi so that it might be carri out at dawn
befor he march especi wa thi so sinc we were scarc in a
condit even if we could come face to face with them to fight these
savag when thei were prepar and in the light of dai onli we two
white men with han umslopogaa and hi zulu could be reli upon
in such a case sinc the strathmuir mixedblood had becom entir
demoralis and were not to be trust at a pinch inde tire and
half starv as we were none of us wa at hi best therefor a
surpris seem our onli chanc but first we must find those whom we
wish to surpris
ultim after a hurri consult it wa agre that han and
i should go forward and see if we could locat the amahagg robertson
wish to come too but i point out that he must remain to look after
hi peopl who if he left them might take the opportun to melt
awai in the dark especi as thei knew that heavi fight wa
at hand also if anyth happen to me it wa desir that on white
man should remain to lead the parti umslopogaa too volunt but
know hi charact i declin hi help to tell the truth i wa
almost certain that if we came upon the meneat he would charg the
whole lot of them and accomplish a fine but futil end after hack
down a number of cannib barbarian whose extinct or escap
remain absolut immateri to our purpos name the rescu of
inez
so it came about that han and i start alon i not at all enjoi
the job i suppos that there lurk in my natur some of that primev
terror of the dark which must continu have haunt our remot
forefath of a hundr or a thousand gener gone and still
linger in the blood of most of us at ani rate even if i am name the
watcherbynight greatli do i prefer to fight or to face peril in the
sunlight though it is true that i would rather avoid both at ani time
in fact i wish heartili that the amahagg were at the other side
of africa or in heaven and that i complet ignor of the person
call inez robertson were seat smoke the pipe of peac on my own
stoep in durban i think that han guess my state of mind sinc
he suggest that he should go alon ad with hi usual unveil
rude that he wa quit certain that he would do much better without
me sinc white men alwai made a nois
ye i repli determin to give him a roland for hi oliv i
have no doubt you wouldund the first bush you came across where you
would sleep till dawn and then return and sai that you could not find
the amahagg
han chuckl quit appreci the joke and have thu mutual
affront each other we start on our quest
chapter ix
the swamp
neither han nor i carri rifl that we knew would be in the wai on
our busi which wa just to scout moreov on is alwai tempt
to shoot if a gun is at hand and thi i did not want to do at present
so although i had my revolv in case of urgent necess my onli
other weapon wa a zulu ax that formerli had belong to on of those
two men who di defend inez on the veranda at strathmuir while han
had noth but hi long knife thu arm or unarm we crept forward
toward that spot whenc as we conjectur we had seen the line of
smoke rise some hour befor
for about a quarter of a mile we went on thu without see or hear
anyth and a difficult job it wa in that gloom among the scatter
tree with no light save such as the star gave us inde i wa about
to suggest that we had better abandon the enterpris until daybreak when
han nudg me whisper
look to the right between those twin thorn
i obei and follow the line of sight which he had indic
perceiv at a distanc of about two hundr yard a faint glow so
faint inde that i think onli han would have notic it realli it
might have been noth more than the phosphoresc rise from a heap
of fungu or even from a decai anim
the fire of which we saw the smoke that ha burnt to ash whisper
han again i think that thei have gone but let us look
so we crawl forward veri cautious to avoid make the slightest
nois so cautious inde that it must have taken us nearli half an
hour to cover those two hundr yard
at length we were within about forti yard of that dy fire and
afraid to go further came to a standor rather a liestillbehind
some bush until we knew more han lift hi head and snif with
hi broad nostril then he whisper into my ear but so low that i
could scarc hear him
amahagg there all right baa i smell them
thi of cours wa possibl sinc what wind there wa blew from the
direct of the fire although i whose nose is fairli keen could smell
noth at all so i determin to wait and watch a while and indic
my decis to han who consid our purpos accomplish show
sign of wish to retreat
some minut we lai thu till of a sudden thi happen a branch of
resin wood of which the stem had been eaten through by the flame
fell upon the ash of the fire and burnt up with a brilliant light in
it we saw that the amahagg were sleep in a circl round the fire
wrap in their blanket
also we saw anoth thing name that nearer to us not more than a
dozen yard awai inde wa a kind of littl tent also made of fur
rug or blanket which doubtless shelter inez inde thi wa
evid from the fact that at the mouth of it wrap up in someth
lai none other than her maid jane for her face be toward us wa
recognis by us both in the flare of the flame branch on more thing
we note name that two of the cannib evid a guard were
sleep between us and the littl tent of cours thei ought to have
been awak but fatigu had overcom them and there thei slumber
seat on the ground their head hang forward almost upon their
knee
an idea came to me if we could kill those men without wake the other
in that gloom it might be possibl to rescu inez at onc rapidli i
weigh the pro and con of such an attempt it advantag if
success were that the object of our pursuit would be carri through
without further troubl and that it wa most doubt whether we should
ever get such a chanc again if we return to fetch the other and
attack in forc the probabl wa that those amahagg or on of
them would hear some sound made by the advanc of a number of men and
fly into the dark or rather than lose inez thei might kill her
or if thei stood and fought she might be slain in the scrimmag or
as after all we had onli about a dozen effect for the strathmuir
bearer could not be reli upon thei might defeat and kill us whom
thei outnumb by two or three to on
these were the argument for the attempt those for not make it were
equal obviou to begin with it wa on of extraordinari risk the two
guard or someon els behind them might wake upfor such peopl like
dog mostli sleep with on ey open especi when thei knew that
thei ar be pursu or if thei did not we might bungl the busi
so that thei rais an outcri befor thei grew silent for ever in which
case both of us and perhap inez also would probabl pai the penalti
befor we could get awai
such wa the horn dilemma upon on point or other of which we ran the
risk of be impal for a full minut or more i consid the matter
with an earnest almost amount to mental agoni and at last all
but came to the conclus that the danger wa too enorm it would be
better notwithstand the mani disadvantag of that plan to go back
and fetch the other
but then it wa that i made on of my mani mistak in life most of
us do more foolish thing than wise on and sometim i think that
in spite of a certain reput for caution and farsighted i am
exception curs in thi respect inde when i look back upon my
past i can scarc see the scanti flower of wisdom that decor
it path becaus of the fat ugli tree of error by which it is
overshadow
on that occas forget past experi where han wa concern
my natur tendenc to blunder took the form of reli upon anoth
judgment instead of on my own although i had form a certain view as
to what should be done the pro and con seem so evenli balanc
that i determin to consult the littl hottentot and accept hi
verdict thi after all wa but a form of gambl like pitch and
toss sinc although it is true han wa a clever or at ani rate a
cun man accord to hi light and experienc it meant that
i wa place my own judgment in abey which no on consid
a lifeanddeath enterpris should do take the chanc of that of
anoth whatev it might be howev not for the first time i did
soto my grief
in the tiniest of whisper with my lip right against hi smelli head i
submit the problem to han ask him what we should do go on or go
back he consid a while then answer in a voic which he contriv
to make like the drone of a night beetl
those men ar fast asleep i know it by their breath also the baa
ha the great medicin therefor i sai go on kill them and rescu
sadey
now i saw that the fate to which i had appeal had decid against me
and that i must accept their decre with a sick and sink heartfor
i did not at all like the businessi wonder for a moment what had
led han to take thi view which wa directli opposit to ani i had
expect from him of cours hi superstit about the great medicin
had someth to do with it but i felt convinc that thi wa not all
even then i guess that two argument appeal to him of which
the first wa that he desir if possibl to put an end to thi
intoler and unceas hunt which had worn us all out no matter
what that end might be the second and more power howev wa i
believ and rightli that the idea of thi stealthi midnight blow
appeal irresist to the craft of hi halfwild natur in which the
strain of the leopard and the snake seem to mingl with that of the
human be for be it rememb that notwithstand hi veneer of
civilis han wa a savag whose forefath for countless ag had
preserv themselv aliv by mean of such attack and stratagem
the die have been cast in the same infinitesim whisper we made our
arrang which were few and simpl thei amount to thisthat
we were to creep on to the men and each of us to kill that on who wa
opposit to him i with the ax and han with hi knife rememb
that it must be done with a singl strokethat is if thei did not
wake up and kill usaft which we were to get inez out of her shelter
dress or undress and make off with her into the dark where we
were pretti sure of be abl to baffl pursuit until we reach our
own camp
provid that we could kill the two guard in the proper fashionrath
a larg proviso i admitth thing wa simpl as shell pea which
notwithstand the proverb in my experi is not simpl at all
sinc gener the shell crack the wrong wai and at least on of the
pea remain in the pod so it happen in thi case for jane whom
we had both forgotten remain in the pod
i am sure i dont know why we overlook her inde the error wa
inexcus especi as han had alreadi experienc her foolish
and she wa ly there befor our ey i suppos that our mind were
so concentr upon the guardkil and the tragic and impress
inez that there wa no room in them for the stolid and matteroffact
jane at ani rate she prove to be the pea that would not come out of
the pod
often in my life i have felt terrifi not be by natur on of those
who rejoic in danger and wild adventur for their own sake which
onli the stupid do but who ha on the contrari been forc to
undertak them by the pressur of circumst a kind of hydraul
forc that no on can resist and who have undertaken ha been
carri through them triumph over the shrink of hi flesh by
some secret reserv of nerv power almost am i tempt to call it
spiritpow someth that live beyond and yet inspir our frail and
fallibl bodi
well rare have i been more frighten than i wa at thi moment
actual i hung back until i saw that han slither through the grass
like a thick yellow snake with the great knife in hi right hand
wa quit a foot ahead of me then my pride came to the rescu and i
spurt if on can spurt upon on stomach and drew level with him
after thi we went at a pace so slow that ani ablebodi snail would
have left us stand still inch by inch we crept forward ly
motionless a while after each convuls movement onc for quit a
long time sinc the lefthand cannib seem about to wake up for he
open hi mouth and yawn if so he chang hi mind and roll from
a sit postur on to hi side went to sleep much more soundli than
befor
a minut or so later the righthand ruffian my man also stir so
sharpli that i thought he had heard someth appar howev he
wa onli haunt by dream result from an evil life or perhap
by the prescienc of it end for after wave hi arm and mutter
someth in a frighten voic he too weari out poor devil sank
back into sleep
at last we were on them but paus becaus we could not see exactli
where to strike and knew each of us that our first blow must be the
last and fatal a cloud had come up and dim what light there wa and
we must wait for it to pass it wa a long wait or so it seem
at length that cloud did pass and in faint outlin i saw the classic
head of my amahagg bow in deep sleep with a heart beat as it
doe onli in the fierc extrem of love or war i hiss like a
snake which wa our agre signal then rise to my knee i lift
the zulu ax and struck with all my strength
the blow wa straight and true umslopogaa himself could not have
dealt a better the victim in front of me utter no sound and made
no movement onli sank gentli on to hi side and there lai as dead as
though he had never been born
it appear that han had done equal well sinc the other man kick
out hi long leg which struck me on the knee then he also becam
strang still in short both of them were stone dead and would tell
no stori thi side of judgment dai
recov my ax which had been wrench from my hand i crept forward
and open the curtainlik rug or blanket i do not know which thei
were that cover inez i heard her stir at onc the movement had
waken her sinc captiv sleep lightli
make no nois inez i whisper it is i allan quatermain come to
rescu you slip out and follow me do you understand
ye quit she whisper back and began to rise
at thi moment a bloodcurdl yell seem to fill earth and heaven a
yell at the memori of which even now i feel faint although i am write
year after it echo di awai
i mai as well sai at onc that it came from jane who awak suddenli
had perceiv against the background of the sky han stand over her
look like a yellow devil with a long knife in hi hand which she
thought wa about to be us to murder her
so lack selfrestraint she scream in the most lusti fashion for
her lung were excel andth game wa up
instantli everi man sleep round the fire leapt to hi feet and rush
in the direct of the echo of jane yell it wa imposs to get
inez free of her tent arrang or to do anyth except whisper to
her
feign sleep and know noth we will follow you your father is with
us
then i bolt back into the bush which han had reach alreadi
a minut or two later when we were clear of the hubbub and near our
own camp han remark to me sententi
the great medicin work well baa but not quit well enough for
what medicin can avail against a woman folli
it wa our own folli we should blame i answer we ought to have
known that foolgirl would shriek and taken precaut
ye baa we ought to have kill her too for noth els would have
kept her quiet repli han in cheer assent now we shall have to
pai for our mistak for the hunt must go on
at thi moment we stumbl across robertson and umslopogaa who with
the other and everi live thing within a mile or two had also heard
jane yell and briefli told our stori when he learn how near we
had been to rescu hi daughter robertson groan but umslopogaa
onli said
well there ar two less of the meneat left to deal with still
for onc your wisdom fail you macumazahn when you had found the camp
you should have return so that we might all attack it togeth had
we done so befor the dawn there would not have been on of them left
ye i answer i think that my wisdom did fail me if i have ani to
fail but come perhap we mai catch them yet
so we advanc han and i show the road but when we reach the
place it wa too late for all that remain of the amahagg or of
inez and jane were the two dead men whom we had kill and in that
dark pursuit wa imposs so we went back to our own camp to rest
and await the dawn befor take up the trail onli to find ourselv
confront with a new troubl all the strathmuir halfbre whom we
had left behind as useless had taken advantag of our absenc and that
of the zulu to desert thei had just bolt back upon our track and
vanish into the sea of bush what becam of them i do not know as we
never saw them again but my belief is that these cowardli fellow all
perish for certainli not on of them reach strathmuir
fortun for us howev thei depart in such a hurri that thei
left all their load behind them and even some of the gun thei
carri evid jane yell wa the last straw which broke the back
of such nerv as remain to them doubtless thei believ it to be the
signal of attack by hord of cannib
as there wa noth to said or done sinc ani pursuit of these cur
wa out of the question we made the best of thing as thei were it
prove a simpl busi from the load we select such articl as
were essenti ammunit for the most part to carri ourselvesand
the rest we abandon hide it under a pile of stone in case we
should ever come that wai again
the gun thei had thrown asid we distribut among the zulu who had
none though the thought that thei possess them so far as i wa
concern ad anoth terror to life the prospect of go into
battl with those wild axemen let off bullet in everi direct wa
not pleasant but fortun when that crisi came thei cast them awai
and revert to the weapon to which thei were accustom
now all thi sound much like a tale of disast or at ani rate of
failur it is howev wonder by what strang wai good result
ar brought about so much so that at time i think that these seem
accid must be arrang by an intellig superior to our own to
fulfil through us purpos of which we know noth and frequent
be it admit of a natur suffici obscur of cours thi is a
fatalist doctrin but then as i have said befor within certain
limit i am a fatalist
to take the present case for instanc the whole inez episod at first
sight might appear to be an excresc on my narr of which the
object is to describ how i met a certain veri wonder woman and what
i heard and experienc in her compani yet it is not realli so sinc
had it not been for the inez adventur it is quit clear that i should
never have reach the home of thi woman if woman she were or have
seen her at all befor long thi becam veri obviou to me as shall be
told
from the night upon which han and i fail to rescu inez we had
no more difficulti in follow the trail of the cannib who
thenceforward were never more than a few hour ahead of us and had no
time to be care or to attempt to hide their spoor yet so fast did
thei travel that do what we would burden and weari as we were it
prove imposs to overtak them
for the first three dai the track ran on through scatter roll
bushveld of the charact that i have describ but tend
continu down hill when we broke camp on the morn of the fourth
dai eat a hasti meal at dawn for now game had becom astonishingli
plenti so that we did not lack food the rise sun show beneath
us an endless sea of billowi mist stretch in everi direct far as
the sight could carri
to the north howev it did come to an end for there as i judg
fifti or sixti mile awai rose the grim outlin of what look like a
huge fortress which i knew must be on of those extraordinari mountain
format probabl ow their origin to volcan action that ar to
be met with here and there in the vast expans of central and eastern
africa be so distant it wa imposs to estim it size which
i guess must be enorm but in look at it i bethought me of that
great mountain in which zikali said the marvel white queen live
and wonder whether it could be the same as from my memori of hi map
upon the ash it well might be that is if such a place exist
at all if so the map had shown it as surround by swamp andwel
sure that mist hid the face of a mighti swamp
it did inde sinc befor nightfal follow the spoor of those
amahagg we had plung into a morass so vast that in all my
experi i have never seen or heard of it like it wa a verit
ocean of papyru and other reed some of them a dozen or more feet
high so that it wa imposs to see a yard in ani direct
here it wa that the amahagg ahead of us prove our salvat sinc
without them to guid us we must soon have perish for through that
gigant swamp there ran a road as i think an ancient road sinc in
on or two place i saw stone work which must have been laid by man yet
it wa not a road which it would have been possibl to follow without
a guid see that it also wa overgrown with reed inde the onli
differ between it and the surround swamp wa that on the road
the soil wa compar firm that is to sai on seldom sank into
it abov the knee wherea on either side of it quagmir were often
appar bottomless and what is more partook of the natur of
quicksand
thi we found out soon after we enter the swamp sinc robertson
push forward with the fierc eager which seem to consum him
neglect to keep hi ey upon the spoor and step off the edg on to
land that appear to be exactli similar to it surfac instantli he
began to sink in greasi and tenaci mud umslopogaa and i were onli
twenti yard behind yet by the time we reach him in answer to hi
shout alreadi he wa engulf up to hi middl and go down so
rapidli that in anoth minut he would have vanish altogeth well
we got him out but not with eas for that mud clung to him like the
tentacl of an octopu after thi we were more care
nor did thi road run straight on the contrari it curv about and
sometim turn at right angl doubtless to avoid a piec of swamp
over which it had prove imposs for the ancient to construct a
causewai or to follow some outcrop of harder soil beneath
the difficulti of that horribl place ar beyond descript and
inde can scarc be imagin first there wa that of a kind of grass
which grew among the root of the reed and had edg like to those of
knive as robertson and i wore gaiter we did not suffer so much from
it but the poor zulu with their bare leg were terribl cut about and
in some case lame
then there were the mosquito which live here by the million and all
seem anxiou for a bite also snake of a peculiarli deadli kind were
numer a zulu wa bitten by on of them of so poison a natur that
he di within three minut for the venom seem to go straight to hi
heart we threw hi bodi into the swamp where it vanish at onc
lastli there wa the allpervad stench and the intoler heat of
the place sinc no breath of air could penetr that forest of
reed while a minor troubl wa that of the multitud of leech
which fasten on to our bodi by look on could see the creatur
sit on the under side of leav with their head stretch out
wait to attack anyth that went by as wayfar there could not
have been numer i wonder what thei had live on for the last few
thousand year by the wai i found that paraffin of which we had a
small suppli for our handlamp rub over all expos surfac wa
to some extent a protect against these bloodsuck worm and the
gnat although it did make on go about smell like a dirti oil tin
dure the dai except for the occasion rush of some great iguana
or other reptil and the sound of the wing of the flock of wildfowl
pass over us from time to time the march wa deathli silent but at
night it wa differ for then the bullfrog boom incessantli as
did the bittern while great swamp owl and other nightfli bird
utter their weird cri also there were mysteri suck nois
caus no doubt by the sink of area of swamp with those of
burst bubbl of foul uprush ga
strang light too plai about willothewisp or st elmo fire
as i believ thei ar call that frighten the zulu veri much sinc
thei believ them to be spirit of the dead perhap thi superstit
had someth to do with their nativ legend that mankind wa torn out
of the reed if so thei mai have imagin that the ghost of men went
back to the reed of which there were enough here to accommod those
of the entir zulu nation ani wai thei were much scare even the bold
witchdoctor goroko wa scare and went through incant with the
littl bag of medicin he carri to secur protect for himself and
hi companion inde i think even the iron umslopogaa himself wa
not as comfort as he might have been although he did inform me that
he had come out to fight and did not care whether it were with man or
wizard or spirit
in short of all the journei that i have made with the except of
the passag of the desert on our wai to king solomon mine i think
that through thi enorm swamp wa the most miser heartili did i
curs myself for ever have undertaken such a quest in a wild attempt
to allai that sick or rather to quench that thirst of the soul
which i imagin at time assail most of those who have heart and
think or dream
for thi wa at the bottom of the busi thi it wa which had
deliv me into the hand of zikali openerofroad who as now i
am sure wa mere make us of me for hi privat occult purpos he
desir to consult the distant oracl if such a person exist as to
great scheme of hi own and therefor to attain hi end made us
of my secret long which i had been so foolish as to reveal to him
quit careless of what happen to me in the process a bit narrow and
uncharit thi view it seem to me that zikali is take a big risk
in give him the great medicinejb
well i wa in for the busi and must follow it to the finish
whatev that might be after all it wa veri interest and if
there were anyth in what zikali said if there were not i could not
conceiv what object he had in send me on such a wildgoos chase
through thi home of gees and duck it might becom more interest
still for be pretti well feverproof i did not think i should die
in that morass as of cours nine white men out of ten would have done
and beyond it lai the huge mountain which dai by dai grew larger and
clearer
nor did han who with a childlik trust pin hi faith to the great
medicin thi he remark wa the worst veld through which he had
ever travel but as the great medicin would never consent to be
buri in that stink mud he had no doubt that we should come safe
through it some time i repli that thi wonder medicin of hi had
not save on of our companion who had now made a grave in the same
mud
no baa he said but those zulu have noth to do with the
medicin which wa given to you and to me who accompani you when we
saw the openerofroad therefor perhap thei will all die except
umslopogaa whom you were told to take with you if so what doe
it matter sinc there ar plenti of zulu although there be but on
macumazahn or on han also the baa mai rememb that he began by
offend a snake and therefor it is quit natur that thi snake
brother should have bitten the zulu
if you ar right he should have bitten me han
ye baa and so no doubt he would have done had you not been
protect by the great medicin and me too had not my grandfath been
a snakecharm to sai noth of the smell of the medicin be on me
as well the snake know those that thei should bite baa
so do the mosquito i answer grab a hand of them the
great medicin ha no effect upon them
oh ye baa it ha sinc though it pleas them to bite the bite
do us no harm or at least not much and all ar made happi still
i wish we could get out of these reed of which i never want to see
anoth and baa pleas keep your rifl readi for i think i hear a
crocodil stir there
no need han i remark sarcast go and tell him that i have
the great medicin
ye baa i will also that if he is veri hungri there ar some zulu
camp a few yard further down the road and he went solemnli to the
reed a littl wai off and began to talk to them
you infern donkei i murmur and drew my blanket over my head in
a vain attempt to keep out the mosquito and smoke furious with the
same object tri to get to sleep
at last the swamp bottom began to slope upward a littl with the
result that as the land dri through natur drainag the reed grew
thinner by degre until final thei ceas and we found ourselv on
firmer ground inde upon the lowest slope of the great mountain that
i have mention that now tower abov us forbidden and majest
i had made a littl map in my pocketbook of the variou twist and
turn of the road through that vast slough of despond mark them from
hour to hour as we follow it deviou wander on studi thi
at the end of that part of our journei i realis afresh how utterli
imposs it would have been for us to thread that misti maze where a
few fals step would alwai have meant death by suffoc had it not
been for the spoor of those amahagg travel immedi ahead of us
who were acquaint with it secret had thei been friendli guid thei
could not have done us a better turn
what i wonder wa why thei had not tri to ambush us in the reed
sinc our fire must have shown them that we were close upon their
heel that thei did try to burn us out wa clear from certain evid
that i found but fortun at thi season of the year in the absenc
of a strong wind the rank reed were too green to catch fire for the
rest i wa soon to learn the reason of their neglect to attack us in
that dens cover
thei were wait for a better opportun
chapter x
the attack
we won out of the reed at last for which i fervent thank god
sinc to have cross that endless marsh unguid with the loss of onli
on man seem littl less than miracul we emerg from them late
in the afternoon and be weari out stop for a while to rest and
eat of the flesh of a buck that i had been fortun enough to shoot
upon their fring then we push forward up the slope propos to
camp for the night on the crest of it a mile or so awai where i thought
we should escap from the deadli mist in which we had been envelop for
so long and obtain a clear view of the countri ahead
follow the bank of a stream which here ran down into the marsh we
came at length to thi crest just as the sun wa sink below us lai
a deep vallei a fold as it were in the skin of the mountain well
but not dens bush the wood of thi vallei climb up the mountain
flank for some distanc abov it and then gave wai to grassi slope that
end in steep side of rock which were crown by a black and frown
precipic of unknown height
there wa i rememb someth veri impress about thi tower
natur wall which seem to shut off whatev lai beyond the gaze of
man as though it veil an ancient mysteri inde the aspect of it
thrill me i knew not why i observ howev that at on point in
the mighti cliff there seem to be a narrow cleft down which no doubt
lava had flow in a remot ag and it occur to me that up thi
cleft ran a roadwai probabl a continu of that by which we had
thread the swamp the fact that through my glass i could see herd
of cattl graze on the slope of the mountain went to confirm thi
view sinc cattl impli owner and herdsmen and search as i would i
could find no nativ villag on the slope the infer seem to be
that those owner dwelt beyond or within the mountain
all of these thing i saw and point out to robertson in the light of
the set sun
meanwhil umslopogaa had been engag in select the spot where we
were to camp for the night some soldierlik instinct or perchanc some
prescienc of danger caus him to choos a place particularli suitabl
to defenc it wa on a steepsid mound that more or less resembl a
gigant antheap upon on side thi mound wa protect by the stream
which becaus of a pool wa here rather deep while at the back of it
stood a collect of those curiou and piledup waterworn rock that
ar often to be found in africa these rock ly on upon anoth
like the stone of a cyclopean wall curv round the western side of
the mound so that practic it wa onli open for a narrow space
sai thirti or forti feet upon that face of it which look on to the
mountain
umslopogaa expect battl remark han to me with a grin
otherwis with all thi nice plain round us he would not have chosen to
camp in a place which a few men could hold against mani ye baa he
think that those cannib ar go to attack us
stranger thing have happen i answer indiffer and have
seen to the rifl went to lie down observ as i did so that the
tire zulu seem alreadi to be asleep onli umslopogaa did not sleep
on the contrari he stood lean on hi ax stare at the dim outlin
of the oppos precipic
a strang mountain macumazahn he said compar to it that of the
witch beneath which my kraal li is but a littl babi i wonder what
we shall find within it i have alwai love mountain macumazahn ever
sinc a dead brother of mine and i live with the wolv in the witch
lap for on them i have had the best of my fight
perhap it is not done with yet i answer wearili
i hope not macumazahn sinc some is due for us after all these dai
of mud and stench sleep a while now macumazahn for that head of your
which you us so much must need rest fear not i and the littl yellow
man who do not think as much as you do will keep watch and wake you if
there is need as mayhap there will be befor the dawn here none can
come at us except in front and the place is narrow
so i lai down and slept as soundli as ever i had done in my life for a
space of four or five hour i suppos then by some instinct perhap i
awok suddenli feel much refresh in that sweet mountain air a new
man inde and in the moonlight saw umslopogaa stride toward me
aris macumazahn he said i hear men stir below us
at thi moment han slip past him whisper
the cannib ar come baa a good number of them i think thei
mean to attack befor dawn
then he pass behind me to warn the zulu as he went by i said to
him
if so han now is the time for your great medicin to show what it
can do
the great medicin will look after you and me all right baa he
repli paus and speak in dutch which umslopogaa did not
understand but i expect there will be fewer of those zulu to cook for
befor the sun grow hot their spirit will be turn into snake and
go back into the reed from which thei sai thei were torn out he
ad over hi shoulder
i should explain that han act as cook to our parti and it wa a
grievanc with him that the zulu at so much of the meat which he wa
call upon to prepar inde there is never much sympathi between
hottentot and zulu
what is the littl yellow man sai about us ask umslopogaa
suspici
he is sai that if it come to battl you and your men will make a
great fight i repli diplomat
ye we will do that macumazahn but i thought he said that we should
be kill and that thi pleas him
oh dear no i answer hastili how could he be pleas if that
happen sinc then he would be left defenceless if he were not kill
too now umslopogaa let us make a plan for thi fight
so togeth with robertson rapidli we discuss the thing as a
result with the help of the zulu we drag togeth some loos
stone and the top of three small thorn tree which we had cut
down and with them made a low breastwork suffici to give us some
protect if we lai down to shoot it wa the work of a few minut
sinc we had prepar the materi when we camp in case an emerg
should aris
behind thi breastwork we gather and wait robertson and i be
care to get a littl to the rear of the zulu who it will be
rememb had the rifl which the strathmuir bastard had left behind
them when thei bolt in addit to their ax and throw assegai
the question wa how these cannib would fight i knew that thei were
arm with long spear and knive but i did not know if thei us those
spear for thrust or for throw in the former case it would be
difficult to get at them with the ax becaus thei must have the longer
reach fortun as it turn out thei did both
at length all wa readi and there came that long and try wait the
most disagre part of a fight in which on grow nervou and begin
to reflect earnestli upon on sin clearli the amahagg if thei
realli intend busi did not mean to attack till just befor dawn
after the common nativ fashion think to rush us in the low and
puzzl light what perplex me wa that thei should wish to attack
us at all after have let so mani opportun of do so go by
appar these men were now in sight of their own home where no doubt
thei had mani friend and by push on could reach it shelter befor
us especi as thei knew the road and we did not
thei had come out for a secret purpos that seem to have to do with
the abduct of a certain young white woman for reason connect
with their tribal statecraft or ritual which is the kind of thing that
happen not infrequ among obscur and ancient african tribe well
thei had abduct their young woman and were in sight of safeti and
success in their object whatev these might be for what possibl
reason then could thei desir to risk a fight with the outrag
friend and rel of that young woman
it wa true that thei outnumb us and therefor had a good chanc
of victori but on the other hand thei must know that it would be veri
dearli won and if it were not won that we should retak their captiv
so that all their troubl would have been for noth further thei must
be as exhaust and travelworn as we were ourselv and in no condit
to face a desper battl
the problem wa beyond me and i gave it up with the reflect that
either thi threaten attack wa a mere feint to delai us or that
behind it wa someth mysteri such as a determin to prevent
us at all hazard from discov the secret of that mountain
stronghold
when i put the riddl to han who wa ly next to me he wa readi
with anoth solut
thei ar meneat baa he said and be hungri wish to eat us
befor thei get to their own land where doubtless thei ar not allow
to eat each other
do you think so i answer when we ar so thin and i survei
han scraggi form in the moonlight
oh ye baa we should be quit good boiledlik old hen baa
also it is the natur of cannib to prefer thin man to fat beef the
devil that is in them give them that tast baa just as he make me
like gin or you turn your head to look at pretti women as those zulu
sai you alwai did in their countri especi at a certain witch who
wa name mameena and whom you kiss befor everybodi
here i turn my head to look at han propos to smite him with
word or physic sinc to have thi mameena myth of which i have
detail the origin in the book call child of storm rearis out
of hi hideou littl mouth wa too much but befor i could get out a
syllabl he held up hi finger and whisper
hush the dawn break and thei come i hear them
i listen intent but could distinguish noth onli strain my
ey present i thought that about a hundr yard down the slope
beneath us in the dim light i caught sight of ghostlik figur flit
from tree to tree also that these figur were draw nearer
look out i said to robertson on my right i believ thei ar
come
man he answer sternli i hope so for whom els have i want to
meet all these dai
now the figur vanish into a littl fold of the ground a minut or
so later thei reappear upon it hither side where such light as there
wa from the fade star and the gather dawn fell full upon them
for here were no tree i look and a thrill of horror went through me
for with on glanc i recognis that these were not the men whom we
had been follow to begin with there were mani more of them quit
a hundr i should think also thei had paint shield wore feather
in their hair and gener so far as i could judg seem to be fat
and fresh
we have been led into an ambush i said first in zulu to umslopogaa
immedi in front and then in english to robertson
if so man we must just do the best we can answer the latter but
god help my poor daughter for those other devil will have taken her
awai leav their brethren to make an end of us
it is so macumazahn broke in umslopogaa well whatev the end of
it we shall have a better fight now do you give the word and we will
obei
the savag for so i call them although i admit that cannib or not
thei look more like highclass arab than savag came on in perfect
silenc hope i suppos to catch us asleep when thei were about
fifti yard awai run in a trebl line with spear advanc i
call out fire in zulu and set the exampl by loos off both
barrel of my express rifl at men whom i had pick out as leader
with result that must have been more satisfactori to me than to the two
amahagg whose troubl in thi world came to an end
there follow a tremend fusillad the zulu bang off their gun
wildli but even at that distanc manag for the most part to shoot
over the enemi head captain robertson and han howev did better
and the gener result wa that the amahagg who appear to be
unaccustom to firearm retreat in a hurri to a fold of the ground
whenc thei had emerg befor the last of them got there i load
again so that two more stop behind altogeth we had put nine or
ten of them out of action
now i hope that thei would give the busi up but thi wa not so
for be brave fellow after a paus of perhap five minut onc
more thei charg in a bodi hope to overwhelm us again we greet
them with bullet and knock out sever whereon the rest threw
a vollei of their long spear at us i wa glad to see them do thi
although on of the zulu got hi death from it while two more were
wound i myself had a veri narrow escap for a spear pass between
my neck and shoulder each of them carri but on of these weapon
and i knew that if thei us them up in throw onli their big knive
would remain to them with which to attack us
after thi discharg of spear which wa kept up for some time thei
rush at us and there follow a great fight the zulu throw down
their gun rose to their feet and hold their littl fight shield
which had been carri in their mat in the left hand wield their
ax with the right umslopogaa who stood in the centr of them
howev had no shield and swung hi great ax with both arm thi wa
the first time that i had seen him fight and the spectacl wa in a wai
magnific again and again the ax crash down and everi time it
fell it left on dead beneath the stroke till at length those amahagg
shrank back out of hi reach
meanwhil robertson han and i stand on some stone at the back
kept up a continu fire upon them shoot over the head of the
zulu who were plai their part like men ye thei shrank back
leav mani dead behind them then a captain tri to gather them for
anoth rush and onc more thei move forward i kill that captain
with a revolv shot for my rifl had becom too hot to hold and at
the sight of hi fall thei broke and ran back into the littl hollow
where our bullet could not reach them
so far we had held our own but at a price for three of the zulu were
now dead and three more wound on of them sever the other two but
enough to crippl them in fact now there were left of them but three
untouch men and umslopogaa so that in all for fight purpos
we were but seven what avail it that we had kill a great number of
these amahagg when we were but seven how could seven men withstand
such anoth onslaught
there in the pale light of the dawn we look at each other dismai
now said umslopogaa lean on hi red ax there remain but on
thing to do make a good end though i would that it were in a greater
caus at least we must either fight or fly and he look down at the
wound
think not of us father murmur on of them the man who had a
mortal hurt if it is best kill us and begon that you mai live to
bear the ax in year to come
well spoken said umslopogaa and again stood still a while then
ad the word is with you macumazahn who ar our captain
i set out the situat to robertson and han as briefli as i could
show that there wa a chanc of life if we ran but so far as i could
see none if we stai
go if you like quatermain answer the captain but i shall stop
and die here for sinc my girl is gone i think im better dead
i motion to han to speak
baa he answer the great medicin is here with us upon the earth
and your reverend father the predik is with us in the sky so i
think we had better stop here and do what we can especi as i do not
want to see those reed ani more at present
so do i i said briefli give no reason
so we made readi for the next attack which we knew would be the last
strengthen our littl wall and drag the dead amahagg up against
it as an ad protect as we were thu engag the sun rose and in
it first beam some mile awai on the oppos slope of the mountain
look tini against the black background of the precipic we saw
a parti of men creep forward lift my glass i studi it and
perceiv that in it midst wa a litter
there goe your daughter i said and hand the glass to robertson
oh my god he answer those villain have outwit us after all
anoth minut and the litter or rather the chair with it escort
had vanish into the shadow of the great cliff probabl up some pass
which we could not see
next moment our thought were otherwis engag sinc from variou
symptom we gather that the attack wa about to be renew spear
upon which shone the light of the rise sun appear abov the edg of
the groundfold that i have mention which to the east increas to a
deep bushclad ravin also there were voic as of leader encourag
their men to a desper effort
thei ar come i said to robertson
ye he answer thei ar come and we ar go it a queer
end to the thing we call life isnt it quatermain and hang it all
i wonder what beyond not much for me i expect but whatev it is
could scarc be wors than what iv gone through here below in on
wai and anoth
there hope for all of us i repli as cheerfulli as i could for
the man deep depress disturb me
mayhap quatermain for who know the infinit merci of whatev made
us as we ar my old mother us to preach of it and i rememb her
word now but in my case i expect it will stop at hope or sleep and
if it wasnt for inez id not mind so much for i tell you iv had
enough of the world and life look there on of them take that you
black devil and lift hi rifl he aim and fire at an amahagg
who appear upon the edg of the fold of ground what is more he hit
him for i saw the man doubl up and fall backward
then the game began afresh for the cannib i suppos thei were
cannib like their brethren crept out of shelter advanc on their
stomach or their hand and knee so as to offer a smaller mark and
drag between them a long and slender treetrunk with which clearli
thei intend to batter down our wall
of cours i blaze awai at them pretti carefulli too for i wa
determin that what i believ to be the last exercis of the gift of
shoot that ha been given to me should prove a record therefor
i select my men and even where i would hit them and as subsequ
examin show i made no mistak in the seven or eight shot that
i fire but all the while like poor captain robertson i wa think
of other thing name where i wa bound for present and if i should
meet certain folk there and what wa the mean of thi show call
life which unless it lead somewher accord to my judgment ha none
at all until these question were solv howev my duti wa to kill
as mani of those ruffian as i could and thi i did with finish and
despatch
robertson and han were fire also with more or less success but
there were too mani to be stop by our three rifl still thei came
on till at length their fierc face were within a few yard of our
littl parapet and umslopogaa had lift hi great ax to give them
greet thei paus a moment befor make their final rush and so
did we to slip in fresh cartridg
die well han i said and if you get there first wait for me on
the other side
ye baa i alwai meant to do that though not yet we ar not go
to die thi time baa those who have the great medicin dont die it
is the other who die like that fellow and he point to an amahagg
who went reel round and round with a bullet from hi winchest
through the middl for he had fire in the midst of hi remark
cursei mean blessth great medicin i said as i lift my rifl
to my shoulder
at that moment all those amahaggerther were about sixti of them
leftbecam seiz with a certain perturb thei stood still thei
stare toward the fold of ground out of which thei had emerg thei
call to each other word which i did not catch and thenthei turn
to run
umslopogaa saw and with a leader instinct act spring over the
parapet follow by hi remain zulu of the ax he leapt upon them
with a roar down thei went befor inkosikaa like corn befor a
sickl the thing wa marvel to see it wa like the charg of a
leopard so swift wa the rush and so lightninglik were the stroke or
rather the peck of that flash ax for now he wa tap at their
head or spine with the gougelik point upon it back nor were these
the onli victim for those brave follow of hi also did their part
in a minut all who remain upon their feet of the amahagg were in
full flight vanish thi wai and that among the tree han fire
a part shot after the last of them then sat down upon a stone and
find hi corncob pipe proceed to fill it
the great medicin baa he began sententi or perhap
your reverend father the predik here he paus and point
doubtfulli with the bowl of the pipe toward the fold in the ground
ad here it is but i think it must be your reverend father not
the great medicin ye the predik himself return from heaven
the place of fire
look vagu in the direct indic for i could not conceiv
what he meant and thought that the excit must have made him mad i
perceiv a vener old man with a long white beard and cloth in a
flow garment also white who remind me of father christma at a
child parti walk toward us and radiat benign also behind
him i perceiv a whole forest of spear point emerg from the gulli
he seem to take it for grant that we should not shoot at him for he
came on quit unconcern carefulli pick hi wai among the corps
when he wa near enough he stop and said in a kind of arab which i
could understand
i greet you stranger in the name of her i serv i see that i am
just in time but thi doe not surpris me sinc she said that it
would be so you seem to have done veri well with these dog and
he prod a dead amahagg with hi sandal foot ye veri well
inde you must be great warrior
then he paus and we stare at each other
chapter xi
through the mountain wall
these do not seem to be friend of your i said point to the
fallen and yet i ad nod toward the spearmen who were now
emerg from the gulli thei ar veri like your friend
puppi from the same litter ar often alik yet when thei grow up
sometim thei fight each other repli father christma blandli
at least these come to save and not to kill you look thei kill the
other and he point to them make an end of some of the wound
men but who ar these and he glanc with evid astonish
first at the fearsomelook umslopogaa and then at the grotesqu
han nai answer not you must be weari and need rest afterward we
can talk
well as a matter of fact we have not yet breakfast i repli
also i have busi to attend to here and i glanc at our wound
the old fellow nod and went to speak to the captain of hi forc
doubtless as to the pursuit of the enemi for present i saw a compani
spring forward on their track then assist by han and the remain
zulu of whom on wa goroko i turn to attend to our own peopl
the task prove lighter than i expect sinc the badli injur man
wa dead or dy and the hurt of the two other were in their leg
and compar slight such as goroko could doctor in hi own nativ
fashion
after thi take han to guard my back i went down to the stream and
wash myself then i return and at wonder the while that i could
do so with appetit after the terribl danger which we had pass
still we had pass them and robertson umslopogaa with three of hi
men i and han were quit unharm a fact for which i return thank
in silenc but sincer enough to provid
han also return thank in hi own fashion after he had fill
himself not befor and lit hi corncob pipe but robertson made no
remark inde when he had satisfi hi natur crave he rose and
walk a few pace forward stood stare at the cleft in the mountain
cliff into which he had seen the litter vanish that bore hi daughter to
some fate unknown
even the great fight that we had fought and the victori we had won
against overpow odd did not appear to impress him he onli glare
at the mountain into the heart of which inez had been rape awai and
shook hi fist sinc she wa gone all els went for noth so much so
that he did not offer to assist with the wound zulu or show curios
about the strang old man by whom we had been rescu
the great medicin baa said han in a bewild wai is even more
power than i thought not onli ha it brought us safe through the
fight and without a scratch for those zulu there do not matter and
there will be less cook for me to do now that thei ar gone it ha
also brought down your reverend father the predik from the place of
fire in heaven somewhat chang from what i rememb him it is
true but still without doubt the same when i make my report to him
present if he can understand my talk i shall
stop your infern nonsens you son of a donkei i broke in for at
thi moment old father christma smile more benignli than befor
reappear from the kloof into which he had vanish and advanc
toward us bow with much polit
have seat himself upon the littl wall that we had built up
he contempl us stroke hi beauti white beard then said
address me
of a certainti you should be proud who with a few have defeat so
mani still had i not been order to come at speed i think that by
now you would have been as those ar and he look toward the dead
zulu who were laid out at a distanc like men asleep while their
companion sought for a place to buri them
order by whom i ask
there is onli on who can order he answer with mild astonish
shewhocommand shewhoiseverlast
it occur to me that thi must be some arab idiom for the etern
feminin but i onli look vagu and said
it would appear that there ar some whom thi exalt everlast she
cannot command those who attack us also those who have fled awai
yonder and i wave my hand toward the mountain
no command is absolut in everi countri there ar rebel even as i
have heard in heaven abov us but wander what is your name
watcherbynight i answer
ah a good name for on who must have watch well by night and by dai
too to reach thi countri live where shewhocommand sai that no
man of your colour ha set foot for mani gener inde i think
she told me onc that two thousand year had gone by sinc she spoke to
a white man in the citi of kr
did she inde i exclaim stifl a cough
you do not believ me he went on smile well shewhocommand
can explain matter for herself better than i who wa not aliv two
thousand year ago so far as i rememb but what must i call him with
the ax
warrior is hi name
again a good name as to judg by the wound on them certain of those
rebel i think ar now tell each other in hell and thi man if
inde he be a man he ad look doubtfulli at han
lightindark is hi name
i see doubtless becaus hi colour is that of the winter sun in thick
fog or a bad egg broken into milk and the other white man who mutter
and whose brow is like a storm
he is call aveng you will learn why later on i answer
impati for i grew tire of thi catech ad and what ar
you call and if you ar pleas to tell it to us upon what errand do
you visit us in so fortun an hour
i am name billali he answer the servant and messeng of
shewhocommand and i wa sent to save you and to bring you safe to
her
how can thi be billali see that none knew of our come
yet shewhocommand knew he said with hi benign smile inde
i think that she learn of it some moon ago through a messag that wa
sent to her and so arrang all thing that you should be guid safe
to her secret home sinc otherwis how would you have pass a great
pathless swamp with the loss i think she said of but on man whom a
snake bit
now i stare at the old fellow for how could he know of the death of
thi man but thought it useless to pursu the convers further
when you ar rest and readi he went on we will start meanwhil i
leav you that i mai prepar litter to carri those wound men and
you also watcherbynight if you wish then with a dignifi bow
for everyth about thi old fellow wa state he turn and vanish
into the kloof
the next hour or so wa occupi in the burial of the dead zulu a
ceremoni in which i took no part beyond stand up and rais my hat
as thei were born awai for as i have said somewher it is best to
leav nativ alon on these occas inde i lai down reflect
that strang enough there seem to be someth in old zikali tale
of a wonder white queen who live in a mountain fast sinc there
wa the mountain as he had drawn it on the ash and the servant of
that queen who appar had knowledg of our come appear in the
nick of time to rescu us from on of the tightest fix in which ever i
found myself
moreov the antiqu and courteou individu call billali spoke of
her as shewhoiseverlast what the deuc could he mean by that
i wonder probabl that she wa veri old and therefor disagre to
look on which i confess to myself would be a disappoint
and how did she know that we were come i could not guess and when i
ask robertson he mere shrug hi shoulder and intim that he
took no interest in the matter the truth is that noth move the man
whose whole soul wa wrap in on desir name to rescu or aveng
the daughter against whom he knew he had so sore sin
in fact thi looseliv but reform seaman wa becom a
monomaniac and what is more on of the religi type he had a bibl
with him that had been given to him by hi mother when he wa a boi and
in thi he read constantli also he wa alwai on hi knee and at night
i could hear him groan and prai aloud doubtless now that the
chain of drink had fallen off him the instinct and the blood of
the dour old covenant from whom he wa descend were assert
themselv in a wai thi wa a good thing though for some time past
i had fear lest it should end in hi go mad and certainli as a
companion he wa more cheer in hi unregener dai
abandon specul as useless and take my chanc of be murder
where i lai for after all billali follow were singularli like
the men with whom we had been fight and for aught i knew might be
anim by ident objectsi just went to sleep as i can do at
ani time to wake up an hour or so later feel wonderfulli refresh
han who when i close my ey wa alreadi asleep slumber at my feet
curl up like a dog on a spot where the sun struck hotli rous me by
sai
awak baa thei ar here
i sprang up snatch at my rifl for i thought that he meant that
we were be attack again to see billali advanc at the head of
a train of four litter made of bamboo with grass mat for curtain
and cover each of which wa carri by stalwart amahagg as i
suppos that thei must be two of these the finest billali indic
were for robertson and myself and the two other for the wound
umslopogaa and the remain zulu evid were expect to walk as
wa han
how did you make these so quickli i ask survei their eleg
and inde artist workmanship
we did not make them watcherbynight we brought them with us fold
up shewhocommand look in her glass and said that four would be
need besid my own which is yonder two for white lord and two for
wound black men which you see is the number requir
ye i answer vagu marvel what kind of a glass it wa that
gave the ladi thi inform
befor i could inquir upon the point billali ad
you will be glad to learn that my men caught some of those rebel who
dare to attack you eight or ten of them who had been hurt by your
missil or axecut and put them to death in the proper fashiony
quit the proper fashion and he smile a littl the rest had gone
too far where it would have been danger to follow them among the
rock enter now my lord watcherbynight for the road is steep and we
must travel fast if we would reach the place where shewhocommand is
camp in the ancient holi citi befor the moon sink behind the cliff
tonight
so have explain matter to robertson and umslopogaa who announc
that noth would induc him to be carri like an old woman or
a corps upon a shield and seen that the hurt zulu were comfort
accommod robertson and i got into our litter which prove to be
delightfulli easi and rest
then when our gear wa collect by the hooknos bearer to whom we
were oblig to trust though we kept with us our rifl and a certain
amount of ammunit we start first went a number of billali
spearmen then came the litter with the wound alongsid of which
umslopogaa and hi three uninjur zulu talk or trot then
anoth litter contain billali then my own by which ran han
and robertson and lastli the rest of the amahagg and the relief
bearer
i see now baa said han thrust hi head between my curtain
that yonder whitebeard cannot be your reverend father the predik
after all
why not i ask though the fact wa fairli obviou
becaus baa if he were he would not have left han of whom he
alwai thought so well to run in the sun like a dog while he and
other travel in carriag like great white ladi
you had better save your breath instead of talk nonsens han i
said sinc i believ that you have a long wai to go
in fact it prove to be a veri long wai inde especi as after we
began to breast the mountain we must travel slowli we start about
ten oclock in the morn for the fight which after all did not take
longhad it will be rememb begun shortli after dawn and it wa
three in the afternoon befor we reach the base of the tower cliff
which i have mention
here at the foot of a remark isol column of rock on which i
wa destin to see a strang sight in the after dai we halt and at
of the remain food which we had brought with us while the amahagg
consum their own that seem to consist larg of curdl milk such
as the zulu call maa and lump of a kind of bread
i note that thei were a veri curiou peopl who fed in silenc and on
whose handsom solemn face on never saw a smile somehow it gave me
the creep to look at them robertson wa affect in the same wai for
in on of the rare interv of hi abstract he remark that thei
were no canni then he ad
ask yon old wizard who might be on of the bibl prophet come to
lifewhat those maneat devil have done with my daughter
i did so and billali answer
sai that thei have taken her awai to make a queen of her sinc have
rebel against their own queen thei must have anoth who is white
sai too that shewhocommand will wage war on them and perhap win her
back unless thei kill her first
ah robertson repeat when i had translat unless thei kill her
firstor wors then he relaps into hi usual silenc
present we start on again head straight for what look like a
sheer wall of black rock a thousand feet or more in height up a path so
steep that robertson and i got out and walk or rather scrambl in
order to eas the bearer billali i notic remain in hi litter
the conveni of the bearer did not troubl him he onli order an
extra gang to the pole i could not imagin how we were to negoti
thi precipic nor could umslopogaa who look at it and said
if we ar to climb that macumazahn i think that the onli on who will
live to get to the top will be that littl yellow monkei of your and
he point with hi ax at han
if i do repli that worthi much nettl for he hate to be call
a yellow monkei by the zulu be sure that i will roll down stone
upon ani black butcher whom i see sprawl upon the cliff below
umslopogaa smile grimli for he had a sens of humour and could
appreci a reparte even when it hit him hard then we stop talk
for the climb took all our breath
at length we came to the cliff face where to all appear our
journei must end suddenli howev out of the blind black wall in
front of us start the apparit of a tall man arm with a great
spear and wear a white robe who challeng us hoars
suddenli he stood befor us as a ghost might do though whenc he came
we could not see present the mysteri wa explain here in the cliff
face there wa a cleft though on invis even from a few pace awai
sinc it outer edg project over the inner wall of rock moreov
thi open wa not abov four feet in width a mere split in the huge
mountain mass caus by some titan convuls in past ag for it wa
a definit split sinc onc enter far far abov could be trace
a faint line of light come from the sky although the gloom of the
passag wa such that torch which were store at hand must be us
by those who thread it on man could have held the place against a
hundreduntil he wa kill still it wa guard not onli at the
mouth where the warrior had appear but further along at everi turn in
the jag chasm and these were mani
into thi grim place we went the zulu did not like it at all for
thei ar a lightlov peopl and i note that even umslopogaa
seem scare and hung back a littl nor did han who with hi usual
suspicion fear some trap nor for the matter of that did i though
i thought it well to appear much interest onli robertson seem quit
indiffer and trudg along stolidli after a man carri a torch
old billali put hi head out of the litter and shout back to me
to fear noth sinc there were no pitfal in the path hi voic
echo strang between those narrow wall of measureless height
for half an hour or more we pursu thi dreari wind path round the
corner of which the draught tore in gust so fierc that more than onc
the litter with the wound men and those who bore them were nearli
blown over it wa safe enough howev sinc on either side of us
smooth and without break rose the sheer wall of rock over which lai
the tini ribbon of blue sky at length the cleft widen somewhat and
the light grew stronger make the torch unnecessari
then of a sudden we came to it end and found ourselv upon a littl
plateau in the mountainsid behind us for a thousand feet or so rose
the sheer rock wall as it did upon the outer face while in front and
beneath far beneath wa a beauti plain circular in shape and of
great extent which plain wa everywher surround so far as i could
see by the same wall of rock in short notwithstand it enorm
size without doubt it wa neither more nor less than the crater of a
vast extinct volcano lastli not far from the centr of thi plain wa
what appear to be a citi sinc through my glass i could see great
wall built of stone and what i thought were hous all of them of a
charact more substanti than ani that i had discov in the wild
of africa
i went to billali litter and ask him who live in the citi
no on he answer it ha been dead for thousand of year but
shewhocommand is camp there at present with an armi and thither we
go at onc forward bearer
so robertson and i have reenter our litter we start on down
hill at a rapid pace for the road though steep wa safe and kept in
good order all the rest of that afternoon we travel and by sunset
reach the edg of the plain where we halt a while to rest and eat
till the light of the grow moon grew strong enough to enabl us to
proce umslopogaa came up and spoke to me
here is a fortress inde macumazahn he said sinc none can climb
that fenc of rock in which the hole seem to be few and small
ye i answer but it is on out of which those who ar in would
find it difficult to get out we ar buffalo in a pit umslopogaa
that is so he answer i have thought it alreadi but if ani would
meddl with us we still have our horn and can toss for a while
then he went back to hi men
the sunset in that great solemn place wa a wonder thing to see
first of all the measureless crater wa fill with light like a bowl
with fire then as the great orb sank behind the western cliff half of
the plain becam quit dark while shadow seem to rush forward over
the eastern part of it surfac till that too wa swallow up in gloom
and for a littl while there remain onli a glow reflect from the
cliff face and from the sky abov while on the crest of the parapet of
rock plai strang and gloriou fire present these too vanish and
the world wa dark
then the half moon broke from behind a bank of cloud and by it silver
uncertain light we struggl forward across the flat plain rather
slowli now for even the iron muscl of those bearer grew tire i
could not see much of it but i gather that we were pass through
crop veri fine crop to judg by their height as doubtless thei would
be upon thi lava soil also onc or twice we splash through stream
at length be tire and lull by the swai of the litter and by
the sound of a weird low chant that the bearer had set up now that
thei near home and were afraid of no attack i sank into a doze when
i awok again it wa to find that the litter had halt and to hear the
voic of billali sai
descend white lord and come with your companion the black warrior
and the yellow man who is name lightindark shewhocommand
desir to see you at onc befor you eat and sleep and must not be
kept wait fear not for the other thei will be care for till you
return
chapter xii
the white witch
i descend from the litter and told the other what the old fellow had
said robertson did not want to come and inde refus to do so until
i suggest to him that such conduct might prejudic a power person
against us umslopogaa wa indiffer put as he remark no
faith in a ruler who wa a woman
onli han although he wa so tire acquiesc with some eager
the fact be that hi brain wa more alert and that he had all the
curios of the monkei tribe which he so much resembl in appear
and want to see thi queen whom zikali rever
in the end we start conduct by billali and by men who carri
torch whereof the light show me that we were pass between hous
or at ani rate wall that had been those of hous and along what
seem to be a pave street
walk under what i took to be a great arch or portico we came into
a court that wa full of tower pillar but unroof for i could see
the star abov at it end we enter a build of which the doorwai
wa hung with mat to find that it wa light with lamp and that
all down it length on either side guard with long spear stood at
interv
oh baa said han hesitatingli thi is the mouth of a trap while
umslopogaa glare about him suspici finger the handl of hi
great ax
be silent i answer all thi mountain is a trap therefor anoth
doe not matter and we have our pistol
walk forward between the doubl line of guard who stood immov as
statu we came to some curtain hung at the end of a long narrow hall
which although i know littl of such thing were i note made of
rich stuff embroid in colour and with golden thread befor these
curtain billali motion us to halt
after a whisper colloqui with someon beyond carri on through the
join of the curtain he vanish between them leav us alon for
five minut or more at length thei open and a tall and eleg woman
with an arab cast of counten and clad in white robe appear and
beckon to us to enter she did not speak or answer when i spoke to
her which wa not wonder as afterward i discov that she wa a
mute we went in i wonder veri much what we were go to see
on the further side of the curtain wa a room of no great size
illumin with lamp of which the light fell upon sculptur wall it
look to me as though it might onc have been the inmost court or a
sanctuari of some templ for at it head wa a dai upon which onc
perhap had stood the shrine or statu of a god on thi dai there wa
now a couch and on the coucha goddess
there she sat straight and still cloth in shine white and veil
but with her draperi so arrang that thei emphasis rather than
conceal the wonder eleg of her tall form from beneath the
veil which wa such as a bride wear appear two plait of glossi
raven hair of great length to the end of each of which wa suspend a
singl larg pearl on either side of her stood a tall woman like to her
who had led us through the curtain and on hi knee in front but to
the right knelt billali
about thi seat personag there wa an air of singular majesti such
as might pervad a queen as fanci paint her though she had a nobler
figur than ani queen i ever saw depict mysteri seem to flow from
her it cloth her like the veil she wore which of cours heighten
the effect beauti flow from her also although it wa shroud i knew
that it wa there no veil or cover could obscur itat least to
my imagin moreov she breath out power also on felt it in the
air as on feel a thunderstorm befor it break and it seem to me
that thi power wa not quit human that it drew it strength from afar
and dwelt a stranger to the earth
to tell the truth although my curios alwai strong wa enorm
excit and though now i felt glad that i had attempt thi journei
with all it peril i wa horribl afraid so much afraid that i should
have like to turn and run awai from the begin i knew myself to
be in the presenc of an unearthli be cloth in soft and perfect
woman flesh someth alien too and differ from our human race
what a pictur it all made there she sat quiet and state as a
perfect marbl statu onli her breast rise and fall beneath the
white robe show that she wa aliv and breath as other do anoth
thing show it alsoh ey at first i could not see them through
the veil but present either becaus i grew accustom to the light
or becaus thei brighten as those of certain anim have power to do
when thei watch intent it ceas to be a cover to them distinctli
i saw them now larg and dark and splendid with a ting of deep blue
in the iri allur and yet aw in their majest aloof which
seem to look through and beyond to embrac all without seek and
without effort those ey were like window through which light flow
from within a light of the spirit
i glanc round to see the effect of thi vision upon my companion it
wa most peculiar han had sunk to hi knee hi hand were join in
the attitud of prayer and hi ugli littl face remind me of that of a
big fish out of water and dy from excess of air robertson startl
out of hi abstract stare at the royallook woman on the couch
with hi mouth open
man he whisper iv got them back although i have touch noth
for week onli thi time thei ar love for yon no human ladi i
feel it in my bone
umslopogaa stood great and grim hi hand rest on the handl of hi
tall ax and he stare also the blood puls against the skin that
cover the hole in hi head
watcherbynight he said to me in hi deep voic but also speak
in a whisper thi chieftai is not on woman but all women
beneath those robe of her i seem to see the beauti of on who ha
gone beyond of the lili who is lost to me do you not feel it thu
macumazahn
now that he mention it certainli i did inde i had felt it
all along although amid the rush of sensat thi on had scarc
disentangl itself in my mind i look at the drape shape and
sawwel never mind whom i saw it wa not on onli but sever in
sequenc also a woman who at that time i did not know although i came
to know her afterward too well perhap or at ani rate quit
enough to puzzl me the odd thing wa that in thi hallucin the
person of these individu seem to overlap and merg till at
last i began to wonder whether thei were not part of the same entiti
or be manifest itself in sundri shape yet spring from on
centr as differ colour rai flow from the same crystal while the
beam from their sourc of light shift and chang but the fanci is too
metaphys for my poor power to express as clearli as i would also
no doubt it wa but a hallucin that had it origin perhap in the
mischiev brain of her who sat befor us
at length she spoke and her voic sound like silver bell heard over
water in a great calm it wa low and sweet oh so sweet that at it
first note for a moment my sens seem to swoon and my puls to stop
it wa to me that she address herself
my servant here and ever so slightli she turn her head toward the
kneel billali tell me that you who ar name watcherinthenight
understand the tongu in which i speak to you is it so
i understand arab of a kind well enough have learn it on the
east coast and from arab in past year but not such arab as you us
o and i paus
call me hiya she broke in which is my titl here mean as you
know she or woman or if that doe not pleas you call me ayesha
it would rejoic me after so long to hear the name i bore spoken by the
lip of on of my colour and of gentl blood
i blush at the compliment so artfulli convei and repeat stupidli
enough
not such arab as you us oayesha
i thought that you would like the sound of the word better than that
of hiya though afterward i will teach you to pronounc it as you
should ohav you ani other name save watcherbynight which seem
also to be a titl
ye i answer allan
oallan tell me of these she went on quickli indic my
companion with a sweep of her slender hand for thei do not speak
arab i think or stai i will tell you of them and you shall sai if
i do so rightli thi on and she nod toward robertson is a man
bemus there come from him a colour which i see if you cannot and
that colour betoken a desir for reveng though i think that in hi
time he ha desir other thing also as i rememb men alwai did from
the begin to their ruin human natur doe not chang allan and
wine and women ar ancient snare enough of him for thi time the
littl yellow on there is afraid of me as ar all of you that is
woman greatest power although she is so weak and gentl men ar
still afraid of her just becaus thei ar so foolish that thei cannot
understand her to them after a million year she still remain the
unknown and to us all the unknown is also the aw do you rememb the
proverb of the roman that sai it well and briefli
i nod for it wa on of the latin tag that my father had taught me
good well he is a littl wild man is he not nearer to the ap from
whose race our bodi come but do you know that allan
i nod again and said
there ar disput upon the point ayesha
ye thei had begun in my dai and we will discuss them later still i
saynear to the ap than you or i and therefor of interest as the
germ of thing is alwai yet he ha qualiti i think cun and
fidel and love which in it round is all in all do you understand
allan that love is all in all
i answer warili that it depend upon what she meant by love to which
she repli that she would explain afterward when we had leisur to
talk ad
what thi littl yellow monkei understand by it at least ha serv
you well or so i believ you shall tell me the tale of it some dai
now of the last thi black on here i think is a man inde a warrior
of warrior such as there us to be in the earli world if a savag
well believ me allan savag ar often the best moreov all ar
still savag at heart even you and i for what is term cultur is
but coat upon coat of paint laid on to hide our nativ colour and often
there is poison in the paint that ax of hi ha drunk deep i think
though alwai in fair fight and i sai that it shall drink deeper yet
have i read these men aright allan
not so ill i answer
i thought it she said with a music laugh although at thi place i
rust and grow dull like an unus sword now you would rest goall of
you tomorrow you and i will talk alon fear noth for your safeti
you ar watch by my slave and i watch my slave until tomorrow
then farewel go now eat and sleep as ala we all must do who linger
on thi ball of earth and cling to a life we should do well to lose
billali lead them henc and she wave her hand to signifi that the
audienc wa end
at thi sign han who appar wa still much afraid rose from hi
knee and liter bolt through the curtain robertson follow him
umslopogaa stood a moment drew himself up and lift the great ax
cri bayt after which he too turn and went
what doe that word mean allan she ask
i explain that it wa the salut which the zulu peopl onli give
to king
did i not sai that savag ar often the best she exclaim in a
gratifi voic the white man your companion gave me no salut but
the black on know when he stand befor a woman who is royal
he too is of royal blood in hi own land i said
if so we ar akin allan
then i bow deepli to her in my best manner and rise from her couch
for the first time she stood up look veri tall and command and
bow back
after thi i went to find the other on the further side of the
curtain except han who had run down the long narrow hall and through
the mat at it end we follow march with digniti behind billali
and between the doubl line of guard who rais their spear as we
pass them and on the further side of the mat discov han still
look terrifi
baa he said to me as we thread our wai through the court of
column in my life i have seen all kind of dread thing and face
them but never have i been so much afraid as i am of that white witch
baa i think that she is the devil of whom your reverend father the
predik us to talk so much or perhap hi wife
if so han i answer the devil is not so black as he is paint
but i advis you to be care of what you sai as she mai have long
ear
it doesnt matter at all what on sai baa becaus she read
thought befor thei pass the lip i felt her do it there in that
room and do you be care baa or she will eat up your spirit and
make you fall in love with her who i expect is veri ugli inde
sinc otherwis she would not wear a veil whoever saw a pretti woman
tie up her head in a sack baa
perhap she doe thi becaus she is so beauti han that she fear
the heart of men who look upon her would melt
oh no baa all women want to melt men heart the more the better
thei seem to have other thing in their mind but realli thei think of
noth els until thei ar too old and ugli and it take them a long
while to be sure of that
so han went on talk hi shrewd nonsens till follow so far as
i could see the same road as that by which we had come we reach our
quarter where we found food prepar for us broil goat flesh
with corncak and milk i think it wa also bed for us two white men
cover with skin rug and blanket woven of wool
these quarter i should explain consist of room in a hous built
of stone of which the wall had onc been paint the roof of the hous
wa gone now for we could see the star shine abov us but as the
air wa veri soft in thi shelter plain thi wa an advantag rather
than otherwis the largest room wa reserv for robertson and myself
while anoth at the back wa given to umslopogaa and hi zulu and a
third to the two wound men
billali show us these arrang by the light of lamp and
apologis that thei were not better becaus as he explain the place
wa a ruin and there had been no time to build us a hous he ad that
we might sleep without fear as we were guard and none would dare to
harm the guest of shewhocommand on whom he wa sure we or at ani
rate i and the black warrior had produc an excel impress then
he bow himself out sai that he would return in the morn and
left us to our own devic
robertson and i sat down on stool that had been set for us and at
but he seem so overcom by hi experi or by hi sombr thought
that i could not draw him into convers all he remark wa that
we had fallen into queer compani and that those who sup with satan
need a long spoon have deliv himself of thi sentiment he
threw himself upon the bed prai aloud for a while as had becom hi
fashion to be protect from warlock and witch amongst other
thing and went to sleep
befor i turn in i visit umslopogaass room to see that all wa well
with him and hi peopl and found him stand in the doorwai stare
at the starspangl sky
greet macumazahn he said you who ar white and wise and i am
black and a fighter have seen mani strang thing beneath the sun but
never such a on as we have look upon tonight who and what is that
chieftai macumazahn
i do not know i said but it is worth while to have live to see
her even though she be veil
nor do i macumazahn nai i do know for my heart tell me that she
is the greatest of all witch and that you will do well to guard your
spirit lest she should steal it awai if she were not a witch should i
have seem to behold the shape of nada the lili who wa the wife of my
youth beneath those white robe of her and though the tongu in which
she spoke wa strang to me to hear the murmur of nada voic between
her lip of nada who ha gone further from me than those star it
is good that you wear the great medicin of zikali upon your breast
macumazahn for perhap it will shield you from harm at those hand that
ar shape of ivori
zikali is anoth of the tribe i answer laugh although less
beauti to see also i am not afraid of ani of them and from thi
on if she be more than some white woman whom it pleas to veil
herself i shall hope to gather wisdom
ye macumazahn such wisdom as spirit and the dead have to give
mayhap umslopogaa but we came here to seek spirit and the dead did
we not
ay answer umslopogaa these and war and i think that we shall
find enough of all three onli i hope that war will come the first lest
the spirit and the dead should bewitch me and take awai my skill and
courag
then we part and too tire even to wonder ani more i threw myself
down on my bed and slept
i wa awaken when the sun wa alreadi high by the sound of robertson
who wa on hi knee prai aloud as usual a habit of hi which i
confess got on my nerv prayer in my opinion is a privat matter
between man and hi creator that is except in church further i did
not in the least wish to hear all about robertson sin which seem
to have been mani and peculiar it is bad enough to have to bear the
burden of on own transgress without learn of those of other
peopl that is unless on is a priest and must do so profession
so i jump up to escap and make arrang for a wash onli to
butt into old billali who wa stand in the doorwai contempl
robertson with much interest and stroke hi white beard
he greet me with hi courteou bow and said
tell your companion o watcher that it is not necessari for him to go
upon hi knee to shewhocommandsand must be obei he ad with
emphasi when he is not in her presenc and that even then he would
do well to keep silent sinc so much talk in a strang tongu might
troubl her
i burst out laugh and answer
he doe not go upon hi knee and prai to shewhocommand but to the
great on who is in the sky
inde watcher well here we onli know a great on who is upon the
earth though it is true that perhap she visit the ski sometim
is it so billali i answer incredul and now i would ask you
to take me to some place where i can bath
it is readi he repli come
so i call to han who wa hang about with a rifl on hi arm to
follow with a cloth and soap of which fortun we had a coupl of
piec left and we start along what had onc been a pave roadwai
run between stone hous whereof the timeeaten ruin still
remain on either side
who and what is thi queen of your billali i ask as we went
sure she is not of the amahagg blood
ask it of herself o watcher for i cannot tell you all i know is
that i can trace my own famili for ten gener and that my tenth
forefath told hi son on hi deathb for the sai ha come down
through hi descendantsthat when he wa young shewhocommand had
rule the land for more score of year than he could count month of
life
i stop and stare at him sinc the lie wa so amaz that it seem
to depriv me of the power of motion note my veri obviou disbelief
he continu blandli
if you doubt ask and now here is where you mai bath
then he led me through an arch doorwai and down a wreck passag to
what veri obvious onc had been a splendid bathhous such as some i
have seen pictur of that were built by the roman it size wa that
of a larg room it wa construct of a kind of marbl with a slope
bottom that vari from three to seven feet in depth and water still
ran in and out of it through larg glaze pipe moreov round it wa
a footwai about five feet across from which open chamber unroof
now that the bather us as dressingroom while between these
chamber stood the remain of statu on at the end inde where an
alcov had protect it from sun and weather wa still quit perfect
except for the outstretch arm which were gone the right hand i
notic ly at the bottom of the bath it wa that of a nude young
woman in the attitud of dive a veri beauti bit of work i
thought though of cours i am no judg of sculptur even the smile
mingl with trepid upon the girl face wa most natur
portrai
thi statu show two thing that the bath wa us by femal and
that the peopl who built it were highli civilis also that thei
belong to an advanc if somewhat eastern race sinc the girl nose
wa if anyth semit in charact and her lip though prettili
shape were full for the rest the basin wa so clean that i presum
it must have been made readi for me or other recent bather and at
it bottom i discov grate and broken pipe of earthenwar which
suggest that in the old dai the water could be warm by mean of a
furnac
thi relic of a longpast civilis excit han even more than it
did myself sinc have never seen anyth of the sort he thought it
so strang that as he inform me he imagin that it must have been
built by witchcraft in it i had a most delight and muchneed bath
even han wa persuad to follow my examplea thing i had rare known
him to do beforeand seat in it shallowest part splash some water
over hi yellow wrinkl anatomi then we return to our hous where
i found an excel breakfast had been provid which wa brought to
us by tall silent handsom women who survei us out of the corner of
their ey but said noth
shortli after i had finish my meal billali who had disappear came
back again and said that shewhocommand desir my presenc as she
would speak with me also that i must come alon so after attend to
the wound who both seem to be get on well i went follow by
han arm with hi rifl though i onli carri my revolv robertson
wish to accompani me as he did not seem to care about be left
alon with the zulu in that strang place but thi billali would not
allow inde when he persist two great men step forward and
cross their spear befor him in a somewhat threaten fashion then
at my entreati for i fear lest troubl should aris he gave in and
return to the hous
follow our path of the night befor we walk up a ruin street
which i could see wa onli on of score in what had onc been a veri
great citi until we came to the archwai that i have mention a larg
on now overgrown with plant that from their yellow sweetscent
bloom i judg to be a speci of wallflow also with a kind of
houseleek or saxifrag
here han wa stop by guard billali explain to me that he must
await my return an order which he obei unwillingli enough then i
went on down the narrow passag line as befor by guard who stood
silent as statu and came to the curtain at the end befor these at
a motion from billali who did not seem to dare to speak in thi place
i stood still and wait
chapter xiii
allan hear a strang tale
for some minut i remain befor those curtain until had it not been
for someth electr in the air which got into my bone a kind of
forc that perhap in my fanci onli seem to pervad the place
i should certainli have grown bore inde i wa about to ask my
companion why he did not announc our arriv instead of stand there
like a stuck pig with hi ey shut as though in prayer or medit
when the curtain part and from between them appear on of
those tall wait women whom we had seen on the previou night she
contempl us grave for a few moment then move her hand twice
onc forward toward billali as a signal to him to retir which he did
with great rapid and next in a beckon fashion toward myself to
invit me to follow her
i obei pass between the thick curtain which she fasten in some
wai behind me and found myself in the same roof and sculptur room
that i have alreadi describ onli now there were no lamp such light
as penetr it come from an open abov that i could not see and
fall upon the dai at it head also on her who sat upon the dai
ye there she wa in her white robe and veil the point and centr of
a littl lake of light a wondrou and in a sens a spiritu vision
for in truth there wa someth about her which wa not of the world
someth that drew and yet frighten me still as a statu she sat
like on to whom time is of no account and who ha grown weari of
motion and on either side of her yet more still like caryatid
support a shrine stood two of the state women who were her
attend
for the rest a sweet and subtl odour pervad the chamber which took
hold of my sens as hasheesh might do which i wa sure proceed
from her or from her garment for i could see no perfum burn she
spoke no word yet i knew she wa invit me to come nearer and move
forward till i reach a curiou carv chair that wa place just
beneath the dai and there halt not like to sit down without
permiss
for a long while she contempl me for as befor i could feel her
ey search me from head to foot and as it were look through me as
though she would discov my veri soul then at length she move wave
those two ivori arm of her outward with a kind of swim stroke
whereon the women to right and left of her turn and glide awai i
know not whither
sit allan she said and let us talk for i think we have much to
sai to each other have you slept well and eatenthough i fear that
the food is but rough also wa the bath made readi for you
ye ayesha i answer to all three question ad for i knew not
what to sai it seem to be a veri ancient bath
when i last saw it she repli it wa well enough with statu
stand round it work by a sculptor who had seen beauti in hi
dream but in two thousand yearsor is it moreth tooth of time
bite deep and doubtless like all els in thi dead place it is now a
ruin
i cough to cover up the exclam of disbelief that rose to my lip
and remark blandli that two thousand year wa certainli a long time
when you sai on thing allan and mean anoth your arab is even
more vile than usual and doe not serv to cloak your thought
it mai be so ayesha for i onli know that tongu as i do mani other of
the dialect of africa by learn it from common men my own speech
is english in which if you ar acquaint with it i should prefer to
talk
i know not english which doubtless is some languag that ha arisen
sinc i left the world perhap later you shall teach it to me i tell
you you anger me whom it is not well to anger becaus you believ
noth that pass my lip and yet do not dare to sai so
how can i believ on ayesha who if i understand aright speak of
have seen a certain bath two thousand year ago wherea on hundr
year ar the full dai of man forgiv me therefor if i cannot believ
what i know to be untru
now i thought that she would be veri angri and wa sorri that i had
spoken but as it happen she wa not
you must have courag to give me the lie so boldlyand i like
courag she said who have been cring to for so long inde i
know that you ar brave who have heard how you bore yourself in the
fight yesterdai and much els about you i think that we shall be
friend butseek no more
what els should i seek ayesha i ask innoc
now you ar ly again she said who know well that no man who is
a man see a woman who is beauti and pleas him without wonder
whether should he desir it she could come to love him that is if
she be young
which at least is not possibl if she ha live two thousand year
then natur she would prefer to wear a veil i said boldli seek
to avoid the argument into which i saw she wish to drag me
ah she answer the littl yellow man who is name
lightindark put that thought into your heart i think oh do not
troubl as to how i know it who have mani spi here as he guess
well enough so a woman who ha live two thousand year must be hideou
and wrinkl must she the stamp of youth and loveli must long have
fled from her of that you the wise man ar sure veri well now you
tempt me to do what i had determin i would not do and you shall pluck
the fruit of that tree of curios which grow so fast within you
look allan and sai whether i am old and hideou even though i have
live two thousand year upon the earth and mayhap mani more
then she lift her hand and did someth to her veil so that for
a momentonli on momenth face wa reveal after which the veil
fell into it place
i look i saw and if that chair had lack a back i believ that i
should have fallen out of it to the ground as for what i sawwel
it cannot be describ at ani rate by me except perhap as a flash of
glori
everi man ha dream of perfect beauti base hi idea of it perhap
on that of some woman he ha met who chanc to take hi fanci with
a few accessori from splendid pictur or greek statu thrown in
plu a garnish of the imagin at ani rate i have and here
wa that perfect beauti multipli by ten such beauti that at the
sight of it the sens reel and yet i repeat that it is not to be
describ
i do not know what the nose or the lip were like in fact all that i
can rememb with distinct is the splendour of the ey of which
i had caught some hint through her veil on the previou night oh thei
were wondrou those ey but i cannot tell their colour save that the
groundwork of them wa black moreov thei seem to be more than ey
as we understand them thei were inde window of the soul out of
which look thought and majesti and infinit wisdom mix with all the
allur and the mysteri that we ar accustom to see or to imagin
in woman
here let me sai someth at onc if thi marvel creatur expect
that the revel of her splendour wa go to make me her slave to
caus me to fall in love with her as it is call well she must have
been disappoint for it had no such effect it frighten and in a
sens humbl me that is all for i felt myself to be in the presenc
of someth that wa not human someth alien to me as a man which i
could fear and even ador as human would ador that which is divin
but with which i had no desir to mix moreov wa it divin or wa
it someth veri differ i did not know i onli knew that it wa not
for me as soon should i have thought of ask for a star to set within
my lantern
i think that she felt thi felt that her stroke had miss as the
french sai that is if she meant to strike at all at thi moment
of thi i am not certain for it wa in a chang voic on with a
suspicion of chill in it that she said with a littl laugh
do you admit now allan that a woman mai be old and still remain fair
and unwrinkl
i admit i answer although i wa trembl so much that i could
hardli speak with steadi that a woman mai be splendid and love
beyond anyth that the mind of man can conceiv whatev her ag of
which i know noth i would add thi ayesha that i thank you veri
much for have reveal to me the glori that is hid beneath your veil
why she ask and i thought that i detect curios in her
question
for thi reason ayesha now there is no fear of my troubl you in
such a fashion as you seem to dread a littl while ago as soon would
a man desir to court the moon sail in her silver loveli through
heaven
the moon it is strang that you should compar me to the moon she
said musingli do you know that the moon wa a great goddess in old
egypt and that her name wa isi andwel onc i had to do with isi
perhap you were there and knew it sinc more live than on ar given
to most of us i must search and learn for the rest all have not
thought as you do allan mani on the contrari love and seek to win
the divin
so do i at a distanc ayesha but to come too near to it i do not
aspir if i did perhap i might be consum
you have wisdom she repli not without a note of admir in her
voic the moth ar few that fear the flame but those ar the moth
which live also i think that you have scorch your wing befor and
learn that fire hurt inde now i rememb that i have heard of
three such fire of love through which you have flown allan though all
of them ar dead ash now or shine elsewher two burn in your youth
when a certain ladi di to save you a great woman that is it not so
and the third ah she wa fire inde though of a copper hue what wa
her name i cannot rememb but i think it had someth to do with the
wind ye with the wind when it wail
i stare at her wa thi mameena myth to be dug up again in a secret
place in the heart of africa and how the deuc did she know anyth
about mameena could she have been question han or umslopogaa no
it wa not possibl for she had never seen them out of my presenc
perhap she went on in a mock voic perhap onc again you
disbeliev allan whose cynic mind is so hard to open to new truth
well shall i show you the face of these three i can and she wave
her hand toward some object that stood on a tripod to the right of her
in the shadowit look like a crystal basin but what would it serv
when you who know them so well believ that i drew their pictur out
of your own soul also perchanc but on face would appear and that on
strang to you ladi ragnal perhapsjb
have you heard allan that among the wise some hold that not all of
us is visibl at onc here on earth within the same hous of flesh that
the whole self in it home abov separ itself into sundri part
each of which walk the earth in differ form a segment of life
circl that can never be dissolv and must unit again at last
i shook my head blankli for i had never heard anyth of the sort
you have still much to learn allan although doubtless there ar some
who think you wise she went on in the same mock voic well i
hold that thi doctrin is built upon a rock of truth also she ad
after studi me for a minut that in your case these three women
do not complet that circl i think there is a fourth who as yet is
strang to you in thi life though you have known her well enough in
other
i groan imagin that she allud to herself which wa foolish of
me for at onc she read my mind and went on with a rather acid littl
laugh
no no not the humbl slave who sit befor you whom as you have
told me it would pleas you to reject as unworthi were she brought to
you in offer as in the old dai wa done at the court of the great
king of the east o fool fool who hold yourself so strong and do not
know that if i chose befor yon shadow had move a finger breadth i
could bring you to my feet prai that you might be suffer to kiss
my robe ye just the border of my robe
then i beg of you not to choos ayesha sinc i think that when there
is work to be done by both of us we shall find more comfort side
by side than if i were on the ground seek to kiss a garment that
doubtless then it would delight you to snatch awai
at these word her whole attitud seem to chang i could see her
love shape brace itself up as it were beneath her robe and felt
in some wai that her mind had also chang that it had rid itself of
mockeri and woman piqu and like a shift searchlight wa direct
upon some new object
work to be done she repeat after me in a new voic ye i thank
you who bring it to my mind sinc the hour pass and that work press
also i think there is a bargain to be made between us who ar both of
the blood that keep bargain even if thei be not written on a roll
and sign and seal why do you come to me and what do you seek of
me allan watcherinthenight sai it and truthfulli for though i
mai laugh at li and pass them by when thei have to do with the etern
swordplai which natur decre between man and woman until these break
apart or cast down the sword seek arm in which thei agre too
well when thei have to do with polici and high purpos and ambit
end why then i aveng them upon the liar
now i hesit as what i had to tell her seem so foolish inde so
insan while she wait patient as though to give me time to shape my
thought speak at last becaus i must i said
i come to ask you ayesha to show me the dead if the dead still live
elsewher
and who told you allan that i could show you the dead if thei ar
not truli dead there is but on i think and if you ar hi messeng
show me hi token without it we do not speak togeth of thi
busi
what token i ask innoc though i guess her mean well
enough
she search me with her great ey for i felt and inde saw them on
me through the veil then answer
i thinknai let me be sure and half rise from the couch she bent
her heard over the tripod that i have describ and stare into what
seem to be a crystal bowl if i read aright she said straighten
herself present it is a hideou thing enough the carv of an
abort of a man such as no woman would care to look on lest her babe
should bear it stamp it is a charm thing also that ha virtu for
him who wear it especi for you allan sinc someth tell me
that it is dy with the blood of on who love you if you have it let
it be reveal sinc without it i do not talk with you of these dead
you seek
now i drew zikali talisman from it hidingplac and held it toward
her
give it to me she said
i wa about to obei when someth seem to warn me not to do so
nai i answer he who lent me thi carv for a while charg me
that except in emerg and to save other i must wear it night and
dai till i return it to hi hand sai that if i part from it
fortun would desert me i believ none of thi talk and tri to be rid
of it whereon death drew near to me from a snake such a snake as i see
you wear about you which doubtless also ha poison in it fang if of
anoth sort ayesha
draw near she said and let me look man be not afraid
so i rose from my chair and knelt befor her hope secretli that
no on would see me in that ridicul posit which the most
unsuspici might misinterpret i admit howev that it prove to
have compens sinc even through the veil i saw her marvel
ey better than i had done befor and someth of the pure outlin of
her classic face also the fragranc of her hair wa wonder
she took the talisman in her hand and examin it close
i have heard of thi charm and it is true that the thing ha power
she said for i can feel it run through my vein also that it is
a shield of defenc to him who wear it ye and now i understand what
perplex me somewhat name how it came about that when you vex me
into unveilingbut let that matter be the wisdom wa not your own but
anoth that is all ye the wisdom of on whose year have born
him beyond the shaft that fly from woman ey the ruinou shaft
which bring men down to doom and nothing tell me allan is thi
the like of him who gave it to you
ye ayesha the veri pictur as i think carv by himself though he
said that it is ancient and other tell that it ha been known in the
land for centuri
so perchanc ha he she answer drili sinc some of our compani
live long now tell me thi wizard name nai wait awhil for i would
prove that inde you ar hi messeng with whom i mai talk about the
dead and other thing allan you can read arab can you not
a littl i answer
then from a stool at her side she took paper or rather papyru and a
reed pen and on her knee wrote someth on the sheet which she gave to
me fold up
now tell me the name she said and then let us see if thei talli
with what i have written for if so you ar a true man not a mere
wander or a spy
the princip name of thi doctor ar zikali the openerofroad the
thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn i answer
read the write allan she said
i unfold the sheet and read arab word which meant weapon
cleaverofrock oneatwhomdogsbarkandchildrenwail
the last two ar near enough she said but the first is wrong
nai ayesha sinc in thi man tongu the word zikali mean
weapon intellig at which she clap her hand as a merri girl
might do the man i went on is without doubt a great doctor on
who see and know thing that other do not but i do not understand
why thi token carv in hi like should have power as you sai it
ha
becaus with it goe hi spirit allan have you never heard of the
egyptian a veri wise peopl who as i rememb declar that man ha
a ka or doubl a second self that can either dwell in hi statu or
be sent afar
i answer that i had heard thi
well the ka of thi zikali goe with that hideou imag of him which
is perhap why you have come safe through mani danger and why also i
seem to dream so much of him last night tell me now what doe zikali
want of me whose power he know veri well
an oracl the answer to a riddl ayesha
then set it out anoth time so you decid to see the dead and thi
old dwarf who is a home of wisdom desir an oracl from on who is
greater than he good and what ar you or both of you prepar to pai
for these boon know allan that i am a merchant who sell my favour
dear tell me then will you pai
i think that it depend upon the price i answer cautious set
out the price ayesha
be not afraid o cun dealer she mock i do not ask your soul
or even that love of your which you guard so jealous sinc these
thing i could take without the ask nai i ask onli what a brave and
honest man mai give without shame your help in war and perhap she
ad with a softer tone your friendship i think allan that i like
you well perhap becaus you remind me of anoth whom i knew long
ago
i bow at the compliment feel proud and pleas at the prospect of
a friendship with thi wonder and splendid creatur although i wa
awar that it had mani danger then i sat still and wait she also
wait brood
listen she said after a while i will tell you a stori and when you
have heard it you shall answer even if you do not believ it but not
befor doe it pleas you to listen to someth of the tale of my life
which i am move to tell you that you mai know with whom you have to
deal
again i bow think to myself that i knew noth that would pleas
me more who wa eaten up with a devour curios about thi woman
now she rose from her couch and descend off the dai began to walk
up and down the chamber i sai to walk but her movement were more
like the glide of an eagl through the air or the motion of a swan
upon still water so smooth were thei and graciou as she walk she
spoke in a low and thrill voic
listen she said again and even if my stori seem marvel to you
interrupt and abov all mock me not lest i should grow angri which
might be ill for you i am not as other women ar o allan who have
conquer the secret of natur here i felt an intens desir to ask
what secret but rememb and held my tongu to my sorrow have
preserv my youth and beauti through mani ag moreov in the past
perhap in payment for my sin i have live other live of which some
memori remain with me
by my last birth i am an arab ladi of royal blood a descend of the
king of the east there i dwelt in the wilder and rule a peopl
and at night i gather wisdom from the star and the spirit of the
earth and air at length i weari of it all and my peopl too weari
of me and besought me to depart for allan i would have naught to do
with men yet men went mad becaus of my beauti and slew each other out
of jealousi moreov other peopl made war upon my peopl hope to
take me captiv that i might be a wife to their king so i left them
and be furnish with great wealth in hoard gold and jewel
togeth with a certain holi man my master i wander through the
world studi the nation and their worship at jerusalem i tarri
and learn of jehovah who is or wa it god
at papho in the isl of chitim i dwelt a while till the folk of
that citi thought that i wa aphrodit return to earth and sought to
worship me for thi reason and becaus i made a mock of aphrodit i
who as i have said would have naught to do with men she through her
priest curs me sai that her yoke should lie more heavili upon my
neck from ag to ag than on that of ani woman who had breath beneath
the sun
it wa a wondrou scene she ad reflect that of the curs
sinc for everi word i gave back two moreov i told the hoari villain
of a highpriest to make report to hi goddess that long after she wa
dead in the world i would live on for the spirit of propheci wa on me
in that hour yet the curs fell in it season sinc in her dai doubt
it or not aphrodit had strength as inde under other name she ha
and will have while the world endur and for aught i know beyond it
do thei worship her now in ani land allan
no onli her statu becaus of their beauti though love is alwai
worship
ye who can testifi to that better than you yourself allan if he
who is call zikali tell me the truth concern you in the dream he
send as for the statu i saw some of them as thei left the master
hand in greec and when i told him that he might have found a better
model onc i wa that model if thi marbl still endur it must be
the most famou of them all though perchanc aphrodit ha shatter it
in her jealou rage you shall tell me of these statu afterward
mine had a mark on the left shoulder like to a mole but the stone wa
imperfect not my flesh as i can prove if you should wish
think it better not to enter on a discuss as to ayesha shoulder
i remain silent and she went on
i dwelt in egypt also and there to be rid of men who weari me with
their sigh and importun also to acquir more wisdom of which she
wa the mistress i enter the servic of the goddess isi queen
of heaven vow to remain virgin for ever soon i becam her
highpriestess and in her most sacr shrine upon the nile i commun
with the goddess and share her power sinc from me her daughter she
withheld none of her secret so it came about that though pharaoh held
the sceptr it wa i who rule egypt and brought it and sidon to their
fall it matter not how or why as it wa fate that i must do ye
king would come to seek counsel from me where i sat throne dress in
the garb of isi and breath out her power yet my task accomplish
of it all i grew weari as men will sure do of the heaven that thei
preach should thei chanc to find them
i wonder what thi task might be but onli ask why
becaus in their pictur heaven all thing lie to their hand and man
be man cannot be happi without struggl and woman be woman
without victori over other what is cheapli bought or given ha no
valu allan to be enjoi it must first be won but i bade you not to
break my thought
i ask pardon and she went on
then it wa that the shadow of the curs of aphrodit fell upon me
ye and of the curs of isi also so that these twin maledict have
made me what i am a lost soul dwell in the wilder wait the
fulfil of a fate whereof i know not the end for though i have all
wisdom all knowledg of the past and much power togeth with the gift
of life and beauti the futur is as dark to me as night without it
moon and star
hearken thi chanc to me though it be to my shame i tell it you
that all mai be clear at a templ of isi on the nile where i rule
there wa a certain priest a greek by birth vow like myself to the
servic of the goddess and therefor to wed none but her the goddess
herselfthat is in the spirit he wa name kallikr a man of
courag and of beauti such an on as those greek carv in the statu
of their god apollo never i think wa a man more beauti in face
and form though in soul he wa not great as often happen to men who
have all els and wellnigh alwai happen to women save myself and
perhap on or two other that histori tell of doubtless magnifi
their fabl charm
the pharaoh of that dai the last of the nativ blood him whom the
persian drove to doom had a daughter the princess of egypt amenarta
by name a fair woman in her fashion though somewhat swarthi in her
youth thi amenarta becam enamour of kallikr and he of her when
he wa a captain of the grecian mercenari at pharaoh court inde
she brought blood upon hi hand becaus of her wherefor he fled to
isi for forgiv and for peac thither in after time she follow
him and again urg her love
learn of the thing and know it for sacrileg i summon thi
priest and warn him of hi danger and of the doom which await him
should he continu in that path he grew affright he flung himself
upon the ground befor me with groan and supplic and kiss
my feet vow most fals to me that hi deal with the royal
amenarta were but a veil and that it wa i whom he worship hi
unhallow word fill me with horror and sternli i bade him begon and
do penanc for hi crime sai that i would prai the goddess on behalf
of him
he went leav me alon lost in thought in the darken shrine then
sleep fell on me and in my sleep i dream a dream or saw a vision
for suddenli there stood befor me a woman beauteou as myself clad in
noth save a golden girdl and a veil of gossam
o ayesha she said in a honei voic priestess of isi of the
egyptian sworn to the barren worship of isi and fed on the ash of
her unprofit wisdom know that i am aphrodit of the greek whom
mani time thou hast mock and defi and queen of the breath
world as isi is queen of the world that is dead now becaus thou
didst despis me and pour contempt upon my name i smite thee with
my strength and lai a curs upon thee it is that thou shalt love and
desir thi man who but now hath kiss thy feet ever long till the
world end to kiss hi lip in payment although thou art as far abov
him as the moon thou servest is abov the nile think not that thou
shalt escap my doom for know that howev strong the spirit here upon
the earth the flesh is stronger still and of all flesh i am the queen
then she laugh softli and smite me across the ey with a lock of
her scent hair wa gone
allan i awok from my sleep and a great troubl fell upon me for i
who had never love befor now wa rent with a rage of love and for thi
man who till that moment had been naught to me but as some beauteou
imag of gold and ivori i long for him my heart wa rack with
jealousi becaus of the egyptian who favour him an eat flame
possess my breast i grew mad there in the shrine of isi the divin
i cast myself upon my knee and cri to aphrodit to return and give me
him i sought for whose sake i would renounc all els even if i must
pour my wisdom into a beauteou empti cup ye thu i prai and lai
upon the ground and wept until outworn onc more sleep fell upon me
now in the dark of the holi place onc more there came a dream or
vision sinc befor me in her glori stood the goddess isi crown
with the crescent of the young moon and hold in her hand the jewel
sistrum that is her symbol from which came music like to the melodi
of distant bell she gaze at me and in her great ey were scorn and
anger
o ayesha daughter of wisdom she said in a solemn voic whom i
isi had come to look upon rather as a child than a servant sinc in
none other of my priestess wa such great to be found and whom
in a dai to be i had purpos to rais to the veri step of my heavenli
throne thou hast broken thine oath and forsak me hast worship
fals aphrodit of the greek who is mine enemi yea in the etern war
between the spirit and the flesh thou hast chosen the part of flesh
therefor i hate thee and add my doom to that which aphrodit laid upon
thee which hadst thou prai to me and not to her i would have lift
from thy heart
hearken the grecian whom thou hast chosen by aphrodit will thou
shalt love as the pathian said more thy love shall bring hi blood
upon thy hand nor mayest thou follow him to the grave for i will show
thee the sourc of life and thou shalt drink of it to make thyself more
fair even than thou art and thu outpac thy rival and when thy lover
is dead in a desol place thou shalt wait in grief and solitud till
he is born again and find thee there
yet shall thi be but the begin of thy sorrow sinc through all
time thou shalt pursu thy fate till at length thou canst draw up thi
man to the height on which thine own soul stand by the rope of love
and loss and suffer moreov through it all thou shalt despis
thyself which is man and woman hardest lot thou who have the
rare feast of spirit spread out befor thee hast chosen to fill thyself
from the trough of flesh
then allan in my dream i made a proud answer to the goddess sai
hear me mighti mistress of mani form who dost appear in all that
live an evil fate ha fallen upon me but wa it i who chose that
fate can the leaf contend against the drive gale can the fall
stone turn upward to the sky or when natur draw it can the tide
ceas to flow a goddess whom i have offend that goddess whose
strength caus the whole world to be ha laid her curs upon me and
becaus i have bent befor the storm as bend i must or break anoth
goddess whom i serv thou thyself mother isi hast ad to the
curs where then is justic o ladi of the moon
not here woman she answer yet far awai justic live and shall
be won at last and mayhap becaus thou art so proud and highstomach
it is laid upon thee to seek her blind ey through mani an ag yet
at last i think thou shalt set thy sin against her weight and find
the balanc even therefor ceas from question the high decre
of destini which thou canst not understand and be content to suffer
rememb that all joi grow from the root of pain moreov know
thi for thy comfort that the wisdom which thou hast shall grow and
gather on thee and with it thy beauti and thy power also that at the
last thou shalt look upon my face again in token whereof i leav to
thee my symbol the sistrum that i bear and with it thi command
follow that fals priest of mine wherev he mai go and aveng me upon
him and if thou lose him there wait while the gener pass till he
return again such and no other is thy destini
allan the vision fade and when i awok the light of dawn plai upon
the imag of the goddess in the sanctuari thei plai moreov
upon the holi jewel thing that in my dream her hand had held the
sistrum of her worship shape like the loop of life the magic symbol
that she had vow to me wherewith goe her power which henceforth wa
mine
i took it and follow after the priest kallikr to whom
thenceforward i wa bound by passion ti that ar stronger than all
the goddess in thi wide univers
here i allan could contain myself no longer and ask what for
then fear her wrath wish that i had been silent
but she wa not angri perhap becaus thi tale of her interview
with goddess doubtless fabl had made her humbl for she answer
quietli
by aphrodit or by isi or both of them i did not know all i knew
wa that i must seek him then and evermor as seek i do todai and
shall perchanc through on yet unborn so i follow as i wa taught
and command the sistrum be my guid how it matter not and
give me the mean and so at last i came to thi ancient land whereof
the ruin in which you sit wa onc known as kr
chapter xiv
allan miss opportun
all the while that she wa talk thu the ladi or the queen or the
witchwoman ayesha had been walk up and down the place from the
curtain to the foot of the dai sweep me with her scent robe as
she pass to and fro and as she walk she wave her arm as an orat
might do to emphasis the more move passag of her tale now at the
end of it or what i took to be the end she step on to the dai and
sank upon the couch as if exhaust though i think her spirit wa weari
rather than her bodi
here she sat awhil brood her chin rest on her hand then
suddenli look up and fix her glanc upon mefor i could see the
flash of it through her thin veilsaid
what think you of thi stori allan do you believ it and have you
ever heard it like
never i answer with emphasi and of cours i believ everi
word onli there ar on or two question that with your leav i would
wish to ask ayesha
by which you mean allan that you believ noth be by natur
without faith and doubt of all that you cannot see and touch and
handl well perhap you ar wise sinc what i have told you is not
all the truth for exampl it come back to me now that it wa not in
the templ on the nile or inde upon the earth that i saw the vision
of aphrodit and of isi but elsewher also that it wa here in kr
that i wa first consum by passion for kallikr whom hitherto i had
scorn in two thousand year on forget much allan out with your
question and i will answer them unless thei be too long
ayesha i said humbl reflect to myself that my question would
at ani rate be shorter than her vari tale even i who am not
learn have heard of these goddess of whom you speak of the grecian
aphrodit who rose from the sea upon the shore of cypru and dwelt at
papho and elsewher
ye doubtless like most men you have heard of her and perchanc also
have been struck across the ey with her hair like your better befor
you she interrupt with sarcasm
also i went on avoid argument i have heard of isi of the
egyptian ladi of the moon mother of mysteri spous of osiri whose
child wa horu the aveng
ay and i think will hear more of her befor you have done allan for
now someth come back to me concern you and her and anoth i
am not the onli on who ha broken the oath of isi and receiv her
curs allan as you mai find out in the dai to come but what of
these heavenli queen
onli thi ayesha i have been taught that thei were but phantasm
fabl by men with mani anoth fals divin and could have sworn
that thi wa true and yet you talk of them as real and live which
perplex me
be dull of understand doubtless it perplex you allan yet if
you had imagin you might understand that these goddess ar great
principl of natur isi of throne wisdom and strait virtu and
aphrodit of love as it is known to men and women who be human
have it laid upon them that thei must hand on the torch of life in their
littl hour also you would know that such principl can seem to take
shape and form and at certain ag of the world appear to their servant
visibl in majesti though perchanc todai other with chang name
wield their sceptr and work their will now you ar answer on thi
matter so to the next
privat i did not feel as though i were answer at all and i wa sure
that i know noth of the kind she indic but think it best to
leav the subject i went on
if i understood rightli ayesha the event which you have been pleas
first to describ to me and then to qualifi or contradict took place
when the pharaoh reign now no pharaoh ha sat upon the throne of
egypt for near two thousand year for the last wa a grecian woman whom
the roman conquer and drove to death and yet ayesha you speak as
though you have live all through that gulf of time and in thi there
must be error becaus it is imposs therefor i suppos you to mean
that thi histori ha come down to you in write or perhap in dream
i believ that even in such faroff time there were writer of romanc
and we all know of what stuff dream ar made at least thi thought
come to me i ad hurriedli fear lest i had said too much and
on so wise as you ar i repeat know well that a woman who sai she
ha live two thousand year must be mad orsuff from delus
becaus i repeat it is imposs
at these quit innoc remark she sprang to her feet in a rage that
might truli be call royal in everi sens
imposs romanc dream delus mad she cri in a ring
voic oh of a truth you weari me and i have a mind to send you
whither you will learn what is imposs and what is not inde i
would do it and now onli i need your servic and if i did there
would be none left for me to talk with sinc your companion is
moonstruck and the other ar but savag of whom i have seen enough
hearken fool noth is imposs why do you seek you who talk
of the imposs to girdl the great world in the span of your two
hand and to weigh the secret of the univers in the balanc of your
petti mind and of that which you cannot understand to sai that it is
not life you admit becaus you see it all about you but that it should
endur for two thousand year which after all is but a second beat in
the stori of the earth that to you is imposs although in truth
the buri seed or the sealedup toad can live as long doubtless also
you have some faith which promis you thi same boon to all etern
after the littl chang call death
nai allan it is possibl enough like to mani other thing of which
you do not dream todai that will be common to the ey of those who
follow after you mayhap you think it imposs that i should speak
with and learn of you from yonder old black wizard who dwell in the
countri whenc you came and yet whenev i will i do so in the night
becaus he is in tune with me and what i do shall be done by all men in
the year unborn ye thei shall talk togeth across the wide space
of the earth and the lover shall hear her lover voic although great
sea roll between them nor perchanc will it stop at thi perchanc in
futur time men shall hold convers with the denizen of the star and
even with the dead who have pass into silenc and the dark do you
hear and understand me
ye ye i answer feebli
you lie as you ar too prone to do you hear but you do not understand
nor believ and oh you vex me sore now i had it in my mind to
tell you the secret of thi long life of mine long mark you but not
endless for doubtless i must die and chang and return again like
other and even to show you how it mai be won but you ar not worthi
in your faithless
no no i am not worthi i answer who at that moment did not feel
the least desir to live two thousand year perhap with thi woman as
a neighbour rate me from gener to gener yet it is true
that now when i am older and a certain event cannot be postpon much
longer i do often regret that i neglect to take thi uniqu chanc
if in truth there wa on of prolong an exist which after all
ha it consolationsespeci when on ha made on pile certainli
it is a case a flagrant case of neglect opportun and my onli
consol for have lost them is that thi wa due to the upright
of my natur which made it so hard for me to acquiesc in altern
statement that i had everi caus to disbeliev and thu to give offenc
to a veri power and petul if attract ladi
so that is done with she went on with a littl stamp of indign
as soon you will be also who had you not cross and doubt me
might have live on for untold time and becom on of the master of the
world as i am
here she paus choke i think with her almost childish anger and
becaus i could not help it i said
such place and power if thei be your ayesha do not seem to bring
you much reward if i were a master of the world i do not think that i
should choos to dwell unchangingli among savag who eat men and in
a pile of ruin but perhap the curs of aphrodit and of isi ar
stronger master still and i paus inquiringli
thi bold argumentfor now i see that it wa boldseem to astonish
and even bewild my wonder companion
you have more wisdom than i thought she said reflect who have
come to understand that no on is realli lord of anyth sinc abov
there is alwai a more power lord who wither all hi pomp and pride
to nothing even as the great king learn in olden dai and i
who am higher than thei ar am learn now hearken troubl beset me
wherein i would have your help and that of your companion for which i
will pai each of you the fee that he desir the brood white man who
is with you shall free hi daughter and unharm though that he will
be unharm i do not promis the black savag captain shall fight hi
fill and gain the glori that he seek also someth that he seek
still more the littl yellow man ask noth save to be with hi
master like a dog and to satisfi at onc hi stomach and hi apish
curios you allan shall see those dead over whom you brood at
night though the other guerdon that you might have won is now pass
from your reach becaus you mock me in your heart
what must we do to gain these thing i ask how can we humbl
creatur help on who is all power and who ha gather in her
breast the infinit knowledg of two thousand year
you must make war under my banner and rid me of my foe as for the
reason listen to the end of my tale and you shall learn
i reflect that it wa a marvel thing that thi queen who claim
supernatur power should need our help in a war but think it wiser
to keep my medit to myself said noth as a matter of fact i
might just as well have spoken sinc as usual she read my thought
you ar think that it is strang allan that i the mighti and
undi should seek your aid in some petti tribal battl and so it
would be were my foe but common savag but thei ar more thei ar
men protect by the ancient god of thi immemori citi of kr a great
god in hi dai whose spirit still haunt these ruin and whose strength
still protect the worshipp who cling to him and practis hi unholi
rite of human sacrific
how wa thi god name i ask
rezu wa hi name and from him came the egyptian re or ra sinc in
the begin kr wa the mother of egypt and the conquer peopl of
kr took their god with them when thei burst into the vallei of the
nile and subdu it peopl long befor the first pharaoh mene wore
egypt crown
ra wa the sun wa he not i ask
ay and rezu also wa a sungod whom from hi throne in the fire of
the lord of dai gave life to men or slew them if he will with hi
thunderbolt of drought and pestil and storm he wa no gentl king
of heaven but on who demand bloodsacrific from hi worshipp
ye even that of maid and children so it came about that the peopl
of kr who saw their virgin slain and eaten by the priest of rezu
and their infant burn to ash in the fire that hi rai lit turn
themselv to the worship of the gentl moon the goddess whom thei
name lulala while some of them chose truth for their queen sinc
truth thei said wa greater and more to be desir than the fierc
sunk or even the sweet moonladi truth who sat abov them both
throne in the furthest star of heaven then the demon rezu grew
wroth and sent a pestil upon kr and it subject land and slew
their peopl save those who clung to him in the great apostasi and
with them some other who serv lulala and truth the divin that
escap i know not how
did you see thi great pestil i ask much interest
nai it befel gener befor i came to kr on juni a priest
wrote a record of it in the cave yonder where i have my home and where
is the buryingplac of the countless thousand that it slew in my
dai kr of which should you desir to hear it i will tell you the
histori wa a ruin as it is now though scatter in the land amidst
the tumbl stone which onc built up her subject citi a peopl
name the amahagg dwelt in household or tribe and there sacrif
men by fire and devour them follow the rite of the demon rezu
for these were the descend of those who escap the pestil also
there were certain other children of the worshipp of lulala whose
kingdom is the moon and of truth the queen who clung to the gentl
worship of their forefath and were ever at war with the follow of
rezu
what brought you to kr ayesha i ask irrelevantli
have i not said that i wa led hither by the command and the symbol of
great isi whom i serv also she ad after a paus that i might
find a certain pair on of whom had broken hi oath to her tempt
thereto by the other
and did you find them ayesha i ask
ay i found them or rather thei found me and in my presenc
the goddess execut her decre upon her fals priest and drove hi
temptress back to the world
that must have been dread for you ayesha sinc i understood that
you alsolik thi priest
she sprang from her couch and in a low hiss voic which resembl
the sound made by an angri snake and turn my blood cold to hear
exclaim
man do you dare to mock me nai you ar but a blunder curiou
fool and it is well for you that thi is so sinc otherwis like
kallikr never should you leav kr live ceas from seek that
which you mai not learn suffic it for you to know that the doom of
isi fell upon the lost kallikr her priest forsworn and that on me
also fell her doom who must dwell here dead yet live till he return
again and the plai begin afresh
stranger she went on in a softer voic perchanc your faith
whateer it be parad a hell to terrifi it worshipp and give
strength to the arm of it prophesi priest who swear thei hold
the kei of doom or of the etern joi i see you sign assent i had
nod at her extrem accur guess and therefor can understand
that in such a hell as thi here upon the earth i have dwelt for some
two thousand year expiat the crime of power abov me whereof i
am but the hand and instrument sinc those power which decre that i
should love decre also that i must aveng that love
she sank down upon the couch as though exhaust by emot of which
i could onli guess the reason hide her face in her hand present
she let them fall again and continu
of these woe ask me no more thei sleep till the hour of their
resurrect which i think draw nigh inde i thought that you
perchancebut let that be twa near the mark nearer allan than
you know not in it therefor leav them to their sleep as i would if
i mightah if i might whose companion thei ar throughout the weari
ag ala that through the secret which wa reveal to me i remain
undi on the earth who in death might perhap have found a rest
and be human although half divin must still busi myself with the
affair of earth
look you wander after that which wa fate had happen and i
remain in my agoni of solitud and sorrow after too i had drunk
of the cup of endur life and like the prometheu of old fabl found
myself bound to thi changeless rock whereon dai by dai the vultur
of remors tear out my live heart which in the watch of the night is
ever doom to grow again within my woman breast i wa plung into
petti troubl of the flesh ay and welcom them becaus their irk at
time gave me forget when the savag dweller in thi land came
to know that a mighti on had arisen among them who wa the servant of
the ladi of the moon those of them who still worship their goddess
lulala gather themselv about me while those of them who worship
rezu sought to overthrow me
here thei said is the goddess lulala come to earth in the name
of rezu let us slai her and make an end for these fool thought that i
could be kill allan i conquer them but their captain who also
is name rezu and whom thei held and hold to be an eman of the god
himself walk the earth i could not conquer
why not i ask
for thi reason allan in some past ag hi god show him the same
secret that wa shown to me he too had drunk of the cup of life and
live on unharm by time so that be in strength my equal no spear
of mine can reach hi heart clad in the armour of hi evil god
then what spear can i inquir helplessli who wa bewild
none at all allan yet an ax mai as you shall hear or so i
think for mani gener there ha been peac of a sort between the
worshipp of lulala who dwell with me in the plain of kr or rather
of myself sinc to these peopl i am lulala and the worshipp of
rezu who dwell in the stronghold beyond the mountain crest but of
late year their chief rezu have devast the land about ha
grown restless and threaten to attack on kr which is not strong
enough to stand against him moreov he ha sought for a white queen to
rule under him purpos to set her up to mock my majesti
is that why those cannib carri awai the daughter of my companion
the seacaptain who is name aveng i ask
it is allan sinc present he will give it out that i am dead or
fled if he ha not done so alreadi and that thi new queen ha arisen
in my place therebi he hope to draw awai mani who cling to me er he
advanc upon kr carri with him thi girl veil as i am so that
none mai know the differ between us sinc not a man of them ha
ever look upon my face allan therefor thi rezu must die if die he
can otherwis although it is imposs that he should harm me he mai
slai or draw awai my peopl and leav me with none to rule in thi
place where by the decre of fate i must dwell on until he whom i seek
return you ar think in your heart that such savag would be
littl loss and thi is so but still thei serv as slave to me in my
loneli moreov i have sworn to protect them from the demon rezu
and thei have trust in me and therefor my honour is at stake for
never shall it be said that those who trust in shewhocommand were
overthrown becaus thei put faith in on who wa powerless
what do you mean about an ax ayesha i ask why can an ax alon
kill rezu
the thing is a mysteri o allan of which i mai not tell you all sinc
to do so i must reveal secret which i have determin you shall not
learn suffic it to you to know that when thi rezu drank of the cup
of life he took with him hi ax now thi ax wa an ancient weapon
rumour to have been fashion by the god and as it chanc that ax
drew to itself more and stronger life than did rezu how it doe not
matter if inde the tale be more than a fabl at least thi i know is
true for he who guard the gate of life a certain noot a master of
mysteri and mine also in my dai of youth who be a philosoph and
veri wise chose never to pass that portal which wa open to him said
it to me himself er he went the wai of flesh he told thi rezu
also that now he had naught to fear save hi own ax and therefor he
counsel him to guard it well sinc if it wa lift against him in
anoth hand it would bring him down to death which noth
els could do like to the heel of achil whereof the great homer
singshav you read homer allan
in a translat i answer
good then you will rememb the stori like to the heel of achil
i sai that ax would be the onli gate by which death could enter hi
invulner flesh or rather it alon could make the gate
how did noot know that i ask
i cannot sai she answer with irrit perchanc he did not know
it perchanc it is all an idl tale but at least it is true that rezu
believ and believ it and what a man believ is true for him and
will certainli befal if it were otherwis what is the us of faith
which in a thousand form support our race and hold it from the
horror of the pit onli those who believ noth inherit what thei
believenoth allan
it mai be so i repli prosaic but what happen about the
ax
in the end it wa lost or as some sai stolen by a woman whom rezu had
desert and therefor he walk the world in fear from dai to dai nai
ask no more empti question i had open my mouth to speak but hear
the end of the tale in my troubl concern rezu i rememb thi
wild legend of the ax and sinc when lost in a forest everi path that
mai lead to safeti should be explor i sent my wisdom forth to make
inquiri concern it as i who am great have the power to do of
certain who ar in tune with me throughout thi wide land of africa
amongst other i inquir of that old wizard whom you name zikali
open of road and he gave me an answer that there live in hi land a
certain warrior who rule a tribe call the peopl of the ax by right
of the ax of which ax none not even he knew the begin or the
legend on the chanc though it wa a small on i bade the wizard
send that warrior here with hi ax last night he stood befor me and i
look upon him and the ax which at least is ancient and ha a stori
whether it be the same that rezu bore i do not know who never saw it
yet perchanc he who bear it now is prepar to hold it aloft in battl
even against rezu though he be terribl to see and then we shall
learn
oh ye i answer he is quit prepar for that is hi natur
also among thi man peopl the holder of the ax is thought to be
unconquer
yet some must have been conquer who held it she repli musingli
well you shall tell me that tale later now we have talk long and
you ar weari and astonish go eat and rest yourself tonight when
the moon rise i will come to where you ar not befor for i have much
that must be done and show you those with whom you must fight against
rezu and make a plan of battl
but i do not want to fight i answer who have fought enough and
came here to seek wisdom not bloodsh
first the sacrific then the reward she answer that is if ani
ar left to be reward farewel
chapter xv
robertson is lost
so i went and wa conduct by billali the old chamberlain for such
seem to be hi offic who had been wait patient without all thi
while back to our resthous on my wai i pick up han whom i found
sit outsid the arch and found that as usual that worthi had been
keep hi ey and ear open
baa he said did the white witch tell you that there is a big
impi encamp over yonder outsid the hous in what look like a
great dry ditch and on the edg of the plain beyond
no han but she said that thi even she would show us those in
whose compani we must fight
well baa thei ar there some thousand of them for i crept through
the broken wall like a snake and saw them and baa i do not think
thei ar men i think that thei ar evil spirit who walk at night
onli
why han
becaus when the sun is high baa as it is now thei ar all
sleep ye there thei lie ab fast asleep as other peopl do at
night with onli a few sentri out on guard and these ar yawn and
rub their ey
i have heard that there ar folk like that in the middl of africa
where the sun is veri hot han i answer which perhap is why
shewhocommand is go to take us to see them at night also these
peopl it seem ar worshipp of the moon
no baa thei ar worshipp of the devil and that white witch is hi
wife
you had better keep your thought to yourself han for whatev she
is i think that she can read thought from far awai as you guess last
night therefor i would not have ani if i were you
no baa or if i must think henceforth it shall be onli of gin which
in thi place is also far awai he repli grin
then we came to the resthous where i found that robertson had alreadi
eaten hi middai meal and like the amahagg gone to sleep while
appar umslopogaa had done the same at least i saw noth of him
of thi i wa glad sinc that wondrou ayesha seem to draw vital
out of me and after my long talk with her i felt veri tire so i too
at and then went to lie down under an old wall in the shade at a littl
distanc and to reflect upon the marvel thing that i had heard
here be it said at onc that i believ noth of them or at least
veri littl inde all the involv tale of ayesha long life i
dismiss at onc as incred clearli she wa some beauti woman
who wa more or less mad and suffer from megalomania probabl an
arab who had wander to thi place for reason of her own and becom
the chieftai of a savag tribe whose tradit she had absorb and
reproduc as person experi again for reason of her own
for the rest she wa now threaten by anoth tribe and know that
we had gun and could fight from what happen on the yesterdai wish
natur enough for our assist in the come battl as for the
marvel chief rezu or rather for hi supernatur attribut and all
the cockandbul stori about an axewel it wa humbug like the rest
and if she believ in it she must be more foolish than i took her
to beeven if she were unhing on certain point for the rest her
inform about myself and umslopogaa doubtless had reach her from
zikali in some obscur fashion as she herself acknowledg
but heaven how beauti she wa that flash of loveli when out of
piqu or coquetri she lift her veil blind like the lightn but
thank good also like the lightn it frighten instinct on
felt that it wa veri danger even to death and with it i for on
wish no closer acquaint fire mai be love and attract also
comfort at a proper distanc but he who sit on the top of it is
cremat as mani a moth ha found
so i argu know well enough all the while that if thi particular
humanor inhumanfir desir to make an holocaust of me it could do
so easili enough and that in realiti i ow my safeti so far to a lack
of that desir on it part the gloriou ayesha saw noth to attract
her in an insignific and wither hunter or at ani rate in hi
exterior though with hi mind she might find some small affin
moreov to make a fool of him just for the fun of it would not
serv her purpos sinc she need hi assist in a busi that
necessit clear wit and unprejud judgment
lastli she had declar herself to be absorb in some tiresom
complic with anoth man of which it wa rather difficult to
follow the detail it is true that she describ him as a handsom but
somewhat emptyhead person whom she had last seen two thousand year
ago but probabl thi onli meant that she thought poorli of him becaus
he had prefer some other woman to herself while the two thousand
year were ad to the tale to give it atmospher
the worst of scandal becom romant and even respect in two
thousand year wit that of cleopatra with csar mark antoni and
other gentlemen the most virtuou read of cleopatra with sympathi even
in boardingschool and it is felt that were she by some miracl to be
blot out of the book of histori the loss would be enorm the same
appli to helen phryne and other bad lot in fact now that on come
to think of it most of the attract personag in histori male or
femal especi the latter were bad lot when we find someon to
whose name is ad the good we skip no doubt ayesha be veri
clever appreci thi regrett truth and therefor move her
murki entangl of the past decad or so back for a coupl of
thousand year as mani of us would like to do
there remain the veri curiou circumst of her appar
correspond with old zikali who live far awai thi howev after
all wa not inexplic in the cours of a great deal of experi i
have observ that all the witchdoctor famili to which doubtless she
belong have strang mean of commun
in most instanc these ar no doubt physic carri on by help of
messeng or messag pass from on to the other but sometim it
is reason to assum what is known as telepathi as their link of
intercours between two such highli develop expert as ayesha and
zikali it might for the sake of argument safe be suppos that it
wa thu thei learn each other mind and cooper in each other
project though perhap thi end wa effect by common method
whatev it interpret the issu of the busi seem to be
that i wa to be let in for more fight well in ani case thi could
not be avoid sinc robertson daughter inez had to be save at all
cost if it could possibl be done even if we lost our live in the
attempt therefor fight we must so there wa noth more to be said
also without doubt thi adventur wa particularli interest and i
could onli hope that good luck or zikali great medicin or rather
provid would see me through it safe
for the rest the fact that our help wa necessari to her in thi
warlik ventur show me clearli enough that all thi wonder
woman pretens to supernatur power were the sheerest nonsens
had thei been otherwis she would not have need our help in her tribal
fight notwithstand the rubbish she talk about the chief rezu
who accord to her account of him must resembl on of the fabul
troll halfhuman and halfghostli evil creatur of whom i have
read in the nors saga who could onli be slain by some particular hero
arm with a particular weapon
reflect thu i went to sleep and did not wake until the sun wa
set find that han wa also sleep at my feet just like a
faith dog i woke him up and we went back togeth to the resthous
which we reach as the dark fell with extraordinari swift as
it doe in those latitud especi in a place surround by cliff
not find robertson in the hous i conclud that he wa somewher
outsid possibl make a reconnaiss on hi own account and told
han to get supper readi for both of us while he wa do so by aid
of the amahagg lamp umslopogaa suddenli appear in the circl of
light and look about him said
where is redbeard macumazahn
i answer that i did not know and wait for i felt sure that he had
someth to sai
i think that you had better keep redbeard close to you macumazahn
he went on thi afternoon when you had return from visit the
white doctoress and have eaten had gone to sleep under the wall
yonder i saw redbeard come out of the hous carri a gun and a bag
of cartridg hi ey roll wildli and he turn first thi wai and
then that snif at the air like a buck that scent danger then he
began to talk aloud in hi own tongu and as i saw that he wa speak
with hi spirit as those do who ar mad i went awai and left him
why i ask
becaus as you know macumazahn it is a law among us zulu never to
disturb on who is mad and engag in talk with hi spirit moreov
had i done so probabl he would have shot me nor should i have
complain who would have thrust myself in where i had no right to be
then why did you not come to call me umslopogaa
becaus then he might have shot you for as i have seen for some time
he is inspir of heaven and know not what he doe upon the earth
think onli of the ladi sadey who ha been stolen awai from him as
is but natur so i left him walk up and down and when i return
later to look saw that he wa gone as i thought into thi wall hut
now when hansi tell me that he is not here i have come to speak to you
about him
no certainli he is not here i said and i went to look at the bed
where robertson slept to see if it had been us that even
then for the first time i saw ly on it a piec of paper torn from a
pocketbook and address to myself i seiz and read it it ran thu
the merci lord ha sent me a vision of inez and shown me where she
is over the cliffedg awai to the west also the road to her in
my sleep i heard her talk to me she told me that she is in great
dangerthat thei ar go to marri her to some bruteand call to
me to come at onc and save her ye and to come alon without sai
anyth to anyon so i am go at onc dont be frighten or
troubl about me all will be well all will be quit well i will tell
you the rest when we meet
horrorstruck i translat thi insan screed to umslopogaa and han
the former nod grave
did i not tell you that he wa talk with hi spirit macumazahn i
had render the merci lord as the good spirit well he ha gone
and doubtless hi spirit will take care of him it is finish
at ani rate we cannot baa broke in han who i think fear that i
might send him out to look for robertson i can follow most spoor but
not on such a night as thi when on could cut the black into lump
and build a wall of it
ye i answer he ha gone and noth can be done at present
though to myself i reflect that probabl he had not gone far and would
be found when the moon rose or at ani rate on the follow morn
still i wa most uneasi about the man who as i had note for a long
while wa lose hi balanc more and more the shock of the barbar
and dread slaughter of hi halfbre children and of the abduct
of inez by these grim maneat savag began the busi and i
think that it wa increas and accentu by hi sudden convers to
complet temper after year of heavi drink
when i persuad him to thi cours i wa veri proud of myself think
that i had done a clever thing but now i wa not so sure perhap it
would have been better if he had continu to drink someth at
ani rate for a while but the troubl is that in such case there is
gener no halfwai hous a man or still more a woman given to thi
frailti either turn aggress sober or remain veri drunken at
ani rate even if i had made a mess of it i had act for the best and
could not blame myself
for the rest it wa clear that in hi new phase the religi
associ of hi youth had reassert themselv with remark
vigour for i gather that he had been brought up almost as a
calvinist and in the rush of their return had overset hi equilibrium
as i have said he prai night and dai without ani of those reserv
which most peopl prefer in their religi exercis and when he
talk of matter outsid our quest hi convers gener revolv
round the devil or hell and it torment which to sai the truth did
not make him a cheer companion inde in thi respect i like him
much better in hi old unregener dai be i fear myself a
somewhat worldli soul
well the sum of it wa that the poor fellow had gone mad and given us
the slip and as han said to search for him at onc in that dark
wa imposs inde even if it had been lighter i do not think that
it would have been safe among these amahagg nightbird whom i did not
trust certainli i could not have ask han to undertak the task and
if i had i do not think he would have gone sinc he wa afraid of the
amahagg therefor there wa noth to be done except wait and hope
for the best
so i wait till at last the moon came and with it ayesha as she had
promis clad in a rich dark cloak she arriv in some pomp herald
by billali follow by women also cloak and surround by a guard
of tall spearmen i wa seat outsid the hous smoke when suddenli
she arriv from the shadow and stood befor me
i rose respectfulli and bow while umslopogaa goroko and the other
zulu who were with me gave her the royal salut and han cring like
a dog that is afraid of be kick
after a swift glanc at them as i guess by the motion of her veil
head she seem to fix her gaze upon my pipe that evid excit
her curios and ask me what it wa i explain as well as i could
expati on the charm of smoke
so men have learn anoth useless vice sinc i left the world and
on that is filthi also she said snif at the smoke and wave her
hand befor her face whereon i drop the pipe into my pocket where
be alight it burnt a hole in my best remain coat
i rememb the remark becaus it show me what a clever actress she wa
who to keep up her charact of antiqu pretend to be astonish
at a habit with which she must have been well acquaint although i
believ that it wa unknown in the ancient world
you ar troubl she went on swiftli chang the subject i read
it in your face on of your compani is miss who is it ah i see
the white man you name aveng where is he gone
that is what i wish to ask you ayesha i said
how can i tell you allan who in thi place lack ani glass into which
to look for thing that pass afar still let me try and press her
hand to her forehead she remain silent for perhap a minut then
spoke slowli
i think that he ha gone over the mountain lip toward the worshipp
of rezu i think that he is mad sorrow and someth els which i do
not understand have turn hi brain someth that ha to do with the
heaven i think also that we shall recov him live if onli for a
littl while though of thi i cannot be sure sinc it is not given to
me to read the futur but onli the past and sometim the thing that
happen in the present though thei be far awai
will you send to search for him o ayesha i ask anxious
nai it is useless for he is alreadi distant moreov those who went
might be taken by the outpost of rezu as perchanc ha happen to
your companion wander in hi mad do you know what he went to
seek
more or less i answer and translat to her the letter that
robertson had left for me
it mai be as the man write she comment sinc the mad often see
well in their dream though these ar not sent by a god as he imagin
the mind in it secret place know all thing o allan although it
seem to know littl or noth and when the breath of vision or the
furi of a soul distraught blow awai the veil or burn through the
gate of distanc then for a while it see and learn sinc whatev
fool mai think often mad is true wisdom now follow me with the
littl yellow man and the warrior of the ax stai let me look upon
that ax
i interpret her wish to umslopogaa who held it out to her but refus
to loos it from hi wrist to which it wa attach by the leathern
thong
doe the black on think that i shall cut him down with hi own weapon
i who am so weak and gentl she ask laugh
nai ayesha but it is hi law not to part with thi drinker of live
which he name chieftai and groanmak and cling to closer by
dai and night than a man doe to hi wife
there he is wise allan sinc a savag captain mai get more wive but
never such anoth ax the thing is ancient she ad musingli after
examin it everi detail and who know it mai be that whereof the
legend tell which is fate to bring rezu to the dust now ask thi
fierceei slayer whether arm with hi ax he can find courag to
face the most terribl of all men and the strongest on who is a wizard
also of whom it is prophesi that onli by such an ax as thi can he
be made to bite the dust
i obei umslopogaa laugh grimli and answer
sai to the white witch that there is no man live upon the earth whom
i would not face in war i who have never been conquer in fair fight
though onc a chanc blow brought me to the door of death and he
touch the great hole in hi forehead sai to her also that i have no
fear of defeat i from whom doom is as i think still far awai though
the openerofroad ha told me that among a strang peopl i shall die
in war at last as i desir to do who from my boyhood have live in
war
he speak well she answer with a note of admir in her voic
by isi were he but white i would set him to rule these amahagg
under me tell him allan that if he lai rezu low he shall have a
great reward
and tell the white witch macumazahn umslopogaa repli when i had
translat that i seek no reward save glori onli and with it the
sight of on who is lost to me but with whom my heart still dwell if
inde thi witch ha strength to break the wall of black that is
built between me and her who is gone down
strang reflect ayesha when she understood that thi grim
destroy should yet be bound by the silken bond of love and yearn for
on whom the grave ha taken learn from it allan that all human
is cast in the same mould sinc my long and your long ar hi
also though the three of us be far apart as ar the sun and the moon
and the earth and as differ in everi other qualiti yet it is true
that sun and moon and earth ar born of the same black womb of chao
therefor in the begin thei were ident as doubtless thei will
be in the end when their journei done thei rush togeth to light
space with a flame at which the mock god that made them mai warm
their hand well so it is with men allan whose soulstuff is drawn
from the gulf of spirit by natur hand and cast upon the cold air of
thi deathdriven world freez into a million shape each differ to
the other and yet be sure the same now talk no more but follow me
slave thi wa address to billali bid the guard lead on to the
camp of the servant of lulala
so we went through the silent ruin ayesha walk or rather glide a
pace or two ahead then came umslopogaa and i side by side while at
our heel follow han veri close at our heel sinc he did not wish
to be out of reach of the virtu of the great medicin and incident
of the protect of ax and rifl
thu we march surround by the solemn guard for someth between
a quarter and half a mile till at length we climb the debri of a
mighti wall that onc had encompass the citi and by the moonlight saw
beneath us a vast hollow which clearli at some unknown time had been the
bed of an enorm moat and fill with water
now howev it wa dry and all about it surfac were dot numer
campfir round which men were move also some women who appear to
be engag in cook food at a littl distanc too upon the
further edg of the moatlik depress were a number of whiterob
individu gather in a circl about a larg stone upon which
someth wa stretch that resembl the carcas of a sheep or goat
and round these a great number of spectat
the priest of lulala who make sacrific to the moon as thei do night
by night save when she is dead said ayesha turn back toward
me as though in answer to the queri which i had conceiv but left
unutt
what struck me about the whole scene wa it extraordinari anim and
brisk all the folk round the fire and outsid of them move about
quickli and with the same kind of liveli which might anim a camp
of more natur peopl at the rise of the sun it wa as though thei
had just got up full of vigour to commenc their daili or rather their
nightli round which in truth wa the case sinc as han discov
by habitud these amahagg prefer to sleep dure the dai unless
someth prevent them and to carri on the activ of life at
night it onli remain to add that there seem to be a great number
of them for their fire follow the round of the dry moat stretch
further than i could see
scrambl down the crumpl wall by a zigzag pathwai we came upon the
outpost of the armi beneath us who challeng then see with whom
thei had to do fell flat upon their face leav their great spear
which had iron spike on their shaft like to those of the masai
stick in the ground besid them
we pass on between some of the fire and i note how solemn and
gloomi although handsom were the counten of the folk by whom
these were surround inde thei look like denizen of a differ
world to our on alien to the kindli race of men there wa noth
social about these amahagg who seem to be a peopl labour under
some ancient ancestr curs of which thei could never shake off
the memori even the women rare smile their clearcut state
counten remain stern and set except when thei glower at us
incuri onli when ayesha pass thei prostrat themselv like the
rest
we went on through them and across the moat climb it further slope
and here suddenli came upon a host of men gather in a hollow squar
appar in order to receiv us thei stood in rank of five or six
deep and their spearpoint glimmer in the moonlight look like
long band of level steel as we enter the open side of the squar all
these spear were lift thrice thei were lift and at each uplift
there rose a deepthroat cry of hiya which is the arab for she
and i suppos wa a salut to ayesha
she swept on take no heed till we came to the centr of the squar
where a number of men were gather who prostrat themselv in the
usual fashion motion to them to rise she said
captain thi veri night within two hour we march against rezu and
the sunworshipp sinc otherwis as my art tell me thei march
against us shewhocommand is immort as your father have known
from gener to gener and cannot be destroi but you her
servant can be destroi and rezu who also ha drunk of the cup of
life outnumb you by three to on and prepar a queen to set up in
my place over hi own peopl and such of you as remain as though
she ad with a contemptu laugh ani woman of a dai could take my
place
she paus and the spokesman of the captain said
we hear o hiya and we understand what wouldst thou have us do
o lulalacometoearth the armi of rezu ar great and from the
begin he ha hate thee and us also hi magic is as thy magic and
hi length of dai as thy length of dai how then can we who ar few
three thousand men at the most match ourselv against rezu son of
the sun would it not be better that we should accept the term of rezu
which ar light and acknowledg him as our king
as she heard these word i saw the tall shape of ayesha quiver beneath
her robe as i think not with fear but with rage becaus the mean
of them wa clear enough name that rather than risk a battl with
rezu these peopl were contempl surrend and her own deposit
if inde she could be depos still she answer in a quiet voic
it seem that i have dealt too gentli with you and with your father
children of lulala whose shadow i am here upon the earth so that
becaus you onli see the scabbard you have forgotten the sword within
and that it can shine forth and smite well why should i be wrath
becaus the brutish will follow the law of brute though it be true
that i am mind to slai you where you stand hearken were i less
merci i would leav you to the clutch hand of rezu who would
drag you on by on to the stone of sacrific and there offer up your
heart to hi god of fire and devour your bodi with hi heat but i
bethink me of your wive and children and of your forefath whom i
knew in the dead dai and therefor if i mai i still would save you
from yourselv and your head from the glow pot
take counsel togeth now and saywil you fight against rezu or will
you yield if that is your desir speak it and by tomorrow sun i
will begon take these with me and she point to us whom i have
summon to help us in the war ay i will begon and when you ar
stretch upon the stone of sacrific and your women and children ar
the slave of the men of rezu then shall you cry
oh where is hiya whom our father knew oh will she not return and
save us from thi hell
ye so shall you cry but there shall come no answer sinc then she
will have depart to her own habit in the moon and thenc appear
no more now consult togeth and answer swiftli sinc i weari of you
and your wai
the captain drew apart and began to talk in low voic while ayesha
stood still appar quit unconcern and i consid the
situat
it wa obviou to me that these peopl were almost in rebellion against
their strang ruler whose power over them wa of a pure moral natur
on that eman from her person alon what i wonder wa be
what she seem to be why she thought it worth while to exercis it at
all then i rememb her statement that here and nowher els she must
abid for some secret reason until a certain mystic gentleman with
a greek name came to fetch her awai from thi appoint rendezv
therefor i suppos she had no choic or rather suffer as she did
from hallucin believ herself to have no choic and wa oblig
to put up with a crowd of disagre savag in quarter which were
sadli out of repair
present the spokesman return salut with hi spear and ask
if we go up to fight against rezu who will lead us in the battl o
hiya
my wisdom shall be your guid she answer thi white man shall be
your gener and there stand the warrior who shall meet rezu face to
face and bring him to the dust and she point to umslopogaa lean
upon hi ax and watch them with a contemptu smile
thi repli did not seem to pleas the man for he withdrew to consult
again with hi companion after a debat which i suppos wa anim
for the amahagg men of few word who did not indulg in oratori all
of them advanc on us and the spokesman said
the choic of a gener doe not pleas us hiya we know that the
white man is brave becaus of the fight he made against the men of rezu
over the mountain yonder also that he and hi follow have weapon
that deal death from afar but there is a propheci among us of which
none know the begin that he who command in the last great battl
between lulala and rezu must produc befor the ey of the peopl of
lulala a certain holi thing a charm of power without which defeat will
be the portion of lulala of thi holi thing thi spirithaunt shape
of power we know the like and the fashion for these have come down
among our priest though who told it to them we cannot tell but of it
i will sai thi onli that it speak both of the spirit and the bodi of
man and yet of more than man
and if thi wondrou charm thi talisman of might cannot be shown by
the white lord here what then ask ayesha coldli
then hiya thi is the word of the peopl of lulala that we will not
serv under him in the battl and thi also is their word that we will
not go up against rezu that thou art mighti we know well hiya
also that thou canst slai if thou wilt but we know also that rezu is
mightier and that against him thou hast no power therefor kill us if
thou dost so desir until thy heart is satisfi with death for it
is better that we should perish thu than upon the altar of sacrific
wear the redhot crown of rezu
so sai we all exclaim the rest of the compani when he had finish
the thought come to me to begin to satisfi my heart with thy coward
blood and that of thy companion said ayesha contemptu then she
paus and turn to me ad o watcherbynight what counsel is
there aught that will convinc these chickenheart on over whom i
have spread my feather for so long
i shook my head blankli whereat thei murmur togeth and made as
though thei would go
then it wa that han who understood someth of arab as he did of
most african tongu pull my sleev and whisper in my ear
the great medicin baa show them zikali great medicin
here wa an idea the descript of the articl requir a
spirithaunt shape of power that spoke both of the spirit and the
bodi of man and yet of more than man wa so vagu that it might mean
anyth or noth and yet
i turn to ayesha and prai her to ask them if what thei want should
be produc whether thei would follow me brave and fight rezu to the
death she did so and with on voic thei repli
ay brave and to the death him and the bearer of the ax of whom
also our legend tell
then with deliber i open my shirt and hold out the imag of
zikali as far as the chain of eleph hair would allow i ask
is thi the holi thing the charm of power of which your legend tell
o peopl of the amahagg and worshipp of lulala
the spokesman glanc at it then snatch a brand from a watchfir
that burnt near by held it over the carv and stare and stare
again and as he did so did the other bend over him
dog would you sing my beard i cri in affect rage and seiz
the brand from hi hand i smote him with it over the head
but he took no heed of the affront which i had offer to him mere
to assert my author still for a few moment he stare although the
spark from the wood were frizzl in hi greasi hair then of a sudden
went down on hi face befor me as did all the other and cri out
it is the holi thing it is the spirithaunt shape of power itself
and we the worshipp of lulala will follow thee to the death o white
lord watcherbynight ye where thou goest and he goe who bear the
ax thither will we follow till not on of us is left upon hi feet
then that settl i said yawn sinc it is never wise to show
concern about anyth befor savag inde person i had no wish
to be the leader of thi veri peculiar tribe in an adventur of which i
knew noth and therefor had hope that thei would leav that honour
to someon els then i turn and told umslopogaa what had pass a
tale at which he onli shrug hi great shoulder handl hi ax as
though he were mind to try it edg upon some of these darklov
as he name the amahagg peopl becaus of their nocturn habit
meanwhil ayesha gave certain order then she came to me and said
these men march at onc three thousand strong and by dawn will camp
on the northern mountain crest at sunris litter will come to bear you
and those with you if thei will to join them which you should do by
middai in the afternoon marshal them as you think wise for the battl
will take place in the small hour of the follow morn sinc the
peopl of lulala onli fight at night i have said
do you not come with us i ask dismai
nai not in a war against rezu why it matter not yet my spirit will
go with you for i shall watch all that pass how it matter not
and perchanc you mai see it therei know not on the third dai from
tomorrow we shall meet again in the flesh or beyond it but as i think
in the flesh and you can claim the reward which you journei here to
seek a place shall be prepar for the white ladi whom rezu would have
set up as a rival queen to me farewel and farewel also to yonder
bearer of the ax that shall drink the blood of rezu also to the littl
yellow man who is rightli name lightindark as you shall learn
er all is done
then befor i could speak she turn and glide awai swiftli surround
by her guard leav me astonish and veri uncomfort
chapter xvi
allan vision
the old chamberlain billali conduct us back to our camp as we went
he discours to me of these amahagg of whom it seem he wa himself
a develop specimen on who threw back perhap ten of gener
to some superior ancestor who live befor thei becam debas in
substanc he told me that thei were a wild and lawless lot who live
amongst ruin or in cave or some of them in swamp dwell in
small separ commun each govern by it petti headman who wa
gener a priest of their goddess lulala
origin thei and the peopl of rezu were the same in time when thei
worship the sun and the moon jointli but thousand of year ago
as he express it thei had separ the rezuit have gone to
dwell to the north of the great mountain whenc thei continu
threaten the lulalait whom had it not been for shewhocommand
thei would have destroi long befor the rezuit it seem were
habitu cannib wherea the lulalait branch of the amahagg onli
practis cannib occasion when by a lucki chanc thei got hold
of stranger such as yourself watcherbynight and your companion
he ad with mean if their crime were discov howev hiya
shewhocommand punish it by death
i ask if she exercis an activ rule over these peopl he answer
that she did not as she lack suffici interest in them onli when
she wa angri with individu she would destroi some of them by her
art as she had power to do if she chose most of them inde had
never seen her and onli knew of her exist by rumour to them she wa
a spirit or a goddess who inhabit the ancient tomb that lai to the
south of the old citi whither she had come becaus of the threaten war
with rezu whom alon she fear he did not know why he told me again
moreov that she wa the greatest magician who had ever been and
that it wa certain she did not die sinc their forefath knew her
gener ago still she seem to be under some curs like the
amahagg themselv who were the descend of those who had onc
inhabit kr and the countri round it as far as the seacoast and
for hundr of mile inland have been a mighti peopl in their dai
befor a great plagu destroi them
for the rest he thought that she wa a veri unhappi woman who live
with her own soul mourn the dead and consort with none upon the
earth
i ask him why she stai here whereat he shook hi head and repli
he suppos becaus of the curs sinc he could conceiv of no other
reason he inform me also that her mood vari veri much sometim
she wa fierc and activ and at other by comparison mild and
lowspirit just now she wa pass through on of the latter stage
perhap becaus of the rezu troubl for she did not wish her peopl to
be destroi by thi terribl person or perhap for some other reason
with which he wa not acquaint
when she chose she knew all thing except the distant futur thu
she knew that we were come also the detail of our march and that
we should be attack by the rezuit who were go out to meet
their return compani that had been sent afar to find a white queen
therefor she had order him to go with soldier to our assist i
ask why she went veil and he repli becaus of her beauti which
drove even savag men mad so that in old dai she had been oblig to
kill a number of them
that wa all he seem to know about her except that she wa kind to
those who serv her well like himself and protect them from evil of
everi sort
then i ask him about rezu he answer that he wa a dread person
undi it wa said like shewhocommand though he had never seen
the man himself and never want to do so hi follow be cannib
and have liter eaten up all those that thei could reach were now
desir of conquer the peopl of lulala that thei might eat them
also at their leisur each other thei did not eat becaus dog doe not
eat dog and therefor thei were begin to grow hungri although thei
had plenti of grain and cattl of which thei us the milk and hide
as for the come battl he knew noth about it or what would happen
save that shewhocommand said that it would go well for the lulalait
under my direct she wa so sure that it would go well that she did
not think it worth while to accompani the armi for she hate nois and
bloodsh
it occur to me that perhap she wa afraid that she too would be
taken captiv and eaten but i kept my reflect to myself
just then we arriv at our camphous where billali bade me farewel
sai that he wish to rest as he must be back at dawn with litter
when he hope to find us readi to start then he depart umslopogaa
and han also went awai to sleep leav me alon who have taken my
repos in the afternoon did not feel drowsi at the moment so love
wa the night inde that i made up my mind to take a littl walk dure
the midnight hour after the manner of the amahagg themselv for
have now been recognis as generalissimo of their forc i had
littl fear of be attack especi as i carri a pistol in my
pocket so off i set stroll slowli down what seem to have been
a main street of the ancient citi which in it gener appear
resembl excav pompeii onli on an infinit larger scale
as i went i medit on the strang circumst in which i found
myself realli thei tempt me to believ that i wa suffer from
delus and perhap all the while in fact lai stretch upon a bed
in the delirium of fever that marvel woman for instanceeven
reject her tale of miracul extend life which i didwhat wa
i to make of her i did not know except that wondrou as she wa
it remain clear that she claim a great deal more power than she
possess thi wa evid from her tone in the interview with the
captain and from the fact that she had shuffl off the command of her
tribe on to my shoulder if she were so mighti why did she not command
it herself and bring her celesti or infern power to bear upon the
enemi again i could not sai but on fact emerg name that she
wa as interest as she wa beauti and uncommonli clever into the
bargain
but what a task wa thi that she had laid upon me to lead into battl
with a foe of unascertain strength a mob of savag probabl quit
undisciplin of whose fight qualiti i knew noth and whom i had
no opportun of organis the affair seem mad and i could onli
hope that luck or destini would take me through somehow
to tell the truth i believ it would for i had grown almost as
superstiti about zikali and hi great medicin as wa han himself
certainli the effect of it upon those captain wa veri odd or would
have been had not the explan come to me in a flash on the first
night of our meet as i have describ i show thi talisman to
ayesha as a kind of letter of credenti and now i could see that
it wa she who had arrang all the scene with the captain or their
tribal magician in order to get her wai about my appoint to the
command
everyth about her conduct bore thi out even her feign ignor
of the exist of the charm and the leav of it to han to
suggest it product which perhap she did by influenc hi mind
subconsci no doubt more or less it fit in with on of those
nebul tradit which ar so common amongst ancient savag race
and therefor onc shown to her confeder or confeder would be
accept by the common peopl as a holi sign after which the rest wa
easi
such an obviou explan involv the death of ani illus i might
still cherish about thi arab ladi ayesha and it is true that i part
with them with regret as we all do when we think we have discov
someth wonder in the femal line but there it wa and to bother
ani more about her her histori and aim seem useless
so dismiss her and all present anxieti from my mind i began to
look about me and to wonder at the marvel scene which unfold
itself befor me in the moonlight that i might see it better although
i wa rather afraid of snake which might hide among the stone by
an easi ascent i climb a mount of ruin and up the broad slope of a
tumbl massiv wall which from it thick i judg must have been
that of some fort or templ on the crest of thi wall some seventi or
eighti feet abov the level of the street i sat down and look about
me
everywher around me stretch the ruin of the great citi now as
fallen and as desert as babylon herself the majest loneli
of the place wa someth aw even the vision of compani and
battalion of men cross the plain toward the north with the
moonlight glisten on their spearpoint did littl to lessen thi
sens of loneli i knew that these were the regiment which i wa
destin to command travel to the camp where i must meet them but
in such silenc did thei move that no sound came from them even in the
deathli still of the perfect night so that almost i wa tempt to
believ them to be the shadowghost of some armi of old kr
thei vanish and muse thu i think i must have doze at ani rate it
seem to me that of a sudden the citi wa as it had been in the dai
of it glori i saw it brilliant with a hundr colour everywher wa
colour on the paint wall and roof the flower tree that line
the street and the bright dress of the men and women who by thousand
crowd them and the mart and squar even the chariot that move to
and fro were colour as were the countless banner which float from
palac wall and templ top
the enorm place teem with everi activ of life bride be
born to marriag and dead men to burial squadron march clad
in glitter armour merchant chaffer whiterob priest and
priestess pass in process who or what did thei worship i
wonder children break out of school grave philosoph debat
in the shadow of a cool arcad a royal person make a progress
preced by runner and surround by slave and lastli the multitud
of citizen go about the daili busi of life
even detail were visibl such as those of offic of the law chase
an escap prison who had a broken rope ti to hi arm and a
collis between two chariot in a narrow street about the wreck of
which an idl mob gather as it doe todai if two vehicl collid
while the owner argu gesticul angrili and the polic and
groom tri to lift a fallen hors on to it feet onli no sound of the
argument or of anyth els reach me i saw and that wa all the
silenc remain intens as well it might do sinc those chariot must
have come to grief thousand upon thousand of year ago
a cloud seem to pass befor my ey a thin gauzi cloud which somehow
remind me of the veil that ayesha wore inde at the moment although
i could not see her i would have sworn that she wa present at my side
and what is more that she wa mock me who had set her down as so
impot a trickstress which doubtless wa part of the dream
at ani rate i return to my normal state and there about me were the
mile of desol street and the thousand of broken wall and the
black blot of roofless hous and the wide unten plain bound by
the battlement line of encircl mountain crest and abov all the
great moon shine softli in a tender sky
i look and thrill though oppress by the drear and desol beauti
of the scene around me descend the wall and the ruin slope and made
my wai homeward afraid even of my own shadow for i seem to be the
onli live thing among the dead habit of immemori kr
reach our camp i found han awak and watch for me
i wa just come to look for you baa he said inde i should
have done so befor onli i knew that you had gone to pai a visit to
that tall white missi who ti up her head in a blanket and thought
that neither of you would like to be disturb
then you thought wrong i answer and what is more if you had made
that visit i think it might have been on from which you would never
have come back
oh ye baa snigger han the tall white ladi would not have
mind it is you who ar so particular after the fashion of men whom
heaven made veri shy
without deign to repli to the gibe of han i went to lie down
wonder what kind of a bed poor robertson occupi that night and
soon fell asleep as fortun for myself i have the power to do
whatev my circumst at the moment men who can sleep ar those who
do the work of the world and succe though person i have had more
of the work than of the success
i wa awaken at the first grei dawn by han who inform me that
billali wa wait outsid with litter also that goroko had alreadi
made hi incant and doctor umslopogaa and hi two men for war
after the zulu fashion when battl wa expect he ad that these
zulu had refus to be left behind to guard and nurs their wound
companion and said that rather than do so thei would kill them
somehow he inform me in what wai he could not guess thi had come
to the ear of the white ladi who hid her face from men becaus it wa
so ugli and she had sent women to attend to the sick on with
word that thei should be well care for all of thi prove to be true
enough but i need not enter into the detail
in the end off we went i in my litter follow billali with an
express and a repeat rifl and plenti of ammunit for both and
han also well arm in that which had been sent for umslopogaa who
prefer to walk with goroko and the two other zulu
for a littl while han enjoi the sensat of be carri by
somebodi els and lai upon the cushion smoke with a seraph smile
and address sarcast remark to the bearer who fortun did not
understand them soon howev he weari of these novel delight and
as he wa still determin not to walk until he wa oblig climb on
to the roof of the litter astrid of which he sat as though it were
a hors look for all the world like a toi monkei on a horizont
stick
our road ran across the level fertil plain but a small portion of
which wa cultiv though i could see that at some time or other
when it popul wa greater everi inch of it had been under crop
now it wa larg cover by tree mani of them fruitbear
between which meander stream of water which onc i think had been
irrig channel
about ten oclock we reach the foot of the encircl cliff and began
the climb of the escarp which wa steep tortuou and difficult
by noon we reach it crest and here found all our littl armi encamp
and except for the sentri sleep as seem to be the invari
custom of these peopl in the daytim
i caus the chief captain to be awaken and with them made a circuit
of the camp reckon the number of the men which came to about 3250
and learn what i could concern them and their wai of fight
then accompani by umslopogaa and han with the zulu as a guard
also by three of the headcaptain of the amahagg i walk forward to
studi the lie of the land
come to the further edg of the escarp i found that at thi place
two broadbas ridg shape like those that spring from the bole of
certain tropic forest tree ran from it crest to the plain beneath
at a gentl slope moreov i saw that on thi plain between the end
of the ridg an armi wa encamp which by the aid of my glass i
examin and estim to number at least ten thousand men
thi armi the amahagg captain inform me wa that of rezu who
thei said intend to commenc hi attack at dawn on the follow
morn sinc the peopl of rezu be sunworshipp would never
fight until their god appear abov the horizon have studi all
there wa to see i ask the captain to set out their plan of battl
if thei had a plan
the chief of them answer that it wa to advanc halfwai down the
righthand ridg to a spot where there wa a narrow flat piec of
ground and there await attack sinc at thi place their smaller
number would not so much matter wherea these made it imposs for
them to assail the enemi
but suppos that rezu should choos to come up to the other ridg and
get behind you what would happen then i inquir
he repli that he did not know hi idea of strategi be it wa
clear of a primit order
do your peopl fight best at night or in the dai i went on
he said undoubtedli at night inde in all their histori there wa no
record of their have done so in the daytim
and yet you propos to let rezu join battl with you when the sun is
high or in other word to court defeat i remark
then i went asid and discuss thing for a while with umslopogaa and
han after which i return and gave my order declin all argument
briefli these were that in the dusk befor the rise of the moon our
amahagg must advanc down the righthand ridg in complet silenc
and hide themselv among the scrub which i saw grew thickli near it
root a small parti howev under the leadership of goroko whom i
knew to be a brave and clever captain wa to pass halfwai down the
lefthand ridg and there light fire over a wide area so as to make
the enemi think that our whole forc had encamp there then at the
proper moment which i had not yet decid upon we would attack the armi
of rezu
the amahagg captain did not seem pleas with thi plan which i think
wa too bold for their fanci and began to murmur togeth see that
i must assert my author at onc i walk up to them and said to
their chief man
hearken my friend by your own wish not mine i have been appoint
your gener and i expect to be obei without question from the moment
that the advanc begin you will keep close to me and to the black on
and if so much as on of your men hesit or turn back you will
die and i nod toward the ax of umslopogaa moreov afterward
shewhocommand will see that other of you die should you escap in
the fight
still thei hesit thereon without anoth word i produc zikali
great medicin and held it befor their ey with the result that the
sight of thi ugli thing did what even the threat of death could not do
thei went flat on the ground everi on of them and swore by lulala
and by shewhocommand her priestess that thei would do all i said
howev mad it seem to them
good i answer now go back and make readi and for the rest by
thi time tomorrow we shall know who is or is not mad
from that moment till the end i had no more troubl with these
amahagg
i will get on quickli with the stori of thi fight whereof the
preliminari detail do not matter at the proper time goroko went off
with two hundr and fifti men and on of the two zulu to light the
fire and at an agre signal name the fire of two shot in rapid
success by myself to begin shout and gener make as much nois
as thei could
we also went off with the remain three thousand and befor the moon
rose crept as quietli as ghost down the righthand ridg be such
a silent folk who were accustom to move at night and could see in
the dark almost as well as cat the amahagg execut thi manoeuvr
splendidli wrap their spearblad in band of dry grass lest light
should glint on them and betrai our movement so in due cours we came
to the patch of bush where the ridg widen out about five hundr
yard from the plain beneath and there lai down in four compani or
regiment each of them about seven hundr and fifti strong
now the moon had risen but becaus of the mist which cover the
surfac of the plain we could see noth of the camp of rezu which we
knew must be within a thousand yard of us unless inde it had been
move as the silenc seem to suggest
thi circumst gave me much anxieti sinc i fear lest abandon
their reput habit these rezuit were also contempl a night
attack umslopogaa too wa disturb on the subject though becaus
of goroko and hi men whose fire began to twinkl on the oppos ridg
someth over a mile awai thei could not pass up there without our
knowledg
still for aught i knew there might be other wai of scale thi
mountain i did not trust the amahagg who declar that none exist
sinc their local knowledg wa slight as thei never visit these
northern slope becaus of their fear of rezu suppos that the enemi
gain the crest and suddenli assault us in the rear the thought of
it made me feel cold down the back
while i wa wonder how i could find out the truth han who wa
squat behind a bush suddenli rose and gave the rifl he wa carri
to the remain zulu
baa he said i am go to look and find out what those peopl ar
do if thei ar still there and then you will know how and when to
attack them dont be afraid for me baa it will be easi in that mist
and you know i can move like a snake also if i should not come back it
doe not matter and it will tell you that thei ar there
i hesit who did not wish to expos the brave littl hottentot to
such risk but when he understood umslopogaa said
let the man go it is hi gift and duti to spy as it is mine to smite
with the ax and your to lead macumazahn let him go i sai
i nod my head and have kiss my hand in hi silli fashion in
token of much that he did not wish to sai han slip out of sight
sai that he hope to be back within an hour except for hi great
knife he went unarm who fear that if he took a pistol he might be
tempt to fire it and make a nois
chapter xvii
the midnight battl
that hour went by veri slowli again and again i consult my watch by
the light of the moon which wa now rise high in the heaven and
thought that it would never come to an end listen as i would there wa
noth to be heard and as the mist still prevail the onli thing
i could see except the heaven wa the twinkl of the fire lit by
goroko and hi parti
at length it wa done and there wa no sign of han anoth half hour
pass and still no sign of han
i think that lightindark is dead or taken prison said
umslopogaa
i answer that i fear so but that i would give him anoth fifteen
minut and then if he did not appear i propos to order an advanc
hope to find the enemi where we had last seen them from the top of the
mountain
the fifteen minut went by also and as i could see that the amahagg
captain who sat at a littl distanc were get veri nervou i
pick up my doublebarrel rifl and turn round so that i face
up hill with a view of fire it as had been agre with goroko but in
such a fashion that the flash perhap would not be seen from the plain
below for thi purpos i move a few yard to the left to get behind
the trunk of a tree that grew there and wa alreadi lift the rifl
to my shoulder when a yellow hand clasp the barrel and a huski voic
said
dont fire yet baa as i want to tell you my stori first
i look down and there wa the ugli face of han wear a grin that
might have frighten the man in the moon
well i said with cold indiffer assum i admit to hide my
excess joi at hi safe return tell on and be quick about it i
suppos you lost your wai and never found them
ye baa i lost my wai for the fog wa veri thick down there but in
the end i found them all right by my nose baa for those maneat
peopl smell strong and i got the wind of on of their sentri it wa
easi to pass him in the mist baa so easi that i wa tempt to cut
hi throat as i went but i didnt for fear lest he should make a nois
no i walk on right into the middl of them which wa easi too for
thei were all asleep wrap up in blanket thei hadnt ani fire
perhap becaus thei didnt want them to be seen or perhap becaus it
is so hot down in that low land i dont know which
so i crept on take note of all i saw till at last i came to a littl
hill of which the top rose abov the level of the mist so that i could
see on it a long hut built of green bough with the leav still fresh
upon them now i thought that i would crawl up to the hut sinc it came
into my mind that rezu himself must be sleep there and that i might
kill him but while i stood hesit i heard a nois like to that made
by an old woman whose husband had thrown a blanket over her head to keep
her quiet or to that of a bee in a bottl a sort of drone nois that
remind me of someth
i thought a while and rememb that when red beard wa on hi knee
prai to heaven as is hi habit when he ha noth els to do baa
he make a nois just like that i crept toward the sound and present
there i found red beard himself ti upon a stone and look as mad as
a buffalo bull stuck in a swamp for he shook hi head and roll hi
ey about just as though he had had two bottl of bad gin baa and
all the while he kept sai prayer now i thought that i would cut him
loos and bent over him to do so when by illluck he saw my face and
began to shout sai
go awai you yellow devil i know you have come to take me to hell
but you ar too soon and if my hand were loos i would twist your head
off your shoulder
he said thi in english baa which as you know i can understand quit
well after which i wa sure that i had better leav him alon whilst
i wa think there came out of the hut abov two old men dress in
nightshirt such as you white peopl wear with yellow thing upon
their head that had a metal pictur of the sun in front of them
medicinemen i suggest
ye baa or predik of some sort for thei were rather like
your reverend father when he dress himself up and went into a box to
preach see them i slip back a littl wai to where the mist began
lai down and listen thei look at red beard for hi shout at me
had brought them out but he took no notic of them onli went on make
a nois like a beetl in a tin can
it is noth said on of the predik to the other in the same
tongu that these amahagg us but when is he to be sacrif soon
i hope for i cannot sleep becaus of the nois he make
when the edg of the sun appear not befor answer the other
predik then the new queen will be brought out of the hut and thi
white man will be sacrif to her
i think it is a piti to wait so long said the first predik for
never shall we sleep in peac until the redhot pot is on hi head
first the victori then the feast answer the second predik
though he will not be so good to eat as that fat young woman who wa
with the new queen
then baa thei both smack their lip and on of them went back
toward the hut but the other did not go back no he sat down on the
ground and glower at baa redbeard upon the stone more he struck
him on the face to make him quiet
now baa when i saw thi and rememb that thei had said that thei
had eaten jane whom i like although she wa such a fool the spirit in
me grew so veri angri and i thought that i would give thi old skellum
ie rascal of a predik a tast of sacrific himself after which i
purpos to creep to the hut and see if i could get speech with the ladi
sadey if she wa there
so i wriggl up behind the predik as he sat glower over
redbeard and stuck my knife into hi back where i thought it would
kill him at onc but it didnt baa for he fell on to hi face and
began to make a nois like a wound hyena befor i could finish him
then i heard a sound of shout and to save my life wa oblig to run
awai into the mist without loos redbeard or see ladi sadey
i ran veri hard baa make a wide circl to the left and so at last
got back here that all baa
and quit enough too i answer though if thei did not see you
the death of the medicineman mai frighten them poor jane well i
hope to come even with those devil befor thei ar three hour older
then i call up umslopogaa and the amahagg captain and told them
the substanc of the stori also that han had locat the armi or part
of it
the end of it wa that we made up our mind to attack at onc inde
i insist on thi as i wa determin if i could to save that
unfortun man robertson who from han account evid wa now
quit mad and rave so i fire the two shot as had been arrang
and present heard the sound of distant shout on the slope of
the oppos ridg a few minut later we start umslopogaa and i
lead the vanguard and the amahagg captain follow with the three
remain compani
now the reader presum the exist of such a person will think
that everyth is sure to go right that thi cun old fellow allan
quatermain is go to surpris and wipe the floor with those rezuit
who were alreadi beguil by the trick he had instruct goroko to plai
that after thi he will rescu robertson who doubtless shortli recov
hi mind also inez with the greatest eas in fact that everyth will
happen as it ought to do if thi were a romanc instead of a mere record
of remark fact but be the latter as it happen matter did
not work out quit in thi conveni wai
to begin with when those amahagg told me that the rezuit never
fought in the dark or befor the sun wa well up either thei li or
thei were much mistaken for at ani rate on thi occas thei did the
exact contrari all the while that we thought we were stalk them
thei were stalk us the goroko manoeuvr had not deceiv them in the
least sinc from their spi thei knew it exact signific
here i mai add that those spi were in our own rank traitor in
short who were realli in the pai of rezu and possibl belong to hi
abomin faith some of whom slip awai from time to time to the
enemi to report our progress and plan so far as thei knew them
further what han had stumbl on wa a mere rear guard left around the
place of sacrific and the hut where inez wa confin the real armi he
never found at all that wa divid into two bodi and hidden in bush
to the right and left of the ridg which we were descend just at the
spot where it join the plain beneath and into the jaw of these two
armi we march gaili
now that hypothet reader will sai why didnt that silli old fool
allan think of all these thing why didnt he rememb that he wa
command a pack of savag with whom he had no real acquaint
among whom there were sure to be traitor especi as thei were of
the same blood as the rezuit and take precaut
ah my dear reader i will onli answer that i wish you had handl the
job yourself and enjoi the opportun of see what you could do
in the circumst do you suppos i didnt think of all these point
of cours i did but have you ever heard of the difficulti of make
silk purs out of sow ear or of turn a lot of gloomi and
disagre barbarian whom you had never even drill into
trustworthi and effici soldier readi to fight three time their own
number and beat them
also i beg to observ that i did get through somehow as you shall
learn which is more than you might have done mr wisdom though i
admit not without help from anoth quarter it is all veri well for
you to sit in your armchair and be sapient and turn up your learn
nose like the gentlemen who criticis plai and poem an easi job
compar to the write of them from all of which howev you
will understand that i am to tell the truth rather asham of what
follow sinc qui sexcus saccus
as we slunk down that hill in the moonlight a queerlook crowd i
admit also that i felt veri uncomfort to begin with i did not like
that remark of the medicineman which han report to the effect that
the feast must come after the victori especi as he had said just
befor that robertson wa to be sacrif as the sun rose which would
seem to suggest that the victori wa plan to take place befor that
event
while i wa rumin upon thi subject i look round for han to
crossexamin him as to the priest exact word onli to find that he
had slunk off somewher a few minut later he reappear run back
toward us swiftli and i notic take shelter behind tree trunk and
rock as he came
baa he gasp for he wa out of breath be care those rezu men
ar on either side ahead i went forward and ran into them thei threw
mani spear at me look and he show a slight cut on hi arm from
which blood wa flow
instantli i understood that we were ambush and began to think veri
hard inde as it chanc we were pass across a larg flat space
upon the ridg sai seven or eight acr in extent where the bush grew
lightli though ow to the soil be better the tree were tall
on the steep slope below thi littl plain it seem to be denser and
there it wa accord to han that the ambush wa set i halt my
regiment and sent back messeng to the other that thei were to halt
also as thei came up on the pretext of give them a rest befor thei
were marshal and we advanc to the battl
then i told umslopogaa what han said and ask him to send out hi
zulu soldier whom he could trust to see if he could obtain confirm
of the report thi he did at onc also i ask him what he thought
should be done suppos that it wa true
form the amahagg into a ring or a squar and await attack he
answer
i nod for that wa my own opinion but repli
if thei were zulu the plan would be good but how do we know that
these men will stand
we know noth macumazahn and therefor can onli try if thei run it
must be uphil
then i call the captain and told them what wa toward which seem
to alarm them veri much inde on or two of them want to retreat at
onc but i said i would shoot the first man who tri to do so in
the end thei agre to my plan and said that thei would post their best
soldier abov at the top of the squar with the order to stop ani
attempt at a flight up the mountain
after thi we form up the squar as best we could arrang it in
a rather rough fourfold line while we were do thi we heard some
shout below and present the zulu return who report that all
wa as han had said and that rezu men were move round us have
discov as he thought that we had halt and escap their ambush
still the attack did not develop at onc for the reason that the rezu
armi wa crawl up the steep flank of the spur on either side of the
level piec of ground with a view of encircl us altogeth so as
to make a clean sweep of our forc as a matter of fact consid from
our point of view thi wa a most fortun move sinc therebi thei
stop ani attempt at a retreat on the part of our amahagg whose
bolthol wa now block
when we had done all we could we sat down or at least i did and
wait the night i rememb wa strang still onli from the slope
on either side of our plateau came a kind of rustl sound which
in fact wa caus by the feet of rezu peopl as thei march to
surround us
it ceas at last and the silenc grew complet so much so that i could
hear the teeth of some of our tall amahagg chatter with fear a
sound that gave me littl confid and caus umslopogaa to remark
that the heart of these big men had never grown thei remain as
those of babi i told the captain to pass the word down the rank
that those who stood might live but those who fled would certainli die
therefor if thei wish to see their home again thei had better stand
and fight like men otherwis most of them would be kill and the rest
eaten by rezu thi wa done and i observ that the messag seem to
produc a steadi effect upon our rank
suddenli all around us from below from abov and on either side there
broke a most aw roar which seem to shape itself into the word
rezu and next minut also from abov below and either side some ten
thousand men pour forth upon our squar
in the moonlight thei look veri terribl with their flow white
robe and great gleam spear han and i fire some shot though
for all the effect thei produc we might as well have pelt a breaker
with pebbl then as i thought that i should be more us aliv than
dead i retreat within the squar umslopogaa hi zulu and han
come with me
on the whole our amahagg stood the attack better than i expect thei
beat back the first rush with consider loss to the enemi also the
second after a longer struggl then there wa a paus dure which we
reform our rank drag the wound men into the squar
scarc had we done thi when with anoth mighti shout of rezu the
enemi attack againthat wa about an hour after the battl had begun
but now thei had chang their tactic for instead of try to rush
all side of the squar at onc thei concentr their effort on the
western front that which face toward the plain below
on thei came and among them in the forefront of the battl now and
again i caught sight of a gigant man a huge creatur who seem to me
to be seven feet high and big in proport i could not see him clearli
becaus of the uncertain moonlight but i note hi fierc aspect also
that he had an enorm beard black streak with grei that flow
down to hi middl and that hi hair hung in mass upon hi shoulder
rezu himself i shout to umslopogaa
ay macumazahn rezu himself without doubt and i rejoic to see him
for he will be a worthi foe to fight look he carri an ax as i do
now i must save my strength for when we come face to face i shall need
it all
i thought that i would spare umslopogaa thi exert and watch my
opportun to put a bullet through thi giant but i could never get
on onc when i had cover him an amahagg rush in front of my gun
so that i could not shoot and when a second chanc came a littl cloud
float over the face of the moon and made him invis after that i
had other thing to which to attend sinc as i expect would happen
the western face of our squar gave and yell like devil the enemi
began to pour in through the gap
a cold thrill went through me for i saw that the game wa up to reform
these undisciplin amahagg wa imposs noth wa to be expect
except panic rout and slaughter i curs my folli for ever have had
anyth to do with the busi while han scream to me in a thin
voic that the onli chanc wa for us three and the zulu to bolt and
hide in the bush
i did not answer him becaus apart from ani nasti pride the thing wa
imposs for how could we get through those struggl mass of men
which surround us on everi side no my clock had struck so i went on
make a kind of mental sandwich of prayer and curs prayer for
my soul and forgiv for my sin and curs on the amahagg and
everyth to do with them especi zikali and the woman call
ayesha who between them had led me into thi affair
perhap the great medicin of zikali pipe han again as he fire a
rifl at the advanc foe
hang the great medicin i shout back and ayesha with it no
wonder she declin to take a hand in thi busi
as i spoke the word i saw old billali who not be a man of war wa
keep as close to us as he could go flat onto hi vener face and
reflect that he must have got a thrown spear through him cast a
hurri glanc at him to see if he were done for or onli wound out
of the corner of my ey i caught sight of someth diaphan which
gleam in the moonlight and remind me of i knew not what at the
moment
i look round quickli to see what it might be and lo there almost at
my side wa the veil ayesha herself hold in her hand a littl rod
made of black wood inlaid with ivori not unlik a field marshal baton
or a sceptr
i never saw her come and to thi dai i do not know how she did so she
wa just there and what is more she must have put lumin paint or
someth els on her robe for thei gleam with a sort of faint
phosphoresc fire which in the moonlight made her conspicu all
over the field of battl nor did she speak a singl word she onli
wave the rod point with it toward the fierc hord who were
draw near to us kill as thei came and began to move forward with
a glide motion
now from everi side there went up a roar of shewhocommand
shewhocommand while the peopl of rezu in front shout lulala
lulala fly lulala is upon us with the witchcraft of the moon
she move forward and by some strang impuls for no order wa given
we all began to move after her ye the rank that a minut befor were
begin to give wai to wild panic becam fill with a marvel
courag and move after her
the men of rezu also and i suppos with them rezu himself for i saw no
more of him at that time began to move uncommonli fast over the edg
of the plateau toward the plain beneath in fact thei broke into flight
and leap over dead and dy we rush after them alwai follow
the gleam robe of ayesha who must have been an extrem agil
person sinc without ani appar exert she held her place a few
step ahead of us
there wa anoth curiou circumst about thi affair name that
terrifi though thei were those rezuit after the first break soon
seem to find it imposs to depart with speed thei kept turn
round to look behind them at that follow vision as though thei were
so mani of lot wive moreov the same fate overtook mani of them
which fell upon that scriptur ladi sinc thei appear to becom
petrifi and stood there quit still like rabbit fascin by a
snake until our peopl came up and kill them
thi slai went on all down the last steep slope of the ridg on
which i suppos at least twothird of the armi of rezu must have
perish sinc our amahagg show themselv veri handi men when it
came to extermin foe who were too terrorstruck to fight and
exhilar by the occup gain courag everi moment
chapter xviii
the slai of rezu
at last we were on the plain the bemus remnant of rezu armi still
doubl befor us like a mob of game pursu by wild dog here we
halt to reform our rank it seem to me although still she spoke
no word that some order reach me from the gleam ayesha that
i should do thi the busi took twenti minut or so and then
number about two thousand five hundr strong for the rest had
fallen in the fight of the squar we advanc again
now there came that dusk which often preced the rise of the sun and
through it i could see that the battl wa not yet over sinc gather
in front of us wa still a forc about equal to our own ayesha point
toward it with her wand and we leapt forward to the attack here the
men of rezu stood await us for thei seem to overcom their terror
with the approach of dai
the battl wa fierc a veri strang battl in that dim uncertain
light which scarc show us friend from foe inde i am not sure
that we should have won it sinc ayesha wa no longer visibl to give
our amahagg confid and as the courag of the rezuit increas
so their seem to lessen with the pass of the night
fortun howev just as the issu hung doubt there wa a
shout to our left and look i made out the tall shape of goroko the
witchdoctor with the other zulu follow by hi two hundr and fifti
men and leap on to the flank of the line of rezu
that settl the busi the enemi crumpl up and melt and just
then the first light of dawn appear in the sky i look about me for
ayesha but she had gone where to i knew not though at the moment i
fear that she must have been kill in the mle
then i gave up look and think sinc now or never wa the time
for action signal and shout to those hatchetfac amahagg to
advanc accompani by umslopogaa with goroko who had join us and
han i sprang forward to give them an exampl which to be just to
them thei took
thi is the mound on which redbeard should be cri han as we face
a littl slope
i ran up it and through the gloom which preced the actual dawn saw a
group of men gather round someth as peopl collect about a street
accid
redbeard on the stone thei ar kill him screech han again
it wa so at least sever whiterob priest were bend over a
prostrat figur with knive in their hand while behind stood the huge
fellow whom i took to be rezu stare toward the east as though he
were wait for the rim of the sun to appear befor he gave some order
at that veri moment it did appear just a thin edg of bright light on
the horizon and he turn shout the order
too late for we were on them umslopogaa cut down on of the priest
with hi ax and the men about me dealt with the other while han
with a coupl of sweep of hi long knife sever the cord with which
robertson wa ti
the poor man who in the grow light i could see wa rave mad sprang
up call out someth in scotch about the deil seiz a great
spear which had fallen from the hand of on of the priest he rush
furious at the giant who had given the order and with a yell drove
it at hi heart i saw the spear snap from which i conclud that thi
man whom rightli i took to be rezu wore some kind of armour
next instant the ax he held a great weapon flash aloft and down
went robertson befor it aw stroke stone dead for as we found out
afterward he wa cloven almost in two at the sight of the death of
my poor friend rage took hold of me in my hand wa a doublebarrel
rifl an express load with hollowpoint bullet i cover the
giant and let drive first with on barrel and then with the other and
what is more distinctli i heard both bullet strike upon him
yet he did not fall he rock a littl that is all then turn and
march off toward a hut that whereof han had told me which stood
about fifti yard awai
leav him to me shout umslopogaa steel cut where bullet cannot
pierc and with a bound like to that of a buck the great zulu leapt
awai after him
i think that rezu meant to enter the hut for some purpos of hi own
but umslopogaa wa too hard upon hi track at ani rate he ran past it
and down the other slope of the littl hill on to the plain behind where
the remnant of hi armi were try to reform there in front of them
the giant turn and stood at bai
umslopogaa halt also wait for us to come up sinc cun old
warrior as he wa he fear lest should he begin the fight befor that
happen the hord of them would fall on him thirti second later
we arriv and found him stand still with bent bodi small shield
advanc and the great ax rais as though in the act of strike a
wondrou pictur outlin as it wa against the swiftli risingsun
some ten pace awai stood the giant lean on the ax he bore which
wa not unlik to that with which woodmen fell big tree he wa an evil
man to see and at thi my first full sight of him i liken him in
my mind to goliath whom david overthrew huge he wa and hairi with
deepset pierc ey and a great hook nose hi face seem thin
and ancient also when with a motion of the great head he toss hi
long lock back from about it but hi limb were those of a hercul
and hi movement full of a youth vigour moreov hi aspect as a
whole wa that of a devil rather than of a man inde the sight of it
sicken me
let me shoot him i cri to umslopogaa for i had reload the rifl
as i ran
nai watcherbynight answer the zulu without move hi head
rifl ha had it chanc and fail now let us see what ax can do if
i cannot kill thi man i will be born henc feet first who shall have
made a long journei for noth
then the giant began to talk in a low rumbl voic that reverber
from the slope of the littl hill behind us
who ar you he ask speak in the same tongu that the amahagg
us who dare to come face to face with rezu black hound do you not
know that i cannot be slain who have live a year for everi week of your
life dai and set my foot upon the neck of men by thousand have
you not seen the spear shatter and the iron ball melt upon my breast
like raindrop and would you try to bring me down with that toi you
carri my armi is defeatedi know it but what matter that when i can
get me more becaus the sacrific wa not complet and the white queen
wa not wed therefor my armi wa defeat by the magic of lulala the
white witch who dwell in the tomb but i am not defeat who cannot
be slain until i show my back and then onli by a certain ax which long
ago ha rust into dust
now of thi long speech umslopogaa understood noth so i answer
for him briefli enough but to the point for there flash into my
mind all ayesha tale about an ax
a certain ax i cri ay a certain ax well look at that which
is held by the black on the captain who is name slaughter the
ancient ax whose titl is chieftai becaus if so she will she
take the live of all look at it well rezu giant and wizard and
sai whether it is not that which your forefath lost that which is
destin to bring you to your doom
thu i spoke veri loudli that all might hear slowli also paus
between each word becaus i wish to give time for the light to
strengthen see as i did that the rai of the rise sun struck upon
the face of the giant wherea the ey of umslopogaa were less dazzl
by it
rezu heard and stare at the ax which umslopogaa held aloft caus
it to quiver slightli by an impercept motion of hi arm as he
stare i saw hi hideou face chang and that on it for the first time
gather a look of someth resembl fear also hi follow behind
him who were also studi the ax began to murmur togeth
for here i should sai that as though by common consent the battl had
been stai we no longer attack and the enemi no longer ran thei
or whose who were left of them stood still as though thei felt that the
real and ultim issu of the fight depend upon the forthcom duel
between these two champion though of that issu thei had littl
doubt sinc as i learn afterward thei believ their king to be
invulner
for quit a while rezu went on stare then he said aloud as if he were
think to himself
it is like veri like the horn haft is the same the point goug is
the same the blade shape like the young moon is the same almost could
i think that befor me shook the ancient holi ax nai the god have
taken that back long ago and thi is but a trick of the witch lulala of
the cave
thu he spoke but still for a moment hesit
umslopogaa i said in the deep silenc that follow hear me
i hear you he answer without turn hi head or move hi arm
what counsel watcherbynight
thi slaughter strike not at that man face and breast for there
i think he is protect by witchcraft or by armour get behind him and
strike at hi back do you understand
nai macumazahn i understand not yet i will do your bid becaus
you ar wiser than i and utter no empti word now be still
then umslopogaa threw the ax into the air and caught it as it fell
and as he did so began to chant hi own prais zulu fashion
oho he said i am the child of the lion the blackman lion whose
claw never loosen of their prei i am the wolfk he who hunt
with the wolv upon the witchmountain with my brother bearer of
the club name watcheroftheford i am he who slew him call the
unconqu chief of the peopl of the ax he who bore the ancient ax
befor me i am he who smote the halakazi tribe in their cave and won
me nada the lili to wife i am he who took to the king dingaan a gift
that he love littl and afterward with mopo my fostersir hurl
thi dingaan down to death i am the royal on name bulalio the
slaughter name woodpeck name umhlopekazi the captain befor
whom never yet man ha stood in fair and open fight now thou wizard
rezu now thou giant now thou ghostman come on against me and befor
the sun ha risen by a hand breadth all those who watch shall see
which of us is better at the game of war come on then come on for
i sai that my blood boil over and my feet grow cold come on thou
grin dog thou monster grown fat with eat the flesh of men thou
hookbeak vultur thou old greywhisk wolf
thu he chang in hi fierc boast wai while hi two remain
zulu clap their hand and sentenc by sentenc echo hi word and
goroko the witchdoctor mutter incant behind him
while he sang thu umslopogaa began to stir first onli hi head and
shoulder move gentli swai from side to side like a reed shaken in
the wind or a snake about to strike then slowli he put out first on
foot and next the other and drew them back again as a dancer might do
tempt rezu to attack
but the giant would not hi shield held befor him he stood still and
wait to see what thi black warrior would do
the snake struck umslopogaa dart in and let drive with the long
ax rezu rais hi shield abov hi head and caught the blow from the
clank it made i knew that thi shield which seem to be of hide wa
line with iron rezu smote back but befor the blow could fall the
zulu wa out of hi reach thi taught me how great wa the giant
strength for though the stroke wa heavi like the steelhat ax he
bore still when he saw that it had miss he check the weapon in mid
air which onli a mighti man could have done
umslopogaa saw these thing also and chang hi tactic hi ax wa
six or eight inch longer in the haft than that of rezu and therefor
he could reach where rezu could not for the giant wa shortarm
he twist it round in hi hand so that the moonshap blade wa
uppermost and keep it almost at full length began to peck with the
gougeshap point on the back at the head and arm of rezu that as i
knew wa a favourit trick of hi in fight from which he won hi name
of woodpeck rezu defend hi head with hi shield as best he could
against the sharp point of steel which flash all about him
twice it seem to me that the zulu peck went home upon the giant
breast but if so thei did no harm either rezu thick beard or armour
beneath it stop them from penetr hi bodi still he roar
out as though with pain or furi or both and grow mad charg at
umslopogaa and smote with all hi strength
the zulu caught the blow upon hi shield through which it shore as
though the tough hide were paper stai the stroke it could not yet it
turn it direct so that the fall ax slid past umslopogaass
shoulder do him no hurt next instant befor rezu could strike
again the zulu threw the sever shield into hi face and seiz the
ax with both hand leapt in and struck it wa a mighti blow for i
saw the rhinoceroshorn handl of the famou ax bend like a drawn bow
and it went home with a dull thud full upon rezu breast he shook but
no more evid the razor edg of inkosikaa had fail to pierc
there wa a sound as though a hollow tree had been smitten and some
strand of the long beard shorn off fell to the ground but that wa
all
tagati bewitch cri the watch zulu that stroke should
have cut him in two while i thought to myself that thi man knew how
to make good armour
rezu laugh aloud a bellow kind of laugh while umslopogaa sprang
back astonish
is it thu he cri in zulu well all wizard have some door by
which their spirit enter and depart i must find the door i must find
the door
so he spoke and with spring movement tri to get past rezu first
to the right and then to the left all the while keep out of reach
but rezu ever turn and face him as he did so retreat step by
step down the slope of the littl hill and strike whenev he found a
chanc but without avail for alwai umslopogaa wa beyond hi reach
also the sunlight which now grew strong dazzl him or so i thought
moreov he seem to tire somewh so i thought also
at ani rate he determin to make an end of the plai for with a swift
motion as umslopogaa had done he threw awai hi shield and grasp
the iron handl of hi ax with both hand charg the zulu like a
bull umslopogaa leapt back out of reach then suddenli he turn and
ran up the rise ye bulalio the slaughter ran
a roar of mockeri went up from the sunworshipp behind while our
amahagg laugh and goroko and the two zulu stare astonish and
asham onli i read hi mind aright and wonder what guil he had
conceiv
he ran and rezu ran after him but never could he catch the
swiftestfoot man in zululand to and fro he follow him for
umslopogaa wa take a zigzag path toward the crest of the slope
till at length rezu stop breathless but umslopogaa still ran
anoth twenti yard or so until he reach the top of the slope and
there halt and wheel round
for ten second or more he stood draw hi breath in great gasp and
look at hi face i saw that it had becom as the face of a wolf
hi lip were drawn up into a terribl grin show the white teeth
between hi cheek seem to have fallen in and hi ey glare while
the skin over the hole in hi forehead beat up and down
there he stood gather himself togeth for some mighti effort
run on shout the spectat run back to kr black dog
umslopogaa knew that thei were mock him but he took no heed onli
bent down and rub hi sweat hand in the grit of the dry earth
then he straighten himself and charg down on rezu
i allan quatermain have seen mani thing in battl but never befor
or sinc did i see aught like to thi charg it wa swift as that of
a lioness so swift that the zulu feet scarc seem to touch the
ground on he sped like a thrown spear till when within about a dozen
feet of rezu who stood stare at him he bent hi frame almost doubl
and leapt into the air
oh what a leap wa that sure he must have learnt it from the lion
or the springbuck high he rose and now i saw hi purpos it wa to
clear the tall shape of rezu ay and he clear him with half a foot
to spare and as he pass abov smote downward with the ax so that
the blow fell upon the back of rezu head moreov it went home thi
time for i saw the red blood stream and rezu fell forward on hi face
umslopogaa land far beyond him ran a littl wai becaus he must
then wheel round and charg again
rezu wa rise but befor he gain hi feet the ax inkosikaa
thunder down where the neck join the shoulder and sank in still so
great wa hi strength that rezu found hi feet and smote out wildli
but now hi movement were slow and again umslopogaa got behind him
smite at hi back onc twice thrice he smote and at the third
blow it seem as though the massiv spine were sever for hi weapon
fell from rezu hand and slowli he sank down to the ground and lai
there a huddl heap
believ that all wa over i ran to where he lai with umslopogaa
stand over him as it seem to me utterli exhaust for he
support himself by the ax and totter upon hi feet but rezu wa
not yet dead he open hi cavern ey and glare at the zulu with a
look of hellish hate
thou hast not conquer me black on he gasp it is thine ax
which gave thee victori the ancient holi ax that onc wa mine until
the woman stole it ye that and the craft of the witch of the cave
who told thee to smite where the spirit of life which i fear to enter
wholli had not kiss my flesh and there onli left me mortal wolf of
a black man mai we meet elsewher and fight thi frai again ah would
that i could get these hand about thy throat and take thee with me down
into the dark but lulala win if onli for a while sinc her fate
i think shall be wors than mine ah i see the magic beauti that she
boast turn to shame
here of a sudden life left him and throw hi great arm wide a last
breath pass bubbl from hi lip
as i stoop to examin the man huge and hairi carcas that to me
look onli half human with a thunder of feet our amahagg rush down
upon us and thrust me asid fell upon the bodi of their ancient foe
like hound upon a helpless fox and with hand and spear and knive
liter tore and hack it limb from limb till no semblanc of
human remain
it wa imposs to stop them inde i wa too outworn with labour
and emot to make ani such attempt thi i regret the more sinc
i lost the opportun of make an examin of the bodi of thi
trolllik man and of ascertain what kind of armour it wa he wore
beneath that great beard of hi which wa strong enough to stop my
bullet and even the razor edg of the ax inkosikaa driven with all
the might of the arm of the zulu bulalio for when i look again
at the sicken sight the giant wa but scatter fragment and the
armour whatev it might have been wa gone rent to littl piec and
carri off doubtless by the amahagg perhap to be divid between
them to serv as charm
so of rezu i know onli that he wa the hugest most terriblelook
man i have ever seen on too who carri hi vast strength veri late
in life sinc from the aspect of hi counten i imagin that he must
have been nigh upon seventi year of ag though hi suppos unnatur
antiqu of cours wa noth but a fabl put about by the nativ for
their own purpos
present umslopogaa seem to recov from the kind of faint into
which he had fallen and open hi ey look about him the first
person thei fell on wa old billali who stood stroke hi white beard
and contempl the scene with an air which wa at onc philosoph
and satisfi thi seem to anger umslopogaa for he cri
i think it wa you ancient bag of word and sweeper of path for the
feet of the great who made a mock of me but now when you thought
that i fled befor the horn of yonder maneat bull and he nod
toward the fragment of what onc had been rezu find now hi ax
and though i am weak and weari i will wash awai the insult with your
blood
what doe thi gloriou black hero sai watcherbynight ask
billali in hi most courteou tone
i told him word by word whereon billali lift hi hand in horror
turn and fled nor did i see him again until we arriv at kr
at the sight of the fall of their giant chief rezu whom thei believ
to be invulner hi follow who were watch the frai set up
a great wail a most mourn and uncanni nois to hear then as i
think did the host of the philistin when david brought down goliath
by hi admir shot with a stone thei set out for their home
wherev these mai have been at an absolut record pace and in the
completest disarrai
our amahagg follow them for a while but soon were left stand
still so thei content themselv with kill ani wound thei could
find and return i did not accompani them inde the battl be
won metaphor i wash my hand of them and in my thought
consign them to a certain local as a peopl of whom it might
well be said that manner thei had none and their custom were simpli
beastli also although fierc and cruel these nightbat were not
good fight men and in short never did i wish to have to do with such
anoth compani
moreov a veri differ matter press the object of thi busi
so far as i wa concern had been to rescu poor inez sinc had
it not been for her sake never would i have consent to lead those
amahagg against their fellow blackguard the rezuit
but where wa inez if han had understood the medicineman aright
she wa or had been in the hut where it wa my earnest hope that she
still remain sinc otherwis the hunt must be continu thi at
ani rate wa easi to discov call han who wa amus himself
by take long shot at the fly enemi so that thei might not forget
him as he said and the zulu i walk up the slope to the hut or
rather booth of bough for it wa quit twenti feet long by twelv or
fifteen broad
at it eastern end wa a doorwai or open close with a heavi curtain
here i paus full of tremor and listen for to tell the truth i
dread to draw that curtain fear what i might see within gather
up my courag at length i tore it asid and a revolv in my hand
look in at first after the strong light without for the sun wa now
well up i could see noth sinc those green bough and palm leav
were veri close woven as my ey grew accustom to the gloom
howev i perceiv a glitter object seat on a kind of throne
at the end of the booth while in a doubl row in front knelt six
whiterob women who seem to wear chain about their neck and
carri larg knive slung round their middl on the floor between
these women and the throne lai a dead man a priest of some sort as
i gather from hi garb who still held a huge spear in hi hand so
silent were the figur on the throne and those that knelt befor it
that at first i thought that all of them must be dead
ladi sadey whisper han and her bridewomen doubtless that
old predik came to kill her when he saw that the battl wa lost but
the bridewomen kill him with their knive
here i mai state that han supposit prove to be quit correct
which show how quick and deduct wa hi mind the figur on the
throne wa inez the priest in hi disappoint rage had come to kill
her and the bridewomen had kill him with their knive befor he
could do so
i bade the zulu tear down the curtain and pull awai some of the end
bough so as to let in more light then we advanc up the place
hold our pistol and spear in readi the kneel women turn
their head to look at us and i saw that thei were all young and
handsom in their fashion although fiercefac also i saw their hand
go to the knive thei wore i call to them to let these be and come
out and that if thei did so thei had noth to fear but if thei
understood thei did not heed my word
on the contrari while han and i cover them with our pistol fear
lest thei should stab the person on the throne whom we took to be inez
at some word from on of them thei bow simultan toward her
then at anoth word suddenli thei drew the knive and plung them to
their own heart
it wa a dread sight and on of which i never saw the like nor to
thi dai do i know why the deed wa done unless perhap the women were
sworn to the servic of the new queen and fear that if thei fail to
protect her thei would be doom to some aw end at ani rate we got
them out dead or dy for their blow had been strong and true and
not on of them live for more than a few minut
then i advanc to the figur on the throne or rather footstool
chair of black wood inlaid with ivori which sat so silent and
motionless that i wa certain it wa that of a dead woman especi
when i perceiv that she wa fasten to the chair with leather strap
which were sewn over with gold wire also she wa veil and with on
except made up if i mai us the term exactli to resembl the ladi
ayesha even down to the two long plait of black hair each finish
with some kind of pearl and to the sandal feet
the except wa that about her hung a great necklac of gold ornament
from which were suspend pendant also of gold repres the rai
disc of the sun in rude but bold and strike workmanship
i went to her and have cut the strap sinc i could not stop to unti
their knot lift the veil
beneath it wa inez sure enough and inez live for her breast rose
and fell as she breath but inez senseless her ey were wide open
yet she wa quit senseless probabl she had been drug or perhap
some of the sight of horror which she saw had taken awai her mind i
confess that i wa glad that thi wa so who otherwis must have told
her the dread stori of her father end
we bore her out and awai from that horribl place appar quit
unhurt and laid her under the shadow of a tree till a litter could be
procur i could do no more who knew not how to treat her state and
had no spirit with me to pour down her throat
thi wa the end of our long pursuit and thu we rescu inez whom the
zulu call the ladi sadey
chapter xix
the spell
of our return to kr i need sai noth except that in due cours we
reach that interest ruin the journei wa chiefli remark for
on thing that on thi occas i imagin for the first and last time
in hi life umslopogaa consent to be carri in a litter at least
for part of the wai he wa as i have said unwound for the ax
of hi mighti foe had never onc so much as touch hi skin what he
suffer from wa shock a kind of collaps sinc although few would
have thought it thi great and utterli fearless warrior wa at bottom a
nervou highlystrung man
it is onli the nervou that climb the highest point of anyth and
thi is true of fight as of all other that fear frai with rezu had
been a great strain on the zulu as he put it himself the wizard had
suck the strength out of him especi when he found that ow
to hi armour he could not harm him in front and ow to hi cun
could not get at him behind then it wa that he conceiv the desper
expedi of leap over hi head and smite backward as he leapt
a trick he told me that he had onc plai year befor when he wa
young in order to break a shield ring and reach on who stood in it
centr
in thi great leap over rezu head umslopogaa knew that he must
succe or be slain which in turn would mean my death and that of the
other for thi reason he face the shame of seem to fly in order to
gain the higher ground whenc alon he could gather the speed necessari
to such a terrif spring
well he made it and therebi conquer and thi wa the end but as he
said it had left him weak as a snake when it crawl out of it hole
into the sun after the long winter sleep
of on thing umslopogaa ad he wa thank name that rezu
had never succeed in get hi arm round him sinc he wa quit
certain that if he had he would have broken him as a baboon break a
mealiestalk no strength not even hi could have resist the iron
might of that huge gorillalik man
i agre with him who had note rezu vast chest and swell muscl
also the weight of the blow that he struck with the steelhaft
ax which by the wai when i sought for it wa miss stolen i
suppos by on of the amahagg
whenc did that strength come i wonder in on who from hi face
appear to be old wa there perchanc after all some truth in the
legend of samson and did it dwell in that gigant beard and those long
lock of hi it wa imposs to sai and probabl the man wa but a
herculean freak for that he wa as strong as hercul all the stori
that i heard afterward of hi feat left littl room for doubt
about on thing onli wa i certain in connect with him name that
the tale of hi supernatur abil were the merest humbug he wa
simpli on of the repres of the famili of strong men of whom
exampl ar still to be seen do marvel feat all over the earth
for the rest he wa dead and broken up by those amahagg bloodhound
befor i could examin him or hi bodyarmour either and there wa
an end of him and hi stori but when i look at the corps of poor
robertson which i did as we buri it where he fell and saw that
though so larg and thickset it wa cleft almost in two by a singl
blow of rezu ax i came to understand what the might of thi savag
must have been
i sai savag but i am not sure that thi is a right descript of
rezu evid he had a religion of a sort also imagin as wa
shown by the theft of the white woman to be hi queen by hi veil
of her to resembl ayesha whom he dread by the intend propitiatori
sacrific by the guard of women sworn to her servic who slew the
priest that tri to kill her and afterward commit suicid when
thei had fail in their offic and by other thing all thi indic
someth more than savageri perhap surviv from a forgotten
civilis or perhap nativ abil on the part of an individu
ruler i do not know and it matter noth
rezu is dead and the world is well rid of him and those who want to
learn more of hi peopl can go to studi such as remain of them in their
own habitat which for my part i never wish to visit ani more
dure our journei to kr poor inez never stir whenev i went to
look at her in the litter i found her ly there with her ey open
and a fix stare upon her face which frighten me veri much sinc i
began to fear lest she should die howev i could do noth to help
her except urg the bearer to top speed so swiftli did we travel down
the hill and across the plain that we reach kr just as the sun wa
set as we cross the moat i perceiv old billali come to meet
us thi he did with mani bow keep an anxiou ey upon the litter
which he had learn contain umslopogaa inde hi attitud and that
of the amahagg toward the two of us and even han thenceforward
becam almost abject sinc after our victori over rezu and hi death
beneath the ax thei look upon us as half divin and treat us
accordingli
o mighti gener he said shewhocommand bid me conduct the ladi
who is sick to the place that ha been made readi for her which is near
your own so that you mai watch over her if you will
i wonder how ayesha knew that inez wa sick but be too tire
to ask question mere bade him lead on thi he did take us to
anoth ruin hous next to our own quarter which had been swept
clean and furnish after a fashion and moreov cleverli roof in
with mat so that it wa realli quit comfort here we found two
middleag women of a veri superior type who billali inform me
were by trade nurs of the sick have seen her laid upon her bed i
commit inez to their charg sinc the case wa not on that i dare
to try to doctor myself not know what drug of the few i possess
should be administ to her moreov billali comfort me with the
inform that soon shewhocommand would visit her and make her
well again as she could do
i answer that i hope so and went to our quarter where i found an
excel meal readi cook and with it a stone flagon of the content
of which billali said we were all three to drink by the command of
ayesha who declar that it would take awai our weari
i tri the stuff which wa pale yellow in colour like sherri and for
aught i knew might be poison to find it most comfort though it
did not seem to be veri strong to the tast certainli too it effect
were wonder sinc present all my great weari fell from me
like a discard cloak and i found myself with a splendid appetit and
feel better and stronger than i had done for year in short that
drink wa a cocktail of the best on of which i onli wish i possess
the recip though ayesha told me afterward that it wa distil from
quit harmless herb and not in ani sens a spirit
have discov thi i gave some of it to han also to umslopogaa
who wa with the wound zulu who we found were progress well
toward complet recoveri and lastli to goroko who also wa worn
out on all of these the effect of that magic brew prove most
satisfactori
then have wash i at a splendid dinner though in thi respect
han who wa seat on the ground nearbi far outpass my finest
effort
baa he said thing have gone veri well with us when thei might
have gone veri ill the baa redbeard is dead which is a good thing
sinc a madman would have been difficult to look after and a brain full
of moonshin is a bad companion for ani on oh without doubt he is
better dead though your reverend father the predik will have a hard
job look after him there in the place of fire
perhap i said with a sigh sinc it is better to be dead than
to live a lunat but what i fear is that the ladi hi daughter will
follow him
oh no baa repli han cheerfulli though i daresai that she
will alwai be a littl mad also becaus you see it is in her blood and
doubtless she ha look on dread thing but the great medicin will
see to it that she doe not die after we have taken so much troubl
and gone into such big danger to save her that great medicin is veri
wonder baa first of all it make you gener over those amahagg
who without you would never have fought as the witch who ti up her
head in a cloth knew well enough then it bring us safe through the
battl and give strength to umslopogaa to kill the old maneat
giant
why did it not give me strength to kill him han i let him have two
express bullet on hi chest which hurt him no more than a tap upon the
horn with a danc stick would hurt a bullbuffalo
oh baa perhap you miss him who becaus you hit thing sometim
think that you do so alwai
have wait to see if i would rise to thi piec of insol which
of cours i did not he went on by wai of let me down easili or
perhap he wore veri good armour under hi beard for i saw some of
those amahagg who pull hi hair off and cut him to piec go awai
with what look like littl bit of brass also the great medicin
meant that he should be kill by umslopogaa and not by you sinc
otherwis umslopogaa would have been sad for the rest of hi life
wherea now he will walk about the world as proud as a cock with two
tail and crow all night as well as all dai then baa when rezu broke
the squar and the amahagg began to run without doubt it wa the
great medicin which chang their heart and made them brave again so
that thei charg at the right moment when thei saw it go forward on
your breast and instead of be eaten up at up the cannib
inde i thought that the ladi who dwell yonder had someth to do
with that busi did you see her han
oh ye i saw her baa and i think that without doubt she lift the
cloth from over her head and when the peopl of rezu saw how ugli wa
the face beneath it did frighten them a littl but doubtless the great
medicin put that thought into her also for baa what could a silli
woman do in such a case did you ever know of a woman who wa of ani us
in a battl or for anyth els except to nurs babi and thi on
doe not even do that no doubt becaus be so hideou under that
sheet no man can be found to marri her
now i look up by chanc and in the light of the lamp saw ayesha
stand in the room which she had enter through the open doorwai
within six feet of han back inde
be sure baa he went on that thi bundl of rag is noth but a
common old cheat who frighten peopl by pretend to be a spook as
if she dare to sai that it wa she who made those stink amahagg
charg and not the great medicin of the openerofroad i would tell
her to her face
now i wa too paralys to speak and while i wa reflect that it wa
fortun ayesha did not understand dutch she move a littl so that
on of the lamp behind her caus her shadow to fall on to the back
of the squat han and over it on to the floor beyond he saw it and
stare at the distort shape of the hood head then slowli screw
hi neck round and look upward behind him
for a moment he went on stare as though he were frozen then utter
a wild yell he scrambl to hi feet bolt out of the hous and
vanish into the night
it seem allan said ayesha slowli that yonder yellow ap of your
is veri bold at throw stick when the leopardess is not beneath the
tree but when she come it is otherwis with him oh make no excus
for i know well that he wa speak ill thing of me becaus be
curiou as ap ar he burn to learn what is behind my veil and
be simpl believ that no woman would hide her face unless it
fashion were not pleas to the nice tast of men
then to my relief she laugh a littl softli which show me that
she had a sens of humour and went on well let him be for he is a
good ap and courag in hi fashion as he show when he went out to
spy upon the host of rezu and stab the murdererpriest by the stone
of sacrific
how can you know the word of han ayesha i ask see that he
spoke in a tongu which you have never learn
perchanc i read face allan
or back i suggest rememb that hi wa turn to her
or back or voic or heart it matter littl which sinc read i
do but have done with such childish talk and lead me to thi maiden who
ha been snatch from the claw of rezu and a fate that is wors than
death do you understand allan that er the demon rezu took her to
wife the plan wa to sacrific her own father to her and then eat him
as the woman with her wa eaten and befor her ey now the father is
dead which is well as i think the littl yellow man said to younai
start not i read it from hi back hajbsinc had he live whose
brain wa rot he would have rave till hi death dai better
therefor that he should die like a man fight against a foe
unconquer by all save on but she still live
ay but mindless ayesha
which in great troubl such as she ha pass is a bless state o
allan bethink you have there not been dai ay and month in your
own life when you would have rejoic to sleep in mindless and
should we not perchanc be happier all of us if like the beast we
could not rememb foreknow and understand oh men talk of heaven but
believ me the real heaven is on of dreamless sleep sinc life
and wake howev high their scale and on whatev star mean
struggl which be so oft mistaken must breed sorrowor remors
that spoil all come now
so i preced her to the next ruin hous where we found inez ly on
the bed still cloth in her barbar trap although the veil had
been drawn off her face there she lai wideei and still while the
women watch her ayesha look at her a while then said to me
so thei trick her out to be ayesha mock and imag and in time
accept by those barbarian as my veri self and even set the seal
of royalti on her and she point to the gold disc stamp with the
like of the sun well she is a fair maiden white and gentli bred
the first such that i have seen for mani an ag nor did she wish thi
trickeri moreov she ha taken no hurt her soul ha sunk deep into a
sea of horror and that is all whenc doubtless it can be drawn again
yet i think it best that for a while she should rememb naught lest
her brain break as did her father and therefor no net of mine shall
drag her back to memori let that return gentli in futur dai and then
of it not too much for so shall all thi terror becom to her a void in
which sad shape move like shadow and as shadow ar soon forgot
and gone no more to be held than dream by the awaken sens stand
asid allan and you women leav us for a while
i obei and the women bow and went then ayesha drew up her veil
and knelt down by the bed of inez but in such a fashion that i could
not see her face although i admit that i tri to do so i could see
howev that she set her lip against those of inez and as i gather
by her motion seem to breath into her lip also she lift her
hand and place on of them upon the heart of inez for a minut or
more swai the other from side to side abov her ey paus at time
to touch her upon the forehead with her fingertip
present inez stir and sat up whereon ayesha took a vessel of milk
which stood upon the floor and held it to her lip inez drank to the
last drop then sank on to the bed again for a while longer ayesha
continu the motion of her hand then let fall her veil and rose
look i have laid a spell upon her she said beckon to me to draw
near
i did so and perceiv that now the ey of inez were shut and that she
seem to be plung in a deep and natur sleep
so she will remain for thi night and that dai which follow said
ayesha and when she wake it will be i think to believ herself onc
more a happi child not until she see her home again will she find
her womanhood and then all thi stori will be forgotten by her of
her father you must tell her that he di when you went out to hunt the
riverbeast togeth and if she seek for certain other that thei
have gone awai but i think that she will ask littl more when she
learn that he is dead sinc i have laid that command upon her soul
hypnot suggest thought i to myself and i onli hope to heaven
that it will work
ayesha seem to guess what wa pass through my mind for she nod
and said
have no fear allan for i am what the black axebear and the littl
yellow man call a witch which mean as you who ar instruct know
on who ha knowledg of medicin and other thing and who hold a kei
to some of the mysteri that lie hid in natur
for instanc i suggest of how to transport yourself into a battl
at the right moment and out of it againalso at the right moment
ye allan sinc watch from afar i saw that those amahagg cur
were about to flee and that i wa need there to hearten them and to
put fear into the armi of rezu so i came
but how did you come ayesha
she laugh as she answer
perhap i did not come at all perhap you onli thought i came sinc i
seem to be there the rest matter noth
as i still look unconvinc she went on
oh foolish man seek not to learn of that which is too high for you
yet listen you in your ignor suppos that the soul dwell within
the bodi do you not
i answer that i had alwai been under thi impress
yet allan it is otherwis for the bodi dwell within the soul
like the pearl in an oyster i suggest
ay in a sens sinc the pearl which to you is beauti is to the
oyster a sick and a poison and so is the bodi to the soul whose
templ it troubl and defil yet round it is the white and holi soul
that ever seek to bring the vile bodi to it own puriti and colour yet
ofttim fail learn allan that flesh and spirit ar the deadliest
foe join togeth by a high decre that thei mai forget their hate
and perfect each other or fail be separ to all etern the
spirit go to it own place and the flesh to it corrupt
a strang theori i said
ay allan and on which is so new to you that never will you
understand it yet it is true and i set it out for thi reason the soul
of man be at liberti and not coop within hi narrow breast is in
touch with that soul of the univers which men know as god whom thei
call by mani name therefor it ha all knowledg and perhap all
power and at time the bodi within it if it be a wise bodi can draw
from thi well of knowledg and abound power so at least can i and
now you will understand why i am so good a doctoress and how i came to
appear in the battl as you said at the right time and to leav it
when my work wa done
oh ye i answer i quit understand i thank you much for put
it so plainli
she laugh a littl appreci my jest look at the sleep inez
and said
the fair bodi of thi ladi dwell in a larg soul i think though on
of a somewhat sombr hue for soul have their colour allan and stain
that which is within them she will never be a happi woman
the black peopl name her sadey i said
is it so well i name her sadheart though for such often there is
joi at last meanwhil she will forget ye she will forget the worst
and how narrow wa the edg between her and the arm of rezu
just the width of the blade of the ax inkosikaa i answer
but tell me ayesha why could not that ax cut and why did my bullet
flatten or turn asid when these smote the breast of rezu
becaus hi frontarmour wa good allan i suppos she repli
indiffer and on hi back he wore none
then why did you fill my ear with such a differ tale about that
horribl giant have drunk of a cup of life and all the rest i ask
with irrit
i have forgotten allan perhap becaus the curiou such as you ar
like to hear tale even stranger than their own which in the dai to be
mai becom their own therefor you will be wise to believ onli what i
do and of what i tell you noth
i dont i exclaim exasper
she laugh again and repli
what need to sai to me that which i know alreadi yet perhap in the
futur it mai be differ sinc often by the alchemi of the mind the
fabl of our youth ar chang into the fact of our ag and we come
to believ in anyth as your littl yellow man believ in some
savag name zikali and those amahagg believ in the talisman round
your neck and i who am the maddest of you all believ in love and
wisdom and the black warrior umslopogaa believ in the virtu of
that great ax of hi rather than in those of hi own courag and of
the strength that wield it fool everi on of us though perchanc
i am the greatest fool among them now take me to the warrior
umslopogaa whom i would thank as i thank you allan and the littl
yellow man although he jeer at me with hi sharp tongu not know
that if i were anger with a breath i could caus him to ceas to be
then why did you not choos rezu to ceas to be and hi armi also
ayesha
it seem that i have done these thing through the ax of umslopogaa
and by the help of your generalship allan why then wast my own
strength when your lai to my hand
becaus you had no power over rezu ayesha or so you told me
have i not said that my word ar snowflak meant to melt and leav
no trace hide my thought as thi veil hide my beauti yet as the
beauti is beneath the veil perchanc there is truth beneath the word
though not that truth you think so you ar well answer and for the
rest i wonder whether rezu thought i had no power over him when yonder
on the mountain spur he saw me float down upon hi compani like a
spirit of the night well perchanc some dai i shall learn thi and
mani other thing
i made no answer sinc what wa the us of argu with a woman who
told me frankli that all she said wa fals so although i long to
ask her why these amahagg had such rever for the talisman that
han call the great medicin sinc now i guess that her first
explan concern it were quit untru i held my tongu
yet as we went out of the hous by some coincid she allud to thi
veri matter
i wish to tell you allan she said why it wa those amahagg would
not accept you as a gener till their ey had seen that which you wear
upon your breast their tale of a legend of thi veri thing seem that
of savag or of their cun priest not to be believ by a wise man
such as you ar like some other that you have heard in kr yet it ha
in it a grain of truth for as it chanc a littl while ago about a
hundr year ago i think the old wizard whose pictur is cut upon
the wood came to visit her who held my place befor me as ruler of thi
tribesh wa veri like me and as i believ my mother allanbecaus
of her reput for wisdom
at that time i have heard there wa a question of war between the
worshipp of lulala and the grandfath of rezu but thi zikali told
the peopl of lulala that thei must not fight the peopl of rezu until
in a dai to come a white man should visit kr and bring with him a piec
of wood on which wa cut the imag of a dwarf like to that of zikali
himself then and not befor thei must fight and conquer the peopl of
rezu now thi stori came down among them and you who mai have thought
the first tale magic will understand it in it simplic is it not
so you wise allan
oh ye i answer except that i do not see how zikali can have
come here a hundr year ago sinc men do not live as long although
he pretend to have done so
no allan nor do i but perhap it wa hi father or hi grandfath
who came sinc be observ you will have note that if the parent
is misform so often ar the descend also that the pretenc of
wizardri at time come down with the blood
again i made no answer for i saw that ayesha wa fool me and befor
she could exhaust that amus we reach the place where umslopogaa
and hi men were gather round a camp fire he sat silent but goroko
with much anim wa tell the stori of the fight in picturesqu
and colour languag or that part of it which he had seen for the
benefit of the two wound men who took no share in it and who ly on
their blanket with head thrust forward were listen with eager
to the entranc tale suddenli thei caught sight of ayesha and those
of the parti who could stand sprang to their feet while on and all
thei gave her the royal salut of bayt
she wait till the sound had di awai then she said
i come to thank you and your men o wielder of the ax who have shown
yourself veri great in battl and to sai to you that my spirit tell
me that everi on of you ye even those who ar still sick will come
safe to your own land again and live out your year with honour
again thei salut at thi pleas intellig when i had translat
it to them for of cours thei knew no arab then she went on
i am told umslopogaa son of the lion as a certain king wa name in
your land that the fight you made against rezu wa a veri great fight
and that such a leap as your abov hi head when you smote him with the
ax on the hinder part where he wore no armour and brought him to hi
death ha not been seen befor nor will be again
i render the word and umslopogaa prefer truth to modesti
repli emphat that thi wa the case
becaus of that fight and that leap ayesha went on as for other
deed that you have done and will do my spirit tell me that your name
will live in stori for mani gener yet of what us is fame to the
dead therefor i make you an offer bide here with me and you shall
rule these amahagg and with them the remnant of the peopl of rezu
your cattl shall be countless and your wive the fairest in the land
and your children mani for i will lift a certain curs from off you
so that no more shall you be childless do you accept o holder of the
ax
when he understood umslopogaa after ponder a moment ask if i
meant to stai in thi land and marri the white chieftai who spoke
such wise word and could appear and disappear in the battl at her
will and like a mountaintop hid her head in a cloud which wa hi wai
of allud to her veil
i answer at onc and with decis that i intend to do noth of
the sort and immedi regret my word sinc although i spoke
in zulu i suppos she read their mean from my face at ani rate she
understood the drift of them
tell him allan she said with a kind of ici polit that you
will not stop here and marri me becaus if ever i chose a husband he
would not be a littl man at the door of whose heart so mani women
hand have knockedy even those that ar blackand not i think in
vain on moreov who hold himself so clever that he believ he
ha noth left to learn and in everi flower of truth that is shown to
him howev fair smell onli poison and beneath nurtur it see
onli the gross root of falsehood plant in corrupt tell him these
thing allan if it pleas you
it doe not pleas me i answer in a rage at her insult
nor is it need allan sinc if i caught the mean of that
barbar tongu you us aright you have told him alreadi well let
the jest pass o man who least of all thing desir to be ayesha
husband and whom ayesha least of all thing desir as her spous and
ask the axebear noth sinc i perceiv that without you he will
not stai at kr nor inde is it fate that he should do so for now
my spirit tell me what it hid from me when i spoke a moment gone that
thi warrior shall die in a great fight far awai and that between then
and now much sorrow wait him who save that of on know not how to win
the love of women let him sai moreov what reward he desir sinc if
i can give it to him it shall be hi
again i translat umslopogaa receiv her propheci in stoical
silenc and as i thought with indiffer and onli said in repli
the glori that i have won is my reward and the onli boon i seek at thi
queen hand is that if she can she should give me sight of a woman for
whom my heart is hungri and with it knowledg that thi woman live in
that land whither i travel like all men
when she heard these word ayesha said
true i had forgotten your heart also is hungri i think allan for
the vision of sundri face that you see no more well i will do my
best but sinc onli faith fulfil itself how can i who must strive to
pierc the gate of dark for on so unbeliev know that thei will
open at my word come to me both of you at the sunset tomorrow
then as though to chang the subject she talk to me for a long while
about kr of which she told me a most interest histori true or
fals that i omit here
at length as though suddenli she had grown tire wave her hand to
show that the convers wa end ayesha went to the wound men and
touch them each in turn
now thei will recov swiftli she said and leav the place wa
gone into the dark
chapter xx
the gate of death
befor turn in i examin these wound men for myself the truth is
that i wa anxiou to learn their exact condit in order that i might
make an estim as to when it would be possibl for us to leav thi
vallei or crater bottom of kr of which i wa heartili tire who could
desir to stai in a place where he had not onli been involv in a deal
of hard doubt and veri danger fight from which all person
interest wa absent but where also he wa mesh in a perfect spider
web of bewilder and expos to continu insult into the bargain
for that is what it came to thi ayesha took everi opportun to jeer
at and affront me and why just becaus i had conceiv doubt which
somehow she discov of the amaz tale with which it had amus
her to stuff me as a farmer wife doe a turkei poult with meal
pellet how could she expect me a man after all of some experi
to believ such li which not half an hour befor in the coolest
possibl fashion she had herself admit to be li and noth els
told for the mere pleasur of romanc
the immort rezu for instanc who had drunk of the cup of life or
some such rubbish now turn out to be noth but a brawni savag
descend from gener of chief also call rezu moreov the
immemori ayesha who also had drunk of cup of life and accord
to her first stori had live in thi place for thousand of year had
come here with a mother who fill the same mystic rle befor her for
the benefit of an extrem gloomi and disagre tribe of semit
savag yet she wa cross with me becaus i had not swallow her crude
and indigest mixtur of fabl and philosophi without a moment
question
at least i suppos that thi wa the reason though anoth possibl
explan did come into my mind i had refus to be duli overcom
by her charm not becaus i wa unimpress for who could be have
look upon that blind beauti even for a moment but rather becaus
after sundri experi i had at last attain to some power of
judgment and learn what it is best to leav alon perhap thi had
annoi her especi as no white man seem to have come her wai for
a long while and the fabul kallikr had not put in hi promis
appear
also it wa unfortun that in on wai or anotherhow did she do it i
wonderedsh had interpret umslopogaa question to me about marri
her and my compromis repli not that for on moment as i saw veri
clearli did she wish to marri me but that fact intuit suggest to
my mind did not the least prevent her from be angri becaus i share
her view upon thi import subject
oh the whole thing wa a bore and the sooner i saw the last of that
veil ladi and the interest but wearisom ruin in which she
dwelt the better i should be pleas although appar i must trek
homeward with a poor young woman who wa out of her mind leav
the bone of her unfortun father behind me i admit to myself
howev that there were consol in the fact that provid
had thu decre for robertson sinc he gave up drink had not been a
cheer companion and two mad peopl would realli have been more than
i could manag
to return for these reason i examin the two wound zulu with
consider anxieti onli to discov anoth instanc of the chicaneri
which it amus thi ayesha to plai off upon me for what did i find
that thei were practic well their hurt which had never been
seriou had heal wonderfulli in that pure air as those of savag
have a wai of do and thei told me themselv that thei felt quit
strong again yet with coloss impud ayesha had manag to suggest
to my mind that she wa go to work some remark cure upon them
who were alreadi cure
well it wa of a piec with the rest of her conduct and there wa
noth to do except go to bed which i did with much gratitud that
my rest place that night wa not of anoth sort the last thing i
rememb wa wonder how on earth ayesha appear and disappear
in the cours of that battl a problem as to which i could find no
solut though as in the case of the other i wa sure that on
would occur to me in cours of time
i slept like a top so soundli inde that i think there wa some kind
of soporif in the pickmeup which look like sherri especi as
the other who had drunk of it also pass an excel night
about ten oclock on the follow morn i awok feel particularli
well and quit as though i had been enjoi a week at the seasid
instead of my recent adventur which includ an abomin battl and
some agonis moment dure which i thought that my number wa up upon
the board of destini
i spent the most of that dai loung about eat talk over the
detail of the battl with umslopogaa and the zulu and smoke more
than usual i forgot to sai that these amahagg grew some capit
tobacco of which i had obtain a suppli although like most african
thei onli us it in the shape of snuff the truth wa that after all
my marvel and acut anxieti also mental and physic exert
i felt like the housemaid who caus to be cut upon her tombston that
she had gone to a better land where her ambit wa to do noth for
ever and ever i just want to be complet idl and vacuousmind
for at least a month but as i knew that all i could expect in that
line wa a singl bank holidai like a citi clerk on the spree of it i
determin to make the most
the result wa that befor the even i felt veri bore inde i had
gone to look at inez who wa still fast asleep as ayesha said would be
the case but whose featur seem to have plump up consider the
reason of thi i gather from her amahagg nurs wa that at
certain interv she had awaken suffici to swallow consider
quantiti of milk or rather cream which i hope would not make her
ill i had chat with the wound zulu who were now walk about
more bore even than i wa myself and heap maledict on their
ancestr spirit becaus thei had not been well enough to take part in
the battl against rezu
i even took a littl stroll to look for han who had vanish in hi
mysteri fashion but the afternoon wa so hot and oppress with
come thunder that soon i came back again and fell into a varieti of
reflect that i need not detail
while i wa thu engag and medit not without uneasi upon
the ordeal that lai befor me after sunset for i felt sure that it
would be an ordeal han appear and said that the amahagg impi
or armi wa gather on that spot where i had been elect to the proud
posit of their gener he ad that he believedhow he got thi
inform i do not knowthat the white ladi wa go to hold a
review of them and give them the reward that thei had earn in the
battl
hear thi umslopogaa and the other zulu said that thei would like
to see thi review if i would accompani them although i did not want to
go nor inde desir ever to look at anoth amahagg i consent to
save the troubl of argument on condit that we should do so from a
distanc
so includ the wound men we stroll off and present came to the
crumbl wall of the old citi beyond which lai the great moat now dry
that onc had encircl it with water
here on the top of thi wall we sat down where we could see without
be seen and observ the amahagg compani consider reduc
dure the battl be marshal by their captain beneath us and
about a coupl of hundr yard awai also we observ sever group
of men under guard these we took to be prison captur in the fight
with rezu who as han remark with a smack of hi lip were probabl
await sacrific
i said i hope not and yawn for realli the afternoon wa intens
hot and the weather most peculiar the sun had vanish behind cloud
and vapour fill the still air so dens that at time it grew almost
dark also when these clear for brief interv the landscap in the
grei unholi light look distort and unnatur as it doe dure an
eclips of the sun
goroko the witchdoctor stare round him snif the air and then
remark ocularli that it wa wizard weather and that there were
mani spirit about upon my word i felt inclin to agre with him for
my feel were veri uncomfort but i onli repli that if so i
should be oblig if he as a profession would be good enough to keep
them off me of cours i knew that electr charg were about which
account for my sensat and wish that i had never left the camp
it wa dure on of these period of dens gloom that ayesha must have
arriv upon the review ground at least when it lift there she
wa in her white garment surround by women and guard engag
appar in make an orat for although i could not hear a word i
could see by the motion of her arm that she wa speak
had she been the central figur in some stage scene no limelight could
have set her off to better advantag than did those of the heaven
abov her suddenli through the blanket of cloud flow from a hole
in it that look like an ey came a bloodr rai which fell full upon
her so that she alon wa fierc visibl whilst all around wa gloom
in which shape move dimli certainli she look strang and even
terrifi in that red rai which stain her robe till i who had but
just come out of battl with it confus nois began to think of
the garment roll in blood of which i often read in my favourit old
testament for crimson wa she from head to foot a tall shape of terror
and of wrath
the ey in heaven shut and the rai went out then came on of the space
of grei light and in it i saw men be brought up appar from the
group of prison under guard and to the number of a dozen or more
stood in a line befor ayesha
then i saw noth more for a long while becaus black seem to
flow in from everi quarter of the heaven and to block out the scene
beneath at least after a paus of perhap five minut dure which
the still wa intens the storm broke
it wa a veri curiou storm in all my experi of african tempest i
cannot recal on which it resembl it began with the usual cold and
wail wind thi di awai and suddenli the whole arch of heaven wa
aliv with littl lightn that seem to strike horizont not
downward to the earth weav a web of fire upon the surfac of the
sky
by the illumin of these lightn which but for the swift of
their flash and greater intens somewhat resembl a dens shower
of shoot star i perceiv that ayesha wa address the men that
had been brought befor her who stood dejectedli in a long line with
their head bent quit unattend sinc their guard had fallen back
if i were go to receiv a reward of cattl or wive i should look
happier than those moonworshipp baa remark han reflect
perhap it would depend i answer upon what the cattl and wive
were like if the cattl had redwat and would bring diseas into your
herd or wild bull that would gore you and the wive were skinni old
widow with evil tongu then i think you would look as do those men
han
i dont quit know what made me speak thu but i believ it wa some
sens of pend death or disast suggest probabl by the omin
charact of the set provid by natur to the curiou drama of
which we were wit
i never thought of that baa comment han but it is true that
all gift ar not good especi witch gift
as he spoke the littl netlik lightn di awai leav behind
them a gross dark through which far abov us the wind wail
again
then suddenli all the heaven wa turn into on blaze of light and by
it i saw ayesha stand tall and rigid with her hand point toward
the line of men in front of her the blaze went out to be follow by
black and to return almost instantli in a yet fiercer blaze which
seem to fall earthward in a torrent of fire that concentr itself
in a kind of flamespout upon the spot where ayesha stood
through that flame or rather in the heart of it i saw ayesha and the
file of men in front of her as the great king saw the prophet in the
midst of the furnac that had been heat sevenfold onli these men did
not walk about in the fire no thei fell backward while ayesha alon
remain upon her feet with outstretch hand
next came more black and crash upon crash of such thunder that the
earth shook as it reverber from the mountain cliff never in my
life did i hear such fear thunder it frighten the zulu so much
that thei fell upon their face except goroko and umslopogaa whose
pride kept them upon their feet the former becaus he had a reput
to preserv as a heavenherd or master of tempest
i confess that i should have like to follow their exampl and lie
down be dreadfulli afraid lest the lightn should strike me but
therei did not
at last the thunder di awai and in the most mysteri fashion that
violent tempest came to a sudden end as doe a storm upon the stage no
rain fell which in itself wa surpris enough and most unusu
but in place of it a garment of the completest calm descend upon
the earth by degre too the dark pass and the wester sun
reappear it rai fell upon the place where the amahagg compani
had stood but now not on of them wa to be seen
thei were all gone and ayesha with them so complet had thei vanish
awai that i should have thought that we suffer from illus were
it not for the line of dead men which lai there look veri small and
lonesom on the veld mere dot inde at that distanc
we stare at each other and at them and then goroko said that he would
like to inspect the bodi to learn whether lightn kill at kr as
it did elsewher also whether it had smitten them altogeth or leapt
from man to man thi as a profession heavenherd he declar he
could tell from the mark upon these unfortun
as i wa curiou also and want to make a few observ i
consent so with the except of the wound men who i thought
should avoid the exert we scrambl down the dbri of the tumbl
wall and across the open space beyond reach the scene of the tragedi
without meet or see anyon
there lai the dead eleven of them in an exact line as thei had stood
thei were all upon their back with widelyopen ey and an express
of great fear frozen upon their face some of these i recognis as
did umslopogaa and han thei were soldier or captain who had march
under me to attack rezu although until thi moment i had not seen ani
of them after we began to descend the ridg where the battl took place
baa said han i believ that these were the traitor who slip
awai and told rezu of our plan so that he attack us on the ridg
instead of our attack him on the plain as we had arrang so nice
at least thei were none of them in the battl and afterward i heard the
amahagg talk of some of them
i remark that if so the lightn had discrimin veri well in thi
instanc
meanwhil goroko wa examin the bodi on by on and present
call out
these doom on di not by lightn but by witchcraft there is not
a burn upon on of them nor ar their garment scorch
i went to look and found that it wa perfectli true to all outward
appear the eleven were quit unmark and unharm except for their
frighten air thei might have di a natur death in their sleep
doe lightn alwai scorch i ask goroko
alwai macumazahn he answer that is if he who ha been struck
is kill as these ar and not onli stun moreov most of yonder
dead wear knive which should have melt or shatter with the sheath
burnt off them yet those knive ar as though thei had just left the
smith hammer and the whetston and he drew some of them to show me
again it wa quit true and here i mai remark that my experi talli
with that of goroko sinc i have never seen anyon kill by lightn
on whom or on whose cloth there wa not some trace of it passag
ow said umslopogaa thi is witchcraft not heavenwrath the
place is enchant let us get awai lest we be smitten also who have not
earn doom like those traitor
no need to fear said han sinc with us is the great medicin of
zikali which can tie up the lightn as an old woman doe a bundl of
stick
still i observ that for all hi confid han himself wa the
first to depart and with consider speed so we went back to our camp
without more convers sinc the zulu were scare and i confess
that myself i could not understand the matter though no doubt it
admit of some quit simpl explan
howev that might be thi kr wa a queer place with it legend it
sullen amahagg and it mysteri queen to whom at time in spite of
my inner convict to the contrari i wa still inclin to attribut
power beyond those that ar common even among veri beauti and abl
women
thi reflect remind me that she had promis us a further
exhibit of those power and within an hour or two rememb thi
i began to regret that i had ever ask for ani such manifest for
who knew what these might or might not involv
so much did i regret it that i determin unless ayesha sent for us as
she had said she would do i would conveni forget the appoint
luckili umslopogaa seem to be of the same wai of think at ani
rate he went off to eat hi even meal without allud to it at all
so i made up my mind that i would not bring the matter to hi notic and
have ascertain that inez wa still asleep i follow hi exampl
and dine myself though without ani particular appetit
as i finish the sun wa set in a perfectli clear sky so as there
wa no sign of ani messeng i thought that i would go to bed earli
leav order that i wa not to be disturb but on thi point my luck
wa lack for just as i had taken off my coat han arriv and said
that old billali wa without and had come to take me somewher
well there wa noth to do but to put it on again befor i had
finish thi oper billali himself arriv with undignifi
and unusu hast i ask him what wa the matter and he answer
inconsequ that the black on the slayer of rezu wa at the door
with hi ax
that gener accompani him i repli then rememb the caus
of billali alarm i explain to him that he must not take too much
notic of a few hasti word spoken by an essenti gentlenatur
person whose nerv had given wai beneath provoc and bodili effort
the old fellow bow in assent and stroke hi beard but i notic that
while umslopogaa wa near he clung to me like a shadow perhap he
thought that nervou attack might be recurr like those of fever
outsid the hous i found umslopogaa lean on hi ax and look at
the sky in which the last red rai of even linger
the sun ha set macumazahn he said and it is time to visit thi
white queen as she bade us and to learn whether she can inde lead us
down below where the dead ar said to dwell
so he had not forgotten which wa disconcert to cover up my own
doubt i ask him with affect confid and cheer whether he
wa not afraid to risk thi journei down below that is to the realm
of death
why should i fear to tread a road that await the feet of all of us
and at the gate of which we knock dai by dai especi if we chanc
to live by war as do you and i macumazahn he inquir with a quiet
digniti which made me feel asham
why inde i answer ad to myself though i should much prefer
ani other highwai
after thi we start without more word i keep up my spirit by
reflect that the whole busi wa nonsens and that there could be
noth to dread
all too soon we pass the ruin archwai and were admit into
ayesha presenc in the usual fashion as billali who remain outsid
of them drew the curtain behind us i observ to my astonish
that han had sneak in after me and squat down quit close to
them appar in the hope of be overlook
it seem as i gather later that somehow or other he had guess or
becom awar of the object of our visit and that hi burn curios
had overcom hi terror of the white witch or possibl he hope to
discov whether or not she were so ugli as he suppos her veilhidden
face to be at ani rate there he wa and if ayesha notic him as i
think she did for i saw by the motion of her head that she wa look
in hi direct she made no remark
for a while she sat still in her chair contempl us both then she
said
how come it that you ar late those that seek their lost love should
run with eager feet but your have tarri
i mutter some excus to which she did not troubl to listen for she
went on
i think allan that your sandal which should be wing like to those
of the roman mercuri ar weight with the grei lead of fear well it
is not strang sinc you have come to travel through the gate of death
that ar fear by all even by ayesha self for who know what he mai
find beyond them ask the axebear if he also is afraid
i obei render all that she had said into the zulu idiom as best i
could
sai to the queen answer umslopogaa when he understood that i
fear noth except women tongu i am readi to pass the gate of
death and if need be to come back no more with the white peopl
i know it is otherwis becaus of some dark teach to which thei
listen that tell of terror to be such as we who ar black do not
dread still we believ that there ar ghost and that the spirit of
our father live on and as it chanc i would learn whether thi is so
who abov all thing desir to met a certain ghost for which reason i
journei to thi far land
sai these thing to the white queen macumazahn and tell her that if
she should send me to a place whenc there is no return i who do not
love the world shall not blame her overmuch though it is true that i
should have chosen to die in war now i have spoken
when i had pass on all thi speech to ayesha her comment on it wa
thi black captain ha a spirit as brave as hi bodi but how is it
with your spirit allan ar you also prepar to risk so much learn
that i can promis you noth save that when i loos the bond of your
mortal and send out your soul to wander in the depth of death as
i believ that i can do though even of thi i am not certainy
must pass through a gate of terror that mai be close behind you by a
stronger arm than mine moreov what you will find beyond it i do not
know sinc be sure of thi each of us ha hi own heaven or hi own
hell or both that soon or late he is doom to travel now will you go
forward or go back make choic while there is still time
at all thi omin talk i felt my heart shrivel like a firewith
leaf if i mai us that figur and my blood assum the temperatur
and consist of icecream earnestli did i curs myself for have
allow my curios about matter which we ar not meant to understand
to bring me to the edg of such a choic swiftli i determin to
temporis which i did by ask ayesha whether she would accompani me
upon thi eeri expedit
she laugh a littl as she answer
bethink you allan am i whose face you have seen a meet companion
for a man who desir to visit the love that onc were hi what would
thei sai or think if thei should see you hand in hand with such a on
i dont know and dont care i repli desper but thi is the
kind of journei on which on requir a guid who know the road cannot
umslopogaa go first and come back to tell me how it ha fare with
him
if the brave and instruct white lord panopli in the world last
faith is not asham to throw the savag in hi ignor out like a
feather to test the wind of hell and watch the while to learn whether
these blow him back unscorch or waft him into fire whenc there is
no return perchanc it might so be order allan ask him yourself
allan if he is will to run thi errand for your sake or perhap the
littl yellow man and she paus
at thi point han who have a smatter of arab understood
someth of our talk could contain himself no longer
no baa he broke in from hi corner by the curtain not me i
dont care for hunt spook baa which leav no spoor that you can
follow and ar alwai behind when you think thei ar in front also
there ar too mani of them wait for me down there and how can i stand
up to them until i am a spook myself and know their wai of fight
also if you should die when your spirit is awai i want to be left that
i mai buri you nice
be silent i said in my sternest manner then unabl to bear more of
ayesha mockeri for i felt that as usual she wa mock me i ad
with all the digniti that i could command
i am readi to make thi journei through the gate of death ayesha if
inde you can show me the road for on purpos and no other i came to
kr name to learn if so i might whether those who have di upon
the world live on elsewher now what must i do
chapter xxi
the lesson
ye answer ayesha laugh veri softli for that purpos alon
o truthseek allan whose curios is so fierc that the wide world
cannot hold it did you come to kr and not to seek wealth or new land
or to fight more savag no not even to look upon a certain ayesha
of whom the old wizard told you though i think you have alwai love to
try to lift the veil that hide women heart if not their face yet
it wa i who brought you to kr for my own purpos not your desir
nor zikali map and talisman sinc had not the white ladi who li
sick been stolen by rezu never would you have pursu the journei nor
found the wai hither
how could you have had anyth to do with that busi i ask
testili for my nerv were on edg and i said the first thing that came
into my mind
that allan is a question over which you will wonder for a long while
either beneath or beyond the sun as you will wonder concern much
that ha to do with me which your littl mind shut in it iron box of
ignor and pride cannot understand todai
for exampl you have been wonder i am sure how the lightn
kill those eleven men whose bodi you went to look on an hour or two
ago and left the rest untouch well i will tell you at onc that it
wa not lightn that kill them although the strength within me
wa manifest to you in storm but rather what that witchdoctor of your
follow call wizardri becaus thei were traitor who betrai your
armi to rezu i kill them with my wrath and by the wand of my power
oh you do not believ yet perhap er long you will sinc thu to
fulfil your prayer i must also kill youalmost that is the troubl
allan to kill you outright would be easi but to kill you just enough
to set your spirit free and yet leav on crevic of mortal life through
which it can creep back again that is most difficult a thing that onli
i can do and even of myself i am not sure
prai do not try the experi i began thoroughli alarm but she
cut me short
disturb me no more allan with the tremor and chang of your
uncertain mind lest you should work more evil than you think and
make mine uncertain also spoil my skill nai do not try to fly for
alreadi the net ha thrown itself about you and you cannot stir who
ar bound like a littl gild wasp in the spider web or like bird
beneath the ey of basilisk
thi wa true for i found that strive as i would i could not move a
limb or even an eyelid i wa frozen to that spot and there wa noth
for it except to curs my folli and sai my prayer
all thi while she went on talk but of what she said i have not
the faintest idea becaus my remain wit were absorb in these
muchneed implor
present of a sudden i appear to see ayesha seat in a templ
for there were column about her and behind her wa an altar on which
a fire burn all round her too were hood snake like to that which
she wore about her middl fashion in gold to these snake she sang
and thei danc to her sing ye with flicker tongu thei danc
upon their tail what the scene signifi i cannot conceiv unless it
meant that thi mistress of magic wa consult her familiar
then that vision vanish and ayesha voic began to seem veri far awai
and dreami also her wondrou beauti becam visibl to me through her
veil as though i had acquir a new sens that overcam the limit
of mortal sight even in thi extrem i reflect it wa well that the
last thing i look on should be someth so gloriou no not quit
the last thing for out of the corner of my ey i saw that umslopogaa
from a sit posit had sunk on to hi back and lai appar
dead with hi ax still grip tightli and held abov hi head as
though hi arm had been turn to ic
after thi terribl thing began to happen to me and i becam awar that
i wa dy a great wind seem to catch me up and blow me to and fro
as a leaf is blown in the eddi of a winter gale enorm rush of
dark flow over me to be succeed by vivid burst of bright
that dazzl like lightn i fell off precipic and at the foot of
them wa caught by some fear strength and toss to the veri ski
from those ski i wa hurl down again into a kind of whirlpool of
inki night round which i spun perpetu as it seem for hour and
hour but worst of all wa the aw loneli from which i suffer
it seem to me as though there were no other live thing in all the
univers and never had been and never would be ani other live thing i
felt as though i were the univers rush solitari through space for
ag upon ag in a frantic search for fellowship and find none
then someth seem to grip my throat and i knew that i had diedfor
the world float awai from beneath me
now fear and everi mortal sensat left me to be replac by a new and
spiritu terror i or rather my disembodi conscious seem to
come up for judgment and the horror of it wa that i appear to be my
own judg there a veri embodi of cold justic my spirit
grown lumin sat upon a throne and to it with dread and merciless
particular i set out all my misde it wa as if some part of me
remain mortal for i could see my two ey my mouth and my hand but
noth elseand strang enough thei look from the ey came tear
from the mouth flow word and the hand were join as though in
prayer to that throne and adamantin spirit which wa me
it wa as though thi spirit were ask how my bodi had serv
it purpos and advanc it mighti end and in replyoh what a
miser tale i had to tell fault upon fault weak upon weak
sin upon sin never befor did i understand how black wa my record i
tri to reliev the pictur with some incid of attempt good but
that spirit would not hearken it seem to sai that it had gather up
the good and knew it all it wa of the evil that it would learn not
of the good that had better it but of the evil by which it had been
harm
hear thi there rose up in my conscious some memori of what
ayesha had said name that the bodi live within the templ of the
spirit which is oft defi and not the spirit in the bodi
the stori wa told and i hearken for the judgment my own judgment on
myself which i knew would be accept without question and regist
for good or ill but none came sinc er the balanc sank thi wai or
that er it could be utter i wa swept afar
through infin i wa swept and as i fled faster than the light the
mean of what i had seen came home to me i knew or seem to know
for the first time that at the last man must answer to himself
or perhap to a divin principl within himself that out of hi own
freewil through long on and by a million step he climb or sink
to the height or depth dormant in hi natur that from what he wa
spring what he is and what he is engend what he shall be for ever
and ay
now i envisag immort and splendid and aw wa it face it
clasp me to it breast and in the vast circl of it arm i wa
upborn i who knew myself to be without begin and without end
and yet of the past and of the futur knew noth save that these were
full of mysteri
as i went i encount other or overtook them make the same
journei robertson swept past me and spoke but in a tongu i could
not understand i note that the mad had left hi ey and that hi
finecut featur were calm and spiritu the other wander i did not
know
i came to a region of blind light the thought rose in me that i
must have reach the sun or a sun though i felt no heat i stood in a
love shine vallei about which burn mountain of fire there were
huge tree in that vallei but thei glow like gold and their flower
and fruit were as though thei had been fashion of manycolour
flame
the place wa gloriou beyond compar but veri strang to me and not
to be describ i sat me down upon a boulder which burn like a rubi
whether with heat or colour i do not know by the edg of a stream that
flow with what look like fire and made a love music i stoop
down and drank of thi water of flame and the scent and the tast of it
were as those of the costliest wine
there beneath the spread limb of a firetre i sat and examin
the strang flower that grew around colour like rich jewel and
perfum abov imagin there were bird also which might have been
feather with sapphir rubi and amethyst and their song wa so
sweet that i could have wept to hear it the scene wa wonder
and fill me with exalt for i thought of the land where it is
promis that there shall be no more night
peopl began to appear men women and even children though whenc
thei came i could not see thei did not fly and thei did not walk thei
seem to drift toward me as unguid boat drift upon the tide
on and all thei were veri beauti but their beauti wa not human
although their shape and face resembl those of men and women made
gloriou none were old and except the children none seem veri
young it wa as though thei had grown backward or forward to middl
life and rest there at their veri best
now came the marvel all these uncount peopl were known to me though
so far as my knowledg went i had never set ey on most of them befor
yet i wa awar that in some forgotten life or epoch i had been intim
with everi on of them also that it wa the fact of my presenc and
the call of my subconsci mind which drew them to thi spot yet
that presenc and that call were not visibl or audibl to them who
i suppos flow down some stream of sympathi why or whither thei did
not know had i been as thei were perchanc thei would have seen me
as it wa thei saw noth and i could not speak and tell them of my
presenc
some of thi multitud howev i knew well enough even when thei had
depart year and year ago but about these i note thi that everi
on of them wa a man or a woman or a child for whom i had felt love or
sympathi or friendship not on wa a person whom i had dislik or whom
i had no wish to see again if thei spoke at all i could not hearor
readtheir speech yet to a certain extent i could hear their thought
mani of these were beyond the power of my appreci on subject which
i had no knowledg or that were too high for me but some were of quit
simpl thing such as concern us upon the earth such as of friendship
or learn or journei made or to be made or art or literatur or
the wonder of natur or of the fruit of the earth as thei knew them
in thi region
thi i note too that each separ thought seem to be hallow and
enclos in an atmospher of prayer or heavenli aspir as a seed is
enclos in the heart of a flower or a fruit in it odor rind and
that thi prayer or aspir present appear to bear the thought
awai whither i knew not moreov all these thought even of the
humblest thing were beauteou and spiritu noth cruel or impur
or even coars wa to be found among them thei radiat chariti puriti
and good
among them i perceiv were none that had to do with our earth thi and
it affair seem to be left far behind these thinker a truth that
chill my soul wa alien to their compani wors still so far as i
could discov although i knew that all these bright on had been near
to me at some hour in the measur of time and space not on of
their muse dwelt upon me or on aught with which i had to do
between me and them there wa a great gulf fix and a high wall built
oh look on came shine like a star and from far awai came anoth
with dovelik ey and beauti exceedingli and with thi last a
maiden whose ey were as her who my own heart told me wa her mother
well i knew them both thei were those whom i had come to seek the
women who had been mind upon the earth and at the sight of them my
spirit thrill sure thei would discov me sure at least thei
would speak of me and feel my presenc
but although thei stai within a pace or two of where i rest ala
it wa not so thei seem to kiss and to exchang swift thought about
mani thing high thing of which i will not write and common thing
ye even of the shine robe thei wore but never a on of me i
strove to rise and go to them but could not i strove to speak and
could not i strove to throw out my thought to them and could not it
fell back upon my head like a stone hurl heavenward
thei were remot from me utterli apart i wept tear of bitter that
i should be so near and yet so far a dull and jealou rage burn in
my heart and thi thei did seem to feel or so i fanci at ani rate
appar by mutual consent thei move further from me as though
someth pain them ye my love could not reach their perfect
natur but my anger hurt them
as i sat chew thi root of bitter a man appear a veri nobl
man in whom i recognis my father grown younger and happierlook
but still my father with whom came other men and women whom i knew
to be my brother and sister who had di in youth far awai in
oxfordshir joi leapt up in me for i thoughtthes will sure know
me and give me welcom sinc though here sex ha lost it power blood
must still call to blood
but it wa not so thei spoke or interchang their thought but not
on of me i read someth that pass from my father to them it wa
a specul as to what had brought them all togeth there and read
also the answer hazard that perhap it might be to give welcom to
some unknown who wa draw near from below and would feel lone and
unfriend thereon my father repli that he did not see or feel thi
wander and thought that it could not be so sinc it wa hi mission
to greet such on their come
then in an instant all were gone and that love glow plain wa
empti save for myself seat on the rubylik stone weep tear of
blood and shame and loss within my soul
so i sat a long while till present i wa awar of a new presenc a
presenc duski and splendid and arrai in rich barbar robe straight
she came toward me like a thrown spear and i knew her for a
certain royal and savag woman who on earth wa name mameena or
windthatwail moreov she divin me though see me she could
not
art there watcherinthenight watch in the light she said or
thought i know not which but the word came to me in the zulu tongu
ay she went on i know that thou art there from ten thousand
leagu awai i felt thy presenc and broke from my own place to welcom
thee though i must pai for it with burn chain and bondag how did
those welcom thee whom thou camest out to seek did thei clasp thee in
their arm and press their kiss on thy brow or did thei shrink awai
from thee becaus the smell of earth wa on thy hand and lip
i seem to answer that thei did not appear to know that i wa there
ay thei did not know becaus their love is not enough becaus thei
have grown too fine for love but i the sinner i knew well and here
am i readi to suffer all for thee and to give thee place within thi
stormi heart of mine forget them then and come to rule with me who
still am queen in my own hous that thou shalt share there we will live
royal and when our hour come at least we shall have had our dai
now befor i could repli some power seem to seiz thi splendid
creatur and whirl her thenc so that she depart flash these word
from her mind to mine
for a littl while farewel but rememb alwai that mameena the
wail wind be still as a sin woman in a woman love and of
the earth earthi found thee whom all the rest forgot o
watcherinthenight watch in the night for me for there thou shalt
find me the child of storm again and yet again
she wa gone and onc more i sat in utter solitud upon that rubi stone
stare at the jewel flower and the gloriou flame tree and the
lambent water of the brook what wa the mean of it all i wonder
and why wa i desert by everyon save a singl savag woman and why
had she a power to find me which wa deni to all the rest well
she had given me an answer becaus she wa as a sin woman with
a woman love and of the earth earthi while with the rest it wa
otherwis oh thi wa clear that in the heaven man ha no friend
among the heavenli save perhap the greatest friend of all who
understand both flesh and spirit
thu i muse in thi burn world which wa still so beauti thi
alien world into which i had thrust myself unwant and unsought
and while i muse thi happen the fieri water of the stream were
disturb by someth and look up i saw the caus
a dog had plung into them and wa swim toward me at a glanc
i knew that dog on which my ey had not fallen for decad it wa a
mongrel half spaniel and half bullterri which for year had been
the dear friend of my youth and di at last on the horn of a wound
wildebeest that attack me when i had fallen from my hors upon
the veld boldli it tackl the madden buck thu give me time to
scrambl to my rifl and shoot it but not befor the poor hound had
yield it life for mine sinc present it di disembowel but
lick my hand and forget of it agoni thi dog smut by name it
wa that swam or seem to swim the brook of fire it scrambl to the
hither shore it nose the earth and ran to the rubi stone and stare
about it whine and snif
at last it seem to see or feel me for it stood upon it hind leg
and lick my face yelp with mad joi as i could see though i
heard noth now i wept in earnest and bent down to hug and kiss the
faith beast but thi i could not do sinc like myself it wa onli
shadow
then suddenli all dissolv in a cataract of manycolour flame and i
fell down into an infinit gulf of black
sure ayesha wa talk to me what did she sai what did she sai i
could not catch her word but i caught her laughter and knew that after
her fashion she wa make a mock of me my eyelid were drag down
as though with heavi sleep it wa difficult to lift them at last thei
were open and i saw ayesha seat on her couch befor me andthi i
note at oncewith her love face unveil i look about me seek
umslopogaa and han but thei were gone as i guess thei must be
sinc otherwis ayesha would not have been unveil we were quit
alon she wa address me and in a new fashion sinc now she
had abandon the formal you and wa us the more impress and
intim thou much as is the manner of the french
thou hast made thy journei allan she said and what thou hast
seen there thou shalt tell me present yet from thy mien i gather
thisthat thou art glad to look upon flesh and blood again and after
the compani of spirit to find that of mortal woman come then and sit
besid me and tell thy tale
where ar the other i ask as i rose slowli to obei for my head
swam and my feet seem feebl
gone allan who as i think have had enough of ghost which is perhap
thy case also come drink thi and be a man onc more drink it to me
whose skill and power have brought thee safe from land that human feet
were never meant to tread and take a strangeshap cup from a stool
that stood besid her she offer it to me
i drank to the last drop neither know nor care whether it were
wine or poison sinc my heart seem desper at it failur and my
spirit crush beneath the weight of it great betray i suppos it
wa the former for the content of that cup ran through my vein like
fire and gave me back my courag and the joi of life
i step to the dai and sat me down upon the couch lean against
it round end so that i wa almost face to face with ayesha who had
turn toward me and thenc could studi her unveil loveli for a
while she said noth onli ei me up and down and smile and smile
as though she were wait for that wine to do it work with me
now that thou art a man again allan tell me what thou didst see when
thou wast moreor lessthan man
so i told her all for some power within her seem to draw the truth
out of me nor did the tale appear to caus her much surpris
there is truth in thy dream she said when i had finish a lesson
also
then it wa all a dream i interrupt
is not everyth a dream even life itself allan if so what can
thi be that thou hast seen but a dream within a dream and itself
contain other dream as in the old dai the ball fashion by the
eastern worker of ivori would oft be found to contain anoth ball and
thi yet anoth and anoth and anoth till at the inmost might be
found a bead of gold or perchanc a jewel which wa the prize of him
who could draw out ball from ball and leav them all unbroken that
search wa difficult and rare wa the jewel come by if at all so
that some said there wa none save in the maker mind ye i have
seen a man go craze with seek and die with the mysteri unsolv how
much harder then is it to come at the diamond of truth which li at
the core of all our nest of dream and without which to rest upon thei
could not be fashion to seem realiti
but wa it realli a dream and if so what were the truth and the
lesson i ask determin not to allow her to bemus or escap me
with her metaphys talk and illustr
the first question ha been answer allan as well as i can answer
who am not the architect of thi great globe of dream and as yet
cannot clearli see the ineff gem within whose prison rai
illumin their substanc though so dimli that onli those with the
insight of a god can catch their glamour in the night of thought sinc
to most thei ar dark as glowfli in the glare of noon
then what ar the truth and the lesson i persist perceiv that
it wa hopeless to extract from her an opinion as to the real natur of
my experi and that i must content myself with her deduct from
them
thou tellest me allan that in thy dream or vision thou didst seem to
appear befor thyself seat on a throne and in that self to find thy
judg that is the truth whereof i spoke though how it found it wai
through the black and ignor shell of on whose wit is so small
is more than i can guess sinc i believ that it wa reveal to me
alon
now i allan thought to myself that i began to see the origin of all
these fantasi and that for onc ayesha had made a slip if she had a
theori and i develop that same theori in a hypnot condit it wa
not difficult to guess it fount howev i kept my mouth shut and
luckili for onc she did not seem to read my mind perhap becaus she
wa too much occupi in spin her smooth web of entangl word
all men worship their own god she went on and yet seem not to know
that thi god dwell within them and that of him thei ar a part there
he dwell and there thei mould him to their own fashion as the potter
mould hi clai though whatev the shape he seem to take beneath
their finger still he remain the god infinit and unalter still
he is the seeker and the sought the prayer and it fulfil the love
and the hate the virtu and the vice sinc all these qualiti the
alchemi of hi spirit turn into an ultim and etern good for the
god is in all thing and all thing ar in the god whom men cloth with
such divers garment and whose counten thei hide beneath so mani
mask
in the tree flow the sap yet what know the great tree it nurtur of
the sap in the world womb burn the fire that give life yet what of
the fire know the gloriou earth it conceiv and will destroi in the
heaven the great globe swing through space and rest not yet what know
thei of the strength that sent them spin and in a time to come will
stai their mighti motion or turn them to anoth cours therefor of
everyth thi allpres god is judg or rather not on but mani
judg sinc of each live creatur he make it own magistr to
deal out justic accord to that creatur law which in the begin
the god establish for it and decre thu in the breast of everyon
there is a rule and by that rule at work through a countless chain of
live in the end he shall be lift up to heaven or bound about and
cast down to hell and death
you mean a conscienc i suggest rather feebli for her thought and
imag overpow me
ay a conscienc if thou wilt and canst onli understand that term
though it fit my theme but ill thi is my mean that conscienc
as thou namest them ar mani i have on thou allan hast anoth
that black axebear ha a third the littl yellow man a fourth and
so on through the tale of live thing for even a dog such as thou
sawest ha a conscienc andlik thyself or imust in the end be it
own judg becaus of the spark that come to it from abov the same
spark which in me burn as a great fire and in thee as a smoulder
ember of green wood
when you sit in judgment on yourself in a dai to come ayesha
i could not help interpol i trust that you will rememb that
humil did not shine among your virtu
she smile in her vivid wayonli twice or thrice did i see her smile
thu and then it wa like a flash of summer lightn illumin a
cloud sky sinc for the most part her face wa grave and even sombr
well answer she said goad the patient ox enough and even it will
grow fierc and paw the ground
humil what have i to do with it o allan let humil be the part
of the humblesoul and lowli but for those who reign as i do and
thei ar few inde let there be pride and the glori thei have earn
now i have told thee of the truth thou sawest in thy vision and wouldst
thou hear the lesson
ye i answer sinc i mai as well be done with it at onc and
doubtless it will be good for me
the lesson allan is on which thou preachesthumil vain man
and foolish as thou art thou didst desir to travel the underworld in
search of certain on who onc were all in all to theenai not all in
all sinc of them there were two or morebut at least much thu thou
wouldst do becaus as thou saidest thou didst seek to know whether
thei still live on beyond the gate of black ye thou saidest
thi but what thou didst hope to learn in truth wa whether thei live
on in thee and for thee onli for thou thou in thy vaniti didst
pictur these depart soul as do naught in that heaven thei had
won save think of thee still burrow on the earth and at time
lighten thy labour with kiss from other lip than their
never i exclaim indignantli never it is not true
then i prai pardon allan who onli judg of thee by other that were
as men ar made and be such not to be blame if perchanc from time
to time thei turn to look on women who ala were as thei ar made
so at least it wa when i knew the world but mayhap sinc then it
richest wine ha turn to water wherebi i hope it ha been better
at the least thi wa thy thought that those women who had been thine
for an hour through all etern could dream of naught els save thy
perfect and hope for naught els than to see thee at their side
through that etern or such part of thee as thou couldst spare to
each of them for thou didst forget that where thei have gone there
mai be other even more peerless than thou art and more fit to hold a
woman love which as we know on earth wa ever chang and perhap
mai so remain where it is certain that new light must shine and new
desir beckon dost understand me allan
i think so i answer with a groan i understand you to mean that
worldli impress soon wear out and that peopl who have depart to
other sphere mai there form new ti and forget the old
ye allan as do those who remain upon thi earth whenc these other
have depart do men and women still remarri in the world allan as
in my dai thei were wont to do
of courseit is allow
as mani other thing or perchanc thi same thing mai be allow
elsewher for when there ar so mani habit from which to choos
why should we alwai dwell in on of them howev strait the hous or
poor the prospect
now understand that i wa symbolis by the strait hous and the
poor prospect i should have grown angri had not a certain sens of
humour come to my rescu who rememb that after all ayesha satir
wa profoundli true why beyond the earth should anyon desir
to remain unalter ti to and inextric wrap up in such a
person as my own especi if other of superior textur abound
about them now that i came to think of it the thing wa absurd and
not to be the least expect in the midst of a thousand new and vivid
interest i had met with on more disillusion that wa all
dost understand allan went on ayesha who evid wa determin
that i should drink thi cup to the last drop that these dweller in
the sun or the far planet where thou hast been accord to thy tale
saw thee not and knew naught of thee it mai chanc therefor that at
thi time thou wast not in their mind which at other dream of thee
continu or it mai chanc that thei never dream of thee at all
have quit forgotten thee as the wean cub forget it mother
at least there wa on who seem to rememb i exclaim for her
poison mock stung the word out of me on woman anda dog
ay the savag who be natur child a sinner that depart henc
by her own act how ayesha knew thi i cannot sai i never told her
ha not yet put on perfect and therefor still rememb him whose
kiss wa last upon her lip but sure allan it is not thy desir
to pass from the gentl order clasp of those white soul for the
tumultu arm of such a on as thi still let that be for who know
what men will or will not do in jealousi and disappoint love and the
dog it rememb also and even sought thee out sinc dog ar more
faith and singleheart than is mankind there at least thou hast
thy lesson name to grow more humbl and never to think again that
thou holdest all a woman soul for ay becaus onc she wa kind to
thee for a littl while on earth
ye i answer jump up in a rage as you sai i have my lesson
and more of it than i want so by your leav i will now bid you
farewel hope that when it come to be your turn to learn thi
lesson or a wors ayesha as i am sure it will on dai for someth
tell me so you mai enjoi it more than i have done
chapter xxii
ayesha farewel
thu i spoke whose nerv were on edg after all that i had seen or as
even then i suspect seem to see for how could i believ that these
vision of mine had ani higher origin than ayesha rather malici
imagin alreadi i had form my theori
it wa that she must be a hypnotist of power who after she had put a
spell upon her subject could project into hi mind such fanci as she
chose togeth with a select of her own theori onli two point
remain obscur the first washow did she get the necessari
inform about the privat affair of a humbl individu like
myself for these were not known even to zikali with whom she seem
to be in some kind of correspond or to han at ani rate in such
complet
i could but presum that in some mysteri wai she drew them from or
rather excit them in my own mind and memori so that i seem to see
those with whom onc i had been intim with modif and in
surround that her intellig had carefulli prepar it would not
be difficult for a mind like her familiar as i gather it wa with
the ancient lore of the greek and the egyptian to creat a kind of
hade and by wai of differ to chang it from on of shadow to on
of intens illumin and into it to plung the conscious of him
upon whom she had laid her charm of sleep i had seen noth and heard
noth that she might not thu have mould alwai given that she had
access to the need clai of fact which i alon could furnish
grant thi hypothesi the second point waswhat might be the object
of her elabor and most bitter jest well i thought that i could
guess first she wish to show her power or rather to make me
believ that she had power of a veri unusu sort secondli she ow
umslopogaa and myself a debt for our servic in the war with rezu
which we had been told would be repaid in thi wai thirdli i had
offend her in some fashion and she took her opportun of settl
the score also there wa a fourth possibilitythat realli she
consid herself a moral instructress and desir as she said to
teach me a lesson by show how futil were human hope and vaniti in
respect to the depart and their affect
now i do not pretend that all thi analysi of ayesha motiv occur
to me at the moment of my interview with her inde i onli complet
it later after much care thought when i found it sound and good at
that time although i had inkl i wa too bewild to form a just
judgment
further i wa too angri and it wa from thi bow of my anger that
i loos a shaft at a ventur as to some lesson which await her
perhap certain word spoken by the dy rezu had shape that shaft or
perhap some shadow of her advanc fate fell upon me
the success of the shot howev wa remark evid it pierc
the joint of her har and inde went home to ayesha heart she
turn pale all the peachbloom hue fade from her love face her
great ey seem to lessen and grow dull and her cheek to fall in
inde for a moment she look old veri old quit an ag woman
moreov she wept for i saw two big tear drop upon her white raiment
and i wa horrifi
what ha happen to you i said or rather gasp
naught she answer save that thou hast hurt me sore dost thou not
know allan that it is cruel to prophesi ill to ani sinc such word
feather from fate own wing and barb with venom fester in the
breast and mayhap bring about their own accomplish most cruel of
all is it when with them ar repaid friendship and gentl
i reflect to myselfy friendship of the order that is call
candid and gentl such as is hid in a cat velvet paw but
content myself with ask how it wa that she who said she wa so
power came to fear anyth at all
becaus as i have told thee allan there is no armour that can turn
the spear of destini which when i heard those word of thine it seem
to me i know not why wa direct by thy hand look now on rezu who
thought himself unconquer and yet wa slain by the black axebear
and whose bone tonight stai the famin of the jackal moreov i am
accurs who sought to steal it servant from heaven to be my love and
how know i when and where vengeanc will fall at last inde it ha
fallen alreadi on me who through the long ag amid savag must mourn
widow and alon but not all of itoh i think not all
then she began to weep in good earnest and watch her for the
first time i understood that thi gloriou creatur who seem to be so
power wa after all on of the most miser of women and as much a
prei to loneli everi sort of passion and apprehens fear as can
be ani common mortal if as she said she had found the secret of life
which of cours i did not believ at least it wa obviou that she had
lost that of happi
she sob softli and wept and while she did so the loveli which
had left her for a littl while return to her like light to a grei
and darken sky oh how beauti she seem with the abund lock
in disord over her tearstain face how beauti beyond imagin
my heart melt as i studi her i could think of noth els except
her surpass charm and glori
i prai you do not weep i said it hurt me and inde i am sorri if
i said anyth to give you pain
but she onli shook that gloriou hair further about her face and behind
it veil wept on
you know ayesha i continu you have said mani hard thing to me
make me the target of your bitter wit therefor it is not strang
that at last i answer you
and hast thou not deserv them allan she murmur in soft and
broken tone from behind that veil of scent lock
why i ask
becaus from the begin thou didst defi me show in thine everi
accent that thou heldest me a liar and on of no account in bodi or in
spirit on not worthi of thy kind look or of those gentl word which
onc were my portion among men oh thou hast dealt hardli with me and
therefor perchancei know noti paid thee back with such poor weapon
as a woman hold though all the while i like thee well
then again she fell to sob swai herself gentli to and fro in her
sweet sorrow
it wa too much not know what els to do to comfort her i pat
her ivori hand which lai upon the couch besid me and as thi appear
to have no effect i kiss it which she did not seem to resent then
suddenli i rememb and let it fall
she toss back her hair from her face and fix her big ey on me
said gentli enough look down at her hand
what ail thee allan
oh noth i answer onli i rememb the stori you told me
about some man call kallikr
she frown
and what of kallikr allan is it not enough that for my sin with
tear empti long and repent i must wait for him through all
the weari centuri must i also wear the chain of thi kallikr to
whom i ow mani a debt when he is far awai sai didst thou see him in
that heaven of thine allan for there perchanc he dwell
i shook my head and tri to think the thing out while all the time
those wonder ey of her seem to draw the soul from me it seem
to me that she bent forward and held up her face to me then i lost my
reason and also bent forward ye she made me mad and save her i
forgot all
swiftli she place her hand upon my heart sai
stai what meanest thou dost love me allan
i think sothat isy i answer
she sank back upon the couch awai from me and began to laugh veri
softli
what word ar these she said that thei pass thy lip so easili and
so unmeant perchanc from long practic oh allan i am astonish
art thou the same man who some few dai ago told me and thi unask
that as soon wouldst thou think of court the moon as of court me
art thou he who not a minut gone swore proudli that never had hi heart
and hi lip wander from certain angel whither thei should not and
now and now
i colour to my ey and rose mutter
let me be gone
nai allan why i see no mark here and she held up her hand
scan it carefulli thou art too much what thou wert befor except
perhap in thy soul which is invis she ad with a touch of
malic nor am i angri with thee inde hadst thou not tri to charm
awai my woe i should have thought but poorli of thee as a man there
let it rest and be forgottenor rememb as thou wilt still in
answer to thy word concern my kallikr what of those ador on
that accord to thy tale but now thou didst find again in a place of
light becaus thei seem faithless shouldst thou be faithless also
shame on thee thou fickl allan
she paus wait for me to speak
well i could not i had noth to sai who wa utterli disgrac and
overwhelm
thou thinkest allan she went on that i have cast my net about
thee and thi is true learn wisdom from it allan and never again
defi a womanthat is if she be fair for then she is stronger than
thou art sinc natur for it own purpos made her so whatev i have
done by tear that ancient artific of my sex as in other wai is for
thy instruct allan that thou mayest benefit therebi
again i sprang up utter an english exclam which i trust ayesha
did not understand and again she motion to me to be seat sai
nai leav me not yet sinc even if the light fanci of a man that
come and goe like the even wind and for a breath made me dear
to thee ha pass awai there remain certain work which we must do
togeth although think of thyself alon thou hast forgotten it
have been paid thine own fee on is yet due to that old wizard in a
far land who sent thee to visit kr and me as inde he ha remind me
and within an hour
thi amaz statement arous me from my person and pain
preoccup and caus me to stare at her blankli
again thou disbelievest me she said with a littl stamp do so onc
more allan and i swear ill bring thee to grovel on the ground and
kiss my foot and babbl nonsens to a woman sworn to anoth man such
as never for all thy dai thou shalt think of without a blush of shame
oh no i broke in hurriedli i assur you that you ar mistaken i
believ everi word you have said or sai or will sai i do in truth
now thou liest well what is on more falsehood among so mani let it
pass
what inde i echo in eager affirm and as for zikali
messag and i paus
it wa to recal to my mind that he desir to learn whether a certain
great enterpris of hi will succe the detail of which he sai thou
canst tell me repeat them to me
so glad enough to get awai from more danger topic i narrat
to her as briefli and clearli as i could the histori of the old
witchdoctor feud with the royal hous of zululand she listen
take in everi word and said
so now he yearn to know whether he will conquer or be conquer and
that is why he sent or think that he sent thee on thi journei not
for thy sake allan but for hi own i cannot tell thee for what have
i do to with the finish of thi petti busi which to him seem so
larg still as i ow him a debt for lure the axebear here to rid
me of mine enemi and thee to lighten my solitud for an hour by the
burnish of thy mind i will try set that bowl befor me allan
and she point to a marbl tripod on which stood a basin half full of
water and come sit close by me and look into it tell me what thou
seest
i obei her instruct and present found myself with my head over
the basin stare into the water in the exact attitud of a person who
is about to be shampoo
thi seem rather foolish i said abjectli for at that moment i
resembl the queen of sheba in on particular if in no other name
that there wa no more spirit in me what am i suppos to do i see
noth at all
look again she said and as she spoke the water grew cloud then on
it appear a pictur i saw the interior of a kaffir hut dimli light
by a singl candl set in the neck of a bottl to the left of the door
of the hut wa a bedstead and on it lai stretch a wast and dy
man in whom to my astonish i recognis cetywayo king of the
zulu at the foot of the bed stood anoth manmyself grown older by
mani year and lean over the bed appar whisper into the
dy man ear wa a grotesqu and malevol figur which i knew to
be that of zikali openerofroad whose glow ey were fix upon
the terrifi and tortur face of cetywayo all wa as it happen
afterward as i have written down in the book call finish
i describ what i saw to ayesha and while i wa do so the pictur
vanish awai so that noth remain save the clear water in the
marbl bowl the stori did not seem to interest her inde she lean
back and yawn a littl
thy vision is good allan she said indiffer and wide also
sinc thou canst see what pass in the sun or distant star and
pictur of thing to be in the water to sai noth of other pictur
in a woman ey all within an hour well thi savag busi
concern me not and of it i want to know no more yet it would appear
that here the old wizard who is thy friend ha the answer that he
desir for there in the pictur the king he hate li dy while he
hiss in hi ear and thou dost watch the end what more can he seek
tell him it when ye meet and tell him also it is my will that in futur
he should troubl me less sinc i love not to be waken from my sleep
to listen to hi halfinstruct talk and savag vapour inde
he presum too much and now enough of him and hi dark plot ye have
your desir all of you and ar paid in full
overpaid perhap i said with a sigh
ah allan i think that lesson thou hast learn pleas thee but
littl well be comfort for the thing is common hast never heard
that there is but on morsel more bitter to the tast than desir
deni name desir fulfil believ me that there can be no
happi for man until he attain a land where all desir is dead
that is what the buddha preach ayesha
ay i rememb the doctrin of that wise man well who without doubt
had found a kei to the gate of truth on kei onli for mark thou
allan there ar mani yet man be man must know desir sinc
without them rob of ambit strive hope fear ay and of
life itself the race must die which is not the will of the lord of
life who need a nurseri for hi servant soul wherein hi sword of
good and ill shall shape them to hi pattern so it come about allan
that what we think the worst is oft the best for us and with that
knowledg if we ar wise let us assuag our bitter and wipe awai
our tear
i have often thought that i said
i doubt it not allan sinc though it ha pleas me to make a jest
of thee i know that thou hast thy share of wisdom such littl share as
thou canst gather in thy few short year i know too that thy heart is
good and aspir high and friendwel i find in thee a friend inde
as i think not for the first time nor certainli for the last mark
allan what i sai not a lover but a friend which is higher far
for when passion di with the pass of the flesh if there be no
friendship what will remain save certain memori that mayhap ar well
forgot ay how would those lover meet elsewher who were never more
than lover with weari i hold as thei stare into each other
empti soul or even with disgust
therefor the wise will seek to turn those with whom fate mate them
into friend sinc otherwis soon thei will be lost for ay more if
thei ar wiser still have made them friend thei will suffer them
to find lover where thei will good maxim ar thei not yet hard to
follow or so perchanc thou thinkest thema i do
she grew silent and brood a while rest her chin upon her hand and
stare down the hall thu the aspect of her face wa differ from
ani that i had seen it wear no longer had it the allur of aphrodit or
the majesti of hera rather might it have been that of athen herself
so wise it seem so calm so full of experi and of foresight that
almost it frighten me
what wa thi woman true stori i wonder what her real self and
what the sum of her gather knowledg perhap it wa accid or
perhap again she guess my mind at ani rate her next word seem
in some sens an answer to these specul lift her ey she
contempl me a while then said
my friend we part to meet no more in thy life dai often thou wilt
wonder concern me as to what in truth i am and mayhap in the end
thy judgment will be to write me down some fals and beauteou wander
who reject of the world or driven from it by her crime made
choic to rule among savag plai the part of oracl to that littl
audienc and tell strang tale to such few travel as come her
wai perhap inde i do plai thi part among mani other and if so
thou wilt not judg me wrongli
allan in the old dai marin who had sail the northern sea told
me that therein amidst mist and storm float mountain of ic shed from
dizzi cliff which ar hid in dark where no sun shine thei told
me also that wherea abov the ocean breast appear but a blue and
dazzl point sunk beneath it is oft a whole frozen isl invis to
man
such am i allan of my be thou seest but on littl peak glitter
in light or crown with storm as heaven mood sweep over it but in
the depth beneath ar hid it white and broad foundat hollow by
the sea of time to cavern and to palac which my spirit doth inhabit
so pictur me therefor as wise and fair but with a soul unknown and
prai that in time to come thou mayest see it in it splendour
hadst thou been other than thou art i might have shown thee secret
make clear to thee the parabl of much that i have told thee in
metaphor and vari fabl ay and given thee great gift of power
and endur dai of which thou knowest noth but of those who visit
shrine o allan two thing ar requir worship and faith sinc
without these the oracl ar dumb and the heal water will not flow
now i ayesha am a shrine yet to me thou broughtest no worship until
i won it by a woman trick and in me thou hast no faith therefor for
thee the oracl will not speak and the water of deliver will not
flow yet i blame thee not who art as thou wast made and the hard world
ha shape thee
and so we part think not i am far from thee becaus thou seest me not
in the dai to come sinc like that isi whose majesti alon i still
exercis on earth i whom men name ayesha am in all thing i tell
thee that i am not on but mani and be mani am both here and
everywher when thou standest beneath the sky at night and lookest on
the star rememb that in them mine ey behold thee when the soft
wind of even blow that my breath is on thy brow and when the
thunder roll that there am i ride on the lightn and rush with
the gale
do you mean that you ar the goddess isi i ask bewild
becaus if so why did you tell me that you were but her priestess
have it as thou wilt allan all sound do not reach thine ear all
sight ar not open to thy ey and therefor thou art both half deaf
and blind perchanc now that her shrine ar dust and her worship is
forgot some spark of the spirit of that immort ladi whose chariot wa
the moon linger on the earth in thi woman shape of mine though her
essenc dwell afar and perchanc her other name is natur my mother
and thine o allan at the least hath not the world a souland of that
soul am i not mayhap a part ay and thou also for the rest ar not
the priest and the divin he bow to oft the same
it wa on my lip to answer ye if the priest is a knave or a
selfdeceiv but i did not
farewel allan and let ayesha benison go with thee safe shalt
thou reach thy home for all is prepar to take thee henc and thy
companion with thee safe shalt thou live for mani a year till thy
time come and then perchanc thou wilt find those whom thou hast
lost more kind than thei seem to be tonight
she paus awhil then ad
hearken unto my last word as i have said much that i have told thee
mai bear a doubl mean as is the wai of parabl to be interpret
as thou wilt yet on thing is true i love a certain man in the old
dai name kallikr to whom alon i am appoint by a divin decre
and i await him here oh shouldest thou find him in the world without
tell him that ayesha await him and grow weari in the wait nai
thou wilt never find him sinc even if he be born again by what token
would he be known to thee therefor i charg thee keep my secret
well lest ayesha curs should fall on thee while thou livest tell
naught of me to the world thou knowest dost thou swear to keep my
secret allan
i swear ayesha
i thank thee allan she answer and grew silent for a while
at length ayesha rose and draw herself up to the full of her height
stood there majest next she beckon to me to come near for i too
had risen and left the dai
i obei and bend down she held her hand over me as though in
bless then point toward the curtain which at thi moment were
drawn asund by whom i do not know
i went and when i reach them turn to look my last on her
there she stood as i had left her but now her ey were fix upon the
ground and her face onc more wa brood absent as though no such
a man as i had ever been it came into my mind that alreadi she had
forgotten me the playth of an hour who had serv her turn and been
cast asid
chapter xxiii
what umslopogaa saw
like on who dram i pass down the outer hall where stood the silent
guard as statu might and out through the archwai here i paus for
a moment partli to calm my mind in the familiar surround of the
night and partli becaus i thought that i heard someon approach me
through the gloom and in such a place where i might have mani enemi
it wa well to be prepar
as it chanc howev my imaginari assail wa onli han who
emerg from some place where he had been hide a veri disturb and
frighten han
oh baa he said in a low and shaki whisper i am glad to see you
again and stand on your feet not be carri with them stick
straight in front of you as i expect
why i ask
oh baa becaus of the thing that happen in that place where the
tall vrouw with her head ti up as though she had toothach sit
like a spider in a web
well what happen han i ask as we walk forward
thi baa the doctoress talk and talk at you and umslopogaa and
as she talk your face began to look as though you had drunk half
a flask too much of the best gin such as i wish i had some of here
tonight at onc wise and foolish and full and empti baa then you
both roll over and lai there quit dead and whilst i wa wonder
what i should do and how i should get out your bodi to buri them the
doctoress came down off her platform and bent first over you and next
over umslopogaa whisper into the ear of both of you then she took
off a snake that look as though it were made of gold with green ey
which she wear about her middl beneath the long dishcloth baa and
held it to your lip and next to those of umslopogaa
well and what then han
after that all sort of thing came about baa and i felt as though
the whole hous were travel through the air baa twice as fast as
a bullet doe from a rifl suddenli too the room becam fill with
fire so hot that it scorch me and so bright that it made my ey
water although thei can look at the sun without wink and baa
the fire wa full of spook which walk around ye i saw some of them
stand on your head and stomach baa also on that of umslopogaa
whilst other went and talk to the white doctoress as quietli as
though thei had met her in the marketplac and want to sell her
egg or butter then baa suddenli i saw your reverend father the
predik who look as though he were redhot as doubtless he is in
the place of fire i thought he came up to me baa and said get out
of thi han thi is no place for a good hottentot like you han for
here onli the veri best christian can bear the heat for long
that finish me baa i just answer that i hand you the baa
allan hi son over to hi care hope that he would see that you did
not burn in that oven whatev happen to umslopogaa then i shut my
ey and mouth and held my nose and wriggl beneath those curtain as
a snake doe baa and ran down the hall and across the kraalyard
and through the archwai out into the night where i have been sit
cool myself ever sinc wait for you to be carri awai baa
and now you have come aliv and with not even your hair burnt off which
show how wonder must be the great medicin of zikali baa sinc
noth els could have save you in that fire no not even your
reverend father the predik
han i said when he had finish you ar a veri wonder fellow
for you can get drunk on noth at all pleas rememb han that
you have been drunk tonight ye veri drunk inde and never dare to
repeat anyth that you thought you saw while you were drunk
ye baa i understand that i wa drunk and alreadi have forgotten
everyth but baa there is still a bottl full of brandi and if i
could have just on more tot i should forget so much better
by now we had reach our camp and here i found umslopogaa sit in
the doorwai and stare at the sky
goodeven to you umslopogaa i said in my most unconcern
manner and wait
goodeven watcherbynight who i thought wa lost in the night
sinc in the end the night is stronger than ani of it watcher
at thi cryptic remark i look bewild but said noth at length
umslopogaa whose natur for a zulu wa impuls and lack in the
ordinari nativ patienc ask
did you make a journei thi even macumazahn and if so what did
you see
did you have a dream thi even umslopogaa i inquir by wai of
answer and if so what wa it about i thought that i saw you shut
your ey in the hous of the white on yonder doubtless becaus you
were weari of talk which you did not understand
ay macumazahn as you suppos i grew weari of that talk which flow
from the lip of the white witch like the music that come from a littl
stream babbl over stone when the sun is hot and be weari i fell
asleep and dream what i dream doe not much matter it is enough
to sai that i felt as though i were thrown through the air like a stone
cast from hi sling by a boi who is set upon a stage to scare the bird
out of a meali garden further than ani stone i went ay further
than a shoot star till i reach a wonder place it doe not much
matter what it wa like either and inde i am alreadi begin to
forget but there i met everyon i have ever known i met the lion of
the zulu the black on the earthshak he who had a sister name
baleka which sister here he drop hi voic and look about him
suspici bore a child which child wa foster by on mopo
that mopo who afterward slew the black on with the princ now
macumazahn i had a score to settl with thi black on ay even
though our blood be much of the same colour i had a score to settl
with him becaus of the slai of thi sister of hi baleka togeth
with the langeni tribe so i walk up to him and took him by the
headr and spat in hi face and bade him find a spear and shield and
meet me as man to man ye i did thi
for the histori of baleka the mother of umslopogaa
and mopo see the book call nada the lilyeditor
and what happen then umslopogaa i said when he paus in hi
narr
macumazahn noth happen at all my hand seem to go through hi
headr and the skull beneath and to shut upon itself while he went
on talk to someon els a captain whom i recognis ye on faku
whom in the dai of dingaan the black on brother i myself slew upon
the ghostmountain
ye macumazahn and faku wa tell him the tale of how i kill him
and of the fight that i and my bloodbroth and the wolv made there
on the knee of the old witch who sit aloft on the ghost mountain
wait for the world to die for i could understand their talk though
mine went by them like the wind
macumazahn thei pass awai and there came other dingaan among them
ay dingaan who also know someth of the witchmountain see that
there mopo and i hurl him to hi death with him also i would have had
word but it wa the same stori onli present he caught sight of the
black on ye of chaka whom he slew stab him with the littl
red assegai and turn and fled becaus in that land i think he still
fear chaka macumazahn or so the dream told
i went on and met other men i had fought in my dai most of them
among them wa jikiza he who rule the peopl of the ax befor me whom
i slew with hi own ax i lift the ax and made me readi to fight
again but not on of them took ani note of me there thei walk about
or sat drink beer or take snuff but never a sup of the beer or a
pinch of the snuff did thei offer me no not even those among them whom
i chanc not to have kill so i left them and walk on seek for
mopo my fosterfath and a certain man my bloodbroth by whose
side i hunt with the wolv ye for them and for anoth
well and did you find them i ask
mopo i found not which make me think macumazahn that as onc you
hint to me he whom i thought long dead perchanc still linger on
the earth but the other i did find and he ceas brood
now i knew enough of umslopogaass histori to be awar that he had love
thi man and woman of whom he spoke more than ani other on the earth
the bloodbroth whose name he would not utter by which he did not
mean that he wa hi brother in blood but on with whom he had made
a pact of etern friendship by the interchang of blood or some such
ceremoni accord to report had dwelt with him on the witchmountain
where legend told though thi i could scarc believ that thei had
hunt with a pack of hyena there it said also thei fought a great
fight with a band send out by dingaan the king under the command of that
faku whom umslopogaa had mention in which fight the bloodbroth
wielder of a famou club known as watcheroftheford got hi death
after do mighti deed there also as i had heard nada the lili
whose beauti wa still famou in the land di under circumst
strang as thei were sad
natur rememb my own experi or rather what seem to be
my experi for alreadi i had made up my mind that thei were but
a dream i wa most anxiou to learn whether these two who had been so
dear to thi fierc zulu had recognis him
well and what did thei sai to you umslopogaa i ask
macumazahn thei said noth at all hearken there stood thi pair
or sometim thei move to and fro my brother an even greater man
than he us to be with the wolfskin girt about him and the club
watcheroftheford which he alon could wield upon hi shoulder and
nada grown loveli even than she wa of old so love macumazahn
that my heart rose into my throat when i saw her and stop my breath
ye macumazahn there thei stood or walk about arm in arm as lover
might and look into each other ey and talk of how thei had
known each other on the earth for i could understand their word or
thought and how it wa good to be at rest togeth where thei were
you see thei were old friend umslopogaa i said
ye macumazahn veri old friend as i thought so much so that thei
had never had a word to sai of me who also wa the old friend of both
of them ay my brother whose name i am sworn not to speak the
womanhat who vow he love noth save me and the wolv could
smile into the face of nada the lili nada the bride of my youth yet
never a word of me while she could smile back and tell him how great a
warrior he had been and never a word of me whose deed she wa wont to
prais who save her in the halakazi cave and from dingaan no never
a word of me although i stood there stare at them
i suppos that thei did not see you umslopogaa
that is so macumazahn i am sure that thei did not see me for if thei
had thei would not have been so much at eas but i saw them and as thei
would not take heed when i shout i ran up call to my brother to
defend himself with hi club then as he still took no note i lift
the ax inkosikaa make it circl in the light and smote with all
my strength
and what happen umslopogaa
onli thi macumazahn that the ax went straight through my brother
from the crown of hi head to the groin cut him in two and he just
went on talk inde he did more for stoop down he gather a
white lilybloom which grew there and gave it to nada who smelt at
it smile and thank him and then thrust it into her girdl still
thank him all the while ye she did thi for i saw it with my ey
macumazahn
here the zulu voic broke and i think that he wept for in the faint
light i saw him draw hi long hand across hi ey whereon i took the
opportun to turn my back and light a pipe
macumazahn he went on present it seem that mad took hold
of me for a long while for i shout and rave at them think that
word and rage might hurt where good steel could not and as i did
so thei fade awai and disappear still smile and talk nada
smell at the lili which have a long stalk rose up abov her
breast after thi i rush awai and suddenli met that savag king
rezu whom i slew a few dai gone at him i went with the ax wonder
whether he would put up a better fight thi second time
and did he umslopogaa
nai but i think he felt me for he turn and fled and when i tri to
follow i could not see him so i ran on and present who should i find
but baleka baleka chaka sister whorepeat it not macumazahnwa
my mother and macumazahn she saw me ye though i wa but littl
when last she look on me who now am great and grim she saw and knew
me for she float up to me and smile at me and seem to press her
lip upon my forehead though i could feel no kiss and to draw the
sore out of my heart then she too wa gone and of a sudden i fell
down through space have i suppos step into some deep hole or
perchanc a well
the next thing i knew wa that i awok in the hous of the white witch
and saw you sleep at my side and the witch lean back upon her bed
and smile at me through the thin blanket with which she cover herself
up for i could see the laughter in her ey
now i grew mad with her becaus of the thing that i had seen in the
place of dream and it came into my heart that it would be well to kill
her that the world might be rid of her and her evil magic which can show
li to men so be distraught i sprang up and lift the ax and
step toward her whereon she rose and stood befor me laugh out
loud then she said someth in the tongu i cannot understand and
point with her finger and lo next moment it wa as if giant had
seiz me and were whirl me awai till present i found myself
breathless but unharm beyond the arch andwhat doe it all mean
macumazahn
veri littl as i think umslopogaa except that thi queen ha power
to which those of zikali ar as noth and can caus vision to float
befor the ey of men for know that such thing as you saw i saw and
in them those whom i have love also seem to take no thought of me
but onli to be concern with each other moreov when i awok and told
thi to the queen who is call shewhocommand she laugh at me as
she did at you and said that it wa a good lesson for my pride who in
that pride had believ that the dead onli thought of the live but
i think that the lesson came from her who wish to humbl us
umslopogaa and that it wa her mind that shape these vision which we
saw
i think so too macumazahn but how she knew of all the matter of your
life and mine i do not know unless perchanc zikali told them to her
speak in the nightwatch as wizard can
nai umslopogaa i believ that by her magic she drew our stori out
of our own heart and then set them forth to us afresh put her own
colour on them also it mai be that she drew someth from han and
from goroko and the other zulu with you and thu paid us the fee that
she had promis for our servic but in lungsick oxen and barren cow
not in good cattl umslopogaa
he nod and said
though at the time i seem to go mad and though i know that women ar
fals and men must follow where thei lead them never will i believ
that my brother the womanhat and nada ar lover in the land below
and have there forgotten me the comrad of on of them and the husband
of the other moreov i hold macumazahn that you and i have met with
a just reward for our folli
we have sought to look through the bottom of the grave at thing which
the greatgreat in heaven abov did not mean that men should see and
now that we have seen we ar unhappi than we were sinc such dream
burn themselv upon the heart as a redhot iron burn the hide of an
ox so that the hair will never grow again where it ha been and the
hide is mar
to you watcherbynight i sai content yourself with your watch
and whatev it mai bring to you in fame and wealth and to myself i
sai holder of the ax content yourself with the ax and what it mai
bring to you in fair fight and glori and to both of us i sai let
the dead sleep unawaken until we go to join them which sure will be
soon enough
good word umslopogaa but thei should have been spoken er ever we
set out on thi journei
not so macumazahn sinc that journei we were fate to make to save
on who li yonder the ladi sadey and as thei tell me is
well again also zikali will it and who can resist the will of the
openerofroad so it is made and we have seen mani strang thing
and won some glori and come to know how deep is the pool of our own
foolish who thought that we could search out the secret of death
and there have onli found those of a witch mind and venom reflect
as in water and now have discov all these thing i wish to be
gone from thi haunt land when do we march macumazahn
tomorrow morn i believ if the ladi sadey and the other ar
well enough as shewhocommand sai thei will be
good then i would sleep who am more weari than i wa after i had
kill rezu in the battl on the mountain
ye i answer sinc it is harder to fight ghost than men and
dream if thei be bad ar more dread than deed goodnight
umslopogaa
he went and i too went to see how it fare with inez i found that she
wa fast asleep but in a quit differ sleep to that into which ayesha
seem to have plung her now it wa absolut natur and look
at her ly there upon the bed i thought how young and healthi wa
her appear the women in charg of her also told me that she had
awaken at the hour appoint by shewhocommand as it seem
quit well and veri hungri although she appear to be puzzl by
her surround after she had eaten thei ad that she had sung
a song which wa probabl a hymn and prai upon her knee make
sign upon her breast and then gone quietli to bed
my anxieti reliev as regard inez i return to my own quarter not
feel inclin for slumber howev instead of turn in i sat at
the doorwai contempl the beauti of the night while i watch the
countless firefli that seem to dust the air with spark of burn
gold also the great owl and other fowl that haunt the dark these had
come out in number from their hidingplac among the ruin and sail
to and fro like whitewing spirit now seen and now lost in the
gloom
while i sat thu mani reflect came to me as to the extraordinari
natur of my experi dure the past few dai had ani man ever
known the like i wonder what could thei mean and what could thi
marvel woman ayesha be wa she perhap a personif of natur
itself as inde to some extent all women ar wa she human at all
or wa she some spirit symbolis a depart peopl faith and
civilis and haunt the ruin where onc she reign as queen
no the idea wa ridicul sinc such be do not exist though it
wa imposs to doubt that she possess power beyond those of common
human as she possess beauti and fascin greater than ar given
to ani other woman
of on thing i wa certain howev that the shade i had seem
to visit had their be in the circl of her own imagin and
intellig there umslopogaa wa right we had seen no dead we had
onli seen pictur and imag that she drew and fashion
why did she do thi i wonder perhap to pretend to power which she
did not possess perhap out of sheer elfish mischief or perhap as
she assert just to teach us a lesson and to humbl us in our own
sight well if so she had succeed for never did i feel so crush
and humili as at that moment
i had seem to descend or ascend into hade and there had onli seen
thing that gave me littl joi and did but serv to reopen old wound
then on awak i had been bewitch ye fresh from those vision
of the most dear dead i had been bewitch by the overpow magic of
thi woman loveli and charm and made a fool of myself onli to be
brought back to my sens by her triumphant mockeri oh i wa humbl
inde and yet the odd thing is that i could not feel angri with her
and what is more that perhap from vaniti i believ in her profess
of friendship toward myself
well the upshot of it wa that like umslopogaa more than anyth
els in the world did i desir to depart from thi haunt kr and to
buri all it recollect in such activ as fortun might bring to
me and yet and yet it wa well to have seen it and to have pluck the
flower of such marvel experi nor as i knew even then could i
ever inter the memori of ayesha the wise the perfect in all loveli
and the halfdivin in power
when i awok the next morn the sun wa well up and after i had taken
a swim in the old bath and dress myself i went to see how it
fare with inez i found her sit at the door of her hous look
extrem well and with a radiant face she wa engag in make a
chain of some small and beauti blue flower of the iri tribe of
which quantiti grew about that she thread togeth upon stalk of
dry grass
thi chain which wa just finish she threw over her head so that
it hung down upon her white robe for now she wa dress like an arab
woman though without the veil i watch her unseen for a littl while
then came forward and spoke to her she start at the sight of me and
rose as though to run awai then appar reassur by my appear
select a particularli fine flower and offer it to me
i saw at onc that she did not know me in the least and thought that she
had never seen me befor in short that her mind had gone exactli as
ayesha had said that it would do by wai of make convers i ask
her if she felt well she repli oh ye she had never felt better
then ad
daddi ha gone on a long journei and will not be back for week and
week
an idea came to me and i answer
ye inez but i am a friend of hi and he ha sent me to take you to
a place where i hope that we shall find him onli it is far awai so you
also must make a long journei
she clap her hand and answer
oh that will be nice i do so love travel especi to find
daddi who i expect will have my proper cloth with him not these
which although thei ar veri comfort and pretti seem differ to
what i us to wear you look veri nice too and i am sure that we shall
be great friend which i am glad of for i have been rather lone
sinc my mother went to live with the saint in heaven becaus you
see daddi is so busi and so often awai that i do not see much of him
upon my word i could have wept when i heard her prattl on thu it is
so terribl unnatur almost dread inde to listen to a full grown
woman who talk in the accent and express the thought of a child
howev under all the circumst i recognis that her calam wa
merci and rememb that ayesha had prophesi the recoveri of her
mind as well as it loss and how great seem to be her power in these
direct i took such comfort as i could
leav her i went to see the two zulu who had been wound and found
to my joi that thei were now quit well and fit to travel for here
too ayesha propheci had prove good the other men also were
complet rest and anxiou to be gone like umslopogaa and myself
while i wa eat my breakfast han announc the vener billali
who with a sweep bow inform me that he had come to inquir when we
should be readi to start as he had receiv order to see to all the
necessari arrang i repliedwithin an hour and he depart in a
hurri
but littl after the appoint time he reappear with a number of
litter and their bearer also with a bodyguard of twentyf pick
men all of whom we recognis as brave fellow who had fought well in
the battl these men and the bearer old billali harangu tell
them that thei were to guid carri and escort us to the other side of
the great swamp or further if we need it and that it wa the word of
shewhocommand that if so much as the smallest harm came to ani on
of us even by accid thei should die everi man of them by the
hotpot whatev that might be for i wa not sure of the signific
of thi horror then he ask them if thei understood thei repli
with fervour that thei understood perfectli and would lead and guard us
as though we were their own mother
for thi see the book call sheeditor
as a matter of fact thei did and i think would have done so
independ of ayesha command sinc thei look upon umslopogaa
and myself almost as god and thought that we could destroi them all if
we wish as we had destroi rezu and hi host
i ask billali if he were not come with us to which he repli no
as shewhocommand had return to her own place and he must follow
her at onc i ask him again where her own place might be to which
he answer vagu that it wa everywher and he stare first at the
heaven and then at the earth as though she inhabit most of them
ad that gener it wa in the cave though what he meant by
that i did not know then he said that he wa veri glad to have met us
and that the sight of umslopogaa kill rezu wa a spectacl that
he would rememb with pleasur all hi life also he ask me for a
present i gave him a spare pencil that i possess in a littl german
silver case with which he wa delight thu i part with old
billali of whom i shall alwai think with a certain affect
i notic even then that he kept veri clear inde of umslopogaa
think i suppos that he might take a last opportun to fulfil hi
threat and introduc him to hi terribl ax

umslopogaa wear the great medicin
a littl while later we start some of us in litter includ the
wound zulu who i insist should be carri for a dai or two and
some on foot inez i caus to be born immedi in front of myself
so that i could keep an ey upon her moreov i put her in the especi
charg of han to whom fortun she took a great fanci at onc
perhap becaus she rememb subconsci that she knew him and that
he had been kind to her although when thei met after her long sleep as
in my own case she did not recognis him in the least
soon howev thei were again the fastest of friend so much so that
within a dai or two the littl hottentot practic fill the place of
a maid to her attend to her everi want and look after her
exactli as a nurs doe after a child with the result that it wa quit
touch to see how she came to depend upon him her monkei as she
call him and how fond he grew of her
onc inde there wa troubl sinc hear a nois i came up to
find han bristl with furi and threaten to shoot on of the zulu
who stupidli or perhap rude had knock against the litter of inez
and nearli turn it over for the rest the ladi sadey as thei
call her had for the time becam the ladi gladey sinc she wa
merri as the dai wa long laugh and sing and plai just as a
healthi happi child should do
onli onc did i see her wretch and weep it wa when a kitten which
she had insist on bring with her sprang out of the litter and
vanish into some bush where it could not be found even when she
wa soon consol and dri her tear when han explain to her in a
mixtur of bad english and wors portugues that it had onli run awai
becaus it wish to get back to it mother which it love and that it
wa cruel to separ it from it mother
we made good progress and by the even of the first dai were over the
crest of the cliff or volcano lip that encircl the great plain of kr
and descend rapidli to a shelter spot on the outer slope where our
camp wa to be set for the night
not veri far from thi place as i think i have mention stood and i
suppos still stand a veri curiou pinnacl of rock which doubtless
be of some harder sort had remain when hundr of thousand or
million of year befor the surround lava had been wash or had
corrod awai thi rock pillar wa perhap fifti feet high and as
smooth as though it had been work by man inde i rememb have
remark to han or umslopogaasi forget whichwhen we pass it on
our inward journei that there wa a column which no monkei could climb
as we went by it for the second time the sun had alreadi disappear
behind the western cliff but a fierc rai from it sink orb struck
upon a stormcloud that hung over us and thenc wa reflect in a
glow of angri light of which the focu or centr seem to fall upon the
summit of thi strang and obelisklik pinnacl of rock
at the moment i wa out of my litter and walk with umslopogaa at
the end of the line to make sure that no on straggl in the oncom
dark when we had pass the column by some forti or fifti yard
someth caus umslopogaa to turn and look back he utter an
exclam which made me follow hi exampl with the result that i saw
a veri wonder thing for there on the point of the pillar like st
simeon stylit on hi famou column glow in the sunset rai as
though she were on fire stood ayesha herself
it wa a strang and in a wai a gloriou sight for pois thu between
earth and heaven she look like some glow angel rather than
a woman stand as she seem to do upon the dark sinc the
shadow save for the faintest outlin had swallow up the column that
support her moreov in the intens rich light that wa focuss
on her we could see everi detail of her form and face for she wa
unveil and even her larg and tender ey which gaze upward emptili
at thi moment thei seem veri tender ye and the littl gold stud
that glitter on her sandal and the shine of the snake girdl she wore
about her waist
we stare and stare till i said inconsequ
learn umslopogaa what a liar is that old billali who told me that
shewhocommand had depart from kr to her own place
perhap thi rock edg is her own place if she be there at all
macumazahn
if she be there i answer angrili for my nerv were at onc
thrill and torn speak not empti word umslopogaa for where els
can she be when we see her with our ey
who am i that i should know the wai of witch who like the wind
ar abl to go and come as thei will can a woman run up a wall of rock
like a lizard macumazahn
doubtless and i began some explan which i have forgotten
when a pass cloud or i know not what cut off the light so that both
the pinnacl and she who stood on it becam invis a minut later
it return for a littl while and there wa the point of the
needleshap rock but it wa empti as save for the bird that rest
on it it had been sinc the begin of the world
then umslopogaa and i shook our head and pursu our wai in silenc
thi wa the last that i saw of the gloriou ayesha if inde i did see
her and not her ghost yet it is true that for all the first part of the
journei till we were through the great swamp in fact from time to
time i wa consciou or imagin that i wa consciou of her presenc
moreov onc other saw her or someon who might have been her it
happen thu
we were in the centr of the great swamp and the train guid who were
lead came to a place where the path fork and were uncertain
which road to take final thei fix on the righthand path and were
prepar to follow it togeth with those who bore the litter of inez
by the side of which han wa walk as usual
at thi moment as han told me the guid went down upon their face
and he saw stand in front of them a whiteveil form who point to
the lefthand path and then seem to be lost in the mist without a
word the guid rose and follow thi lefthand path han stop the
litter till i came up when he told me what had happen while inez also
began to chatter in her childish fashion about a white ladi
i had the curios to walk a littl wai along the righthand path which
thei were about to take onli a few yard further on i found myself
sink in a float quagmir from which i extric myself with much
difficulti but just in time for as i discov afterward by probe
with a pole the water beneath the mat reed wa deep that night
i question the guid upon the subject but without result for thei
pretend to have seen noth and not to understand what i meant of
neither of these incid have i ani explan to offer except
that onc contract it is as difficult to be rid of the habit of
hallucin as of ani other
it is not necessari that i should give all the detail of our long
homeward journei so i will onli sai that have dismiss our bearer
and escort when we reach higher ground beyond the horribl swamp
keep on litter for inez in which the zulu carri her when she
wa tire we accomplish it in complet safeti and have cross the
zambesi at last on even reach the hous call strathmuir
here we found the waggon and oxen quit safe and were welcom
raptur by my zulu driver and the voorloop who had made up
their mind that we were dead and were think of trek homeward
here also thomaso greet us though i think that like the zulu he
wa astonish at our safe return and inde not overpleas to see us
i told him that captain robertson had been kill in a fight in which
we had rescu hi daughter from the cannib who had carri her off
inform which i caution him to keep to himself but noth els
that i could help
also i warn the zulu through umslopogaa and goroko that no mention
wa to be made of our adventur either then or afterward sinc if
thi were done the curs of the white queen would fall on them and bring
them to disast and death i ad that the name of thi queen and
everyth that wa connect with her or her do must be lock up
in their own heart it must be like the name of dead king not to
be spoken nor inde did thei ever speak it or tell the stori of our
search becaus thei were too much afraid both of ayesha whom thei
believ to be the greatest of all witch and of the ax of their
captain umslopogaa
inez went to bed that night without seem to recognis her old home
to all appear just a mindless child as she had been ever sinc she
awok from her tranc at kr next morn howev han came to tell
me that she wa chang and that she wish to speak with me i went
wonder to find her in the sittingroom dress in european cloth
which she had taken from where she kept them and onc more a reason
woman
mr quatermain she said i suppos that i must have been ill for
the last thing i rememb is go to sleep on the night after you
start for the hippopotamu hunt where is my father did ani harm come
to him while he wa hunt
ala i answer ly boldli for i fear lest the truth
should take awai her mind again it did he wa trampl upon by a
hippopotamu bull which charg him and kill and we were oblig to
buri him where he di
she bow her head for a while and mutter some prayer for hi soul
then look at me keenli and said
i do not think you ar tell me everyth mr quatermain but
someth seem to sai that thi is becaus it is not well that i should
learn everyth
no i answer you have been ill and out of your mind for quit a
long while someth gave you a shock i think that you learn of your
father death which you have now forgotten and were overcom with the
new pleas trust to me and believ that if i keep anyth back from
you it is becaus i think it best to do so for the present
i trust and i believ she answer now pleas leav me but tell me
first where ar those women and their children
after your father di thei went awai i repli ly onc more
she look at me again but made no comment
then i left her
how much inez ever learn of the true stori of her adventur i do not
know to thi hour though my opinion is that it wa but littl to
begin with everyon includ thomaso wa threaten with the direst
consequ if he said a word to her on the subject moreov in her
wai she wa a wise woman on who knew when it wa best not to ask
question she wa awar that she had suffer from a fit of aberr
or mad and that dure thi time her father had di and certain
peculiar thing had happen there she wa content to leav the
busi and she never again spoke to me upon the subject of thi i wa
veri glad as how on earth could i have explain to her about ayesha
propheci as to her laps into childish and subsequ return to a
normal state when she reach her home see that i did not understand
them myself
onc inde she did inquir what had becom of jane to which i answer
that she had di dure her sick it wa anoth lie at ani rate
by implic but i hold that there ar occas when it is righteou
to lie at least these particular falsehood have never troubl my
conscienc
here i mai as well finish the stori of inez that is as far as i can
as i have shown she wa alwai a woman of melancholi and religi
tempera qualiti that seem to grow upon her after her return to
health certainli the religion did for continu she wa engag in
prayer a develop with which hered mai have had someth to do
sinc after he becam a reform charact and grew unsettl in hi
mind her father follow the same road
on our return to civilis as it chanc on of the first person
with whom she came in contact wa a veri earnest and excel old
priest of her own faith the end of thi intimaci wa much what might
have been expect veri soon inez determin to renounc the world
which i think never had ani great attract for her and enter a
sisterhood of an extrem strict order in natal where ad to her
mani merit her consider possess made her veri welcom inde
onc in after year i saw her again when she expect befor long to
becom the mothersuperior of her convent i found her veri cheer and
she told me that her happi wa complet even then she did not ask
me the true stori of what had happen to her dure that period when
her mind wa a blank she said that she knew someth had happen but
that as she no longer felt ani curios about earthli thing she did
not wish to know the detail again i rejoic for how could i tell
the true tale and expect to be believ even by the most confid and
simplemind nun
to return to more immedi event when we had been at strathmuir for
a dai or two and i thought that her mind wa clear enough to judg of
affair i told inez that i must journei on to natal and ask her what
she wish to do without a moment hesit she repli that she
desir to come with me as now that her father wa dead noth would
induc her to continu to live at strathmuir without friend or inde
the consol of religion
then she show me a secret hidingplac cunningli devis in a sort of
cellar under the sittingroom floor where her father wa accustom to
keep the spirit of which he consum so great a quantiti in thi hole
beneath some brick we discov a larg sum in gold store awai
which robertson had alwai told hi daughter she would find there in
the event of anyth happen to him with the monei were hi will
and secur also certain memento of hi youth and some lovelett
togeth with a prayerbook that hi mother had given him
these valuabl of which no on knew the exist except herself we
remov and then made our prepar for departur thei were simpl
such articl of valu as we could carri were pack into the waggon and
the best of the cattl we drove with us the place with the store and
the rest of the stock were hand over to thomaso on a halfprofit
agreement under arrang that he should remit the share of inez twice
a year to a bank on the coast where her father had an account whether
or not he ever did thi i am unabl to sai but as no on wish to stop
at strathmuir i could conceiv no better plan becaus purchas of
properti in that district did not exist
as we trek awai on fine morn i ask inez whether she wa sorri
to leav the place
no she repli with energi my life there ha been a hell and i
never wish to see it again
now it wa after thi on the northern border of zululand that
zikali great medicin as han call it realli plai it chief
part for without it i think that we should have been kill everi on
of us i do not propos to set out the busi in detail it is too
long and intric suffic it to sai therefor that it had to do with
the plot of umslopogaa against cetywayo which had been betrai by
hi wife monazi and her lover lousta both of whom i have mention
earlier in thi record the result wa that a watch for him wa kept on
all the frontier becaus it wa guess that sooner or later he would
return to zululand also it had becom known that he wa travel in
my compani
so it came about that when my approach wa report by spi a compani
wa gather under the command of a man connect with the royal hous
and by it we were surround befor attack howev thi captain
sent men to me with the messag that with me the king had no quarrel
although i wa travel in doubt compani and that if i would
deliv over to him umslopogaa chief of the peopl of the ax and hi
follow i might go whither i wish unharm take my good with
me otherwis we should be attack at onc and kill everi on of
us sinc it wa not desir that ani wit should be left of what
happen to umslopogaa have deliv thi ultimatum and declin
ani argument as to it term the messeng retir sai that thei
would return for my answer within half an hour
when thei were out of hear umslopogaa who had listen to their
word in grim silenc turn and spoke in such fashion as might have
been expect of him
macumazahn he said now i come to the end of an unlucki journei
though mayhap it is not so evil as it seem sinc i who went out to
seek the dead but to be fill by yonder white witch with the meat of
mock shadow am about to find the dead in the onli wai in which thei
can be found name by becom of their number
it seem that thi is the case with all of us umslopogaa
not so macumazahn that child of the king will give you safeconduct
it is i and mine whose blood he seek as he ha the right to do sinc
it is true that i would have rais rebellion against the king i who
weari of my petti lot and knew that by blood hi place wa mine in
thi quarrel you have no share though you whose heart is as white as
your skin ar not mind to desert me moreov even if you wish
to fight there is on in the waggon yonder whose life is not your to
give the ladi sadey is as a child in your arm and her you must bear
to safeti
now thi argument wa so unanswer that i did not know what to sai
so i onli ask what he meant to do as escap wa imposs see
that we were surround on everi side
make a gloriou end macumazahn he said with a smile i will go out
with those who cling to me that is with all who remain of my men sinc
my fate must be their and stand back to back on yonder mound and there
wait till these dog of the king come up against us watch a while
macumazahn and see how umslopogaa bearer of the ax and the warrior
of the ax can fight and die
now i wa silent for i knew not what to sai there we all stood silent
while minut by minut i watch the shadow creep forward toward a
mark that the head messeng had made with hi spear upon the ground
for he had said that when it touch that mark he would return for hi
answer
in thi rather dread silenc i heard a dry littl cough which i knew
came from the throat of han and to be hi method of indic that he
had a remark to make
what is it i ask with irrit for it wa annoi to see him
seat there on the ground fan himself with the remain of a hat and
stare vacantli at the sky
noth baa or rather onli thi baa those hyena of zulu ar
even more afraid of the great medicin than were the cannib up north
sinc the maker of it is nearer to them baa you rememb baa thei
knelt to it as it were when we were go out of zululand
well what of it now that we ar go into zululand i inquir
sharpli do you want me to show it to them
no baa what is the us see that thei ar readi to let you
pass also the ladi sadey and me and the cattl with the driver and
voorloop which is better still and all the other good so what
have you to gain by show them the medicin but perchanc if it were
on the neck of umslopogaa and he show it to them and brought it to
their mind that those who touch him who is in the shadow of zikali
great medicin or aught that is hi die within three moon in thi
wai or in thatwel baa who know and again he cough drili and
stare up at the sky
i translat what han had said in dutch to umslopogaa who remark
indiffer
thi littl yellow man is well name lightindark at least the
plan can be triedif it fail there is alwai time to die
so think that thi wa an occas on which i might properli do so
for the first time i took off the talisman which i had worn for so long
and umslopogaa put it over hi head and hid it beneath hi blanket
a littl while later the messeng return and thi time the captain
himself came with them as he said to greet me for i knew him slightli
and onc we had dealt togeth about some cattl after a friendli chat
he turn to the matter of umslopogaa explain the case at some
length i said that i quit understood hi posit but that it wa a
veri awkward thing to interfer with a man who wa the actual wearer
of the great medicin of zikali itself when the captain heard thi hi
ey almost start out of hi head
the great medicin of the openerofroad he exclaim oh now
i understand why thi chief of the peopl of the ax is
unconquerablesuch a wizard that no on is abl to kill him
ye i repli and you rememb do you not that he who offend the
great medicin or offer violenc to him who wear it di horribl
within three moon he and hi household and all those with him
i have heard it he said with a sickli smile
and now you ar about to learn whether the tale is true i ad
cheerfulli
then he ask to see umslopogaa alon
i did not overhear their convers but the end of it wa that
umslopogaa came and said in a loud voic so that no on could miss a
singl word that as resist wa useless and he did not wish me
hi friend to be involv in ani troubl togeth with hi men he had
agre to accompani thi king captain to the royal kraal where he had
been guarante a fair trial as to certain fals charg which had been
brought against him he ad that the king captain had sworn upon
the great medicin of the openerofroad to give him safe conduct and
attempt no mischief against him which as wa well known throughout
the land wa an oath that could not be broken by anyon who wish to
continu to look upon the sun
i ask the captain if these thing were so also speak in a loud
voic he repli ye sinc hi order were to take umslopogaa aliv
if he might he wa onli to kill him if he would not come
afterward while pretend to give him certain articl out of the
waggon i had a few privat word with umslopogaa who told me that the
arrang wa that he should be allow to escap at night with hi
peopl
be sure of thi macumazahn he said that if i do not escap
neither will that captain sinc i walk at hi side and keep my ax
and at the first sign of treacheri the ax will enter the hous of that
thick head of hi and make friend with the brain insid
macumazahn he ad we have made a strang journei togeth and
seen such thing as i did not think the world had to show also i have
fought and kill rezu in a mad battl of ghost and men which alon
wa worth all the troubl of the journei now it ha come to an end as
everyth must and we part but as i believ not for alwai i do
not think that i shall die on thi journei with the captain though i do
think that other will die at the end of it he ad grimli a sai
which at the time i did not understand
it come into my heart macumazahn that in yonder land of witch and
wizard the spirit of propheci got caught in my moocha and crept into
my bowel now that spirit tell me that we shall meet again in the
afteryear and stand togeth in a great frai which will be our last
as i believ that the white witch said or perhap the spirit live in
zikali medicin which ha gone down my throat and come out of it in
word i cannot sai but i prai that it is a true spirit sinc although
you ar white and i am black and you ar small and i am big and you ar
gentl and cun wherea i am fierc and as open as the blade of my
own ax yet i love you as well macumazahn as though we were born
of the same mother and had been brought up in the same kraal now that
captain wait and grow doubt of our talk so farewel i will return
the great medicin to zikali if i live and if i die he must send on
of the ghost that serv him to fetch it from among my bone
farewel to you also yellow man he went on to han who had
appear hover about like a dog that is doubt of it welcom
well ar you name lightindark and glad am i to have met you
who have learn from you how a snake move and strike and how a
jackal think and avoid the snare ye farewel for the spirit within
me doe not tell me that you and i shall meet again
then he lift the great ax and gave me a formal salut name me
chief and father great chief and father from of old baba koo y
umcool koo y pagat therebi acknowledg my superior over him
a thing that he had never done befor and as he did so did goroko
and the other zulu ad to their salut mani titl of prais in
anoth minut he had gone with the king captain to whose side i
note he clung lovingli hi long thin finger plai about the horn
handl of the ax that wa name inkosikaa and groanmak
i am glad we have seen the last of him and hi ax baa remark
han spit reflect it is veri well to sleep in the same hut
with a tame lion sometim but after you have done so for mani moon
you begin to wonder when you will wake up at night to find him pull
the blanket off you and comb your hair with hi claw ye i am
veri glad that thi halftam lion is gone sinc sometim i have
thought that i should be oblig to poison it that we might sleep in
peac you know he call me a snake baa and poison is a snake
onli spear shall i tell the boi to inspan the oxen baa i think
the further we get from that king captain and hi men the more
comfort shall we travel especi now when we no longer have the
great medicin to protect us
you suggest give it to him han i said
ye baa i had rather that umslopogaa went awai with the great
medicin than that you kept the great medicin and he stop with us
here never travel with a traitor baa at ani rate in the land of the
king whom he wish to kill king ar veri selfish peopl baa and do
not like be kill especi by someon who want to sit upon their
stool and to take the royal salut no on give the royal salut to a
dead king baa howev great he wa befor he di and no on think
the wors of a king who wa a traitor befor he becam a king
chapter xxv
allan deliv the messag
onc more i sat in the black kloof face to face with old zikali
so you have got back safe macumazahn he said well i told you
you would did i not as for what happen to you upon the journei let
it be for now that i am old long stori tire me and i daresai that
there is noth wonder about thi on where is the charm i lent
you give it back now that it ha serv it turn
i have not got it zikali i pass it on to umslopogaa of the ax to
save hi life from the king men
oh ye so you did i had forgotten here it is and open hi robe
of fur he show me the hideou littl talisman hang about hi
neck then ad would you like a copi of it macumazahn to keep as a
memori if so i will carv on for you
no i answer i should not ha umslopogaa been here
ye he ha been and gone again which is on of the reason why i do
not wish to hear your tale a second time
where to the town of the peopl of the ax
no macumazahn he came thenc or so i understood but thither he will
return no more
why not zikali
becaus after hi fashion he made troubl there and left some dead
behind him on lousta i believ whom he had appoint to sit on hi
stool as chief while he wa awai and a woman call monazi who wa hi
wife or lousta wife or the wife of both of them i forget which it
is said that have heard stori of herand the ear of jealousi ar
long macumazahnh cut off thi woman head with a sweep of the ax
and made lousta fight him till he fell which the fool did almost befor
he had lift hi shield it serv him right who should have made sure
that umslopogaa wa dead befor he wrap himself in hi blanket and
took the woman to cook hi porridg
where ha the axebear gone i ask without surpris for thi new
did not astonish me
i neither know nor care macumazahn to becom a wander i suppos
he will tell you the tale when you meet again in the afterdai as i
understand he think that you will do hearken i have done with thi
lion whelp who is chaka over again but without chaka wit ye he
is just a fight man with a long reach a sure ey and the trick of
handl an ax and such ar of littl us to me who know too mani of
them thrice have i tri to make him till my garden but each time
he ha broken the hoe although the wage i promis him wa a royal
kaross and noth less so enough of umslopogaa the woodpeck
almost i wish that you had not lent him the charm for then the king
men would have made an end of him who know too much and like some
silli boaster mai shout out the truth when hi ax is aloft and he is
full of the beer of battl for in battl he will live and in battl he
will die macumazahn as perhap you mai see on dai
for the tale of thi meet see the book call allan
quatermaineditor
the fate of your friend doe not troubl you over much
openerofroad i said with sarcasm
not at all macumazahn becaus i have none the onli friend of the
old ar those whom thei can turn to their own end and if these fail
them thei find other
i understand zikali and know now what to expect from you
he laugh in hi strang wai and answer
ay and it is good that you must expect good in the futur as in the
past for you macumazahn who ar brave in your own fashion without
be a fool like umslopogaa and although you know it not like some
mastersmith forg my assegai out of the red or i give you temper
them in the blood of men and yet keep your mind innoc and your hand
clean friend like you ar us to such as i macumazahn and must be
well paid in those ware that pleas them
the old wizard brood for a space while i reflect upon hi amaz
cynic which interest me in a wai for the extrem of unmor is
as fascin to studi as the extrem of virtu and often more so then
jerk up hi great head he ask suddenli
what messag had the white queen for me
she said that you troubl her too much at night in dream zikali
ay but if i ceas to do so ever she desir to know the reason why
for i hear her ask me in the voic of the wind or in the twitter
of bat after all she is a woman macumazahn and it must be dull
sit alon from year to year with naught to stai her appetit save
the ash of the past and dream of the futur so dull that i wonder
have onc mesh you in her web how she found the heart to let you
go befor she had suck out your life and spirit i suppos that have
made a mock of you and drain you dry she wa content to throw you
asid like an empti gourd perchanc had she kept you at her side
you would have been a stone in her path in dai to come perchanc
macumazahn she wait for other travel and would welcom them or
on of them alon sai noth of a certain watcherbynight who ha
serv her turn and vanish into the night
but what other messag had the white queen for the poor old savag
witchdoctor whose talk weari her so much in her haunt sleep
then i told him of the pictur that ayesha had shown me in the water
the pictur of a king dy in a hut and of two who watch hi end
zikali listen intent to everi word then broke into a peal of hi
unholi laughter
ohoho he laugh so all goe well though the road be long
sinc whatev thi white on mai have shown you in the fire of the
heaven abov she could show you noth but truth in the water of
the earth below for that is the law of our compani of seer you have
work well for me macumazahn and you have had your fee the fee of
the vision of the dead which you desir abov all mortal thing
ay i answer indignantli a fee of bitter fruit whereof the juic
burn and twist the mouth and the stone still stick fast within the
gizzard i tell you zikali that she stuf my heart with li
i daresai macumazahn i daresai but thei were veri pretti li were
thei not and after all i am sure that there wa wisdom in them as you
will discov when you have thought them over for a score of year
li li all is li but beyond the lie stand truth as the white
witch stand behind her veil you drew the veil macumazahn and saw
that beneath which brought you to your knee why it is a parabl
