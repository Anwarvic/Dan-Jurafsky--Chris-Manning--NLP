the author desir to thank mr dr daniel for the kind and valuabl
assist he ha given him in hi research into the social work of
the salvat armi
he take thi occas to make it clear that thi book doe no more
than set out the result of hi investig into some of that vast
social work and hi person conclus as to it and those by whom
it is prosecut
to obviat ani possibl misunderstand as to the reason of it
write he wish to state further that it ha not been compil by
him as a matter of literari busi
introductori
what is the salvat armi
if thi question were put to the ordinari person of fashion or
leisur how would it be answer
in mani case thu the salvat armi is a bodi of peopl dress up
in a semimilitari uniform or those of them who ar women in
unbecom poke bonnet who go about the street make a nois in
the name of god and frighten hors with brass band it is under
the rule of an arbitrari old gentleman name booth who call himself
a gener and whose princip trade asset consist in a handsom and
unusu face and an inexhaust flow of languag which he
gener deliv from a white motorcar wherev he find that he
can attract the most attent he is a clever actor in hi wai who
ha got a great number of peopl under hi thumb and i am told that
he ha made a larg fortun out of the busi like the late prophet
dowi and other of the same sort the newspap ar alwai expos
him but he know which side hi bread is butter and doe not care
when he is gone no doubt hi famili will divid up the cash and we
shall hear no more of the salvat armi
such ar still the honest belief of thousand of our instruct
fellowcountrymen and of hundr of thousand of other of less
degre belong to the class which ar gener typifi under the
synonym of the man in the street by which most peopl understand
on who know littl and of that littl noth accur but who
decid the fate of polit elect
let us suppos howev that the question should succe in
interest an intellig and fairmind individu holder of these
view suffici to induc him to make inquiri into the fact
concern thi salvat armi what would he then discov
he would discov that about five and forti year ago some impuls
wherev it mai have come from move a dissent minist gift
with a mind of power and origin and a bodi of great strength and
endur gift also with an abl wife who share hi view to
try if not to cure at least to amelior the lot of the fallen or
distress million that ar on of the natur product of high
civil by minist to their creatur want and regener
their spirit upon the plain and simpl line laid down in the new
testament he would find also that thi humbl effort at first
quit unaid ha been so success that the result seem to partak
of the natur of the miracul
thu he would learn that the religi organ found by thi
man and hi wife is now establish and in most instanc firmli
root in 56 countri and coloni where it preach the gospel in
33 separ languag that it ha over 16000 offic wholli
emploi in it servic and publish 74 period in 20 tongu
with a total circul of nearli 1000000 copi per issu that it
accommod over 28000 poor peopl nightli in it institut
maintain 229 food dpt and shelter for men women and children
and 157 labour factori where destitut or characterless peopl ar
emploi that it ha 17 home for excrimin 37 home for
children 116 industri home for the rescu of women 16 land
coloni 149 slum station for the visit and assist of the
poor 60 labour bureaux for help the unemploi and 521 dai
school for children that in addit to all these it ha crimin
and gener investig depart inebri home for men and
women inquiri offic for trace lost and miss peopl matern
hospit 37 home for train offic prisonvisit staff
and so on almost ad infinitum
he would find also that it collect and dispens an enorm
revenu mostli from among the poorer class and that it system is
run with remark busi abil that gener booth often
suppos to be so opul live upon a pittanc which most countri
clergymen would refus take noth and never have taken
anyth from the fund of the armi and lastli not to weari the
reader that whatev mai be thought of it method and of the nois
made by the 23000 or so of voluntari bandsmen who belong to it it is
undoubtedli for good or evil on of the world forc of our ag
befor go further it mai perhap be well that i should explain
how it is that i come to write these page first i ought to state
that my person acquaint with the salvat armi date back a
good mani year from the time inde when i wa write rural
england in connexion with which work i had a long and interest
interview with gener booth that is alreadi publish subsequ i
wa appoint by the british govern as a commission to
investig and report upon the land coloni of the salvat armi in
the unit state in the cours of which inquiri i came into contact
with mani of it offic and learn much of it system and method
especi with refer to emigr also i have had other
opportun of keep in touch with the armi and it develop
in the spring of 1910 i wa ask on behalf of gener booth whether
i would undertak to write for public an account of the social
work of the armi in thi countri after some hesit for the lack
of time wa a formid obstacl to a veri busi man i assent to
thi request the plan agre upon be that i should visit the
variou institut or a number of them etc and record what i
actual saw neither more nor less togeth with my result
impress thi i have done and it onli remain for me to assur
the reader that the record is true and to the best of hi belief and
abil set down without fear favour or prejudic by on not
unaccustom to such task
almost at the commenc of my labour i sought an interview with
gener booth think as i told him and hi offic the salvat
armi is not mealymouth about such matter that at hi ag it would
be well to set down hi view in black and white on the whole i
found him well and vigor he complain howev of the difficulti
he wa experienc ow to the complet loss of sight in on ey
occas by an accid dure a motor journei and the possibl
depriv of the sight of the other through cataract
of the attack that have been and ar continu made upon the
salvat armi some of them extrem bitter gener booth would sai
littl he point out that he had not been in the habit of defend
himself and hi organ in public and wa quit content that the
work should speak for itself their affair and financ had been
investig by emin men who could not find a sixpenc out of
place and for the rest a balancesheet wa publish annual thi
balancesheet for the year end septemb 30 1909 i reprint in an
appendix1
with regard to the social work of the armi which in it begin wa
a pure religi bodi gener booth said that thei had been driven
into it becaus of their sympathi with suffer thei found it
imposs to look upon peopl undergo starvat or weigh down
by sorrow and miseri that came upon them through poverti without
stretch out a hand to help them on to their feet again in the same
wai thei could not studi wrongdoer and crimin and learn their
secret histori which show how close a great proport of human
sin is connect with wretch surround without try to help
and reform them to the best of their abil thu it wa that their
social oper began increas and multipli thei contempl
not onli the regener of the individu but also of hi
circumst and were continu find out new method by which
thi might be done
the armi look forward to the develop of it social work on the
line of selfhelp selfmanag and selfsupport whenev a new
develop came under consider the question arosehow is it to
be financ the work thei had in hand at present took all their
fund on of their great underli principl wa that of the
necess of selfsupport without which no busi or undertak
could stand for long the individu must cooper in hi own moral
and physic redempt at the same time thi system of their wa
in practic on of the difficulti with which thei had to contend
sinc it caus the benevol to believ that the armi did not need
financi assist hi own view wa that thei ought to receiv
support in their work from the govern as thei actual did in
some other countri especi did he desir to receiv state aid in
deal with ascertain crimin such as wa extend to them in
certain part of the world
thu onli a few week befor in holland the parliament had ask the
salvat armi to cooper in the care of discharg prison and
gave a grant of monei for their support in java the tale wa the
same there thei were prepar estat as home for leper and soon
a larg portion of the leper popul of that land would be in their
charg
gener booth told me the stori of a celebr danish doctor an
optician who becam attract to the armi and give up hi
practic and posit enter it servic with hi wife thei said
thei wish to lead a life of real sacrific and selfdeni and so
after go through a train like ani other cadet were sent out to
take charg of the medic work in java a recent report state that
thi offic had attend 16000 patient in nine month and
perform 516 oper
in australia the govern had hand over the work amongst the
reformatori boi to the armi in new zealand the govern had
request it to take over inebri and wa now pai a
contribut to that work of 10 per head a week there the armi had
purchas two island to accommod these inebri on on which
the men follow the pursuit of agricultur fish and so forth
and the other for the women in canada there wa an idea that a larg
prison should be erect of which the salvat armi would take
charg he hope that in cours of time thei would be allow greatli
to extend their work in the english prison
gener booth point out to me with refer to their social work
that it wa necessari to spend larg sum of monei in find
employ for men whom thei had rescu here on of their greatest
difficulti wa the vehement opposit of member of the labour
parti in differ countri
thi parti said for exampl that the armi ought to pai the trade
union rate of wage to ani poor fellow whom thei had pick up and set
to such labour as papersort or carpentri thu in western
australia thei had an estat of 20000 acr ly idl when he wa
there a while ago he ask the offic in charg why he did not
cultiv thi land and make it product the man repli he had no
labour whereon the gener said that he could send him plenti from
england
ye comment the offic but the moment thei begin to work here
howev ineffici or broken down thei mai be we shall have to pai
them 7s a dai
thi regul of cours make it imposs to cultiv that
estat except at a heavi loss
he himself had been denounc as the princ of sweater becaus he
took in derelict carpent at their institut in hanburi street
which i shall describ later to whom he did not pai the trade union
wage although that institut had from the first been work at a
loss in thi case he had made peac with the parliamentari committe
by promis not to make anyth there which wa us outsid the
armi establish but still the attack went on
pass from thi subject i ask gener booth if he had form ani
forecast of the futur of the salvat armi after hi own death he
repli that there were certain factor in the present posit of the
armi which seem to him to indic it futur growth and continu
speak imperson he said that the present gener had becom an
import man not by hi own choic or through the work of
ambit but by the will of provid he had acquir a certain
stand a great hold over hi commun and an influenc which
help to concentr and keep togeth forc that had grown to be
worldwid in their charact it wa natur therefor that peopl
should wonder what would happen when he ceas to be
hi answer to these queri wa that legal arrang had been made
to provid for thi obviou conting under the provis of the
constitut of the armi he had select hi successor although he
had never told anybodi the name of that successor which he felt sure
when announc wa on that would command the fullest confid and
respect the first duti of the gener of the armi on take up hi
offic wa to choos a man to succe him reserv to himself the
power to chang that man for anoth should he see good reason for
such a cours in short hi choic is secret and be unhamp by
ani law of hered or other consider except those that appeal
to hi own reason and judgment not final he nomin whom he will
i ask him what would happen if thi nomin gener misconduct
himself in ani wai or prove unsuit or lost hi reason he
repli that in such circumst arrang had been made under
which the head of the armi could elect anoth gener and that what
thei decid would be law the organ of the armi wa such that
ani depart of it remain independ of the abil of on
individu if a man prove incompet or did not succe hi
offic wa chang the squar man wa never left in the round hole
each depart had law for it direct and guidanc and those in
author were respons for the execut of those law if for ani
reason whatsoev on command fell out of the line of action
anoth wa alwai wait to take hi place in short he had no fear
that the remov of hi own person and name would affect the
organ it wa true he remark that leader cannot be
manufactur to order and also that the armi had made and would
continu to make mistak up and down the world but those mistak
show them how to avoid similar error and how and where to improv
as regard a chang of headship a fresh individu alwai ha
charm and a new forc would alwai strike out in some new direct
the man need wa on who would do someth gener booth did not
fear but that he would be alwai forthcom and said that for hi
part he wa quit happi as to the futur in which he anticip an
enlarg of their work the organ exist and with it the
arrang for fill everi nich the disciplin of todai would
continu tomorrow and that spirit would alwai be readi to burst
into flame when it wa need
in hi view it wa inextinguish

no monei as their labour is worth littl in the second week 6d is
paid to them in cash and subsequ thi remuner is ad to
in proport to the valu of the labour till in the end some of them
earn 8s or 9s a week in addit to their board and lodg
i ask the offic in charg what he had to sai as to the charg of
sweat and undersel which have been brought against the
salvat armi in connexion with thi and it other product
institut
he repli that thei neither sweat nor undersold the men whom thei
pick up had no valu in the labour market and could get noth to
do becaus no on would emploi them mani of them be the victim of
drink or entir unskil such peopl thei overlook hous fed
and instruct whether thei did or did not earn their food and
lodg and after the first week paid them upon a rise scale the
result were emin satisfactori as even allow for the
drunkard thei found that but few case not more than 10 per cent
were hopeless did thei not rescu these men most of them would sink
utterli inde accord to their own testimoni mani of such
wastrel were snatch from suicid as a matter of fact also thei
emploi more men per ton of paper than ani other dealer in the

ala the actor here plai in a tragedi more dread in it
cumul effect than ani that wa ever put upon the stage
thi shelter is wonderfulli equip and organ it contain
sit or restingroom smokingroom huge dormitori capabl of
accommod about 600 sleeper bathroom lavatori extens
hotwat and warm apparatu great kitchen and butteri and so
forth in the sit and smokingroom number of derelict men were
seat some did noth except stare befor them vacantli some
evid were suffer from the effect of drink or fatigu some
were read newspap which thei had pick up in the cours of
their dai tramp on i rememb wa engag in sort out and
crumpl up a number of cigar and cigarett end which he had
collect from the pavement carefulli grade the result in
differ heap accord to the class of the tobacco how strong it
must be either for hi own consumpt or for sale to other
unfortun in anoth place men were eat the 1d or 12d
supper that thei had purchas
earli as it wa howev the great dormitori were crowd with
hundr of the lodger either in bed or in process of get there
i notic that thei all undress themselv wrap up their rag
in bundl and for the most part slept quit nake mani of them
struck me as veri fine fellow physic and the reflect cross
my mind see them thu in puri naturalibu that there wa
littl inde to distinguish them from a crowd of male of the upper
class engag let us sai in bath it is the cloth that make the
differ to the ey
in thi shelter i wa told by the wai that there exist a code of
rough honour among these peopl who veri rare attempt to steal
anyth from each other have so littl properti thei sternli
respect it right i should add that the charg made for
accommod and food is 3d per night for sleep and 1d or 12d
per portion of food
the sight of thi institut crowd with human derelict struck me
as most sad more so inde than mani other that i have seen though
perhap thi mai have been becaus i wa myself tire out with a long
dai of inspect
the staffcaptain in charg here told me hi histori which is so
typic and interest that i will repeat it briefli mani year ago
he is now an elderli man he wa a steward on board a p and o
liner and do well then a terribl misfortun overwhelm him
suddenli hi wife and child di and as a result of the shock he
took to drink he attempt to cut hi throat the scar remain to
him and wa put upon hi trial for the offenc subsequ he
drift on to the street where he spent eight year dure all thi
time hi object wa to be rid of life the method he adopt be to
make himself drunk with methyl spirit or ani other villain
and fieri liquor and when that fail to sleep at night in wet grass
or ditch onc he wa pick up suffer from inflamm of the
lung and carri to an infirmari where he lai senseless for three
dai the end of it wa that a salvat armi offic found him in
oxford street and took him to a shelter in burn street where he wa
bath and put to bed
that wa mani year ago and now he is to a great extent respons
for the manag of thi westminst refug commission sturgess
on of the head offic of the armi told me that their great
difficulti wa to prevent him from overdo himself at thi
charit task i think the commission said that sometim he would
work eighteen or twenti hour out of the twentyfour
on dai thi staffcaptain plai a grim littl trick upon me i wa
seat at luncheon in a salvat armi build when the door open
and there enter as dread a human object as i have ever seen the
man wa clad in tatter hi bleed feet were bound up with filthi
rag he wore a dingi newspap for a shirt hi face wa cut and
plaster over roughli he wa a disgust sight he told me in
huski accent that drink had brought him down and that he want
help i made a few appropri remark present him with a small
coin and sent him to the offic downstair
a quarter of an hour later the staffcaptain appear in hi uniform
and explain that he and the object were the same person again it
wa the cloth that made the differ those which he had worn when
he appear at the luncheont were the same in which he had been
pick up on the street of london also he thank me for my good
advic which he said he hope to follow and for the sixpenc that he
announc hi intent of wear on hi watchchain for my part i
felt that the laugh wa against me perhap if i had thought the
salvat armi capabl of perpetr a joke i should not have been
so easili deceiv
thi staffcaptain gave me much inform as to the class of
wander who frequent these shelter he estim that about 50 per
cent of them sink to that level through the effect of drink that is
to sai if by the wave of some magic wand intoxic and harm
drug should ceas to be obtain in thi countri the bulk of
extrem miseri which need such succour and it mai be ad of crime
at larg would be lessen by onehalf thi is a terribl statement
and on that seem to excus a great deal of what is call teetot
fanatic the rest in hi view ow their fall to misfortun of
variou kind which often in it turn lead to flight to the delus
and destroi solac of drink thu about 25 per cent of the total
have been afflict with sick or acut domest troubl or
perhap thei ar knock out by shock such as is brought on by the
loss of a dearlylov wife or child and have never been abl to
recov from that crush blow the remaind ar the victim of
advanc ag and of the cruel commerci competit of our dai thu
he said that the larg busi firm destroi and devour the small
shopkeep as a hawk devour sparrow and these littl peopl or
their employ if thei ar past middl ag can find no other work
especi is thi the case sinc the employ liabil act came
into oper for now few will take on hand who ar not young and
veri strong as older folk must natur be more liabl to sick
and accid
again he told me that it ha becom the custom in larg busi of
which the dividend ar fall to put in a man call an
organ who is often an american
thi organ goe through the whole staff and mercilessli dismiss
the elderli or the least effici divid up their work among those
who remain so these discard men fall to rise no more and drift to
the poorhous or the shelter or the jail and final into the river
or a pauper grave first howev mani spend what mai be call a
period of probat on the street where thei sleep at night under
arch or on stairwai or on the inhospit flagston and bench
of the embank even in winter
the staffcaptain inform me that on on night dure the previou
novemb he count no less than 120 men women and children sleep
in the wet on or in the neighbourhood of the embank think of
itin thi on place think of it you whose women and children to
sai noth of yourselv do not sleep on the embank in the wet
in novemb it mai be answer that thei might have gone to the
casual ward where there ar gener vacanc i suppos that thei
might but so pervers ar mani of them that thei do not inde
often thei declar bluntli that thei would rather go to prison than to
the casual ward as in prison thei ar more kindli treat
the reader mai have note as he drove along the embank or other
london thoroughfar at night in winter long queue of peopl wait
their turn to get someth what thei ar wait for is a cup of
soup and perhap an opportun of shelter till the dawn which
soup and shelter ar suppli by the salvat armi and sometim by
other charit organ i ask whether thi provis of
grati food did in fact pauper the popul as ha been alleg
the staffcaptain answer that men do not as a rule stop out in the
middl of the winter till past midnight to get a pint of soup and a
piec of bread of cours there might be except but for the most
part those who take thi chariti do so becaus if is sore need
the cost of these midnight meal is reckon by the salvat armi at
about 8 per 1000 includ the labour involv in cook and
distribut thi monei is paid from the armi central fund which
collect subscript for that special purpos
of cours our midnight soup ha it critic said on of the
offic who ha charg of it distribut but all i know is that
it save mani from jump into the river
dure the past winter that is from novemb 3 1909 to march 24
1910 163101 person receiv free accommod and food at the
hand of the salvat armi in connexion with it embank soup
distribut chariti
the free breakfast servic
blackfriar shelter
on a sundai in june i attend the free breakfast servic at the
blackfriar shelter the leas of thi build wa acquir by the
salvat armi from a temper compani behind it lai contractor
stabl which were also bought after which the premis were rebuilt
and alter to suit the purpos to which thei ar now put the
stabl be for the most part convert into sleepingroom
the offic who accompani me lieutcolonel jolliff explain
that thi blackfriar shelter is as it were the dredger for and the
feeder of all the salvat armi social institut for men in
london inde it mai be liken to a dragnet set to catch male
unfortun in thi part of the metropoli here as in the other
armi shelter ar great number of bunk that ar hire out at 3d a
night and the usual foodkitchen and applianc
i visit on or two of these wellventil place that in cold
weather ar warm by mean of hotwat pipe to a heat of about 70
deg as the cloth on the bunk is light
i observ that although the room had onli been vacat for a few
hour thei were perfectli inoffens and even sweet a result that
is obtain by a veri strict attent to cleanli and ampl
ventil the floor of these place ar constantli scrub and
the bunk undergo a process of disinfect about onc a week as a
consequ in all the armi shelter the vermin which sometim
troubl common lodginghous ar almost unknown
i mai add that the closest supervis is exercis in these place
when thei ar occupi night watchmen ar alwai on duti and an
offic sleep in a littl apart attach to each dormitori the
result is that there ar practic no troubl of ani kind
sometim howev a poor wander is found dead in the morn in
which case the bodi is quietli convei awai to await inquest
i ask what happen when men who could not produc the necessari
copper to pai for their lodg appli for admiss the answer
wa that the matter wa left to the discret of the offic in
charg in fact in case of absolut and piteou want men ar
admit free although natur enough the armi doe not advertis
that thi happen if it did it hospit would be consider
overtax
leav the dormitori i enter the great hall in which were
gather nearli 600 men seat upon bench everi on of which wa
fill the face and gener aspect of these men were eloqu of
want and sorrow some of them appear to be intent upon the religi
servic that wa go on attend at thi servic be the
condit on which the free breakfast is given to all who need food
and have pass the previou night in the street other were gaze
about them vacantli and other suffer from the effect of drink
debaucheri or fatigu seem to be half comatos or asleep
thi congreg the strangest that i have ever seen compris men
of all class some might onc have belong to the learn
profess while other had fallen so low that thei look scarc
human everi grade of ragclad miseri wa repres here and everi
stage of life from the lad of sixteen up to the ag man whose
allot span wa almost at an end rank upon rank of them there thei
sat in their infinit varieti link onli by the common bond of utter
wretched the most melancholi sight i think that ever my ey
beheld all of them howev were fairli clean for thi matter had
been seen to by the offic who attend upon them the salvat armi
doe not onli wash the feet of it guest but the whole bodi also
it dri and purifi their tatter garment
when i enter the hall an offic on the platform wa engag in
offer up an extempor prayer
we prai that the holi spirit mai be pour out upon these men we
prai o god that thou wilt help them to take fresh courag to find
fresh hope and that thei mai rise onc again to fight the battl of
life we prai that thou mayst bring to thy feet thi morn such as
shall be save etern
then anoth offic style the chaplain address the audienc he
told them that there wa a wai out of their troubl and that
hundr who had sat in that hall as thei did now bless the dai
which brought them there he said you came here thi morn you
scarc knew how or why you did not know the hand of god wa lead
you and that he will bless you if you will listen to hi voic you
think you cannot escap from thi wretch life you think of the past
with all it failur but do not troubl about the year that ar
gone seek the kingdom of god and hi righteous and all other
thing shall be ad unto you then there will be no more wander
about without a friend for i sai to you that god live and thi
morn you will hear from other who onc were in a similar
condit to yourself what he ha done for them
next a man with a fine tenor voic who it seem is nicknam the
yorkshir canari sang the hymn begin god move in a mysteri
wai after thi in plain forcibl languag he told hi own stori he
said that he wa well brought up by a good father and mother and lost
everyth through hi own sin hi voic wa in a sens hi ruin
sinc he us to sing in publichous and saloon and there learnt to
drink at length he found himself upon the street in london and
tramp thenc to yorkshir to throw himself upon the merci of hi
parent when he wa quit close to hi home howev hi courag
fail him and he tramp back to london where he wa pick up by
the salvat armi
thi man a most respectablelook person is now a clerk in a
wellknown busi hous in hi own word i knelt down and gave my
heart to god and am todai in a good situat
next a salvat armi soldier spoke four year befor he had attend
the sundai morn meet in thi hall and found the friendship of
god he ha help me to regain the manhood i had lost and to do my
duti for two year now i have help to support an invalid sister
instead of be a burden to everi on i knew as onc i wa
after the sing of the hymn rock of ag anoth man address
the meet he had been a drunkard a homeless wander who slept
night after night on the embank till fortun brought him to thi
servic and to the penitentform sinc that time two and a half
year befor no drink had pass hi lip and onc again as he
declar he had becom a selfrespect respect citizen
then a dwarf whom i had seen at work in the spa road elev and who
onc wa taken about the countri to be exhibit as a side show at
fair and there fell a victim to drink gave hi testimoni
anoth vers could my tear for ever flow and after it in rapid
success spoke a man who had been a schoolmast and fallen through
drink and gambl a man who or whose brother i am not sure which
had been a wesleyan preacher and who is now emploi in a life
assur compani a man who had been a prison a man who had been a
confirm drunkard and other
alwai it wa the same earnest simpl tale of drink and degrad
pass now for ever of the penitentform of the build up of a new
self and of posit regain
more sing and an eloqu prayer which seem to move the audienc
veri much some of them to tear an address from a woman salvat
armi offic who plead with the peopl in the name of their
mother and a brief but excel sermon from commission sturgess
base upon the parabl of the marriag of the king son as record
in the 22nd chapter of st matthew and of the guest who were
collect from the highwai and bywai to attend the feast whenc the
rich and worldli had excus themselv
then the great and final invoc to heaven to move the heart of
these men and the invit to them to present themselv at the
penitentform lastli a mighti thunder hymn jesu lover of my
soul and the end of the long drama
it wa a wonder thing to see the spirituallyfac man on the
platform plead with hi sordid audienc and to watch them stir
beneath hi word to see also a uniform woman flit to and fro
among that audienc whisper exhort invokinga temptress to
salvat then to note the respons and it manner that were stranger
still some poor wretch would seem to awaken onli to relaps into a
state of sullen almost defiant torpor a littl while and the leaven
begin to work in him he flush mutter someth half rise from
hi seat sit down again rise onc more and with a peculiar
unwil gait stagger to the penitentform and in an abandon of
grief and repent throw himself upon hi knee and there begin to
sob a watch offic come to him kneel at hi side and i
suppos confess him the tremend hymn burst out like a paean of
triumph
just as i am without on plea
it begin the rest i forget or did not catch
now the ic is broken anoth come and anoth and anoth till
there is no more room at the penitentbench thei swarm on to the
platform which is clear for them and there kneel down and i
observ the nake feet of some of them show through the wornout
boot
so it goe on at length the great audienc rise and begin to
depart file on by on through a certain doorwai as thei pass
offic who have appear from somewher wait for them with
outstretch arm the most of them brush past shake their head and
mutter here and there on paus is lostor rather won the
salvat armi ha him in it net and he join the crowd upon the
platform still the hymn swell and fall till all have depart save
those who remain for goodabout 10 per cent of that sad compani
illustr seek the homeless at midnight
it is done and the catcher feel that he ha wit the veri
uttermost of tragedi human and spiritu
mere common reviv the critic will sai and it mai be so still
such reviv if that is the term for it must be judg by it
fruit i am inform that of those who kneel here experi show
that but a small percentag relaps the most of them becom what in
the salvat armi cantif on choos so to name iti known as
save
thi mean that from drunkard and wastrel stain with everi sort of
human fault or even crime thei ar turn into godfear and
respect men who henceforward instead of be a pest to societi
and a terror to all those who have the misfortun to be connect with
them becom prop of societi and a comfort and a support to their
rel and friend
thu is the mesh of merci spread and such is it harvest
the ag of miracl is past we ar told but i confess that while
watch thi strang sight i wonder more than onc that if thi
were so what that ag of miracl had been like of on thing i wa
sure that it must have been to such as these that he who is
acknowledg even by sceptic to have been the veri master of mankind
would have chosen to preach had thi been the ag of hi appear
he who came to call sinner to repent probabl too it wa to
such as these that he did preach for folk of thi charact ar
common to the gener doubtless judea had it knave and
drunkard as we know it had it victim of sick and misfortun
the devil that were cast out in jerusalem did not die thei reappear
in london and elsewher todai and it would seem can still be cast
out
i confess anoth thing also name that i found all thi drama
curious excit most of us who have pass middl ag and led a
full and vari life will be familiar with the great human emot
yet i discov here a new emot on quit foreign to a somewhat
extend experi on that i cannot even attempt to defin the
contagion of reviv again it will be said thi mai be so or it
mai not but at least so far as thi branch of the salvat armi
work is concern those engag in it mai fairli claim that the tree
should be judg by it fruit without doubt in the main these
fruit ar good and wholesom
i have onli to add to my descript of thi remark servic that
the number net name about 10 per cent of those present wa i
am told just normal neither more nor less than the averag some of
these doubtless will relaps but if onli on of them remain realli
reform sure the salvat armi ha vindic it argument and
all is prove to be well worth while but to that on veri mani
cipher must be ad as the clear and prove result of the forti
year or so of it activ whatev mai be doubt thi is true
beyond all controversi for it number it convert by the thousand
the congreg which i saw on thi particular occas seem to me
to consist for the most part of elderli men in fact some of them
were veri old and the averag ag of those who attend the
penitentform i estim at about thirtyf year thi howev
vari i am inform that at time thei ar mostli young person it
must be rememberedand the statement throw a lurid light upon the
condit prevail in london as in other of our great citiesthat
the popul which week by week attend these sundai morn
servic is of an evershift charact doubtless there ar some
habitu and other who reappear from time to time but the most of
the audienc is new everi saturdai night the highwai and the hedg
or rather the street and the railwai arch yield a new crop of
homeless and quit destitut wander these ar gather into the
blackfriar shelter and go their bitter road again after the rest
the breakfast and the servic but as we have seen here a substanti
proport about 10 per cent remain behind these ar all
interview separ and fed and on the follow morn as mani
of them as vacanc can be found for in the paper work elev or
elsewher ar sent thither
i saw plenti of these men and with them other who had been rescu
previous so mani inde that it is imposs to set out their
separ case look through my note made at the time i find
among them a schoolmast an australian who fought in south africa a
publican who had lost 2000 in specul and been twelv month on
the street a sailor and two soldier who between them had seen much
servic abroad and a univers man who had tri to commit suicid
from london bridg
also there wa a person who wa recent describ in the newspap
as the dirtiest man in london he wa found sit on the step of
a larg build in queen victoria street partli paralys from
exposur so filthi and vermin wa he that it wa necessari to
scrape hi bodi which mere wash would not touch when he wa
pick up a crowd of sever hundr peopl follow him down the
street attract by hi dread appear hi pocket were full of
filth amongst which were found 5s in copper he had then been a
month in the shelter where he peel or peel potato etc and
look quit bright and clean
most of these peopl had been brought down by the accurs drink
which is the bane of our nation and some few by sheer misfortun
neither at the servic nor afterward did i see a singl jew for
the fallen of that race seem to be look after by their fellow
religionist moreov the jew do not drink to excess foreign
also ar compar scarc at blackfriar and in the other
shelter
the excrimin
on the afternoon of the sundai on which i visit the blackfriar
shelter i attend anoth servic conduct by commission
sturgess at quaker street
here the room wa fill by about 150 men all of whom had been
rescu and were then work in the variou shelter or elsewher i
mai sai that i have seldom seen a congreg of more respect
appear and never on that join with greater earnest in a
religi servic
i will take thi opportun to observ that the salvat armi
enforc no religi test upon those to whom it extend it
assist if a man is a member of the church of england or a roman
cathol for instanc and wish to remain so all that it tri to
do is to make him a good member of hi church it onli sine qua non
is that the individu should show himself readi to work zealous at
ani task which it mai be abl to find for him
the rest of that afternoon i spent in interview excrimin who
were then in the charg of the salvat armi to give detail of
their case in thi book is imposs here i will onli sai
therefor that some of these had been most desper charact who
had serv as much as thirti or forti year in variou prison or
even been condemn to death for murder inde the nineteen men whom
i interview had between them done 371 year of what is known as
time
i cannot honestli report that i like the look of all these gentri
or believ everyth that thei told me for instanc when such
peopl swear that thei have been wrongli convict an old lawyer and
magistr like myself who know what pain ar taken by everi
english court to safeguard the innoc is apt to be sceptic
still it should be ad that mani of these jailbird ar now to all
appear quit reform while some of them ar do well in more
or less respons posit under the supervis of the armi
the salvat armi offic have author from the home offic to
visit the variou prison where the inmat ar inform that those
who ar desir of see them must give in their name then on a
certain dai the offic who under commission sturgess is
respons for the prison work of the armi in england appear at the
wandsworth or the pentonvil prison or wherev it mai be there he
find perhap as mani as 150 men wait to see him the total
number of exprison who pass through the hand of the armi in
england averag at present about 1000 per annum he interview
these men in their cell privat the prison offici remain
outsid and stop as long with each of them as he deem to be
need for the governor of the prison give him everi opportun
of attain the object of hi work thi offic inform me that hi
convers with the prison is not restrict in ani wai it mai
be about their futur or of spiritu matter or it mai have to do
with their famili affair
the detail of each case ar carefulli record in a book which i saw
and when a convict is discharg and given over to the care of the
armi a photograph and an offici statement of hi record is
furnish with him thi statement the armi find a great help as in
deal with such peopl it is necessari to know their past in order
to be abl to guard against their weak point
the govern author have now begun to seek the aid of the armi
in certain special case if thei feel that it is unnecessari to
retain a man ani longer thei will sometim hand him over should the
salvat armi offic be will to take him in and be respons
for him gener booth and hi subordin think that if thi system
were enlarg and follow up it would result in the mitig or
the abbrevi of mani sentenc without expos the public to
danger
in discuss thi matter with them i ventur to point out that it
would be a bad thing if the armi becam in ani wai identifi with the
prison author and began at ani rate in the mind of the crimin
class to wear the initi gr instead of those of the armi upon
their collar thi wa not disput by commission sturgess with
whom i debat the question
what the armi desir howev is that the govern should
subsid thi work in order to enabl it to support the exconvict
until it can find opportun to place them in posit where thei
can earn their own bread the troubl with such folk is that
natur enough few desir to emploi them and until thei ar
emploi which in the case of ag person or of those with a veri
bad record mai be never thei must be fed cloth and hous
after go into the whole subject at consider length and in much
detail the conclus which i came to wa that thi work of the
visit of prison by salvat armi offic and the care of
them when releas either on or befor the complet of their
sentenc is on that might be usefulli extend should the home
offic author see fit so to do there is no doubt although it
cannot guarante success in everi case that the salvat armi is
peculiarli success in it deal with harden crimin
why thi is so is not easi to explain i think howev that there
ar two main reason for it success the first is that the armi take
great care never to break a promis which it mai make through ani of
it offic thu if a man in jail is told that hi rel will
be hunt up and commun with or that an applic will be
made to the author to have him commit to the care of the armi
or that work will be found for him on hi releas and the like that
undertak whatev it mai be is note in the book which i have
mention and although year mai pass befor it can be fulfil is
in due cours carri out to the letter now convict ar shy bird
who put littl faith in promis but when thei find that these ar
alwai kept thei gain confid in the maker of them and often
learn to trust them entir
the second and more potent reason is to be found in the power of that
love sympathi which the armi extend even to the vilest to those
from whom the least puritan of us would shrink it show such men
that thei ar not utterli lost as these believ that it at ani
rate doe not mark them with a figur broad arrow and consign
them to a separ divis of societi that it is abl to give them
back the selfrespect without which mankind is lower than the beast
and to place them regener upon a path that if it be steep and
thorni still lead to those height of peac and honour which thei
never thought to tread again
thi is done not by physic care and comfort though of cours
these help toward the desir end but by it own spiritu mean or
so it would appear it offic prai with the man thei awak hi
conscienc which is never dead in ani of us thei pour the bless
light of hope into the dark place of hi soul thei caus him to hate
the past and to desir to lead a new life onc thi desir is
establish the rest is compar simpl for where the heart
lead the feet will follow but without it littl or noth can be
done such is the explan i have to offer at ani rate i believ
it remain a fact that among the worst crimin the salvat armi
often succe where other have fail
anoth point that should not be overlook in thi connexion is that
it must be a great comfort to the sinner and an encourag of the
most practic sort to find as he sometim will that the hand
which ar drag him and hi kind from the mire had onc been as
filthi as hi own when the worker can sai to him look at me in
bygon dai i wa as bad as or wors than you when he can point to
mani other whose vice were formerli notori but who now fill
posit of trust in the armi or outsid of it and ar honour of
all men then the lost on emerg perhap for the fifth or sixth
time from the dark of hi prison see by the light of these
concret exampl that the futur ha promis for us all if thei
have succeed why should he fail that is the argument which come
home to him
there remain a matter to be consid let us suppos that as time
goe by the author becom more and more convinc of the valu of
the armi prison work and pass over to it care crimin in
everincreas number as thei ar do in some other countri and
in the great coloni what will be the effect upon the armi itself
will not thi mass of compar useless materi clog the wheel
of the great machin by overlad it with a vast number of
exprison some of whom ow to their ag or other circumst
ar quit incap of earn their livelihood and therefor must be
carri till their death when i put the queri to those in command
the answer given wa that thei did not think so as thei believ that
the armi would be abl to turn the great major of these men into
respect wageearn member of societi
thu of those who have been sent to it late from the prison it
ha i understand been forc to return onli two becaus these men
would not behav themselv and prove to be a sourc of danger and
contamin to other as regard the residuum who ar incapacit
by ag or weak of mind or bodi gener booth and hi offic ar
of opinion that the govern should contribut to their support in
such place as the armi mai be abl to find for them to dwell in under
it care
i hope that these forecast which after all ar made by men of great
experi who should know mai not prove to be oversanguin still
it must be rememb that in england alon there ar i am told some
30000 confirm crimin in the jail not reckon the 5000 who
ar class as convict if even 20 per cent of these were pass over
to the care of the armi with or without state grant in aid of their
support thi must in the natur of thing prove a heavi burden upon
it resourc when all is said and done it is harder to find
employ for a jailbird even if reform than for ani other class
of man becaus so damag a human articl ha but littl commerci
valu in the labour market
if howev the salvat armi is prepar to face thi gigant
task it mai be hope that it will be given an opportun of show
what it can do on a larg scale as it ha alreadi shown upon on more
restrict prison reform is in the air the present system is
admit more or less to have broken down it ha been shown to be
incompet to attain the real end for which it is establish that
is not punish as mani still believ for thi hereditari idea is
hard to erad but prevent and still more reform
the vengeanc of the law is a phrase not easi to forget but among
human and highlycivil peopl the word vengeanc should be
replac by anoth the best that i can think of isregener
the law should not seek to avengethat mai be left to the savag
code civil and religi of the dark ag except in the case of
the death sentenc which is not everywher in favour it should seek
to regener
if then among other agenc the salvat armi is abl to prove
beyond cavil that it can assist our crimin system to attain thi
nobl end ought not opportun to be given it in full measur is it
too much to hope that when the new prison act of which the substanc
ha recent been outlin by the home secretari come to be
discuss thi object mai be kept in view and the offer of the
salvat armi to cooper in the great endeavour mai not be lightli
thrust asid if it help is found so valuabl in the solut of thi
particular problem in other land why should it be reject here or
rather why should it not be more larg util as i know from
their own lip gener booth and hi offic hope and desire2
the men workshop
hanburi street whitechapel
thi salvat armi carpent and joineri shop ha been in
exist for about fifteen year but it doe not even now pai it
wai it wa start by the armi in order to assist fallen mechan by
give them temporari work until thei could find other situat
the manag inform me that at the begin thei found work for
about thirti men when i visit the place some fifti hand were
employedbricklay painter joiner etc none of whom need stop
an hour longer than thei choos from 100 to 150 men pass through thi
workshop in a year but mani of them be elderli and therefor
unabl to obtain work elsewher stop for a long while as the armi
cannot well get rid of them all of these folk arriv in a state of
absolut destitut have even sold their tool the last
possess with which a compet workman part
the parliamentari committe of the labour parti and the trade union
have recent stir up a great agit which ha been wide
report in the press against the hanburi street workshop becaus
the armi doe not pai the union rate of wage as a result the armi
now declin all outsid contract and confin it oper to the
work of erect repair or furnish it own build
here it mai be state that these complaint seem to be unreason
the men emploi have almost without except been taken off the
street to save them from starvat or the poorhous often enough
thei ar by no mean compet at their work while some of them have
for the time be been render practic useless through the
effect of drink or other debaucheri yet it is argu with violenc
that to such peopl whom no busi firm would emploi upon ani
term the armi ought to pai the full trade union rate of wage when
everi allow is made for the great and urgent problem connect
with the cruel practic of sweat sure thi attitud throw a
strang light upon some of the method of the trade union
the infer seem to be that thei would prefer that these derelict
should come on the rate or starv rather than that the armi should
hous and feed them give them in addit such wage as their
labour mai be worth further comment seem to be needless especi
when i repeat that as i am assur thi hanburi street institut
never ha earn and doe not now earn the cost of it upkeep
it is situat in the heart of a veri poor district and is rather a
ramshackl place to look at but still quit suitabl to it purpos
i have observ that on of the characterist of the salvat armi
is that it never spend unnecessari monei upon build if it can
bui a good hous or other suitabl structur cheap it doe so if it
cannot it make us of what it can get at a price within it mean
provid that the place will satisfi the requir of the sanitari
and other author
all the machin at hanburi street ar driven by electr power that
is suppli by the stepnei council at a cost of 1d per unit for
power and 3d per unit for light
an elderli man whom i saw there attend to thi machineri wa
dismiss by on of the great railwai compani when thei were
reduc their hand he had been in the emploi of the salvat armi
for seven year and receiv the us of a hous rent free and a wage
of 30 a week which probabl he would find it quit imposs to
earn anywher els
the hour of employ ar from 630 am to 530 pm if the man is
engag on outsid work or to 6 pm if he labour in the workshop
and the men ar paid at variou rate accord to the valu of their
work and whether thei ar board and lodg or live outsid thu
on to whom i spoke who wa the son of a former mayor of an import
town wa allow 3s a week plu food and lodg while anoth
receiv 9s a week 5s of which wa sent to hi wife from whom
he wa separ anoth man after live on the armi for about two
year made charg against it to the carpent and joiner union
he return and apolog but had practic to be kept under
restraint on account of hi drink habit
anoth man spent twenti year in jail and then walk the street he
is now a veri respect person earn 27 6d a week and live
outsid with hi wife and famili anoth wa onc convict of
cruelti to hi children whom he place under the board of the
floor while he went out to drink these children ar now restor
to him and he live with them anoth among those with whom i
happen to speak wa rob by a rel of 4000 which hi father
left to him he wa taken on by the armi in a state of destitut
but i forget what he earn anoth the youngest man in the work
came to them without ani trade at all and in a destitut condit
but when i saw him wa in charg of a mortic machin he had
marri live out and had been in the emploi of the armi for five
year hi wage wa 27 6d a week two other drew as much as 2
5s 11d each live out but on the other hand some receiv
as littl as 3s a week with board and lodg
amongst thi latter class wa a young mormon from salt lake citi who
earn 4s 6d a week and hi board and lodg he had been in
the elev about three month have got drunk in london and miss
hi ship although he attend the salvat armi meet he
remain a mormon
in these work all sort of articl ar manufactur to be us by
other branch of the salvat armi thu i saw poultryhous be
made for the boxt small hold these cost from 4 5s to 4
10 net and were excel structur design to hold about two
dozen fowl further on larg number of seat of differ pattern
were in process of manufactur some of them for children and other
longer on with revers back to be us in the numer armi
hall next i visit a room in which mattress and mattress cover
ar made for the variou shelter also the waterproof bunk bed
which cost 7s 9d per cover further on in a separ
compart wa a flocktear machin at which the mormon i have
mention wa emploi thi is a veri dusti job whereat a man doe
not work for more than on dai in ten
then there were the paint and polishingroom the joineri room and
the room where door window frame and articl of furnitur ar
construct also special garden bench cleverli plan so that the
seat can be protect from rain these were design by a young ladi
whom i chanc to know in privat life and who as i now discov
for the first time is also a member of the salvat armi
such is the hanburi street workshop where the armi make the best us
it can of rather indiffer human materi and as i have said
lose monei at the busi
sturg hous bow road
thi branch of the men social work of the salvat armi is a home
for poor and destitut boi the hous which onc belong to the
late dr barnardo ha been recent hire on a short leas on of
the featur of the armi work is the reclam of lad of whom
about 2400 have pass through it hand in london dure the cours
of the last eight year
sturg hous ha been fit up for thi special purpos and
accommod about fifti boi the offic in charg inform me that
some boi appli to them for assist when thei ar out of work
while other come from bad home and yet other through the shelter
which pass on suitabl lad each case is strictli investig when
it arriv with the result that about onethird of their number ar
restor to their parent from whom often enough thei have run awai
sometim upon the most flimsi pretext
not unfrequ these boi ar bad charact who tell fals tale
of their past thu recent two who arriv at the headquart at
whitechapel alleg that thei were farmlabour from norfolk as
thei did not in the least look the part inquiri were made when it
wa found that thei had never been nearer to norfolk than hampstead
where both of them had been concern in the steal of 10 from a
busi firm the matter wa patch up with the intervent of the
armi and the boi were restor to their parent
occasion too lad ar brought here by kind folk who find them
starv thei ar taken in kept for a while taught and fed and
when their charact ar reestablishedfor mani of them have none
leftput out into the world some of them inde work daili at
variou employ in london and pai 5s a week for their board and
lodg at the home a good proport of these lad also ar sent to
the collieri in wale where after a few year thei earn good
wage
in these collieri a man and a boi gener work togeth a while
ago such a man appli to the armi for a boi and the applic
prove respect the boi wa sent and turn out extrem well
in due cours he becam a collier himself and in hi turn sent for
a boi so the thing spread till up to the present time the armi ha
suppli fifti or sixti lad to collier in south wale all of whom
seem to be satisfactori and prosper
as the manag explain it is not difficult to place out a lad as
soon as hi charact can be more or less guarante the difficulti
come with a man who is middleag or old he ad that thi home
doe not in ani sens compet with those of dr barnardo in fact in
certain wai thei work hand in hand the barnardo home will not
receiv lad who ar over sixteen wherea the armi take them up to
eighteen so it come about that barnardo sometim send on case
which ar over their ag limit to sturg hous
i saw the boi at their dinner and although mani of them had a bad
record certainli thei look veri respect and like to make
good and us men the experi of the armi is that most of them
ar quit capabl of reform and that when onc their heart
have been chang thei seldom fall back into the wai of dishonesti
thi home like all those manag by the salvat armi is spotlessli
clean and the dormitori ar veri pleasant room also there is a
garden and in it i saw a number of pot of flower which had just
been sent as a present by a boi whom the armi help three year ago
and who is now i understand a garden
sturg hous struck me as a most us institut and as there is
about it none of the depress air of the adult shelter my visit
here wa a pleasant chang the reclam or the help of a lad is
a veri differ busi from that of restor the adult or the old
man to a station in life which he seem to have lost for ever
the central labour bureau
thi bureau is establish in the social headquart at whitechapel
a larg build acquir as long ago as 1878 here is to be seen the
room in which gener booth us to hold some of hi first prayer
meet and a littl chamber where he took counsel with those
offic who were the father of the armi also there is a place where
he could sit unseen and listen to the preach of hi subordin
so that he might judg of their abil
the larg hall is now part of yet anoth shelter which contain 232
bed and bunk i inspect thi place but as it differ in no
import detail from other i will not describ it
the offic who is in charg of the labour bureau inform me that
hundr of men appli there for work everi week of whom a great mani
ar sent into the variou elev and shelter the armi find it
extrem difficult to procur outsid employ for these men for
the simpl reason that there is veri littl avail moreov now
that the govern labour bureaux ar open thi troubl is not
lessen of these bureaux the manag said that thei ar most
us but fail to find employ for mani who appli to them
inde number of men come on from them to the salvat armi
the hard fact is that there ar more idl hand than there is work for
them to do even where honest and capabl folk ar concern thu in
the major of instanc the armi is oblig to reli upon it own
institut and the hadleigh land coloni to provid some sort of job
for outofwork of cours of such job there ar not enough to go
round so mani poor folk must be sent empti awai or support by
chariti
i suggest that it might be worth while to establish a school of
chauffeur and the offic present said that thei would consid the
matter unfortun howev such an experi must be costli at
the present price of motorvehicl

the intern investig depart
thi is a curiou and interest branch of the work of the salvat
armi about two thousand time a year it receiv letter or person
applic ask it to find some miss rel or friend of the
writer or applic in repli a form is post or given which must
be fill up with the necessari particular then if it be a london
case the offic in charg send out a skill man to work up clue
if on the other hand it be a countri case the offic in charg of
the corp nearest to where it ha occur is instruct to initi
the inquiri also advertis ar insert in the armi paper
known as the war cry and the social gazett both in great britain
and other countri if the lost person is suppos to be on the
contin or in some distant part of the world
the result is that a larg percentag of the individu sought for
ar discov aliv or dead for in such work the salvat armi ha
advantag deni to ani other bodi scarc except the polic
it repres ar everywher and to whatev land thei mai
belong or whatev tongu thei mai speak all of them obei an order
sent out from headquart wholeheartedli and uninfluenc by the
question of regard the usual fee charg for thi work is 10
6d but when thi cannot be paid a larg number of case ar
undertaken free the armi goe to as much troubl in these unpaid
case as in ani other onli then it is not abl to flood the countri
with print bill of cours where welltodo peopl ar concern
it expect that it outofpocket cost will be met
the case with which it ha to deal ar of all kind often those who
have disappear ar found to have done so purpos perhap leav
behind them manufactur evid such as coat or letter on a
riverbank suggest that thei have commit suicid gener
these peopl ar involv in some fraud or other troubl again
husband desert their wive or wive their husband and vanish in
which instanc thei ar probabl live with somebodi els under
anoth name or children ar kidnap or girl ar lure awai or
individu emigr to far land and neglect to write or perhap
thei simpli sink out of all knowledg and vanish effectu enough
into a pauper grave
but the oddest case of all ar those of a complet loss of memori a
thing that is by no mean so infrequ as is gener suppos the
experi of the armi is that the major of these case happen
among those who lead a studiou life the victim goe out in hi usual
health and suddenli forget everyth hi mind becom a total
blank yet certain instinct remain such as that of earn a live
thu to take a singl recent exampl the son of a larg booksel
in a countri town left the hous on dai sai that he would not be
awai for long and disappear at the invit of hi father the
armi took up the case and ultim found that the man had been
work in it spa road elev under anoth name afterward he
went awai becam destitut and sold match in the street
ultim he wa found in a church armi home he recov hi
memori and subsequ lost it again to the extent that he could
recal noth which happen to him dure the period of it first
laps all that time vanish into total dark
thi busi of the hunt out of the miss through the agenc of
the salvat armi is on which increas everi dai it is not unusu
for the armi to discov individu who have been miss for thirti
year and upward
the emigr depart
some year ago i wa present on night in the boardroom at euston
station and address a shipload of emigr who were depart to
canada under the auspic of the salvat armi i forget their exact
number but i think it wa not less than 500 what i do not forget
howev is the sorrow that i felt at see so mani men in the prime
of life leav the shore of their countri for ever especi as
most of them were not marri thi meant amongst other thing that
an equal number of women who remain behind were depriv of the
possibl of obtain a husband in a countri in which the femal
alreadi outnumb the male by more than a million i said as much in
the littl speech i made on thi occas and i think that some on
answer me with the pertin remark that if there wa no work at
home it must be sought abroad
illustr inmat of a men industri home
there li the whole problem in a nutshellmen must live as for the
ag and the incompet and the sick and the unattach women these
ar left behind for the commun to support while young and activ
men of energi move off to endow new land with their capac and
strength the result of thi movement carri out upon a great
scale can be seen in the remot part of ireland which as the
visitor will observ appear to be larg popul by veri young
children and by person get on in year whether or no thi is a
satisfactori state of affair is not for me to sai although the
matter too larg to discuss here is on upon which i mai have my own
opinion
colonel lamb the head of the salvat armi emigr depart
inform me that dure the past seven year the armi ha emigr
about 50000 soul of whom 10000 were assist out of it fund the
rest pai their own wai or be paid for from on sourc or
anoth from 8000 to 10000 peopl have been sent dure the present
year 1910 most of them to canada which is the mecca of the
salvat armi emigr polici so carefulli have all these peopl
been select that not 1 per cent have ever been return to thi
countri by the canadian author as undesir the truth is that
those author have the greatest confid in the discret of
the armi and in it abil to handl thi matter to the advantag of
all concern
that thi is true i know from person experi sinc when some
year ago i wa a commission from the british govern and had
author to formul a scheme of coloni landsettl the prime
minist of canada sir wilfrid laurier told me so himself in the
plainest languag inde he did more formal offer a huge block
of territori to be select anywher i might choos in the dominion
with the aid of it offic for the purpos of settlement by poor
folk and their children under the auspic of the salvat armi
also he ad the promis of as much more land as might be requir
in the futur for the same purpose3
most unhappili as i hold that offer wa not accept by the british
govern if thi had been done by now hundr of english famili
would have been transfer from condit of want at home in the
english town into those of peac and plenti upon the land abroad
moreov the recent rise in the valu of canadian land ha been so
great that the scheme would not have cost the british taxpay a
halfpenni or so i most firmli believ
unfortun howev my scheme wa too novel in it charact to
appeal to the offici mind especi as it work would have
involv a loan repay by instal the administr of which
must have been entrust to the salvat armi or to other charit
organ so thi priceless opportun wa lost probabl for
ever as the new and stricter emigr regul adopt by
canada as i understand would make it extrem difficult to emigr
the class i hope to help name indig peopl of good charact
resid in english citi with grow famili of children
young men especi if thei have been bred on the land and young
marriag women ar eagerli desir in the coloni includ
australia but at famili as we have read in recent correspond
in the newspap thei look askanc
why do thei not want famili in australia i ask colonel lamb
becaus the troubl of hous come in it is the same thing in
canada it is the same thing all through the coloni thei do not
want too much troubl he answer
these word defin the posit veri accur give us your best
sai the coloni give us your adult healthi men and women whom you
have paid to rear and educ but dont bother us with famili of
children whom we have to hous abov all send us no damag articl
you ar welcom to keep those at home
to my mind thi attitud natur as it mai be creat a seriou
problem so far as great britain and ireland ar concern for the
question will aris can we afford to go on part with the good and
retain the less desir
on thi subject i had a long argument with colonel lamb and hi
answer to the question wa in the affirm although i must admit
that hi reason did not at all convinc me he seem to believ that
we could send out 250000 peopl chosen peopl per annum for the
next ten year without harm to ourselv well it mai be so and as
he ad we ar in their that is the coloni hand and have to
do what thei choos to allow
also hi opinion wa that the best thing possibl for thi countri is
wholesal emigr of cours of those whom the coloni will
accept he said peopl here ar dissatisfi with their present
condit and want a chang if we had monei to assist them there is
practic no limit to the number who want to go there ar ten of
thousand who would conform to the canadian regul on of the
thing we advis the man who ha been forc out of the countri is
that rather than come into the town he should go to the coloni
on the matter of the complaint which have been made in canada of the
emigr from london colonel lamb said the london it is alleg
is not want the canadian is full of selfassert and the
cocknei ha some of that too he doe not hesit to express hi
view and you have conflict spirit at onc the cocknei will
arriv at the conclus in about twentyfour hour that he could run
canada better than it is now be run the scotchman will take a week
to arriv at the same conclus and hold hi tongu about it the
cocknei sai what he think on the first dai of arriv and the
result isfirework he and the canadian do not agre to begin with
but when thei get over the first passag of arm thei settl down
amic the cocknei is final appreci and be industri
and amen to law and order if he ha got a bit of humour he get
on all right but not at first
colonel lamb inform me that in australia the labour parti is afraid
of the armi becaus it believ we will send in peopl to bring down
wage therefor the labour parti ha sidetrack gener booth
propos now howev it alleg that it is not oppos to
emigr if not on too larg a scale thei dont mind a few girl
but thei sai the condit that must preced emigr is the
break up of the land
colonel lamb appear to desir that an emigr board should be
appoint in england with power and fund to deal with the
distribut of the popul of the empir and to systemat
emigr to thi imperi board individu or societi such as
the salvat armi should he thought be abl to submit their
scheme which scheme would receiv assist accord to their
merit under such limit as the board might see fit to impos to
such a board he would even give power to carri out landsettl
scheme in the british isl
thi is a great propos but on wonder whenc the monei is to come
also how long will it be befor the labour parti in the variou
coloni includ canada gain so much power that thei will refus
to accept emigr at all except young women or agriculturalist
who bring capit with them
but all these problem ar for the futur meanwhil it is evid
that the salvat armi manag it emigr work with extraordinari
success and busi skill those whom it send from these shore for
their own benefit ar invari accept at ani rate in canada and
provid with work on their arriv in the chosen coloni that the
select is sound and care is shown also by the fact that the
armi recov from those emigr to whom it give assist a
consider percentag of the sum advanc to enabl them to start
life in a new land
the women social work in london
at the commenc of my investig of thi branch of the
salvat armi activ in england i discuss it gener aspect
with mr bramwel booth who ha it in her charg she point out to
me that thi women social work is a much larger busi than it wa
believ to be even by those who had some acquaint with the
salvat armi and that it deal with mani matter of great
import in their bear on the complex problem of our
civil
among them to take some that she mention which recur to my mind
ar the question of illegitimaci and prostitut of matern home
for poor girl who have fallen into troubl of women thiev of what
is known as the white slave traffic of femal children who have been
expos to aw treatment of women who ar drunkard or drugtak
of ag and destitut women of intract or viciousmind girl
and lastli of the train of young person to enabl them to deal
scientif with all these evil or under the name of slum
sister to wait upon the poor in their home and nurs them through
the trial of matern
how practic and effici thi train is no on can know who ha
not like myself visit and inquir into the variou institut
and refug of the armi in differ citi of the land it is a
wonder thing as ha happen to me again and again to see some
quiet middleag ladi often so shy that it is difficult to extract
from her the inform requir rule with the most perfect
success a number of young women who a few week or month befor
were the vilest of the vile and what is stranger still reform as
she rule these ladi exercis no sever the punish which
perhap necessarili is a lead featur in some of our govern
institut is unknown to their system i am told that no on is
ever struck no on is imprison no on is restrict in diet for
ani offenc as an offic said to me
if we cannot manag a girl by love we recogn that the case is
beyond us and ask her to go awai thi howev veri seldom
happen
as a matter of fact that case which is beyond the regener power
of the armi must be veri bad inde at ani rate where young peopl
ar concern in the vast major of instanc a cure is effect
and appar a perman cure in everi on of these home there is
a room reserv for the accommod of those who have pass through
it and gone out into the world again should thei care to return there
in their holidai or other interv of leisur that room is alwai
in great demand and i can imagin no more eloqu testimoni to the
manner of the treatment of it occup while thei dwelt in these
home as case
in truth a studi of the femal offic of the salvat armi is
calcul to convert the observ not onli to a belief in the right
of women to the suffrag but also to that of their fit to rule
among or even over men onli i never heard that ani of these ladi
ever sought such privileg moreov few of the sex would care to
win them at the price of the train selfdeni and stern
experi which it is their lot to undergo
mr bramwel booth point out to me that although the actual work of
the armi on these women question is more than just a littl it
had as it were onli touch their fring yet even thi fring ha
mani thread see that over 44000 of these women case have been
help in on wai or anoth sinc thi branch of the home work began
about twenti year ago
she ad that scarc a month goe by in which the armi doe not
break out in a new direct open a new institut or attempt to
attack a new problem and thi be it rememb not onli in these
island but over the face of half the earth at present it sphere of
influenc is limit by the lack of fund give it enough monei she
said and there is littl that it would not dare to try everywher
the harvest is plenti and if the worker remain compar few
it is becaus materi mean ar lack for their support given the
monei and the worker would be found nor will thei ask much for
mainten or salari enough to provid the necessari build and
to keep bodi and soul togeth that is all4
what ar these women do in london thei run more than a score of
home and agenc includ a matern hospit which i will
describ later where hundr of poor deceiv girl ar taken in
dure their troubl i believ it is almost the onli on of the sort
at ani rate on the same scale in that great citi
also thei manag variou home for drunken women it ha alwai been
suppos to be a practic imposs to effect a cure in such
case but the ladi offic of the salvat armi succe in turn
about 50 per cent of their patient into perfectli sober person at
least thei remain sober for three year from the date of their
discharg after which thei ar often follow no further
anoth of their object is to find out the father of illegitim
children and persuad them to sign a form of agreement which ha been
carefulli drawn by counsel bind themselv to contribut toward
the cost of the mainten of the child or fail thi should the
evid be suffici thei try to obtain affili order against
such father in a magistr court here i mai state that the amount
of affili monei collect in england by the armi in 1909 wa
1217 of which 208 wa for new case further 671 wa collect
and paid over for mainten to desert wive littl or none of
thi monei would have been forthcom but for it exert
mr bramwel booth inform me that there exist a class of young
men most of them in the emploi of tradesfolk who habitu amus
themselv by get servant girl into troubl often under a
promis of marriag then if the usual result follow it is common
for these men to move awai to anoth town take their refer
with them and sometim under a new name to repeat the process
there she wa of opinion that the ag of consent ought to be rais
to eighteen at least a cours for which there is much to be said
also she thought and thi is more controversi that when ani young
girl ha been seduc under promis of marriag the seduc should be
liabl to punish under the crimin law of cours on of the
difficulti here would be to prove the promis of marriag beyond all
reason doubt
also to bring such matter within the cogniz of the crimin law
would be a new and inde a danger departur not altogeth easi
to justifi especi as old magistr like myself who have
consider experi of such case must know it is not alwai the
man who is to blame person i inclin to the view that if the ag
of consent were rais and the contribut exact from the put
father of an illegitim child made proportion to hi mean and
not limit as it is now to a maximum of 5s a week the crimin
law might well be left out of the question it must be rememb
further as mr booth point out herself that there is anoth
remedi name that of a better hometrain of girl who should be
prepar by their mother or friend to face the danger of the world
a duti which these too often neglect the result is that mani young
women who feel lone and desir to get marri overstep the limit
of prudenc on receipt of a promis that thu thei mai attain their
end with the result that gener thei find themselv ruin and
desert
mr bramwel booth said that the armi is do it utmost to mitig
the horror of what is known as the white slave traffic both here and
in mani other countri with thi object it ha a bill befor
parliament at the present time of which on of the aim is to prevent
children from be sent out of thi countri to franc under
circumst that practic ensur their moral destruct it
seem that the state of thing in pari in thi connexion is in her
own word most abomin too horribl for word children ar
procur from certain theatr danc school and their birth
certif sometim falsifi to make it appear that thei ar over
fourteen although often thei mai be as young as twelv or even ten
then thei ar convei to vile place in pari where their doom is
sure
let us hope that in due cours thi bill will becom law for if girl
ar protect up to sixteen in thi countri sure thei should not be
sent out of it in doubt circumst under that ag
needless to sai abomin of thi natur ar not unknown in london
thu a while ago the armi receiv a telegram from a german girl
ask can you help two of it peopl went at onc to the address
given and contriv to get into the hous discov there a young
woman who imagin that she had been engag in germani as a servant
in an english famili found herself in a london brothel fortun
be a girl of some charact and resourc she held her own and
have heard of the salvat armi in her own land persuad a
milkman to take the telegram that brought about her deliveri from thi
den of wicked
unfortun it prove imposs to discov the woman who had hire
her abroad as the victim of the plot realli knew noth about that
procuress thi girl wa restor to her home in germani none the
wors for her terrif adventur and a few week later refund her
travel expens but how mani must there be who have never heard
of the salvat armi and can find no milkman to help them out of
their vile prison for such place ar no less
anoth branch of the armi women work is that of the rescu of
prostitut from the street which is known as the midnight work
for the purpos of thi endeavour it hire a flat in great titchfield
street of which and of the mission that centr round it i will
speak later in thi book
the women social work of the salvat armi began in london in the
year 1884 at the cottag of a womansoldi of the armi who live in
whitechapel thi ladi who wa interest in girl without charact
took some of them into her home eventu she left the place which
came into the hand of the armi whereon mr bramwel booth wa sent
to take charg of the twelv inmat whom it would accommod the
seed that wa thu sown in 1884 ha now multipli itself into
fiftynin home and agenc for women in great britain alon to sai
noth of other abroad and in the coloni but thi is onli a
begin
we look forward said mr bramwel booth to me to a great
increas of thi side of our work at home no year ha pass without
the open of a new women home of some kind and we hope that thi
will continu thu i want to build a veri big matern hospit if i
can get the monei we have about 20000 in hand for thi purpos but
the lesser of the two scheme befor us will cost 35000
will not some rich and charit person provid the 15000 that ar
lack
the headquart of the women social work
lower clapton road
the women social headquart of the salvat armi in england is
situat at clapton it is a properti of nearli three acr on which
stand four hous that will be rebuilt whenev fund ar forthcom
for the erect of the matern hospit and train institut
for nurs and midwiv which i have alreadi mention at present
about forti offic ar emploi here most of whom ar women under
the command of commission cox on of the foremost of the 600
womenoffic of the salvat armi in the unit kingdom who give
their servic to the women social work
it is almost needless for me to add that commission cox is a ladi of
veri great abil who is entir devot to the caus to which she
ha dedic her life on of the reason of the great success of the
salvat armi is that onli abl peopl exactli suit to the
particular work in view ar put in author over that work here
there ar no sinecur no bought advowson and no freehold live
moreov the polici of the armi as a gener rule is not to allow
ani on to remain too long in ani on offic lest he or she should
becom fossil or subject to local influenc
i rememb when i wa in america hear of a case in which a veri
lead offic of the armi who chanc to be a near rel of
gener booth declin to obei an order to chang hi command for
anoth in a total differ part of the world the order wa
repeat onc or twice and as often disobei resign follow
and an attempt to found a rival organ i onli mention thi
matter to show that disciplin is enforc in thi societi without
fear favour or prejudic which is perhap a princip reason of
it effici
hillsborough hous inebri home
under the guidanc of commission cox i inspect a number of the
london women institut of the armi first visit the
hillsborough hous inebri home thi home a beautifulli clean
and wellkept place ha accommod for thirti patient
twentynin bed be occupi on the dai of my visit the ladi in
charg inform me that these patient ar expect to contribut 10
per week toward the cost of their mainten but that as a matter
of fact thei seldom pai so much gener the sum recov vari
from 7s to 3s per week while a good mani give noth at all
the work the patient do in thi home is sold and produc someth
toward the cost of upkeep the actual expens of the mainten of
the inmat averag about 12 6d a week per head which sum
includ an allow for rent most of the case stai in the home for
twelv month although some remain for a shorter period when the
cure is complet if thei ar marri the patient return to their
husband the unmarri ar sent out to posit as gover
nurs or servant that is if the author of the home ar abl
to give them satisfactori charact
as the reader who know anyth of such matter will be awar it is
gener suppos to be rather more easi to pass a camel through the
ey of a needl than to reclaim a confirm femal drunkard yet as i
have alreadi said the salvat armi on a three year test in each
case ha shown that it deal successfulli with about 50 per cent of
those women who come into it hand for treatment as inebri or
drugtak how is thi done larg of cours by effect
through religi mean a chang of heart and natur as the armi
often seem to have the power to do and by the exercis of gentl
person influenc
but there remain anoth aid which is physic
with the shrewd that distinguish them the offic of the armi
have discov that the practic of vegetarian is a wonder
enemi to the practic of alcohol the vegetarian it seem
conceiv a bodili distast to spiritu liquor if thei can
persuad a patient to becom a vegetarian then the chanc of her
cure ar enorm increas therefor in thi and in the other
femal inebri home no meat is serv the breakfast which is
eaten at 730 consist of tea brown and white bread and butter
porridg and fresh milk or stew fruit a sampl dinner at on
oclock includ macaroni chees green potato fruit pud or
plain boil pud with stew fig on on dai a week howev
bake or boil fish is serv with peas pud potato and
boil currant pud and on anoth brown gravi is given with
onion in batter tea which is serv at six oclock consiststo
take a coupl of samplesof tea white and brown bread and butter
and chees sandwich with salad or of tea white and brown bread and
butter savouri roll and appl or orang
it will be observ that thi diet is as simpl as it well can be but
i think it right to add after person inspect that the inmat
appear to thrive on it extrem well certainli all whom i saw look
well nourish and healthi
a book is kept in the home in which the detail of each case ar
carefulli enter togeth with it record for two year after
discharg here ar the particular of three case taken by me at
hazard from thi book which will serv to indic the class of
patient that is treat at thi home of cours i omit the name

hope that she will be quit cure
cd ag thirti cd father a farmer wa a moder

the matern nurs home
lorn hous stoke newington
her royal high princ louis the duchess of argyl defrai the
cost of the purchas of the leasehold of thi charm home the
ladyoffic in charg inform me that the object of the
establish is to take in women who have or ar about to have
illegitim children it is not howev a lyingin home the
mother be sent to the ivi hous hospit for their confin
after these ar over thei ar kept for four or sometim for six
month at lorn hous at the expir of thi period situat ar
found for most of them and the babi ar put out to nurs in the
hous of carefulli select women with whom the mother can keep in
touch these women ar visit from time to time by salvat armi
offic who make sure that the infant ar well treat in everi wai
all the case in thi home ar those of girl who have fallen into
troubl for the first time thei belong to a better class than do
those who ar receiv in mani of the armi home the charg for their
mainten is suppos to be 1 a week but some pai onli 5s and
some noth at all as a matter of fact out of the twelv case
which the home will hold at the time of my visit half were make no
payment if the armi averag a contribut of 7s a week from them
it think itself fortun
i saw a number of the babi in cradl place in an old greenhous in
the garden to protect them from the rain that wa fall at the time
when it is at all fine thei ar kept as much as possibl in the open
air and the result seem to justifi thi treatment for it would be
difficult to find healthier infant
five or six of the inmat sleep togeth in a room for those with
children a cot is provid besid each bed i saw sever of these
young women who all seem to be as happi and content as wa
possibl under their somewhat depress circumst
the matern receiv home
brent hous hacknei
thi home serv a somewhat similar purpos as that at lorn hous
but the young women taken in here while await their confin ar
not as a rule of so high a class
in the garden at the back of the hous about forti girl were seat
in a kind of shelter which protect them from the rain some of them
work and some talk togeth while other remain apart
depress and silent most of these young women were shortli expect
to becom mother certain of them howev alreadi had their
infant as there were seventeen babi in the home who had been
crowd out of the central matern hospit among these were some
veri sad case sever of them be girl of gentl birth taken in
here becaus thei could pai noth on i rememb wa a foreign
young ladi whose sad histori i will not relat she wa found run
about the street of a seaport town in a halfcraz condit and
brought to thi place by the offic of the salvat armi
in thi hous there is a room where expati who ar in servic can
bring their infant upon their holidai two or three of these women
were here upon the occas of my visit and it wa a pathet sight
to see them dandl the babi from whom thei had been separ and
give them their food
it is the custom in thi and other salvat armi matern home to
set apart a night in everi month for what is call a social even
on these occas fifti or more of the former inmat will arriv
with their children whom thei have brought from the variou place
where thei ar at nurs and for a few hour enjoi their societi
after which thei take them back to the nurs and return to their
work whatev it mai be by mean of thi kindli arrang these
poor mother ar enabl from time to time to see someth of their
offspr which needless to sai is a boon thei greatli prize
the matern hospit
ivi hous hacknei
thi hospit is on for the accommod of young mother on the
occas of the birth of their illegitim children it is a humbl
build contain twentyf bed although i think a few more can
be arrang that it serv it purpos well until the larg
matern hospit of which i have alreadi spoken can be built is
shown by the fact that 286 babi of whom onli twentyf were not
illegitim were born here in 1900 without the loss of a singl
mother thirti babi di howev which the ladyoffic in charg
thought rather a high proport but on account for by the fact
that dure thi particular year a larg number of the birth were
prematur in 1908 270 children were born of whom twelv di six
of these be prematur
the case ar drawn from london and other town where the salvat
armi is at work gener thei or their rel and friend or
perhap the father of the child appli to the armi to help them in
their troubl therebi no doubt prevent mani childmurd and
some suicid the charg made by the institut for these lyingin
case is in proport to the abil of the patient to pai mani
contribut noth at all from those who do pai the averag sum
receiv is 10 a week in return for which thei ar furnish with
medic attend food nurs and all other thing need to
their state
i went over the hospit and saw these unfortun mother ly in
bed each of them with her infant in a cot besid her although their
immedi trial wa over these poor girl look veri sad
thei know that their live ar spoil said the ladi in charg
most of them were quit young some be onli fifteen and the
major under twenti thi it wa explain to me is gener due
to the ignor of the fact of life in which girl ar kept by their
parent or other respons for their train last year there wa
a mother ag thirteen in thi hospit
on girl who seem particularli sad had twin ly besid her
hope to cheer her up i remark that thei were beauti babi
whereon she hid her face beneath the bedcloth
dont talk about them said the offic draw me awai that
child nearli cri her ey out when she wa told that there were two
you see it is hard enough for these poor mother to keep on but
when it come to two
i ask whether the major of these unfortun young women realli
tri to support their children the answer wa that most of them try
veri hard inde and will us all their monei for thi purpos even
stint themselv of absolut necessari few of them go wrong
again after their first slip as thei have learn their lesson
moreov dure their stai in hospit and afterward the salvat
armi doe it best to impress on them certain moral teach and
thu to make it work prevent as well as remedi
place in servic ar found for a great number of these girl
gener where onli on servant is kept so that thei mai not be
taunt by the other if these should find out their secret thi as a
rule howev is confid to the mistress the averag wage thei
receiv is about 18 a year as it cost them 13 or 5s a week to
support an infant not allow for it cloth the struggl is veri
hard unless the armi can discov the father and make him contribut
toward the support of hi child either voluntarili or through a
bastardi order
i wa inform that mani of these father ar suppos to be
gentlemen but when it come to thi matter of payment thei show that
thei have littl titl to that descript of cours in the case of
men of humbler degre monei is even harder to recov i mai add
that my own long experi as a magistr goe to confirm thi
statement it is extraordinari to what mean subterfug and even
perjuri a man will sometim resort in order to avoid pai so
littl as 1s 6d a week toward the keep of hi own child often
the line of defenc is a cruel attempt to blacken the charact of the
mother even when the accus well know that there is not the
slightest ground for the charg and that he alon is respons for
the woman fall5 also if the case is prove and the order made
mani such men will run awai and hide themselv in anoth part of the
countri to escap the fulfil of their just oblig
in connexion with thi matern hospit the salvat armi ha a
train school for midwiv and nurs all of whom must pass the
central midwiv board examin befor thei ar allow to
practis some of the student after qualifi continu to work for
the armi in it hospit depart and other in the slum
depart while some go abroad in the servic of other societi
the scale of fee for thi four month cours in midwiferi vari
accord to circumst the armi ask the full charg of eighteen
guinea from those student who belong to or propos to serv other
societi those who intend to go abroad to work with medic
missionari have to pai fifteen guinea and those who ar member
of the salvat armi or who intend to serv the armi in thi
depart pai noth unless at the conclus of their cours
thei decid to leav the armi servic
at the last examin out of fourteen student sent up from thi
institut thirteen pass the necessari test
the nest
clapton
when i began to write thi book i determin to set down all thing
exactli as i saw or heard them but although somewhat harden in
such matter by long experi of a veri ugli world i find that
there ar limit to what can be told of such a place as the nest in
page which ar meant for perus by the gener public the hous
itself is charm with a good garden adorn by beauti tree it
ha everi arrang and comfort possibl for the welfar of it
child inmat includ an openair bedroom cleverli contriv from
an old greenhous for the us of those among them whose lung ar
weakli
but these inmat these sixtytwo children whose ag vari from
about four to about sixteen what can i sai of their histori onli
in gener languag that more than on half of them have been subject
to outrag too terribl to repeat often enough at the hand of their
own father if the reader wish to learn more he can appli
confidenti to commission cox or to mr bramwel booth
illustr some of the children at the nest
here howev is a case that i can mention as although it is
dread enough it belong to a differ class see a child of
ten whose name wa betti plai about quit happili with the
other i spoke to her and afterward ask for the particular of
her stori thei were brief it appear that thi poor littl thing had
actual seen her father murder her mother i am glad to be abl to
add that to all appear she ha recov from the shock of thi
aw experi
inde all these littl girl notwithstand their hideou past
seem so far as i could judg to be extrem happi at their
childish game in the garden except that some were of stunt growth
i note noth abnorm about ani of them i wa told howev by
the offic in charg that occasion when thei grow older
propens origin induc in them through no fault of their own
will assert themselv
to lessen thi danger as in the case of the women inebri all
these children ar brought up as vegetarian befor me as i write
is the bill of fare for the week which i tore off a notic board in
the hous the breakfast on three dai to take exampl consist of
porridg with boil milk and sugar cocoa brown and white bread
and butter on the other morn either stew fig prune or
marmalad ar ad a sampl dinner consist of lentil savouri bake
potato brown gravi and bread boil rice with milk and sugar for
tea banana appl orang nut jam brown and white bread and
butter and cocoa ar suppli but tea itself as a beverag is onli
given on sundai a footnot to the bill of fare state that all
children over twelv year of ag who wish for it can have bread and
butter befor go to bed
certainli the inmat of the nest if ani judgment mai be form
from their person appear afford a good argument to the
advoc of vegetarian
it cost 13 a year to endow a bed in thi institut amongst
other i saw on which wa label the band of helper bed thi
is maintain by girl who have pass through the institut and
ar now earn their livelihood in the world as i thought a
touch and signific testimoni i should add that the children in
thi home ar educ under the direct of a certif
gover
my visit to thi refug made a deep impress on my mind no person
of sens and experi rememb the nameless outrag to which
mani of these poor children have been expos could wit their
present health and happi without realiz the bless natur of
thi work
the train institut for women social worker
clapton
colonel lambert the ladyoffic in charg of thi institut
inform me that it can accommod sixti young women at the time of
my visit fortyseven pupil were be prepar for servic in the
women depart of what is call salvat armi warfar these
cadet come from all sourc and in variou wai most of them have
first been member of the armi and made applic to be train
feel themselv attract to thi particular branch of it work
the basi of their instruct is religi and theolog it
includ the studi of the bibl of the doctrin and disciplin of the
salvat armi and the rule and regul govern the labour of
it social offic in addit these cadet attend practic
class where thei learn needlework the scientif cut out of
garment knit laundri work first medic aid nurs and so
forth the cours at thi institut take ten month to complet
after which those cadet who have pass the examin ar
appoint to variou centr of the armi social activ
when these young women have pass out and enter on activ social work
thei ar allow their board and lodg and a small salari to pai for
their cloth thi salari at the commenc of a worker career
amount to the magnific sum of 4s a week if she live in about
the pai of a countri kitchen maid out of which she is expect to
defrai the cost of her uniform and other cloth postag stamp etc
ultim after mani year of servic it mai rise to as much as
10 in the case of senior offic or if the offic find her own
board and lodg to a limit of 1 a week
of these ladi who ar train in the home few leav the armi should
thei do so howev i am inform that thei can gener obtain from
other organ doubl or trebl the pai which the armi is abl to
afford
thi train institut is a build admir suit to the
purpos to which it is put origin it wa a ladi school which
wa purchas by the salvat armi the diningroom of the cadet wa
veri well arrang and charmingli decor with flower as wa that
of the offic beyond there wa also a cadet retiringroom where
i saw some of them read or otherwis amus themselv on their
saturdai halfholidai the armi would be glad to find and train more
of these selfsacrif worker but the condit of the pai which
thei can offer and the arduou natur of the lifelong servic
involv ar such that those of a satisfactori class ar not too
readili forthcom
attach to thi train institut is a home for girl of doubt
or bad anteced which i also visit thi rescu home is link
up with the train school so that the cadet mai have the
opportun of acquir a practic knowledg of the class of work
upon which thei ar to be engag in afterlif most of the girl in
the rescu home have pass through the policecourt and been hand
over to the care of the armi by magistr the object of the armi is
to reform them and instruct them in us work which will enabl them
to earn an honest live
mani of these girl have been in the habit of thiev from their
mistress or other gener in order to enabl them to make
present to their lover inde it would seem that thi mania for
make present is a frequent caus of the fall of young person with
a natur lean to dishonesti and a desir to appear rich and
liber the armi succe in reclaim a great number of them but
the thiev instinct is on not easi to erad
all these girl seem fairli happi a great deal of knit is done
by them and i saw a room furnish with a number of knit
machin where work is turn out to the valu of nearli 25 a week
also i wa shown pile of women and children undercloth and
other articl the produc of the girl needl which ar sold to
help to defrai the expens of the home in the workroom on thi
saturdai afternoon a number of the young women were engag in mend
their own garment after their period of probat mani of these
girl ar sent out to situat found for them by the armi
the women industri home
hacknei
thi home is on of much the same class as that which i have just
describ it ha accommod for fortyeight girl of whom over
1000 have pass through the institut where thei ar gener
kept for a period of six month most of the young women in the home
when i visit it had been thiev on who wa twentyseven year of
ag had stolen ever sinc she wa twelv and the ladi in charg told
me that when she came to them everyth she had on her and almost
all the articl in her trunk were the properti of former mistress
in answer to my question commission cox inform me that the
result of their work in thi home wa so satisfactori that thei
scarc like to announc it thei comput howev that taken on a
three year testfor the subsequ career of each inmat is
follow for that period90 per cent of the case prove to be
perman moral cure thi when the previou histori of these young
women is consid mai i think be account a great triumph no
monei contribut is ask or expect in thi particular home
inde it would not be forthcom from the class of girl who ar
sent or come here to be reform mani of whom on enter ar
destitut of undercloth and other necessari the needlework which
thei do howev is sold and help to pai for the upkeep of the
place
i ask what wa done if ani of them refus to work the answer wa
that thi veri rare happen as the womenoffic share in their
labour and the girl could not for shame sake sit idl while their
offic work i visit the room where thi sew wa in progress
and observ that commission cox who conduct me wa receiv
with hearti and to all appear spontan clap of hand
which seem to indic that these poor young women ar happi and
content the hour of labour kept in the home ar those laid down in
the factori act
while look at the work produc by the inmat i ask
commission cox if she had anyth to sai as to the charg of
sweat which ar sometim brought against the armi and of
undersel in the market her answer wa
we do not compet in the market at all as we do not make suffici
articl and never work for the trade or suppli wholesal we sell
the garment we make on by on by mean of our pedlar it is
necessari that we should do thi in order to support our girl either
we must manufactur and sell the work or thei must starv
here we have the whole charg of sweat by the armi in a nutshel
and the answer to it
in thi home a system ha been devis for provid each girl with an
outfit when she leav it is manag by mean of a kind of defer
pai which is increas if she keep up to the standard of work
requir thu gradual she earn her outfit and leav the place
with a box of good cloth the first thing provid is a pair of
boot then a suitabl box and lastli the materi which thei make
into cloth
thi hous like all the other i found to be extrem well
arrang with properlyventil dormitori and well suit to it
purpos
the inebri home
springfield lodg denmark hill
thi hous which ha a fine garden attach wa a gentleman
resid purchas by the salvat armi to serv as an inebri
home for the better class of patient with the except of a few who
give their servic in connexion with the work of the place as a
return for their treatment it is realli a home for gentlefolk when i
visit it some of the inmat of whom there ar usual from
twentyf to thirti were talent ladi who could speak sever
languag or paint or plai veri well all these came here to be
cure of the drink or drug habit the fee for the cours rang from a
guinea to 10 per week accord to the abil of the patient to
pai but some who lack thi abil pai noth at all
the ladi in charg remark drili on thi point that mani peopl
seem to think that as the place belong to the salvat armi it
did not matter if thei paid or not as is the practic at hillsborough
hous a vegetarian diet is insist upon as a condit of
the patient receiv treatment at the home often thi is a caus of
much remonstr as the inmat who ar mostli person in middl or
advanc life think that it will kill them the actual result
howev ar found to be most satisfactori as the percentag of
success is found to be 50 per cent after a year in the home and
three year subsequ supervis i wa told that a while ago sir
thoma barlow the wellknown physician challeng thi statement he
wa ask to see for himself he examin a number of the patient
inspect the book and record and final satisfi himself that it
wa absolut correct
the armi attach much import to what mai be call the aftercar
of the case for the lack of which so mani peopl who pass through
home and then return to ordinari life break down and becom
perhap wors than thei were befor the seven devil of scriptur
ar alwai readi to reoccupi the swept and garnish soul especi
if thei be the devil of drink
moreov the experi of the armi is that rel and friend ar
extraordinarili thoughtless in thi matter often enough thei will as
it were thrust spiritu liquor down the throat of the
newlyreform drunkard or at the least will pass them befor their
ey and drink them in their presenc as usual with result that mai
be imagin on tast and in four case out of six the thing is done
the old long awak again and must be satisfi
for these reason the highlyskil offic of the salvat armi
hold that reclaim inebri should be safeguard watch and so
far as the circumst mai allow kept under the influenc that
have brought about their partial recoveri thei sai that thei ow much
of their remark success in those case to a strict observ of
such prevent method for a period of three year after that time
patient must stand upon their own feet these remark appli also to
the victim of the drug habit who ar even more difficult to deal
with than common drunkard
at thi home i had a convers with a fine young woman an
exhospit nurs who gave me a veri interest account of her
experi of laudanum drink she said that in an ill she had
gone through while she wa a nurs a doctor dose her with laudanum to
deaden her pain and induc sleep the upshot wa that she could not
sleep without the help of laudanum or other opiat and thu the
fatal habit wa form she describ the effect of the drug upon
her which appear to be temporari exhilar and freedom from all
care coupl with sensat of great vigour she spoke also of
delight vision but when i ask her to describ the vision she
went back upon that statement perhap becaus their natur wa such
as she did not care to set out she ad howev that the sleep
which follow wa haunt by terribl dream
anoth effect of the habit accord to thi ladi is forget
which show itself in all kind of mistak and in the loss of power
of accur express which caus her to sai thing she did not
mean and could not rememb when she had said them she told me that
the process of wean herself from the drug wa extrem pain and
difficult but that she now slept well and desir it no more
to be plain i wa not satisfi with the truth of thi last
statement for there wa a strang look in her ey which suggest
that she still desir it veri much also she seem to me to
prevar upon certain point further those in charg of her
allow that thi diagnosi wa probabl correct especi as she is
now in the home for the second time although her first visit there
wa a veri short on still thei thought that she would be cure in
the end let us hope that thei were right
the armi ha also anoth home in thi neighbourhood run on similar
line for the treatment of middleclass and poor peopl
the women industri home
southwood sydenham hill
thi is anoth of the salvat armi home for women when i visit
southwood which is an extrem good hous have been a gentleman
resid with a garden and command a beauti view there were
about forti inmat some of whom were person of gentl birth for
such ladi singl sleep place ar provid with special dine
and sittingroom these ar suppos to pai a guinea a week for their
board and accommod though i gather that thi sum wa not
alwai forthcom the major of the other inmat most of whom
have gone astrai in on wai or anoth pai noth
a good mani of the case here ar what ar call prevent that is
to sai that their parent or guardian be abl to do noth with
them and fear lest thei should come to ruin send them to thi
place as a last resourc hope that thei mai be cure of their evil
tendenc
thu on girl whom i think i saw could not be prevent from gad
on the street and therefor had been place here anoth young
woman wa a schoolmistress who would not get out of bed and refus to
work when she came to the home she wa veri insol and
badtemp and would do noth now i wa inform she rise
with the lark at 630 inde and work like a trojan i could not
help wonder whether these excel habit would surviv her
departur from the home anoth ladi who had been sentenc for
theft wa the daughter of a minist she horrifi the offic by
regret that she had gone to jail for so littl when other who
had taken and enjoi larg sum receiv practic the same
sentenc she wa report to be do well
anoth also a ladi wa the victim of an infatu which caus
her to possess herself of monei to send to some man who had follow
her about from the time she wa in a board school anoth wa a
foreign who had been sent to an american doctor in the east to be
train as a nurs thi poor girl underw an aw experi and
wa in the care of the salvat armi recov from shock but of
cours her is a differ class of case from those which i have
mention abov anoth wa an english girl who had been turn out
of canada becaus of her bad behaviour with men and so on
it onli remain to sai that most of these peopl appear to be do
well while mani of those in the humbler class of life were be
taught to earn their own live in the laundri that is attach to the
institut
the women shelter
whitechapel
thi is a place where women most of them old so far as my
observ went ar taken in to sleep at a charg of 3d a night
it us to be 2d until the london counti council made the provis
of sheet etc compulsori when the armi wa oblig to rais the
payment thi shelter which is almost alwai so full that peopl have
to be turn awai hold 261 women it contain a separ room where
children ar admit with their mother half price name
112d be charg per child there is a kitchen attach where
the inmat can bui a larg mug of tea for a 12d and a huge chunk
of bread for a second 12d also if i rememb right other
articl of food if thei can afford such luxuri
the great dormitori in thi shelter it mai be mention wa onc a
swimmingbath some of the women who come to thi place have slept in
it almost everi night for eighteen or twenti year other make us of
it for a few month and then vanish for a period especi in the
summer when thei go hop or strawberri pick and return in the
winter everi dai howev fresh peopl appear possibl to depart on
the morrow and be seen no more
i ask whether the ag folk had not been benefit by the old ag
pension act the ladi offic in charg repli that it had been a
bless to some of them on old woman howev would not appli for
her pension although she wa urg to take a room for herself
somewher she said that she wa afraid if she did so she might be
turn out and be lone
i visit thi shelter in the late afternoon befor it wa fill up
a number of dilapid and antiqu femal were sit about in the
room talk or sew on old ladi wa do crochet work she
told me that she made her live by it and by flowersel anoth
inform me that it wa year sinc she had slept anywher els and
that she did not know what poor women like her would do without thi
place anoth wa cook the broth her husband wa a sea captain
and when he di her father had allow her 1 a week until he
di afterward she took to drink and drift here where i wa
inform she is do well and so on and so on ad infinitum the
hanburi street women shelter is not a cheer spot to visit on a
dull and raini even
the slum settlement
hacknei road
slum work is an import branch of the social labour of the
salvat armi thu last year the slum sister visit over 105000
famili over 20000 sick and over 32000 publichous in which
work thei spent more than 90000 hour of time also thei attend 482
birth and paid nearli 9000 visit in connexion with them
there ar nine slum settlement and post in london and nineteen
other in england scotland and ireland the old system us to be
for the sister and nurs to live among the lowest class of the poor
lodg in the actual tenement in which their work wa carri out
thi howev wa abandon as far as possibl becaus it wa found
that after the arduou toil of the dai these ladi could get littl
rest at night ow to the nois that went on about them a
circumst that caus their health to suffer and made them
ineffici now out of the 117 offic engag in slum work in great
britain about onehalf who labour in london live in five hous set
apart for them in differ quarter of the citi fifteen offic
be the usual complement to each hous
the particular dwell of which i write is a good specimen of them
all and from it the sister and nurs who live there work
shoreditch bethnal green whitechapel and the hoxton and hacknei
road district it is decent furnish and a comfort place in
it wai although of cours it stand in a poor neighbourhood i
rememb that there wa even the finish touch of a canari in the
window i should add that no case ar attend in the hous itself
which is pure a resid
to thi particular settlement two qualifi midwiv and a nurs ar
attach while i wa there on of the midwiv came in veri tire
at about halfpast eleven in the morn sinc three oclock on that
same morn she had attend three confin so no wonder she wa
tire she said that on of her case wa utterli unprovid with
anyth need as the father wa out of work although on the
occas of a previou confin thei had all thei want now thei
live in a littl room in which there wa not space to swing a cat
and were without a singl bite of food or bit of cloth so that the
babi when it came had to be wrap up in an old shawl and the woman
sent to the infirmari the sister in charg inform me that if thei
had them thei could find employ for twice their strength of nurs
without overlap the work of ani other chariti
the peopl with whom thei deal ar for the most part those who have a
root object to infirmari although the hospit ar much more
us than wa formerli the case the system of the armi is to make a
charg of 6s 6d for attend a confin which if paid is
gener collect in instal of 3d or 6d a week often
howev it is not paid and the charg remain a mere formal she
ad that mani of these poor peopl ar most improvid and make no
provis whatsoev for these event even if thei can afford to do
so the result is that the armi ha to lend them babi garment and
other thing
the sister said in answer to my question that there wa a great deal
of poverti in their district where mani men were out of work a number
of them becaus thei could find noth to do she thought that thing
were certainli no better in thi respect inde the state of
depress wa chronic ow to the bad summer of 1909 which
affect the hoppick and other busi the destitut that
year wa as great dure the warm month as it usual is in the
winter
the poor of thi district she said gener live upon fri fish
and chip you know thei cannot cook anywai thei dont and what thei
do cook is all done in the fryingpan which is also a veri conveni
articl to pawn thei dont understand economi for when thei have a
bit of monei thei will bui in food and have a big feast not think
of the dai when there will be littl or noth then again thei
bui their good in small portion for instanc their coal by the
haporth or their wood by the farthingsworth which in fact work
out at a great profit to the dealer or thei bui a farthingsworth
of tea which is boil up again and again till it is awfullook
stuff
i ask her what she consid to be the main underli caus of
thi miseri she answer that she thought it wa due to the peopl
flock from the countri to the citi therebi confirm an opinion
that i have long held and advanc she ad that the overcrowd in
the district wa terribl the regul of the public health
author design to check it be a dead letter in on case
with which she had to do a father mother and nine children live in
a room that measur 9 ft by 9 ft and the babi came into the world
with the children look on
the gener weekli rent for a room contain a famili is 5s or if
it is furnish 7s 6d the sister describ to me the furnitur
of on for the us of which thi extra halfcrown is charg it
consist of a ricketi bed two chair on without a back and on
without a seat and a littl shaki tabl the floor wa bare and she
estim the total valu of these articl at about their weekli rent
of 2s 6d if inde thei were worth carri awai in thi
chamber dwelt a coachman who wa out of place hi wife and three or
four children i wonder what arrang these poor folk make as to
the us of the on chair that ha a bottom to occupi the other must
be an empti honour with refer to thi man the sister remark
that as a result of the introduct of motor vehicl busmen
cabmen and blacksmith were join the rank of her melancholi
clientel in number
thi and some similar stori caus me to reflect on the remark
contrast between rent in the countri and in town for instanc i own
about a dozen cottag in thi villag in which i write and the
highest rent that i receiv is 2s 5d a week thi is paid for a
larg doubl dwell on which i had to spend over 100 quit
recent to convert two cottag into on also there is a larg
doubl garden thrown in so larg that a man can scarc manag it in
hi spare time a pigsti fruit tree etc all thi for 1d a week
less than is charg for the two broken chair the ricketi bed and
the shaki tabl again for 10 a year i let a comfort farmhous
that is 3 a year less than the outofwork coachman pai for hi
singl room without the furnitur and yet as the sister said peopl
continu to rush from the countri to the town
nor it seem do thei alwai make the best of thing when thei get
there thu the sister mention that the educ which the girl
receiv in the school caus them to desir a more exalt lot in
life than that of a servant so thei try to find place in shop or
jam factori etc some get them but mani fail and of those who
fail a larg proport go to swell the mass of the unemploi or to
recruit the rank of an undesir profess she went so far as to
sai that most of the domest servant in london ar not cocknei at
all but come from the countri ad that the sad part of it wa
that thousand of these poor girl after proper train could find
comfort and remun employ without displac other as
the demand for domest servant is much greater than the suppli
these ar cold fact which seem to suggest that our system of free
educ is capabl of improv
it appear that all thi district is a great centr of what is known
as sweat thu artifici flower of which i wa shown a fine
specimen a marguerit ar made at a price of 1s per gross the
worker suppli their own glue an expert hand begin at eight
in the morn and continu till ten at night can produc a gross
and a half of these flower and thu net 1s 6d minu the cost
of the glue scissor and sundri the offic of the armi find it
extrem difficult to talk to these poor peopl who ar invari
too busi to listen therefor some of them have learnt how to make
artifici flower themselv so that when thei call thei can join in
the famili manufactur and while do so carri on their
convers
for the make of matchbox and the stick on of the label the
pai is 212d per gross few of us i think would care to
manufactur 144 matchbox for 212d i learn that it is not
unusu to find littl children of four year of ag help their
mother to make these box
the slum sister attach to the settlement who ar distinct from the
matern nurs visit the veri poorest and worst neighbourhood for
the purpos of help the sick and afflict and incident of
clean their home also thei find out person who ar about
sixtynin year of ag and contribut to their mainten so as to
save them from be forc to receiv poorlaw relief which would
prevent them from obtain their oldag pension when thei come to
seventi
here is an illustr of the sort of case with which these slum
sister have to deal perhap i should sai the easiest sort of case
an old man and hi wife whom thei visit live in a clean room the
old woman fell sick and befor she di the slum sister gave her a
bath which as these poor peopl much object to wash caus all
the neighbour to sai that thei had kill her after hi wife
death the husband who earn hi live by sell lace on london
bridg went down in the world and hi room becam filthi the slum
sister told him that thei would clean up the place but he forbad
them to touch the bed which he said wa full of mice and beetl
as he knew that women dread mice and beetl he thought that thi
statement would frighten them when he wa out sell hi lace thei
descend upon hi room where the first thing that thei did wa to
remov the said bed into the yard and burn it replac it with
anoth on hi return the old man exclaim oh my darl
whatev have you been do
thei still clean thi room onc a week
the gener impress left upon my mind after visit thi place at
hacknei road and convers with it guardian angel is that in some
of it aspect if not in all civil is a failur probabl
thought peopl made the same remark in ancient rome and in everi
other citi sinc citi were the truth is that so soon as it
children desert the land which bore them for the town these horror
follow as sure as the night follow the dai
the piccadilli midnight work
great tichfield street
i visit thi place a littl befor twelv oclock on a summer night
it is a small flat near oxford street in which live two
womenoffic of the armi who ar engag in the work of reclaim
prostitut i mai mention that for the last fourteen year the major
in charg night by night ha tramp the street with thi object
the titchfield street flat is not in ani sens a home but i saw a
small room in it with two bed where case who mai be rescu from
the street or come here in a time of troubl can sleep until
arrang ar made for them to proce to on of the rescu
institut of the armi
thi work is on of the most difficult and compar unproduct
of ani that the armi undertak the career of these unfortun
street women who ar nearli all of them veri fine specimen of femal
human for the most part follow a rocketlik curv the major
of them begin by get into troubl at the end of which perhap
thei find themselv with a child upon their hand or thei mai have
been turn out of their home or some sudden misfortun mai have
reduc them to destitut at ani rate the result is that thei take
to a loos life and mayhap after live under the protect of on
or two men find themselv upon the street sometim it mai be
said to their credit if that word can be us in thi connexion thei
adopt thi mode of life in order to support their child or children
the major inform me that if thei ar handsom thei gener begin
with a period of great prosper on whom she knew earn about 30
a week and a good mani of them make as much as 1000 a year and pai
perhap 6 weekli in rent
a certain proport of them ar care open a bank account save
monei retir and get marri gener these keep their bankbook
in their stock which in their peculiar mode of life thei find
to be the safest place as thei ar veri suspici of each other and
much afraid of be rob the major of them howev ar not so
provid thei live in and for the moment and spend their illgotten
gain as fast as thei receiv them
gradual thei drift downward thei begin in piccadilli and
progress or rather retrogress through leicest squar on to
tottenham court road and oxford street and thenc to the euston road
end their sad career in bishopsg and whitechapel the major
inform me that there ar but veri few in the piccadilli
neighbourhood whom she knew when she took up thi work and that as a
rule thei cannot stand the life for long the irregular hour the
exposur the excit and abov all the drink in which most of
them indulg kill them out or send them to a poorhous or the
hospit
she said howev that as a class thei have mani virtu for
instanc thei ar veri kindheart and will alwai help each other
in troubl also most of them have affect for their children
be care to keep them if possibl from ani knowledg of their
mode of life further thei ar charit to the poor and in a wai
religi or perhap superstiti would be a better term thu
thei often go to church on sundai and do not follow their avoc
on sundai night on new year ev their practic is to attend the
watch night servic where doubtless poor peopl thei make those
good resolut that form the proverbi pavement of the road to
hell nearli all of them drink more or less as thei sai that thei
could not live their life without stimul moreov their
profess necessit their walk some mile everi night
for the most part these women lodg in pair in their own flat where
thei pai about 35 a week for three unfurnish room the offic
told me that often some despic man who is call a bulli live
on them follow them round the street and watch them even the
smartest girl ar not infrequ the victim of such a man who
knock them about and take monei from them occasion he mai be a
husband or a rel she ad that as a class thei ar much better
behav and less noisi than thei us to be thi improv
howev is larg due to the increas strict of the polic
these women do not decreas in number in the major opinion there
ar as mani or more of them on the street as there were fourteen
year ago although the brothel and the procuress ar less
numer and their quarter have shift from piccadilli to other
neighbourhood
the armi method of deal or rather of attempt to deal with thi
utterli insolubl problem ar simpl enough the offic walk the
street everi night from about twelv to two and distribut card in
three languag accord to the nation of the girl to whom these
ar offer here thei ar in english french and german

the woman who take the card mai come to great titchfield street and
be rescu in due cours more frequent howev she will give a
fals address or make an appoint which she doe not keep or will
sai that it is too late for her to chang her life but thi fact doe
not alwai prevent such a woman from try to help other by send
young girl who have recent taken to the trade to the titchfield
street refug in the hope that thei mai be induc to abandon their
evil cours
occasion the armi ha midnight supper in it regent hall for
these women who attend in larg number perhap out of curios at
the last supper nearli 300 swell girl were present and listen to
the prayer and the exhort to amend their live sometim too
the offic attend them when thei ar sick or dy onc thei buri
on of the women who di whilst under their care hold a midnight
funer over her at their hall in oxford street
it wa attend by hundr of the sisterhood and the major describ
the scene as terribl the women were seiz with hyster and burst
into shriek and sob thei even tri to open the coffin in order to
kiss the dead girl who lai within
amongst mani other case i wa inform of a black girl call
diamond so name becaus she wore real diamond on her dress which
dress cost over 100 apiec the armi tri to help her in vain and
wrote her mani letter in the end she di in an infirmari when all
the letter were found carefulli hidden awai among her belong and
return to the major
the averag number of rescu compass directli or indirectli by
the piccadilli midnight work is about fifti a year thi is not a veri
great result but after all the take of even a few peopl from thi
hellish life and their restor to decenc and selfrespect is well
worth the cost and labour of the mission the offic told me that
thei meet with but littl success in the case of those women who ar
in their bloom and earn great incom it can scarc be
otherwis for what ha the armi to offer them in place of their
gaudi glitter life of luxuri and excit
the wai of transgressor is hard but the wai of repent is harder
at ani rate while the transgressor is do well on the on hand
jewel and champagn fur and motor and on the other prayer that
talk of death and judgment plain garment made by the wearer
labour and at the end the drudgeri of earn an honest livelihood
perhap as a servant human natur be what it is it seem scarc
wonder that these children of pleasur cling to the path of rose
and turn from that of thorn
with those that ar grow old and find themselv broken in bodi and
in spirit who ar thrust asid in the fierc competit of their
trade in favour of younger rival those who find the wine in their
tinsel cup turn or turn to gall the case is differ thei
ar sometim not alwai glad to creep to such shelter from the
storm of life as the armi can offer and there work out their moral
and physic salvat for what bitter is there like to that
which must be endur by the poor broken woman of the street as
scorn spat on thrust asid she sink from depth to depth into the
last depth of all strive to drown her miseri with drug or drink
if so she mai win forget even for an hour

their grain from night to night that at length thei mai garner into

it wa a strang scene the air wa hot and heavi the sky wa fill
with black and lower cloud alreadi lace with lightn the

while watch all these sight we lost touch of the salvat armi
ladi who worm their wai through the crowd as easili and quickli

the antisuicid bureau
thi is a branch of the armi work with which i have been more or

like a cur you f have been afflict with great sorrow well
those sorrow have some purpos and some mean there alwai a
dawn beyond the night wait for that dawn it will come here or
hereaft
and so on and on through all the gamut of human sin and miseri
of cours there ar case in which the armi fail as i have said
there were about a dozen of these last year six of which if i
rememb right occur with startl rapid on after the other
the suicid offic of the armi alwai take up the daili paper with
fear and trembl and not infrequ find that the man whom thei
thought thei had consol and set upon a differ path ha been
discov dead by drown in the river or by poison in the street
or by whatev it mai be but everyth ha it proport of
failur and where intend suicid ar concern 1 or 2 per cent
or on the quarter basi that i have adopt as beyond question of
sincer of intent 4 or 8 per cent is not a larg averag inde
20 per cent would not be larg or even 50 per cent but these figur
do not occur
of cours it is suggest that mani of those who drift into the
antisuicid bureau have no real intent of make awai with
themselv but that thei come there onli to see what thei can get in
the wai of monei or other comfort as regard monei the answer is
that except veri occasion the armi give none for the simpl
reason that it ha none to give for the rest the fatal case which
happen show that there is a grim purpos at work in the mind of mani
of the applic but i repeat let us halv the figur let us even
quarter them which as euclid remark is absurd and even then what
ar we to conclud
befor proceed with my comment upon thi work i ought to state
perhap that the armi ha variou branch of thi antisuicid
crusad thu it is at work in almost all our big citi and also in
america in australia and in japan the japanes bureau wa open
last year with veri good result thi is the more remark in a
countri where ancient tradit and immemori custom hallow the
system of harakiri in ani case of troubl or disgrac
moreov the idea is spread count tolstoi is said to have been
interest in it applic have been receiv from the hagu for
particular of the armi method in the matter similar work is be
carri out in vienna not by the armi but on it line the armi ha
been inform that if it will open an antisuicid bureau in budapest
offic accommod etc will be found for it and so forth
colonel unsworth who until recent had charg of the antisuicid
bureau from it commenc is of opinion that suicid is veri much
on the increas a statement that it would be difficult to disput in
view of the number of case record daili in the local press for
instanc i read on on thi morn of write in a norfolk paper
where a farmer had blown out hi brain to all appear becaus he
had a differ of opinion with hi wife as to whether he should or
should not take on anoth farm
colonel unsworth attribut thi sad state of affair to sundri
caus the first of these wa the intens and everincreas nervou
pressur of our time the second the spread of fatal the third
the advanc of materialist idea and of the gener disbelief in
the doctrin of futur retribut the fourth a certain notic
return in such matter to the standard of pagan nation especi of
ancient rome where it wa held that if thing went wrong and life
becam valueless or even uninterest to bring it to an end wa in
no sens shame but praiseworthi in illustr of thi point he
quot a remark said to have been made by a magistr not long ago
to the effect that in certain condit a man wa not to be blame
for take hi own life
hi fifth reason wa that circumst aris in which some peopl
convinc themselv that their death would benefit their famili
thu insur mai fall in for after on or two premium have been
paid mani offic take the risk of suicid or thei mai know that
when thei ar gone wealthi rel will take care of their
children who will thu be happier and better off than these ar while
thei the father live wrong as it mai be thi inde is an
attitud with which it is difficult not to feel a certain sympathi
after all we ar told that there is no greater love than that of a
man who lai down hi life for hi friend though there ran be no
doubt that the sai wa not intend to includ thi kind of lai
down of life
colonel unsworth sixth caus wa the increas atrophi of the
public conscienc he state that suicid is rare preach against
from the pulpit as drunken is for instanc further a juri can
seldom be induc to bring in a verdict of felodes even where
the victim wa obvious and perhap painfulli sane hi act is put
down to temporari insan
other caus ar drink hereditari disposit mad in all it
protean shape incur diseas unwilling to face the
consequ of sin or folli the passion of sexual love which is
sometim so mighti as to amount to mad the effect of utter
grief such as result from the loss of those far more belov than
self of which an instanc is at hand in the case of the offic in
charg of the shelter at great peter street westminst mention
earlier in thi book who it mai be rememb tri to kill himself
after the death of hi wife and child and lastli where women ar
concern terror and shame at the prospect of give birth to a
child whose appear in the world is not sanction by law or
custom
suicid among women is howev compar rare a fact which
suggest either that the caus which produc it press on or affect
them less or that in thi particular their mind ar better balanc
than ar those of men i wa told at ani rate that but few women
appli to the suicid bureau of the armi for help in thi temptat
though perhap that mai be due to the greater secret of the
sex
speak gener thi magnitud of the evil to be attack mai be
gaug from the fact that about 3800 peopl die by their own hand in
england and wale everi year a somewhat appal total
intend suicid come into the hand of the armi bureau in variou
wai some of them see notic in the press descript of thi branch
of the social work some of them ar found by policemen in desper
circumst and brought to the bureau and some ar sent there from
differ local by salvat armi offic
i have look through the record of number of these case but for
obviou reason it is difficult to give a full and accur
descript of ani of them the reader therefor must be content to
accept my assur of their genuin natur on or two howev mai
be allud to with becom vagu here is an exampl of a not
infrequ kind when a person arriv at the offic have alreadi
attempt the deed
a busi man who had recent made a studi of agnost literatur
had becom involv in certain complic which result in a
quarrel with hi wife hi mean not be suffici to the support
of a doubl establish he took the train to london with a bottl
of sulphon in hi pocket not a drug to be recommend for hi
purpos and swallow tabloid all the wai to town when he had taken
seventyf grain and the bottl as i saw wa twothird empti
he found that the drug work in a wai he did not expect instead of
kill him it awok hi religi suscept which the cours
of agnost literatur had scotch but not kill and he began to
wonder with some earnest whether after all there might not be a
hereaft which in the circumst he did not care to face
in thi acut perplex he bethought him of the salvat armi and
arriv at the bureau in a state of consider excit as
quickli as a taxicab could bring him a doctor and a fortnight in
hospit did the rest the armi found him anoth situat in place
of the on which he had lost and compos hi differ with hi
wife thei ar now both salvationist and veri happi so in thi
instanc all well that end well
case twoa man in a respons posit and of rather
extravag habit marri a wife of more extravag habit and
found that whatev the proverb mai sai it cost more to keep two
than on hi monei matter becam desper involv but be
afraid to confid in hi wife he spent a sundai afternoon in try
to make up hi mind whether he would shoot or drown himself while he
wa thu engag a salvat armi band happen to pass hi door and
remind him of what he had read about the antisuicid bureau
postpon decis as to the exact method of hi departur from thi
earth he call there and wa persuad to make a clean breast of
the matter to hi wife
afterward the armi took up hi extrem complic affair i saw a
pile of document relat to them that must have been at least 4 in
thick the variou moneylend were interview and persuad to
accept payment in weekli or monthli instal the account wa
almost squar when i saw it and the person concern extrem happi
and grate i should sai that in thi case a lawyer bill for the
work which wa done for noth would have amount to quit 50
in anoth somewhat similar case that of an offici who had tamper
with monei in hi charg though thi wa not discov some of the
creditor had place the busi in the hand of
debtcollectingag than whom said colonel unsworth there ar
no harder or more cruel creditor at ani rate thei drove thi poor
man almost to mad with the usual result a friend brought him to
the armi who shoulder hi affair dealt with the debtcollect
agenc obtain help from hi connexion and paid off what wa
ow by instal he and hi famili ar now again quit
comfort
illustr at on of the armi food depot
case threea man wa curs with such a fear temper that he
could keep no situat he came to london in a state of furi with a
razor in hi pocket happen to see the word salvat armi
shelter on a build it occur to him to hear what the suicid
offic had to sai befor he cut hi throat thei dealt with the
matter and show him the error of hi wai he is now in a veri good
singlehand situat abroad where as he cannot talk the languag
he find it difficult to quarrel with those about him
case fourtelephon oper who wa driven mad by that dread
instrument and by domest worri the armi offic save the man
and smooth over the domest worri but how he get on with the
telephon instrument is not record
case fiveunsuit marriag and bad temper the wife had becom
involv in some troubl in earli life and unwis as it prove
confess to the husband who brought it up against her everi time
there wa a quarrel between them in thi instanc also suicid wa
avert and the domest differ were arrang
case sixa man in a busi firm marri with children wa
through no fault of hi own thrown out of work ow to the
appoint of a new manag he came at last to the embank and
afterward appli for a job in answer to an advertis the
advertis told him it wa a piti that as he had been so near the
river he did not go into it the man determin to commit suicid but
the offic dissuad him from thi cours and help him he
return a year later in a condit of consider prosper
have work hi wai to a coloni where he is now do extrem
well hi visit to england be in connexion with the busi in
which he had becom a partner
and so on ad infinitum i might tell mani such stori some of them
of a much more tragic charact than those i have instanc but
refrain from do so lest by chanc thei should be identifi
especi where the individu concern belong to the upper
strata of societi perhap enough ha been said howev to show what
a great work is be done by the armi in thi depart where in
london alon it deal with sever wouldb suicid everi dai
of cours some of these peopl ar fraud for instanc on of the
offic told me that not long ago a medic man who wa evid a
drunkard call on him and said that he would commit suicid unless
monei were given to him he wa inform that thi wa against the
rule whereon the man produc a bottl and said that if the monei
were not forthcom he would drink it content and make an end of
himself in the offic as mai be imagin the offic went through an
anxiou moment not quit know what to do howev he look the
man over sum him up to the best of hi judgment and abil and
come to the conclus that he wa a bulli and a braggart said that
he might do what he like the man swallow the content of the
bottl exclaim that he would be dead in a few minut and a paus
ensu dure which the offic confess to me that he felt veri
uncomfort the end of it wa that hi visitor said with a laugh
that he would not like to cumber the salvat armi with hi corps
and walk out of the room the draught which he had taken wa
compar harmless
as i have mention howev a proport of the case ar quit
irreclaim thei come and consult the armi then depart and do the
deed six that can be trace have been lost in thi wai dure the
last few month
colonel unsworth explain to me what i had alreadi guess that thi
busi of deal with score and hundr of despair be
stand on the veri edg of the grave is a terribl strain upon ani
man the respons becom too great and he who ha to bear it
is apt to be crush beneath it weight everi morn he read hi
paper with a sensat of nervou dread fear lest among the polic
new he should find a brief account of the discoveri of some corps
which he can identifi as that of an individu with whom he had
plead at hi offic on the yesterdai and in vain
on former occas when i visit him colonel unsworth us to show
me a small museum of poison knive revolv etc which he had
taken from those who propos to us them to cut the gordian knot of
life
now howev he ha but few of these dread relic i ask him
what he had done with the rest he answer that he had destroi
them
the truth is he ad that after some year of thi busi i
can no longer bear to look at the horrid thing thei get upon my
nerv
if i mai ventur to offer a word of advic to the chief of the
salvat armi i would suggest that the veri respons posit of
first antisuicid offic in london is not on that ani man should be
ask to fill in perpetu
work in the provinc
liverpool
when plan thi littl book i had it in my mind to deal at some
length with the provinci social work of the armi now i find
howev that consider of space must be taken into account also
that it is not need to set out all the detail of that work see
that to do so would involv a great deal of repetit
the salvat armi machin for the regener of fallen men and
women if i mai so describ them ar after all of much the same
design and vari for the most part onli in the matter of size the
materi that goe through those machin is it is true differ
yet even it infinit varieti if consid in the mass ha a
certain similitud for these reason therefor i will onli speak of
what is done by the armi in three of the great midland and northern
citi that i have visit name manchest liverpool and
glasgow and of that but briefli although my note concern it run
to over 100 type page
the ladi in charg of the slum settlement in liverpool inform me
that the poverti in that citi is veri great and dure the past
winter of 1919 wa realli terribl ow to the scarc of work in
the dock the poor howev ar not so overcrowd and rent ar
cheaper than in london the cost of two dwellingcellar be about
2s 6d and of a room about 3s a week the sisterhood of
fallen women is she ad veri larg in liverpool but most of these
belong to a low class
in thi citi the armi ha on institut for women call the ann
fowler memori home which differ a good deal from the major of
those that i have seen it is a lodginghom for women and is
design for the accommod of person of a better class than those
who gener frequent such place thi build which wa provid
in memori of her mother by miss fowler a local philanthropist at a
cost of about 6000 wa origin a welsh congreg chapel
that ha been alter to suit the purpos to which it is now put it
is extrem well fittedup with separ cubicl made of oak
panel good lavatori accommod and kitchen in which is made
some of the most excel soup that i ever tast
yet strang to sai thi place is not as much appreci as it might
be as mai be judg from the fact that although it is design to
hold 113 lodger when i visit it there were not more than between
forti and fifti thi is remark as the charg made is onli 4d
per night or 2s a week even for a cubicl and an excel
breakfast of bread and butter fish and tea can be had for 2d
other meal ar suppli on a like scale with the result that a woman
emploi in outsid work can live in consider comfort in a room or
cubicl of her own for about 8s a week
the ladi in charg told me howev that there ar reason for thi
state of affair on is that it provid for peopl of a rather
higher class than usual who of cours ar not so numer as those
lower in the social scale
the princip reason howev is prejudic it is known that most of
the women accommod in the armi shelter ar what ar known as
fallen or drunk therefor occup of a home devot to a
higher section of societi fear lest thei should be tar with the
same brush in the ey of their associ
here is a stori which illustr thi point which i rememb hear
in the unit state a woman whose inebrieti wa well known wa
pick up absolut dead drunk in an american citi and taken by an
offic of the armi to on of it home and put to bed in the morn
she awok and guess where she wa lodg from variou sign and
token such as text upon the wall began to scream for her cloth
an attend who thought that she had develop delirium tremen ran
up and ask what wa the matter
matter ejacul the sot the matter is that if i dont get out
of thi place in doubl quick time i shall lose my charact
the women who avail themselv of thi ann fowler home ar of all
ag and in variou employ on i wa told wa a ladi separ
from her husband whose father now dead had been the mayor of a
larg citi
a liverpool institut of anoth class known as the holli is
an industri home for fallen women drunkard thiev and
incorrig girl it hold thirtyeight inmat and is alwai full
a good mani of these be sent to the place from policecourt whenc
thei ar discharg under the first offend act
i saw these women at their even prayer the sing wa hearti and
spontan and thei all seem happi enough still the face of
most of them thei vari in ag from fortysix to sixteen show
trace of life troubl but on or two were evid person of
some refin their histori which would fill volum must be
omit suffic it to sai that thi home like all the other is
extrem wellarrang and manag and is do a most excel and
success work
when the women ar believ to be cure of their evil habit whatev
thei mai be thei ar for the most part sent out to servic there ar
two room in the place to which thei can return dure their holidai
or when thei ar chang situat at a charg of 5s a week thi
mani of them like to do
next door to the holli is anoth home where young girl with
their illegitim babi and also a few children ar accommod
it is arrang to hold twentyfour mother and is gener full a
charg of 5s a week is suppos to be made but unless the case ar
sent from the workhous when the guardian pai in practic littl is
recov from the patient when thei ar well again their babi
ar put out to nurs as at the london matern home and the girl
ar sent to servic no difficulti be experienc in find them
place dure the two year that thi home had been open eightytwo
girl had pass through it and of these the matron inform me
there were but ten who were not do so well as thei might the rest
were in employ of on sort or anoth and seem to be in the wai
of complet regain their charact
i visit thi place late at night and in the room devot to
children as distinct from infant saw on girl of nine with a
curiou histori thi child had been twelv time in the hand of the
polic befor her father brought her to the armi on their suggest
her mania wa to run awai from home where it doe not appear that she
wa illtreat and to sleep in the street on on occas for as
long as five night thi child had a veri curiou face and even in
her sleep as i saw her there wa about it someth wild and
defiant when the matron turn her over she did not yawn or cry but
utter a kind of snarl i suppos that here is an instanc of
atav that the child throw back for thousand or ten of thousand
of year to when her progenitor were savag and that their
primit instinct have reassert themselv in her although she
wa born in the twentieth centuri she had been ten month in the home
and wa do well inde the matron told me that thei had taken her
out and given her opportun of run awai but that she had
never attempt to avail herself of them
the offic in charg inform me that there is much need for a
matern hospit in liverpool
there ar also institut for men in liverpool but these i must
pass over
the men social work
manchest
the offic in charg of the men social work in manchest told me
the same stori that i had heard in liverpool as to the prevail
distress he said it ha been terribl the last few winter i have
never seen anyth like it we know becaus thei come to us and the
troubl is more in a fix point than in london number and number
come destitut of shelter or food or anyth the caus is want of
employ there is no work mani case of cours go down through
drink but the most cannot get work the fact is that there ar more
men than there is work for them to do and thi i mai sai is a regular
thing winter and summer
a sad statement sure and on that excit thought
i ask what becam of thi residu who could not find work hi
answer wa thei wander about die off and so on
a still sadder statement i think
the major in charg is a man of great organis abil forc of
charact and abound human sympathi yet he wa onc on of the
melancholi armi of waster some seventeen year ago he came into the
armi through on of it shelter a drunken outofplac
cabinetmak who had been tramp the street thei gave him work
and he got convert now he is the head of the manchest social
institut engag in find work for or convert thousand of
other
at first the armi had onli on establish in manchest which us
to be a cotton mill now it is a shelter for 200 men then it took
other some of which ar own and some hire among them a great
elev on the london plan where wast paper is sort and sold
the turnov here wa over 8000 in 1909 and mai rise to 12000 i
forget how mani men it find work for but everi week some twentyf
new hand come in and about the same number pass out
thi is a wonder place fill with what appear to be rubbish but
which is realli valuabl materi among thi rubbish all sort of
strang thing ar to be found thu i pick out of it and kept as a
souvenir a beautifullybound copi of weslei hymn publish about
a hundr year ago ly near it wa an earli edit of scott
marmion thi elev more than pai it wai inde the armi is
save monei out of it which is put by to purchas other build
then there ar hous where the peopl emploi in the paperwork
lodg a recentlyacquir home for the better class of men which wa
onc a mansion of the de clifford famili and afterward a hospit
and a store where everi kind of oddment is sold by dutch auction
these articl ar given to the armi and among the week collect
i saw clock furnitur bicycl a parrot cage and a crutch not
long ago the manag of thi store had a goat present to them
which nearli at them out of hous and home as no on would bui it
and thei did not like to send the poor beast to the butcher
in these variou shelter and institut i saw some strang
charact on had been an electr engin educ under
professor owen at cardiff colleg he came into monei and gambl
awai 13000 on horserac although he told me that he won as much
as 8000 on on ascot meet hi subsequ histori is a stori in
itself on too long to set out but the end of it in hi own word
wa four year ago i came here and thank god i am go on all
right
why do not the writer of naturalist novel studi salvat armi
shelter in ani on of them thei would find more materi than could
be us up in ten lifetim though person i confess i am
content to read such stori in the secret annal of the variou
institut
anoth man a veri pleasant and humor person who wa onc a
church worker and a singer in the choir etc when in hi own word
he us to put on religion with hi sundai cloth and take it off
again with them came to grief through sheer love of amus such
as that which is to be found in musichal and theatr hi habit
wa to spend the monei of an insur compani by which he wa
emploi in take out the young ladi to whom he wa engag to such
entertain ultim of cours he wa found out and when
starv on the road determin to commit suicid the salvationist
found him in the nick of time and now he is foreman of their
papercollect yard
anoth at the ripe ag of twentyfour had been twentyseven time
in prison hi father wa in prison hi eldest brother commit
suicid in prison by throw himself over the banist also he had
two brother at present undergo penal servitud who when he wa a
littl fellow us to pass him through window to open door in
hous which thei were burgl
i suggest that it wa a poor game and that he had better give it up
he answeredi shall never do it again sir god help me
realli i think he meant what he said
anoth in the chepstow street shelter where he act as
nightwatchman wa discharg from portland after serv a fifteen
year sentenc for manslaught hi troubl wa that he kill a man
in a fight and as he had fought him befor and had a grudg against
him wa veri nearli hang for hi pain thi man earn 9 in some
wai or other dure hi sentenc which he sent to hi wife
afterward he discov that she had been live with anoth man
who di and left her well off but she ha never refund the 9 nor
will she have anyth to do with her husband
oakhil hous
manchest
oakhil hous is a rescu home for women which wa given to the armi
by mr crosslei a wellknown local ladi it deal with prison
fallen inebri and prevent case at the time of my visit there
were sixtythre inmat but when a new adjac build is
complet there will be room for more there is a wonder laundri in
thi home where the most beauti wash is done at extrem
moder price the iron and starch room wa a busi sight but
what i chiefli rememb about it wa the spectacl of on melancholi
old man the onli male among that crowd of women seat by a
steamboil that drove the machineri to which it wa hi busi to
attend no woman can be persuad to look after a boiler in the
midst of all those femal he had the appear of a superannu
and disillus turk contempl hi too extens establish
and reflect on it monthli bill
the matron in charg inform me that even for these rough women there
is no system of punish whatsoev no girl is ever restrict in
her food or put on bread and water or struck or shut awai by
herself the armi maxim is that it is it mission not to punish but to
try to reform if in ani particular case it method of gentl
fail which thei rare do it is consid best that the case should
depart veri possibl to return again later on
she ad that although mani of these women had commit assault
and even fought the polic not on of them attack anoth in the
home onc in a year and that dure her twenti year of work
although she had live among some of the worst women in england she
had never receiv a singl blow as an illustr of what the
salvat armi understand by thi word work i mai state that
throughout these twenti year except for the allot annual
fortnight thi ladi ha had no furlough
the men social work
glasgow
i saw the brigadi in charg of the men social work in glasgow at a
great central institut where hundr of poor peopl sleep everi
night the inscript paint on the window give a good idea of it
charact here ar some of them cheap bed cheap food wast
paper collect miss friend found salvat for all
in addit to thi refug there is an elev of the usual type
in which about eighti men were at work and an establish call
the dale hous home a veri beauti adam hous let to the armi at
a small rent by an ey hospit that no longer requir it thi hous
accommod ninetyseven of the men who work in the elev
the brigadi inform me that the distress at glasgow wa veri great
last year inde dure that year of 1909 the armi fed about 35000
men at the dock and 65000 at the refug a chariti which caus
them to be offici recogn for the first time by the
corpor that sent them a chequ in aid of their work now
howev thing have much improv ow to the build of
menofwar and the forg of great gun for the navi at parkhead
forg alon 8000 men ar be emploi upon a vessel of the
dreadnought class which will occupi them for a year and a half so it
would seem that these monster of destruct have their peac
us
glasgow he said is a terribl place for drink especi of
methyl spirit and whiski drink at the begin i need hardli
remark mean destitut at the end so doubtless thi fail
account for a larg proport of it poverti
the men social work of the armi in glasgow which is it
headquart in scotland is spread in everi direct not onli in
that citi itself but beyond it to paislei greenock and edinburgh
inde the brigadi ha order to get into dunde and aberdeen as
soon as possibl i ask him how he would provid the monei he
answer well by trust in god and keep our powder dry
as regard the armi local financ the troubl is that ow to the
nation thrifti it is harder to make commerci ventur pai in
scotland than in england thu i wa inform that in glasgow the
corpor collect and sell it own wast paper which mean that
there is less of that materi left for the salvat armi to deal
with in england so far as i am awar the wastepap busi is
not a form of municip trade that the corpor of great citi
undertak
anoth lead branch of the salvat armi effort in scotland is it
prison work it is regist in that countri as a prison aid
societi and the door of everi jail in the land ar open to it
offic i saw the armi prison book in which ar enter the
detail of each prison case with which it is deal aw enough
some of them were
i rememb two that caught my ey as i turn it page the first wa
that of a man who had gone for a walk with hi wife from whom he wa
separ cut her head off and thrown it into a field the second
wa that of anoth man or brute beast who had taken hi child by
the heel and dash out it brain against the fireplac it mai be
wonder why these gentl creatur still adorn the world the
explan seem to be that in scotland there is a great horror of
capit punish which is but rare inflict
my recollect is that the offic who visit them had hope of the
perman reform of both these men or at ani rate that there
were note in hi book to thi effect
i saw mani extraordinari case in thi glasgow refug some of whom
had come there through sheer misfortun on had been a medic man
who unfortun wa left monei and took to specul on the
stock exchang he wa a veri larg holder of share in a south
african mine which he bought at 1s 6d these share now stand at 7
but unhappili for him hi broker dissolv partnership and neither
of them would carri over hi account so it wa close down just at
the wrong time with the result that he lost everyth and final
came to the street he never drank or did anyth wrong it wa as
he said simpli a matter of sheer bad luck
anoth wa a glasgow silk merchant who made a bad debt of 3000
that swamp him afterward he becam paralys but recov he
had been three year cashier of thi shelter
anoth arriv at the shelter in such a state that the offic in
charg told me he wa oblig to throw hi macintosh round him to hide
hi naked he wa an engin who took a publichous and help
himself freeli to hi stockintrad with the result that he becam a
fright drunkard and lost 1700 he inform me that he us to
consum no less than four bottl of whiski a dai and suffer from
delirium tremen sever time in the shelteri quot hi own
wordsi gave my heart to god and after that all desir for drink
and wrongdo he had not been immacul in other wai gradual
left me from 1892 i had been a drunkard after my convers in less
than three week i ceas to have ani desir for drink
thi man becam nightwatchman in the shelter a posit which he
held for twelv month he said i wa promot to be sergeant when
i put on my uniform and stripe i reckon myself a man again then i
wa made foreman of the work at greendyk street then i wa sent to
pioneer our work in paislei and when that wa nice start i wa
sent on to greenock where i am now try to work up a salvat
armi busi
here for a reason to be explain present i will quot a veri
similar case which i saw at the armi coloni at hadleigh in essex
thi man also a scotsman no englishman i think could have surviv
such experi is a person of fine and impos appear great
bodili strength and good address he is about fifti year of ag and
ha been a soldier and after leav the servic a garden inde
he is now or wa recent foreman marketgarden at hadleigh he
marri a hospit nurs and found out some year after marriag that
she wa in the habit of us drug thi habit he contract also
either dure her life or after her death and with it that of drink
hi custom wa to drink till he wa a wreck and then take drug
either by the mouth or subcutan to steadi himself chloroform
and ether he mix togeth and drank strychnin he inject at the
begin of thi cours threepennyworth of laudanum would suffic
him for three dose at the end three year later not to mention
ether chloroform and strychnin he took of laudanum alon nearli a
tablespoon ten or twelv time a dai a quantiti i understand
which is enough to kill five or six hors on of the result wa
that when he had to be oper on for some maladi it wa found
imposs to bring him under the influenc of the anaesthet all
that could be done wa to depriv him of hi power of movement in
which state he had to bear the dread pain of the oper
afterward the surgeon ask him if he were a drugtak and he told
me that he answer
why sir i could have drunk all the lot you have been try to give
me without ever know the differ
in thi condit when he wa such a wreck that he trembl from head
to foot and wa contempl suicid he came into the hand of the
armi and wa sent down to the hadleigh farm
now come the point of the stori at hadleigh he got convert and
from that hour ha never touch either drink or drug moreov he
assur me solemnli that he could go into a chemist shop or a bar
with monei in hi pocket without feel the slightest desir to
indulg in such stimul he said that after hi convers he had
a terribl fight with hi old habit the physic result of their
discontinu be most pain subsequ howev and by
degre the crave left him entir i ask him to what he
attribut thi extraordinari cure he repli
to the power of god if i trust in my own strength i should
certainli fail but the power of god keep me from be overcom
now these ar onli two out of a number of case that i have seen
myself in which a similar explan of hi cure ha been given to
me by the person cure and i would like to ask the unprejud and
openmind reader how he explain them person i cannot explain
them except upon an hypothesi which as a practic person i confess
i hesit to adopt i mean that of a direct interposit from abov
or of the work of someth so unrecogn or so undefin in the
natur of man which it will be rememb the old egyptian a veri
wise peopl divid into mani compon part whereof we have now
lost count that it mai be design an innat superior power or
principl brought into action by faith or suggest
that these peopl who have been the slave of or possess by certain
gross and palpabl vice of which drink is onli on ar truli and
total chang there can be no question to that i am abl to bear
wit the demoniac of new testament histori cannot have been more
transform and i know of no stranger experi than to listen to
such men as i have time and again speak of their past selv as
entiti cast off and gone and of their present selv as new
creatur it is inde on that throw a fresh light upon certain
difficult passag in the epistl of st paul and even upon the
darker sai of the master of mankind himself thei do in truth
seem to have been born again but thi is a line of thought that i
will not attempt to follow it li outsid my sphere and the scope of
these page
after the offic who us to consum four bottl of whiski a dai
and is now in charg of the salvat armi work in greenock had left
the room i propound these problem to lieutcolonel jolliff and
the brigadi as i had done previous to commission sturgess i
point out that religi convers seem to me to be a spiritu
process wherea the crave for drink or ani other carnal
satisfact wa or appear to be a physic weak of the bodi
therefor i did not understand how the spiritu convers could
suddenli and perman affect or remov the physic desir unless
it were by the action of the phenomenon call miracl which mankind
admit doubtfulli to have been possibl in the dim period of the birth
of a religion but for the most part deni to be possibl in these
latter dai
quit so answer the colonel calmli in almost the same word
that commission sturgess had us it is miracl that is our
belief these men cannot chang and purifi themselv their vice ar
instantan perman and miracul remov by the power
and the grace of god thi is the truth and noth more wonder
can be conceiv
here without further comment i leav thi deepli interest matter
to the consider of abler and better instruct person than
myself
to come to someth more mundan which also deserv consider
i wa inform that in glasgow with a popul of about 900000
there exist a float class of 80000 peopl who live in
lodginghous of the same sort as and mostli inferior to the
salvat armi shelter of which i am now write in other word out
of everi twelv inhabit of thi great citi on is driven to that
method of obtain a place to sleep in at night
in thi particular refug there is what is call a free shelter room
where peopl ar accommod in winter who have not even the few
copper necessari to pai for a bed dure the month befor my visit
which took place in the summertim the brigadi had allot free
bed in thi room to destitut person to the valu of 13 i mai add
that twice a week thi particular place is wash with a carbol
mixtur
the ardenshaw women home
glasgow
i visit two of the salvat armi women institut in glasgow
the first of these wa a women rescu home known as ardenshaw thi
is a veri good hous substanti built and well fit up that
befor it wa bought by the armi wa the resid of a glasgow
merchant it ha accommod for thirtysix and is alwai full the
inmat ar of all kind prison case prevent case fallen
case drink case the veri worst of all these class howev ar
not taken in here but sent to the refug in high street ardenshaw
resembl other home of the same sort that i have alreadi dealt with
in variou citi so i need not describ it here
it offic visit the prison at duke street glasgow ayr and
greenock and i saw a letter which had just arriv from the chaplain
of on of these jail ask the matron to interest herself in the
case of a girl come up for trial and to take her into a home if she
were discharg as a first offend
while i wa eat some lunch in thi hous i notic a young woman in
salvat armi dress come up the step with a child of particularli
charm appear at my request she wa brought into the room
where i extract from her a stori which seem to be worth repeat
as an illustr of the spirit which anim so mani member of the
armi
the young woman herself had onc been an invalid who wa taken into
the home and nurs till she recov after which she wa sent to a
situat in a larg town here she came in contact with a poor famili
in which the mother is a drunkard and the father a respect
hardwork man and took a great fanci to on of the children the
littl girl i have mention thi child who is about five year of
ag it is her habit to suppli with cloth and more or less to feed
unfortun howev when the mother is on the drink she pawn the
cloth which my salvat armi friend is oblig to redeem sinc if
she doe not littl bessi is left almost nake inde befor
bessi wa brought awai upon thi particular visit her protectress had
to pai 14 to recov her garment from the pawnshop a
consider sum out of a wage of about 18 a year
i ask her why she did not take awai thi veri fascin child
altogeth and arrang for her to enter on of the armi home she
answer becaus although the mother would be glad enough to let her
go the father who is natur fond of hi children object
of which the result mai be remark lieutcolonel jolliff grimli
that about a dozen year henc that sweet littl girl will becom a
streetwalk drunkard
not while i live broke in her fostermoth indignantli
thi kindheart littl woman told me she had been six year in
servic as sole maidofallwork in a larg hous i inquir whether
it wa a hard place she repli that it would be easier if her four
mistress who ar sister and old maiden ladi did not all take
their meal at four differ time have four differ teapot
insist upon their wash be sent to four differ laundri
emploi four differ doctor and sleep in four differ room
howev she ad it is not so difficult as it wa as there us
to be five but on ha di also thei ar kind to me in other wai
and about bessi thei like me to come here for my holidai as then
thei know i shall return on the right dai and at the right hour
when she had left the room have in mind the capac of the
averag servant and the outcri she is apt to make about her
particular work i said that it seem strang that on young woman
could fulfil all these multifari duti satisfactorili
oh said the matteroffact colonel you see she belong to the
salvat armi and look at thing from the point of view of her
duti and not from that of her comfort
it is curiou at what a tender ag children learn to note the habit
of those about them when thi littl bessi wa given 2d she
lisp out in her pretti scotch accent mother winna have thi for
beer
the women lodginghous
glasgow
the last place that i visit in glasgow wa the shelter for women an
institut of the same sort as the shelter for men it is a
lodginghous in which women can have a bed at the price of 4d per
night but if that sum is not forthcom thei ar not as a rule
turn awai if thei ar known to be destitut
the class of peopl who frequent thi home is a veri low on for the
most part thei ar drunkard thei must leav the shelter befor ten
oclock in the morn when the major of them go out hawk
sell lace or other odd and end some of them earn as much as
2s a dai but as a rule thei spend a good deal of what thei earn
onli save enough to pai for their night lodg thi place ha
been open for sixteen year and contain 133 bed which ar almost
alwai full
the women whom i saw at thi shelter were a veri roughlook set
nearli all elderli and as their filthi garment and mar
counten show often the victim of drink still thei have good
in them for the ladi in charg assur me that thei ar gener to
each other if on of the compani ha noth thei will collect the
price of her bed or her food between them and even pai her debt if
these ar not too larg there were sever children in the place for
each woman is allow to bring in on when i wa there mani of the
inmat were cook their meal on the common stove and veri curiou
and unappet these were
among them i note a darkei lassi of about sixteen who wa cry
draw her asid i question her it seem that her father a
drunken fellow had turn her out of her home that afternoon becaus
she had forgotten to give him a messag have nowher to go she
wander about the street until she met a woman who told her of thi
lodginghous she ad touchingli enough that it wa not her
mother fault
imagin a girl of sixteen thrown out to spend the night upon the
street of glasgow
on the wall of on of the room i saw a notic that read oddli in a
shelter for women it ran
smoke is strictli prohibit after retir
the land and industri coloni
hadleigh essex
the hadleigh coloni of which lieutcolonel lauri is the offic in
charg is an estat of about 3000 acr which wa purchas by the
salvat armi in the year 1891 at a cost of about 20 the acr the
land be stiff clai of the usual essex type as it ha chanc
ow to the amount of build which is go on in the neighbourhood
of southend and to it proxim to london that is within forti
mile the invest ha prove a veri good on i imagin that if
ever it should come to the hammer the hadleigh coloni would fetch a
great deal more than 20 the acr independ of it cultur
improv these of cours ar veri great for instanc more
than 100 acr ar now plant with fruittre in full bear also
there ar brickfield which ar furnish with the best machineri and
plant rang of tomato and salad hous and a larg french garden
where earli veget ar grown for market a portion of the land
howev still remain in the hand of tenant with whom the armi
doe not like to interfer
the total turnov of the land in hand amount to the larg sum of
over 30000 per annum and the total capit invest is in the
neighbourhood of 110000 of thi great sum about 78000 is the cost
of the land and the build the brickwork and other industri
account for 12000 while the remain 20000 repres the valu
of the live and dead stock i believ that the mortgag remain on
the place which the armi had not fund to pai for outright is now
less than 50000 borrow at about 4 per cent and needless to sai
it is well secur
lieutcolonel lauri inform me on the occas of my last visit to
hadleigh in juli 1910 that taken as a whole even now the farm doe
not pai it way6 thi result is entir ow to the charact of
the labour emploi at first sight as the men ar paid but a
trifl sum in cash it would appear that thi labour must be
extrem cheap investig howev give the stori anoth
colour
it cost the armi 10 a week to keep a man at hadleigh in food and
lodg and in addit he receiv a cash grant of from 6d to
5s a week
care observ show that the labour of three of these men of
whom 92 per cent be it rememb come to the coloni through their
drink habit is about equal to that of on good agricultur hand
who in norfolk reckon in hi harvest and sundri would
earnlet us sai 18 a week therefor in practic where i as a
farmer pai about 18 or in the case of carter and milkmen nearli
1 the armi pai 2 circumst under which it is inde difficult
to farm remun in england
the object of the hadleigh coloni is to suppli a place where broken
men of bad habit who chanc in most case to have had some connexion
with or like for the land can be reform and ultim sent out
to situat or as emigr to canada about 400 of such men pass
through the coloni each year of these men lieutcolonel lauri
estim that 712 per cent prove absolut failur although he
ad that it is veri veri difficult to determin as to when a man
should be label an absolut failur he mai leav us an appar
failur and still come all right in the end
the rest name 91 per cent or so regain their place as decent and
us member of societi a wonder result which is brought about
by the pressur of disciplin temper with kind and the
influenc of steadi and health work
person of everi class drift to thi coloni thu among the 230
colonist who were train there when i visit it in juli 1910
were two chemist and a journalist while a church of england
clergyman had just left it for canada
as a specimen of the ruck howev i will mention the first
individu to whom i happen to speaka strong young man who wa
weed a bed of onion he told me that he had been a farm labour
in earli life and subsequ for six year a coachman in a
privat liveri stabl in london he lost hi place through drink
becam a wander on the embank wa pick up by the salvat
armi and sent to on of it elev paperwork afterward he
volunt to work on the land at hadleigh where he had then been
emploi for nine month hi ambit wa to emigr to canada
which doubtless he ha now done or is about to do such case might
be duplic by the dozen but for thi there is no need ex uno
disc omn
all the labour emploi howev is not of thi class for instanc
the next man to whom i spoke who wa engag in plough up old
cabbag land with a pair of veri us fouryearold bred on the
farm wa not a colonist but an agricultur hand paid at the rate of
wage usual in the district anoth who manag the tomatohous
wa a skill profession tomatogrow from the channel island the
experi of the manag of the coloni is that it is necessari to
emploi a certain number of expert agriculturalist on the place in
order that thei mai train the raw hand who come from london and
elsewher
to a farmer such as the present writer a visit to hadleigh is an
extrem interest event show him as it doe what can be done
upon cold and unkindli land by the aid of capit intellig and
labour still i doubt whether a detail descript of all these
agricultur oper fall within the scope of a book such as that
upon which i am engag
therefor i will content myself with sai that thi busi like
everyth els that the armi undertak is carri out with great
thorough and consider success the extens orchard ar
admir manag and were fruit even in the bad season of 1910
the tomatohous which have recent been increas at a capit
cost of about 1000 produc mani ton of tomato and the french
garden is excel of it kind the breed of middlewhit pig is to
be commend so much so in my judgment and i can give no better
testimoni that at the moment of write i am try to obtain from
it a pedigre boar for my own us the hadleigh poultri farm too is
famou all over the world and the offic who manag it wa the
presid for 1910 of the wyandott societi fowl for which hadleigh
is famou have taken the championship prize for thi breed and
other all over the kingdom the cattl and hors ar also good of
their class and the crop in a try year look extrem well
all these thing howev ar but a mean to an end which end is the
redempt of our fallen fellowcreatur or such of them as come
within the reach of the work of the salvat armi at thi particular
place
i should add perhap that there is a citadel or gather hall
which will seat 400 where religi servic ar held and concert
ar given on saturdai night for the amus of the colonist i mai
mention that no pressur is brought to bear to forc ani man in it
charg to conform to the religi principl of the armi inde
mani of these attend the servic at the neighbour parish church
notwithstand the past charact of those who live there
disturb of ani sort ar unknown at hadleigh inde it is
extrem rare for a case origin on the coloni to come befor the
local magistr
the smallhold settlement
boxt essex
gener booth and hi offic ar as i know from variou
convers with them firmli convinc that mani of the great and
patent evil of our civil result from the desert of the land
by it inhabit and that crowd into citi which is on of the
most mark phenomena of our time inde it wa an ident of view
upon thi point which is on that i have advanc for year that
first brought me into contact with the salvat armi but to preach
the advantag of bring peopl back to the land is on thing and
to get them there quit anoth mani obstacl stand in the wai i
need onli mention two of these the necess for larg capit and
the still more import necess of enabl those who ar settl
on it to earn out of mother earth a suffici live for themselv
and their famili
that wellknown philanthropist the late mr her wa anoth
person much impress with the import of thi matter and i
rememb about five year ago dine with him with gener booth as
my fellowguest on an occas when all thi subject wa gone into in
detail so live inde wa mr her interest that he offer
to advanc a sum of 100000 to the armi to be us in an experi
of landsettl carri out under it auspic should that
experi prove success the capit repaid by the tenant wa to
go to king edward hospit fund and should it fail that capit
wa to be written off of thi 100000 40000 ha now been invest
in the boxt ventur and if thi succe i understand that the
balanc will becom avail for other ventur under the provis
of mr her will a long while must elaps howev befor the
result of the experi can be definit ascertain
the boxt settlement is situat in north essex about three mile
from colchest and cover an area of 400 acr it is a flat place
that befor the enclosur act wa a heath with good road frontag
throughout an import point where smallhold ar concern the
soil is a medium loam over gravel neither veri good nor veri bad so
far as my judgment goe and of cours capabl of great improv
under intens cultur
thi estat which altogeth cost about 20 per acr to bui ha
been divid into sixtyseven hold vari in size from 412
acr to 7 acr the cottag which stand upon the hold have been
built in pair at a cost of about 380 per pair which price
includ drainag a drink well and i think a softwat
cistern these ar extrem good dwell and i wa much struck
with their substanti and practic charact thei compris three
bedroom a larg livingroom a parlour and a sculleri contain a
sink and a bath also there is a toolhous a pigsty and a movabl
fowlhous on wheel
on each hold an orchard of fruit tree ha been plant in
readi for the tenant also strawberri currant gooseberri
and raspberri which in all occupi about threequart of an acr
the plan is that the rest of the hold should be cultiv
intens upon a system that is estim to return 20 per acr
the arrang between the armi and it settler is briefli as
follow in everi case the tenant begin without ani capit and is
provid with seed and manur to carri him through the first two
year also with a live allow at the rate of 10 a week for
the man and hi wife and 1s a week for each child which allow
is to ceas after he ha market hi first crop
the tenanc term ar that for two year the settler is a tenant at
will the agreement be termin by either parti at ani time
without compens at the end of these two year subject to the
approv of the director of the settlement the settler can take a 999
year leas of hi hold the armi for obviou reason retain
the freehold after the first year of thi leas the rental payabl
for forti year is to be 5 per cent per annum upon the capit
invest in the settlement of the man and hi famili upon the hold
which rent is to includ the cost of the hous land and
improv and all monei advanc to him dure hi period of
probat
it is estim that thi capit sum will averag 520 per hold
so that the tenant annual rent for forti year will be 26 after
which he will have noth more to pai save a nomin rent and the
remaind of the leas will be the properti of himself or rather of
hi descend thi properti i presum will be saleabl
so put asid all legal technic and complic it come
to thi the tenant is start for two year after which he pai about
4 a year rent per acr for the next forti year and therebi
virtual purchas hi hold the whole question which time alon
can answer is whether a man can earn 4 per acr rent per annum and
in addit provid a live for himself and famili out of a
fiveacr hold on medium land near colchest
the problem is on upon which i cannot ventur to express ani decis
opinion even after mani year of experi of such matter i trust
howev that the answer mai prove to be in the affirm and i am
quit sure that if ani organ is abl to caus it to work out
thi wai that organ is the salvat armi whose brilliant
busi capac can as i know make a commerci success of the
most unpromis materi
i should like to point out that thi ventur is on of great and
almost of nation import becaus if it fail then it will be
practic prove that it is imposs to establish small holder on
the land by artifici mean at ani rate in england and at the
present price of agricultur produc it is not often that a sum of
40000 will be avail for such a purpos and with it the
direct of a charit organ that seek no profit the
oversight of an offic as skill and experienc as lieutcolonel
hiff and in addit a train superintend who will afford
advic as to all agricultur matter a cooper societi readi to
hire out implement hors and cart at cost price and if so
desir to undertak the distribut or market of produc still
notwithstand all these advantag i have my misgiv as to the
ultim result
the men chosen to occupi these hold by a select committe of
salvat armi offic ar for the most part marri peopl who were
born in the countri but had migrat to the town most of them have
more or less kept themselv in touch with countri life by cultiv
allot dure their period of urban resid and preced ha
been given to those who have shown a real desir to return to the
land other essenti ar a good charact both person and as a
worker bodili and mental health and total abstent from ani form
of alcohol no creed test is requir and there ar men of variou
religi faith upon the settlement onli a proport of them be
salvationist
i interview two of these settler at hazard upon their hold
and although the year had been advers found them happi and hope
no 1 who had been a mechan propos to increas hi earn by
mend bicycl no 2 wa an agriculturist pure and simpl and
show me hi fowl and pig with pride here howev i found a
littl rift within the rural lute for on ask him how hi wife
like the life he repli after a littl hesit not veri well
sir you see she ha been accustom to a town
if she continu not to like it veri well there will i think be
an end to that man prospect as a small holder
i had the pleasur of bring present in juli 1910 at the formal
open of the boxt settlement when the salvat armi entertain
sever hundr guest to luncheon mani of them veri wellknown
peopl the dai for a wonder wa fine gener booth spoke for over an
hour in hi most characterist and interest wai the chairman
earl carrington presid of the board of agricultur bless the
undertak offici and privat everybodi seem pleas with
the hold and in short all went merrili as a marriag bell
as i sat and listen howev the queri that aros in my mind
waswhat would be the state of these hold and of the tenant or
of their descend on sai that dai thirti year i trust and hope
that it will be a good state in both instanc but i must confess to
certain doubt and fear
in thi parish of ditchingham where i live there is a man with a few
acr of land an orchard a greenhous etc that man work hi
littl tenanc deal in the surplu produc of larg garden which
he peddl out in the neighbour town and on an averag take
piecework on my farm at the moment of write he and hi son ar
hoe mangold for two or three dai a week at ani rate for a
great part of the year he is a type of what i mai call the natur
small holder and i believ doe fairli well the question is can the
artifici creat small holder who must pai a rent of 4 the acr
attain to a like result
again i sai i hope so most sincer for if not in england back to
the land will prove but an empti catchword at ani rate the countri
should be most grate to the late mr her who provid the
fund for thi intens interest experi and to the salvat
armi which is carri it out in the interest of the landless poor
impress of gener booth
it ha occur to the writer that a few word descript of william
booth the creator and first gener of the salvat armi set down
by a contemporari who ha enjoi a good mani opportun of
observ him dure the past ten year mai possibl have a futur if
not a present valu
of the great of thi man to my mind there can be no doubt when
the point of time whereon we stand and plai our separ part ha
reced and those who follow us look back into the grei mist which
veil the past when that mist ha hidden the glitter of the
decor and deaden the echo of the highsound titl of
todai when our polit tumult our townbr excit and
mani of the veri name that ar household word to us ar forgotten
or discover onli in the page of histori when perhap the
salvat armi itself ha fulfil it mission and gone it road i
am certain that the figur of william booth will abid clearli visibl
in those shadow and that the influenc of hi work will remain if
not still felt at least rememb and honour he will be on of
the few of the veri few endur figur of our dai and even if our
civil should be destin to undergo eclips for a period as
seem possibl when the light return by it he will still be seen
for truli thi work of hi is fine and on that appeal to the
imagin although we ar so near to it that few of us appreci
it real proport also in fact it is the work that should be
admir rather than the man who after all is noth but the
instrument appoint to shape it from the clai of circumst the
clai lai readi to be shape then appear the moulder anim with
will and purpos and work for the work sake to an end which he
could not forese
i have no inform on the point but i should be surpris to learn
that gener booth when provid move him to begin hi labour
among the poor had even an inkl of their futur growth within the
short period of hi own life he sow a seed in faith and hope and
in spite of opposit and poverti in spite of ridicul and of
slander he ha live to see that seed ripen into a marvel
harvest directli or indirectli hundr of thousand of men and
women throughout the world have benefit by hi effort he ha been
a tool of destini like mahomet or napoleon onli in thi case on
fate to help and not to harm mankind such at least is my estim
of him
a littl less of the spirit of selfsacrific a differ sens of
respons and the same strength of imagin and power of
purpos devot to pure materi object might have rais up
anoth multimillionair or a moblead or a selfseek despot
but as it happen some grace wa given to him and the river ha
run anoth wai
opportun too ha plai into hi hand he saw that the
recogn and establish creed scarc touch the great sordid
lust drinksodden povertysteep mass of the citi popul
of the world that thei were wait for a teacher who could speak to
them in a tongu thei understood he spoke and some of them have
listen onli a fraction it is true but still some more as it
chanc he marri a wife who enter into hi thought and wa abl
to help to fulfil hi aspir and from that union were born
descend who for the most part ar fit to carri on hi
labour
further like loyola and other he ha the power of rule be a
born leader of men so that thousand obei hi word without question
in everi corner of the earth although some of these have never seen
hi face lastli natur endow him with a strike presenc that
appeal to the popular mind with a consider gift of speech with
great physic strength and abound energi qualiti which have
enabl him to toil without ceas and to travel far and wide thu
it come about that as truli as ani man of our gener when hi
hour is end he too i believ should be abl to sai with a clear
conscienc i have finish the work that thou gavest me to do
although hi heart mai add i have not finish it as well as i could
wish
now let me try to convei my person impress of thi man i see
him in variou convers with myself when he ha thought that he
could make us of me to serv hi everpres and imperson end
try to add me up wonder how far i wa sincer and to what
extent i might be influenc by privat object then at last
conclud that i wa honest in my own fashion open hi heart
littl by littl and final appeal to me to aid him in hi
labour
i like that man he understand me i onc heard him sai
mention my name and believ that he wa think not speak
i tell thi stori mere to illustr hi habit of reflect aloud
for as he spoke these word i wa stand besid him when i repeat
it to hi offic on of them remark horrifi
good graciou it might just as well have been someth much less
complimentari on never know what he will sai
he is an autocrat whose word is law to thousand had he not been an
autocrat inde the salvat armi would not exist todai for it
sprang from hi brain like minerva from the head of jove and ha been
driven to success by hi singl forc will
yet thi qualiti of master is temper and illumin by an
unfail sens of humour which he is quit readi to exercis at hi
own expens thu a few year ago he and i dine with the late mr
her and as a matter of fact although i had certain thing to
sai on the matter under discuss hi flow of most interest
convers did not allow me over much opportun of sai them it
is hard to compet in word with on who ha preach continu for
fifti year
when gener booth depart to catch a midnight train for the
contin i think mr her went to see him to the door return
present much amus he repeat their part word which were as
follow
gener booth a veri good fellow haggard but a talker you know
her a talker
mr her look at him inde
gener booth laugh ah her you mean that it wa i who
did the talk not haggard well perhap i did
some peopl think that gener booth is conceit
it is a piti that the old gentleman is so vain a highlyplac
person onc said to me
i answer that if he or i had done all that gener booth ha done
we might be pardon a littl vaniti
in truth howev the charg is mistaken for at bottom i believ him
to be a veri humblemind man and on who doe not in the least
overr himself thi mai be gather inde from the tenor of hi
remark on the subject of hi person valu to the armi that i have
record at the begin of thi book
what peopl of slower mind and narrow view mai mistak for pride
in hi case i am sure is but the impati and unconsci
assert of superior power base upon vision and accumul
knowledg also as a gener proposit i believ vaniti to be
almost imposs to such a man so far as my experi of life goe
that scarc creatur the innat as distinguish from the
accident emin man he who is fashion from natur gold not
mere gild by circumst is never vain
such a man know but too well how poor is the fruit of hi supremest
effort how mar by secret weak is what the world call hi
strength and when hi gift ar in the balanc how hard it would be
for ani see judg to distinguish hi success from common failur
it is the littl pinchbeck man whom wealth accid or cheap
clever ha thrust forward who grow vain over triumph that ar
not worth have not the great doer of deed or the seer whose
imagin is wide enough to enabl him to understand hi own utter
insignific in the scale of thing
but to return to gener booth again i hear him explain to me vast
scheme as yet unreal that lurk at the back of hi vivid
practic organ brain scheme for settl ten of thousand of
the citi poor upon unoccupi land in sundri portion of the earth
scheme for great univers or train colleg in which men and
women might be educ to deal with the social problem of our ag on
a scientif basi scheme for obtain govern assist to
enabl the armi to rais up the countless mass of crimin in mani
land take charg of them as thei leav the jail and by
regener their fallen natur save them soul and bodi
in the last interview i had with him i read to him a note i had made
of a convers which had taken place a few dai befor between mr
roosevelt and myself on the subject of the salvat armi here is the
note or part of it
mr roosevelt why not make us of all thi charit energi now
often misdirect for nation end
myself what i have call the wast forc of benevol it is
odd mr roosevelt that we should both have come to that conclus
mr roosevelt ye that the term you see the reason is that we
ar both sensibl men who understand
that is veri import said gener booth when he had heard thi
extract make us of all thi charit energi now often
misdirect for nation end why not inde heaven know it is
often misdirect the salvat armi ha made mistak enough if
onli that could be done it would be a great thing but first we have
got to make other peopl understand besid roosevelt and yourself
that at least wa the sens of hi word
onc more i see him address a crowd meet of citi men in
london on a murki winter afternoon in five minut he ha grip
hi audienc with hi tale of thing that ar new to most of them
quit outsid of their experi he lift a curtain as it were and
show them the aw miseri that li often at their veri offic
door and the duti which is their to aid the fallen and the
suffer it is a long address veri long but none of the hearer
ar weari
at the end of it i had caus to meet him in hi offic about a certain
matter he had strip off hi coat and stood in the red jersei of
hi uniform the perspir still stream from him after the
exert of hi prolong effort in that pack hall as he spoke he
at hi simpl meal of veget mushroom thei were i rememb
and tea for like most of hi famili he never touch meat either
he must see me while he at or not at all and when there is work to
be done gener booth doe not think of conveni or of rest
moreov as usual there wa a train to catch on of hi
peculiar is that he seem alwai to be start for somewher
often at the other side of the world
lastli i see him on on of hi tour he is due to speak in a small
countri town hi offic have arriv to make arrang and ar
wait with the audienc it pour with rain and he is late at
length the motor dash up through the mud and wet and out of the
first of them he appear a tall cloak figur alreadi that dai he
ha address two such meet besid sever roadsid gather
and at night he must speak to a great audienc in a citi fourteen
mile awai also stop at thi place and at that befor he get there
for a like purpos he is to appear in the big citi at eight and
alreadi it is halfpast three
five minut later he ha been assist on to the platform for thi
wa befor hi oper and he wa almost blind and for nearli an
hour pour out a ceaseless flood of eloqu tell the histori of
hi organ tell of hi life work and of hi heart aim
ask for their prayer and help he look a veri old man now much
older than when first i knew him and with hi handsom somewhat
jewish face and long white beard a veri type of some prophet of
israel so abraham must have look on think or jeremiah or
elijah but there is no weari in hi voic or hi gestur and
as he exhort and prai hi darken ey seem to flash
it is over he bid farewel to the audienc that he ha never seen
befor and will never see again invok a fervent bless on them
and present the motor ar rush awai into the wet night bear
with them thi burn fire of a man
such ar some of my impress of william booth gener of the
salvat armi
the chief of the staff
no account of the salvat armi would be complet without some word
about mr bramwel booth gener booth eldest son and righthand
man who in the armi is known as the chief of the staff be
convinc of thi i sought an interview with himth last of the
mani that i have had in connexion with the present work
in the armi mr bramwel booth is gener recogn as the power
behind the throne he it is who seat in hi offic in london
direct the affair and administ the polici of thi vast
organ in all land the care of the countless salvat armi
church is on hi shoulder and ha been for these mani year he
doe not travel outsid europ hi work li chiefli at home i
understand howev that he take hi share in the evangel
labour of the armi and is a power and convinc speaker
although i have never chanc to hear ani of hi address
illustr mr bramwel booth chief of the staff
in appear at hi present ag of someth over fifti he is tall
and not robust with an extrem sympathet face that ha about it
littl of hi father rug cast and stern perhap it is thi
evid sympathi that command the affect of so mani for i have
been told more than onc that he is the best belov man in the armi
and on who never us a stern word
i found him busi and press for time even more so if possibl than
i wa myself he had but just arriv by an earli train from some
provinci citi in fact he wa then engag upon hi annual
visit to all the field offic in the countri which as he
explain take him awai from london for three dai a week for a
period of six week and throw upon him a consider extra strain
of mind and bodi the dioces of the salvat armi is veri extens
i said to mr bramwel booth that i desir from him hi view of the
armi as a religi and a social forc throughout the wide world in
everi land where it set it foot i wish to hear of the work
consid as a whole likewis of that work in it variou aspect
and of the differ race of mankind among which it is carri on
also amongst other i put to him the follow specif question
in what wai and by what mean doe the armi adapt itself to
the need and custom of the variou peopl among whom it
is establish
what is it compar measur of success with each of
these peopl and what futur is anticip for it among
them respect
where is the work advanc where doe it hang in the
balanc and where is it be driven backward
what ar your view upon the futur of the armi as a
religi and social power throughout the world bear in
mind the undoubt difficulti with which it is confront
do you consid that now after fortyf year of
exist it is speak gener on the downward or on
the upward grade
what inform can you give me as to the posit of the
armi in it relat with other religi bodi
at thi point mr bramwel booth inquir mildli how much time i had
to spare the result of my answer wa that we agre togeth that it
wa clearli imposs to deal with all these great matter in an
interview so it wa decid that he should take time to think them
over and should furnish hi repli in the form of a written
memorandum thi he ha done and i mai sai without flatteri that the
paper which he ha drawn up is on of the most clear and broadmind
that i have had the pleasur of read for a long while sinc it is
too long to be us as a quotat i print it in an appendix7
trust sincer that all who ar interest in the salvat armi
in it variou aspect will not neglect it perus inde it is a
valuabl and an authorit document compos by perhap the onli
person in the world who from hi place and inform is equal to
the task
person i ventur upon neither critic nor comment whose rle
throughout all these page is but that of a showman although i trust
on not altogeth devoid of insight into the matter in hand
to onli on point will i call attentionthat of the gener note of
confid which run through mr bramwel booth remark clearli he
at least doe not believ that the salvat armi is in danger of
dissolut like hi father he believ that it will go on from good
to good and from strength to strength
there remain howev on or two other point that we discuss
togeth to which i will allud thu i ask him if he had anyth
to sai as to the attack which from time to time were made upon the
armi he repli as hi father had done noth except that thei
were best left to answer themselv
then our convers turn to the matter of the resign of
certain offic of the armi which had caus some pass public
remark
we have an old sai here he said with some humour that we do
not often lose ani on whom we veri much desir to keep
i point out that i had heard alleg made to the effect that the
armi offic were badli paid hardli treat and when thei prove
of no more us let go to find a live as best thei could
he repli that as to the matter of monei the armi had establish a
pension fund in all the western countri which now amount to a
larg total in thi countri the sum wa about 44000 and dure
1909 about 1800 had been paid here in pension thi howev wa
onli a begin but he thought that the effort wa be made on the
right line and that notwithstand their poverti a realli
adequ pension fund would be built up in due cours
then of a sudden he becam eloqu he said he admit that the armi
had littl to offer those who came into it servic knew that thi
wa so that thei had no hope of tempor reward that thenceforth the
great featur of their life and work wa that it must be fill with
labour and selfdeni the whole busi of help and save our
fellowcreatur wa on of struggl and suffer sacrific wa the
keynot of christian as laid down by it founder those who sought
monei and tempor honour must look elsewher than to the salvat
armi it pride and glori wa that thousand were will to suffer
and deni themselv from year to year and to find their joi and their
recompens in the conscious that thei were do someth
howev littl to lighten the dark and reliev the miseri of the
world
here ar some of hi actual word upon thi matter that i will quot
as i cannot better them
the two fact of real consequ about our offic ar these
first that their number go on increas year by year and second
that thei remain devot to their work veri poor and absolut bent
on obtain a reward in heaven but let me quot here from gener
booth on thi matter
i resolv that no disadvantag as to birth or educ or social
condit should debar ani on from enter the list of combat so
long as he wa on with me in love for god in faith for the salvat
of men and in willing to obei the order he should receiv from
me and from those i author to direct him i have of cours had
mani disappointmentsnot a few of them veri hard to bear at the
timebut from the earli dai of 1868 when i engag my first
recogn helper to 1878 when the number had increas by slow
degre to about 100 and on to the present dai when their number is
rapidli approach 20000 there ha not been a singl year without
it increas not onli in quantiti but in qualiti
i am sometim ask what about those who have left me well i am
thank to sai that we remain in sympathet and friendli relat
with the great bulk of them it wa to be expect that in work such
as our demand as it doe not onli arduou toil and constant
selfdeni and often real hardship of on kind or anoth some
should prove unworthi some should grow weari and other should faint
by the wai whilst other again though veri excel soul should
prove unsuit it could not be otherwis for we ar engag in
real warfar and whoever heard of war without wound and loss but
even of those who do thu step asid from the posit of offic a
larg proportionin thi countri nine out of tenremain with us
engag in some voluntari effort in our rank
but continu mr bramwel booth i would be the last person to
minim our loss thei mai be account for in the most natur
wai and yet we cannot but feel them and suffer from them and yet it
is all just a repetit of the bibl stori of all ag nai of all
stori of genuin fight in ani great caus the great featur of
our present experi in thi matter is that the number who go out
from us grow everi year smaller in proport to the whole and that
as the gener sai in the abov extract a veri larg proport of
those continu in friendli relat with us
the triumph of these splendid men and women in the face of everi
kind of difficulti in everi part of the world is howev realli a
triumph of their faith it is not the armi it is not their leader
it is not even the wonder devot which mani of them manifest
which is the secret of their continu life and continu success nor
is it ani confid in their own abil no the true
repres of the armi is reli at everi turn upon the presenc
guidanc and help of god in try to carri out the father purpos
with respect to everi lost and suffer child of man by that test
alik in the present and futur we must ever stand or fall the armi
is either a work of faith or it is noth at all
everyth throughout all our rank can realli be brought to that
test and i regard with composur everi loss and attack everi puzzl
and danger chiefli becaus i reli upon my comrad trust in god
be respond to by him accord to their need
perhap i mai be allow to add a few remark upon thi subject a
great deal is made of the resign of a few salvat armi offic
in order that thei mai accept excel post in other walk of life
inde it is not uncommon to see it state that such resign
herald the dissolut of the societi inasmuch as the number of the
armi offic is near 20000 it would seem that it can veri well
spare a few of them what fill me with wonder is not that some go
but that so mani remain thi is on of the fact which amongst
much that is discourag convinc me of the innat nobil of man
an old friend of mine of piou disposit onc remark to me that
he could never have been a christian martyr at the first twist of
the cord or the first nip of the redhot pincer he wa sure that
he would have thrown incens by the hand upon the altar of ani
heathen god or goddess that wa fashion at the moment hi spirit
might have been will but hi flesh would certainli have prove
weak
i sympath with the honesti of thi confess and in the same wai
i sympath with those offic of the salvat armi who in race
slang cannot stai the cours
let us consid the lot of these men ani who have enter on even a
secular crusad someth that take them off the beaten offici
path that lead them through the thorn and wilder of a new
untravel countri toward some distant goal seen dimli or not seen
at all except in dream will know what such an undertak mean it
mean snake in the grass it mean savag or in other word veil
and poison hatr and bitter foe or still wors treacher
friend the crusad mai get through in which case no on will thank
him except perhap after he is dead or he mai fail and perish in
which case everi on will mock at him or he mai retreat discourag
and return to the offici road in which case hi friend will remark
that thei ar glad to see that hi insan wa onli of the
intermitt order and that at length he ha learn hi place in the
world and to whom he ought to touch hi cap
well these ar offici road to heaven as well as to the hous of
lord and other mundan goal a fact which the salvat armi offic
and other of hi kind have probabl found out on the offici road
if he ha interest and abilityth first is to be preferredh might
have becom anyth and with ordinari fortun would certainli have
becom someth
but on the path that he ha chosen what is there for him to gain an
inherit of dim glori beyond the star obscur doubtless from
time to time if he is like other men by sudden and sicken
eclips of hi faith and meanwhil the daili round the insol
gibe and the bitter ingratitud of men that leav him griev also
not enough monei to pai for a cab when it is wet and consider
uncertainti as to the futur of hi children and even as to hi own
old ag few comfort for him not even those of a glass of wine to
stimul him or of tobacco to sooth hi nerv for these ar
forbidden to him by the rule of hi order unless he can reach the
veri top of hi particular tree also which it is most unlik that
he will no public recognit even of hi faith strenuou work
and who is there that at heart doe not long for public recognit
in short noth that is desir to man save the conscious of a
virtu which after all he must feel to be indiffer be well
awar of hi own secret fault and the satisfact of have help
a certain number of lame human dog over moral or physic stile
in such a case and in a world which we must admit to be selfish and
imperfect the wonder is not that certain salvat armi offic
be train men of high abil yield to tempt offer and go
but that so mani of them remain
look at my case said on of them to me with my experi and
organ abil i am worth 2000 a year as the manag of ani big
busi and i could have it if i like here i get about 200
thi wa on of those who remain i sai all honour to such nobl
soul for sure thei ar of the salt of the earth
note on the religion of the salvat armi
the religi faith of the salvat armi as i have observ and
understand it for littl ha been said to me on thi matter is
extrem simpl it believ in an etern heaven for the righteou
anda sad doctrin thi some of us mai thinkin a hell equal
etern for the wicked8 it bedrock is the bibl especi the
new testament which it accept as true without qualif from
the first word to the last troubl itself with no doubt or
critic especi doe it believ in the dual natur of the
saviour in christ as god and in christ as man and in the
possibl of forgiv and redempt for even the most degrad
and defil of human be love is it watchword the spirit of love
is it spirit love arrai in the garment of chariti
in essenti with on except it doctrin much resembl those
of the church of england and of variou dissent protest bodi
the except is that it doe not make us of the sacrament even of
that of communion although on the other hand it doe not deni the
efficaci of those sacrament or object to other even if thei be
member of the armi avail themselv of them thu i have known
an armi offic to join in the communion servic the reason for thi
except is i believ that in the view of gener booth the
sacrament complic matter ar open to argument and attack and
ar not understood by the major of the class with which the armi
deal how their omiss is reconcil with certain promin
passag and direct laid down in the new testament i do not know
to me i confess thi disregard of them seem illog
the motto of the armi is salvat for all and as i have hint in
these page it ha a sure convict of the essenti persist of
miracl in these modern dai it hold that when a man kneel at the
penitentform and get convert a miracl take place within him
if hi repent is true and that thenceforward some grace from on
high will give him the power to overcom the evil in hi heart and
blood
it believ too in the instant efficaci of earnest prayer and in
the possibl of direct commun by thi mean between man and
hi maker
here is an instanc of thi statement while inspect the shelter
in on of the provinci citi i wa shown a certain build which
had recent pass into the possess of the armi the offic who
wa conduct me said that the negoti preliminari to the
acquisit of the leas of thi build had been long and difficult
i remark that these must have caus him anxieti oh no he
answer simpli you see i had talk with the lord about it and i
knew that we should get the place in the end
thi repli mai caus some to smile but i confess i find such
childlik faith touch and even beauti
there is small doubt that conscious or unconsci the salvat
armi ha follow st paul exampl of be all thing to all men
if by all mean it mai save some thi is the reason of it method
which to mani seem so vulgar and offens onc i spoke to an offic
high up in the armi of thi matter instanc amongst other thing
it brass band and loudvoic preach at street corner
my dear sir he repli if we came to convert you we should not
bring a brass band or send a missionari who shout out sacr name
everi minut possibl if we thought that you were open to the
influenc of music we might send a firstrat violinist to plai
piec from the classic master and we should certainli send a man
whom we knew to be your intellectu equal and who could therefor
appeal to your reason but our mission at present is not so much to
you and your class as to the dreg of human the folk we deal with
live in a state of nois of which you have no concept and if we
want to forc them to listen to us we must begin by make a greater
nois in order to attract their attent at all in the same wai it
is of no us wast subtleti on them we have to go straight to the
main point which ar clear and sharp enough to pierc their
drinkbesot intellig or to reach ani fragment of conscienc
thei mai have remain in them
i thought the argument sound and well put and result have prove it
forc sinc the salvat armi undoubtedli get a hold of peopl that
few other form of religi effort seem abl to grasp at least to
ani consider extent
i wish to make it clear howev that i hold no particular brief for
the armi it theologi and it method i recogn fulli as i know
it doe the splendid work that is be done in the religi and
social field by other organ of the same class especi by
dr barnardo home by the waif and strai societi by the church
armi and abov all perhap by anoth societi with which i have
had the honour to be connect in a humbl capac for mani year
that for the prevent of cruelti to children still it remain true
that the salvat armi is uniqu if onli on account of the coloss
scale of it oper it fertil stream flow on steadili from
land to land till it bid fair to irrig the whole earth what i
have written about is but on littl segment of a work which
flourish everywher and even lift it head in roman cathol
countri although in these as yet it make no veri great progress
how potent then and how gener suit to the need of stain and
suffer mankind must be that religion which appeal both to the
west and to the east which is as much at home in java and korea as it
is in copenhagen or glasgow for it should be born in mind that the
basi of the salvat armi is religi that it aim abov
everyth at the convers of men to an activ and live faith in
the plain uncompl tenet of christian to the benefit of
their soul in some futur state of exist and incident to
the reform of their charact while on earth
the social work of which i have been treat is a mere byproduct or
consequ of it main idea experi ha shown that it is of
littl us to talk about hi soul to a man with an empti stomach
first he must be fed and cleans and given some other habit
than the street also the armi ha learn that christ still walk the
earth in the shape of chariti and that religion after all is best
preach by put it maxim into practic that the poor ar alwai
with us and that the first duti of the christian is to bind their
wound and sooth their sorrow afterward he mai hope to cure them
of their sin for he know that unless such a cure is effect
tempor assist avail but littl except in case of pure
misfortun which stand upon anoth and so far as the armi work is
concern upon an outsid foot the caus of the fall must be
remov or that fall will be repeat the man or woman must be born
again must be regener such as i understand it is at onc the
belief of the salvat armi and the object of all it effort
therefor i give to thi book it titl of regener

at it centr almost without intermiss for more than thirtyf

you pleas to form out of it an armi and from that again to secur a
vast revenu i often wish that such peopl could know the struggl
of almost everi individu even amongst the veri poorest between the

fourteen or fifteen year ago some offic were set apart to visit
the lapp who rang over all the territori to the north of
scandinavia thi meant at first onli month of solitari travel
dure the summer and no littl suffer in the winter with littl
appar result but gradual a system of meet wa establish
the peopl confid wa gain and at length it ha been found
possibl to group togeth variou centr of regular activ amongst
these interest but littleknown peopl and now experienc leader
will see both to the perman of all that ha alreadi been begun
and to the further extens of the work
in holland where our work ha assum the proport of a nation
movement the benefic effect of which ar recogn by all
class the canal popul is help by mean of a small sail
ship on which ar held regular meet for them our norwegian
peopl also have a lifeboat call the catherin booth station
upon a stormi and difficult part of the coast which not onli goe out
to help into safeti boat and boat crew but whose crew also hold
meet on island in remot fisher hamlet where no other religi
visitor come
the same principl of adapt to local condit and requir

in dutch india we have not onli a grow missionari work amongst both
javanes and chines but govern institut have been place
under our care where leper the blind and other infirm nativ as
well as neglect children ar medic care for and help in
other wai
in south africa both english and dutchspeak peopl ar unit
under on flag and give themselv up to work amongst the nativ
race round themrac which constitut so grave a problem in the
ey of all thought men who know anyth of the true posit in
south africa on of the latest item of new is that an angoni ha
accept salvat at on of our settlement in mashonaland and on
return to hi own home and workli awai between lake nyassa and
the zambeziha begun to hold meet and to exercis an influenc
upon hi peopl which cannot but end in the establish of our work
amongst them
but to my mind on of the most import featur of our work in all
eastern and african land is our develop of the nativ power under
experienc guidanc to pure salvationist and therefor
nonpolit purpos sure the most potent possibl correct for
the sort of half rebel influenc that ha grown or is grow up in
africa under the name of ethiopian as well as for much of the
strang uneasi among the dumb mass of india is the complet
organ of nativ race under leader who whilst of their own
peopl ar devot to the highest ethic aim and stand in happi
subject to men of other land who have given them a train in
disciplin and uniti which doe not contempl bloodsh
we ar now begin both in india and africa as well as in the west
indi to find experienc nativ offic capabl of take staff
posit that is of becom reliabl leader in larg district
where we ar at work these men have not mere all the advantag of
languag and of fit for the varieti of climat which ar so
try to western but thei show a courag and tenac and
tactin short a capac for leadership and administr such as
no oneat ani rate no on that i know ofexpect to find in them
here is open a prospect of the highest signific
more than can be easili estim ha been done in spread
inform about us for some year past by salvationist belong to
variou nation armi and navi we encourag all such men to group
themselv into brigad so far as mai be allow in their variou
barrack and ship thu unit thei work for their mutual
encourag and for the spread of good influenc among other
it wa such a littl hand that realli began our work in the west
indi and we have now a corp in sierra leon on the west coast of
africa form by men of a west indian regiment temporarili quarter
there the same thing ha happen in sumatra by mean of dutch and
javanes soldier
for british india we natur felt ourselv first of all as to the
heathen world under oblig to do someth and no inconsider
result have follow the effort which were first commenc there
twentyeight year ago our pioneer though thei greatli disturb
the offici white world won the heart of the peopl at a stroke by
wear indian dress live amongst and in the style of the poorer
villag soon indian convert offer themselv for servic and
after train were commiss as offic and it wa at onc seen
that thei would be far more influenti than ani foreign from the
point at which that discoveri wa realli made the work assum
import proport pass at onc in larg measur from the
posit of a foreign mission to be a movement of the peopl
themselv
the vast of the countri and the differ of languag have led to
our treat it as five separ command now under the gener lead
of on headquart incident thi ha help us in deal with
some of the difficulti connect with cast as it ha been possibl
to remov indian offic from on part of india to anoth and we
have made some effort which have i admit prove less success in
some district than in other to deal with cast which within their
own line ar often littl more than trade union with a mixtur of
superstit
meanwhil the practic charact of our work ha shown itself in
effort to help in variou wai the lowest of the peopl to improv
their circumst the need for thi is instantli appar when on
reflect that some 40000000 of the inhabit of india ar alwai
hungri a system of loan bank which ha now been adopt in part by
the govern ha been of great servic to the small
agriculturalist the invent of an extrem simpl and yet greatli
improv hand loom ha prove and will prove veri valuabl to the
weaver new plan of relief in time of scarciti and famin have also
greatli help in some district to win the confid of the peopl
industri school chiefli for orphan children have also been a
featur of the work in some district
recent the govern have seen with what success our peopl have
labour for the salvat of the lower cast have decid to hand
over to us the special care of sever of the crimin tribe who ar
realli the remnant of the aborigin although thi work is at
present onli in it experiment stage all who have examin the
result so far have been delight at the rapid with which we have
brought mani into habit of selfsupport industri who with their
father befor them had been accustom to live entir by plunder
about 2000 person of thi class ar alreadi under our care
there ar some 3000000 of these robber in differ part of india
thei ar onli kept under anyth like control at great cost for
polic and militari supervis but we ar satisfi that if
reason support be given a great proport of them can be
reclaim from their present cours of idl and crime and in ani
case their children can be save
we have been abl in india perhap more than in ani other part of the
world to realiz the intern charact of our work by link
togeth offic from england germani holland and the scandinavian
countri as well as from america in the on great object of help
the heathen peopl but most of all we have rejoic in be abl to
blend east and west european offic have often been place under
more experienc indian comrad as well as vice versa the great
common purpos domin all section of the armi and the influenc
of the spirit of god have unit men of differ level of
intellig and knit them togeth in the same fellowship without
ani unwis mingl of race we have now 2000 offic in india and
that alon is a testimoni of the highest signific to the success
of our effort and to the possibl which lie befor us but even
more import in it bear upon the futur in my estim is
the wonder ambit domin our peopl there to reach everi
class but most of all to deal with the low cast or outcast as thei
ar sometim call mani of our indian offic have follow in the
step of our pioneer in the countri and consum by an enthusiasm
amount to a passion for their fellow have liter sacrif
their live in the ceaseless press forward of their work
in america we have had to deal perhap with the other extrem of
human need throughout canada there is veri littl to be seen of
poverti and wretched in the unit state the great citi begin
inde to have area of vice and miseri not to be surpass in ani of
the older citi of the world but everywher we have found peopl who
have becom forget of god neglect of everi higher duti and
abandon to on or other form of selfish our work in the unit
state especi ha been confront with difficulti peculiar to
the countri it widespread popul and their cosmopolitan
charact be not the least of these nevertheless we have now in
the state and canada nearli 4000 offic lead the work in 1380
corp and societi and 350 social institut i ought to sai that
it ha not been found easi to rais larg number in mani place but
of the generos and devot of those who have unit themselv
with us and the immens amount of work which thei accomplish for
their fellow it is imposs to speak too highli
i look with confid to the futur in both these great countri
govern and local author ar begin to grant us the
facil and help we need to deal effectu with their abandon
class as well as to attack some other problem of a difficult
natur within the last few year we have place in canada more than
50000 emigr chiefli from thi countri their characterist
and their success in their new surround have won for us the
highest commend of the author concern
in the vast field of south america we have as yet onli small forc
but we have establish a good foot with the variou popul
and have alreadi receiv no inconsider help for our pure
philanthrop work from sever of the govern our latest new
extens chile paraguai and peru and panama seem to offer
prospect of success even greater than we have been abl to record in
the argentin or uruguai befor your book is publish we shall
probabl have made a begin also in both bolivia and brazil
the south american republicschiefli popul by the descend of
the poorest class of southern europear professedli roman
cathol the influenc of the priesthood howev ow to variou
caus seem to be on the wane and a habit of abandon all
religi thought is much on the increas but the realiz that
our peopl never attack ani church or quibbl about detail of creed
and ceremoni ha won their wai to the heart of mani and there can
be no doubt that we have a great futur amongst these peopl in peru
the law doe not allow ani person not of the romish church to offer
prayer in public place but when it wa found that our offic made
no troubl of thi but manag all the same to hold openair and
theatr servic veri much in our usual style great number of the
peopl were astonish at the new religion and so mani had soon
begun to prai in privat that we have littl doubt about the futur
of our work there
in think of the futur i cannot overlook our plan of organ
which have i am persuad much to do with the proper mainten and
continu of the work we have taken in hand
while strive as much as possibl to avoid red tape or inde ani
method like to hinder initi and enterpris we ar care to
appli a system comprehens to the most untrain mind so
that we mai make everi on feel a proper degre of respons as
well as guard them from mere emotion and spasmod activ
accompani as that kind of thing often is by gener neglect
thu no on can join the armi until after satisfi the local offic
and some resid of the place dure a period of trial of the
sincer of hi profess he must then sign our articl of war
these articl describ precis our doctrin our promis to
abstain from intoxic worldli pleasur and fashion bad or
unworthi languag or conduct and unfair to either employ or

in addit to see that thei regularli carri out their work have

charg of the whole provinc and each countri ha it nation
headquart under a territori commission all be under the
lead of the intern headquart in london
no time is wast in committe or debat amongst us and yet in
all matter of financ and properti there is such arrang that
sever individu ar cogniz of everi detail and that no on
person fault or neglect shall necessarili involv perman injuri
or loss the central account in each countri includ those in
london ar under the care of public auditor but we have also our
own intern audit depart whose repres visit everi
headquart from time to time so as to make sure not onli that the
account ar kept on our approv system but that all expenditur is
rigidli critic all who realli look into our financi method ar
impress by their economi and precis the fact is that almost all
our peopl have been well school in poverti thei have learn the
valu of penc
all thi seem to me to have great import in connexion with
estim of our futur on the on hand we ar ever seek to
impress on all our peopl the suprem need of god spirit of love and
life and freedom without whose presenc the most carefulli manag
system could not but speedili grow cold and useless but at the same
time we insist that the servic of god howev full of love and
glad ought to be more precis more regular nai more exact
than that of ani inferior master
ii
as to your question whether we ar gener make progress i think
i can sai that view the whole field of activ and take into
account everi aspect of the work the armi is undoubtedli on the
upgrad natur progress is not so rapid in on countri as
anoth nor is it alwai so mark in on period as in anoth in
particular countri nor is it alwai so evid in some depart
of effort as in other but speak of the whole there is as inde
there ha been from the veri begin steadi advanc
in some countri of cours there is more rapid develop of our
pure evangelist propaganda while in other our philanthrop
agenc ar more activ progress in human affair is gener
tidal it ha been so with us a period of great outward activ is
sometim follow by on of compar rest and in the same wai the
spirit of advanc in on depart sometim pass from that for a
time to other a period of great progress in all kind of pioneer
work for exampl in germani is just now be follow there by on
of consolid and organ a time of enorm advanc in all
our depart of charit effort in the unit state is now be
succeed by a wonder manifest of pure spiritu fervour and
awaken
in thi the old countri our veri success ha in some wai milit
against our continu advanc at the old rate of progress not onli
ha much ground alreadi been occupi but innumer agenc
model outwardli at least after those we first establish have
sprung into exist and ar work on a field of effort which wa
at on time larg left to us and yet dure the last five year the
armi ha enorm strengthen it hold on the confid of all
class of the peopl here increas it number develop in a
remark degre it intern organ greatli ad to it
materi resourc as well as maintain and extend it offer of
men and monei for the support of the work in heathen countri
but even in place where we have appear to be stagnant in the sens
of not undertak ani new aggress activ we ar constantli
make as a part of our regular warfar new captur from the enemi of
soul maintain the care of congreg and peopl link with
us work at full pressur our social machineri train the
children for futur labour rais up men and women to go out into
the world as missionari of on kind or anoth and do it all
while carri on vigor effort to bring to those who ar most
needi in everi local both materi and spiritu support
like all aggress movement the armi is of cours peculiarli
subject to loss of on kind or anoth that aris from the remov
of it peopl alon constitut a seriou item ani on who know
anyth of religi work amongst the workingclass will understand
how great a loss mai be causedeven where the popul is
gener speak increasingbi the remov of on or two zealou
local leader but such loss ar trifl compar with those which
follow from some stoppag of employ when larg number of workmen
must either migrat or starv
similar result often occur from the chang of leadership the remov
of our offic from point to point and even from countri to countri
is on of our most indispens need but of cours we have to pai
for it chiefli in the disloc and discourag and loss
which it often necessarili entail
so far from such variat be in ani wai discredit to us we
think them on of the most valuabl test of the vital and courag
of our peopl both offic and soldier that thei fight on
unflinchingli under such circumstancesfight on happili to prove
that while fluctuat of thi charact ar veri try thei often
also open the wai both to the wider diffus of our work elsewher
and to the break up of entir new ground in the old centr
in brief it is with us at all time a real warfar wherein triumph
can onli be secur at the cost of struggl that ar veri often
pain and unpleas you cannot have the aggress the advanc
the captur of war without the chang the alarm the cost the
wound the loss which ar insepar from it
a veri strike and thought descript of some of the work done at
on of our london corp ha recent been issu by a wellknown
writer i refer to broken earthenwar by mr harold begbi no on
can read the book without be impress by the sens of person
insight which it reveal but how few take in it main lesson that
the armi is in everi place go on not onli with the recoveri but
with the develop of broken men and women into more and more
capabl and effici servant and rescuer of their fellow
that thi should be so is remark enough as appli to western
broken by evil habit and more or less surround by wreckag but how
much more valuabl when appli to the teem popul of the
east there in so mani case there is no past of crimin or even
of vice as we understand it to forget but onli an infanc of dark
and ignor as to christ and the liberti he bring
mani of our best indian offic have been snatch from on form or
other of outrag selfish but thousand of our peopl there ar
gradual emerg from what is realli the prolong childhood of a
race to see and know how influenti the light of god can make even
them amongst their fellow ten year ago in japan a salvationist
offic wa a strang if not an unknown phenomenon but with everi
increas of the christian and western influenc in that countri
everi capabl wit to christ becom quit apart from ani effort
of hi own a much more notic consult and imit exampl than
he wa befor in korea after a coupl of year effort we have seen
most strike result of our work and have just sent to work among
their own peopl our first twenti marri korean after a
preliminari period of train for officership it is most difficult
to realiz the revolut involv in the whole outlook on life to men
who have been look upon as littl more than serf without ani
prospect of influenc in their countri
the same process of inner and outer develop which have made of
the unknown english workman or workwoman of twenti year ago the
recogn servant of the commun welcom everywher by mayor
and magistr to help in the servic of the poor will out of the
clever orient i believ far more rapidli develop leader in the
new line of christian improv in everi sphere of life it is
consider such as these which make me sai sometim that the
danger in the armi is not in the direct of magnifi but rather
of minim the influenc that ar carri us upward and outward
in everi part of the world
but in our own estim there is anoth reason which perhap equal
all these for calcul upon a wider develop of the armi
futur influenc dure the last twenti year we have been press
forward amongst a veri larg number of church and missionari effort
our speaker have notori been amongst the most unlearn and
ungrammat and therefor often despis while so mani thousand
of univers men were preach and write of christ but no on now
disput the fact that the oldfashion proclam of the doctrin
of jesu christ as a divin saviour of the lost ha larg gone out
of fashion the influenc of the priest of the clerk in holi order
of the minist ha been so larg undermin that candid for
the ministri ar becom scarc in mani church just while we ar
see them aris in steadili increas number from among the veri
peopl who know the armi and it work best and who have most
carefulli observ the demand of sacrific and labour it make upon
it leader
on cannot but rejoic when on hear ever and anon of some confer
or congress at which variou effort ar made to recov at ani rate
the appear of a forward movement in the church but the most
seriou fact of all perhap is the mixtur amongst these
christian plan whether in on countri or anoth of the
unbeliev leaven so that it is possibl for men to go forth as the
emissari of christian who have ceas to believ in the divin
natur of it founder and who look for success rather to scheme of
educ and of social and tempor improv than to that new
creation of man by god power wherein li all our hope as inde
it must be the hope of everi true servant of christ
but i call attent to these fact not to reproach ani church far
from it i simpli desir to point out on reason for think
ourselv justifi in anticip for the armi a futur influenc
far beyond anyth we have yet experienc
recent defenc of christian revel have in our view been far
more serious damag than ani attack that have ever been made from
the hostil camp in the hopea vain hopeof concili
opposit there ha too often been a timid surrend of much that
can alon give author to christian testimoni if jesu christ wa
not compet to decid the truth or untruth of the divin revel
which he fulli and constantli endors as such how absurd it is to
suppos that ani eulogi of hi charact can save him from the just
contempt of all fearless thinker no matter to what nation thei
belong
the armi find itself alreadi and everi year seem more and more
like to find itself the onli firm and unalter wit to the
truth of christ and of hi redeem work in mani neighbourhood and
district among them even some wide stretch of christian territori
and the time can onli bring upon us it seem to me more and more
the scrutini of all who wish to know whether the declar of the
scriptur as to god work in men ar or ar not reliabl thi
then howev melancholi the reflect mai beand to me it is in
some aspect melancholi indeedassur to us a futur of far wider
import and influenc than ani we have dream of in the past
our strength as your book eloqu show in deal with the
deepest sunken the forgotten the outcast of societi the pariah
and leper of modern life ha ever been our absolut certainti with
regard to christ love and power to help them how much greater must
of necess be the valu and influenc of our testimoni where the
veri exist of christ and hi salvat becom a matter of doubt
and disput here at ani rate is on reason which lead me to
believ that the salvat armi ha befor it a futur of the highest
moment to the world
iii
in relat to other religi bodi our posit is marvel
alter from the time when thei nearli all if not quit all
denounc us
i do not think that ani of the church in ani part of the world do
thi now although no doubt individu here and there ar still
bitterli hostil to us in the unit state and in mani of the
british coloni the church welcom our help and gener speak
well of our work and even mani roman cathol leader as well as
author of the jewish faith mai be includ in thi statement on
the contin there ar sign that thei ar slowli turn the same
wai
now i confid expect a steadi extens of thi feel toward
us as the church come more and more to recogn that we not onli do
not attack them but that we ar actual auxiliari to their forc
not onli gain our audienc and recruit from those who ar outsid
their ministr but even serv them by do work for their
adher which for a varieti of reason thei find it veri difficult
if not imposs to accomplish themselv
at the same time it would be a mistak to think that we have ani
desir to adopt ani of their method or ceremoni we keep
everywher to our simpl and nonecclesiast habit and while we
certainli have some veri signific and impress ceremoni of our
own the wai our build ar fit the style of our song and
music and the charact of our prayer and public talk ar
everywher entir distinct and ar nowher in ani danger of
come into seriou competit with the worship adopt by the
church
some of our lead offic think that in on respect our relat
to the church their pastor and peopl ar unsatisfactori in the
unit state it is customari for the clergi and leader of everi
church to treat our leader with the most manifest sympathi and
respect but there is far too mark a contrast between that treatment
and that which we receiv in mani other countri there ar of
cours splendid except still few member of ani church ar
will to be seen in activ associ with us
i daresai thi is veri larg a question of class or cast and i am
veri far from make it a matter of complaint we would in fact far
rather that our peopl should be regard as outcast than that thei
should be tempt to tone down the direct of their wit or
that thei should come under the influenc of those uncertainti and
misgiv to which i have alreadi made refer nevertheless it is
certainli no wish of our that there should remain ani distanc
between us and ani true follow of christ by whatev name thei mai
be call and so we keep firmli even where it mai seem difficult or
impolit to do so to our origin attitud of entir friendli
with all those who name the name of christ

2 the follow extract from the recent issu report of
the commission of prison and the director of convict prison
for the year end march 31 1910 part i cd 5360 publish sinc
the abov wa written set out the present view of the author
on thi import matter
out of the present inmat of convict prison over 40 per
cent have been previous in penal servitud viz out of
3046 male convict in convict prison 1253 had been
previous sentenc to penal servitud 672 onc 271
twice 196 three time and 114 four time or more mr
secretari churchil ha refer to us the question whether
and in what wai it would be possibl to make ani impress
on thi roll of recidivismthi unyield corpu of
habitu crime the problem is never absent from the mind
of those respons for the administr of prison and
the treatment of crime and dure recent year great
effort have been made to improv the machineri of
assist on discharg fulli impress as we ar with the
truth of the old french sai le difficil ce nest pa
emprison un homm cest de le relcher we have tri
to avail ourselv fulli of the resourc offer by such
power agenc as the church armi salvat armi as
well as other societi who have for year oper in thi
particular field of charit effort we recogn the
readi help given by all these agenc no doubt by their
effort mani difficult and unpromis case have been
rehabilit but after full consider we have come to
the opinion that the task of rehabilit in the case of
men return to freedom after a sentenc of penal servitud
is too difficult and too costli to be left entir to
voluntari societi unaid by ani grant of public fund
and work independ of each other at a problem where
uniti of method and direct is abov all thing requir
mr secretari churchil to whom these view have been
repres at onc agre that the difficulti lai in thi
question of discharg and that the offici author
act in close and friendli cooper with the voluntari
societi must take a more activ part than hitherto in
control the passag into free life of a man emerg
from penal servitud a plan is now under consider
for establish a central agenc of control for discharg
convict on which both the offici and unoffici element
will be repres with a subsidi from public fund the
purpos of which will be to take in hand the guidanc and
direct of everi convict on the dai of discharg pp 15
