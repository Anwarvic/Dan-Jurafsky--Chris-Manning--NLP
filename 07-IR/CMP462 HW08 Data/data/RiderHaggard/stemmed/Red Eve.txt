in time of flood if the fire reach us we must perish of flame or
smoke or both

a merchant which wa heavi of such a make as the ancient roman us
and sharpen on either edg neither of them wore armour sinc hugh
had no right to do so and john had not come out to fight
thei stood still for a moment in the midst of a breathless silenc the

red the smokecloud rise from the sullen burn marsh into which
the fire wa still eat far awai the water of the blyth brim
with the tide that had just turn toward the sea the snow and ic
itself even the triangl of wild swan brought by the hard weather from
the northern land look red as thei pursu their heavi and majest

round each other but out of reach
then at length john claver rush in and thrust hugh sprang back
befor hi point again he rush and thrust and again hugh sprang
back a third time and hugh fairli ran whereon a shout went up from the
claver

as the word left hi lip claver fell sprawl on hi back for
hugh had caught hi leg with hi left arm and thrown him so that thei

attack and john who gave back right to the river edg for skill and
courag seem to fail him at onc
turn your head ladi said dick for now on must die but ev could
not
the sword flash for the last time in the red light then that of de
cressi vanish claver threw hi arm wide and fell backward a
splash as of a great stone thrown into water and all wa done
hugh stood a moment on the river bank stare at the stream beneath
then he turn and began to walk slowli toward the dead swan
er ever he reach it sir john claver fell from hi hors in a
swoon and a shout of rage went up from all hi peopl
kill him thei yell and leapt forward
now hugh understood and ran for the point of land on man a
frenchman got in front of him he cut him down and sped on
what now said ev as he join them

rememb i slew your brother said hugh hoars
i rememb that he would have slain you she answer and leapt
straight from the point into the ici flood beneath which her head sank
when it rose again there wa anoth head besid it that of dead john
who appear for on moment to be seen no more for ever sinc er
morn the ocean had him
now hugh leapt after her and present the pair of them were swim
side by side to the river further shore then as now it wa but a
narrow stream yet thei did not reach it easili for cumber as thei
were with cloth and numb by the icecold water the fierc tide
caught them and carri them beyond the bend there thei were lost in
the gather dark so that most of those who watch believ that
thei had sunk and drown but it wa not so for after a long struggl
thei came safe to shore near to a clump of willow and clamber over
the frozen mud to the heath beyond
first fire then water said hugh in a maze voic

for a dai that is not done but whither now
to take sanctuari at the preceptori and rais my kin forward ev er

broke into a run
now night close in and the snow which had been threaten all dai
began to fall make their path over the heath difficult
we need grei dick to guid us but alack i fear he is dead mutter
hugh
i think other will be dead not dick she answer
just then thei heard a footstep behind them
hugh wheel round and drew hi sword but almost befor it had left the
scabbard a long figur glide out of the snow and said
more to the left master more to the left unless you would make your
peac on blythburgh bridg where some would be glad to meet you
how went it ask hugh shortli
not well i shot thrice and slew three men two of the french knight
and thoma of kessland against whom i had a score that now is settl
but the fourth time i miss
who ask ev between her teeth as she ran besid him
the frenchman who mean to marri you when the other fell back he came
at me on hi hors as i wa set a fresh arrow think to get me i
had to shoot quick and aim low for hi heart becaus in that light
i could not make certain of hi face he saw and jerk up the hors
head so that the shaft took it in the throat and kill the beast
without hurt it rider he wa off in an instant and at me with
other befor i could draw again so i thought it time to go which i
did backward as he thrust perhap he think he kill me as i meant
he should onli when he look at hi sword hell find it clean that

edmund of noyon
father arnold ceas read and hugh gasp out
what a fool is thi knavecount
most men ar my son in thi wai or in that and the few wise profit
by their folli thu thi letter which he thought so safe will save
england to edward and hi race you from mani danger your betroth
from a marriag which she hatesthat is if you can get safe awai with

where to father
to king edward in london with anoth that i will write for you er
the dawn
but is it safe father to trust so preciou a thing to me who have
bitter enemi await me and mai as like as not be crow meat by
tomorrow
father arnold look at him with hi soft and dreami ey then said
i think the crow not hatch that will pick your bone hugh though
at the last there be crow or worm for all of us
why not father doubtless thi morn young john of claver
thought as much and now he is in the stakenet or food for fish
would you like to hear hugh and will you keep it to yourself even
from ev
ay that i would and will
hell think me mad mutter the old priest to himself then went
on aloud as on who take a sudden resolut well ill tell you
leav you to make what you will of a stori that till now ha been
heard by no live man
far in the east is the great countri that we call cathai though in
truth it ha mani other name and i alon of all who breath in england
have visit that land
how did you get there ask hugh amaz for though he knew dimli
that father arnold had travel much in hi youth he never dream
that he had reach the mystic territori of cathai or inde that
such a place realli wa except in fabl
it would take from now till morn to tell son nor even then would
you understand the road it is enough to sai that i went on a pilgrimag
to jerusalem where our bless saviour di that wa the begin
thenc i travel with arab to the red sea where wild men made a
slave of me and we were blown across the indian ocean to a beauteou
island name ceylon in which all the folk ar black
from thi place i escap in a vessel call a junk that brought me
to the town of singapor thenc at last follow my star i came to
cathai after two year of journei there i dwelt in honour for
three more year move from place to place sinc never befor had it
inhabit seen a western man and thei made much of me alwai send
me forward to new citi so at length i reach the greatest of them
all which is call kambaluc or peke and there wa the guest of it
emperor timur
all the stori of my life and adventur yonder i have written down and
ani who will mai read it after i am dead but of these i have no time to
speak nor have thei anyth to do with you whilst i dwelt in kambaluc
as the guest of the emperor timur i made studi of the religion of thi
mighti peopl who i wa told worship god in the shape of men i
visit a shrine call the templ of heaven hope that there i should
see such a god who wa name tien but found in it noth but splendid
empti
then i ask if there wa no god that i could see with my ey
whereon the emperor laugh at me and said there wa such a god but
he counsel me not to visit him i prai him to suffer me to do so
sinc i who worship the onli true god fear no other whereon
grow angri he command some of hi servant to take thi fool to
the hous of murgh and let him see whether hi god could protect him
against murgh have said thi he bade me farewel ad that though
everi man must meet murgh onc few met him twice and therefor he did
not think that he should see me again
now in my heart i grew afraid but none would tell me more of thi
murgh or what wa like to happen to me at hi hand still i would
not show ani fear and strong in the faith of christ i determin to
look upon thi idol for such i expect him to be
that night the servant of timur bore me out of the citi in a litter
and by the starlight i saw that we travel toward a hill through great
graveyard where peopl were buri their dead at the foot of the
hill thei set me down upon a road and told me to walk up it and that
at dawn i should see the hous of murgh whereof the gate were alwai
open and could enter there if i wish i ask if thei would wait for
my return whereon thei answer smile that if i so desir thei
would do so till even but that it seem scarc need sinc
thei did not suppos that i should return
do yonder pilgrim to the hous of murgh return ask their captain
point toward those graveyard which we had pass
i made no answer but walk forward up a broad and easi road
unchalleng of ani till i came to what even in that dim light i
could see wa a great and frown gatewai whereof the door appear
to be open now at first i thought i would pass thi gatewai at onc
and see what lai beyond but from thi i wa held back by some great
fear for which i could find no caus unless it were bred of what
the emperor and hi servant had said to me so i rememb their
wordsnam that i should tarri till dawn to enter the hous
there then i tarri seat on the ground befor the gatewai and
feel as though yet aliv i had descend among the dead inde
the silenc wa that of the dead no voic spoke no hound bark no
leaf stir onli far abov me i heard a continu sough as though
wing soul pass to and fro never in my life had i felt so much
alon never so much afraid
at length the dawn broke and oh glad wa i to see it light for fear
lest i should die in dark now i saw that i wa on a hilltop
where grew great grove of cedar tree and that set amid them wa a
blacktil templ surround by a wall built of black brick
it wa not a great place although the gatewai which wa surmount by
two black dragon of stone or iron wa veri great so great that a tall
ship could have sail through it and left it arch untouch
i kneel down and prai to the bless saint and the guardian angel
to protect me then i aros cross myself to scare off all evil thing
by that holi sign and set forward toward the mighti gatewai oh never
never till that hour had i understood how lowli a thing is man on that
broad road travel toward the aw dragonguard arch beyond
which lai i knew not what it seem to me that i wa the onli man
left in the world i whose hour had come to enter the portal of
destruct
i pass into the cold shadow of the gatewai unchalleng by ani
watchman and found myself in a courtyard surround by a wall also
built of black brick which had door in it that seem to be of dark
stone or iron whither these door led i do not know sinc the wall cut
off the sight of ani build that mai have lain beyond in the centr
of thi courtyard wa a pool of still black water and at the head of
the pool a chair of black marbl
sir andrew paus and hugh said
a plain place for a templ father without adorn or imag but
perhap thi wa the outer court and the templ stood within
ay son the plainest templ that ever i saw who have seen mani in
all land though what wa beyond it i do not know and yetterr
terribl terriblei tell you that those black wall and that black
water were more fearsom to look on than ani churchyard vault grim
with bone or a torturepit where victim quiver out their soul
midst shriek and groan and yet i could see noth of which to be
afraid and hear noth save that sough of invis wing whereof i
have spoken an empti chair a pool of water some wall and door and
abov the quiet sky what wa there to fear in such thing as these
still so greatli did i fear that i sank to my knee and began to prai
onc more thi time to the bless saviour himself sinc i wa sure
that none els could help me
when i look up again the chair wa no longer empti hugh a man sat
in it of whom i thought at first onli on thingthat he must be veri
strong though not bigger than other men strength seem to flow from
him i should not have wonder if he had place hi hand upon the
massiv side of that stone chair and torn it asund
what wa he like father samson or goliath
i never saw either son so cannot sai but what wa he like oh i
cannot sai that either although still i see him in my heart my mortal
lip will not tell the like of that man perhap becaus he seem
to be like all men and yet differ from all he had an iron brow
beneath which shone deep cold ey he wa cleanshaven or perchanc
hi face grew no hair hi lip were thick and still and hi featur
did not chang like those of other men he look as though he could not
chang as though he had been thu for infinit ag and yet remain
neither young nor old as for hi dress he wore a cloak of flame red
such a cloak as your ev love to wear and white sandal on hi feet
there wa no cover on hi shaven head which gleam like a skull
hi breast wa nake but across it hung on row of black jewel
from the sheen of them i think thei must have been pearl which ar
sometim found of that colour in the east he had no weapon nor staff
and hi hand hung down on either side of the chair
for a long while i watch him but if he saw me he took no note as
i watch i perceiv that bird were come to and leav him in
countless number and thought that it must be their wing which made
the constant sough sound that fill all the still and dread air
what kind of bird were thei father
i am not sure but i think dove at least their flight wa straight
and swift like to that of dove yet of thi i am not sure either
sinc i saw each of them for but a second as thei reach the man thei
appear out of nothing thei were of two colour snowwhit and
coalblack the white appear upon hi right side the black upon
hi left side each bird in those neverceas stream hover for an
instant by hi head the white over hi right shoulder the black over
hi left shoulder as though thei whisper a messag to hi ear and
have whisper were gone upon their errand
what wa that errand father
how can i know as no on ever told me yet i will hazard a guess that
it had to do with the mysteri of life and death soul that were born
into the world and soul depart from the world perchanc make
report to on of god minist cloth in flesh but who can sai at
least i watch those magic fowl till my ey grew dizzi and a sort of
slumber began to creep into my brain
how long i stai thu i do not rememb for i had lost all sens of
time in the end howev i wa awaken by a cold soft voic the
sound of which seem to flow through my vein like ic that address
me in our own rough english tongu spoken as you and i learn it at
our nurs knee
to what god were you prai just now andrew arnold
oh sir i answer how do you who dwell in cathai where i am a
stranger know my languag and my name
he lift hi cold ey and look at me and i felt them pierc into
the depth of my soul in the same wai that i know your heart he
said but do not ask question answer them that i mai learn whether
you ar a true man or a liar
i wa prai to christ i falter the saviour of us all
a great god andrew arnold and a pure though hi follow ar few
in the world as yet but do you think that he can save you from me as
you were ask him to do
he can save my soul i repli pluck up courag who would not
deni the lord even in a devil den
ah your soul well i have noth to do with soul except to count
them as thei pass through my dominion and you ar quit right to prai
to on of the lord of that into which you go now man what is your
busi with me and why do you visit on of whom you ar so much
afraid
o murgh i began then ceas for i knew not what to answer
so thei have told you my name now i will tell you on of it
mean it is gate of the god why did you dare to visit gate of
the god you fear to answer listen you came forth to see some paint
idol or some bedizen priest mutter rite he doe not understand to
that which is not and lo you have found that which is behind all idol
and all priest you sought an incens and a golden shrine and you
have found onli the black and iron portal which everi man must pass but
which few desir to enter until thei ar call well you ar young and
strong come try a fall with murgh and when he ha thrown you rise and
choos which of those wai you will and he swept hi hand toward the
door around him then forget thi world and enter into that which you
have chosen
now becaus i could not help myself i rose from my knee and
advanc or wa drawn toward that dread man as i came he too rose
from hi chair stretch out hi arm as a wrestler doe and i knew
that within the circl of those arm lai my death still i who in my
youth wa held brave went on and rush strive to clasp him next
moment befor ever i touch himoh well wa it for me that i touch
him notsom strength seiz me and whirl me round and round as a
dead leaf is whirl by the wind and toss me up and cast me down and
left me prone and nerveless
rise said the cold voic abov me for you ar unhurt
so i rose and felt even then that i who thought that everi bone in my
bodi must be broken wa stronger than i had ever been befor it wa as
though the lamp which had burnt low wa fill suddenli with a new and
purer oil
man said mine adversari and i thought that in hi cold ey there
wa someth like a smile did you think to touch murgh and live did
you think to wrestl with him as in a book of on of your prophet a
certain jacob wrestl with an angel and conquereduntil it wa hi
turn to pass the gate of the god
now i stare at thi dweller in cathai who spoke my tongu and knew
the tale of jacob in the ancient book then answer
sir murgh or sir gate or whatev your name mai be i thought to do
noth you drew me to you you challeng me and sinc by the rule
of my order i mai refus no challeng from on who is not a christian
i came on to do my best but befor ever i laid hand on you i wa cast
down by a wind that is all the stori save that it ha pleas you to
let me live who evid could have slain me for which i thank you
you ar wrong sir andrew he answer i did not draw you to me
men come to murgh at their appoint hour murgh doe not come to them
you sought him befor your hour and therefor he refus you yet you
will meet him again as all flesh must when it hour come and becaus
you ar bold and have not cring befor my strength for your comfort
i will show you when and how stand by me but lai no hand on me or my
robe and look into my glass while for a moment for your sake i stai
the stream of time and show you what li beneath it foam that blind
the ey of men
he wave hi arm and the black dove and the white dove ceas to
appear and disappear and the etern sough of their wing wa
silent he point to the water at hi feet and i saw not a pictur
but a scene so real that i could have sworn it wa aliv about me ye
those who took part in it stood in front of me as though the pool were
solid ground that their feet press you were on of them son you
were on of them and the old knight paus support himself against
the mantelshelf as though that recollect overcam him
what did you see whisper hugh
by god holi name i saw the blythburgh marsh deep in snow that wa
red bloodr with the light of sunris oh i could not be mistook
and there ran the wintri river there the church tower soar there

which the east wind pipe for the dead bracken bent befor it and not
twenti pace from me leap a hare disturb suddenli from it form by
a hungri fox whose red head peep through the reed ye ye i saw
the brute white teeth gleam as it lick it disappoint lip and
i felt glad that it prei had beaten it when you look upon that scene

fox and by these judg my truth

river where jag sheet of ic ground against each other like the
teeth of the wick in hell strang cap and clad in black hi
arm cross upon hi breast and a light smile in hi cold ey he who
wa call murgh in cathai he who name himself gatewai of the god
for a moment i saw then all wa gone and i found myselfi know not

dove and the white dove in countless multitud all the thousand
of them that had been stai in their flight pour down upon him at

side of the glow hearth whose red light illumin their face at
length the heavi silenc wa broken by sir andrew

sudden i knew that it wa you two and no other whom that god or devil

hugh who wa glad to get back to the thing of earth describ acour

ah said sir andrew much such a man as stood face to face with you
by the grave while murgh watch and you ar not like to be friend
ar you but i forgot you have determin that it wa but a dream and
now you ar wonder how he who is call gate of the god in cathai

garden given to him by god but doubtless that onli anoth face of
my dream whereof well speak no moreat present now for your troubl
which ar no dream lie you down to sleep on the skin of that stripe
beast i kill it in cathayin my dai of dream and now it shall
serv for your from which mai the dead ey of john claver be

with grei dick at the door youll be safe for a while i think if not
here a cupboard where you mai hide and draw asid the arra he

the room
hugh laid himself upon the skin of the beast which had been a tiger
though he did not know it by that name so weari wa he that not all he
had gone through that dai or even the old warriorpriest marvel
tale in which he and ev plai so wonder a part could keep hi
ey from close present he wa fast asleep and so remain until
four hour later someth disturb him and he awok to see sir
andrew write at a desk

daybreak and keep a whole skin i have set a taper in my sleepingcloset
yonder and there youll find water to wash with and a stool to kneel on
for your prayer neither of which neglect sinc you have blood on your
hand and great need for heaven help
so hugh aros yawn and stumbl heavili to the chamber for he wa
still faint with sleep which would not leav him till he had plung
hi head into a basin of ici water thi done he knelt and prai as he
had been bidden with a veri earnest heart and afterward came back to
the guesthal
see folk gather there as he enter he laid hand on sword not hi
own with which he had kill hi cousin but a long and knightli weapon
that sir andrew had given him with the armour draw it he advanc
boldli for he thought that hi enemi might have found him out and
that hi best safeti lai in courag thu he appear in the ring of the
lamplight clad in gleam steel and with rais weapon

father is it not enough to have kill your cousin would you fall
on your brother and me also that you come at us clad in mail and with
bare steel in hand

speaker a handsom portli man who wore a merchant robe line with
rich fur sank to hi knee befor him

the stori also that i am not to blame for thi bloodshed
i think you need to ask it repli master de cressi and if you and
that lean henchman of your ar not to blame then sai who is
now a tall slim figur glide up to them it wa ev cloth in her
own robe again and beauti as ever after her short rest
sir i am to blame she said in her full low voic my need wa sore

here food wa wait for them prepar by the old sister agn it wa
a somewhat silent meal of which no on at veri much except grei dick
who remark aloud that as thi might be hi last breakfast it should be
plenti sinc shriven or unshriven it wa better to die upon a full
stomach
master de cressi call him an impiou knave then he ask him if he
had plenti of arrow becaus if not he would find four dozen of the
best that could be made in norwich done up in a cloak on the grei hors
he wa to ride and a spare bow also
i thank you for the arrow master but as for the bow i us none but

as he spoke there came a knock upon the outer door and everi on sprang
up

frenchman is out of england or perchanc he ad grimli under

so thei descend to a back entranc and through it into the courtyard
where the four arm men wait with six good hors on of them hugh
own here he bade farewel to hi brother to hi father who kiss
him on the brow and to sir andrew who stretch hi hand abov hi

befal rememb that dead or live ill be wife to no man but you
begon now er my heart fail me and guard yourself well rememb
that you bear in your breast not on life but two
then hugh swung himself to the saddl of which grei dick had alreadi
test the girth and stirrup leather in anoth minut the six of
them were clatter over the stone of middleg street while the
burgess of dunwich peep from their window place wonder what
knight with arm men rode through their town thu earli
just as the grei dawn broke thei pass the gate which there be
peac in the land wa alreadi open fifteen minut later thei were
on the lone westleton heath where for a while naught wa to be heard
save the scream of the curlew and the rush of the wing of the wildduck
pass landward from the sea present howev anoth sound reach
their ear that of hors gallop behind them grei dick pull rein
and listen
seven i think not more he said now master do you stand or run
for these will be claver hors
hugh thought for a moment hi aim wa not to fight but to get through
to london yet if he fled the pursuer would rais the countri on them
as thei came so that in the end thei must be taken sinc those who
follow would find fresh hors
it seem best to stand he said
so sai i answer grei dick and led the wai to a littl hillock by
the roadsid on which grew some windbent fir
here thei dismount and gave their hors into the keep of on man
while grei dick and the other drew their bow from the case and strung
them scarc had thei done so when the mist lift in the morn
breez show them their pursuersseven of them as dick had
saidhead by on of the french knight and ride scatter between
two and three hundr yard awai at the same moment a shout told them
that thei had been seen
hark now all said hugh i would shed no more blood if it mai be so
who have earn enough of penanc therefor shoot at the hors not
at the rider who without them will be helpless and let no man harm a
claver unless it be to save hi own life
poor sport grunt grei dick
nevertheless when the norman knight who led came within two hundr
yard shout to them in french to surrend dick lift hi great
bow drew and loos carelessli as though he shot at hazard the other
hold their bow till the claver were nearer yet there wa littl
of hazard when grei dick shot save to that at which he aim awai
rush the arrow rise high and as it seem bear somewhat to the
left of the knight yet when it drew near to that knight the wind told
on it and bent it inward as he knew it would fair and full it struck
upon the hors chest pierc through to the heart so that down the
poor beast came throw it rider to the ground
a good shot enough grumbl grei dick still it is a shame to slai
nag of such a breed and let the rogu who ride them go
but hi companion onli stare at him almost in aw while the other
claver men rode on befor thei had cover fifti pace again the
great bow twang and again a hors wa seen to rear itself up

in a glade of the forest of windsor situat near to the castl and
measur some twentyf score yard of open level ground stood
grei dick a strang uncouth figur at whom the archer of the guard
laugh nudg each other in hi boni hand howev he held that
at which thei did not laugh name the great black bow six feet
six inch long which he said had come to him from the sea and wa
fashion not of yew but of some heavi closegrain wood grown
perhap in southern or even in far eastern land still on of them
who had tri to draw thi bow to hi ear and could not said aloud that
the suffolk man would do naught with that clumsi pole whereat grei
dick who heard him grin show hi white teeth like an angri
dog
near by on horseback and on foot were the king the young princ
edward and mani knight and ladi while on the other side stood
score of soldier and other folk from the castl who came to see thi
ugli fellow well beaten at hi own game
dick whisper hugh shoot now as you never shot befor teach them
a lesson for the honour of suffolk
let me be master he grumbl i told you i would do my best
then he sat himself down on the grass and began to examin hi arrow
on by on to all appear take no heed of anyth els
present came the first test at a distanc of five score yard wa
set a littl clout or target of white wood not more than two feet
squar thi clout had a red mark or ey three inch across paint

now richard said the king three of the best archer that we have

wa chang and forth came the great archer of the guard a tall and
clearei man name jack green and whom it wa said none had ever
beaten he drew and the arrow went home in the red on it left edg
he drew again and the arrow went home in the red on it right edg he
drew a third time and the arrow went home straight in the veri centr
of the red where wa a littl black spot
now a great laugh went up sinc clearli the suffolk man wa beaten er
ever he began
your dick mai do as well he can do no better said the king when the
target wa brought to him
grei dick look at it
a boon your grace said dick grant that thi clout mai be set up
again with the arrow fast ani mai know them from mine sinc thei ar
grei wherea those i make ar black for i am a fletcher in my spare
hour and love my own handiwork
so be it said the king wonder and the clout wa replac upon

now grei dick stretch himself look at the clout look at hi bow
and set a blackwing arrow on the string then he drew it seem but
lightli and carelessli as though he thought the distanc small awai
flew the shaft and sank into the red a good inch within the leftmost
arrow of jack green
ah said the onlook a lucki shot inde
again he drew and again the arrow sank into the red a good inch within
the rightmost shot of jack green
oh said the onlook thi man is an archer but jack last he
cannot best let the devil help him how he will
in the devil name then be silent wheez grei dick with a flash
of hi halfopen ey

now dick set hi foot apart and arrow on string thrice he lift hi
bow and thrice let it sink again perhap becaus he felt some breath
of wind stir the still air a fourth time he lift and drew not as he
had befor but straight to the ear then loos at onc
awai rush the yardlong shaft and folk note that it scarc seem
to rise as arrow do or at least not half so high it rush it smote
and there wa silenc for none could see exactli what had happen
then he who stood near the target to mark ran forward and scream out
by god name he ha shatter jack green centr arrow and shot
clean through the clout
then from all side rose the old archer cry he he he he while
the young princ threw hi cap on high and the king said
would that there were more such men as thi in england jack green it
seem that you ar beaten
nai said grei dick seat himself again upon the grass there is

skin of hi forehead as thei ever did when he wa move

then a captain of the archer explain thi sport in short it wa
that man should stand against man clad in leather jerkin and wear
a vizor to protect the face and shoot at each other with blunt arrow

and those archer whom he had beaten among them jack green were place
against him stand five yard apart and blunt arrow serv out
to all dick set on of them on the string and laid the two other in
front of them then a knight rode to halfwai between them but a littl
to on side and shout loos

almost as the arrow left the bow flung himself down grasp anoth
as he fell next instant three shaft whistl over where he had stood
but hi found it mark on the bodi of him at whom he had aim caus
the man to stagger backward and throw down hi bow as he wa bound to
do if hit
next instant dick wa up again and hi second arrow flew strike full
and fair befor ever he at whom it wa aim had drawn
now there remain jack green alon and as dick set the third arrow
but befor he could draw jack green shot

hairbreadth of hi ear then came dick turn on jack green cap wa

then while the silenc still reign he set the second arrow on the
string and wait as though he knew not what to do present about
fifti pace from him a wood dove flew from out a tree and as such
bird do at the first breath of spring for the dai wa mild and sunni
hover a moment in the air er it dip toward a great fir where
doubtless it had built for year never poor fowl wa it destin to
build again for as it turn it beak downward dick shaft pierc it
through and through and bore it onward to the earth
still in the midst of a great silenc dick took up hi quiver and
empti it on the ground then gave it to the captain of the archer
sai
and you will step sixti nai seventi pace and set thi mouth upward
in the grass where a man mai see it well
the captain did so prop the quiver straight with stone and a
bit of wood then have studi all thing with hi ey dick shot

as it drew near the quiver and fell into it mouth strike it flat
ill done grumbl dick had i shot well it should have been pin

harder for all those about him but seldom had he been angrier than he
wa thi dai when hi rage wa mingl with real sorrow for the loss of
hi onli son slain in a fight brought about by the daughter of on of
them and the sister of the other and urg for honour sake by himself
the father of them both
moreov the marriag on which he had set hi heart between ev and the
glitter french lord whose futur seem so great had been brought to
naught and thi turbul hotheart ev had fled into sanctuari her
lover too the youngest son of a merchant had ridden awai to london
doubtless upon some mission which bode no good to him or hi leav
a blood feud behind him between the wealthi de cressi and all the
claver kin
there wa but on drop of comfort in hi cup by now as he hope hugh
and hi deathshead grei dick a spawn of satan that all the countri
fear and who men said wa a de cressi bastard by a witch were
sure slain or taken by those who follow upon their heel
sir john rode to the preceptori and hammer fierc on it oaken door
present it wa open by sir andrew arnold himself who stood in the
entranc grei and grim a long sword girt about hi loin and armour
gleam beneath hi monkish robe
what would you sir john claver that you knock at thi holi hous

sword and he laid hi hand upon it hilt take with her also the
curs of the mother of god and hi belov apostl and that of the
whole church of christ by me declar upon your head in thi world and
upon your soul in the world to come man thi is sanctuari and if you

then he cross himself drew the great sword and hold it in hi
left hand stretch out hi right toward them in maledict
the claver men heard and saw thei look at each other and as
though by common consent turn and rode awai cross themselv
also in truth thei had no stomach for the curs of the church when it
wa thunder forth from the lip of such a monk as sir andrew arnold
who thei knew well had been on of the greatest and holiest warrior
of hi gener and so said rumour wa a white wizard to boot with
all the magic of the east at hi command
your men have gone sir john said the old priest will you follow
them or will you enter
now fear drove out the knight rage and he spoke in anoth voic

a bitter laugh and in my turn i swear thi that after the year thei
shall not wed sinc the on of them will be clai and the other the wife
of the man whom i have chosen now plai no trick on me lest i burn

sir andrew made no repli onli rest hi long sword on the threshold
he leant upon it hilt and fix hi clear grei ey upon claver
face what sir john saw in those ey he never told but it wa
someth which scare him at least that shorten of the breath of
which he had spoken seem to take a hold of him for he swai upon hi
hors as though he were about to fall then recov turn and rode
straight for blythburgh
it wa the second night after that dai when sir andrew had look john
claver in the ey
secretli and in dark those three whom grei dick had kill were
born into the nave of blythburgh church and there laid in the grave
which had been made readi for them till now their corps had been kept
abov ground in the hope that the bodi of john claver the younger
might be ad to their number but search as thei would upon seashor
and riverbank noth of him wa ever seen again thi funer wa
celebr in the dark sinc neither sir john nor acour desir
that all men should see three bodi that had been slain by on archer
aid by a merchant lad stand alon against a score and know to
sai naught of the wound that there wa yet anoth to be ad to
the tale therefor thei inter them by night with no notic of the

it wa a melancholi scene the nave of the great church light onli
with the torch born by the six monk of the black augustin from the
neighbour priori of st osyth the candl littl star of light

were the featur of thi inter it wa done at last and the poor
dead but a few dai befor so full of vigour and of passion were left
to their last sleep in the unrememb grave then the mourner march
back to the manor across the middl marsh and sought their bed in a sad
silenc
shortli after daybreak thei were call from them again by the new that
those who had follow hugh de cressi had return quickli thei rose
think that these came back with tide of accomplish vengeanc to
find themselv face to face with seven starv and miser men who
all their hors be dead had walk hither from dunwich
the wretch stori wa learn at length and then follow that violent
scene which ha been told alreadi when acour curs hi follow as
coward and claver sober perhap by the sad of the midnight
burial or by the memori of arnold word reprov him lastli stung
by the taunt that were heap upon them sir pierr de la roch gave
hugh messagethat if thei lift hand against hi love or hi hous
he would kill them like raven wolv which i think he certainli
will do for none can conquer him and hi henchman he ad shortli
then sir john rage flare up again like fire when fresh fuel is thrown
on ash he curs hugh and grei dick he curs hi daughter he even
curs acour and ask for the second time how it came about that he who
had brought all thi troubl on him wa given the evil name of traitor

hand you ar my daughter affianc ar you not and will give
her high place and mani famou titl and her son shall be call
claver that the old name mai not die but be great in england in
franc and in itali you must bide to marri her lest that cuckoo hugh
de cressi that cuckoo with the sharp bill should creep into my nest

grief for the past and fear for the futur you must bide to marri her
by fair mean or by foul draw her from the sanctuari and marri her
whether she sai you yea or nai you have my leav nobl noyon and so
speak he swai and fell prone upon the floor
at first thei thought that he wa dead but the chaplain nichola who
wa a leech bled him and he came to himself again although he still
wander in hi talk and lai ab
then acour and nichola took counsel togeth
what is to be done said sir edmund for i am on fire for thi maid

father or grandfath were guid by him long ago commit what
crime you will dip yourself to the lip in blood and you mai find

to their fool king is the least of the word thei throw at us

the chaplain cring and bow rub hi thin hand togeth
i thought you wish to speak of the english my lord otherwis i
should not have venturedbut as to the ladi ev someth come to me
why doe she stai in sanctuari who herself ha commit no crime is it
not such is her mad becaus she would be out of reach of you and
your endear now if she believ you gone far enough awai let us

paus
you mean that she might come out of sanctuari of her own accord
ye lord and we might set a spring to catch thi bird so rare and
shy and though shed flutter flutter flutter and peck peck peck
what could she do when you smooth her plumag with your love hand
and a priest wa wait to sai the word that should caus her to forget
her doubt and that merchant bumpkin
ah nichola you have a good wit and if all goe well you shall
certainli be an abbot but would her father do you think
lord that beefeat knight is in such a rage that he would do
anyth what did he sai just befor the stroke took him that you were
to marri her by fair mean or by foul ye and he told me an hour ago
that if onli he knew she wa your wife he would die happi oh you have
hi warrant for anyth you do to bring about thi end still there is
no need to tell him too much lest it should caus hi good name to be
aspers by the vulgar mani it seem love thi red ev for her high
spirit and ar friend to the de cressi an openhand race who know
how to bind folk to them listen how it must be done
that dai it wa given out that sir edmund acour those of hi knight
who remain aliv and all hi follow were about to leav for london
and lai their caus befor the king have learn that hugh de cressi
had gone thither to prejudic hi grace on hi own behalf it wa ad
moreov that thei would not return to suffolk but propos when
thei had found justic or the promis of it to take ship at dover for
franc next morn accordingli thei rode awai from blythburgh manor
and pass through dunwich with much pomp where the citizen of that
town who were friend of the de cressi stare at them with no kind
ey inde on of these as thei cross the marketplac call to
them to be care not to meet hugh de cressi and grei dick upon their
journei lest there should be more midnight burial and menatarm
turn into footsoldi whereat all about him laugh rude
but acour did not laugh he ground hi teeth and said into the ear of
nichola
regist thi vow for me priest that in payment for that jest ill
sack and burn dunwich when our armi come and give it men and children
to the sword and it women to the soldier
it shall be done lord answer the chaplain and should your heart
soften at the appoint time ill put you in memori of thi solemn
oath
at the great hous of the mayor of dunwich sir edmund drew rein and
demand to see him present thi mayor a timid uncertainlook
man came in hi robe of offic and ask anxious what might be the
caus of thi messag and why an arm band halt at hi gate

who need an unwil bride id deliv it myself onli that old knave
half priest and half knight but neither good
youd best speak no ill of sir andrew arnold here said a voic in the
crowd
onli the master of the preceptori went on acour chang hi tone
somewhat might take fright and think i wish to violat hi sanctuari
if i came there with thirti spear at my back
and no fool either said the voic see that thei ar french
spear and hi is an english sanctuari
therefor continu acour i prai you deliv the letter perchanc
when we meet again master mayor he ad with a venom glanc of
hi dark ey you will have some boon to ask of me and be sure ill

then without wait for an answer for the mob of sturdi fishermen
mani of whom had serv in the french war look threaten he
and hi follow rode awai through the ipswich gate and out on to the
moorland beyond which some of them knew but too well
all the rest of that dai thei rode slowli but when night came have
halt their hors at a farm and given it out that thei meant to push
on to woodbridg thei turn up a bytrack on the lone heath and
unseen by ani made their through the dark to a certain empti hous
in the marsh not far from beccl town thi hous call frog hall
wa part of acour estat and becaus of the agu preval there in
autumn had been long unattend nor did ani visit it at thi season of
the year when no cattl graze upon these salt marsh
here then he and hi peopl lai hid curs their fortun sinc
notwithstand the provis that thei had convei thither in secret
the place wa ici cold in the bitter easterli wind which tore over
it from the sea so lone wa it also that the frenchmen swore that
their comrad slain by grei dick haunt them at night bid them
prepar to join the number of the dead inde had not acour vow that
he would hang the first man who attempt to desert some of them would
have left him to make the best of their wai back to franc for alwai
as thei crouch by the smoke hearth thei dream of grei dick and hi
terribl arrow
sir edmund acour letter came safe into the hand of ev brought to
her by the mayor himself it read thu
ladi

will have no more of you i go hang your merchant lout and afterward
awai to franc who wish to have done with your cold suffolk where you

chanc to escap me i counsel you to marri him for i can wish you no
wors fate see what you will be than to rememb what you might
have been meanwhil it is my duti as a christian to tell you in case
you should desir to speak to him er it be too late that your father

the slai of hi son and your cruel desert of him and call for
you in hi rave mai god forgiv you as i try to do all the evil
that you have wrought which perhap is not done with yet unless fate

read
a fair grecian daughter over whom nation fought when the world wa
young becaus of her beauti
ah well she did not make herself beauti did she and perchanc

a long while so let her rest if rest she mai and now it seem that
acour is awai and that my father li veri sick what shall i do return
to him
first i will make sure that the frenchman ha gone and then we will
see daughter
so sir andrew sent out messeng who report it to be true that acour
had ridden straight to london to see the king and then sail for dover
also thei said that no frenchmen were left at blythburgh save those who
would never leav the place again and that sir john claver lai sick
in hi bed at the manor
god fight for us said sir andrew with a littl laugh thi acour
greet at court mai be warmer than he think and at the least you and
dunwich ar well rid of him though i had sooner that you stai here
tomorrow daughter you shall ride to blythburgh should your father
die as i think he will er long it might griev you in the after year
to rememb that you had bid him no farewel if he recov or is harsh
with you it will be easi for you to seek sanctuari again

month gone that de noyon would live to seek the aid of priest and
potion to win a woman favour id have name him liar to hi face
what would those who have gone befor her think of thi stori i
wonder
then with a bitter laugh he turn and went about hi busi which
wa to lie to the father as he had li to the daughter onli in thi
second case he found on more will to listen and easier to deceiv
on the follow morn as it chanc ev had no relish for the food
that wa brought to her for confin in that narrow place had rob
her of her appetit also she had suffer much from grievou fear and
doubt for whatev she might sai to acour how could she be sure that
hi stori wa not true how could she be sure that her lover did not in
fact now lie dead at the headsman hand such thing often happen
when king were wroth and would not listen or perhap acour himself
had found and murder him or hire other to do the deed she did
not know and imprison here without a friend what mean had she of
come at the truth oh if onli she could escap if onli she could
speak with sir andrew for on brief minut she poor fool who had
walk into thi trap of her own will
she sent awai the food and bade the woman mell bring her milk for that
would be easi to swallow and give her susten after some hour it
came mell explain that she had been oblig to send for it to the
farmstead as none drank milk in the manorhous be thirsti ev
took the pitcher and drain it to the last drop then threw it down
sai that the vessel wa foul and made the milk tast ill
the woman did not answer onli smile a littl as she left the chamber
and ev wonder why she smile
a while later she grew veri sleepi and as it seem to her had
strang dream in her sleep she dream of her childhood when she and
hugh plai togeth upon the dunwich shore she dream of her mother
and thought dimli that she wa warn her of someth she heard
voic about her and thought that thei were call her to be free ye
and follow them readili enough or so it seem in her dream follow
them out of that hate prison for the bolt clang behind her down
stair and into the courtyard where the sun light almost blind her
and the fresh air struck her hot brow like ic then there were more
voic and peopl move to and fro and the drone of a priest prai
and a touch upon her hand from which she shrank and oh she wish that
dream were done for it wa long long it weari her and grasp her
heart with a cold clutch of fear
chapter viii
too late
it wa past three oclock on thi same dai when ev had drunk the milk
and some hour after she began to dream that hugh de cressi and hi
men safe and sound but weari halt their tire hors at the door of
the preceptori of the templar in dunwich
best go on to hi worship the mayor and serv the king writ upon
him master grumbl grei dick as thei rode up middleg street you
wast good time in a shoot bout at windsor against my will and now
youll wast more time in a talk match at dunwich and the sun grow
low and the frenchmen mai have heard and be on the wing and who can
see to lai a shaft at night
nai man answer hugh testili first i must know how she fare
the ladi ev will fare neither better nor wors for your know about
her but on with whom you should talk mai fare further for doubtless
hi spi ar out but have your wai and leav me to thank god that no
woman ever found a chanc to clog my leg perhap becaus i wa not born
an ass
it is doubt if hugh heard these pungent and practic remark for
er dick had finish speak them he wa off hi hors and hammer
at the preceptori door some while pass befor ani answer came for
sir andrew wa walk in the garden beyond the church in no happi mind
becaus of certain rumour that had reach him and the old nun agn
spy arm men and not know who thei were wa afraid to open so
it came about that fifteen minut or more went by befor at length hugh
and hi godsir stood face to face
how is ev and where why is she not with you father he burst out
on question at a time son for whose safe return i thank god i know
not how she is and she is not with me becaus she is not here she ha
return to her father at blythburgh

peac and you shall learn and as shortli as he could he told him
is that all ask hugh doubtfulli for he saw troubl in sir andrew
face

now what shall we do ask sir andrew hi face fall it is
certain that the burgess of dunwich will not draw sword in an unknown
quarrel except upon the direct order of their chief for there is no

who had just descend from an appletre which grew in the garden of a
burntout cottag here he had been engag on the twofold busi
of survei the disposit of the english armi and in gather a
pocket of fruit which remain upon the tree topmost bough

my master be squeamish would take no part therefor i went to bed
supperless becaus as i rememb you said i had not earn it still
as i dont want to fight the french with a bellyach go scrambl for

then with a quick motion he flung the appl to a distanc all save
on which he present to a tall man who stood near ad
take thi jack green in token of fellowship sinc i have noth
els to offer you i beat you at windsor didnt i when we shot a match
befor the king now show your skill and beat me and ill sai thank

you be countri born mai own to a miss or two for shame sake or
likeli still those french will have on or both of us in their bag
if all tale ar true there is such a countless host of them that we
few english shall not see the sky for arrow
dick shrug hi shoulder and wa about to answer when suddenli a
sound of shout deep and glad rose from the serri compani upon
their left then the voic of an offic wa heard call
line line the king come
anoth minut and over the crest of a littl rise appear edward of
england clad in full armour he wore a surtout embroid with the
arm of england and franc but hi helm hung at hi saddlebow that
all might see hi face he wa mount not on hi war steed but on a
small white ambl palfrei and in hi hand he bore a short baton
with him came two marshal gaili dress and a slim young man clad
from head to foot in plain black armour and wear a great rubi in hi
helm whom all knew for edward princ of wale
on he rode acknowledg the cheer of hi soldier with smile and
courtli bow till at length he pull rein just in front of the tripl
line of archer among whom were mingl some knight and menatarm
for the order of battl wa not yet fulli set just then on the plain
beneath ride from out the shelter of some tree and as thei thought
beyond the reach of arrow appear four splendid french knight and
with them a few squir there thei halt take stock it would seem
of the disposit of the english armi
who ar those that wear such fine feather ask the king
on is the lord of bazeil answer a marshal i can see the monk
upon hi crest but the blazon of the other i cannot read thei spy
upon us sire mai we salli out and take them

go for prai god we shall see them closer soon
so the french knight have stare their full turn and rode awai
slowli but on of their squir did otherwis dismount from hi
hors which he left with anoth squir to hold he ran forward a
few pace to the crest of a littl knoll thenc he made gestur of
contempt and scorn toward the english armi as he did so shout foul
word of which a few float to them in the still
now said edward if i had an archer who could reach that varlet
ill swear that hi name should not be forgotten in england but ala
it mai not be for none cam make an arrow fly true so far
instantli grei dick step forward

ride on your shaft
for on moment dick hesit such aw word seem to shake even hi
iron nerv
iv seen you do as much dick said the quiet voic of hugh de cressi
behind him still judg you
then dick ground hi heel into the turf and laid hi weight against the
bow while all men watch breathless he drew it to an arc he drew it
till the string wa level with hi ear he loos then slew round
straighten himself and stare down at the earth as he said afterward
he fear to watch that arrow
awai it sped while all men gaze high high it flew the sunlight
glint on it polish barb down it came at length and the king
mutter short but while the word pass hi lip that shaft seem
to recov itself as though by magic and again rush on he of the
foul word and gestur saw it come and turn to fly as he leapt
forward the war arrow struck him full in the small of the back just
where the spine end sever it so that he fell all of a heap like an
ox beneath the ax and lai a still and huddl shape
from all the english right who saw thi wondrou deed there went up such
a shout that their comrad to the left and rear thought for a moment
that battl had been join the king and the princ stare amaz hugh
flung hi arm about dick neck and kiss him jack green cri
no archer but a wizard mere man could not have sent a true shaft so
far

with honour or never more
it wa not yet noon when king edward spoke these word and long hour
were to go by befor the battl join inde most thought that no
blow would be struck that dai sinc it wa known that philip had slept
at abbevil whenc for a great armi the march wa somewhat long
still when all wa made readi the english sat them down in their
rank bow and helmet at side at their middai meal with appetit
and wait whatev fate might send them
in obedi to the king command hugh and grei dick had been attach
to the immedi person of the princ of wale who had about him
besid hi own knight a small band of chosen archer and anoth band
of menatarm pick for their strength and courag these soldier
were all dismount sinc the order had gone forth that knight and
squir must fight afoot everi hors have been sent to the rear for
that dai the english expect to receiv charg not to make them
thi inde would have been imposs see that all along their
front the wild welsh had labour for hour dig pit into which
hors might plung and fall
there then the princ battl sat a small forc after all perhap
twelv hundr knight and menatarm with three or four thousand
archer and to their rear as mani of the savag knifearm welsh
who fought that dai under the banner of their countri the red dragon
of merlin grei dick place wa on the extrem left of the archer
bodyguard and hugh on the extrem right of that of the menatarm
so that thei were but a few yard apart and could talk togeth from
time to time thei spoke of sundri thing but mostli of home for in
thi hour of danger through which both of them could hardli hope
to live even if on did their thought turn thither as wa but
natur
i wonder how it fare with the ladi ev said hugh with a sigh for
of her no new had come to him sinc thei had part some month befor
after he recov from the wound which claver gave him
well enough doubtless why not repli dick she is strong and
healthi she ha mani friend and servant to guard her and no enemi
there to harm her for her great foe is yonder and he nod toward
abbevil oh without doubt well enough it is she who should wonder
how it fare with us let us hope that have naught els to do she
rememb us in her prayer sinc in such a case even on woman
prayer ar worth someth for doe not a singl feather sometim
turn the scale
i think that ev would rather fight than prai answer hugh with a
smile like old sir andrew who would give half hi remain dai to
sit here with us thi afternoon well he is better where he is dick
that knave acour sent onli insol word in answer to my challeng
which i despatch to him by the knight i took and spare at caen
why should he do more master he can find plenti of wai of dy
without risk a singl combat with on whom he ha wrong and who is
therefor veri danger you rememb hi crest mastera silver swan
paint on hi shield i knew it and that is why i shot that poor fowl
just befor you kill young claver on the bank of blyth to teach
him that swan ar not proof against arrow watch for the swan crest
master when the battl join and so will i i promis you
ay ill watch said hugh grimli god help all swan that come my
wai let us prai that thi on ha not taken wing for if so i too
must learn to fly
thu thei talk of these and other thing amongst the hum of the great
camp which wa like to that of bee on a limetre in summer and
whilst thei talk the blue august sky becam suddenli overcast dens
and heavi cloud hid up it face a cold and fit wind began to blow
increas present to a gale which caus the plant standard
blazon with lion rampant and with fleursd and the pennon of a
hundr knight set here and there among the long battl line first to
flap and waver and then to stand out straight as though thei were cut of
iron
a word of command wa call from rank to rank
sheath bow it said and instantli thousand of slender point were
lift and sank again vanish into the leathern case which the
archer bore
scarc were these snug when the storm broke first fell a few heavi
drop to be follow by such a torrent that all who had cloak were
glad to wear them from the black cloud abov leapt lightn that
were succeed by the deep and solemn roll of thunder a dark fell
upon the field so great that men wonder what it might portend for
their mind were strain that which at other time would have pass
without remark now becam portent inde afterward some declar
that through it thei had seen angel or demon in the air and other
that thei had heard a voic prophesi woe and death to whom thei knew
not
it is noth but a harvest tempest said dick present as he shook
the wet from him like a dog and look to the cover of hi quiver
see the cloud break
as he spoke a singl red rai from the wester sun shot through a
rift in the sky and lai across the english host like a sword of light
whereof the point hung over the eastern plain save for thi flame
sword all els wa dark and silent also for the rain and thunder had
di awai onli thousand of crow frighten from the wood wheel
to and fro abov their black wing turn to the red of blood as
thei cross and recross that splendid path of light and their hoars
cri fill the solemn air with clamour the sight and sound were
strang nor did the thickesthead fellow crouch upon creci
fate plain ever forget them till hi dy dai
the sky clear by slow degre the multitud of crow wheel off
toward the east and vanish the sun shone out again in quiet glori
prai god the french fight us todai said hugh as he took off hi
cloak and roll it up
why master
becaus dick it is written that the rain fall on the just and the
unjust and the unjust that is the french or rather the italian whom
thei hire us these newfangl crossbow which as you know cannot be
case like our and therefor stretch their string in wet
master remark dick i did not think you had so much witthat is
sinc you fell in love for befor then you were sharp enough well you
ar right and a littl matter like that mai turn a battl not but what
i had thought of it alreadi
hugh wa about to answer with spirit when a sound of distant shout
broke upon their ear a veri mighti sound and next instant some
outpost were seen gallop in call arm arm the french the
french
suddenli there appear thousand of crossbow men in thick waver
line and behind them the point of thousand of spear whose bearer
as yet were hidden by the live screen of the italian archer ye
befor them wa the mighti host of franc glitter in the splendid
light of the wester sun which shone full into their face
the irregular line halt perhap there wa someth in the aspect
of those band of englishmen still seat in silenc on the ground with
never a hors among them that gave them paus then as though at a
word of command the genoes crossbow men set up a terrif shout
do thei think to make us run at a nois like hare said hugh
contemptu
but grei dick made no answer for alreadi hi pale ey were fix
upon the foe with a stare that hugh thought wa terribl and hi
long finger were plai with the button of hi bowcas the genoes
advanc a littl wai then again stood and shout but still the
english sat silent
a third time thei advanc and shout more loudli than befor then
began to wind up their crossbow
from somewher in the english centr rose a heavi thud sound which
wa new to war it came from the mouth of cannon now for the first
time fire on a field of battl and at the report of them the genoes
frighten fell back a littl see that the ball fell short and did
but hop toward them slowli thei took courag again and began to loos
their bolt
your right master exclaim grei dick in a fierc chuckl their
string ar wet and he point to the quarrel that like the cannon
ball struck short some within fifti pace of those who shot them so
that no man wa hurt
now came a swift command and the english rank rose to their feet
uncas their bow and strung them all as though with a singl hand a
second command and everi bow wa bent a third and with a nois that wa
half hiss and half moan thousand of arrow leapt forward forward thei
leapt and swift and terribl thei fell among the rank of the advanc
genoes ye and er ever on had found it billet it quiverm wa
hasten on it path thenoh the sunlight show it allth genoes
roll over by score their frail armour bitten through and through by
the grei english arrow by score that grew to hundr that grew
till the poor helpless men who were yet unhurt among them wail out in
their fear and after on short hesit moment surg back upon the
long line of menatarm behind
from these aros a great shout trahison trahison tuez tuez next
instant the appal sight wa seen of the chivalri of franc fall
upon their friend whose onli crime wa that their bowstr were
wet and butcher them where thei stood so aw and unexpect wa
thi spectacl that for a littl while the english archer all except

last word when there wa noth els to do it an ugli world as i
see it but there beauti in such love as thi the man for the maid
and the maid for the manpish thei want each other but the father and
the motherthei give all and take noth oh there beauti in such
love as thi so perhap god made it onli then how did he also make
creci field and calai sieg and my black bow and me the death who
draw it
the voyag to genoa wa veri long for at thi season of the year the
wind were light and for the most part contrari at length howev
hugh and dick came there safe and sound have land and bid farewel
to the captain and crew of the ship thei wait on the head of a great
trade hous with which master de cressi had deal
thi signor who could speak french gave them lodg and welcom
them well both for the sake of hugh father and becaus thei came as
messeng from the king of england on the morrow of their arriv
he took them to a great lord in author who wa call a duke thi
duke when he learn that on wa a knight and the other a captain
archer of the english armi and that thei both had fought at creci where
so mani of hi countrymenth genoes bowmenhad been slain look on
them somewhat sourli
had he known all the part thei plai in that battl in truth hi
welcom would have been rough but hugh with the guil of the serpent
told him that the brave genoes had been slain not by the english
arrow for which even with their wet string thei were quit a match
here dick who wa stand to on side grin faintli and stroke the
case of hi black bow as though to bid it keep it memori to itself
but by the cowardli french their alli inde hugh tale of that
horribl and treacher slaughter wa so move that the duke burst
into tear and swore that he would cut the throat of everi frenchman on
whom he could lai hand
after thi he began to extol the merit of the crossbow as against the
long arm of the english and hugh agre that there wa much in what he
said but grei dick who wa no courtier did not agre inde of a
sudden he broke in offer in hi bad french to fight ani crossbow
man in genoa at six score yard so that the duke might learn which wa
the better weapon but hugh trod on hi foot and explain that he meant
someth quit differ be no master of the french tongu so that
cloud pass by
the end of it wa that thi duke or doge whose name thei learn wa
simon boccanera gave them safe conduct through all hi dominion with
an order for relai of hors also he made us of them to take a letter
to the doge of venic between which town and genoa although thei hate
each other bitterli there wa at the moment some kind of hollow truce
so have drunk a cup of wine with him thei bade him farewel
next morn the hors arriv and with them two led beast to carri
their baggag in charg of a genoes guid so thei depart on their
long ride of someth over two hundr english mile which thei hope
to cover in about a week in fact it took them ten dai for the road
were veri rough and the packbeast slow onc too after thei had
enter the territori of venic thei were set on in a defil by four
thiev and might have met their end had not grei dick ey been so
sharp as it wa he saw them come and have hi bow at hand for he
did not like the look of the countri or it inhabit leap to earth
and shot two of them with as mani arrow whereon the other two ran
awai befor thei went howev thei shot also and kill a packbeast
so that the englishmen were oblig to throw awai some of their gear and
go on with the on that remain
at length on the eleventh afternoon thei saw the love citi of
venic sparkl like a cluster of jewel set upon it mani island
amid the blue water of the adriat have cross some two mile of
open water by a ferri which pli for the conveni of travel
thei enter the town through the western gate and inquir as best
thei could for now thei had no guid the genoes have left them long
befor for the hous of sir geoffrei carleon the english envoi for
a long while thei could make no on understand inde the whole place
seem to be asleep perhap becaus of the dread heat which lai
over it like a cloud and seem to burn them to the veri bone
perplex and outworn at last hugh produc a piec of gold and held it
befor a number of men who were watch them idli again explain in
french that he wish to be led to the hous of the english ambassador
the sight of the monei seem to wake their wit for two or three of
the fellow ran forward quarrel with each other till on of them
get the masteri seiz hugh tire hors by the bridl and drag
it down a side street to the bank of a broad canal
here he call someth aloud and present two men appear row
a larg flatbottom punt from a dock where it wa hidden into thi

led him to the broad balconi of the chamber and point to long line
of curiou mist which in the bright moonlight thei could see creep
toward venic from the ocean although what wind there wa appear to
be off land
those fog ar unnatur she went on at thi season of the year
there should be none and these come not from the lagoon but up from
the sea where no such vapour were ever known to rise the physician

treason i am prepar to furnish and on behalf of that most puissant
monarch i challeng him to singl combat as i am empow and
commiss to do
why should i fight the king of england bravo inquir acour in
a languid voic of those who stood about him a question at which thei
laugh
if the charg of treason is not suffici went on hugh ill add to
it on of cowardic at the battl of creci as a man here will bear me
wit and he point to dick i overcam in singl combat a knight
who wore upon hi shield the cogniz of a wolf and on hi helm a
wolf head which were the arm of sir pierr de la roch at thi
knight prayer i spare hi life for that dai we took no prison
and let him go afterward i fought with anoth knight carri the
cogniz of a white swan the arm of the count de noyon and slew
him in fair and singl fight but befor he di he told me that he bore
that armour by command of hi lord the count de noyon and that the
said count fought that dai in hi mail becaus he fear the vengeanc
of the king of england and my own thu it came about that the wolf who
fought paid the price for the swan who fled awai hid in the armour of
hi friend whom he left to die for him
there follow a great silenc for all those nobl lord and ladi
who thought littl of treason which to most of them wa a veri familiar
thing were not a littl stir by thi tale of cowardic and fals
arm the doge said
nobl cattrina you have heard the stori of the english knight what do
you answer to it
onli that it is a lie illustri like everyth els that he ha
told us repli acour with a shrug of hi broad shoulder
you said that you had a wit cavali de cressi said the doge
where is he
here answer hugh stand forward dick and tell what you saw
dick obei and in hi low rasp voic with more detail than hugh
had given set out the stori of those two combat at creci of the
spare of the wolf knight and the slai of the swan knight
what sai you now nobl cattrina ask the doge
i sai that the man li even better than hi master answer acour
coolli and all the court laugh
illustri said hugh doubtless you have some herald at your court
i prai that he mai fetch hi book and tell us what ar the arm of de
noyon and cattrina with all their colour and detail
the doge beckon to an offic in a broider tabard who with bow
without need to fetch ani book describ the crest and arm of
cattrina in full particular he ad that to hi knowledg these were
born by no other famili or man in itali franc or england
then you would know them if you saw them said hugh
certainli cavali on it i stake my reput as a herald
now while all wonder what thi talk might mean the doge and acour
most of ani although the latter grew uneasi fear he knew not what
hugh whisper to dick then dick loos the mouth of the leather sack
he carri and out of it tumbl on to the marbl floor a whole suit of
bloodstain armour
whenc came these ask hugh of dick
off the bodi of the night sir pierr de la roch whom you slew at
creci i strip him of them myself
whose crest and cogniz ar these herald ask hugh again
lift the helm and shield and hold them on high that all might see
the herald step forward and examin them
without doubt he said slowli thei ar those of the lord of
cattrina moreov he ad five year ago i limn yonder swan
upon thi veri shield with my own hand i did it as a favour to cattrina
there who said that he would trust the task to none but an artist
now the silenc grew intens so much so that the rustl of a ladi
dress sound loud in the great hall
what sai you now my lord of cattrina ask the doge
i sai that there is some mistak illustri even if there were
none he ad slowli for their own good and law purpos knight
have chang armour befor todai
there is no mistak cri hugh in a ring voic thi signor of so
mani name is a signor of mani coat also which he can chang to save
hi skin he wore that of sir pierr de la roch to protect himself from
the vengeanc of the king of england and of the english squir whom he
had wrong he took merci from the hand of that squir who as he knew
well would have shown him none had he guess the truth he left the
poor knight whom he had bribe to be hi doubl to die beneath that
same squir hand who thought him name de noyon therefor the blood
of thi de la roch is on hi head yet these ar small matter of
privat conduct and on that is greater overtop them thi fals lord
as sir edmund acour swore fealti to edward of england yet while he wa
bound by that sacr oath he plot to depos edward and to set up on
hi throne the duke of normandi
the king of england learn of that plot through me and gave me charg
to kill or captur the traitor but when we came face to face in a
consecr church where i thought it sacrileg to draw sword he who
had just done me bitter wrong stai not to answer the wrong he slunk
awai into the dark leav me fell by a treacher blow thenc
he fled to franc and stir up war against hi lieg lord under the
oriflamm of king philip now that thi banner is in the dust he ha
fled again to venic and here as i have heard brood more mischief
onc when after the sack of caen i sent him my challeng he return
to me an insol answer that he did not fight with merchant sonsh
who could take merci from the hand of a merchant son
now that for deed done a king ha made me knight and now that
thi king under hi seal and sign ha name me hi champion in your
presenc illustri and in that of all your court i challeng
cattrina again to singl combat to the death with lanc and sword and
dagger ye and i name him coward and scullion if he refus thi king
edward gage and mine and draw the gauntlet from hi left hand
hugh cast it clatter to the marbl floor at de noyon feet
a babel of talk broke out in the great hall and with it some viva
and clap of hand for hugh had spoken boldli and well moreov
the spectat read truth in hi grei ey a dark figur in priest
robeit wa that of father nichola the secretari who had brew red

is an insult that such a word should be us befor me
i accept the protest of hi excel who forgot hi nobl presenc
repli cattrina bow back see that hi king who is not a
cutthroather a titter of laughter went through the compani though
it wa evid from the frown upon hi face that the doge like the
jest illha chosen to make a knight of thi de cressi or so he sai
which will show you friend all how hard it must be to find gentlemen
in england
again the compani titter though dick grei face turn scarlet and
he bit upon hi pale lip until the blood ran
as you accept the challeng broke in the doge shortli ceas from
gibe my lord which more befit an angri woman mouth than that of
on whose life is about to be put to hazard and take up the gage of hi
grace of england
cattrina look round and bade a page who wait on hi person obei the
doge command sai

peac peac cri the doge while those present who understood
english translat dick wild word to their neighbour and cattrina
laugh mockingli at the success of hi sneer have i not said that
such word ar unseemli ah i thought it well my lord you have
brought it on yourself
for while he spoke the page a minc young man ti up with bow and

ar brave and do not swallow insult that lad whom the englishman
kick or smote or toss like a bull and he point to the poor

tell him i am much oblig and that i will fight him with the bow or
with the ax and dagger or with all three then we will see whether he

earnest prai him have noth to do with arrow thei point
out that there hi bulk would put him at a disadvantag especi in

hi most appropri weaponssinc hi adversari refus sword the
battleax with which to knock him down as he could easili do be so
strong and the dagger with which to finish him
when thi wa explain to grei dick he assent to the propos with
a kind of unholi joi that wa almost alarm to those who saw it
moreov as neither of them had gauntlet to throw down or pick up he
stretch out hi hand to seal the bargain which incauti enough
the huge halfbre swiss accept
dick grasp inde wa so firm and long that present the giant wa
observ first to move uneasili secondli to begin to danc and thirdli
to shout out with pain

the matter is he groan as dick let go that thi son of satan
ha a blacksmith vise in place of a hand and he show hi great
finger from beneath the nail of which the blood wa ooz
hi venetian companion of the guard look at them then thei look at
grei dick and gave him a wide berth also ambrosio said someth about

said as thei watch the pair pass the door that cattrina and the
giant would do well to consult a lawyer and a priest that night

ay lord but the englishman mai not give him a chanc onli fool
would go out walk in venic along after dark if thei should happen
to have enemi here and the hous is watch by the doge guard
yet on can try fortun love the brave and englishmen ar veri great
fool thei might stroll abroad to see the moon rise over the adriat
try nichola try as you never tri befor succe too lest you
and i should part compani and you never be name abbot after all
the afternoon of the dai of their recept by the doge wa well fill
for hugh and dick scarc had thei eaten with their host when the
marshal and hi offic arriv with the articl of the morrow
combat veri fulli drawn up each of which must be consid with the
help of sir geoffrei carleon lest thei should hide some trick
befor thei confirm them with their signatur not that hugh wa
overanxi about the detail as he said to sir geoffrei all he
sought wa to come face to face with hi enemi even if he had but a
club for a weapon
at length these articl were sign and the marshal depart with hi
fee for thei must be paid for as though thei were a legal document
next hugh must try variou hors from sir geoffrei stabl and choos
on of them as hi war steed for the morrow sinc the beast he had
ridden to venic wa in no condit to bear a fullarm knight in the
end he select a grei geld quiet of tempera and rather heavi
of build which it wa report had been us by it former owner in
sever tournament and there born itself handsom thi done well
or ill hi armour must be seen to and dick also such as it wa hi
lanc test and all their other weapon sharpen on a whetston that
sir geoffrei borrow for thi wa a task that grei dick would leav to
no other hand
at length all wa prepar as well as possibl in such hast and thei
went to supper with ladi carleon who now she understood that thei were
to fight for their live on the morrow wa more mourn even than she
had been on the previou night when at last she ask what thei desir
as to their funer and if thei had ani token to be sent to friend
in england hugh whose thought were alreadi sad enough could bear no
more of it so he rose sai that he would seek sir geoffrei who wa
alreadi in hi cabinet engag upon a letter to king edward descript
of these event and other busi but when thei were out of the room
he said that he must have fresh air or he would faint which wa not
strang see that heat prevail on thi night in venic of an
intens unknown there at thi season of the year
whither shall we go ask dick mop hi brow guard stand at
the door and i doubt will not let us pass
i wish to see the place where we ar to fight tomorrow answer
hugh so as to form my judgment of it if onli we mai come there
at thi moment an english lad of sir geoffrei household chanc to
pass by have come to ask as to the feed of the hors which hugh
should ride dick caught him by the arm and ask whether he could get
them out of the hous secretli so that the guard would not see them
and conduct them to the spot call the place of arm where thei
understood thei were to fight
the lad whose name wa david dai repli somewhat doubtfulli that he
could do so by a back door near the kitchen and guid them also but
that thei must protect him from the anger of sir geoffrei thi hugh
promis to do so present thei start carri their weapon but
wear no mail becaus of the intens heat although dick remind hi
master how thei had been told that thei should not ventur forth without
bodi armour
i have a sword and you have bow and ax answer hugh so well risk
it in leatherlin mail we should sure melt
so thei put on some light cloak made of black silk with hood to them
such as the venetian wore at their masqu for david knew where these
were to be found slip out quit unobserv by the kitchen door into
a littl courtyard thei pass into an unlight back street through a
postern gate whereof the lad had the kei at the end of the street thei
came to a canal where david who talk italian perfectli hail a
boat into which thei enter without excit remark for thi sharp
youth point to their cloak and told the boatman that thei were
gallant engag upon some amor adventur
on thei row down the silent lane of water through the slumbrou
citi of palac turn here turn there till soon thei lost
all knowledg of the direct in which thei head at length david
whisper to them that thei drew near the place where thei must land
everybodi seem to speak in a whisper that heavi night even the folk
gener so light of heart and quick of tongu who sat on the step
or beneath the portico of their hous gasp for air and the
passersbi on the riva or footwalk that border the canal at a
sign from david the boat turn inward and grate against the step of
a marbl quai he paid the boatman who seem to have no energi left to
disput the fare tell him in the same low voic that if he care
to wait he might perhap row them back within an hour or so then thei
climb step and enter a narrow street where there wa no canal on
either side of which stood tall hous or dark frown gatewai
just as thei step into the shadow of thi street thei heard the prow
of anoth boat grate against the marbl step behind them and caught
the faint sound of talk appar between their rower and other in
the second boat
forward sir hugh said dai a littl nervous thi part of venic
ha no good name for mani wick deed ar done here but soon we shall
be through it
so thei step out briskli and when thei were about halfwai down
the street heard other step behind them thei turn and look back
through the gloom whereon the sound of the follow step di awai
thei push on again and so unless the echo deceiv them did those
quick stealthi step then as though by common consent though no on
gave the word thei broke into a run and gain the end of the street
which thei now saw led into a larg open space lit by the light of
the great moon that broke suddenli through the veil of cloud or mist
again as though by common consent thei wheel round hugh draw
hi sword and perceiv emerg from the street six or seven cloak
fellow who on catch sight of the flash of steel halt and melt
back into the gloom
who follow us so fast ask hugh
thiev i think answer david even more nervous than befor
ad but if so we ar safe from them here
ye sure enough said grei dick for i can shoot by moonlight and
draw the black bow from it case which he threw to the lad to carri
he strung it after which thei saw no more of their pursuer
have wait a while thei began to examin the spot where thei found
themselv which dai told them wa that place of arm where thei must
fight on the morrow it wa larg and level have been us as a
drill ground for gener perhap it measur four hundr yard
squar and almost in the centr of it rose a stand of paint timber
roof with canva and ornament with gild flagstaff from which
hung banner on thi stand david said the doge and nobl would take
their seat to see the frai for in front of it the charg knight
must meet
thei walk up and down the cours take note of everyth and
especi of how the sun would shine upon them and the foothold of the
soil which appear to be form of fine trodden sand
i ask no better ground to fight on said hugh at length though it is
strang to think he ad with a sigh that here within a dozen hour
or so two men must bid the world farewel
ay answer dick who alon seem untouch by the melancholi of
that night here will die the knave with three name and the big fool
of a halfbr swiss and descend to greet their ancestor in a place
that is even hotter than thi venic with but a sorri tale to tell
them by st georg i wish it were nine of the clock tomorrow
brag not dick said hugh with a sad smile for war is an uncertain
game and who know which of us will be talk with hi ancestor and
prai the merci of hi maker by thi time tomorrow night
then have learn all thei could thei walk across the ground to
the quai that border it on the seaward side here as thei guess
from the stone pillar to which ship were made fast wa on of the
harbour of venic although as it happen none lai at that quai thi
night yet as thei look thei saw on come in watch curious by
group of men gather on the wall
never knew i vessel make harbour in such a fashion exclaim dick
present see she sail stern first
hugh studi her and saw that she wa a great deck gallei of mani
oar such as the venetian us in trade to the east highbow and
poop but the strang thing wa that none work these oar which
although thei were lash swung to and fro aimlessli some yet whole
and some with their blade broken off and their shaft bundl of jag
splinter certain sail were still set on the ship mast in tatter
for the most part though a few remain sound and it wa by these that
she move for with the moonris a faint wind had sprung up lastli she
show no light at peak or poop and no sound of offic command or of
boatswain whistl came from her deck onli slowli and yet as though of
set purpos she drift in toward the quai
those who watch her sailor such as ever linger about harbour
seek their bread from the water though among these were mingl
peopl from the town who had come to thi open place to escap the heat
began to talk togeth affrightedli but alwai in the dread whisper
that wa the voic of thi fear knight ye even the hoarsethro
sailormen whisper like a dy woman
she no ship said on she the wraith of a ship when i wa a lad
i saw such a craft in the indian sea and afterward we founder and i
and the cook mate alon were save
pshaw answer anoth she a ship right enough look at the weed
and barnacl on her side when she heav onli where in christ name
ar her crew
ye said a third and how could she win through all the secret
channel without a pilot
what us would be a pilot said a fourth if there ar none to work
the rudder and shift the sail do i not know who am of the trade
at least she is come straight to the quai exclaim a fifth
though what send her satan alon know for the tide is slack and
thi wind would scarc move a spong boat stand by with the hawser or
shell swing round and stave herself against the pier
so thei talk and all the while the great gallei drift onward with
a slow majest motion her deck hid in shadow for a sail cut off the
light of the low moon from them present too even thi wa gone
for the veil of cloud crept again over the moon face obscur
everyth
then of a sudden a meteor blaze out in the sky such a meteor as no
live man had ever seen in venic for the size of it wa that of the
sun it seem to rise out of the ocean to the east and to travel veri
slowli across the whole arc of the firmament till at last it burst with
a terribl nois over the citi and vanish while it shone the light
it gave wa that of middai onli pale blue in colour turn all it
touch to a livid and unnatur white
it show the placid sea and fish leap on it silver face halfamil
or more awai it show the distant land with everi rock and hous and
bush it show the wharf and the watcher on it among them hugh note
a man embrac hi sweetheart as he thought under cover of the cloud
but most of all it show that gallei down to her last rope and even the
line of caulk on her deck oh and now thei saw the rower for thei
lai in heap about the oar some of them even hung over these limpli
move to and fro as thei swung while other were stretch upon
the bench as though thei slept thei were deadal dead the wind
follow the meteor and blow straight on shore told them that thei
were certainli all dead three hundr men and more upon that great
ship and all dead
nai not all for now on the high poop stood a singl figur who seem
to wear a strang red headdress and about hi shoulder a black robe
straight and silent he stood a veri fear figur and in hi hand a
coil of rope the sight of him sent those watcher mad thei ceas from
their whisper thei rave aloud
it is satan thei shout satan who come to drag the folk of
venic down to hell kill him er he land kill him
even grei dick went mad like a dog when he meet a ghost hi pale hair
rose upon hi head hi cold quiet ey start he set an arrow on the
string of the black bow drew it to hi ear and loos at the figur on
the poop but that arrow never left the string it shatter to flinder
where it wa and fell tinkl to the marbl floor onli the barb of
it turn and wound grei dick in the chin ye and stuck there for a
while for hi right arm wa numb so that he could not lift hi hand
to pull it forth
truli i have shot at the fiend and hit that at which i did not aim
mutter grei dick and sat himself down on a post of the quai to
consid the matter onli as it seem to him he who stood on the poop
of the ship not ten yard awai smile a littl
unheed of the clamour thi man upon the poop suddenli lift the
coil of rope and threw it shoreward it wa a thick and heavi rope
with a noos at it end so heavi that none would have believ that on
mortal could handl it yet it shot from him till it stood out stiff as
an iron bar ye and the noos fell over on of the stone post on the
quai and caught there now the rope grew straighter still stretch
and groan like a thing in pain as it took the weight of the great
drift ship she stai she swung round slowli and rang herself
broadsid on against the quai as a berth ship doe then down the
ladder on her side came the man deliber he set hi whitesandal
feet upon the quai advanc a few pace into the full light of the
bright moon and stood still as though to suffer himself to be seen of
everi ey
truli he wa worth the see hugh note hi garment first and
particularli the headdress which caught hi glanc and held it for
never had he known such a on befor it wa a cap fit tight to the
skull onli run across the crown of it wa a stiff rais ridg of
leather perhap jag and point someth like the comb of a cock
thi comb of brilliant red wa surmount at it highest point by a
ball of black of the size of a small appl the cap itself wa yellow
except it lowest band which stood out from it and wa also black in
the centr of thi band upon the forehead glow a stone like a rubi
such wa the headdress the broad shoulder beneath were cover with a
cape of long and glossi fur blacker than coal on to either shoulder
of which droop ear made of ring of green stone which afterward
hugh came to know wa jade the cape of fur which hung down to the
knee and wa set over a kind of surplic of yellow silk wa open in
front reveal it wearer nake bosom that wa cloth onli with row
upon row of round gem of the size of a hazel nut these like the fur
were black but shone with a strang and lustrou sheen the man thick
arm were nake but on hi hand he wore white leather glove made
without divis like a sock as though to match the white sandal on
hi feet
thi wa the man attir now for him who wore it he wa tall but not
taller than ar mani other men he wa broad but not broader than mani
other men and yet he look stronger than all the men in the world on
hi brow which wa promin smooth black hair part in the middl
wa plaster back as that of women sometim is make hard line
against the yellow skin below he had veri thin eyebrow that ran upward
on either side of a bowshap wrinkl in the centr of hi forehead
the ey beneath were small and palepal even than those of grei
dickyet their glanc wa like the point of thrust sword
with those littl ey alon he seem to smile for the rest of hi
counten did not move the nose wa long and broad at the end with
wide spread nostril and a deep furrow on either side the mouth wa
thinlip and turn downward at the corner and the chin wa like a
piec of iron quit hairless and lean as that of a man long dead
there he stood like some wild vision of a dream smile with those
small unblink ey that seem to take in all present on by on
there he stood in the moonlit silenc for the mob wa quiet enough now
for a littl while that yet wa not silenc becaus of a sough nois
which seem to proce from the air about hi head
then suddenli the tumult broke out again with it cri of kill the
devil tear the wizard to piec death is behind him he bring death
kill kill kill
a score of knive flash in the air onli thi time grei dick set no
arrow on hi string their holder ran forward then the man lift hi
hand in which wa no weapon and thei stop
now he spoke in a low voic so cold that to hugh excit fanci the
word seem to tinkl like fall ic as on by on thei came from
hi lip he spoke in italianperfect italian of veniceand young dai
whose teeth where chatter with fear translat hi word
is thi your welcom to a stranger he said the companion of whose
voyag have unhappili met with misfortun here with a faint motion of
hi fingerless glove he indic the dead who lai all about the deck
of that fatal ship would you men of venic kill a poor unarm
stranger who ha travel to visit you from the farthest east and seen
much sorrow on hi wai
ay we would sorcer shout on our brother were in that ship
which we know and you have murder them
how did you learn italian in the farthest east ask anoth
then for the second time like hound close in on a stag at bai thei
sprang toward him with their pois knive
again he lift hi hand again the semicircl halt as though it
must and again he spoke
ar there none here who will befriend a stranger in a strang land
none who ar asham to see a poor unarm stranger from the east
done to death by these wolv who call themselv children of the white
christ of merci
now hugh touch dick upon the shoulder
rise and come he said it is our fate and dick obei
onli after he had translat the man word david fell down flat upon
the quai and lai there
thei step to the yellowcap man and stood on each side of him
hugh draw hi sword and dick the battleax that he carri beneath
hi robe of silk
we will said hugh shortli in english
now there ar three of us went on the man the stranger from the
east ha found defend from the west on defend for i do not
fight thu and he fold hi arm across hi broad breast and smile
with the aw ey
hugh and dick knew no italian yet thei both of them understood and
with a shout leap forward toward those hungri knive but their
holder never wait for them some sudden panic seiz them all so
that thei turn and ranran straight across the wide place of arm and
vanish into the network of narrow street by which it wa surround
chapter xiii
murgh arrow
hugh and dick came back someth seem to call them back although no
blow had been struck the man stood where thei had left him stare at
noth in particular appar he wa engag in medit
thank hi god becaus thei have save him from sudden death
mutter grei dick if he got ani god he ad doubtfulli
now the three or rather the four of them for david dai had recov

stranger costum with a frighten ey were left alon upon the great
place with no compani save the ship of dead behind them and the wild
white moon abov the silenc that save for the sough sound for
which thei could not account wa intens oppress them as also did
the heat
grei dick cough but the man took no notic then he drop hi
ax with a clatter on the marbl floor of the quai and pick it
up again but still the man took no notic evid hi eastern
imperturb wa not to be disturb by such trifl what wa
wors or so thought dick hi master hugh had fallen into a veri
similar mood he stood there stare at the man while the man stare
over or through himat noth in particular
grei dick felt aggriev an arrow had burst to piec unaccount in
hi bow numb hi arm and wound him on the chin and now he wa
outpac at hi own game of cold silenc he grew angri and dug david in
the rib with hi elbow

useless why then wast breath which wa probabl hi last
everybodi seem to be fall into medit again when the man
shift hi head slowli began to consid hugh

dove on line black and the other line white stretch from hi right
shoulder and from hi left shoulder till mile awai thei melt into
the lofti gloom of the sky that wa full of the sough sound of their
wing

dick who sat upon the pillar of stone
hugh mutter i thank you not know what els to sai but in hi
heart he wonder what kind of friendship thi mighti and aw be

master here bade farewel to hi father in the ship at calai what were
the word oh i rememb them you wonder how on i mai not name
and he bow hi solemn head came to make that black bow and your and
you the death that draw it
now at length grei dick courag gave out
of no man upon earth am i afraid he said but from you o god or
devil who read the secret heart of men and hear their secret word my
blood flow backward as it did when first my ey fell on you you would
kill me becaus i dare to shoot at you well kill but do not tortur
it is unworthi of a knight even if he took hi accolad in hell and
he place hi hand befor hi ey and stood befor him with bent head
wait for the end
why give me such high name richard the fatherless when you have
heard two humbler on call me murgh as do my friend or call me the
gate as do those who as yet know me less well but talk not of god or
devil lest suddenli on of them should answer you nai man have no

dick although he had never suffer live man to shoot with it befor
hand him the black bow and with it a war shaft which he drew from
hi quiver
tell me archer dick have you ani enemi in thi town of venic
becaus if so we might try a shot at him
on or two gate murgh answer dick still whatev your half of me
mai do my bit of you doe not love to strike down men by magic in the
dark
well said and better thought then bethink you of someth that
belong to an enemi which will serv as well for a test of shoot ah
i thank you well thought again ye i see the mark though ti far
is it not now set your mind on it but stai first will you know thi
arrow again
sure answer dick i made it myself moreov though two of
the feather ar black the third is white with four black spot and a
littl splash of brown look on it sir hugh it cannot be mistook
hugh look and nod speak he could not for the life of him
then murgh began to plai a littl with the bow and oh strang and
dread wa the music that came from it string beneath the touch of
hi glove finger it sang like a harp and wail like a woman so
fearfulli inde that the lad dai who all thi while stood by aghast
stop hi ear with hi finger and hugh groan then thi aw
archer swiftli set the arrow on the string
now think with your mind and shoot with your heart he said in hi
cold voic and so sai drew and loos as though at a hazard
out toward venic leap the shaft with a rush sound like to that
of wing and as it seem to the watcher light went with it for
it travel like a beam of light far over the citi it travel
describ a mighti arc such as no arrow ever flew befor then sank
down and vanish behind some palac tower
a veri good bow said the shooter as he hand it back to dick
never have i us a better who have us thousand made of mani a
substanc inde i think that i rememb it did you chanc to find it
year ago by the seashor ye well it wa a gift of mine to a famou
archer who di upon a ship nai it is not strain i can judg of the
break strength of a bow whether or no i can judg of the flight of
an arrow you will learn hereaft but that thi on flew fast and far
cannot be doubt sincedid you watcher note itit speed made it
shine like fire thi is caus by the rub of the air when aught
travel through it veri quickli thi night you have seen a meteor glow
in the same fashion onli becaus the air fret it in it passag
in the east whenc i come we produc fire just so and now let us be
go for i have much to do tonight and would look upon thi fair
venic er i sleep ill lead the wai have seen a map of the town
which a travel brought to the east i studi it and now it come
back to my mind stai let that youth give me hi garment and he
point to david dai who wore a silk cloak like the other sinc my
foreign dress might excit remark as it did but now
in a moment dai had strip himself of hi light silkhood gown
and in anoth moment it wa on the person of murgh though how it got
there when thei came to think of it afterward none could rememb
still the yellow and red headdress the coalblack silki fur the
yellow skirt the gleam pearl all vanish beneath it noth
remain visibl except the white fingerless gloveswhi were thei
fingerless and what lai beneath them hugh wonderedand the white
shoe
forward thei went across the place of arm past the timber stand
ornament with banner which murgh stai to contempl for an
instant until thei came to the mouth of the street up which men had
follow them appar with evil intent
sir murgh said hugh step forward you had best let me and my
companion grei dick walk first down thi place lest you should come
to harm when we pass it a while ago we thought that we heard robber
behind us and in venic as we ar told such men us knive
thank you for your warn sir hugh and even beneath the shadow
of the silk hood hugh thought that he saw hi ey smile and see
rememb all the folli of such talk
yet ill risk these robber do you two and the lad keep behind me he
ad in a sterner voic
so thei advanc down the narrow street the man call murgh go
first hugh grei dick and the lad follow meekli behind him as thei
enter it shadow a low whistl sound but noth happen for a
while when thei had travers about half it length howev men five
or six of them in all dart out of the gloom of a gatewai and rush
at them the faint light show that thei were mask and gleam upon
the blue steel of the dagger in their hand two of these men struck at
murgh with their knive while the other tri to pass him doubtless
to attack hi companion but fail why thei fail hugh and dick
never knew all thei saw wa that murgh stretch out hi whiteglov
hand and thei fell back
the men who had struck at him fell back also their dagger drop to
the ground and fled awai follow by their companion all except on
whom murgh had seiz hugh note that he wa a tall thin fellow and
that unlik the rest he had drawn no weapon although it wa at hi
signal that the other bravo had rush on thi man murgh seem to
hold with on hand while with the other he rip the mask off hi face
turn him so that the light shone on him
hugh and dick saw the face and knew it for that of the priest who had
accompani acour to england it wa he who had drug red ev and read
the mass of marriag over her while she wa drug
who ar you ask murgh in hi light cold voic by your shaven
head a priest i thinkon who serv some god of love and merci and
yet you come upon thi ill errand as a captain of assassin why do you
seek to do murder o priest of the god of merci
now some power seem to drag the answer from father nichola
becaus i must he said i have sold myself and must pai the price
step lead to step and he who run mai not stop upon them
no priest nichola sinc ever thei grow more narrow and more steep
yet at the foot of them is the dark abyss and murder nichola you
have reach the last of all your step look at me and with on hand
he threw back the hood
next instant thei saw nichola rush stagger down the street
scream with terror as he went then as all the bravo had gone
thei continu their march fill with reflect till thei came
to the littl landingstag where thei had left the boat it wa still
there though the boatman had gone
let us borrow thi boat said murgh as from my studi of the map i
know these waterpath i will be steersman and that tongueti lad
shall row and tell me if i go wrong first i will take you to the hous
where i think you said you lodg and thenc to go seek friend of my
own in thi citi who will show me hospit
thei glide on down the long canal in utter silenc that wa broken
onli by the soft dip of the oar the night wa somewhat cooler now
for the burst of the great meteor seem to have clear the air or
perhap the gentl breez that had sprung up blow from the open sea
temper it stifl heat
so it came about that although it grew late mani peopl were gather
on the riva or on the balconi of the fine hous which thei pass
for the most part doubtless discuss the travel star that had
been seen in the sky or perhap thei had alreadi heard rumour of the
strang visitor who had come to venic although howev fast such new
mai fly thi seem scarc probabl at the least there thei were
men and women talk earnestli togeth and about them the three
englishmen note a strang thing
as their boat slip by some influenc seem to pass from it to the
mind of all these peopl their talk di out and wa succeed by
a morn and heavi silenc thei look at it as though wonder why
a sight so usual should draw their ey then after a few irresolut
moment the group on the footpath separ and went their wai
without bid each other good night as thei went mani of them made
the sign with their finger that these italian believ could avert
evil which gave them the appear of all point at the boat or it
occup those in the balconi did the same thing and disappear
through the open windowplac
more than ani of the wonder thing that he had done perhap thi
effect of the eastern stranger presenc struck terror and forebod
to hugh heart
at length thei came to the end of that littl street where thei had
hire the boat for although none had told him the wai thither their
dread steersman brought them without fault the lad david laid down
hi oar and mount the step that led to the street which wa quit
desert even the border hous be in dark
hugh de cressi and richard the fatherless said murgh you have seen
wonder thing thi night and made a strang friend as you mai think
by chanc although truli in all the wide univers there is no room for
such a thing as chanc now my counsel to you and your companion is
that you speak no word of these matter lest you should be set upon as
wizard we part but we shall meet again twice more and after mani
year a third time but that third meet do not seek for it will be
when the last grain of sand ar run from the glass also you mai
see me at other time but if so unless i speak to you do not speak
to me now go your wai fear noth howev great mai seem your
peril i sai to youfear noth soon you will hear ill thing spoken
of me yetand here a touch of human wist came into hi inhuman
voicei prai you believ them not when i am name murgh the fiend
and murgh the sword then think of me as murgh the helper what i do is
decre by that which is greater than i and if you could understand it
lead by terribl wai to a goal of good as all thing do richard the
archer i will answer the riddl that you ask yourself upon the ship
at calai the strength which made your black bow an instrument of doom
made you who loos it shaft and me who can outshoot you far as the
arrow travel whither it is sent and there doe it appoint work so
do you travel and so do i and mani anoth thing seen and unseen and
therefor i told you truli that although we differ in degre yet we ar
on ye even murgh the eat fire murgh the gate and that bent wand
of your ar on in the hand that shape and hold us both
then divest himself of the long robe which he had borrow from the
lad he hand it to hugh and take the oar row awai clad in hi
rich fantast garb which now as at first could be seen by all he
row awai and for a while the three whom he had left behind heard the
sough of the innumer wing that went ever with him after which
came silenc
silenc but not for long for present from the border of the great
canal into which hi skiff must enter rose shout of fear and rage
near by at first then farther and farther off till these too were lost
in silenc
oh sir hugh sob poor david dai who and what is that dread
man
i think hi name is death answer hugh solemnli while dick nod
hi head but said noth
then we must die went on david in hi terror and i am not fit to
die
i think not said hugh again be comfort death ha pass us by
onli be warn also and as he bade you sai noth of all that you
have heard and seen
by death himself ill sai noth for my life sake he repli
faintli for he wa shake in everi limb
then thei walk up the street to the yard door as thei went hugh ask
dick what it wa that he had in hi mind as a mark for the arrow that
murgh had shot that arrow which to hi charm sight had seem to rush
over venic like a flake of fire
ill not tell you master answer dick lest you should think me
madder than i am which tonight would be veri mad inde stai though
ill tell david here that he mai be a wit to my folli and he
call the young man to him and spoke with him apart
then thei unlock the courtyard gate and enter the hous by the
kitchen door as it chanc quit unobserv for now all the servant
were ab inde of that household none ever knew that thei had been
outsid it wall thi night sinc no on saw them go or return
and sir geoffrei and hi ladi thought that thei had retir to their
chamber
thei came to the door of their room david still with them for the
place where he slept wa at the end of thi same passag
bide here a while said dick to him my master and i mai have a word
to sai to you present
then thei lit taper from a littl roman lamp that burn all night
in the passag and enter the room dick walk at onc to the
windowplac look and laugh a littl
the arrow ha miss he said or rather he ad doubtfulli the
target is gone
what target ask hugh wearili for now he desir sleep more than
he had ever done in all hi life then he turn the taper in hi hand
and start back suddenli point to someth which hung upon hi
bedpost that stood opposit to the window
who nail hi helm upon my bed he said is thi a challeng from
some knight of venic
dick step forward and look
an omen not a challeng i think come and see for yourself he said
thi is what hugh saw fix to the post by a shaft which pierc it
and the carv olivewood from side to side wa the helm that thei had
strip from the bodi of sir pierr de la roch the helm of sir edmund
acour which sir pierr had worn at creci and dick had tumbl out of
hi sack in the presenc of the doge befor cattrina face on hi
return to the hous of sir geoffrei carleon he had set it down in the
centr of the open windowplac and left it there when thei went out to
survei the ground where thei must fight upon the morrow
have studi it for a moment dick went to the door and call to
david
friend he said stand between him and the bed so that he could
see noth what wa it that just now i told you wa in my mind when
yonder murgh ask me at what target he should shoot with my bow on the
place of arm
a knight helm answer david which stood in the window of your
room at the ambassador housea knight helmet that had a swan for
it crest
you hear said dick to hugh now come both of you and see what is
that which hang upon the bedpost answer you david for perchanc my
sight is bewitch
a knight helm answer david bear the crest of a float swan
and held there by an arrow which ha pierc it through
what wa the arrow like which i gave thi night to on murgh master
ask dick again

chequer with four black spot and a smear of brown answer hugh
then is that the same arrow master which thi murgh loos from more
than a mile awai
hugh examin it with care thrice he examin it point and shaft and
feather then in a low voic he answer
ye
chapter xiv
at the place of arm
notwithstand all that ha been told hugh and dick never slept more
soundli than thei did that night nor wa their rest broken by ani
dream at half past five in the morningfor thei must be stir
earlydavid came to call them he too it seem had slept well also
in the light of dai the worst of hi fear had left him
i am wonder sir hugh he said look at him curious whether
i saw certain thing last night down yonder at the place of arm and in
the boat or whether i thought i saw them
doubtless you thought you saw them david answer hugh ad with
mean and it is not alwai well to talk of thing we think that we
have seen
the lad who wa sharp enough nod but as he turn to hand hugh
some garment hi ey fell upon the swancrest helm that wa still
nail by the long warshaft with two black feather and on white to
the carv olivewood post of the bed
it must have been a mighti arm that shot thi arrow sir hugh he said
reflect which could pierc a casqu of milan steel from side to
side and a hardwood post beyond well for the owner of the helm that hi
head wa not insid of it
veri well and a veri mighti arm david so mighti that i should sai
noth about it for fear lest it should set anoth arrow upon anoth
string and shoot again
god truth not i exclaim david and for your comfort sir know
that none saw us leav thi hous or renter it last night
then hugh and dick cloth themselv and saw to their weapon and mail
but thi thei did not don as yet fear lest the weight of it should
weari them in that great heat although the dai wa so young thi heat
wa terribl more oppress inde than ani thei had yet known in
venic
when thei were readi david left them to see to the hors which de cressi
would ride in hi combat with cattrina hugh as becam a godfear
knight whom sir andrew arnold had instruct from childhood cross
himself knelt down and said hi prayer which that morn were long
and earnest inde he would have confess himself also if he could
onli there wa no priest at hand who knew hi languag sir geoffrei
chaplain be awai after watch him a while even grei dick whose
prayer were few follow hi exampl kneel in front of hi bow as
though it were an imag that he worship when thei had risen again
he said
you griev that there is none to shrive us master but i hold
otherwis sinc when it wa told what compani we kept last night
absolut might be lack thi would weigh on you if not on me who
after what i have learn of father nichola and other love but on
priest and he far awai
yet it is well to have the bless of holi church er such a busi
as our dick that is if it can be come by
mayhap master but for my part i am content with that of murgh which
he gave us you mai rememb or so i understood him moreov did he
not teach that he and all ar but minist of him abov therefor i go
straight to the head of the stair and he nod toward the sky i am
content to skip all those step which ar call priest and altar and
pope and saint and suchlik folk live or dead if murgh wisdom
be true as i think these ar but garnish to the dish which can
well be spare by the hungri soul
that mai be hugh answer dubious for hi faith in such matter
wa that of hi time yet were i you dick id not preach that
philosophi too loud lest the priest and pope should have someth to
sai to it the saint also for aught i know sinc i have alwai heard
that thei love not to be left out of our account with heaven
well if so answer dick ill quot st murgh to them who is a
veri fit patron for an archer then onc again he glanc at the
helm and the arrow with someth not unlik fear in hi cold ey
present thei went down to the eat chamber where thei had been told
that breakfast would be readi for them at seven of the clock there thei
found sir geoffrei await them
i trust that you have slept well sir hugh he said you were a wise
knight to go to rest so earli have befor you such a trial of your
strength and manhood and so to speak the honour of our king upon your
hand
veri well inde thank you sir answer hugh and you
oh ill extrem ill i do not know what is the matter with me or
venic either whereof the veri air seem poison feel the heat and
see the haze it is most unnatur moreov although in your bed
doubtless you saw it not a great ball of fire blaze and burnt over the
citi last night so bright wa it that even in a darken room each of
us could see the colour of the other ey later too as i watch at
the window there came a thin streak of flame that seem to alight on
or about thi veri hous inde i thought i heard a sound as of iron
strike upon iron but could find no caus for it
wondrou happen sir said grei dick glad am i that we were not
with you lest the sight of them should have made us fear on thi
morn of combat
wondrou happen inde friend richard said sir geoffrei
excitedli but you have not heard the half of them the herald who ha
just been here with the final articl of your frai sign by the doge
and cattrina ha told me much that i can scarc believ he sai that
the great gallei from thi port which is call light of the east
drift up to the quai at the place of arm last night on her return
voyag from cypru fill with dead and with no live thing aboard her
save the devil himself in a yellow robe and a manyhu headdress like
a cockscomb with a red ey he swear that thi fiend land and that
the mob set on him whereon two some sai three other devil clad in
long black gown appear out of the water and drove them back also
it seem that thi same cockscomb satan stole a boat and row about
the citi afterward but now none can find him although thei have got
the boat
then thei should be well satisfi said hugh sinc it owner ha
lost noth but the hire which with satan at the oar is better than
might be hope perhap he wa not there after all sir geoffrei
i know not but at least the gallei light of the east is there for
ever sinc the dawn thei have been take the dead out of her to buri
them of these thei sai thing too terribl to repeat for no doctor can
tell of what sick thei di never have seen it like for my part
i prai it mai not be catch were i the doge i would have tow her
out to sea and scuttl her cargo and all well well enough of these

straight
hugh lean against a marbl pillar in the hall and look at hi
hostess helplessli while sir geoffrei catch her drift at length
broke in
ceas such illomen talk wife think you that it is of a kind to
give brave men a stomach in a fight to the end

then have utter thi grim jest dick took hi master by the arm and
drew him through the door
afterward for a reason that shall be told he wa sorri that it had
ever pass hi lip still in the boat sir geoffrei applaud him
sai that hi ladi melancholi had grown beyond all bear and that
she did littl but prate to him about hi will and what colour of marbl
he desir for hi tomb
after a journei that seem long to hugh who wish to have thi
busi over thei came to the place of arm their rout there
howev wa not the same which thei had follow on the previou night
leav the short wai through the low part of the town untravers thei
row from on of the canal into the harbour itself where thei were
join by mani other boat which wait for them and so on to the quai
hugh saw at onc that the death ship light of the east wa gone and
incauti said as much to sir geoffrei
ye he answer on of my rower tell me that thei have tow her
to an island out at sea sinc the stench from her hold wa more than
could be born but how did you know that she lai at thi particular
quai sir hugh
i thought you said so he answer carelessli ad to chang the
subject look our frai will not lack for spectat and he point
to the thousand gather upon the great tiltingground
no no all venic will be there for these peopl love a show
especi if there be death in it
mayhap thei will see more of him than thei wish befor all is done
mutter grei dick paus from the task of whet hi ax edg
with a littl stone which he carri in hi pouch then he replac the
ax in it hanger and draw hugh sword from it sheath began to
give some final touch to it razor edg sai father sir andrew
arnold bless it which should be enough but milan steel is hard and
hi old battl blade will bite none the wors for an extra sharpen
go for hi throat master go for hi throat the mail is alwai
thinnest there
god abov us what a grim man exclaim sir geoffrei and so thought
all in that boat and in those around them at least thei look at dick
askanc as he whet and whet and then pluck out on of the
pale hair from hi head drew it along the edg of the steel which
sever it in twain
there thatll do said grei dick cheerfulli as he return the long
sword to it sheath and god help thi cattrina i sai for he come
to hi last battl that is unless he run awai he ad after
reflect
now thei land and were receiv by herald blow trumpet and
conduct through a great multitud of peopl with much pomp and
ceremoni to a pavilion which had been pitch for them where thei must
arm and make readi
thi then thei did help or hinder by bow squir whose languag
thei could not understand
at length when it lack but a quarter to the hour of nine david dai
led hugh hors into the wide entranc of the pavilion where thei
examin it armour bridl sell and trap
the beast sweat alreadi said hugh and so do i who to tell truth
dread thi heat more than cattrina sword prai that thei get to the
busi quickli or i shall melt like butter on a hot plate
then hi lanc wa given to him a lanc that wa sharp and strong
when thei had been test by them both hugh mount the grei and at the
agre signal of a singl blast upon a trumpet walk it slowli from
the pavilion dick go at hi side on foot
at their come a shout went up from the assembl thousand for in
truth it seem as sir geoffrei had said as though all the folk in
venic were gather on that place when thei had finish shout the
peopl began to criticis find much in the appear of thi pair
that move their readi wit inde there wa littl show about them for
hugh plain armour which lack all ornament or inlai wa worn with
war and travel and hi hors came along as soberli as if it were go
out to plough nor wa there anyth fine about the apparel of grei
dick who wore a loos chain shirt much out of fashionit wa that
which sir andrew had given to hughan iron cap with earpiec and
leather buskin on hi leg in hi hand wa hi ax heavi but not
over larg at hi side hung a great knife and on hi back wa the long
black bow and a quiver of arrow
thu arrai take no heed of the jest and chatter of the multitud
thei were led to the front of the bedeck timber stand which thei had
seen on the previou night in the centr of thi stand occupi a
kind of tribun sat the doge dandolo in state and with him mani nobl
and captain while to right and left the whole length of the cours
for the stand wa veri long were pack a countless number of the
bestborn men and women in venic these howev were but a tith of
the spectat who encircl the place of arm in on serri hord
which wa kept back by a line of soldier
arriv in front of the doge tribun the pair halt and salut
him whereon he and hi escort rose and salut them in turn then
anoth trumpet blew and from a second pavilion at the other end of
the cours appear cattrina wear a splendid suit of white armour
damascen in gold with a silver swan upon the helm and a swan paint
on hi shield
veri fine isnt it said grei dick to hi master onli thi time
i hope he insid the steel ask to see hi face befor you fight
master
on came cattrina on a nobl black hors which paw and caracol
notwithstand the heat while after him strode a gigant figur
also clad from top to toe in white mail who fierc brandish a
longhandl battleax
ambrosio said dick now i ought to feel as much afraid as though
that fellow wore a yellow cap and fur cape and pearl like anoth
warrior whom we met last night yet to speak the truth i believ he
ha the fainter heart of the two also if he swing that chopper about
so much hell grow tire
to the multitud howev the gallant appear of thi pair whom
thei look on as the champion of venic against foreign appeal
not a littl amidst clap of hand and evviva thei advanc
to the doge tribun and there made their salut which the
illustri acknowledg as he had those of the englishmen
then the herald interven and again all the articl of combat were
read and translat although to these of which thei were weari
hugh and dick listen littl next thei were ask if thei had ani
object to make and with on voic answer none but on the same
question be put to their adversari the swiss ambrosio said that
he with whom he must fight appear to be arm with a bow which wa
against the articl thereon dick hand the bow and quiver to david
bid him guard them until he ask for them again as he would hi own
life in the event of hi death howev david wa to give them to sir
hugh or if thei both should die to hi own master sir geoffrei all
of these thing david promis to do
next follow a long discuss as to whether the four of them were
to fight in pair cattrina and ambrosio against hugh and dick
simultan or whether ambrosio wa to fight alon with dick and
cattrina with hugh upon cattrina and ambrosio be ask their wish
the former said that he desir to fight alon as he fear lest the
english archer if he overcam ambrosio should turn on him also or
perhap hamstr hi hors
then the englishmen were ask what thei wish and repli that thei
did not care how it wa arrang be readi to fight either togeth
or separ as the doge might decre
the end of it wa that after long consult with sundri expert in
such matter the most illustri decid that the captain ambrosio
and richard the archer should first engag on foot and when that
busi wa settl the two knight should take their place in the
arena
so the end of it wa that more than half an hour after the combat should
have begun dick and the gigant ambrosio found themselv stand
face to face wait for the signal to engag the swiss shout
threat and defianc and grei dick grin and watch him out of hi
halfshut ey
at length it came in the shape of a singl blast upon a trumpet now
see that dick stood quit still not even rais hi ax the swiss
advanc and struck a mighti blow at him which dick avoid by step
asid recov himself again ambrosio struck thi blow dick caught
upon hi shield then as though he were afraid began to retreat
slowli at first but afterward faster till hi walk broke into a run
at thi sight all that mighti audienc set up a hoot coward dog
pig of an englishman thei yell and the louder thei yell the more
quickli did grei dick run till at last even hugh grew puzzl wonder
what wa in hi mind and hope that he would chang it soon so the
audienc hoot and grei dick ran and the giant swiss lumber along
after him bellow triumphantli and brandish hi battleax which
it wa note never seem to be quit long enough to reach hi fly
foe
when thi had gone on for two or three minut grei dick stumbl and
fell the swiss who wa follow fast likewis trip and fell over
him heavili whereon the multitud shout
foul plai a dirti foreign trick
in an instant dick wa up again and had leapt upon the prostrat swiss
as all thought to kill him but instead the onli thing he did wa to
get behind him and kick him with hi foot until he also rose thereat
some laugh but other who had bet upon their champion groan
now the swiss have lost hi shield in hi fall rush at dick
grasp hi ax with both hand as befor the englishman avoid the
blow but for the first time he struck back catch the giant on the
shoulder though not veri heavili then with a shout of st georg and
england he went in at him
hither and thither sprang dick now out of reach of the ax of the swiss
and now beneath hi guard but ever as he sprang he deliv blow upon
blow each harder than the last till there appear scar and rent
in the fine white mail soon it becam clear that the great swiss wa
overmatch and spent he breath heavili hi stroke grew wild he
overbalanc recov himself and at last in hi turn began to fly
in good earnest
now after him went dick batter at hi back but as all might see
with the flat of hi ax not with it edg ye he wa beat him as
a man might beat a carpet beat him till he roar with pain
fight ambrosio fight dont fly shout the crowd and he tri to
wheel round onli to be knock prostrat by a singl blow upon the head
which the englishman deliv with the hammerlik back of hi ax
then dick wa seen to kneel upon him and cut the lash of hi helmet
with hi dagger doubtless to give the coup de grce or so thei
thought
our man is murder yell the common peopl while those of the
better sort remain shame and silent
dick rose and thei groan think that all wa done but lo
stoop down he help the breathless swiss whom he had disarm to
hi feet then take him by the nape of the neck which wa easi as
hi helmet wa off with on hand while in the other he held hi bare
knife dick thrust him befor him till thei reach the tribun of the
doge
be pleas to tell the illustri he said to sir geoffrei that
thi braggart have surrend i spare hi life and now return him
to hi brother the page quit unharm sinc i did not wish to wound
on who wa in my power from the first onli when he get home i prai
that he will look at hi back in a glass and judg which of us it is
that ha been beaten to a pulp let him return thank also to hi
patron saint who put piti in my heart so that i did not cut him into
collop as i promis for know sir that when i walk out yonder
it wa my purpos to hew off hi hand and shorten him at the knee
stayon word more if yonder boaster ha more brother who realli wish
to fight ill take them on by on and swear to them that thi time
ill not give back a step unless im carri
do you inde yield and accept the englishman merci ask the doge
in a stern voic
the poor ambrosio make no answer blunder forward among the crowd
and there vanish and thi wa the last that dick ever saw or heard of
him but although he wait there a while feel the edg of hi ax
and glare about him none of the captain companion came forward to
accept hi challeng
at length with a shrug of hi shoulder dick turn have taken hi
bow and quiver from david who could not conceal hi indec joi at the
utter humili of ambrosio whom he hate with a truli british hate
he walk slowli to where hugh sat upon hi hors
the jest is done master and now for good earnest sinc ti your
turn the saint save me such anoth cow hunt in thi hell heat had
i kill him at onc i should be cooler now but it came into my mind to
let the hound live inde to speak truth i thought that i heard the
voic of murgh behind me sai spare and knew that i must obei
i hope he will sai noth of the sort to me present answer hugh
if he is here which i doubt why what is it now those goldcoat
marshal ar talk again
talk thei were evid at the instanc of cattrina or hi
counsellor who had rais some new object which sir geoffrei
step forward to explain to them but hugh would not even hear him
out
tell the man and all whom it mai concern he said in an angri voic
that i am readi to fight him as he will on hors or on foot with
lanc or sword or ax or dagger or ani or all of them in mail or
without it or if it pleas him strip to the shirt onli let him
settl swiftli sinc unless the sweat run into my ey and dim them
it seem to me that night is come befor it is noon
you ar right answer sir geoffrei thi gather gloom is omin
and fear i think that some awesom tempest must be about to burst
also it seem to me that cattrina ha no stomach for thi frai els he
would not rais so mani point of martial law and custom
then wipe hi brow with a silken handkerchief he return to deliv
the messag
now hugh and dick watch saw that cattrina and those who advis him
could find no further loophol for argument thei saw moreov that
the doge grew angri for he rose in hi seat throw off hi velvet
robe of offic of which it appear that he could no longer bear the
weight and spoke in a hard voic to cattrina and hi squir next
onc more the titl of the combat were read and their caus of
combat and while thi went on hugh bade dick bind about hi right arm
a certain red ribbon that ev had given him sai that he wish to
fight wear hi ladi favour
dick obei mutter that he thought such humour foolish and that a
knight might as well wear a woman petticoat as her ribbon by now so
dim had the light grown he could scarc see to tie the knot
inde the weather wa veri strang
from the dark lower sky abov a palpabl black sank downward
as though the cloud themselv were fall of their own weight while
from the sea great roll of vapour came sweep in like wave also
thi sea itself had found a voic for although it wa so calm it
moan like a world in pain the great multitud began to murmur and
their face lift upward toward the sky grew ghastli white fear
thei knew not of what had got hold of them a voic cri shrilli
let them fight and have done we would get home er the tempest
burst
the first trumpet blew and the hors of the knight which whinni
uneasili were led to their station the second trumpet blew and the
knight laid their lanc in rest then er the third trumpet could
sound suddenli the dark of midnight swallow all the scene
dick grope hi wai to hugh side bide where you ar he said the
end of the world is here let us meet it like men and togeth
ay answer hugh and hi voic rang hollow through hi close visor
without doubt it is the end of the world and murgh the minist ha
been sent to open the door of heaven and hell god have merci on us
all
so thei stai there hearken to the groan and prayer of the
terrifi multitud about them dick hold the bridl of the hors
which shook from head to foot but never stir for some minut
thei remain thu till suddenli the sky began to lighten but with
no natur light the colour of it of the earth beneath and of the
air between wa a deep terribl red that caus all thing to seem
as though thei were dy in blood lighter and lighter and redder and
redder it grew the long stand and the pavilion becam visibl and
after them the dens deep ring of spectat mani of these were
kneel while other who could find no space to kneel held their
hand upstretch toward heaven or beat their breast and wept in the
emot fashion of the countri
yet not on them were the ey of hugh and grei dick fix but rather on
a singl figur which stood quit alon in the midst of that great
arena where cattrina and hi hors should have been where thei had been
inde but a littl while befor the figur wa cloth in a red and
yellow cap shape like a cockscomb in black fur a yellow robe and
white glove and sandal yonder it stood fantast fear it bare
and brawni arm cross upon it breast it head bow as though
it contempl the ground there wa not an ey of all the ten of
thousand of those who were present that did not see it there wa not a
voic that did not break into a yell of terror and hate till the earth
shook with such a sound as might reverber through the choke abyss of
hell
the fiend the fiend the fiend said the shout kill him kill him
kill him
the figur look up the red light shone upon it stoni face that
seem on blotch of white amidst it glow then it stoop down and
lift from the sand a knight lanc such as cattrina had held it
rais the lanc and with it point four time east and west and
north and south hold it final for a while in the direct of the
tribun where sat the doge with all hi nobl compani and of venic
beyond lastli with a quick and easi motion it cast the lanc toward
the sky whenc it fell remain fix point downward in the earth
then a tongu of mist that had crept up from the sea envelop it and
when that mist clear awai the shape wa gone
now the red haze thin and for the first time that morn the sun
shone out in a sickli fashion although their nerv were torn by the
unnatur dark and the apparit that follow it which all saw
yet none quit believ that thei had seen the multitud shout for
the combat to proce
onc more hugh laid hi lanc in rest think that cattrina wa there
although he could not see him
then the third trumpet rang outin that silenc it sound like the
blast of doomand hugh spur hi hors forward a littl wai but
halt for he could perceiv no foe advanc against him he stare
about him and at last in a rage threw hi lanc to a squir and
turn hi hors gallop to the tribun there he pull it to hi
haunch and shout out in a great voic
where is cattrina am i to be fool who appear here as the champion
of the king of england where is cattrina produc cattrina that i mai
slai him or be slain or chivalri of venic be forev shame
the doge rose utter swift command and herald ran here and there
knight and captain search the pavilion and everi other place where
a mount man might hide but thei never found cattrina and return
at length confess as much with bow head
the doge madden by thi ignomini seiz the great gold chain upon
hi beast and burst it in two
cattrina ha fled he shout or satan himself ha carri him awai
at the least let hi name be eras from the golden book of venic and
until he prove himself innoc let no nobl of venic stretch out
to him the hand of fellowship men of venic for you cattrina and hi
hous ar dead
will none take up hi caus and fight for him ask hugh through
sir geoffrei and present at the doge command the challeng
wa repeat thrice by the herald but to it no answer came of thi
afterward hugh wa glad sinc it wa cattrina life he sought not
that of ani other man then hugh spoke again sai
i claim o illustri that i be written down as victor in thi combat
to the death bloodless through no fault of mine
it shall be so written nobl hugh de cressi said the doge let all
venic take notic thereof
as the word left hi lip the solid earth began to heav and rock
at the first heav hugh leap from hi hors which scream aloud and
fled awai and grip hold of grei dick at the second the multitud
broke out into wild cri prayer and blasphemi and rush thi wai
and that at the third which came quit slowli and wa the greatest of
them all the long stand of timber bent it flag toward him as though
in salut then with a slow grind crash fell over entangl
all within it beneath it ruin also in the citi beyond hous whole
street of them gabl church and tall tower sank to the earth
while where thei had been rose up wreath column of dust to the south
the sea becam agit spout of foam appear upon it smooth face
it drew back from the land reveal the slime of ag and embed
therein longforgotten wreck it heap itself up like a mountain
then with a swift and dread motion advanc again in on vast wave
in an instant all that multitud were in full flight
hugh and dick fled like the rest and with them david though whither
thei went thei knew not
all thei knew wa that the ground leapt and quiver beneath their feet
while behind them came the horribl seeth hiss of water on the crest
of which men were toss up and down like bit of float wood
chapter xv
the death at work
present hugh halt take shelter with hi two companion behind the
stone wall of a shed that the earthquak had shatter for here thei
could not be trodden down by the mob of fugit
the wave ha spent itself he said point to the line of foam that
now retreat toward the ocean take with it mani drown or drown
men let us return and seek for sir geoffrei it will be shame if we
leav him trap yonder like a rat
dick nod and make a wide circuit to avoid the madden crowd thei
came safe to the wreck stand where thei had last seen sir geoffrei
talk with the doge everi minut inde the mob grew thinner sinc
the most of them had alreadi pass tread the life out of those who
fell as thei went
from thi stand more than three fourth of those who were seat there
had alreadi broken out sinc it had not fallen utterli and by good
fortun wa open on all side some howev tangl in the canva
roof were still try to escap other poor creatur had been crush
to death or brokenlimb lai helpless or wors still were held
down beneath the fallen beam
sever of these thei freed whereon those who were unharm at onc
ran awai without thank them but for a long while thei could find
no trace of sir geoffrei inde thei were near to abandon their
search for the sight and sound were sicken even to men who were
accustom to those of battlefield when dick quick ear caught the
tone of an english voic call for help appar it came from the
back of the doge tribun where lai a heap of dead gaili dress folk
who had fallen in the flight and been crush not by the earthquak
but by the feet of their fellow these blacken and disfigur men
and women thei drag awai with much toil and at last to their joi
beneath them all found sir geoffrei carleon in anoth few minut he
must have di for he wa almost suffoc
inde he would certainli have perish with the other had he not been
thrown under a fix bench whenc on leg project which as thei
could see at onc wa crush and broken thei drew him out as gentli
as thei could and gave him water to drink whereof mercifulli for
them all sinc by now thei were utterli parch with thirst thei had
discov a larg silver pitcher full stand in the corner of a
littl antechamb to the tribun it wa half hidden with fragment
of fine dress and even jewel torn from the person of the lord and
ladi
i thank you friend he said faintli i prai them to keep seat
but thei went mad and would not listen those behind trod down those in
front till that doorwai wa choke and i wa hurl beneath the bench
oh it wa terribl to hear them dy about me and to know that soon i
must follow thi had it not been for you i should have done for my
leg is crush and there wa no air
then have drunk and drunk until even their rage thirst wa
satisfi thei found a plank lai sir geoffrei on it thei depart
from that human shambl whenc the piteou cri of those still
imprison there whom thei could not reach pursu them horribl
thu slowli enough for there were but three of them two hamper by
their mail thei bore sir geoffrei across the place of arm save for
the dead and dy and some ghoullik knave who plunder them by
thi time it wa almost desert
inde a larg band of these wretch who had emerg like wolv from
their lair in the lowest quarter of the great citi catch sight of
the gold chain sir geoffrei wore ran up with drawn dagger to kill and
rob them
see them come grei dick slip the black bow from it case and sent
an arrow sing through the heart of the oneei villain who captain
them thereon the rest left him where he fell and ran off to steal and
slai elsewher then without a word dick unstrung the bow and onc more
laid hold of an end of the plank
thei came to the mouth of that street where the bravo had waylaid them
on the previou night onli to find that thei could not pass thi wai
here most of the hous were thrown down and from their ruin rose
smoke and the hideou scream of those who perish it wa thi part
of venic the home of the poorer folk which suffer most from the
earthquak that had scarc touch mani of the finer quarter still
it wa reckon afterward that in all it took a toll of nearli ten
thousand live
turn from thi street thei made their wai to the bank of a great
canal that here ran into the harbour that on which thei had been row
to the place of arm here by good luck thei found a small boat float
keep uppermost for it had been overturn by the number of peopl who
crowd into it thi boat thei right with much toil and discov
within it a drown ladi also an oar caught beneath the seat after
thi their dread journei wa easi at least by comparison for
now all the gloom had roll awai the sun shone out and a fresh and
pleasant wind blew from the sea toward the land
so at last pass mani sad and strang scene that need not be
describ thei came safe to the step of the ambassador beauti
hous which wa quit uninjur here thei found sever of hi servant
wring their hand and weep for word had been brought to them that
he wa dead also in the hall thei were met by anoth woe for there on
a couch lai stretch the ladi carleon smitten with some dread sick
which caus blood to flow from her mouth and ear a physician wa

so thei carri them both to their own larg sleep chamber on the
upper floor there the surgeon set sir geoffrei broken bone skilfulli
enough though when he saw the state of the crush limb he shook
hi head and said it would be best to cut it off thi howev sir
geoffrei would not suffer to be done
it will kill me i am sure or if not then the pest which that ship
light of the east ha brought here from cypru will do it work on
me but i care noth for sinc you sai that my wife must die i would
die with her and be at rest
at sunset ladi carleon di er she pass awai she sent for hugh and
dick her bed by her command had been move to an open window for she
seem to crave air by it wa place that of sir geoffrei so that the
two of them could hold each other hand

she smile at him gratefulli then turn her face toward sir geoffrei
and press hi hand so present she pass awai the tear run
from her fade ey
when it wa over and the women had cover her hugh and dick left the
room for thei could bear no more
i have seen sad sight said hugh with someth like a sob but
never befor on so sad
ay answer dick that of the wound dy on creci field wa a mai
dai revel compar to thi though it is but on old woman who ha gone
oh how heavili thei part who have dwelt togeth these forti year
and twa my careless tongu thi morn that foretold it as a jest
in the hall thei met the physician who rush wildei through the
doorwai to ask how hi patient fare
ah he said to them in french when he knew well signor that
nobl ladi ha not gone alon i tell you that score of whom i know
ar alreadi dead in venic swept off by thi swift and horribl plagu
death and all hi angel stalk through the citi thei sai that he

by the quai and by god mercyif he ha ani left for usi can well
believ it the doge and hi council but now have issu a decre that
all who perish must be buri at onc see to it signor lest the
offic come and bear her awai to some common grave from which her
rank will not protect her
then he went to visit sir geoffrei return present he gave them
some direct as to hi treatment and rush out as he had rush in
thei never saw him again two dai later thei learn that he himself
wa dead of the pest
that night thei buri ladi carleon in her son grave which dick had
help to prepar for her sinc no sexton could be bribe to do the
work inde these were all busi enough attend to the inter of
the great on of venic in that churchyard alon thei saw six buri
in progress also after the priest had read hi hurri offic as
thei left the gate whenc ladi carleon bearer had alreadi fled
affright thei met more melancholi process herald by a torch or
two whereof the light fell upon some sheet and uncoffin form
twixt earthquak and plagu murgh the helper is help veri well
said grei dick grimli and hugh onli groan in answer
such wa the begin of the aw plagu which travel from the east
to venic and all europ and afterward becam known by the name of
the black death dai by dai the number of it victim increas
the hundr of yesterdai were the thousand of the morrow soon the
graveyard were full the plagu pit long and deep were full and the
dead were taken out to sea by shipload and there cast into the ocean
at length even thi could not be done sinc none were forthcom
who would dare the task for it becam known that those who did so
themselv would sure die
so where folk fell there thei lai in the hous were mani of them
thei cumber and poison the street and the veri church even the
anim sicken and perish until that great citi wa turn into an
open tomb the reek of it taint the air for mile around so that even
those who pass it in ship far out to sea turn faint and present
themselv sicken and di but er thei di thei bore on the fatal
gift to other land
moreov starvat fell upon the place though the hous were full of
rich these would scarc suffic to bui bread for those who remain
aliv the doge and some of hi council pass law to lighten the
miseri of the peopl but soon few heed these law which none were
left to enforc the vagabond and evilmind men who began by rob
the desert hous of jewel monei and plate end by search them
for food and cast asid their treasur as worthless dross it wa
even said that some of them did wors thing thing not to be name
sinc in it extrem natur know no shame onli if bread and meat
were scarc wine remain in plenti in the midst of death meny
and womenwho perhap had desert their wive their husband or their
children fear to take the evil from them made the night horribl
by their drunken blasphemi and revel as sailor sometim do
upon a sink ship know that thei must die thei wish to die
merri
sir geoffrei carleon live a long while after the death of hi wife
when he pass awai at last ten dai or so later it wa painlessli of
the mortif of hi broken limb not of the pest which went by him
as though it knew that he wa alreadi doom

ladi carleon had been a good and provid housewif
so those three did not starv although sir geoffrei would touch littl
of the salt stuff he exist on a few fruit when thei could get
them and after these were gone on wine mingl with water
at length came the end for two dai he had lain senseless on night
howev david who wa watch in hi chamber crept into the room
where hugh slept hard by and told them that sir geoffrei wa awak and
call them thei rose and went to him by the light of the moon which
shone in at the open window that same window through which ladi carleon
had look toward england er she pass awai thei saw him ly
quietli a happi smile upon hi face

later on if you can it is of valu sinc all my life i have collect

thei obei weep ye even grei dick wept a littl present when
thei look up thei saw that sir geoffrei wa dead dead without pain or
sorrow of the first he had suffer none for dai and the second wa
far from him who wish to die
leav the ancient woman in charg of the hous which she bar and
bolt next morn thei took a boat and the three of them row the
bodi of the old knight a leagu out into the quiet sea there after a
brief prayer thei cast him into the deep weight with stone so that
he might never rise again
then thei return not too soon for thei found thiev in the act of
break into the hous probabl in search of food these miser
halfstarv men thei spare though thei could have kill them easili
enough thei even gave them a pouch full of biscuit and dri meat er
thei dismiss them thi thei did quickli sinc on of them as thei
could see wa alreadi stricken by the plagu and had not long to live
when thei were gone the old woman be out of the hous whenc she
had fled on hear the robber thei collect all sir geoffrei and
hi ladi jewel and plate of which there wa much for he live in
state in venic as becam an ambassador these thei buri in three
larg iron box beneath the flagston of the cellar the safest place
that thei could find have thrown the excav earth into the canal
under cover of the dark thei replac these stone and strew dust
over them
wonder whether it would ever be their lot to look upon these chest
and their content again thei left the cellar to find the old woman
knock at the back door of the hous whither she had return
frighten by the sight and sound in the citi thei bade her bring
them food which thei need much who had labour so hard on that

that a good thought said hugh dick fetch the tool for if we
try to move thi fellow he will go farther than we can follow him
dick went and return present with an inkhorn a roll of parchment
pen and a littl tabl then hugh sat himself down on the altar rail
place the tabl in front of him and said
sai on ill write sinc you cannot
now nichola have befor hi glaze ey the vision of immin
judgment briefli but clearli told all the truth at last he told how he
had drug red ev give the name of the bane which he mix in the
milk she drank he told how when her mind wa sleep though her bodi
wa awak none know the wicked that had been wrought save he and
acour and least of all her father thei had led her to the altar like
a lamb to the slaughter and there marri her to the man she hate he
told how although he had fled from england to save hi life acour had
never ceas to desir her and to plot to get her into hi power ani
more than he had ceas to fear hugh vengeanc for thi reason he
said he had clad himself in the armour of anoth knight at creci and
in that guis accept merci at hugh hand leav de la roch to
die in hi place beneath that same hand for thi reason also he had
command him nichola to bring about the death of hugh de cressi and
hi squir beneath the dagger of assassin in the street of venic
a fate from which thei had been save onli by the wizard in the yellow
cap whom no steel could harm
the blackheart villain hiss dick well for your comfort holi
priest ill tell you who that wizard is he is death himself death the
sword death the fire death the helper and present youll meet him

i knew it i knew it groan the wretch man oh such is the end
of sin whereof we think so littl in our dai of strength
nai broke in hugh youll meet not the minist but him whom he
serv and in hi hand ar merci be silent dick for thi wretch
make confess and hi time is short spare the tool and save your
wrath for him who wield it go now and fetch david dai that he mai
wit also
so dick went and nichola continu hi tale throw light into mani
a dark place though there wa littl more that hugh thought worthi of
record
present david came and start back in horror at the sight of that
yellow tortur face set upon a live skeleton then the write wa
read and nichola held up by dick set hi signatur with a trembl
hand to thi hi confess of the truth thi done thei sign as
wit all three of them
now hugh whose piti wa stir wish to move nichola and lai him on
a bed in some chamber and if thei could find someon to watch him till
the end but the priest refus thi chariti
let me die befor the altar he said where i mai set my ey upon
him whom i have betrai afresh and he point to the carv ivori
crucifix which hung abov it oh be warn be warn my brethren
he went on in a wail voic you ar all of you still young you mai
be led astrai as i wa by the desir for power by the hope of wealth
you mai sell yourselv to the wick as i did i who onc wa good
and strove toward the right if satan tempt you thu then rememb
nichola the priest and hi dread death and see how he pai hi
servant the plagu ha taken other yet thei have di at peac but
i i die in hell befor i see it fire
not so said hugh you have repent and i against whom you have
sin perhap more than all forgiv you as i am sure my ladi would
could she know
then it is more than i do mutter grei dick to himself why should
i forgiv him becaus he rot aliv as mani a better man ha done and
goe to reap what he ha sown who if he had won hi wai would have sent
us befor him at the dagger point yet who know each of us sin in
hi own fashion and perchanc sin is born of the blood and not of the
will if ever i meet murgh again ill ask him but perhap he will not
answer
thu reflect dick half to david who fear and did not understand
him and half to himself er ever he had finish with hi thought
which were not such as sir andrew would have approv father nichola
began to die
it wa not a pleasant sight thi death of hi though of it physic
part noth shall be written let that be buri with other record of
the great plagu onli in thi case hi mind triumph for a while over
the dissolut of hi bodi when there wa littl left of him save bone
and sinew still he found strength to cry out to god for merci ye and
to rais himself and cast what had been arm about the ivori rood and
kiss it feet with what had been lip and in hi last death struggl to
drag it down and pant out hi ultim breath beneath it weight
so there thei left him a horribl huddl heap upon which gleam the
ivori crucifix and went their wai gasp into the air
chapter xvi
at avignon
hard upon two month had gone by when at length these three hugh
grei dick and david dai set ey upon the tower of state avignon
stand red against the sunset and encircl by the blue water of the
rhone terribl beyond imagin had been the journei of these men
who follow in the footstep of murgh thei saw him not it is true
but alwai thei saw hi handiwork death death everywher death
noth but death
on night thei sup at an inn with the host hi famili and servant
twelv folk in all in seem health when thei rose in the morn
on old woman and a littl child alon remain the rest were dead
or dy on dai thei were surpris and taken by robber desper
outcast of the mountain who gave them twentyfour hour to make
their peac with heavener thei hang them becaus thei had slain so
mani of the band befor thei were overpow
but when those twentyfour hour of grace had elaps it would have
been easi for them to hang all who remain of those robber themselv
so thei took the best of their hors and their illgotten gold and rode
on again leav the murder murder by a stronger power than man
thei went through desol villag where the crop rot in the
field thei went through stricken town whereof the moan and the stench
rose in a foul incens to heaven thei cross river where the veri
fish had di by thousand poison of the dead that roll seaward
in their water the pleasant land had becom a hell and untouch
unharm thei plod onward through those deep of hell but a night
or two befor thei had slept in a citi whereof the popul or those
who remain aliv of them seem to have gone mad in on place thei
danc and sang and made love in an open squar in anoth band
of nake creatur march the street sing hymn and flog
themselv till the blood ran down to their heel while the passersbi
prostrat themselv befor them these were the forerunn of the
mad dancer of the follow year
in a field outsid of thi citi thei came upon even a more dread
sight here forti or fifti frenzi peopl most of them drunk were
engag in burn a poor jew hi wife and two children upon a great
fire made of the stave of winecask which thei had plunder from
some neighbour cellar when hugh and hi companion came upon the
scene the jew had alreadi burn and thi crowd of devil were prepar
to cast hi wife and children into the flame which thei had been
forc to see devour their husband and father inde with yell of
brutal laughter thei were thrust the children into two great cask
er thei roll them into the heart of the fire while the wretch
mother stood by and shriek
what do you sir ask hugh ride up to them
we burn wizard and their spawn sir knight answer the ringlead
know that these accurs jew have poison the well of our townw
have wit who saw them do itand thu brought the plagu upon
us moreov she and he point to the womanwa seen talk not
fourteen dai ago to the devil in a yellow cap who appear everywher
befor the death begin now roll them in roll them in
hugh drew hi sword for thi sight wa more than hi english flesh and
blood could bear dick also unsheath the black bow while young david
produc a great knife which he carri
free those children said hugh to the man with whom he had spoken a
fat fellow with roll bloodshot ey
get you to hell stranger he answer or well throw you on the
fire also as a jew in knight dress
free those children said hugh again in a terribl voic or i send
you befor them be warn i speak truth
be you warn stranger for i speak truth also repli the man
mimick him now friend he ad tuck up the devil brat in
their warm bed
thei were hi last word for hugh thrust with hi sword and down he
went
now a furiou clamour aros the mob snatch up burn stave
bludgeon knive or whatev thei had at hand and prepar to kill the
three without wait for order dick began to shoot david a bold
young man rush at on of the most violent and stab him and hugh
who had leapt from hi hors set himself back to back with the other
two thrice dick shot and at the third deadli arrow these drunken
fellow grew sober enough to understand that thei wish no more of
them
suddenli act on a common impuls thei fled awai everi on onli
leav behind them those who had fallen beneath the arrow and the
sword but some who were so full of wine that thei could not run
tumbl headlong and lai there helpless
woman said hugh when thei had depart your husband is lost but
you and your children ar save now go your wai and thank whatev god
you worship for hi small merci
ala sir knight the poor creatur a still young and not unhandsom
jewess wail in answer whither shall i go if i return to that town
those christian men will sure murder me and my children as thei have
alreadi murder my husband kill us now by the sword or the bowit
will be a kindnessbut leav us not here to be tortur by the
christian men accord to their fashion with us poor jew
ar you will to go to avignon ask hugh after think awhil
ay sir knight or anywher awai from these christian inde at
avignon i have a brother who perchanc will protect us
then mount my hors said hugh dick and david draw those two
youngster from the tub and set them on your beast we can walk
so the children two come littl girl of eight and six year of ag
or thereabout were drag out of their dread prison and lift to
the saddl the wretch widow run to the bonfir snatch from it
her husband burntoff hand and hid it in the bosom of her filthi robe
then she took some of the white ash and threw them toward that citi
mutter curs as she did so
what do you ask hugh curious
i prai sir to jehovah the god of the jew that for everi grain
of these ash he mai take a life in payment for that of my murder
husband and i think that he will listen
like enough answer hugh cross himself but woman can you
wonder that we christian hold you sorcer when we hear such prayer
from your lip
she turn with a tragic motion and point to the bone of her
husband smoulder in the fire answer
and can you wonder sir that we wretch creatur utter such prayer
when you our master do such deed as thi
no answer hugh i cannot let us be go from thi shambl
so thei went a melancholi process if ever there on wa seen upon
thi earth as the three englishmen march behind the hors with their
weep burden grei dick reflect aloud after hi fashion
jew and christian he said the jew kill on man who chanc to
be a god though thei knew it not and ever sinc the christian have
kill thousand of the jew now which is the most wick those jew
who kill the man who wa a god becaus he said he wa a god or those
christian who throw a man into a fire to burn befor hi wife and
children ey a man who never said that he wa a god but who thei
said put poison into their well which he did not do but which thei
believ he did becaus he wa on of the race that thirteen hundr
year ago kill their god ah well jew and christian i think the
same devil dwell in them all but murgh alon know the truth of the
matter if ever we meet again ill ask him of it meanwhil we go to
avignon in strang compani whereof all the holi priest yonder if ani
of them still live to sai noth of the peopl mai demand an account
of us
so spoke dick as on who seek an answer but neither of hi companion
gave him ani
on thei went through the ruin land unpursu although thei had just
brought sundri men to their death for now neither law nor justic
wa left and those kill who could and those di who must unwept and
unaveng onli certain travel fly thei knew not whither fly
from doom to doom ei them with hate and loath becaus of their
companion those who consort with jew must thei thought be the
enemi of everi christian soul
well wa it for them perhap that the earli winter night wa close
in when thei reach the wonder bridg of st bnzet now quit
unguard sinc a wors foe reign in avignon than ani that it could
fear from without thei cross it unnot for here none linger in
the gloom and rain save on poor woman who call out to them that all
she love were dead and that she went to seek them then befor thei
could interfer she scrambl to the parapet of the bridg and with a
wild cry leapt into the foam water that rush beneath
god forgiv and rest her mutter hugh cross himself the other
onli shrug their shoulder such dread sight fed their ey daili
till thei learn to take littl note of them
in a desert place on the farther side of the bridg thei halt and
hugh said to the jewish widow
woman here is avignon where you tell us there ar those who will
befriend you so now let us part we have done what we can for you and
it is not safe either for you or for us that we should be seen togeth
in thi christian citi
sir you speak well she answer be pleas er we separ to
meet no more perchanc to tell me your name that i mai rememb them
and hand them down among my peopl from gener to gener
so he told her and thrust onto her a gift of monei and the most of such
food as remain to them then the poor woman lift up her arm and
said
i rebecca daughter of onia and wife of nathan call down on you
hugh de cressi richard archer and david dai and on your children
forev the bless of jehovah becaus you have rescu the widow
and her children from the fire and aveng the murder of the husband
and the father o god of my peopl as thou didst save lot and hi hous
from the flame of sodom so save these trueheart and merci men
turn from them the sword of thy wrath when it smite the sin citi
cast the cloak of thy protect about them and all thei love prosper
their handiwork in peac and in war fulfil their desir upon their
enemi and at last let them die full of year and honour and so be
gather into thy etern bosom thu prayeth rebecca the daughter of
onia and thu shall it be
then lead her children she turn and vanish into the dark
now said dick when she had gone although thei were spoken by a jew
whom men call accurs becaus their forefath fulfil propheci
or some few of them wrought a great crime when the world wa young and
therebi brought about the salvat of mankind as we believ those
ar among the most comfort word to which my ear have listen
especi such of them as dealt with the fulfil of our desir upon
our enemi in war well thei ar spoke and i doubt not regist in
a book which will not be lost so master let us seek a lodg in thi
citi of avignon which for my part i do with a light heart
hugh nod and hi heart also wa lighten by those word of bless
and good omen mount their hors thei took a street that led them
past the great roch de dom on the crest of which stood the mighti
palac of the pope as yet unfinish but still on of the vastest
build thei had ever seen here on the battlement and in front of
the gatewai burn great fire lit by order of hi holi to purifi
the air and protect him and hi court from the plagu
leav thi place on their right thei rode slowli along on of the
princip street of the town seek an inn soon thei found on a
larg place that had a sign on which three shepherd were paint
and turn to enter it gatewai but when thei saw them out of that
gatewai rush a mob of frantic peopl wave sword and cudgel and
sai that thei would have no stranger there to bring the death among
them
let us go on said hugh for here it seem we ar not welcom
so thei went and tri three other inn in turn at two of them thei
met with a like greet but the door of the third were close and
the place wa desert then for a crowd began to gather round them
wearili enough thei turn up anoth street at hazard thu thei wend
their wai back toward the great central rock think that there thei
might find some more hospit tavern
follow thi new street thei reach a less crowd suburb of the
town where larg dwell stood in their own garden on of these
thei saw by the flare of some of those fire which burn all about the
citi in thi time of pestil seem to be a small castl at least
it had a moat round it and a drawbridg which wa down see that
lamp burn in it window hugh who wa worn out with their long
journei took a sudden resolut
doubtless some knight dwell in thi fine hous he said to hi
companion let us go up and declar our name and degre and by virtu
of them claim the hospit which is our right
be it so grumbl dick we cannot be wors treat there than
we were at the inn unless the owner add arrow to the sword and
cudgel
thei rode across the drawbridg to the gatewai of the littl castl
which wa open and find no on there through a small courtyard to
the door which also wa open
david dismount and knock on it but none answer
an empti hous belong to no on said dick at ani rate in these
time let us enter
thei did so and saw that the place wa sumptuous appoint though
ancient it wa not larg have as thei afterward discov been a
fortif on an outer wall now demolish which had been turn
to the purpos of a dwell leav the hall out of which open the
refectori thei mount a stone stair to the upper chamber and enter
on of them
here thei saw a strang and piteou sight on a bed about which candl
still burn lai a young woman who had been veri beauti arrai in
a bride robe
dead of the plagu said hugh and desert at her death well she
had better luck than mani sinc she wa not left to die alon her
dress and these candl show it
ay answer dick but fear took the watcher at last and thei
ar fled well we will fill their place and if thei do not return
tomorrow give her honour burial in her own courtyard here be
fine lodg for us master so let us bide in them until the right
owner cast us out come david and help me rais that drawbridg
fine lodg these prove to be inde sinc as thei found no hous
in avignon wa better furnish with all thing need but and thi
will show how dread were the time dure these dai that thei made
thi their home thei never so much as learn the name of that poor ladi
arrai in the bride dress and laid out upon her marriag bed
in the butteri and cellar were plenti provis of food have
eaten of it with thank thei chose out on of the bedchamb
and slept there quit undisturb till the morn sun shone in at the
windowplac and awok them then thei aros and dig a shallow
grave in the courtyard with some garden tool which thei found in a
shed thei bore out the poor bride and remov onli her jewel which
were rich enough buri her there in her wed dress thi sad
duti finish thei wash themselv with water from the well and
breakfast after thei had eaten thei consult as to what thei should
do next
we came here to lai a certain caus befor hi holi said hugh
let us go up to the palac declar our busi and estat and ask
audienc
so leav david in charg of the hous which thei name the bride
tower becaus of the dead ladi and the littl keep which rose abov it
and of the hors that thei had stall in the stabl thei went out
and made their wai to the great entranc of the pope palac here thei
found the gate shut and bar with a huge fire burn behind them
still thei knock until some guard appear arm with crossbow and
ask their busi thei said thei desir to see hi holi or at
least on of hi secretari whereon the guard ask whenc thei came
thei repli from itali and were told that if so thei would find no
entranc there sinc the death had come from itali now hugh gave hi
name and state hi busi on hear which the guard laugh at him
annul of a fals marriag said their captain go lai your
petit befor death who will do your busi swiftli if he ha not
done it alreadi get you gone you english knight with your whitefac
squir we want no english here at the best of time and least of all
if thei hail from itali
come on master said dick there ar more wai into a hous than
by the front doorand we wont want to leav our brain to greas it
hing
so thei went awai wonder whither thei should betak themselv or
what thei could do next as it chanc thei had not long to wait for
an answer present a lanternjaw notari in a frai russet gown who
must have been watch their movement approach them and ask
them what had been their busi at the pope palac hugh told him
whereon the lawyer find that he wa a person of high degre becam
deferenti in hi manner moreov he announc that he wa a notari
name basil of tour and on of the legal secretari of hi holi
who just now wa live without the gate of the palac by express
command in order to attend to the affair of suitor at the papal
court dure the great sick he ad howev that he wa abl
to commun with those within and that doubtless it might be in hi
power to forward the caus of the nobl knight sir hugh de cressi in
which alreadi he took much interest
there would be a fee suggest dick look at the man coldli
basil answer with a smirk that fee and legal affair were
insepar the latter natur involv the former not that he care
for monei he remark especi in thi time of gener woe still
it would never do for a lawyer howev humbl to creat a preced
which might be us against hi craft in better dai then he name a
sum
hugh hand him doubl what he ask whereon he began to manifest great
zeal in hi case inde he accompani them to the fortifi hous
that thei had name the bride tower which he alleg with or without
truth he had never seen befor there he wrote down all particular of
the suit
sir edmund acour count de noyon seigneur of cattrina he said
present why i think that a lord of those name had audienc with hi
holi some while ago just befor the pest grew bad in avignon and
the gate of the palac were order to be shut i know not what pass
on the occas not have been retain in the caus but i will find
out and tell you tomorrow
find out also if it pleas you learn basil said hugh whether
or no thi knight with the three name is still in avignon if so i
have a word or two to sai to him
i will i will answer the lanternjaw notari yet i think it
most unlik that ani on who can bui or beg a hors to ride awai on
should stai in thi old citi just now unless inde the law of hi
order bind him to do so that he mai minist to the afflict well
if the pest spare me and you tomorrow morn i will be back here at
thi hour to tell you all that i can gather
how did thi sick begin in avignon ask grei dick
nobl squir none know for certain in the autumn we had great rain
heavi mist and other thing contrari to the usual cours of natur
such as strang light shine in the heaven and so forth then after
a dai of much heat on even a man clad in a red and yellow cap who
wore a cloak of thick black fur and necklac of black pearl wa
seen stand in the marketplac inde i saw him myself there wa
someth so strang and dread about the appear of thi
man although it is true that some sai he wa no more than a common
mountebank arrai thu to win penc that the peopl set upon him
thei hurl stone at him thei attack him with sword and everi other
weapon and thought that thei had kill him when suddenli he appear
outsid the throng unhurt then he stretch out hi whiteglov hand
toward them and melt into the gloom
onli ad basil nervous it wa note afterward that all those
who had tri to injur the man were among the first to die of the pest
thank god i wa not on of them inde i did my best to hold them
back which perhap is the reason why i am aliv todai
a strang stori said hugh though i have heard someth like it in
other citi through which we have pass well till tomorrow at thi
hour friend basil
we have learn two thing master said dick when the lawyer had
bow himself out first that acour is or ha been in avignon and
secondli that murgh the messeng murgh the sword ha been or is in
avignon let us go seek for on of the other of them sinc for my part
i desir to meet them both
so all that dai thei sought but found neither
next morn basil reappear accord to hi promis and inform
them that their busi wa on foot also he said that it wa like to

difficult to set asid
hugh answer that if onli he could be grant an audienc with hi
holi he had evid which would make the justic of hi caus
plain what he sought wa an audienc
the notari scratch hi lantern jaw and ask how that could be
brought about when everi gate of the palac wa shut becaus of the
plagu still perhap it might be manag he ad if a certain sum
were forthcom to bribe variou janitor and person in author
hugh gave him the sum out of the store of gold thei had taken from the
robber in the mountain with someth over for himself so basil
depart sai that he would return at the same hour on the morrow
if the plagu spare him and them hi patron as he prai the saint
that it might do
hugh watch him go then turn to dick and said
i mistrust me of that hungri wolf in sheep cloth who talk so
larg and yet doe noth let us go out and search avignon again
perchanc we mai meet acour or at least gather some tide of him
so thei went leav the tower lock and bar who perchanc would
have been wiser to follow basil a debas and fraudul lawyer of
no charact at all thi man live upon such fee as he could wring
without author from those who came to lai their suit befor the
papal court plai upon their hope and fear and pretend to a
power which he did not possess had thei done so thei might have seen
him turn up a certain side street and when he wa sure that none
watch him slip into the portal of an ancient hous where visitor of
rank were accustom to lodg
mount some stair without meet ani on for thi hous like mani
other seem to be desert in that time of pestil he knock

by their repres must appear befor him he will give no ex

dick glanc back over hi shoulder saw the madei priest their
leader go down like an ox beneath the blow of a lead bludgeon

drawbridg that span the moat and seiz the crank wound
furious slowli ah how slowli it rose for it wa heavi and thei
were but two tire men also the chain and cog were rusti with disus
yet it did rise and as it came home at last the fierc mob thirst
for their blood and guess where thei would refug appear in front
of it and by the light of some torch which thei bore caught sight of
them
come in friend mock grei dick as thei ran up and down the edg of
the moat howl with rage and disappoint come in if you would
sup on arrowhead such as thi and he sent on of hi deadli shaft
through the breast of a redhead fellow who wave a torch in on hand

cri

you to kill you well starv you till you die stai there and rot or
step forth and be torn to piec as it pleas you english wizard
then thei all slunk back and vanish or seem to vanish down the

when an onslaught wa deliv on the main gatewai at night thei
had beaten their assail by let fall upon them through the
machicouli or overhang apertur great stone that had been pile
up there perhap gener befor when the place wa built
still the attack did not slacken inde the hate of the citizen of
avignon against these two bold englishmen whose courag and resourc
thei attribut to help given to them by the power of evil seem to
grow from dai to dai even as the plagu grew in the street of that
soreafflict citi from their wall thei could see friar preach
a kind of crusad against them thei point toward the tower with
crucifix invok their hearer to pull it stone from stone and slai
the wizard within the wizard who had conspir with the accurs
jew even beneath the ey of hi holi the pope to bring doom on
avignon
the eighth morn broke at length and it first red rai discov hugh
and dick kneel side by side behind the battlement of the gatewai
each of them wa make petit to heaven in hi own fashion for
forgiv of hi sin sinc thei were outworn and believ that thi
dai would be their last
what did you prai for dick ask hugh glanc at hi companion
fierc face which in that half light look deathlik and unearthli
what did i prai for well for the first part let it be that betwixt
me and whatev power sent me out to do it busi on the earth but
for the lastil tell you it wa that we mai go henc with such a
guard of dead french as never yet escort two englishmen from avignon
to heavenor hell ay and we will master for todai as thei shout
to us theyll storm thi tower but if our strength hold out there
mani a on wholl never win it crest
rather would i have di peacefulli dick yet the blood of these
hound will not weigh upon my soul see that thei seek to murder us
for no fault except that we save a woman and two children from their
cruel devilri oh could i but know that red ev and sir andrew were
safe awai id die a happi man
i think we shall know that and much more befor tomorrow dawn
master or never know anyth again look thei gather yonder now let
us eat for perhap later we shall find no time
the afternoon drew on toward even and still these two live of all
the hundr of missil which were shot or hurl at them although a
few struck not on of them had pierc their armour so as to do them
hurt the wall and battlement or some good fate had protect them
thrice had the french come on and thrice thei had retreat befor
those arrow that could not miss and as yet bridg and door were safe
look said dick as he set down a cup of wine that he had drain
for hi thirst wa rage thei send an embassi and he point to
a priest the same madei fellow who preach in the squar when the
notari basil led them into a trap and to a man with him who bore a
white cloth upon a lanc shall i shoot them
nai answer hugh why kill craze folk who think that thei serv
god in their own fashion we will hear what thei have to sai
present the pair stood within speak distanc and the priest call
out
hearken you wizard so far your master the devil ha protect you
but now your hour ha come we have author from those who rule thi
citi and from the church to summon you to surrend and if you will
not then to slai you both
that you shameless friar answer hugh you have been strive to
do these mani dai yet it is not we who have been slain although we
stand but two men against a multitud but if we surrend what then
then you shall be put upon your trial wizard and if found guilti

put upon our trial befor our execution why i think those fire
ar alight alreadi nai nai mad priest go back and tell those whom
you have fool that if thei want us thei can come and take us which
theyll not do live
then the furiou friar began to curs them hurl at them the
anathema of the church till at length dick call to him to begon or
he would send an arrow to help him on the road
so thei went and present the sun sank
now let us bewar said dick the moon is near her full and will rise
soon theyll attack between time when we cannot see to shoot
ay answer hugh moreov now thi gatewai is no place for us of
arrow there ar few left nor could we see to us them in the dark
the stone too ar all spent and therefor thei can bridg the moat and
batter down the door unharm
what then ask dick as we cannot fly where shall we die
on the roof of the old tower i think whenc we can hurl ourselv
at last and so perhap escap be taken aliv and torment look you
dick that tower is mount by three straight flight of step the
first two of these well hold with such arrow as remain to usther
ar three and twenti as i thinkand the last with ax and sword
listen thei come take a brand from the hall hearth and let us go light
the flambeaux
so thei went and set fire to the great torch of wood and tallow that
were set in their iron holder to light the step of the tower er the
last of them wa burn thei heard their enemi raven without
listen said hugh as thei descend to the head of the first flight of
stair thei ar across the moat
as he spoke the massiv door crash in beneath the blow of a baulk of
timber
now said hugh as thei strung their bow six arrow apiec here if
we can get off so mani and the odd eleven at our next stand ah thei
come
the mob rush into the hall below wave torch and sword and
hunt it as dog hunt a covert
the english wizard have hid themselv awai cri a voic let us
burn the place for so we ar sure to catch them
nai nai answer anoth voic that of the mad friar we must have
them beneath the tortur that we mai learn how to lift the curs
from avignon and the name of their accomplic on earth and in hell
search search search
littl need to search said grei dick step out on to the land
devil go join your fellowdevil in that hell you talk of and he
sent an arrow through hi heart
for a moment there follow the silenc of constern while the mob
stood stare at their fallen leader then with a yell of rage thei
charg the stair and that frai began which wa told of in avignon
for gener hugh and dick shot their arrow nor could thei miss
see what wa their target inde some of those from the great black
bow pin foe to foe beneath them but so crowd were the assail
on the narrow stair that thei could not shoot back thei advanc
helpless thrust to their doom by the weight of those who press
behind
now thei were near the dead still on their feet be born forward
by the live to whom thei serv as shield hugh and dick ran to the
head of the second flight and thenc shot off the arrow that remain
dick loos the last of them and of thi fear shaft it wa said that
it slew three men pierc through the bodi of on the throat of the
second and buri it barb in the skull of the third on the lowest
step now dick unstrung hi bow and thrust it into it case on hi
shoulder for he wa mind that thei should go togeth at the last
shaft have sung their song he said with a fierc laugh now it is
the turn of the ax and sword to make anoth music
then he grip sir hugh by the hand sai
farewel master oh i hold thi a merri death such as the saint
grant to few ay and so would you were you as free as i am well
doubtless your ladi ha gone befor or at worst soon she will follow
after and greet you in the gate of death where murgh sit and keep hi
count of pass soul
farewel friend answer hugh be she quick or dead thu red ev
would wish that i should die a cressi a cressi he cri and drove
hi sword through the throat of a soldier who rush at him
thei fought a veri good fight as doubtless the dead were tell each
other while thei pass from that red stair to such rest as thei had
won thei had fought a veri good fight and it wa hard to sai which had
done the best hugh white sword or dick grei ax and now unwound
still save for a bruis or two thei stood there in the moonlight upon
the stark edg of the tall tower the foe in front and black space
beneath there thei stood lean on ax and sword and draw their
breath in great sob those two great harvestmen who that dai had toil
so hard in the rich field of death
for a while the evergath crowd of their assail remain still
stare at them then the leader began to whisper to each other for
thei scarc seem to dare to talk aloud
what shall we do ask on these ar not men no men could have
fought as thei have fought us for seven dai and at last have slain us
like sparrow in a net and themselv remain unhurt
no answer anoth and no mortal archer could send hi shaft
through the bodi of three still it is finish now unless thei find
wing and fly awai so let us take them
ye ye broke in grei dick with hi hiss laugh come and take
us you cur of avignon have our breath again we ar readi to be
taken and he lift hi ax and shook it
seiz them shout the leader of the french seiz them echo
those who pour up the stair behind
but there the matter end sinc none could find stomach to face that
ax and sword so at length thei took anoth counsel
bring bow and shoot them through the leg thu we shall bring them
live to their trial command the captain of the men of avignon he
wa their fourth captain on that on dai for the other three lai upon
the stair or in the hall
now hugh and dick spoke togeth few word and swift as to whether
thei should charg or leap from the wall and have done with it while
thei spoke a littl cloud float over the face of the moon so that
until it had gone the french could not see to shoot
it too riski said hugh if thei captur us we must die a death to
which i have no mind let us hurl our weapon at them then leap
so be it whisper dick do you aim at the captain on the left and i
will take the other readi now i think on creep near to us
i think so too hugh whisper back i felt the touch of hi
garment onli he seem to pass us from behind which cannot be
the cloud pass and onc again thei were bath in silver light it
show the men of avignon alreadi bend their bow it show hugh and
grei dick lift ax and sword to hurl them but between them and their
mark it show also a figur that thei knew well a stern and terribl
figur wear a strang cap of red and yellow and a cape of rich
black fur
o god of heaven ti murgh the helper gasp hugh
ay murgh the fire murgh the sword said dick ad quietli it
is true i wa wonder whether he would prove as good as hi word look
now look thei see him also
see him thei did inde and for a moment there wa silenc on that
crowd tower top where stood at least a score of men while their
fellow pack the hall and stair below by hundr all stare at
murgh and murgh stare back at them with hi cold ey then a voic
scream

you fly men of avignon fly
small need wa there for thi command alreadi cast down their bow
those on the tower top were rush to the mouth of the stair and
sinc it wa block with men us their sword upon them to hew a
road now those below think that it wa the english wizard who slew
them struck back
present all that stair and the crowd hall below black as the mouth
of the pit for such light as still burn soon were swept awai rang
with the scream and curs and stifl groan of the trodden down or
dy in the pitchi dark brother smote brother friend trampl
out the life of friend till the steep step were pile high and the

whiteglov hand upon hi breast and smile

dread tumult sank to silenc then murgh turn and spoke in hi slow
and ici voic

beneath thi cloak he wore the best of mail and on that mail the
slender dagger broke it point fall harmless to the ground next

chapter xix
the doom
it wa the last night of februari the bitterest night perhap of all
that sad winter when at length hugh de cressi grei dick and david
dai rode into the town of dunwich onli that morn thei had land at
yarmouth after a long long journei whereof the peril and the horror
mai be guess but need not be written franc through which thei had
pass seem to be but on vast grave over which the wail of those who
still surviv went up without ceas to the cold unpiti heaven
here in england the tale wa still the same thu in the great seaport
of yarmouth scarc enough peopl were left aliv to inter the
unshriven dead nor of these would ani stai to speak with them fear
lest thei had brought a fresh curs from oversea even the hors that
thei rode thei took from a stabl where thei whinni hungrili none
be there to feed them leav in their place a write of the debt
betwixt yarmouth and dunwich thei had travel through smitten town
and villag where a few wander fearfulli distraught with sorrow or
seek food in the street the veri dog lai dead and in the field
thei saw the carcass of cattl drag from the smokeless and desert
stead and half hidden in a windingsheet of snow for the black
plagu spare neither man nor beast
at the littl port of lowestoft thei met a sullen sailorman who stood
stare at the beach whereon hi fish boat lai overturn and awash
for lack of hand to drag it out of reach of the angri sea thei ask
him if he knew of how it fare with dunwich
by wai of answer he curs them ad
must i be forev pester as to dunwich thi is the third time of
late that i have heard of dunwich from wander folk begon thither
and gather tide for yourselv which i hope will pleas you as well
as thei do me
now if i were not in hast i would stai a while to teach you manner
you foulmouth churl mutter grei dick between hi teeth
let the fellow be said hugh wearili the men of lowestoft have ever
hate those of dunwich and it seem that a common woe doe not soften
heart soon enough we shall learn the truth
ay youll learn it soon enough shout the brute after them
dunwich boat wont steel lowestoft her for mani a year
so thei rode on through kessland which thei reach as night wa
close in through benacr and wrentham also past hous in which none
seem to dwell
murgh ha been here befor us i think said dick at length
then i hope that we mai overtak him answer hugh with a smile for
i need hi tidingsor hi rest oh dick dick he ad i wonder
ha ever man born a heavier burden for all thi weari while if i were
sure it would not be so bad for when earthli hope is done we mai turn
to other comfort but im not sure basil mai have li the priest
by the pit could onli swear to the red cloak of which there ar mani
though few be buri in them and dick there ar wors thing than
that perchanc acour got her after all
and perchanc he didnt answer dick well fret on if you will
the thing doe not troubl me who for my part am sure enough
of what man of what
of see the ladi ev er long
in thi world or the next dick
in thi i dont reckon of the next mayhap there we shall be blind and
not see besid of what us is that world to you where it is written
that thei neither marri nor ar given in marriag but ar as the
angel youll make no good angel im think while as for the ladi
ev she too human for it as yet
why do you think we shall see her on earth ask hugh ignor these
reflect
becaus he who is call the helper said as much and whatev he mai
be he is no liar do you not rememb what red ev told you when she
awok from that dream of her which wa no dream and do you not
rememb what sir andrew told you as to a certain meet in the
snowpest upon it and he wipe some of the drive flake from hi
facesir andrew who is a saint and therefor like murgh can be no
liar
if you think thu said hugh in a new voic why did you not sai so
befor
becaus i love not argument master and if i had you would ever have
reason with me from avignon to yarmouth town and spoilt my sleep of
night oh where is your faith
what is faith dick
the gift of belief master a veri great gift see what a man
believ is and will be true for him howev fals it mai prove for
other he who believ noth sow noth and therefor reap

who taught you these thing dick
on whom i am not like to forget or you either on who is my
master at archeri and whose word like hi arrow though thei be few
yet strike the heart of hidden truth oh fear not doubtless sorrow
wait you yonder and he point toward dunwich yet it come to
my lip that there joi beyond the sorrow the joi of battl and of
lovefor those who care for love which i think foolish there
stand a farm and the farmer is a friend of mine or us to be let us
go thither and feed these poor beast and ourselv or i think we will
never come to dunwich through thi cold and snow moreov he ad
thoughtfulli joi or sorrow or both of them ar best met by full men
and i wish to look to your har and my own for sword and ax ar
rust with the sea who know but that we mai need them in dunwich or
beyond when we meet with murgh as he promis that we should
so thei rode up to the hous and found dick friend the farmer ly
dead there in hi own yard whither hi famili had drag him er thei
determin to fly the place still there wa fodder in the stabl and
thei lit a fire in the kitchen hearth and drank of the wine which thei
had brought with them from the ship and at of the bacon which still
hung from the rafter thi done thei lai down to sleep a while about
on in the morn howev hugh rous dick and david sai that he
could rest no more and that someth in hi heart bade him push on to
dunwich
then let us follow your heart master said dick yawn yet i wish

them at such an hour but it stood open nor did ani challeng them from
the guardhous
thei keep an ill watch in dunwich nowadai grumbl dick well
perchanc there is on here to whom thei can trust that busi
hugh made no answer onli press on down the narrow street that wa
deep and dumb with snow till at length thei drew reign befor the door
of hi father hous in the marketplac the great hous where he
wa born he look at the window and note that although thei were
unshutt no friendli light shone in them he call aloud but echo

roar of the sea
doubtless all men ar asleep he said why should it be otherwis at
