merg at last into purpl moor and far awai the sombr etern
hill probabl the scene ha not chang veri much sinc the dai of
henri viii when those thing happen of which we have to tell for
here no larg town ha arisen nor have mine been dug or factori
built to affront the earth and defil the air with their hideous and
smoke
the villag of blossholm we know ha scarc vari in it popul
for the old record tell us thi and as there is no railwai here it
aspect must be much the same hous built of the local grei stone do
not readili fall down the folk of that gener walk in and out of
the doorwai of mani of them although the roof for the most part ar
now cover with tile or rough slate in place of reed from the dike
the parish well also fit with iron pump that have supersed the
old roller and bucket still serv the place with drinkingwat
as thei have done sinc the dai of the first edward and perhap for
centuri befor
although their us if not their necess ha pass awai not far
from the abbei gate the stock and whippingpost the latter arrang
with three set of iron loop fix at differ height and of vari
diamet to accommod the wrist of man woman and child mai still

rememb under a quaint old roof support on rough oaken pillar
and surmount by a weathercock which the monkish fanci ha fashion
to the shape of the archangel blow the last trump hi clarion
or coachhorn or whatev instrument of music it wa he blew ha

king henri viii as it is said to commemor the fact that on thi spot
stood the stake to which cice harflet ladi of blossholm and her
fostermoth emlyn were chain to be burn as witch
so it is with everyth at blossholm a place that time ha touch

ident in their shape and outlin the old farmstead and the few
hall in which resid the gentri of the district stand where thei

gentleman of larg estat in a rage remark even for the time of the
eighth henri he dash the document to the ground he drank three cup

were rough and thei were not sure who threaten them when thei knew
their visitor at last thei set to work to unbar the great door and let
down the drawbridg that had been hoist up at sunset
present sir john stood in the abbot chamber warm himself at the
great fire and behind him stood hi servingman jeffrei carri hi
long cloak it wa a fine room with a nobl roof of carv chestnut
wood and stone wall hung with costli tapestri whereon were work
scene from the scriptur the floor wa hid with rich carpet made of
colour eastern wool the furnitur also wa rich and foreignlook
be inlaid with ivori and silver while on the tabl stood a golden
crucifix a miracl of art and upon an easel so that the light from a
hang silver lamp fell on it a lifes pictur of the magdalen
by some great italian painter turn her beauteou ey to heaven and
beat her fair breast
sir john look about him and snif
now jeffrei would you think that you were in a monk cell or in some
great dame bower hunt under the tabl man sure you will find her
lute and needlework whose portrait is that think you and he point
to the magdalen
a sinner turn saint i think master good compani for laymen when
she wa sinner and good for priest now that she is saint for the
rest i could snore well here after a cup of yon red wine and he
jerk hi thumb toward a longneck bottl on a sideboard also
the fire burn bright which is not to be wonder at see that it is
made of dry oak from your stickslei wood
how know you that jeffrei ask sir john
by the grain of it masterbi the grain of it i have hewn too mani
a timber there not to know there that in the stickslei clai which
make the ring grow wavi and darker at the heart see there
sir john look and swore an angri oath
you ar right man and now i come to think of it when i wa a littl
lad my old grandsir bade me note thi veri thing about the stickslei
oak these curs monk wast my wood beneath my nose my forest is
a rogu thei have scare or bribe him and he shall hang for it
first prove the crime master which wont be easi then talk of
hang which onli king and abbot with right of gallow can do at
will ah you speak truth he ad in a chang voic it is a love
chamber though not good enough for the holi man who dwell in it
sinc such a saint should have a silver shrine like him befor the altar
yonder as doubtless he will do when er long he is old bone and
as though by chanc he trod upon hi lord foot which wa somewhat
gouti
round came sir john like the blossholm weathercock on a gusti dai
clumsi toad he yell then paus for there within the arra that
had been lift silent stood a tall tonsur figur cloth in rich
fur and behind him two other figur also tonsur in simpl black
robe it wa the abbot with hi chaplain
benedicit said the abbot in hi soft foreign voic lift the two
finger of hi right hand in bless
gooddai answer sir john while hi retain bow hi head and
cross himself why do you steal upon a man like a thief in the night
holi father he ad irrit
that is how we ar told judgment shall come my son answer the
abbot smile and in truth there seem some need of it we heard loud
quarrel and talk of hang men what is your argument
a hard on of oak answer old sir john sullenli my servant here
said those log upon your fire came from my stickslei wood and i
answer him that if so thei were stolen and my reev should hang for
it
the worthi man is right my son and yet your forest deserv no
punish i bought our scanti store of fire from him and to tell
truth the count ha not yet been paid the monei that should have
discharg it ha gone to london so i ask him to let it stand
until the summer rent come in blame him not sir john if out of
friendship know it wa naught to you he ha not bare the naked
of our poor hous

sumptuou chamberthat caus you to send me thi letter sai that
you have cromwel writ to seiz my land ask sir john rush at
hi grievanc like a bull and cast down the document upon the tabl
or do you also mean to make payment for themwhen your summer rent

nai son in that matter duti led me for twenti year we have disput
of those estat which as you know your grandsir took from us in
a time of troubl thu cut the abbei land in twain against the
protest of him who wa abbot in those dai therefor at last i laid
the matter befor the vicargener who i hear ha been pleas to
decid the suit in favour of thi abbei
to decid a suit of which the defend had no notic exclaim sir
john my lord abbot thi is not justic it is rogueri that i will
never bear did you decid aught els prai you
sinc you ask itsometh my son to save cost i laid befor him
the sundri point at issu between us and in sum thi is the judgment
your titl to all your blossholm land and those contigu total
eight thousand acr is not void yet it is held to be taint and
doubt
god blood why ask sir john
my son i will tell you repli the abbot gentli becaus within
a hundr year thei belong to thi abbei by gift of the crown and
there is no record that the crown consent to their alien
no record exclaim sir john when i have the indentur deed in my
strongbox sign by my greatgrandfath and the abbot frank ingham
no record when my said forefath gave you other land in place of them
which you now hold but go on holi priest
my son i obei you your titl though pronounc so doubt is not
utterli void yet it is held that you have all these land as tenant
of thi abbei to which should you die without issu thei will
relaps or should you die with issu under ag such issu will be ward
to the abbot of blossholm for the time be and fail him that is
if there were no abbot and no abbei of the crown
sir john listen then sank back into a chair while hi face went
white as ash

you seem faint the warmth of thi room after the cold outer air

on of the chaplain step to the sideboard fill a goblet from the
longneck flask that stood there and brought it to sir john

silver cup and it content into the fire whenc a chaplain recov
it with the woodtong

voic or so you sai and if that is so my life is like to be
short ill not drink your wine lest it should be poison hearken

all that dai sir john and jeffrei hi servingman trot forward
through the snowthat is when thei were not oblig to walk becaus
of the depth of the drift their plan wa to reach a certain farm in a
glade of the woodland within two hour of sundown and sleep there for
thei had taken the forest path leav again for the fen and cambridg
at the dawn thi howev prove not possibl becaus of the exceed
bad of the road so it came about that when the dark close in
on them a littl befor five oclock bring with it a cold
moan wind and a scurri of snow thei were oblig to shelter in a
faggotbuilt woodman hut wait for the moon to appear among the
cloud here thei fed the hors with corn that thei had brought with
them and themselv also from their store of dri meat and barlei
cake which jeffrei carri on hi shoulder in a bag it wa a poor
meal eaten thu in the dark but serv to stai their stomach and
pass awai the time
at length a rai of light pierc the doorwai of the hut
she up said sir john let us be go er the nag grow stiff
make no answer jeffrei slip the bit back into the hors mouth
and led them out now the full moon had appear like a great white ey
between two black bank of cloud and turn the world to silver it wa
a dreari scene on which she shone a dazzl plain of snow broken by
patch of hawthorn and here and there by the gaunt shape of a pollard
oak sinc thi be the outskirt of the forest folk came hither to
lop the top of the tree for fire a hundr and fifti yard awai
or so at the crest of a slope wa a roundshap hill made not by
natur but by man none knew what that hill might be but tradit
said that onc hundr or thousand of year befor a big battl
had been fought around it in which a king wa kill and that hi
victori armi had rais thi mound abov hi bone to be a memori
for ever
the stori wa inde that be a seak thei had built a boat or
drag it thither from the river shore and set him in it with all the
slain for rower also that he might be seen at night seat on hi
hors in armour and stare about him as when he direct the battl
at least it is true that the mount wa call king grave and that
peopl fear to pass it after sundown
as jeffrei stoke wa hold hi master stirrup for him to mount
he utter an exclam and point follow the line of hi
outstretch hand in the clear moonlight sir john saw a man who sat
still as ani statu upon a hors on the veri point of king grave
he appear to be cover with a long cloak but abov it hi helmet
glitter like silver next moment a fring of black cloud hid the face
of the moon and when it pass awai the man and hors were gone
what did that fellow there ask sir john
fellow answer jeffrei in a shaken voic i saw none that wa the
ghost of the grave my grandfath met him er he came to hi end in the
forest none know how for the wolv of which there were plenti in
hi dai pick hi bone clean and so have mani other for hundr of
year alwai just befor their doom he is an ill fowl that ghost
of the grave and those who clap ey on him do wise to turn their
hors head homeward as i would tonight if i had my wai master
what us jeffrei if the sight of him mean death death will come
moreov i believ noth of the tale your ghost wa some forest
reev or herdsman
a forest reev or herdsman who wander about in a steel helm on a fine
hors in snowtim when there ar no tree to cut or cattl to mind
well have it as you will master onli god save me from such reev and
herdmen for i think thei hail from hell
then he wa a spy watch whither we go answer sir john angrili
if so who sent him the abbot of blossholm in that case i would
sooner meet the devil for thi mean mischief i sai that we had better
ride back to shefton
then do so jeffrei if you ar scare and i will go on alon who
be on an honest busi fear not satan or an abbot either
nai master mani a year ago when we were younger i stood by you on
flodden field when sir edward christoph harflet father wa kill
at our side and those redbeard scotch barebreek press us hard
yet i never itch to turn my back even after that great fellow with an
ax got you down and we thought that all wa lost then shall i do
so nowthough it is true that i fear yon goblin more than all the
highland beyond the tweed ride on man can die but onc and for my
part i care not when it come who have littl to lose in an ill world
so without more word thei start forward peer about them as thei
went soon the forest thicken and the track thei follow wound it
wai round great trunk of primev oak or the edg of boghol or
through brake of thorn hard enough it wa to find it at time sinc
the snow made it on with the border ground and the gloom of the
oak wa great but jeffrei wa a woodman born and from hi childhood
had known the shape of everi tree in that wast so that thei held
safe to their road well would it have been for them if thei had not
thei came to a place where three other track cross that which thei
rode upon and here jeffrei stoke who wa ahead held up hi hand
what is it ask sir john
it is the mark of ten or a dozen shod hors pass within two hour
sinc the last snow fell and who be thei i wonder

mile ahead
then jeffrei broke out

jeffrei spur hi hors
thei went on through the dead winter silenc that wa broken onli by
the hoot of a flit owl hungri for the food that it could not find
and the swish of the feet of a gallop fox as it loop past them
through the snow present thei came to an open place ring in by
forest so wet that onli marshtre would grow there to their right
lai a littl icecov mere with sere brown reed stand here and
there upon it face and at the end of it a group of stark pollard
willow whereof the top had been cut for pole by those who dwelt in
the forest farm near by sir john look at the place and shiver a
littleperhap becaus the frost bit him or wa it that he rememb
hi daughter dream which told of such a spot at ani rate he set hi
teeth and hi right hand sought the hilt of hi sword hi weari hors
snif the air and neigh and the neigh wa answer from close at
hand

from out of the shelter of a thornbrak and the moonlight shone on the
bare weapon in their hand

the farm
the man hesit for he saw that their foe were mani and no common
robber but hi master drew hi sword and spur hi beast so he

hi stirrup cut him down he fell all of a heap and lai still in the
snow which grew crimson about him on came at jeffrei who turn hi
hors so that the blow miss then took hi weight upon the point of
hi sword so that thi man too fell down and lai in the snow move
feebli
the rest think thi greet too warm for them swung round and
vanish again among the thorn

then such a marriag duli solemn be a sacrament of the church
would hold fast until the crack of doom unless the pope annul it
and as you know the pope is out of favour in thi realm on thi veri
matter of marriag let me explain the law to you ecclesiast and

then he paus for a while and hear no dissent walk down the
hall and out of the door
emlyn took cice by the hand led her to a room that wa shown to them
and there made her readi for her bridal as best she might she had no
fine dress in which to cloth her nor inde would there have been
time to don it but she comb out her beauti brown hair and

a golden clasp while to her ear she hung the finest gem of alltwo
great pearl pink like the hawthornbloom when it begin to turn lastli

thei had seen their last of the tower for mani a dai but thi wa not
to be for as thei pass along the blossholm highwai purpos to
leav the abbei on their left when thei were about three mile from

a monk hood to it and carri a thick staff in hi hand burst through
the fenc and stood in front of them
who ar you ask christoph lai hi hand upon hi sword

sin to spare for a priest wallet and need a bless or two to warm

he strode forward and take her hors by the bridl led it a littl
wai apart and as soon as thei were out of earshot fell into an eager
convers with it rider a minut or so later cice look
roundfor thei had ridden forward at a slow pacesaw thoma boll
leap through the other fenc of the roadwai and vanish at a run into the
fall snow while emlyn spur her hors after them

the ladi cice by forc some spy ha told him of thi journei
i see no on said christoph stare at the grove which lai below
them about a quarter of a mile awai for thei were on the top of a rise
still the matter is not hard to prove and he call to the two best
mount of hi men and bade them ride forward and make report if ani
lurk behind that wood
so the men went off while thei remain where thei were silent but
anxiou enough ten minut or so later befor thei could see them for
the snow wa now fall quickli thei heard the sound of mani hors
gallop then the two men appear call out as thei came
the abbot and all hi folk ar after us back to cranwel er you be
taken
christoph thought for a moment then rememb that with but four
men and cumber by two women it wa not possibl to cut hi wai through
so great a forc and admonish by that sound of advanc hoof he
gave a sudden order thei turn about and not too soon for as thei
did so scarc two hundr yard awai the first of the abbot horsemen
appear plung toward them up the slope then the race began and
well for them wa it that their hors were good and fresh sinc befor
ever thei came in sight of cranwel tower the pursuer were not nineti
yard behind but here on the flat their beast scent home answer
nobli to whip and spur and drew ahead a littl moreov those who
watch within the hous saw them and ran to the drawbridg when thei
were within fifti yard of the moat cice hors stumbl slip
and fell throw her into the snow then recov itself and gallop
on alon christoph rein up alongsid of her and as she rose
frighten but unharm put out hi long arm and lift her to the
saddl in front of him plung forward while those behind shout
yield
under thi doubl burden hi hors went but slowli still thei reach
the bridg befor ani could lai hand upon them and thunder over it
wind up shout christoph and all there even the womenfolk laid
hand upon the crank the bridg began to rise but now five or six of
the abbot folk dismount sprang at it catch the end of it with
their hand when it wa about six feet in the air and hold on so
that it could not be lift but remain move neither up nor down
leav go you knave shout christoph but by wai of answer on
of them with the help of hi fellow scrambl on to the end of the
bridg and stood there hang to the chain
then christoph snatch a bow from the hand of a servingman and the
arrow be alreadi on the string again shout
get off at your peril
in answer the man call out someth about the command of the lord
abbot
christoph look past him saw that other of the compani had
dismount and were run toward the bridg if thei reach it he
knew well that the game wa plai so he hesit no longer but
aim swiftli drew and loos the bow at that distanc he could
not miss the arrow struck the man where hi steel cap join the mail
beneath and pierc him through the throat so that he fell back dead
the other scare by hi fate loos their hold so that now the
bridg reliev of the weight upon it instantli rose up beyond their
reach and present came home and wa made fast
as thei afterward discov thi man it mai here be said wa a
captain of the abbot guard moreov it wa he who had shot the arrow
that kill sir john foterel some forti hour befor strike him
through the throat as it wa fate that he himself should be struck
thu then on of that good knight murder reap hi just reward
now the men ran back out of rang for thei fear more arrow while
christoph watch them go in silenc cice who stood by hi side
her hand held befor her face to shut out the sight of death let them
fall suddenli and turn to her husband said as she point to the
corps that lai upon the bloodstain snow of the roadwai

the sens of thi manslai and knew not what he should do next he
saw three men separ from the knot of soldier and ride toward
the tower on of whom held a white cloth abov hi head in token
of parlei then christoph went up into the littl gatewai turret
follow by emlyn who crouch down behind the brick battlement so
that she could see and hear without be seen have reach the
further side of the moat he who held the white cloth threw back the
hood of hi long cape and thei saw that it wa the abbot of blossholm

honour as mai be the share of christoph harflet law wife if

fight the dread of which wa ever present but not it joi
meanwhil in other wai thing went ill with them thu first of all
their beer gave out and then such other cordial as thei had so that
thei were reduc to water to drink next their fuel becam exhaust
for nearli all the stock of it wa kept at the farmstead about a quarter
of a mile awai and on the second dai of the sieg thi stead wa fire
and burn with it content the cattl and hors be driven off
thei knew not where
so it came about at length thei could keep onli on fire in the
kitchen and that but small which in the end thei were oblig to feed
with the door of the outhous and even with the floor torn out of
the attic in order that thei might cook their food nor wa there
much of thi onli a store of salt meat and some pickl pork and smoke
bacon togeth with a certain amount of oatmeal and flour that thei
made into cake and bread
on the fourth dai howev these gave out so that thei were reduc to
a scanti diet of hung flesh with a few appl by wai of veget and
hot water to drink to warm them at length too there wa noth more
to burn and therefor thei must eat their meat raw and grew sick on
it moreov a cold thaw set in and the hous grew ici so that thei
move about it with chatter teeth and at night illnurtur as thei
were could scarc keep the life in them beneath all the cover which
thei had
ah how long were those night with never a blaze upon the hearth or so
much as a candl to light them at four oclock the dark came down
which did not lessen for the moon grew low and the mist were thick
until dai broke about seven on the follow morn and all thi time
fear attack thei must keep watch and ward through the gloom so that
even sleep wa deni them
for a while thei bore up brave even the tenant though new wa
shout to these that their stead had been harri and their wive and
children hunt off to seek shelter where thei might
cice and emlyn never murmur inde thi newmad wife kept her
dread honeymoon with a cheer face trudg through the black
hour around the circl of the moat at her husband side or from
windowplac to windowplac in the empti room till at length thei
cast themselv down upon some bed to sleep a while give over the
watch to other onli emlyn never seem to sleep but at length their
companion did begin to murmur
on morn at the dawn after a veri bitter night thei wait upon
christoph and told him that thei were will to fight for hi sake
and hi ladi but that as there wa no hope of help thei could no
longer freez and starv in short that thei must either escap from
the hous or surrend he listen to them patient know that
what thei said wa true and then consult for a while with cice and
emlyn
our case is desper dear wife now what shall we do who have no
chanc of succour sinc none know of our plight yield or strive to
escap through the dark
not yield i think answer cice choke back a sob if we yield
certainli thei will separ us and that merciless abbot will bring you
to your death and me to a nunneri
that mai happen in ani case mutter christoph turn hi head
asid but what sai you nurs
i sai fight for it answer emlyn boldli it is certain that we
cannot stai here for to be plain sir christoph there ar some
among us whom i do not trust what wonder their stomach ar empti
their hand ar blue their wive and children ar thei know not where
and the heavi curs of the church hang over them all of which thing
mai be mend if thei plai you fals let us take what hors remain and
slip awai at dead of night if we can or if we cannot then let us die
as mani better folk have done befor
so thei agre to try their fortun think that it wa so bad it
could not be wors and spent the rest of that dai in get readi
as best thei could the seven hors still stood in the stabl and
although thei were stiff from want of exercis had been hayf and
water on these thei propos to ride but first thei must tell the
truth to those who had stood by them so about three oclock of the
afternoon christoph call all the men togeth beneath the gatewai
and sorrowfulli set out hi tale here he show them thei could bide
no longer and to surrend meant that hi new wife would soon be
made a widow therefor thei must fly take with them as mani as there
were hors for them to ride if thei care to risk such a journei if
not he and the two women would go alon
now four of the stoutestheart of them men who had serv him and
hi father for mani year step forward sai that evil as these
seem to be thei would follow hi fortun to the last he thank
them shortli whereon on of the other ask what thei were to do and
if he propos to desert them after lead them into thi plight
god know i would rather die he repli with a swell heart but
my friend consid the case if i bide here what of my wife ala it
ha come to thi that you must choos whether you will slip out with us
and scatter in the wood where i think you will not be follow sinc
yonder abbot ha no quarrel against you or whether you will wait here
and tomorrow at the dawn surrend in either event you can sai that
i compel you to stand by us and that you have shed no man blood
also i will give you a write
so thei talk togeth gloomili and at last announc that when he and
their ladi went thei would go also and get off as best thei could but
there wa a man among them a small farmer name jonathan dicksei who
thought otherwis thi jonathan who held hi land under christoph
had been forc to thi busi of the defenc of cranwel tower
somewhat against hi will name by the pressur of christoph
largest tenant to whose daughter he wa affianc he wa a sly young
man and even dure the sieg by mean that need not be describ he
had contriv to convei a messag to the abbot of blossholm tell
him that had it been in hi power he would gladli be in ani other place
therefor as he knew well whatev had happen to other hi farm
remain unharri now he determin to be out of a bad busi as
soon as he might for jonathan wa on of those who like to stand upon
the win side
therefor although he said ay ay more loudli than hi comrad
as soon as the dusk had fallen while the other were make readi the
hors and mount guard jonathan thrust a ladder across the moat at
the back of the stabl and clamber along it rung into the shelter
of a cattlesh in the meadow and so awai
halfanhour later he stood befor the abbot in the cottag where he had
taken up hi quarter have contriv to blunder among hi peopl and
be captur to him at first jonathan would sai noth but when at
length thei threaten to take him out and hang him to save hi life
as he said he found hi tongu and told all
so so said the abbot when he had finish now god is good to
us we have these bird in our net and i shall keep st hilari at
blossholm after all for your servic master dicksei you shall be my
reev at cranwel tower when thei ar in my hand
but here it mai be said that in the end thing went otherwis sinc so
far from get the stewardship of cranwel when the truth came to be
known jonathan maiden would have no more to do with him and the folk
in those part sack hi farm and hunt him out of the countri so
that he wa never heard of among them again
meanwhil all be readi christoph at the tower wa closet with
cice take hi farewel of her in the dark for no light wa left to
them
thi is a desper ventur he said to her nor can i tell how it
will end or if ever i shall see your sweet face again yet dearest we
have been happi togeth for some few hour and if i fall and you live
on i am sure that you will alwai rememb me till as we ar taught
we meet again where no enemi ha the power to torment us and cold and
hunger and dark ar not cice if that should be so and ani child
should come to you teach it to love the father whom it never saw
now she threw her arm about him and wept and wept and wept
if you die she sob sure i will do so also for although i am
but young i find thi world a veri evil place and now that my father is
gone without you husband it would be a hell

now sweet
ay if you will swear it also for i mai be taken and you left in the
dark sword do not choos let us promis that we will both endur our
live togeth or separ until god call us
so thei swore there in the ici gloom and seal the oath with kiss
now the time wa come at last and thei crept their wai to the courtyard
hand in hand take some comfort becaus the night wa veri favour
to their project the snow had melt and a great gale blew from the
souwest boister but not cold which caus the tall elm that
stood about to screech and groan like thing aliv in such a wind as
thi thei were sure that thei would not be heard nor could thei be seen
beneath that murki starless sky while the rain which fell between the
gust would wash out the footprint of their hors
thei mount silent and with the four menfor by now all the
rest had gonerod across the drawbridg which had been lower in
prepar for their flight three hundr yard or so awai their road
ran through an ancient marlpit work out gener befor in which
selfsown tree grew on either side of the path as thei drew near thi
place suddenli in the silenc of the night a hors neigh ahead of
them and on of their beast answer to the neigh
halt whisper cice whose ear were made sharp by fear i hear
men move
thei pull rein and listen ye between the gust of wind there wa
a faint sound as of the clank of armour thei strain their ey
in the dark but could see noth again the hors neigh and wa
answer on of their servant curs the beast beneath hi breath and
struck it savag with the flat of hi sword whereon be fresh
it took the bit between it teeth and bolt anoth minut and there
aros a great clamour from the marlpit in front of thema nois of
shout of swordstrok and then a heavi groan as from the lip of
a dy man
an ambush exclaim christoph
can we get round ask cice and there wa terror in her voic
nai he answer the stream is in flood we should be bog hark
thei charg us back to the towersther is no other wai
so thei turn and fled follow by shout and the thunder of mani
hors gallop in two minut thei were there and across the
bridgeth women christoph and the three men who were left
up with the bridg cri christoph and thei leapt from their
saddl and fumbl for the crank too late for alreadi the abbot
horsemen press it down
then a fight began the hors of the enemi shrank back from the
trembl bridg so their rider dismount rush forward to be
met by christoph and hi three remain men who in that narrow
place were as good as a hundr wild random blow were struck in the
dark and as it chanc two of the abbot peopl fell whereon a
deep voic cri
come back and wait for light
when thei had gone drag off their wound with them christoph
and hi servant again strove to wind up the bridg onli to find that
it would not stir
some traitor ha foul the chain he said in the quiet voic of
despair cice and emlyn get you into the hous i and ani who will
bide with me stai here to see thi busi out when i am down yield
yourself afterward i think that the king will give you justic if you
can come to him
ill not go she wail ill die with you
nai you shall go he said stamp hi foot and as he spoke
an arrow hiss between them emlyn drag her henc er she is shot
swift i sai swift or god curs and mine rest on you unclasp your
arm wife how can i fight while you hang about my neck what must i
strike you then there and there
she loos her grasp and groan fell back upon the breast of emlyn
who half led half carri her across the courtyard where their scare
hors gallop loos
whither go we sob cice
to the central tower answer emlyn it seem safest there
to thi tower whenc the place took it name thei grope their wai
unlik the rest of the hous which for the most part wa of wood it
wa built of stone be part of an older fabric date from the norman
dai slowli thei stumbl up the step till at length thei reach the
roof for some instinct prompt them to find a spot whenc thei
could see should the star break out here on thi lofti perch thei
crouch them down and wait the end whatev it might bewait in
silenc
a while passedthei never knew how longtil at length a sudden flame
shot up abov the roof of the kitchen at the rear which the wind
caught and blew on to the timber of the main build so that
present thi began to blaze also the hous had been fire by whom
wa never known though it wa said that the traitor jonathan dicksei
had return and done it either for a bribe or that hi own sin might
be forgotten in thi great catastroph
the hous burn said emlyn in her quiet voic now if you would
save your life follow me beneath thi tower is a vault where no flame
can touch us
but cice would not stir for by the fierc and evergrow light she
could see what pass beneath and as it chanc the wind blew the
smoke awai from them there beyond the drawbridg were gather the
abbei guard and there in the gatewai stood christoph and hi three
men with drawn sword while in the courtyard the hors gallop madli
scream in their fear a soldier look up and saw the two women
stand on the top of the tower then call out someth to the
abbot who sat on horseback near to him he look and saw also
yield sir christoph he shout the ladi cice burn yield
that we mai save her
christoph turn and saw also for a moment he hesit then wheel
round to run across the courtyard too late for as he came the flame
burst through the main roof of the hous and the timber front of it
blaze furious fell outward block the doorwai so that the
place becam a furnac into which none might enter and live
now a mad seem to take hold of him for a moment he stare up at
the figur of the two women stand high abov the roll smoke and
wrap flame then with hi three men he charg with a roar into
the crowd of soldier who had follow him into the courtyard strive
it would seem to cut hi wai to the abbot who lurk behind it wa
a dread sight for he and those with him fought furious and mani
went down present of the four onli christoph wa left upon hi
feet sword and spear smote upon hi armour but he did not fall
it wa those in front of him who fell a great fellow with an ax
got behind him and struck with all hi might upon hi helm the sword
drop from harflet hand slowli he turn about look upward
then stretch out hi arm and fell heavili to earth
the abbot leapt from hi hors and ran to him kneel at hi side
dead he cri and began to shrive hi pass soul or so it seem
dead repeat emlyn and a gallant death
dead wail cice in so terribl a voic that all below heard it
dead dead and sank senseless on emlyn breast
at that moment the rest of the roof fell in hide the tower in spout
and veil of flame here thei might not stai if thei would live lift
her mistress in her strong arm as she wa wont to do when she wa
littl emlyn found the head of the stair so that when the wind blew
the smoke asid for an instant those below saw that both had vanish
as thei thought wither in the fire
now you can enter on the shefton land abbot cri a voic from the
dark of the gatewai though in the turmoil none knew who spoke but
not for all england would i bear that innoc blood
the abbot face turn ghastli and though it wa hot enough in that
courtyard hi teeth chatter
it is on the head of thi womanthief he exclaim with an effort
look down on christoph who lai at hi feet take him up that
inquest mai be held on him who di do murder can none enter the
hous hi pocket full of gold to him who save the ladi cice
can ani enter hell and live answer the same voic out of the
smoke and gloom seek her sweet soul in heaven if you mai come there
abbot
then with scare face thei lift up christoph and the other dead
and wound and carri them awai leav cranwel tower to burn
itself to ash for so fierc wa the heat that none could bide there
longer
two hour had gone by the abbot sat in the littl room of a cottag
at cranwel that he had occupi dure the sieg of the tower it wa
near midnight yet weari as he wa he could not rest inde had the
night been less foul and dark he would have spent the time in ride
back to blossholm hi heart wa ill at eas thing had gone well with
him it is true sir john foterel wa deadslain by outlaw
men sir christoph harflet wa deaddid not hi bodi lie in the
neathous yonder cice daughter of the on and wife to the other
wa dead also burn in the fire at the tower so that doubtless the
preciou gem and the wide land he covet would fall into hi lap
without further troubl for cromwel be bribe who would try to
snatch them from the power abbot of blossholm and had he not a
titl to themof a sort
and yet he wa veri ill at eas for as that voic had saidwhos
voic wa it he wonder somehow it seem familiarth blood of
these peopl lai on hi head and there came into hi mind the text of
holi writ which he had quot to christoph that he who shed man
blood by man should hi blood be shed also although he had paid the
vicargener to back him monk were in no great favour at the english
court and if thi stori travel there as it might for even the
strengthless dead find friend it wa possibl that question would be
ask question hard to answer befor heaven he could justifi himself
for all that he had done but befor king henri who would usurp the
power of the veri pope if the truth should chanc to reach the royal
earah that wa anoth matter
the room wa cold after the heat of that great fire hi southern blood
which had been warm enough grew chill loneli and depress took
hold of him he began to wonder how far in the ey of god abov the end
justifi the mean he open the door of the place and hold on
to it lest the rough wintri gale should tear it from it frail hing
shout aloud for brother martin on of hi chaplain
present martin arriv emerg from the cattlesh a lantern in hi
handa tall thin man with perplex and melancholi ey long nose
and a clever faceand bow ask hi superior pleasur
my pleasur brother answer the abbot is that you shut the door
and keep out the wind for thi accurs climat is kill me ye

flesh thi is fridai
fridai or no we have touch fleshth flesh of menup at the tower

the lean monk bow and take a hunch of bread began to bite at it
for he wa almost starv
have you come from watch by the bodi of that bloodi and rebelli
man who ha work us so much harm and loss ask the abbot present
the secretari nod then swallow a crust said
ay i have been prai over him and the other at least he wa
brave and it must be hard to see on new wife burn like a witch
also now that i come to studi the matter i know not what hi sin wa
who did but fight brave when he wa attack for without doubt the
marriag is good and whether he should have wait to ask your leav
to make it is a point that might be debat through everi court in
christendom
the abbot frown not appreci thi open and judici tone in
matter that touch him so nearli
you have honour me of late by choos me as on of your confessor
though i think you do not tell me everyth my lord abbot therefor i
bare my mind to you continu brother martin apologet
speak on then man what do you mean
i mean that i do not like thi busi he answer slowli in the
interv of munch at hi bread you had a quarrel with sir john
foterel about those land which you sai belong to the abbei god know
the right of it for i understand no law but he deni it for did
i not hear it yonder in your chamber at blossholm he deni it and
accus you of treason enough to hang all blossholm of which again
god know the truth you threaten him in your anger but he and hi
servant were arm and won out and next dai the two of them rode for
london with certain paper well that night sir john foterel wa
kill in the forest though hi servant stoke escap with the paper
now who kill him
the abbot look at him then seem to take a sudden resolut
our peopl those menatarm whom i have gather for the defenc of
our hous and the church my order to them were to seiz him live
but the old english bull would not yield and fought so fierc that it
end otherwiseto my sorrow
the monk put down hi bread for which he seem to have no further
appetit
a dread deed he said for which on dai you must answer to god
and man
for which we all must answer correct the abbot down to the last
laybroth and soldiery as much as ani of us brother for were you

maldon sarcast well what doe it matter see that death ha

earth oh i like it not i like it not and i mourn for those two so
love brave and young their blood and that of mani more is on our
handsfor what a stretch of upland and of marsh which the king or
other mai seiz tomorrow
the abbot seem to cower beneath the weight of these sad earnest
word and for a littl while there wa silenc then he pluck up
courag and said
i am glad that you rememb that their blood is on your hand as well
as mine sinc now perhap you will keep them hidden
he rose and walk to the door and the window to see that none were
without then return and exclaim fierc
fool do you then think that these deed were done to win a new
estat true it is that those land ar our by right and we need their
revenu but there is more behind the whole church of thi realm is
threaten by that accurs son of belial who sit upon the throne why

christoph where it lai on the filthi floor of the neathous by the
light of the lantern with deft finger he felt hi wound head from
which the shatter casqu had been remov and afterward hi heart
and puls
the skull is cut but not broken he said my judgment is that though

with ointment and bound up and milk pour down hi throat which he
swallow although he wa so senseless the abbot look at him said
to martin

man ly in that shed andrew wood my servant the scotch soldier
whom harflet slew he ha no friend here to claim him and these two

emlyn curs
just befor the wild dawn broke on the morrow of the burn of the
tower a corps roughli shroud wa born from the villag into the
churchyard of cranwel where a shallow grave had been dug for it last
home
whom do we buri in such hast ask the tall thoma boll who had
delv the grave alon in the dark for hi order were urgent and the
sexton wa fled awai from these tumult

than he us to be troubl and hunger in those burnt tower i suppos
why did thei not set him in the vault with hi ancestor it would have

and to let out the soul of certain holi monk or rather of their hire
ruffler for monk dont fight becaus thei wish to separ those
whom godi mean the devilhad join togeth and to add their
tempor to the estat of mother church
then the old priest who wa shiver with cold and understood littl
of thi dark talk began to mumbl hi ritual skip those part
of it which he could not rememb so anoth grain wa plant in the
cornfield of death and immort though when and where it should
grow and what it should bear he neither knew nor care who wish to
escap from fear and fight back to hi accustom cell
it wa done and he and the bearer depart beat their wai against
the rough raw wind and leav thoma boll to fill in the grave
which so long as thei were in sight or rather hear he did with
much vigour when thei were gone howev he descend into the hole
under pretenc of trampl the loos soil and there to be out of the
wind sat himself down upon the feet of the corps and wait full of
reflect
sir christoph dead he mutter to himself i knew hi grandfath
when i wa a lad and my grandfath told me that he knew hi
grandfath greatgrandfathersai three hundr year of themand
now i sit on the cold toe of the last of the lot butcher like a mad
ox in hi own yard by a spanish priest and hi hirel to win hi
wife good oh ye it is wonder all veri wonder and the ladi
cice dead burnt like a common witch and emlyn deademlyn whom i
have hug mani a time in thi veri churchyard befor thei whip her
into marri that fat old griev and made a monk of me
well i had her first kiss and by the saint how she curs old
stower all the wai down yonder path i stood behind that tree and heard
her she said he would die soon and he did and hi brat with him she
said she would danc on hi grave and she did i saw her do it in the
moonlight the night after he wa buri dress in white she danc on
hi grave she alwai kept her promis did emlyn that her blood
if her mother had not been a gypsi witch she wouldnt have marri a
spaniard when everi man in the place wa after her for her beauti
ey emlyn is a witch too or wa for thei sai she is dead but i
cant think it she isnt the sort that di still she must be dead
and that good for my soul oh miser man what ar you think

witch sinc after you i could never fanci ani other woman which is

witch of the worst sort but my darl witch or no i wish you werent
dead and ill break that abbot neck for you yet if it cost me my
soul oh emlyn my darl my darl do you rememb how we kiss
in the cops by the river never wa there a woman who could love like
you
so he moan on rock himself to and fro on the leg of the corps
till at length a wild rai from the red risen sun crept into the
darksom hole light first of all upon a moulder skull which boll
had thrown back among the soil he rose up and pitch it out with a
word that should not have pass the lip of a laybroth even as such
thought should not have pass hi mind then he set himself to a task
which he had plan in the interv of hi amor meditationsa
somewhat grizzli task
draw hi knife from it sheath he cut the rough stitch of the
gravecloth and with numb hand drag them awai from the bodi
head
the light went out behind a cloud but not to wast time he began to
feel the face
sir christoph nose wasnt broken he mutter to himself unless
it were in that last frai and then the bone would be loos and thi is
stiff no no he had a veri pretti nose
the light came again and thoma peer down at the dead face beneath
him then suddenli burst into a hoars laugh
by all the saint here anoth of our spaniard trick it is
drunken andrew the scotchman turn into a dead english knight
christoph kill him and now he is christoph but where
christoph
he thought a littl while then jump out of the grave began to fill
it in with all hi might
your christoph he said well stop christoph until i can prove
your andrew goodby sir andrew christoph i am off to seek your
better if you ar dead who mai not be aliv emlyn herself perhap
after thi oh the devil is plai a merri game round old cranwel
tower tonight and thoma boll will take a hand in it
he wa right the devil wa plai a merri game at least so thought
other besid thoma for instanc that misguid but honest bigot
martin as he contempl the still senseless form of christoph who
rechristen brother luiz had been safe convei aboard the great
yarmouth and now whether dead or live which he wa not sure lai
in the littl cabin that had been allot to the two of them almost
did martin as he look at him and shook hi bald head seem to smell
brimston in that close place which as he knew well wa the fiend
favourit scent
the captain also a sourfac marin with a squint known in dunwich
whenc he hail as miser goodi becaus of hi earnest in pursu
wealth and hi skill in hoard it seem to feel the unhallow
influenc of hi satan majesti so far everyth had gone wrong upon
thi voyag which alreadi had been delai six week that is till the
veri worst period of the year while he wait for certain mysteri
letter and cargo which hi owner said he must carri to sevil then
he had sail out of the river with a fair wind onli to be beaten back
by fear weather that nearli sank the ship
item six of hi best men had desert becaus thei fear a trip to
spain at that season and he had been oblig to take other at hazard
among them wa a broadshould blackbeard fellow clad in a
leather jerkin with spur upon hi heelsbloodi spursthat he seem
to have found no time to take off thi hard rider came aboard in
a skiff after the anchor wa up and have cast the skiff adrift
offer good monei for a passag to spain or ani other foreign port and
paid it down upon the nail he goodi had taken the monei though with
a doubt heart and given a receipt to the name of charl smith
ask no question sinc for thi gold he need not account to the
owner afterward also the man have put off hi spur and soldier
jerkin set himself to work among the crew some of whom seem to know
him and in the storm that follow show that he wa stoutheart and
us though not a skill sailor
still he mistrust him of charl smith and hi bloodi spur and
had he not been so shorthand and taken the knave broad piec would
have like to set him ashor again when thei were driven back into the
river especi as he heard that there had been manslai about
blossholm and that sir john foterel lai slaughter in the forest
perhap thi charl smith had murder him well if so it wa no
affair of hi and he could not spare a hand
now when at length the weather had moder just as he wa haul
up hi anchor come the abbot of blossholm on whose will he had been
bidden to wait with a leanfac monk and anoth passeng said to be
a sick religi wrap up in blanket and to all appear dead
why wonder that astut marin goodi should a sick monk wear
har for he felt it through the blanket as he help him up the
ladder although monk shoe were stuck upon hi feet and why as he
saw when the cover slip asid for a moment wa hi crown bound up
with bloodi cloth
inde he ventur to question the abbot as to thi mysteri matter
while hi lordship wa pai the passag monei in hi cabin onli to
get a veri sharp answer
were you not command to obei me in all thing captain goodi and
doe obedi lie in pry out my busi anoth word and i will
report you to those in spain who know how to deal with mischiefmak
if you would see dunwich again hold your peac
your pardon my lord abbot said goodi but thing go so upon thi
ship that i grow afraid that is an ill voyag upon which on lift
anchor twice in the same port
you will not make them go better captain by seek to nose out my
affair and those of the church do you desir that i should lai it
curs upon you
nai your rever i desir that you should take the curs off
answer goodi who wa veri superstiti do that and ill carri
a dozen sick priest to spain even though thei choos to wear chain
shirtsfor penanc
the abbot smile then lift hi hand pronounc some word
in latin which as he did not understand them goodi found veri
comfort as thei pass hi lip the great yarmouth began to move
for the sailor were hoist up her anchor
as i do not accompani you on thi voyag fare you well he said the
saint go with you as shall my prayer sinc you will not pass the
gibraltar strait where i hear mani infidel pirat lurk given good
weather your voyag should be safe and easi again farewel i commend
brother martin and our sick friend to your keep and shall ask
account of them when we meet again
i prai it mai not be thi side of hell for i do not like that spanish
abbot and hi passeng dead or live thought goodi to himself as
he bow him from the cabin
a minut later the abbot after a few earnest hurri word with
martin began to descend the ladder to the boat that man by hi own
peopl wa alreadi be drawn slowli through the water as he did so
he glanc back and in the cling mist of dawn which wa almost as
dens as wool caught sight of the face of a man who had been order to
hold the ladder and knew it for that of jeffrei stoke who had escap
from the slai of sir johnescap with the damn paper that had
cost hi master life ye jeffrei stoke no other hi lip shape
themselv to call out someth but befor ever a syllabl had pass
them an accid happen
to the abbot it seem as though the whole ship had struck him violent
behindso violent that he wa propel headfirst among the rower in
the boat and lai there hurt and breathless
what is it call the captain who heard the nois
the abbot slip or the ladder slip i know not which answer
jeffrei gruffli stare at the toe of hi seaboot at least he is
safe enough in the boat now and turn he vanish aft into the
mist mutter to himself
a veri good kick though a littl high yet i wish it had been off
anoth kind of ladder that murder rogu would look well with a rope
round hi neck still i dare do no more and it serv to stop hi ly
mouth befor he betrai me oh my poor master my poor old master
bruis and sore as he wasand he wa veri sorewithin littl over
an hour abbot maldon wa back at the ruin of cranwel tower it seem
strang that he should go there but in truth hi uneasi heart would
not let him rest hi plan had succeed onli far too well sir john
foterel wa deada crime no doubt but necessari for had the knight
live to reach london with that evid in hi pocket hi own life and
those of mani other might have paid the price of it sinc who know
what truth mai be twist from a victim on the rack maldon had alwai
fear the rack it wa a nightmar that haunt hi sleep although the
ambiti cun of hi natur and the caus he serv with heart and
soul prompt him to put himself in continu danger of that fate
in an unguard moment when hi tongu wa loos with wine he had
place himself in the power of sir john foterel hope to win him to
the side of spain and afterward forget it made of him a dread
enemi therefor thi enemi must die for had he live not onli
might he himself have di in place of him but all hi plan for the
rebellion of the church against the crown must have come to noth
ye ye that deed wa law and pardon for it assur should the
truth becom known till thi morn he had hope that it never would
be known but now jeffrei stoke had escap upon the ship great
yarmouth
oh if onli he had seen him a minut earlier if onli somethingcould
it have been that impiou knave jeffrei he wonderedhad not struck
him so violent in the back and hurl him to the boat where he lai
almost senseless till the vessel had glide from them down the river
well she wa gone and jeffrei in her he wa but a common servingman
after all who if he knew anyth would never have the wit to us
hi knowledg although it wa true he had been wise enough to fly from
england
no paper had been discov upon sir john bodi and no monei
without doubt the old knight had found time to pass them on to jeffrei
who now fled the kingdom disguis as a sailor oh what ill chanc had
put him on board the same vessel with sir christoph harflet
well sir christoph would probabl die were brother martin a littl
less of a fool he would certainli die but the fact remain that thi
monk though abl in such matter wa a fool with a conscienc that
would not suit itself to circumst if christoph could be save
martin would save him as he had alreadi save him in the shed even if
he hand him over to the inquisit afterward still he might slip
through hi finger or the vessel might be lost as wa devoutli to be
prai and seem not unlik at thi season of the year also the
first opportun must be taken to send certain messag to spain that
might result in hamper the activ of brother martin and of sir
christoph harflet if he live to reach that land
meanwhil reflect maldon other thing had gone wrong he had wish
to proclaim hi wardship over cice and to immur her in a nunneri
becaus of her great possess which he need for the caus but he
had not wish her death inde he wa fond of the girl whom he had
known from a child and her innoc blood wa a weight that he ill
could bear he who at heart alwai shrank from the shed of blood
still heaven had kill her not he and the matter could not now be
mend also as she wa dead her inherit would he thought fall
into hi hand without further troubl for hea mitr abbot with a
seat among the lord of the realmhad friend in london who for a
fee could stifl inquiri into all thi faroff busi
no no he must not be faintheart who after all had much for which
to be thank meanwhil the caus went onthat great caus of the
threaten church to which he had devot hi life henri the heret
would fall the spanish emperor whose spy he wa and who love him
well would invad and take england he would yet live to see the holi
inquisit at work at westminst and himselfy himself had it
not been hint to himenthron at canterburi the cardin red hat
he covet upon hi head andoh gloriou thoughtperhap afterward
wear the tripl crown at rome
rain wa fall heavili when the abbot with hi escort of two monk
and halfadozen menatarm rode up to cranwel the hous wa now but
a smoke heap of ash mingl with char beam and burnt clai in
the midst of which scarc visibl through the cloud of steam
caus by the fall rain rose the grim old norman tower for on it
stonework the flame had beat vainli
why have we come here ask on of the monk survei the dismal
scene with a shudder
to seek the bodi of the ladi cice and her woman and give them
christian burial answer the abbot
after bring them to a most unchristian death mutter the monk to
himself then ad aloud you were ever charit my lord abbot and
though she defi you such is that nobl ladi due as for the nurs
emlyn she wa a witch and did but come to the end that she deserv
if she be realli dead
what mean you ask the abbot sharpli
i mean that be a witch the fire mai have turn from her
prai god then that it turn from her mistress also but it cannot
be onli a fiend could have live in the heat of that furnac look
even the tower is gut
no it cannot be answer the monk so sinc we shall never find
them let us chant the burial offic over thi great grave of their and
begoneth sooner the better for yon place ha a haunt look
not till we have search out their bone which must be beneath the
tower yonder whereon we saw them last repli the abbot ad in
a low voic rememb brother the ladi cice had jewel of great
price which if thei were wrap in leather the fire mai have spare
and these ar among our heritag at shefton thei cannot be found
therefor thei must be here and the seek of them is no task for
common folk that is why i hurri hither so fast do you understand
the monk nod hi head have dismount thei gave their hors to
the servingmen and began to make an examin of the ruin the abbot
lean on hi inferior arm for he wa in great pain from the blow
in the back that jeffrei had administ with hi seaboot and the
bruis which he had receiv in fall to the boat
first thei pass under the gatehous which still stood onli to find
that the courtyard beyond wa so choke with smoulder rubbish that
thei could make no entryfor it will be rememb that the hous had
fallen outward here howev ly by the carcass of a hors thei
found the bodi of on of the men whom christoph had kill in hi last
stand and caus it to be born out then follow by their peopl
leav the dead man in the gatewai thei walk round the ruin keep
on the inner side of the moat till thei came to the littl pleasaunc
garden at it back
look said the monk in a frighten voic point to some scorch
bush that had been a bower
the abbot did so but for a while could see noth becaus of the
wreath of steam present a puff of wind blew these asid and there
stand hand in hand he beheld the figur of two women hi men
beheld them also and call aloud that these were the ghost of cice
and emlyn as thei spoke the figur still hand in hand began to walk
toward them and thei saw that thei were cice and emlyn inde but
in the flesh quit unharm
for a moment there wa deep silenc then the abbot ask
whenc come you mistress cice
out of the fire she answer in a small cold voic
out of the fire how did you live through the fire
god sent hi angel to save us she answer again in that small
voic
a miracl mutter the monk a true miracl
or mayhap emlyn stower witchcraft exclaim on of the men behind
and maldon start at hi word
lead me to my husband my lord abbot lest think me dead hi heart
should break said cice
now again there wa silenc so deep that thei could hear the patter of
everi drop of fall rain twice the abbot strove to speak but could
not but at the third effort hi word came

ravish wa slain in the frai last night cice foterel

me that though i seem to see him fall christoph is aliv upon the
earthy and other thing mani other thing and she pass her

the abbot turn on her and revil her
woman he said if she is a witch your the familiar and certainli
you shall burn even though she escap it is you who taught her how to
call up the devil

the abbot groan like most spaniard he wa emot and could not
help it hi bitter burst from hi heart
emlyn laugh at him
see how the wise and mighti of thi world overshoot themselv she
said clement maldonado i have known you for some twenti year and

miseri on some and on your own soul damnat without end though had
you but been wise and consult mewhi thei or some of them might
have been your sir john wa no fool he would have part with a pearl
or two of which he did not know the valu to end a feud against
the church and safeguard hi titl and hi daughter and now in your

pull down a king oh had you but guess it youd have hack off
the hand that put a torch to cranwel tower for now the gold you need

the abbot who had listen to thi long and bitter speech in patienc
groan again

chapter viii
emlyn call her man
on by on the week pass over the head of cice and emlyn in their
prison and brought them neither hope nor tide inde although thei
could not see it cord thei felt that the evil net which held them wa
draw ever tighter there were fear and piti as well as love in the
ey of mother matilda when she look at cice which she did onli if
she thought that no on observ her the nun also were afraid though
it wa clear that thei knew not of what on even emlyn find the
prioress alon sprang question on her ask what wa in the wind
and why her ladi a free woman of full ag wa detain there against
her will
the old nun face grew secret she answer that she did not know of
anyth unusu and that as regard the detent she must obei the
command of her spiritu superior
then burst out emlyn i tell you that you do so at your peril i
tell you that whether my ladi live or di there ar those who will
call you to a strict account ay and those who will listen to the
prayer of the helpless mother matilda england is not the land it wa
when as a girl thei buri you in these mouldi wall where doe god sai
that you have the right to hold free women like felon in a jail tell
me
i cannot moan mother matilda wring her thin hand the right
is veri hard to find thi place is strictli guard and whatev i mai
think i must do what i am bid lest my soul should suffer
your soul you cloister women think alwai of your miser soul
but of those of other folk ay and of their bodi too noth then
youll not help me
i cannot i cannot who am myself in bond she repli again
so be it mother then ill help myself and when i do god help you
all and with a contemptu shrug of her broad shoulder she walk
awai leav the poor old prioress almost in tear
emlyn threat were bold as her own heart but how could she execut
even a tenth of them the right wa on their side inde but as
mani a captiv ha found in those and other dai right is no joshua
trumpet to caus high wall to fall moreov cice would not aid her
now that her husband wa dead she took interest in on thing onlyhi
child who wa to be
for the rest she seem to care noth sinc she had no friend with
whom she could commun and her wealth as she understood had been
taken from her what better place she ask could there be for that
child to see the light than in thi quiet nunneri when it wa born and
she wa well again she would consid other matter meanwhil she wa
languid and why wa emlyn alwai prate to her of freedom if she were
free what should she do and whither should she go the nun were veri
kind to her thei love her as she did them
so she talk on and emlyn listen did not dare to tell her the
truth that here she fear for the life of her child dread lest
that new might bring about the death of both of them so she let her
be and fell back on her own wit
first she thought of escap onli to abandon the idea for her mistress
wa in no state to face it peril moreov whither should thei go
then rescu came into her mind but ala who would rescu them the
great men in london perhap as a matter of polici but great men ar
hard to come at even for the free if she were free she might find
mean to make them listen but she wa not nor could she leav her ladi
at such a time what remain then so to contriv that thei should be
set free
perhap it might be done at a pricethat of cice jewel of which
she alon knew the hidingplac and with them a deed of indemn
against her persecutor emlyn wa not mind to give either moreov
she guess that it might be in vain onc outsid those wall thei
knew too much to be allow to live and yet within those wall cice
child would not be allow to liveth child that wa heir to all
what then could loos them and make them safe
terror perhapssuch terror as that through which the israelit
escap from bondag oh if she could but find a mose to call down the
plagu of egypt upon thi pharaoh of an abbotthos plagu with which
she had threaten himbut although she believ that thei would fall
why did she believ it she wonder she wa as yet impot to
fulfil
now thoma boll if onli she could have word with that faith thoma
boll the fierc and cun man whom thei thought foolish
thi idea of thoma boll took possess of emlyn mindthoma boll
who had love her all hi life who would die to serv her she strove
in vain to get in touch with him the old garden wa so deaf that he
could not or would not understand the silli bridget gave the letter
that she wrote to him to the prioress by mistak who burnt it befor
her ey and said noth the monk who brought provis to the
nunneri were alwai receiv by three of the sister set to spy on each
other and on them so that she could not come near to them alon the
priest who celebr mass wa an old enemi of her with him she could
do noth and no on els wa allow to approach the place except
onc or twice the abbot who wa closet for hour with the prioress
but spoke to her no more
why wonder emlyn should less than halfamil of space be such a
barrier between her and thoma boll if he stood within twenti yard of
her she could make him understand why not then when he stood within
five hundr thi idea possess her these limit of natur made
her mad she refus to accept them night by night ly brood
in her bed while cice slept in peac at her side she threw out her
strong soul toward the soul of her old lover thoma boll command
him to listen to obei to come
at first noth happen afterward she had a vagu sens of be
answer although she could not see or hear him she felt hi presenc
then on afternoon look from an upper dormer window she saw a
scuffl go on outsid the gatewai and heard angri voic thoma
boll wa try to forc hi wai in at the door whenc he wa repel
by the abbot men who alwai watch there
in the even she gather the truth from the nun who did not know
that she wa listen to what thei said it seem that thoma whom
thei spoke of as a madman or as drunk had tri to break into the
nunneri when he wa ask what he want he answer that he did not
know but he must speak with emlyn stower at thi tide she smile to
herself for now she knew that he had heard her and that in thi wai or
in that he would obei her summon and come

rest on her bed which now she often did for a while befor the
supperhour had gone into the garden to enjoi the pleasant air there
she walk until she weari of it same then enter the old
chapel by a side door and sat herself down to think in the chancel not
far from a lifes statu of the virgin in paint oak which stood
here becaus of it peculiar for the back half of it seem to be
built into the masonri also the eyesocket were empti which suggest
to the observ emlyn either that thei had onc held jewel or that
thi wa no like of the holi mother but rather on of the blind st
luci
while emlyn muse there quit alonefor at thi hour none enter the
place nor would until the next morningsh thought that she
heard strang nois as of some on stir which came from the
neighbourhood of the statu now mani would have been scare and
depart but not so emlyn who onli sat still and listen present
without move her head she look also as it happen the light of
the set sun pour through the west window fell almost full upon
the figur and by it she saw or thought she saw that the eyesocket
were no longer empti there were ey in them which move and flash
now for a moment even emlyn wa frighten then she reason with
herself reflect that a priest or on of the nun wa watch her
from behind the statu which thei might do for as long as thei pleas
or perhap thi wa a miracl such as she had heard so much of but
never seen well why should she fear spi or miracl she would
sit where she wa and see what happen nor had she long to wait for

chapter ix
the blossholm witch
on the afternoon of that dai the abbot came again to visit the nunneri
and sent for cice and emlyn thei found him alon in the guesthal
walk up and down it length with a troubl face
cice foterel he said without ani form of greet when last
we met you refus to sign the deed which i brought with me well it
matter noth for that purchas ha gone back upon hi bargain
sai that he like not the titl suggest cice
ay though who taught you of titl and the in and out of law but
what need to ask and he glower at emlyn well let it pass for
now i have a paper with me that you must sign read it if you will it
is harmlessonli an instruct to the tenant of the land your
father held to pai their rent to me thi michaelma as warden of that
properti
do thei refus then see that you hold it all my lord abbot
ay some on ha been at work among them and the stubborn churl will
not without instruct under your hand and seal the farm your father
work himself i have reap but last night everi grain of corn and
everi fleec of wool were burn in the fire
then i prai you keep account of them my lord that you mai pai me
their valu when we come to settl our score see that i never gave
you leav to shear my sheep and harvest my corn
you ar pleas to be sauci girl he repli bite hi lip i have
no time to bandi wordssign and do you wit emlyn stower
cice took the document glanc at it then slowli tore it into four
piec and threw it to the floor
rob me and my unborn child if you can and will at least ill be no
thief partner she said quietli now if you want my name go forg
it for i sign noth
the abbot face grew veri evil
do you rememb woman he ask that here you ar in my power do
you not know that rebelli sinner such as you ar can be shut in a
dark dungeon and fed on the bread and water of afflict and beaten
with the rod of penanc will you do my bid or shall these thing
fall on you
cice beauti face flush up and for a moment her blue ey
fill with the tear of shame and terror then thei clear again and
she look at him boldli and answer
i know that a murder can be a tortur also why should not he who
butcher the father scourg the daughter too but i know also that
there is a god who protect the innoc though sometim he is slow
to lift hi hand and to him i appeal my lord abbot i know moreov
that i am foterel and carfax and that no man or woman of my blood ha
ever yet yield to fear or pain i sign noth and turn she
left the room
now the abbot and emlyn were alon suddenli befor she could speak
for her tongu wa ti with rage he began to rate and curs her and
to threaten horribl thing against her and her mistress such thing as
onli a cruel spaniard could imagin at length he paus for breath and
she broke in
peac wick man lest the roof fall on you for i am sure that everi
cruel word you speak shall becom a snake to strike you will you not
take warn by what befel you last night or must there be more such
lesson
oho he answer so you know of that do you as i thought your
witchcraft wa at work there
how can i help know what the whole sky blazon the fat monk of
blossholm must draw their girdl tight thi winter those stolen land
bring no luck it seem and john foterel blood ha turn to fire
be warn i sai be warn nai ill hear no more of your foul tongu
lai a finger on that poor ladi if you dare and pai the price and she
too turn and went
er he left the nunneri the abbot had an interview with mother matilda
cice must be disciplin he said gentli at first afterward with
rough even to scourg if need werefor her soul sake also
her servant emlyn must be kept awai from herfor her soul sake sinc
without doubt she wa a danger witch also when the time of the
birth of the child came on he would send a wise woman to wait upon her
on who wa accustom to such casesfor her bodi sake and that of
her child in the midst of the great troubl that had fallen upon them
through the terribl fire at the abbei which had cost them such fear
loss to sai noth of the live of two of the servant and other
burn and maim he had not much time to talk of such small thing
but did she understand
then it wa that mother matilda the meek and gentl brought pain and
astonish to the heart of the lord abbot her spiritu superior
she did not understand in the least such disciplin as he suggest
whatev might be her fault and frailti wa she declar with vigour
entir unsuit to the case of the ladi cice who in her opinion
had suffer much for a small caus and who moreov wa about to
becom a mother and therefor should be treat with everi gentl
for her part she wash her hand of the whole busi and rather
than enforc such command would lai the case befor the vicargener
in london who she understood wa readi to look into such matter
or at least she would set the ladi harflet and her servant outsid the
gate and call upon the charit to assist them of cours howev
if hi lordship chose to send a skill woman to wait upon her in her
troubl she could have no object provid that thi woman were a
person of good reput but in the circumst it wa idl to talk to
her of bread and water and dark cell and scourg such thing
should never happen while she wa prioress befor thei did she and
her sister would walk out of the nunneri and leav the king court to
judg of the matter
now the state of the abbot wa veri like to that of a terrier dog which
be accustom to worri and torment a certain ewesheep come upon
the same after it ha lamb and find a new creatureon that instead
of run in affright turn upon it and with head and hood and all
it weight of mutton butt and leap and trampl then what chanc
ha that dog against the terribl and unsuspect furi of the sheep
born as it thought for it to tear then what can it do but run
pant and discomfit to it kennel so it wa with the abbot at the
onslaught of mother matilda in the defenc of her lambcic with
emlyn he had been prepar to exchang bite for bitebut mother
matilda hi own pet quarri it wa too much he could onli go awai
curs all women and their infinit varieti on which no man might
build who would have thought it of mother matilda of all peopl on the
earth
so it came to pass that at the nunneri notwithstand these terribl
threat thing went on much as thei had done befor sinc the time
were such that even an allpow and remot lord abbot with right
of gallow could not drive matter to an extrem cice wa not
shut into the dungeon and fed on bread and water much less wa she
scourg nor wa she separ from her nurs emlyn although it is
true that the prioress reprov her for her resist to establish
author and when she had finish her lectur kiss and bless
her and call her her sweet child her dove and joi
but if there wa same at the nunneri at the abbei there wa
constant chang and excit onli three dai after the fire the great
flock of eight hundr lamb rush on night over the red cliff on the
fell where as all shepherd in that countri know there is a sheer
drop of forti feet never wa lamb flesh so cheap in blossholm and
the countri round as on the morrow of that night while everi hind
within ten mile could have a winter coat for the skin moreov
it wa said and sworn to by the shepherd that the devil himself with
horn and hoof and mount on a jackass had been seen drive the
same lamb
next the ghost of sir john foterel appear clad in armour sometim
mount and sometim afoot but alwai at nighttim first thi
dread spirit wa perceiv walk in the garden of shefton hall
where it met the abbot caretakerfor the place wa now shut upa he
went to set a spring for hare he wa a man advanc in year yet few
hors ever cover the distanc between shefton and blossholm abbei
more quickli than he did that night
nor would he or ani other return to hi charg so that henceforth
shefton wa left as a dwell for the ghost which as all might see
from time to time shone in the windowplac like a candl moreov
the said ghost travel far and wide for on dark windi night it
knock upon the door of those that in it lifetim had been it
tenant and in a hollow voic declar that it had been murder by
the abbot of blossholm and hi underl who held it daughter in
duranc and under threat of unearthli vengeanc command all men to
bring him to justic and to pai him neither fee nor homag
so much terror did thi ghost caus that thoma boll the swift of
foot wa set to watch for it and return announc that he had seen
it and that it call him by hi name whereon he be a bold fellow
and believ that it wa but a man sent an arrow straight through it
at which it laugh and forthwith vanish awai more in proof of these
thing he led the abbot and hi monk to the veri place and show them
where he had stood and where the ghost stoody and the arrow of
which all the feather had been mysteri burnt off and the wood
sear as though by fire sunk deep into a tree beyond then as
thi thing had becom a scandal and a dread the abbot in hi robe
solemnli laid the ghost thoma boll show him exactli where it had
pass
thi spirit be well and truli laid like a foundationston the
abbot and hi monk return homeward through the wood but as thei went
a dread voic which all recogn as that of sir john foterel
call these word from the shadow of an impenetr thicketfor now
the night wa fall
clement maldonado abbot of blossholm i whom thou didst murder
summon thee to meet me within a year befor the throne of god
thereon all fled ye even the abbot fled or rather as he said hi
hors did thoma boll who had lag behind outrun them everi
on and get home the first sai av as he went
after thi although the whole countrysid hunt for it sir john
ghost wa seen no more doubtless it work wa done but the abbot
explain matter differ other and wors thing were seen
howev
on moonlight night a disturb wa heard among the cow that
bellow and rush about the field into which thei had been turn
after milk think that dog had got amongst them the herd and
a watchmanfor now no man would stir alon after sunset at
blossholmew to see what wa happen and present fell down half
dead with fright for there lean over the gate and laugh at them
wa the foul fiend himselfth fiend with horn and tail and in hi
hand an instrument like a pitchfork
how the pair got home again thei never knew but thi is certain that
after that night no on could milk those cow moreov some of them
slip their calv and becam so wild that thei must be slaughter
next came rumour that even the nunneri itself wa haunt especi
the chapel here voic were heard talk and emlyn stower who wa
prai there came out vow that she had seen a ball of fire which
roll up and down the aisl and in the centr of it a man head that
seem to try to talk to her but could not
into thi matter inquiri wa held by the abbot himself who ask emlyn
if she knew the face that wa in the ball of fire she answer that she
thought so it seem veri like to on of hi own guard name andrew
wood or more commonli drunken andrew a scotchman whom sir christoph
harflet wa said to have kill on the night of the great burn at
least hi lordship would rememb that thi andrew had a broken nose
and so had the head in the fire but as it appear to have chang a
great deal sinc death she could not be quit certain all she wa sure
of wa that it seem to be try to give her some messag
now recal the trick that had been plai with the said andrew
bodi the abbot wa silent onli he ask shrewdli if emlyn had seen so
terribl a thing there how it came about that she wa not afraid to
be alon in the chapel which he wa inform she frequent much she
answer with a laugh that it wa men she dread not spirit good
or ill
no he exclaim with a burst of rage you do not dread them woman
becaus you ar a witch and summon them nor shall we be free from
these wizardri until the fire ha you and your compani
if so repli emlyn coolli i will ask dead andrew for hi messag
to you next time we meet unless he choos to deliv it to you
himself
so thei part but that veri night there happen the worst thing of
all it wa about on in the morn when the abbot whose window wa
set open wa waken by a voic that spoke with a scotch accent and
repeatedli call him by hi name summon him to look out and see
he and other rose and look but could see noth for the night wa
veri dark and rain fell when the dawn came howev their search
wa reward for there set upon a pinnacl of the abbei church and
stare straight into the window of hi lordship sleepingroom from
which it wa but a few yard distant wa the dread head of andrew
wood
furious the abbot ask who had done thi horribl thing but the
monk who were sure that it wa the same be that had bewitch the
cow onli shrug their shoulder and suggest that the grave of
andrew should be open to see if he had lost hi head thi wa done at
length although for hi own reason the abbot forbad it talk of
the violat of the dead
well the grave wa open when maldon wa awai on on of hi mysteri
journei and lo no andrew wa there but onli a beam of oakwood
stuf out with straw to the shape of a man and sewn up in a blanket
for the real andrew or rather what wa left of him lai it mai be
rememb in anoth grave that wa suppos to be fill by sir
christoph harflet
from thi dai forward the whole countrysid for fifti mile round rang
with the tale of what were known as the blossholm witch of which
a proof wa still to be seen by all men in the wither head of andrew
perch upon it pinnacl whenc none could be found to remov it
for love or monei onli it wa note that the abbot chang hi
sleepingchamb after which except for a sick which struck the
monksit wa thought from the drink of sour beerthes bedevil
were abat
inde at that time men had other thing to think of sinc the air wa
thick with rumour of impend chang the king threaten the church
and the church prepar to resist the king there wa talk of the
suppress of the monasteriessom in fact had alreadi been
suppressedand more talk of a rise of the faith in the shire of
york and lincoln high matter which call abbot maldon much awai from
home
on dai he return weari but satisfi from a long journei and
amongst the new that await him found a messag from the prioress
over which he ponder while he at hi food also there wa a letter
from spain which he studi eagerli
some nine month had pass sinc the ship great yarmouth sail and
dure thi time all that had been heard of her wa that she had never
reach sevil so that like everi on els the abbot believ she
had founder in the deep sea thi wa a sad event which he had
born with resign see that although it meant the loss of hi
letter which were of import she had aboard of her sever person
whom he wish to see no more especi sir christoph harflet and
sir john foterel servingman jeffrei stoke who wa said to
carri with him certain inconveni document even hi secretari
and chaplain brother martin could be spare be maldon felt a
charact better suit to heaven than to an earth where the best of men
must be prepar sometim to compromis with conscienc
in short the vanish of the great yarmouth wa the wise decre of
a farse provid that had remov certain stumblingblock
from hi feet which of late had been forc to travel over a rough and
thorni road for the dead tell no tale although it wa true that the
ghost of sir john foterel and the grin head of drunken andrew
on hi pinnacl seem to be instanc to the contrari christoph
harflet and jeffrei stoke at the bottom of the bai of biscai could
bring no awkward charg and left him none to deal with save an
imprison and forgotten girl and an unborn child
now thing were chang again howev for the spanish letter in hi
hand told him that the great yarmouth had not sunk sinc two member
of her crew who escapedhow it wa not saiddeclar that she had
been captur by turkish or other infidel pirat and taken awai through
the strait of gibraltar to some place unknown therefor if he had
surviv the voyag christoph harflet might still be live and so
might jeffrei stoke and brother martin yet thi wa not like
for probabl thei would have perish in the fight be hothead
englishmen all three of them or at the best have been commit to the
turkish gallei whenc not on man in a thousand ever return
on the whole then he had littl caus to fear them who were dead
or as good as dead especi in the midst of so mani more press
danger all he had to fear all that stood between him or rather the
church and a veri rich inherit wa the girl in the nunneri and an
unborn child andy emlyn stower well he wa sure that the child
would not live and probabl the mother would not live as for emlyn as
she deserv she would be burn for a witch er long too now that
he had time to see to it and if she surviv her sick although he
griev for her cice her accomplic should justli accompani her to
the stake meanwhil as mother matilda messag told him thi matter
of the child wa urgent
the abbot call a monk who wa wait on him and bade him send word
to a woman known as goodi megg bid her come at onc within ten
minut she enter have as she explain been warn to be close
at hand
thi goodi megg who had some local reput as a wise woman wa a
person of about fifti year of ag remark for her enorm size a
flat face with small oblong ey and a littl twist mouth which had
caus her to be nicknam the flounder she greet the abbot with
much rever curtsei till he thought she would fall backward and
have receiv hi fatherli bless sank into a chair that seem to
vanish beneath her bulk
you will wonder why i summon you here friend sinc thi is no place

oh no my lord answer the woman iv heard it is to wait upon
sir christoph harflet wife in her troubl
i wish that i could call her by the honour name of wife said the
abbot with a sigh but a mockmarriag doe not make a wife mistress
megg and ala the poor babe if ever it should be born will be but
a bastard mark from it birth with the brand of shame
now the flounder who wa no fool began to take her cue
it is sad veri sad your holinessno that wrong but never mind
it will be right befor all done and a good omen i sai come so
sudden and chancyyour lordship i meannot but what there lot
of the sort about here as is gener the case round ai mean

and she paus

happen and of cours you were not to blame now good mistress megg
will you undertak thi case which cannot be left to ignor nun
though time ar hard here sinc of late mani loss have fallen on our

the woman shuffl her big feet and stare at the floor then look up
suddenli with a glanc that seem to bore to hi heart like a bradawl
and ask
and if perchanc the bless babe should fly to heaven through my
finger as in my time i have known dozen of them do should i still
get that pai
then the abbot answer with a smilea somewhat sickli smilethen
i think mistress you should have doubl pai to consol you for your
sorrow and for ani doubt that might be thrown upon your skill
now that nobl trade she repli with an evil leer such as
on might hope for from an abbot but my lord thei sai the nunneri is

mouth shut and to look the other wai and through vile scandal and evil
slander such as the smith girl my busi isnt what it wa now
if i could have it without rent for the first two year till i had time

begon said the abbot in such a voic that she scrambl to her feet
and went unbless and unabsolv
when the door had close behind her he went to the window and flung it
wide although the night wa foul
by all the saint he mutter that beastli murderess poison the

chapter x
mother megg and the ghost
flounder megg with all the paraphernalia of her trade wa
establish as nurs to cice at the nunneri thi establish it is
true had not been easi sinc emlyn who knew someth of the woman
reput and suspect more resist it with all her strength but here
the prioress interven in her gentl wai she herself she explain
did not like thi person who look so odd drank so much beer and
talk so fast yet she had made inquiri and found that she wa
extraordinarili skill in matter of that natur inde it wa said
that she had succeed in case that were wonderfulli difficult which
the leech had abandon as hopeless though of cours there had been
other case where she had not succeed but these she wa inform
were gener those of poor peopl who did not pai her well now in
thi instanc her pai would be ampl for she mother matilda had
promis her a splendid fee out of her privat store and for the rest
sinc no man doctor might enter there who els wa compet not she
or the other nun for none of them had been marri save old bridget
who wa silli and had long ago forgotten all such thing not emlyn
even who wa but a girl when her own child wa born and sinc then had
been otherwis emploi therefor there wa no choic
to thi reason emlyn agre perforc though she mistrust her of
the fat wretch whose appear poor cice also dislik still for
veri fear emlyn wa humbl and civil to her for if she were not
who could know if she would put out all her skill upon behalf of her
mistress therefor she did her bid like a slave and spice her
beer and made her bed and even listen to her foul jest and talk
unmurmuringli
the busi wa over at length and the child a nobl boi born into
the world had not the flounder produc it in triumph laid upon a
littl basket cover with a lambskin and had not emlyn and mother
matilda and all the nun kiss and bless it had it not also for
fear of accid such wa the fatherli forethought of the abbot been
baptiz at onc by a priest who wa wait under the name of john
christoph foterel john after it grandfath and christoph after
it father with foterel for a surnam sinc the abbot would not allow
that it should be call harflet be as he aver baseborn
so thi child wa born and mother megg swore that of all the two
hundr and three that she had issu into the world it wa the finest
nine and a half pound in weight at the veri least also as it voic
and movement testifi it wa lusti and like to live for did not the
flounder in sight of all the wonder nun hold it up hang by it
hand to her two fat forefing and afterward drink a whole quart of
spice al to it health and long life
but if the babe wa like to live cice wa like to die inde she
wa veri veri ill and perhap would have pass awai had it not been
for a devic of emlyn for when she wa at her worst and the flounder
shake her head and sai that she could do no more had depart to
her etern al and a nap emlyn crept up and took her mistresss cold
hand
darl she said hear me but cice did not stir darl she
repeat hear me i have new for you of your husband
cice white face turn a littl on the pillow and her blue ey
open
of my husband she whisper why he is gone as i soon shall be
what new of him
that he is not gone that he live or so i believ though heretofor
i have hid it from you
the head wa lift for a moment and the ey stare at her with
wonder joi
do you trick me nurs nai you would never do that give me the milk
i want it now ill listen i promis you ill not die till you have
told me if christoph live why should i die who onli hope to find
him
so emlyn whisper all she knew it wa not much onli that christoph
had not been buri in the grave where he wa said to be buri and
that he had been taken wound aboard the ship great yarmouth of the
fate of which ship fortun she had heard noth still slight as
thei might be to cice these tide were a magic medicin for did
thei not mean the rebirth of hope hope that for nine long month had
been dead and buri with christoph from that moment she began to
mend
when the flounder have slept off her drink return to the sickb
she stare at her amaz and mutter someth about witchcraft she
who had been sure that she would die as in those dai so mani women did
who fell into hand like her inde she wa bitterli disappoint
know that thi death wa desir by her employ who now after all
might let the ford inn to anoth moreov the child wa no waster
but on who wa set for life well that at least she could mend and if
it were done quickli the shock might kill the mother yet the thing
wa not so easi as it look for there were mani love ey upon that
babe
when she wish to take it to her bed at night emlyn forbad her
fierc and on be appeal to the prioress who knew the
creatur drunken habit and had heard rumour of the fate of the smith
infant and other gave order that it wa not to be so sinc the
mother wa too weak to have it with her the boi wa laid in a littl
cot at her side and alwai dai and night on or more of the sweetfac
nun stood at the head of that cot watch as might a guardian angel
also it took onli natur food sinc from the first cice would nurs
it so that she could not mix ani drug with it milk that would caus it
to sleep itself awai
so the dai went on bring black wrath despair almost to the heart
of mother megg till at length there came the chanc she sought on
fine even when the nun were gather at vesper but as it happen
not in the chapel becaus sinc the tale of the haunt thei shun
the place after high noon cice whose strength wa return to her
ask emlyn to chang her garment and remak her bed meanwhil the
babe wa given to sister bridget who dote on it with instruct to
take it to walk in the garden for a time sinc the rain had pass off
and the afternoon wa now veri soft and pleasant so she went and there
present wa met by the flounder who wa suppos to be asleep but
had follow her a person of whom the halfwit bridget wa much
afraid
what ar you do with my babe old fool she screech at her
thrust her fat face to within an inch of the nun youll let it
fall and i shall be blame give me the angel or i will twist your nose
for you give it me i sai and get you gone
in her fear and flurri old bridget obei and depart at a run then
recov herself a littl or drawn by some instinct she return
hid herself in a clump of lilac bush and watch
present she saw the flounder after glanc about to make sure that
she wa alon enter the chapel carri the child and heard her
bolt the door after her now bridget as she said afterward grew veri
frighten she knew not why and act on impuls ran to the chancel
window and climb on to a wheelbarrow that stood there look

to sai her prayer till she perceiv for a rai from the set sun
show it all that on the pave befor her lai the infant and that
thi shedevil wa thrust her thick forefing down it throat for
alreadi it grew black in the face and as she thrust mutter savag
so horrorstruck wa bridget that she could neither move nor cry
then while she stood petrifi suddenli there appear the figur of
a man in rusti armour the flounder look up saw him and withdraw
her finger from the mouth of the child let out yell after yell the
man who said noth drew a sword and lift it whereon the murderess
scream

cri march with it down the aisl the next thing of which bridget

bridget took the child and sank down on to the ground and at that
moment the nun alarm by the aw yell rush through the side

ever she had been noth more had been heard of the abbot and though
all knew that danger threaten them from thi quarter thei were content
to enjoi the present hour of peac and wait till it wa at hand
but in cice awaken mind there aros a keen desir to learn more
of what her nurs had hint to her when she lai upon the veri edg of
death dai by dai she pli emlyn with question till at length she
knew all name that the tide came from thoma boll and that he
dress in her father armour wa the ghost who had save her boi from
death now noth would serv her but that she must see thoma herself
as she said to thank him though truli as emlyn knew well to draw
from hi own lip everi detail and circumst that she could gather
concern christoph
for a while emlyn held out against her for she knew the danger of such
a meet but in the end be abl to refus her ladi noth she
gave wai
at length at the appoint hour of sunset emlyn and cice stood in
the chapel whither the latter told the nun she wish to go to return
thank for her deliver from mani danger thei knelt befor the
altar and while thei made pretenc to prai there heard knock which
were the signal of the presenc of thoma boll emlyn answer them
with other knock which told that all wa safe whereon the wooden
imag turn and thoma appear dress as befor in sir john
foterel armour so like did he seem to her dead father in thi
familiar mail that for a moment cice thought it must be he and her

husband whom i thought slain and buri in truth wa onli wound and
not buri but ship oversea tell me that stori friend omit
noth but swiftli for our time is short i thirst to hear it from
your own lip
so in hi slow wander wai he told her word by word all that he
had seen all that he had learn and the sum of it wa that sir
christoph had been ship abroad upon the great yarmouth sore
wound but not dead and that with him had sail jeffrei stoke and
the monk martin
that ten month gone said cice ha naught been heard of thi
ship by now she should be home again
thoma hesit then answer
no tide came of her from spain then although i said noth of it
even to emlyn she wa report lost with all hand at sea then came
anoth stori
ah that other stori
ladi two of her crew reach the wash i did not see them and thei
have ship again for marseil in franc but i spoke with a shepherd
who is halfbroth to on of them and he told me that from him he
learn that the great yarmouth wa set upon by two turkish pirat
and captur after a brave fight in which the captain goodi and other
were kill thi man and hi comrad escap in a boat and drift
to and fro till thei were pick up by a homewardbound caravel which
land them at hull that all i knowsav on thing
on thing oh what thing thoma that my husband is dead
nai nai the veri opposit that he is aliv or wa for these men
saw him and jeffrei stoke and martin the priest no craven as i know
fight like devil till the turk overwhelm them by number and
have bound their hand carri them all three unwound on board on
of their ship wish doubtless to make slave of such brave fellow
now although emlyn would have stop her still cice pli him with
question which he answer as best he could till suddenli a sound
caught hi ear
look at the window he exclaim
thei look and saw a sight that froze their blood for there stare
at them through the glass wa the dark face of the abbot and with it
other face
betrai me not or i shall burn he whisper sai onli that i came
to haunt you and silent as a shadow he glide to hi nich and wa
gone
what now emlyn
on thing onlythoma must be save a bold face and stand to it is
it our fault if your father ghost should haunt thi chapel rememb
your father ghost no other ah here thei come
as she spoke the door wa thrown wide and through it came the abbot
and hi rout of attend within two pace of the women thei halt
hang togeth like bee for thei were afraid while a voic cri
seiz the witch
cice terror pass from her and she face them boldli
what would you with us my lord abbot she ask
we would know sorceress what shape wa that which spoke with you but
now and whither ha it gone
the same that save my child and call the sword of god down upon the
murderess it wore my father armour but it face i did not see it
ha gone whenc it came but where that is i know not discov if you
can
woman you trifl with us what said the thing
it spoke of the slaughter of sir john foterel by king grave mount
and of those who wrought it and she look at him steadili until hi
ey fell befor her
what els
it told me that my husband is not dead neither did you buri him as you
put about but ship him henc to spain whenc it prophesi he will
return again to be reveng upon you it told me that he wa captur by
the infidel moor and with him jeffrei stoke my father servant and
the priest martin your secretari then it look up and vanish or
seem to vanish though perhap it is among us now
ay answer the abbot satan with whom you hold convers is
alwai among us cice foterel and emlyn stower you ar foul witch
selfconfess the world ha born your sorceri too long and you
shall answer for them befor god and man as i the lord abbot of
blossholm have right and author to make you do seiz these witch
and let them be kept fast in their chamber till i constitut the court
ecclesiast for their trial
so thei took hold of cice and emlyn and led them to the nunneri as
thei cross the garden thei were met by mother matilda and the nun
who for a second time within a month ran out to see what wa the
tumult in the chapel
what is it now cice ask the prioress
now we ar witch mother she answer with a sad smile
ay broke in emlyn and the charg is that the ghost of the murder
sir john foterel wa seen speak to us
why why exclaim the prioress if the spirit of a woman father
appear to her is she therefor to be declar a witch then is poor
sister bridget a witch also for thi same spirit brought the child to
her
ay said the abbot i had forgotten her she is anoth of the crew
let her be seiz and shut up also greatli do i hope when it come to
the hour of trial that there mai not be found to be more of them and
he glanc at the poor nun with menac in hi ey
so cice and emlyn were shut within their room and strictli guard
by monk but otherwis not illtreat inde save for their
confin there wa littl chang in their condit the child wa
allow to be with cice the nun were allow to visit her
onli over both of them hung the shadow of great troubl thei were
awar and it seem to them purpos suffer to be awar that
thei were about to be tri for their live upon monstrou and obscen
charg name that thei had consort with a dim and aw creatur
call the enemi of mankind whom it wa suppos human be had
power to call to their counsel and assist to them who knew well
that thi be wa thoma boll the thing seem absurd yet it could
not be deni that the said thoma at emlyn instig had work
much evil on the monk of blossholm pai them or rather their
abbot back in hi own coin
yet what wa to be done to tell the fact would be to condemn thoma
to some fear fate which even then thei would be call upon to share
although possibl thei might be clear of the charg of witchcraft
emlyn set the matter befor cice urg neither on side nor the
other and wait her judgment it wa swift and decis
thi is a coil that we cannot untangl said cice let us betrai
no on but put our trust in god i am sure she ad that god will
help us as he did when mother megg would have murder my boi i shall
not attempt to defend myself by wrong other i leav everyth to
him
strang thing have happen to mani who trust in god to that the
whole evil world bear wit said emlyn doubtfulli
mai be answer cice in her quiet fashion perhap becaus thei
did not trust enough or rightli at least there li my path and i will
walk in itto the fire if need be
there is some seed of great in you to what will it grow i
wonder repli emlyn with a shrug of her shoulder
on the morrow thi faith of cice wa put to a sharp test the abbot
came and spoke with emlyn apart thi wa the burden of hi song
give me those jewel and all mai yet be well with you and your
mistress vile witch though you ar if not you burn
as befor she deni all knowledg of them
find me the jewel or you burn he answer would you pai your live
for a few miser gem
now emlyn weaken not for her own sake and said she would speak with

chapter xi
doom
it wa the dai of trial from dawn cice and emlyn had seen peopl
hurri in and out of the gate of the nunneri and heard workmen
make prepar in the guesthal below their chamber about eight
on of the nun brought them their breakfast her face wa scare and
white she onli spoke in whisper look behind her continu as
though she knew she wa be watch
emlyn ask who their judg were and she answer
the abbot a strang blackfac prior and the old bishop oh god
help you my sister god help us all and she fled awai
now for a moment emlyn heart fail her sinc befor such a tribun
what chanc had thei the abbot wa their bitter enemi and accus
the strang prior no doubt on of hi friend and kindr while the
ecclesiast spoken of as the old bishop wa well known as perhap the
cruelest man in england a scourg of hereticsthat is befor
heresi becam the fashiona hunterout of witch and wizard and a
timeserv to boot but to cice she said noth for what wa the
us see that soon she would learn all
thei at their food know both of them that thei would need strength
then cice nurs her child and place it in emlyn arm knelt
down to prai while she wa still prai the door open and a
process appear first came two monk then six arm men of the
abbot guard then the prioress and three of her nun at the sight of
the beauti young woman kneel at her prayer the guard rough men
though thei were stop as if unwil to disturb her but on of
the monk cri brutal
seiz the accurs hypocrit and if she will not come drag her with
you at the same time stretch out hi hand as though to grasp her
arm
but cice rose and face him sai
do not touch me i follow emlyn give me the child and let us go
so thei went in the midst of the arm men the monk preced the
nun with bow head follow after present thei enter the
larg hall but on it threshold were order to paus while wai wa
made for them cice never forgot the sight of it as it appear that
dai the lofti arch roof of rich chestnutwood set there hundr of
year befor by hand that spare neither work nor timber amongst the
beam of which the bright light of morn plai so clearli that she
could see the spider web and in on of them a sleepi autumn
wasp caught fast the mob of peopl gather to watch her public
trialfac mani of them that she had known from childhood
how thei stare at her as she stood there by the head of the step her
sleep child held in her arm thei were a pack audienc and had
been prepar to condemn herthat she could see and hear for did not
some of them point and frown and set up a cry of witch as thei had
been told to do but it di awai the sight of her the daughter of on
of their great men and the widow of anoth stand in her innoc
beauti the slumber babe upon her breast seem to quell them till
the hardest face grew pitifulful of resent too some of them
but not against her
then the three judg on the bench behind the tabl at which sat the
monkish secretari the hardfac hooknos old bishop in hi
gorgeou robe and mitr hi crozier rest against the panel
behind him peer about him with beadi ey the sullen heavyjaw
prior from some distant counti on hi left clad in a simpl black
gown with a girdl about hi waist and on the right clement maldon
abbot of blossholm and enemi of her hous suav olivefac
foreignlook hi black uneasi ey observ all hi keen ear
catch everi word and murmur as he whisper someth to the bishop
that caus him to smile grimli lastli place alreadi in the rope
space and guard by a soldier poor old bridget the halfwit who
wa gabbl word to which no on paid ani heed
the path wa clear now and thei were order to walk on halfwai
up the hall someth red attract cice attent and glanc
round she saw that it wa the beard of thoma boll their ey met
and hi were full of fear in an instant she understood that he dread
lest he should be betrai and given over to some aw doom
fear noth she whisper as she pass and he heard her or
perhap emlyn glanc told him that he wa safe at least a sign of
relief broke from him
now thei had enter the rope space and stood there
your name ask on of the secretari point to cice with the
feather of hi quill
all know it it is cice harflet she answer gentli whereon the
clerk said roughli that she li and the old wrangl began again as to
the valid of her marriag the abbot maintain that she wa still
cice foterel the mother of a baseborn child
into thi argument the bishop enter with some zest ask mani
question and seem more or less to take her side sinc where
matter of religion were not concern he wa a keen lawyer and just
enough at length howev he swept the thing awai remark brutal
that if half he had heard were true soon the name by which she had last
been call in life would not concern her and bade the clerk write her
down as cice harflet or foterel
then emlyn gave her name and sister bridget wa written without
question next the charg against them wa read it wa long and
technic mix up with latin word and phrase and all that cice
made out of it wa that thei were accus of mani horribl crime and
of have call up the devil and consort with him in the shape of
a monster with horn and hoof and of her father ghost when it
wa finish thei were command to answer and plead not guilti or
rather cice and emlyn did for bridget broke into a long tale that
could not be follow she wa order to be silent after which no on
took ani more heed of what she said
now the bishop ask whether these women had been put to the question
and when he wa told no said that it seem a piti as evid thei
were stubborn witch and some disciplin of the sort might have
save troubl again he ask if the witch mark had been found on
themthat is the spot where the devil had seal their bodi
on which as wa well known hi chosen could feel no pain he even
suggest that the trial should be adjourn until thei had been prick
all over with a nail to find thi spot but ultim gave up the point
to save time
a last question wa rais by the beetlebrow prior who submit
that the infant ought also to be accus sinc he too wa said to
have consort with the devil have accord to the stori been
rescu from death by him and afterward been carri in hi arm and
given to the nun bridget which wa the onli evid against the said
bridget if she wa guilti why then wa the infant innoc ought
not thei to burn togeth sinc a babe that had been nurs by the evil
on wa obvious damn
the legalmind bishop found thi argument interest but ultim
decid that it wa safer to overrul it on account of the tender ag of
the crimin he ad that it did not matter sinc doubtless the foul
fiend would claim hi own er long
lastli befor the wit were call emlyn ask for an advoc to
defend them but the bishop repli with a chuckl that it wa quit
unnecessari sinc alreadi thei had the best of all advocatessatan
himself
true my lord said cice look up we have the best of all
advoc onli you have misnam him the god of the innoc is our
advoc and in him i trust
blasphem not sorceress shout the old man and the evid
commenc
to follow it in detail is not necessari and inde would be long for
it took mani hour first of all emlyn earli life wa set out much
be made of the fact that her mother wa a gypsi who had commit
suicid and that her father had fallen under the ban of the inquisit
an heret work of hi have been publicli burn then the abbot
himself gave evid sinc where the charg wa sorceri no on
seem to think it strang that the same man should both act as judg
and be the princip wit for the prosecut he told of cice
wild word after the burn of cranwel tower from which burn she
and her familiar emlyn had evid escap by magic without the
aid of which it wa plain thei could not have live he told of emlyn
threat to him after she had look into the bowl of water of all the
dread thing that had been seen and done at blossholm which no
doubt these witch had brought abouther he wa rightthough how
he knew not he told of the death of the midwif and of the appear
which she present afterwardsa tale that caus hi audienc to
shudder and lastli he told of the vision of the ghost of sir john
foterel hold convers with the two accus in the chapel of the
nunneri and it vanish awai
when at length he had finish emlyn ask leav to crossexamin him
but thi wa refus on the ground that person accus of such crime
had no right to crossexamin
then the court adjourn for a while to eat some food be brought for
the prison who were forc to take it where thei stood wors
still cice wa driven to nurs her child in the presenc of all that
audienc who stare and gibe at her rude and were angri becaus
emlyn and some of the nun stood round her to form a live screen
when the judg return the evid went on though most of it wa
entir irrelev it volum wa so great that at length the old
bishop grew weari and said he would hear no more then the judg
went on to put first to cice and afterward to emlyn a seri of
question of a natur so abomin that after deni the first of them
indignantli thei stood silent refus to answerproof posit of
their guilt as the blackbrow prior remark in triumph lastli
these hideou queri be exhaust cice wa ask if she had
anyth to sai
somewhat she answer but i am weari and must be brief i am no
witch i do not know what it mean the abbot of blossholm who sit
as my judg is my grievou enemi he claim my father landswhich
land i believ he now holdsand cruelli murder my said father by
king grave mount in the forest as he wa ride to london to make
complaint of him and reveal hi treacheri to hi grace the king and hi
council
it is a lie witch broke in the abbot but take no heed cice
went on
afterward he and hi hire soldier attack the hous of my husband
sir christoph harflet and burnt it slai or strive to
slayi know not whichmi said husband who ha vanish awai then he
imprison me and my servant emlyn stower in thi nunneri and strove
to forc me to sign paper convei all my own and my child properti
to him thi i refus to do and therefor it is that he put me on my
trial becaus as i am told those who ar found guilti of witchcraft
ar strip of all their possess which those take who ar strong
enough to keep them lastli i deni the author of thi court and
appeal to the king who soon or late will hear my cry and aveng my
wrong and mayb my murder upon those who wrought them good peopl
all hear my word i appeal to the king and to him under god abov i
entrust my caus and should i die the guardianship of my orphan son
whom the abbot sent hi creatur to murderhi vile creatur upon
whose head fell the almighti justic as it will fall on your you
slaughter of the innoc
so spoke cice and have spoken worn out with fatigu and miseri
sank to the floorfor all these hour there had been no stool for her
to sit onand crouch there still hold her child in her armsa
piteou sight inde which touch even the superstiti heart of the
crowd who watch her
now thi appeal of her to the king seem to scare the fierc old
bishop who turn and began to argu with the abbot cice listen
caught some of hi word such as
on your head be it then i judg onli of the caus ecclesiast and
shall direct it to be so enter upon the record of the execut of
the sentenc or the dispos of the properti i wash my hand see you to
it
so spoke pilat broke in cice lift her head and look him in
the ey then she let it fall again and wa silent
now emlyn open her lip and from them burst a fierc torrent of
word
do you know she began who and what is thi spanish priest who sit
to judg us of witchcraft well i will tell you year ago he fled from
spain becaus of hideou crime that he had commit there ask him of
isabella the nun who wa my father cousin and her end and that of
her companion ask him of
at thi point a monk to whom the abbot had whisper someth slip
behind emlyn and threw a cloth over her face she tore it awai with her
strong hand and scream out
he is a murder he is a traitor he plot to kill the king i can
prove it and that why foterel diedbecaus he knew
the abbot shout someth and again the monk a stout fellow name
ambros got the cloth over her mouth onc more she wrench herself
loos and turn toward the peopl call
have i never a friend who have befriend so mani is there no man in
blossholm who will aveng me of thi brute ambros ay i see some
then thi ambros and other aid him fell upon her strike her
on the head and choke her till at length she sank half stun and
gasp to the ground
now after a hurri word or two with hi colleagu the bishop
sprang up and as dark gather in the hallfor the sun had
setpronounc the sentenc of the court
first he declar the prison guilti of the foulest witchcraft next
he excommun them with much ceremoni deliv their soul to
their master satan then incident he condemn their bodi to
be burnt without specifi when how or by whom out of the gloom a
clear voic spoke sai
you exce your power priest and usurp those of the king bewar
a tumult follow in which some cri ay and some nai and when at
length it di down the bishop or it mai have been the abbotfor none
could see who spokeexclaim
the church guard her own right let the king see to hi
he will he will answer the same voic the pope is in hi bag
monk your dai is done
again there wa tumult a veri great tumult in truth the scene or
rather the sound were strang the bishop shriek with rage upon
the bench like a hen that ha been caught upon her perch at night
the blackbrow prior bellow like a bull the populac surg and
shout thi and that the secretari call for candl and when
at length on wa brought make a littl star of light in that huge
gloom put hi hand to hi mouth and roar
what of thi bridget doe she go free
the bishop made no answer it seem as though he were frighten at the
forc which he had let loos but the abbot halloo back
burn the hag with the other and the secretari wrote it down upon hi
brief
then the guard seiz the three of them to lead them awai and the
frighten babe set up a thin pierc wail while the bishop and hi
companion preced by on of the monk bear the candleit wa that
ambros who had choke emlynmarch in process down the hall to
gain the great door
er ever thei reach it the candl wa dash from the hand of ambros
and a fear tumult aros in the dens dark for now all light
had vanish there were scream and sound of fight and cri for
help these di awai the hall empti by degre for it seem that
none wish to stai there torch were lit and show a strang scene
the bishop the abbot and the foreign prior lai here and there
buffet bleed their robe torn off them so that thei were almost
nake while by the bishop wa hi crozier broken in two appar
across hi own head wors of all the monk ambros lean against a
pillar hi feet seem to go forward but hi face look backward for
hi neck wa twist like that of a michaelma goos
the bishop look about him and felt hi hurt then he call to hi
peopl
bring me my cloak and a hors for i have had enough of blossholm and
it wizardri settl your own matter henceforth abbot maldon for in
them i find no luck and he glanc at hi broken staff
thu end the great trial of the blossholm witch
cice had sunk to sleep at last and emlyn watch her for sinc
there wa nowher els to put them thei were back in their own room
but guard by arm men lest thei should escap of thi as emlyn
knew well there wa littl chanc for even if thei were onc outsid
the priori wall how could thei get awai without friend to help or
food to eat or hors to carri them thei would be run down within a
mile moreov there wa the child which cice would never leav
and after all she had undergon she herself wa not fit to travel
therefor it wa that emlyn sat sleepless full of bitter wrath and
fear for she could see no hope all wa black as the night about them
the door open and wa shut and lock again then from behind the
curtain appear the tall figur of the prioress carri a candl
that made a star of light upon the shadow as she stood there hold
it up and look about her someth came into emlyn mind perhap
she would help she who love cice did she not look like a figur of
hope with her sweet face and her taper in the gloom emlyn advanc to
meet her her finger on her lip
she sleep wake her not she said have you come to tell us that we
burn tomorrow
nai emlyn the old bishop ha command that it shall not be for a
week he would have time to get across england first inde had it not
been for the beat of him in the dark and the twist of the neck of
brother ambros i believ that he would not have suffer it at all
for fear of troubl afterward but now he is full of rage and swear
that he wa set upon by evil spirit in the hall and that those who
loos them shall not live emlyn who kill father ambros wa it
men or
men i think mother the devil doe not twist neck except in monkish
dream is it wonder that my ladyth greatest ladi of all these
part and the most foulli treatedshould have friend left to her why
if thei were not cur er now her peopl would have pull that abbei
stone from stone and cut the throat of everi man within it wall
emlyn said the prioress again in the name of jesu and on your
soul tell me true is there witchcraft in all thi busi and if
not what is it mean
as much witchcraft as dwell in your gentl heart no more a man did
these thing ill not give you hi name lest it should be wrung from
you a man wore foterel armour and came here by a secret hole to
take counsel with us in the chapel a man burnt the abbei dormer and
the stack and harri the beast with a goatskin on hi head and
drag the skull of drunken andrew from hi grave doubtless it wa hi
hand also that twist ambros neck becaus he struck me
the two women look each other in the ey
ah said the prioress i think i can guess now but emlyn you
choos rough tool well fear not your secret is safe with me she
paus a moment then went on oh i am glad who fear lest the
fiend finger wa in it all as in truth thei believ now i see my
path clear and will follow it to the death ye ye i will save you

the old nun drew herself up and answer

that proud priest servant would have forbidden me to enter your
chamber in my own hous but i read them a lesson thei will not forget

emlyn thought for a moment then drew a ring off her finger in which wa
set a cornelian heart
give him thi she said and sai that the wearer bade him follow the
bearer to the death for the sake of that wearer life and anoth
he is a simpl soul and if the abbot doe not catch him first i believ
that he will go
mother matilda took the ring and set it on her own finger then she
walk to where cice lai sleep look at her and the boi upon her
breast stretch out her thin hand she call down the bless and
protect of almighti god upon them both then turn to depart
emlyn caught her by the robe

so the prioress bless her er she glide thenc in her state
fashion and the oaken door open and shut behind her
three dai later the abbot visit them alon
foul and accurs witch he said i come to tell you that next
mondai at noon you burn upon the green in front of the abbei gate who

chapter xii
the stake
it wa an aw night let those who have follow thi histori think of
the state of these two women on of them still but a girl who on the
morrow amidst the jeer and curs of superstiti men were to suffer
the cruelest of death for no crime at all unless the traffick of
emlyn with thoma boll in which cice had small share could be held
a crime well thousand quit as blameless were call on to undergo
that and even wors fate in the dai which some name good and old
the dai of chivalri and gallant knight when even littl children were
torment and burn by holi and learn folk who fear a visibl or at
least a tangibl devil and hi work
doubtless their cruelti wa that of terror doubtless although he
had other end to gain which to him were sacr the abbot maldon did
believ that cice and emlyn had practis horribl witchcraft that
thei had convers with satan in order to reveng themselv upon him
and therefor were too foul to live the old bishop believ it also
and so did the blackbrow prior and the most of the ignor peopl
who live around and knew of the terribl thing which had happen in
blossholm had not some of them actual seen the fiend with horn
and hoof and tail drive the abbei cattl and had not other met
the ghost of sir john foterel which doubtless wa but that fiend in
anoth shape oh these women were guilti without doubt thei were
guilti and deserv the stake what did it matter if the husband and
father of on of them had been murder and the other had suffer
grievou but forgotten wrong compar to witchcraft murder wa but a
light and home crime on that would happen when men passion and
need were involv quit a familiar thing
it wa an aw night sometim cice slept a littl but the most
of it she spent in prayer the fierc emlyn neither slept nor prai
except onc or twice that vengeanc might fall upon the abbot head
for her whole soul wa up in arm and it gall her to think that she
and her belov mistress must die shamefulli while their enemi live on
triumphant and in honour even the infant seem nervou and disturb
as though some instinct warn it of terror at hand for although it wa
well enough against it custom it woke continu and wail
emlyn said cice toward morn but befor the light had come
after at length she had sooth it to rest do you think that mother
matilda will be abl to help us
no no put it from your mind deari she is weak and old the road
is rough and long and mayhap she ha never reach the place it wa a
great ventur for her to try such a journei and if she came there why
perhap the commission man had gone or perhap he will not listen
or perhap he cannot come what would he care about the burn of two
witch a hundr mile awai thi leech who is suck himself full
upon the carcass of some fat monasteri no no never count on her
at least she is brave and true emlyn and ha done her best for which
mai heaven bless rest upon her alwai now what of thoma boll
noth except that he is a redhead jackass that can brai but
darent kick answer emlyn vicious never speak to me of thoma
boll had he been a man long ago hed have broken the neck of that
rogu abbot instead of dress himself up like a hegoat and hunt
hi cow
if what thei sai is true he did break the neck of father ambros
repli cice with a faint smile perhap he made a mistak in the
dark
if so it is like thoma boll who ever wish the right thing and did

heart she shiver and whiten like an aspen in the wind then she rose
and thank god for hi merci which were great
oh if the strength of that hors of thoma boll had fail on short
five minut sooner she in whom the red blood still ran so healthili
would have been but a hand of char bone or if her faith had left
her so that she had yield to the abbot and shorten all hi talk at
the place of burn then boll would have come too late but it prove
suffici to her need and for thi also truli she should be thank
to it giver
after thei had eaten a messag came to them from the prioress who
desir to see them in her chamber thither thei went rejoic to find

chapter xiv
jacob and the jewel
cice journei to london wa strang enough to her who never befor
had travel farther than fifti mile from her home and but onc as a
child spent a month in a town when visit an aunt at lincoln she went
in eas it is true for commission legh did not love hard travel
and for thi reason thei start late and halt earli either at some
good inn if in those dai ani such place could be call good or
perhap in a monasteri where he claim of the best that the frighten
monk had to offer inde as she observ hi treatment of these poor
folk wa cruel for he bluster and threaten and inquir accus
them of crime that thei had not commit and final although he had
no mission to them at the time extract great gift sai that if
these were not forthcom he would make a note and return later also
he got hold of talebear and wrote down all their scandal and
ly stori told against those whose bread thei at
thu long befor thei saw chare cross cice came to hate thi
proud avarici and overbear man who hid a savag natur under a
cloak of virtu and whilst serv hi own end mouth great word
about god and the king still she who wa school in advers
learn to hide her heart fear to make an enemi of on who could
ruin her and forc emlyn much against her will to do the same
moreov there were wors thing than that sinc be beauti some
of hi companion talk to her in a wai she could not misunderstand
till at length thoma boll come on on of them thrash him as he
had never been thrash befor after which there wa troubl that wa
onli appeas by a gift
yet on the whole thing went well no on molest the king visitor
or those with him the autumn weather held fine the babi boi kept hi
health and the countri through which thei pass wa new to her and
full of interest
at last on even thei rode from barnet into the great citi which she
thought a most marvel place who had never seen such a multitud of
hous or of men run to and fro about their busi up and down the
narrow street that at night were lit with lamp now there had been a
great discuss where thei were to lodg dr legh sai that he knew
of a hous suitabl to them but emlyn would not hear of thi place
where she wa sure thei would be rob for the wealth that thei
carri secretli in jewel bore heavili on her mind rememb a
cousin of her mother of the name of smith a goldsmith who till
within a year or two befor wa aliv and dwell in cheapsid she
said that thei would seek him out
thither then thei rode guid by on of the visitor clerk not he
whom boll had beaten but anoth and at last after some search
found a dingi hous in a court and over it a sign on which were paint
three ball and the name of jacob smith emlyn dismount and the door
be open enter to be greet by an old whitebeard man with
horn spectacl thrust up over hi forehead and dark ey like her own
sinc the same gypsi blood ran strong in both of them
what pass between them cice did not hear but present the old man
came out with emlyn and look her and boll up and down sharpli for a
long while as though to take their measur at length he said that he
understood from hi cousin whom he now saw for the first time for
over thirti year that the two of them and their man desir lodg
which as he had empti room he would be pleas to give them if thei
would pai the price
cice ask how much thi might be and on hi name a sum ten silver
shill a week for the three of them and their hors that would
be stabl close by told emlyn to pai him a pound on account thi he
took bite the gold to see that it wa good but bid them in to
inspect the room befor he pouch it thei did so and find them
clean and commodi if somewhat dark close the bargain with him
after which thei dismiss the clerk to take their address to dr legh
who had promis to advis them so soon as he could put their busi
forward
when he wa gone and thoma boll conduct by smith apprentic
had led off the three hors and the packbeast the old man chang hi
manner and conduct them into a parlour at the back of hi shop sent
hi housekeep a middleag woman with a pleasant face to make readi
food for them while he produc cordial from squat dutch bottl which
he made them drink inde he wa all kind to them be as he
explain rejoic to see on of hi own blood for he had no relat
live hi wife and their two children have di in on of the london
sick also he wa blossholm born though he had left that place
fifti year befor and had known cice grandfath and plai with
her father when he wa a boi so he pli them with question after
question some of which thei thought it wa not to answer for he wa a
merri and talk old man
aha he said you would prove me befor you trust me and who can
blame you in thi naughti world but perhap i know more about you all
than you think sinc in thi trade my busi is to learn mani thing
for instanc i have heard that there wa a great try of witch down
at blossholm late whereat a certain abbot came off worst also that
the famou carfax jewel had been lost which vex the said holi abbot

thei should be lost sinc my ladi there would own them otherwis and
much should i have like who am a littl man in that trade to set my
old ey upon them well well perhap i shall perhap i shall yet
for that which is lost is sometim found again now here come your

thi wa the first of mani pleasant meal which thei share with their
host jacob smith soon emlyn found from inquiri that she made among
hi neighbour without seem to do so that thi cousin of her bore
an excel name and wa trust by all
then why should we not trust him also ask cice who must find
friend and put faith in some on
even with the jewel mistress
even with the jewel for such thing ar hi busi and thei would
be safer in hi strong chest than tack into our garment where the
thought of them haunt me night and dai
let us wait a while said emlyn for onc thei were in that box how
do we know if we should get them out again
on the morrow of thi talk the visitor legh came to see them and had no
cheer tale to tell accord to him the lord cromwel declar
that as the abbot of blossholm claim these shefton estat the
king stood or would soon stand in the shoe of the said abbot of
blossholm and therefor the king claim them and could not surrend
them moreov monei wa so want at court just then and here
legh look hard at them that there could be no talk of part with
anyth of valu except in return for a consider and he look
at them harder still
and how can my ladi give that broke in emlyn sharpli for she fear
lest cice should commit herself todai she is but a homeless pauper
save for a few pound in gold and even if she should come to her

put them down to grief and anger

thi to give notic to you hi grace and hi minist and all
other that we christoph harflet knight and jeffrei stoke
hi servant when journei from the seaport whither we had come from
spain were taken by rebel in arm against the king and brought here
to lincoln these men would win me to their parti becaus the name of
harflet is still strong and known so violent were thei that we have
taken some kind of oath yet thi write advis you that so i onli
did to save my life have no heart that wai who am a loyal man and
understand littl of their quarrel life in sooth is of small valu to
me who have lost wife land and all yet er i die i would be aveng

jacob took the letter and began to write swiftli while cromwel
thought

of that colour have drawn off north now foterel and harflet ar good
name yonder cannot you journei thither and rais a compani
ay ay that i can do broke in boll in a week i will have a
hundr men at my back give commiss and monei to my ladi there and

thi hous by nine of the clock tomorrow answer cromwel the
monei you must find for there is none outsid the coffer of jacob
smith yet paus ladi harflet there is risk and here you ar safe
i know the risk she answer but what do i care for risk who have
taken so mani when my husband is yonder and i mai serv him
an excel spirit let us trust that it come from on high remark
cromwel but old jacob as he wrote vera copia for hi lordship
signatur at the foot of the transcript of christoph letter shook
hi head sadli
in anoth minut cromwel had sign without troubl to compar the
two and with some gentl word of farewel wa gone have bigger
matter wait hi attent
cice never saw him again inde with the except of jacob smith
she never saw ani of those folk again includ the king who had been
concern in thi crisi of her life yet notwithstand hi cun
and hi extort she griev for cromwel when some four year later
the duke of suffolk and the earl of southampton rude tore the garter
and hi other decor off hi person and he wa hale from the
council to the tower and thenc after abject supplic for merci
to perish a crimin upon the block at least he had serv her well
for he kept all hi promis to the letter on of hi last act also
wa to send her back the pink pearl which he had receiv as a bribe
from jacob smith with a messag to the effect that he wa sure it would
becom her more than it had him and that he hope it would bring her a
better fortun
when cromwel had gone jacob turn to cice and inquir if she were
leav hi hous upon the morrow
have i not said so she ask with impati know what i know
how could i stai in london why do you ask
becaus i must balanc our account i think you ow me a matter of
twenti mark for rent and board also it is probabl that we shall need
monei for our journei and thi dai ha left me somewhat bare of coin
our journei said cice do you then accompani us master smith
with your leav i think so ladi time ar bad here i have no
shill left to lend yet if i do not lend i shall never be forgiven
also i need a holidai and er i die would onc again see blossholm
where i wa born should we live to reach it but if we start tomorrow
i have much to do thi night for instanc your jewel which i hold in
pawn must be set in a place of safeti also these deed whereof copi
should be made and that pearl must be left in trusti hand for sale so
at what hour do we ride on thi mad errand
at eleven of the clock answer cice if the king safeconduct
and commiss have come by then
so be it then i bid you goodnight come with me worthi boll for
therel be no sleep for us i go to call my clerk and you must go to
the stabl ladi harflet and you cousin emlyn get you to bed
on the follow morn cice rose with the dawn nor wa she sorri to
do so who had spent but a troubl night for long sleep would not come
to her and when it did at length she wa toss upon a sea of
dream dream of the king who threaten her with hi great voic of
cromwel who took everyth she had down to her cloak of commission
legh who drag her back to the stake becaus he had lost hi bribe
but most of all she dream of christoph her belov husband who wa
so near and yet as far awai as he had ever been a prison in the hand
of the rebel her husband who deem her dead
from all these phantasi she awok weep and oppress by fear
could it be that when at length the cup of joi wa so near her lip fate
wait to dash it down again she knew not who had naught but faith to
lean on that faith which in the past had serv her well meanwhil
she wa sure that if christoph live he would make hi wai to cranwel
or to blossholm and whatev the risk thither she would go also as
fast as hors could carri her
hurri as thei would middai wa an hour gone er thei rode out of
cheapsid there wa so much to do and even then thing were left
undon the four of them travel humbl clad give out that thei
were a parti of merchant folk return to cambridg after a visit to
london as to an inherit in which thei were interest especi
cice who pose as a widow name johnson thi wa their stori which
thei vari from time to time accord to circumst in some wai
their mind were more at eas than when thei travel to the great
citi for now at least thei were clear of the horrid compani of
commission legh and hi peopl nor were thei haunt by the knowledg
that thei had about them jewel of great price all these jewel were
left behind in safe keep as were also the write under the king
hand and seal of which thei onli took attest copi and with them
the commiss that cromwel had duli sent to cice address to her
husband and herself and boll certif of captainci these thei
hid in their boot or the line of their vest togeth with such
monei as wa necessari for the cost of travel
thu ride hard for their hors were good and fresh thei came
unmolest to cambridg on the night of the second dai and slept there
beyond cambridg thei were told the countri wa so disturb that
it would not be safe for them to journei but just when thei were in
despair for even boll said that thei must not go on a troop of the
king hors arriv on their wai to join the duke of norfolk wherev
he might lie in lincolnshir
to their captain on jeffrei jacob show the king commiss
reveal who thei were see that it command all hi grace
offic and servant to do them servic thi captain jeffrei said
that he would give them escort until their road separ so next dai
thei went on again the compani wa not pleasant for the men of whom
there were about a hundr prove rough fellow still have been
warn that he who insult or laid a finger on them should be hang
thei did them no harm it wa well inde that thei had their
protect for thei found the countri through which thei pass up in
arm and were more than onc threaten by mob of peasant led by
priest who would have attack them had thei dare
for two dai thei travel thu with captain jeffrei come on the
even of the second to peterborough where thei found lodg at an
inn when thei rose the next morn howev it wa to discov that
jeffrei and hi men had alreadi gone leav a messag to sai that he
had receiv urgent order to push on to lincoln
now onc more thei told their old tale declar that thei were
citizen of boston and have learn that the fen were peac
perhap becaus so few peopl live in them start forward by
themselv under the guidanc of boll who had often journei through
that countri bui or sell cattl for the monk an ill land wa
it to travel in also in that wet autumn see that in mani place the
flood were out and the track were like a quagmir the first night
thei spent in a marshman hut listen to the pour rain and
fear fever and agu especi for the boi the next dai by good
fortun thei reach higher land and slept at a tavern
here thei were visit by rude men who be of the parti of
rebellion sought to know their busi for a while thing were
danger but boll who could talk their own dialect show that
thei were scarc to be fear who travel with two women and a babe
ad that he wa a laybroth of blossholm abbei disguis as a
servingman for dread of the king parti jacob smith also call for
al and drank with them to the success of the pilgrimag of grace as
their revolt wa name
in thi wai thei disarm suspicion with on tale and anoth
moreov thei heard that as yet the countri round blossholm remain
undisturb although it wa said that the abbot had fortifi the abbei
and store it with provis he himself wa with the leader of the
revolt in the neighbourhood of lincoln but he had done thi that he
might have a strong place to fall back on
so in the end the men went awai full of strong beer and that danger
pass by
next morn thei start forward earli hope to reach blossholm by
sunset though the dai were shorten much thi howev wa not
to be for as it chanc thei were badli bog in a quagmir that lai
about two mile off their inn and when at length thei scrambl out had
to ride mani mile round to escap the swamp so it happen that it
wa alreadi well on in the afternoon when thei came to that stretch of
forest in which the abbot had murder sir john foterel follow the
woodland road toward sunset thei pass the mere where he had fallen
weari as she wa cice look at the spot and found it familiar
i know thi place she said where have i seen it oh in the ill
dream i had on that dai i lost my father
that is not wonder answer emlyn who rode besid her carri
the child see that thoma sai it wa just here thei butcher him
look yonder lie the bone of meg hi mare i know them by her black
mane
ay ladi broke in boll and there he li also where he fell thei
buri him with never a christian prayer and he point to a littl

chapter xvii
between doom and honour
the dai wa about to break when at last utterli worn out in bodi and
mind cice and her parti rode their stumbl hors up to the gate
of blossholm priori
prai god the nun ar still here said emlyn who held the child for
if thei have been driven out and my mistress must go farther i think
that she will die knock hard thoma that old garden is deaf as a
wall
boll obei with good will till present the grill in the door wa
open and a trembl woman voic ask who wa there
that mother matilda said emlyn and slip from her hors she
ran to the bar and began to talk to her through them then other nun
came and between them thei open on of the larg gate for the
garden either could not or would not be arous and pass through it
into the courtyard where when it wa understood that cice had realli
come again there wa a great welcom but now she could hardli speak
so thei made her swallow a bowl of milk and took her to her old room
where sleep of some kind overcam her when she awok it wa nine of the
clock emlyn look littl the wors wa alreadi up and stood talk
with mother matilda
oh cri cice as memori came back to her ha aught been heard of
my husband
thei shook their head and the prioress said
first you must eat sweet and then we will tell you all we know which
is littl
so she at who need food sadli and while emlyn help her to dress
herself hearken to the new it wa of no great account onli
confirm that which thei had learnt from the fenmen that the abbei
wa fortifi and guard by strang soldier rebelli men from the
north or foreign and the abbot suppos to be awai
boll who had been out report also that a man he met declar that
he had heard a troop of horsemen pass through the villag in the night
but of thi no proof wa forthcom sinc if thei had done so the
heavi rain that wa still fall had wash out all trace of them
moreov in those time peopl were alwai move to and fro in the
dark and none could know if thi troop had anyth to do with the band
thei had seen in the forest which might have gone some other wai
when cice wa readi thei went downstair and in mother matilda
privat room found jacob smith and thoma boll await them
ladi harflet said jacob with the air of a man who ha no time to
lose thing stand thu as yet none know that you ar here for we
have the garden and hi wife under ward but as soon as thei learn
it at the abbei there will be risk of an attack and thi place is not
defens now at your hall of shefton it is otherwis for there
it seem is a deep moat with a drawbridg and the rest to shefton
therefor you must go at onc unobserv if mai be inde thoma ha
been there alreadi and spoken to certain of your tenant whom he can
trust who ar now hard at work prepar and victual the place
and pass on the word to other by nightfal he hope to have thirti
strong men to defend it and within three dai a hundr when your
commiss and hi captainci ar made known come then for there is no
time to tarri and the hors ar saddl
so cice kiss mother matilda who bless and thank her for all she
had done or tri to do on behalf of the sisterhood and within five
minut onc more thei were on the back of their weari beast and
ride through the rain to shefton which happili wa but three
mile awai keep under the lee of the wood thei left the priori
unobserv for in that wet few were stir and the sentinel at
the abbei if there were ani had taken shelter in the guardhous so
thankfulli enough thei came unmolest to wall and wood shefton
which cice had last seen when she fled thenc to cranwel on the
dai of her marriag oh year and year ago or so it seem to her
torment heart
it wa a strang and a sad homecom she thought as thei rode over
the drawbridg and through the sodden and weedsmoth pleasaunc to
the familiar door yet it might have been wors for the tenant whom
boll had warn had not been idl for two hour past and more a dozen
will women had swept and clean the fire had been lit and there
wa plenteou food of a sort in the kitchen and the storeroom
moreov in all the big hall were gather about a score of her peopl
who welcom her by rais their bonnet and even tri to cheer to
these at onc jacob read the king commiss show them the signet
and the seal and that other commiss which name thoma boll a
captain with wide power the sight and hear of which write seem
to put a great heart into them who so long had lack a leader and the
support of author on and all thei swore to stand by the king and
their ladi cice harflet and her lord sir christoph or if he
were dead hi child then about half of them took hors and rode off
thi wai and that to gather men in the king name while the rest
stai to guard the hall and work at it defenc
by sunset men were ride up from all side some of them drive cart
load with provis arm and fodder or sheep and beast that could
be kill for susten while as thei came jacob enrol their name
upon a paper and by virtu of hi commiss thoma boll swore them in
inde that night thei had forti men quarter there and the promis of
mani more
by now howev the secret wa out for the stori had gone round and
the smoke from the shefton chimnei told it own tale first a singl
spy appear on the opposit rise watch then he gallop awai to
return an hour later with ten arm and mount men on of whom carri
a banner on which were embroid the emblem of the pilgrimag
of grace these men rode to within a hundr pace of shefton hall
appar with the object of attack it then see that the
drawbridg wa up and that archer with bent bow stood on either side
halt and sent forward on of their number with a white flag to parlei
who hold shefton shout thi man and for what caus
the ladi harflet it owner and captain thoma boll for the caus
of the king call old jacob smith back to him
by what warrant ask the man the abbot of blossholm is lord of
shefton and thoma boll is but a laybroth of hi monasteri
by warrant of the king grace said jacob and then and there at the
top of hi voic he read to him the royal commiss which when the
envoi had heard he went back to consult with hi companion for a
while thei hesit appar still medit attack but in the end
rode awai and were seen no more
boll wish to follow and fall on them with such men as he had but the
cautiou jacob smith forbad it fear lest he should tumbl into
some ambush and be kill or captur with hi peopl leav the place
defenceless
so the afternoon went by and er even close in thei had so much
strength that there wa no more caus for fear of an attack from the
abbei whose garrison thei learn amount to not over fifti men and a
few monk for most of these had fled
that night cice with emlyn and old jacob were seat in the long upper
room where her father sir john foterel had onc surpris christoph
pai hi court to her when boll enter follow by a man with a
hangdog look who wa wrap in a sheepskin coat which seem to becom
him veri ill
who is thi friend ask jacob
an old companion of mine your worship a monk of blossholm who is
weari of grace and it pilgrimag and seek the king comfort and
pardon which i have made bold to promis to him
good said jacob ill enter hi name and if he remain faith
your promis shall be kept but why do you bring him here
becaus he bear tide
now someth in boll voic caus cice who wa brood apart to
look up sharpli and sai
speak and be swift
my ladi began the man in a slow voic i who am name basil in
religion have fled the abbei becaus although a monk i am true to
the king and moreov have suffer much from the abbot who ha just
return rage have met with some revers out lincoln wai i know
not what my new is that your lord sir christoph harflet and hi
servant jeffrei stoke ar prison in the abbei dungeon whither thei
were brought last night by a compani of the rebel who had captur them
and afterward rode on
prison exclaim cice then he is not dead or wound at least
he is whole and safe
ay my ladi whole and safe as a mous in the paw of a cat befor it
is eaten
the blood left cice cheek in her mind ey she saw abbot maldon
turn into a great cat with a monk head and pat christoph with
hi claw
my fault my fault she said in a heavi voic oh if i had not
call him he would have escap would that i had been stricken dumb
i dont think so answer brother basil there were other watch
for him ahead who when he wa taken went awai and that is how you came
to get through so neatli at least there he li and if you would save
him you had best gather what strength you can and strike at onc
doe he know that i live ask cice
how can i tell ladi the abbei dungeon ar no good place for
new yet the monk who took him hi food thi morn said that sir
christoph told him that he had been undon by some ghost which call
to him with the voic of hi dead wife as he rode near king grave
mount
now when cice heard thi she rose and left the room accompani by
emlyn for she could bear no more
but jacob smith and boll remain question the man close upon mani
matter and have learn all he could tell them sent him awai under
guard and sat there till midnight consult and make up their plan
with the farmer and yeomen whom thei call to them from time to time
next morn earli thei sought out cice and told her that to them it
seem wise that the abbei should be attack without delai
but my husband li there she answer in distress and then thei
will kill him
so i fear thei mai if we do not attack repli jacob moreov
ladi to tell the truth there ar other thing to be thought of for
instanc the king caus and honour which we ar bound to forward
and the live and good of all those who through us have declar
themselv for him if we lie idl abbot maldon will send messeng to
the north and within a few dai bring down thousand upon us against
whom we cannot hope to stand inde it is probabl that he ha
alreadi sent but if thei hear that the abbei ha fallen the rebel will
scarc come for reveng alon lastli if we sit with fold hand
our own peopl mai grow cold with doubt and fear and melt awai who
now ar hot as fire
if it must be so let it be in god hand i leav hi life said
cice in a heavi voic
that dai the king men under the captainci of boll advanc and
invest the abbei set their camp in blossholm villag cice
who would not be left behind came with them and onc more took up her
quarter in the priori which on a formal summon open it gate to
her it onli guard the deaf garden surrend at discret he
wa set to work as a camp servant and never in hi life did he labour
so hard befor sinc emlyn who ow him mani a grudg saw to it that
he did not lack for task that were mean and heavi
now that dai thoma and other spi out the abbei and return shake
their head for without cannonand as yet thei had noneth great
build of hewn stone seem almost impregn at but on spot inde
wa attack possibl from the back where onc stood the dormer and farm
stead which emlyn had eg on thoma to burn these had been built
up to the inner edg of the moat make as it were part of the abbei
wall but the fierc fire had so crack and crumbl their masonri that
sever rod of it had fallen forward into the water
for purpos of defenc the gap thi form wa now close by a doubl
palisad of stout stake fill in with faggot the char beam
of the old build and other rubbish yet to carri thi palisad
protect as it wa by the broad and deep moat and command from the
window and the corner tower wa more than thei dare try sinc if it
could be done at all it would certainli cost them veri mani live on
thing thei had learn howev from the monk basil and other that in
the abbei there wa but small store of food to feed so mani three dai
suppli said basil and none put it at over four
that even then thei held anoth council at which it wa
determin to starv the place out and onli attempt an onslaught if
their spi report to them that the rebel were march to it
relief
but urg cice then my lord and jeffrei stoke will starv also
whereon thei went awai sadli sai there wa no choic see that
thei were but two men and the live of mani lai at stake
the sieg began just such a sieg as cice had suffer at cranwel
tower the first dai the garrison of the abbei scof at them from the
wall the second dai thei scof no longer note that the forc of
the besieg increas which it did hourli the third dai suddenli
thei let down the drawbridg and pour out on to it as though for a
sorti but when thei perceiv the score of boll men wait bow
in hand and arrow on string chang their mind and drew the bridg up
again
thei grow hungri and desper said the shrewd jacob soon we shall
have some messag from them
he wa right sinc just befor sunset a postern gate wa open and a
man hold a white flag abov hi head wa seen swim across the
moat he scrambl out on the farther side shook himself like a dog
and advanc slowli to where boll and the women stood upon the abbei
green out of arrowshot from the wall inde cice who wa weak
with dread and wretched lean against the oaken stake that
had never been remov to which onc she wa ti to be burn for
witchcraft
who is that man said emlyn to her
cice scan the gaunt beard figur who walk haltingli like on
that is sick
i know noty ye he put me in mind of jeffrei stoke
jeffrei it is and no other said emlyn nod her head now what
new doe he bear i wonder
cice made no repli onli clung to her stake and wait with just such
a heart as onc she had wait there while the abbei cook blew up hi
brand to fire her faggot jeffrei wa opposit to her now hi sunken
ey fell upon her and at the sight hi beard chin drop make
hi face look even more long and hollow than it had befor
ah he said speak to himself mani war and journei month
in an infidel gallei three dai with not enough food to feed a rat and
a bath in novemb water well such thing to sai noth of a wors
turn men brain yet to think that i should live to see a daylight
ghost in home blossholm who never met with on befor
still stare he shook the water from hi beard then ad
laybroth or captain thoma boll whichev you mai be nowadai
if your not a ghost also give me a quart of strong al and a loaf of
bread for im empti as a gut her and float heavenward so to
speak who would stick upon thi scurvi earth
jeffrei jeffrei broke in cice what new of your master emlyn
tell him that we still live he doe not understand
oh you still live do you he ad slowli so the fire could not
burn you after all or emlyn either well then there hope for
everi on and perhap hunger and abbot maldon knive cannot kill
christoph harflet
he live then and is well
he live and is as well as a man mai be after a three dai fast in a
black dungeon that is somewhat damp here a write on the matter for
the captain of thi compani and take a letter from the fold of the
white flag in which it had been fasten he hand it to boll who as
he could not read pass it on to jacob smith just then a lad brought
the al for which jeffrei had ask and with it a platter of cold meat
and bread on which he fell like a famish hound drink in great
gulp and devour the food almost without chew it
by the saint you ar starv jeffrei said a yeoman who stood by
come with me and shift those wet cloth of your or you will take
harm and he led him off still eat to a tent that stood near by
meanwhil jacob have studi the letter with bent and anxiou brow
read it aloud it ran thu
to the captain of the king men from clement abbot of blossholm
by what warrant i know not you besieg us here threaten thi abbei
and it religi with fire and sword i am told that cice foterel

write sign and wit promis indemn on behalf of the king
for me and those with me for all that we mai have done against him and
hi law or privat against her and freedom to go where we will
without pursuit or hindranc or loss of land or chattel know that
tomorrow at the dawn we put to death christoph harflet knight in
punish of the murder and other crime that he ha commit against
us and in proof thereof hi bodi shall be hung from the abbei tower if
otherwis we will leav him unharm here where you shall find him after
we have gone for the rest ask hi servant jeffrei stoke whom we
send to you with thi letter
clement abbot
jacob finish read and a silenc fell upon all who listen
let us go to some privat place and consid thi matter said emlyn
nai broke in cice it is i who in my lord absenc hold the
king commiss and i will be heard thoma boll first send a man
under flag to the abbot sai that if aught of harm befal sir
christoph harflet ill put everi live soul within the abbei wall
to death by sword or rope and stand answer for it to the king
set it in write master smith and send with it copi of the king
commiss for my warrant at onc let it be done at onc
so thei went to a cottag near by which boll us as a guardhous
where thi stern messag wa written down copi out fair sign by
cice and by boll as captain with jacob smith for wit thi
paper togeth with a copi of the king commiss cice with her
own hand gave to a bold and trusti man charg to ask an answer who
depart carri the white flag and wear a steel shirt beneath hi
doublet for fear of treacheri
when he had gone thei sent for jeffrei who arriv clad in dry garment
and still eat for hi hunger wa that of a wolf
tell us all said cice
it will be a long stori if i begin at the begin ladi when your
worship father sir john and i rode awai from shefton on the dai of
hi murder
nai nai interrupt cice that mai stand we have no time my
lord and you escap from lincoln did you not and as we saw were
taken in the forest
ay ladi some tricksi spirit call out with your voic and he heard
and pull rein and so thei came on to us and overwhelm us though
without hurt as it chanc then thei brought us to the abbei and thrust
us into that accurs dungeon where save for a littl bread and water
we have starv for three dai in the dark that is all the tale
how then did you come out jeffrei
thu my ladi someth over an hour ago a monk and three guard
unlock the dungeon door while we blink at hi lantern like owl
in the sunlight the monk said that the abbot purpos to send me to the
camp of the king parti to offer christoph harflet life against
the live of all of them he told him harflet also that he had
brought ink and paper and that if he wish to save himself he would do
well to write a letter prai that thi offer might be accept sinc
otherwis he would certainli die at dawn
and what said my husband ask cice lean forward
what said he why he laugh in their face and told them that first
he would cut off hi hand on thi thei hale me out of the dungeon
roughli enough for i would have stai there with him to the end but
as the door close he shout after me tell the king offic to
burn thi rat nest and take no heed of christoph harflet who
desir to die
why doe he desir to die ask cice again
becaus he think hi wife dead mistress as i did and believ that
in the forest he heard her voic call him to join her
oh god oh god moan cice i shall be hi death
not so answer jeffrei do you know so littl of christoph
harflet that you think he would sell the king caus to gain hi own
life why if you yourself came and plead with him he would thrust you
awai sai get thee behind me satan
i believ it and i am proud mutter cice if need be let
harflet die well keep hi honour and our own lest he should live to
curs us go on
well thei led me to the abbot who gave me that letter which you have
and bade me take it and tell the case to whoever command here then he
lift up hi hand and lai it on the crucifix about hi neck swore
that thi wa no idl threat but that unless hi term were taken
harflet should hang from the tower top at tomorrow dawn ad
though i knew not what he meant i think youll find on yonder who
will listen to that reason now he wa dismiss me when a soldier
said
is it wise to free thi stoke you forget my lord abbot that he
is alleg to have wit a certain slai yonder in the forest and
will bear evid ay answer maldon i had forgotten who in
thi press rememb onli that no other man would be believ still
perhap it would be best to choos a differ messeng and to silenc
thi fellow at onc write down that jeffrei stoke a prison strove
to escap and wa kill by the guard in selfdef take him henc
and let me hear no more
now my blood went cold although i strove to look as careless as a man
mai on an empti stomach after three dai in the dark and curs him
prettili in spanish to hi face then as thei were hale me off
brother martindo you rememb him he wa our companion in some
troubl overseasstep forward out of the shadow and said of what
us is it abbot to stain your soul with so foul a murder sinc john
foterel di the king ha mani thing to lai to your account and ani
on of them will hang you should you fall into hi hand hell not
hark back to foterel death if inde you were to blame in that
matter
you speak roughli brother answer the abbot and act of war ar
not murder though perchanc afterward you might sai thei were to
save your own skin or other might well if so there wisdom in your
word touch not the man give him the letter and thrust him into the
moat to swim it hi li can make no odd in the count against us
well thei did so and i came here as you saw to find you live
and now i understand why maldon thought that harflet life is worth so
much and have done hi tale onc more jeffrei began to eat
cice look at him thei all look at himthi gaunt fierc man
who after mani other sorrow and strive had spent three dai in a
black dungeon with the rat fed upon water and a few finger of black
bread ye with the crawl rat and anoth man so dear to on of
them who still sat in that horrid hole wait to be hung like a felon
at the dawn the silenc with onli jeffrei munch to break it grew
pain so that all were glad when the door open and the messeng
whom thei had sent to the abbei appear he wa breathless have run
fast and somewhat disturb perhap becaus two arrow were stick
in hi back or rather in hi jerkin for the mail beneath had stop
them
speak said old jacob smith what is your answer
look behind me master and you will find it repli the man thei
set a ladder across the moat and a board on that over which a priest
trip to take my write i wait a while till present i heard a
voic hail me from the gatewai tower and look up saw abbot maldon
stand there with a face like that of a black devil
hark you knave he said to me get you gone to the witch
cice foterel and to the recreant monk boll whom i curs and
excommun from the fellowship of holi church and tell them to watch
for the first light of dawn for by it somewhat high up theyll see
christoph harflet hang black against the morn sky
on hear thi i lost my caution and halloo back
if so er tomorrow nightfal you shall keep him compani everi
on of you black against the even sky except those who go to be
quarter at tower hill and tyburn then i ran and thei shot at me
hit onc or twice but though old the mail wa good and here am
i unhurt except for bruis
a while later cice jacob smith thoma boll jeffrei stoke and
emlyn stower sat togeth take counselveri earnest counsel for the
case wa desper plan after plan wa brought forward and set asid
for thi reason or for that till at length thei stare at each other
emptili
emlyn exclaim cice at last in past dai you were wont to be
full of comfort word have you never a on in thi extrem for
all the while emlyn had sat silent
thoma said emlyn look up do you rememb when we were children
where we us to catch the big carp in the abbei moat
ay woman he answer but what time is thi for fish stori of
mani year ago as i wa sai of that tunnel underground there is no
hope beyond the grove it is utterli cave in and blocked tri
it if we had a week perhap
let her be broke in jacob she ha someth to tell us
and do you rememb went on emlyn that you told me that there
the carp were so big and fat becaus just at thi place neath the
drawbridg the abbei sewerth big abbei sewer down which all foul

a dark night a ladder with a plank on it a brick arch drain two
hundredweight or better still four of powder set beneath the gate
a slowmatch and a brave man to fire ittaken togeth with god
bless these thing might do much muse emlyn as though to
herself
now at length thei took her point
theyd be listen like a cat for a mous said boll
i think the wind rise she answer i hear it in the tree i think
present it will blow a gale also lantern might be shown at the back
where the breach is and men might shout there as though prepar to
attack that would draw them off meanwhil jeffrei stoke and i would
try our luck with the ladder and the keg of powderh to roll and i
to fire when the time came for be as you have heard a witch i
understand how to humour brimston
ten minut later and their plan were fix two hour later and
in the midst of a rave gale hidden by the pitchi dark and the
tower screen of the lift drawbridg emlyn and the strong jeffrei
roll the keg of powder over plank laid across the moat into the
mouth of the big drain and twenti feet down it till thei lai under the
gatewai tower then ly there in the stink filth thei drew the
spigot out of hole that thei had made in them and in their place set
the slowmatch jeffrei struck a flint blew the tinder to a glow and
hand it to emlyn
now get you gone she said i follow at thi job on is better than
two
a minut later she join him on the farther bank of the moat run
she said run for your life there death behind

gale all the guard hurri up the tower flash lantern to see
what pass
storm storm she cri up with the ladder for the kind and
harflet storm storm
then she too turn and fled
chapter xviii
out of the shadow
through the black night sudden and red there shot a sheet of fire
illumin all thing as lightn doe abov the roar of the gale

then after a moment paus and silenc the sky rain stone and with
them the limb of men

with the ladder
men who were wait ran up with them and thrust them four in all
athwart the moat by the plank that were lash along their stave

courtyard beyond where none wait them for all who watch here were
dead or maim
light the lantern shout boll again for it will be dark in
yonder and a man who follow with a torch obei him
then thei rush across the courtyard to the door of the refectori

of maldon peopl pour back from the faggot breach where thei had
been gather expect attack some of them also bear lantern for
a moment the two parti stood stare at each other then follow

cice knew not what to answer inde when thi mood wa on him it
wa hard to reason with christoph who had suffer so fearfulli and
like herself been save but by a miracl or the mandat of heaven
of a sudden a hush fell upon the place the blackbird ceas their
winter chatter in the laurel it grew so still that thei heard a dead
leaf drop to the ground the night wa at hand on last red rai from
the set sun struck across the frosti sky and wa reflect to the earth
in the light of that rai christoph train ey caught the gleam of
someth white that move in the shadow of the beech tree where thei

he made no answer inde it wa cice who spoke sai
how came you in such a case we thought you fled
ladi he answer iv starv for three dai and night in a hole
in the ground like an earthedup fox a culvert in your garden hid me
at last i crept out to see the light and die and heard you talk
and thought that i would ask for merci sinc mortal extrem ha no
honour
merci said cice of your treason i sai noth for you ar not
english and serv your own king who year ago sent you here to plot
against england but look on thi man my husband did he not starv
for three dai and night in your strong dungeon er you came thither to
massacr him did you not strive to burn him in hi hall and ship him
wound across the sea to doom did you not send your assassin to kill
my babe who stood between you and the wealth you need for your plot
and bind me the mother to the stakea food for fire did you not
shoot down my father in the wood fear lest he should prove you
traitor and after rob me of my heritag did you not compel your monk
to work evil and bring some of them to their death oh have done worm
dress up as god priest how can you writh there and ask for merci
i said i came to seek for merci becaus the agoni of sleepless hunger
drove me who now seek onli death insult not the fallen cice
foterel but take the vengeanc that is your due and kill repli
the abbot look up at her with hi hollow ey ad with a laugh
that sound like a groan come sir christoph you have got a sword
and it is time you went to supper the air is cold your wifeif such
she besaid it but now
cice said christoph go to the hall and summon jeffrei stoke
emlyn will know where to find him
emlyn groan the abbot give me not over to emlyn shed tortur

nai said christoph thi is not blossholm abbei though what mai

feet
i bid you go repeat christoph
and ill not obei she answer do you rememb what i promis

triumphant faith will do so to the end abbot maldon sin fallen
abbot maldon you ar as you were made and martin the saint said that
there is good in your heart though you have shown none of it to me or
mine now look you yonder is a wooden summerhous thatch and warm
get you there and ill send you food and wine and new cloth by on
who will not talk also a pass to lincoln by tomorrow dawn you will

of god with whom i prai you make your peac mai he forgiv you as
i do who know all heart which i do not now farewel nai sai
noth there is noth to be said come christoph for thi onc
you obei me not i you
so thei went and the wretch man rais himself upon hi hand and
look after them but what pass in hi heart at that moment none will
ever learn
some month had gone by and blossholm with all the countri round
wa onc more at peac the tide of troubl had roll awai northward
whenc came rumour of renew rebellion abbot maldon had been seen
no more and for a while it wa believ that although he never took
sanctuari at lincoln he had done a wiser thing and fled to spain then
emlyn who heard everyth got new that thi wa not so but that
he wa foremost among those who stir up sedit and war along the
scottish border
i can well believ it said cice the sow must to it wallow in
the mire natur made him a plotter and he will follow hi heart to the
end
er long he mai find it hard to follow hi head answer emlyn
grimli oh to think that you had that wolf cage and turn him loos
again to prei on england and on us
i did but show merci to the fallen nurs
merci i call it mad why when jeffrei and thoma heard of it i
thought thei would burst with rage especi jeffrei who love your
father well and love not the infidel gallei answer the fierc
emlyn
vengeanc is mine i will repai saith the lord murmur cice in a
gentl voic
the lord also said that whoso sheddeth man blood by man shall hi
blood be shed why iv heard thi maldon quot it to your husband at
cranwel tower
so will it be emlyn if so it is to be onli let other shed that
cruel blood i would not have it on my hand or on those of ani of my
hous for after all he is an ordain priest of my own faith moreov
i had promis still talk not of the matter lest it should bring
troubl on us all who had no right to loos him also these ar ill
thought for your wed dai go deck yourself in those fine cloth
which jacob smith ha sent from london sinc the clergyman will be
at blossholm church by four and i think that thoma ha wait long
enough for you
emlyn smile a littl and shrug her broad shoulder mutter
someth that would have anger thoma if he could have heard it
as cice went off to join christoph who call to her from anoth
room
she found him ad up figur on paper a veri differ christoph
to the broken man thei had rescu from the dungeon though still much
ag by the terror of the past year and just now look rueful
see sweet he said we should give a marriag portion to emlyn who
ha earn it if ever woman did but where it is to come from i know
not those abbei land jacob smith bought from the king ar not your
yet nor henri either though doubtless he will have them soon
neither have ani rent been paid to you from your own estat and when
thei come thei ar promis up in london while the abbot razor ha
shave my own poor parsimoni bare as a churchyard skull also mother
matilda and her nun must be kept till we can endow them with their
land again on dai we or our boi yonder mai be rich but till it
come there ar hard time for all of us
not so hard as some we have known husband she answer laugh
for at least we ar free and have food to eat and for the rest we will
borrow from jacob smith on the jewel that remain over inde i have
written to him and he will not refus
ay but how about thoma and emlyn
thei must do as their better do though there is littl stock on it
thoma ha the manor farm at low rent which he mai pai when he can
while jacob put a present in the pocket of emlyn wed dress what
more i think he will make her hi heir and if so she will be rich
inde so rich that i shall have to curtsei to her now go make readi
for thi marriag and as you have no fine doublet bid jeffrei put on
your mail for you look best in that or so at least i think who to my
mind look best in anyth you chanc to wear
then while he demur sai that there wa now no need to bear arm
in blossholm also that jeffrei wa awai settl himself as landlord
of the ford inn the same that the abbot had onc promis to flounder
megg she kiss him and seiz her boi who lai crow in the
sunlight danc with him from the room for oh cice heart wa
merri
there were mani folk at the marriag of emlyn stower and thoma boll
for of late blossholm had been but a sorri place and thi wed came
to it like the breath of spring to the wood and mead around a hint
of happi after the miseri of winter the stori of the pair had got
about also how thei had been pledg in youth and separ by scheme
men for their own purpos how emlyn had been marri off against her
will to an ag partner whom she hate and thoma who wa set down as
a fool forc to serv the monasteri as a laybroth a strong hind
skill in the manag of cattl and such matter but half crazi as
inde it had suit him to feign himself to be
peopl knew the end of the thing also that emlyn had curs the abbot
and that her curs had been fulfil that thoma boll had shaken off
hi superstiti fear and risen up against him and at last been given
the commiss of the king and as hi grace offic shown himself
no fool but a man of mettl who had taken the abbei by storm and
rescu sir christoph harflet from it dungeon emlyn also like her
mistress had been bound to the stake as a witch and save from burn
by thi same thoma who with her had been concern in mani remark
event whereof the countrysid wa full of tale true or fals now at
last after all these adventur thei came togeth to be wed and who
wa there for ten mile round that would not see it done
the monk be gone father roger necton the old vicar of cranwel he
who had unit christoph and hi wife cice in strang circumst
and for that deed been oblig to fly for hi life when the last abbot
of blossholm burn cranwel tower came to tie the knot befor hi
great congreg notwithstand that thei were both of middl
ag emlyn in her grand gown and the brawni redhair thoma in hi
yeoman garb of green such as he had worn when he woo her mani year
befor he put on the monk russet robe made a fine and handsom pair
at the altar or so folk thought though some friend of the monk
rememb boll devil liveri and emlyn reput as a sorceress
cri out from the shadow that satan wa marri a witch and for hi
pain got hi head broken by jeffrei stoke
so the whitehair and gentl father necton have first read the
king order releas thoma from hi vow ti them fast accord to
the ancient rite and bless them both at length it wa finish and
the pair walk from the old church to the manor farm where thei were
to dwell follow as wa the custom by a compani of their friend
and wellwish as thei went thei pass through a littl stretch of
woodland by the stream where on thi spring dai the wild daffodil and
lili of the vallei were abloom make sweet the air here emlyn paus
a moment and said to her husband captain boll
do you rememb thi place
ay wife he answer it wa here that we plight our troth in
youth and look up to see maldon pass us just beyond that same oak
and felt the shadow of him strike cold to our heart you spoke of it
yonder in the priori chapel when i came up by the secret wai and it
memori made me mad
ye thoma i spoke of it answer emlyn in a rich and gentl
voic a new voic to him well now let it memori make you happi as
notwithstand all my fault i will if i can and swiftli she bent
toward him and kiss him ad come on husband thei press behind
us and i hope that we have done with peril and plot
amen answer boll and as he spoke certain strang men who wore
the king colour and carri a long ladder went by them at a distanc
wonder what wa their busi at blossholm the pair pass through
the last of the woodland and reach the rise whenc thei could see the
gaunt skeleton of the burntout abbei that appear within fifti pace
of them at thi thei paus to look and present were join there
by christoph and cice mother matilda and her good nun jeffrei
stoke and other the place seem grim and desol in the even
light and all of them stood stare at it fill with their separ
thought
what is that said cice with a start point to a round black
object new set over the ruin of the gatewai tower
just then a red rai from the sunset struck upon the thing
it wa the sever head of clement maldon the spaniard
end of project gutenberg the ladi of blossholm by h rider haggard
