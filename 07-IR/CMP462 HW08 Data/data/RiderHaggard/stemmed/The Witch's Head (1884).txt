of two room and a passag on to thi build were attach a seri
of low greenhous and against the wall at the farther end of these
hous wa a leanto in which stood the boiler that suppli the pipe
with hot water the littl redbrick build wa mr carduss offic
for he wa a lawyer by profess the long tail of glass behind it
were hi orchidhous for orchidgrow wa hi sole amus the
tout ensembl offic and orchidhous seem curious out of
place in the grei and ancient courtyard where thei stood look as
thei did on to the old onestori hous scar by the passag of
centuri of tempestu weather some such idea seem to strike mr
cardu as he close the door behind him preparatori to cross the

that between reginald cardu esquir misanthrop of dum ness and
mr reginald cardu solicitor chairman of the stokesli board of
guardian bailiff of kesterwick c and yet in both case thei ar
part of the same establish case of old and new style
mr cardu did not make hi wai straight to the offic he struck off
to the right and enter the long line of glasshous walk up
from hous to hous till he reach the compart where the
temper sort were place to bloom which wa connect with hi
offic by a glass door through thi last he walk softli with a
catlik step till he reach the door where he paus to observ a
larg coars man who wa stand at the far end of the room look
out intent on the courtyard
ah my friend he said to himself so the shoe is begin to
pinch well it is time then he push the door softli open pass
into the room with the same catlik step close it and seat

if we lawyer wait for our client to tell us all their thought
mr de talor it would often take us a long time to reach the truth

jeremi at onc went up at least fifti per cent in ernest
estim
on their wai back to the hous thei peep in through the offic
window and ernest saw hardrid atterleigh at hi work copi
deed
he your grandfath isnt he

devil whom he must serv for a certain number of year he ha got a
stick with number of notch on it and he cut out a notch everi
month it is all veri sad i think it is a veri sad world and she
sigh again
why doe he wear huntingcloth ask ernest
becaus he alwai us to ride a good deal he love a hors now
sometim you will see him get up from hi write tabl and the
tear come into hi ey if anybodi come into the yard on horseback
onc he came out and tri to get on to a hors and ride off but thei
stop him
why dont thei let him ride
o he would soon kill himself old jack tare who live at
kesterwick and get hi live by rat and ferret us to be whip
to grandfath hound when he had them and sai that he alwai wa
a littl mad about ride on moonlight night he and grandfath went
out to hunt a stag that had strai here out of some park thei put
the stag out of a littl grove at a place call claffton five mile
awai and he took them round by starton and ashleigh and then came
down the flat to the sea about a mile and a half below here just
thi side of the quicksand the moon wa so bright that it wa almost
like dai and for the last mile the stag wa in view not more than a
hundr yard in front of the hound and the pace wa race when he
came to the beach he went right through the wave out to the sea and
the hound after him and grandfath after them thei caught him a
hundr yard out and kill him and then grandfath turn hi
hors head and swam with the hound
my ey wa ernest comment on thi stori and what did jack tare
do
o he stop on the beach and said hi prayer he thought that thei
would all be drown
then thei pass through the old hous which wa built on a littl
ness or headland that jut beyond the level of the shorelin and
across which the wind swept and rave all the winter long drive the
great wave in ceaseless thunder against the sandi cliff it wa a
desol spot that the grei and massiv hous of which the roof wa
secur by huge block of rock look out upon nude of veget
save for rank rushlik grass and plant of seaholli in front wa
the great ocean rush in continu upon the sandi bulwark and
with but few ship to break it loneli to the left far as the
ey could reach ran a line of cliff till it wa as full of gap as
an old crone jaw behind thi stretch mile upon mile of
desolatelook land cover for the most part with ling and heath
and cut up with dike whenc the water wa pump by mean of
windmil that gave a dutch appear to the landscap
look said dorothi point to a small white hous about a mile and
a half awai up the shorelin that is the lockhous where the
great sluiceg ar and beyond that is the dread quicksand in
which a whole armi wa onc swallow up like the egyptian in the
red sea
my word said ernest much interest and i sai did my uncl
build thi hous
you silli boi why it ha been built for hundr of year somebodi
of the name of dum built it and that is why it is call dum ness
at least i suppos so there is an old chart that reginald ha which
wa made in the time of henri vii and it is mark as dum ness
there so dum must have live befor then look she went on as
turn to the right thei round the old hous and reach the road
which ran along the top of the cliff there ar the ruin of
titheburgh abbei and she point to the remain of an enorm
church with a still perfect tower that stood within a few hundr
yard of them almost upon the edg of the cliff
why dont thei build it up again ask ernest
dorothi shook her head becaus in a few year the sea will swallow
it nearli all the graveyard ha gone alreadi it is the same with
kesterwick where we ar go kesterwick wa a great town onc the
king of east anglia made it their capit and a bishop live there
after that it wa a great port with thousand upon thousand of
inhabit but the sea came on and on and choke up the harbour and

chapter iv
boi togeth
jeremi kept hi word on the appoint dai he appear readi as he
express it to tackl that bloke halford what is more he
appear with hi hair cut a decent suit of cloth on and wonder of
wonder hi hand properli wash for all of which he wa reward
by find that the tackl wa not such a fear busi as he
had anticip it wa moreov of an intermitt natur for the
lad found plenti of time to indulg in everi sort of manli exercis
togeth in winter thei would roam all over the wide marshland in
search of snipe and wild duck which ernest miss and jeremi brought
down with uner aim and in summer thei would swim or fish and
birdnest to their heart content in thi wai thei contriv to
combin the absorpt of a littl learn with that of a realli
extend knowledg of anim life and a larg quantiti of health and
spirit
thei were happi year those for both the lad and to jeremi when
he compar them to hi life as it had been befor ernest came thei
seem perfectli heavenli for whether it wa that he had improv in
hi manner sinc then or that ernest stood as a buffer between him
and mr cardu it certainli happen that he came into collis with
him far less often inde it seem to jeremi that the old gentleman
it wa the fashion to call mr cardu old though he wa in realiti
onli middleag wa more toler of him than formerli though he
knew that he would never be a favourit
as for ernest everybodi love the boi and then as afterward he
wa a great favourit with women who would on and all do anyth he
ask it wa a wonder that he did not get spoil by it all but he
did not it wa not possibl to know ernest kershaw at ani period of
hi life without take a fanci to him he wa so emin and
unaffectedli a gentleman and so complet free from ani sort of
swagger alwai readi to do a kind and never forget on done
gener with hi possess to such an extent that he seem to have
a vagu idea that thei were the common properti of hi friend and
himself possess that greatest of gift a sympathet mind and
true as steel no wonder that he wa alwai popular both with men and
women
ernest grew into a handsom lad too as soon as he began to get hi
height with a shape form a beauti pair of ey and an
indescrib appear of manli and spirit but the greatest
charm of hi face wa alwai it quick intellig and unvari
kindli
as for jeremi he did not chang much he simpli expand veri
larg year by year hi form assum more and more enorm
proport and hi strength grew more and more abnorm as for hi
mind it did not grow with the same rapid and wa loth to admit a
new idea but onc it wa in it never came out again
he had a rule passion too thi dull giant and that wa hi
intens affect and admir for ernest it wa an affect that
grew with hi growth till it becam a part of himself increas with
the increas year till at last it wa nearli pathet in it
entireti it wa but rare that he part from ernest except
inde on those occas when ernest chose to go abroad to pursu
hi studi of foreign languag of which he wa rather fond then and
then onli jeremi would strike he dislik part with ernest much
but he objectedb intens insularto cohabit with foreign
yet more so on these occas and these onli for a while thei
separ
so the year wore on till when thei were eighteen mr cardu after
hi sudden fashion announc hi intent of send them both to
cambridg ernest alwai rememb it for it wa on that veri dai
that he first made the acquaint of florenc ceswick he had just
issu from hi uncl presenc and wa seek dolli to
commun the intellig to her when he suddenli blunder in
upon old miss ceswick and with her a young ladi thi young ladi to
whom miss ceswick introduc him as her niec at onc attract hi
attent on be introduc the girl who wa about hi own ag
touch hi outstretch palm with her slender finger throw on
him at the same moment so sharp a look from her brown ey that he
afterward declar to jeremi that it seem to go right through him
she wa a remarkablelook girl the hair which curl profus
over a shape head wa like the ey brown the complexion oliv
the featur were small and the lip full curv over a beauti
set of teeth in person she wa rather short but squar built and
at her earli ag her figur wa perfectli form inde she might to
all appear have been much older than she wa there wa littl of
the typic girl about her while he wa still observ her hi
uncl came into the room and wa duli introduc by the old ladi to
her niec who had she said come to share her loneli
how do you like kesterwick miss florenc ask mr cardu with
hi usual courtli smile
it is much what i expecteda littl duller perhap she answer
composedli
ah perhap you have been accustom to a gayer spot
ye till my mother di we live at brighton there is plenti of
life there not that we could mix in it we were too poor but at ani
rate we could watch it
do you like life miss florenc
ye we onli live such a short time i should like she went on
throw her head back and halfclos her ey to see as much as
i can and to exhaust everi emot
perhap miss florenc you would find some of them rather
unpleas answer mr cardu with a smile
possibl but it is better to travel through a bad countri than to
grow in a good on
mr cardu smile again the girl interest him rather
do you know miss ceswick he said chang the subject and
address the state old ladi who wa sit smooth her lace
and look rather aghast at her niec utter that thi young
gentleman is go to colleg and jeremi too
inde said miss ceswick i hope that you will do great thing
there ernest
while ernest wa disclaim ani intent of the sort miss florenc
cut in again rais her ey from a deep contempl of that young
gentleman long shank which were writh under her keen glanc
and twist themselv serpentwis round the leg of the chair
i did not know she said that thei took boi at colleg
then thei took their leav and ernest stigmatis her to dorothi as a
beast
but she wa at least attract in her own peculiar fashion and
dure the next year or two he becam rather intim with her
so ernest and jeremi went up to cambridg but did not set the place
on fire nor were the voic of tutor loud in their prais jeremi
it is true row on year in the varsiti race and perform
prodigi of strength and so cover himself with a sort of glori
which person be of a modest mind he did not particularli
appreci ernest did not even do that but by hook or by crook at
the termin of their collegi career thei took some sort of
degre and then depart from the shore of the cam on which thei
had spent mani a jovial dayjeremi to return to kesterwick and
ernest to pai sever visit to colleg friend in town and elsewher
thu end the first littl round of their dai
chapter v
eva promis
when on leav cambridg jeremi got back to dum ness mr cardu
receiv him with hi usual semicontemptu cold a mental
attitud that often nearli drove the young fellow wild with
mortif not that mr cardu realli felt ani contempt for him
nowh had lost all that year ago when the boi had been so anxiou
to go and earn hi bread but he could never forgiv him for be
the son of hi father or conquer hi inher dislik to him on the
other hand he certainli did not allow thi to interfer with hi
treatment of the lad if anyth inde it made him more care
what he spent upon ernest the same sum he spent on jeremi pound for
pound but there wa thi differ about itth monei he spent on
ernest he gave from love and that on jeremi from a sens of duti
now jeremi knew all thi well enough and it made him veri anxiou to
earn hi own live and becom independ of mr cardu but it wa
on thing to be anxiou to earn your own live and quit anoth to
do it as mani a poor wretch know to hi cost and when jeremi set
hi slow brain to consid how he should go about the task it quit
fail to suppli him with ani feasibl idea yet he did not want much
jeremi wa not of an ambiti tempera if he could earn enough to
keep a cottag over hi head and find himself in food and cloth
and powder and shot he would be perfectli content inde there were
to be onli two sine qua non in hi ideal occup it must admit
of a consider amount of outdoor exercis and be of such a natur
as would permit him to see plenti of ernest without more or less of
ernest compani life would not he consid be worth live
for a week or more after hi arriv home these perplex reflect
simmer incessantli insid jeremi head till at length feel
that thei were get too much for him he determin to consult hi
sister which as she had three time hi brain he would have done
well to think of befor
dolli fix her steadi blue ey upon him and listen to hi tale in
silenc
and so you see dollh alwai call her dollh end up im
in a regular fix i dont know what im fit for unless it to row a
boat or let myself out to bad shot to kill their game for them you
see i must stick on to ernest i dont feel somehow as though i could
get along without him if it wasnt for that id emigr i should be
just the chap to cut down big tree in vancouv island or brand
bullock he ad medit

you alwai were clever doll youv got all the brain and iv got
all the size and he survei as much as he could see of himself

you if he could do it with a clear conscienc and then where would
you be i should like to know
jeremi wa unabl to form an opinion as to where he would be so she
went on
you must take it for the present at ani rate then there is anoth
thing to think of ernest is to go to the bar and unless you becom a
lawyer if anyth happen to reginald there will be nobodi to give
him a start and im told that is everyth at the bar
thi last jeremi admit to be a weighti argument
it is a preciou queer sort of lawyer i shall make he said sadli

thu adjur jeremi remov hi larg form from the tabl on which he
had been sit and whistl to nail now a veri ancient and
preternatur wise dog set off for a walk he had moon along some
littl wai with hi hand in hi pocket and hi ey on the ground
reflect on the unpleas fate in store for him as an articl
clerk continu under the glanc of mr carduss rove ey when
suddenli he becam awar that two ladi were stand on the edg of
the cliff within a dozen yard of him he would have turn and fled
for jeremi had a mark dislik to ladi societi and a strong
opinion which howev he never express that women were the root
of all evil but think that he had been seen he fear that
retreat would appear rude in on of the young ladi for thei were
young he recognis miss florenc ceswick who to all appear had
not chang in the least sinc some year ago she came with her aunt
to call on dorothi there were the same brown hair curl as
profus as ever the same keen brown ey and ripe lip the same
small featur and resolut express of face her squar figur had
inde develop a littl in her tightfit dress it look almost
handsom and somehow it veri squar that most women would have
consid a defect contribut to the air of power and unchang
purpos that would have made florenc ceswick remark among a
hundr handsom women
how do you do said florenc in her sharp manner you look as
though you were walk in your sleep
befor jeremi could find a repli to thi remark the other young ladi
who had been look intent over the edg of the cliff turn round
and struck him dumb in hi limit experi he had never seen such
a beauti woman befor
she wa a head and shoulder taller than her sister so tall inde
that onli her own natur grace could save her from look awkward
like her sister she wa a brunett onli of a much more pronounc
type her wave hair wa black and so were her beauti ey and
the long lash that curl over them the complexion wa a clear
oliv the lip were like coral and the teeth small and regular
everi advantag that natur can lavish on a woman she had endow her
with in abund includ radiant health and spirit to these
charm must be ad that sweet and kindli look which sometim find
a home on the face of good women a soft voic a quick intellig
and an utter absenc of conceit or selfconsci and the reader
will get some idea of what eva ceswick wa like in the first flush of
her beauti
let me introduc my sister eva mr jone
but mr jone wa for the moment paralys he could not even take off
hi hat

wake peopl up and he took off hi hat which wa as usual a dirti
on and mutter someth inaud as for eva she blush and
with readi wit said that mr jone wa no doubt astonish at the
filthi state of her dress as a matter of fact jeremi could not have
sworn that she had on on at all much less to it condit the
fact is she went on i have been ly flat on the grass and
look over the edg of the cliff

the spot on which thei were stand wa part of the ancient graveyard
of titheburgh abbei and as the sea encroach year by year
multitud of the bone of the longdead inhabit of kesterwick
were wash out of their quiet grave and strew upon the beach and
unequ surfac of the cliff
look she said kneel down an exampl that he follow about
six feet below them which wa the depth at which the corps had been
origin laid could be seen fragment of lead and rot wood
project from the surfac of the cliff and what wa a more ghastli
sight eight inch or more of the legbon of a man off which the
feet had been wash awai on a ledg in the sandi cliff about
twentyf feet from the top and sixti or so from the bottom there
lai quit a collect of human remain of all sort and size
conspicu among them be the bone which had compos the feet
that belong to the project shank
isnt it dread said eva gaze down with a speci of
fascin just fanci come to that look at that littl babi
skull just by the big on perhap that is the mother and what is
that buri in the sand
as much of the object to which she point as wa visibl look like
an old cannonbal but jeremi soon came to a differ conclus
it is a bit of lead coffin he said
oh i should like to get down there and find out what is in it cant
you get down
jeremi shook hi head iv done it as a boi he said when i wa
veri light but it is no good my try now the sand would give with
me and i should go to the bottom
he wa will to do most thing to oblig thi love creatur but
jeremi wa abov all thing practic and did not see the us of
break hi neck for noth
well she said you certainli ar rather heavi
fifteen stone he said mournfulli
but i am not ten i think i could get down
youd better not try without a rope
just then their convers wa interrupt by florenc clear
voic

centuri ago ha the greatest charm for my sister she would like
to go home and make stori about those bone whose thei were and
what thei did and all the rest of it she call it imagin i

what a great oaf that jeremi is said florenc to her sister on
their homeward wai
i did not think him an oaf at all she repli warmli i thought

chapter vi
jeremi fall in love
jeremi for the first time for some year had no appetit for hi
dinner that dai a phenomenon that fill dorothi with alarm
my dear jeremi she said afterward what can be the matter with
you you had onli on help of beef and no pud
noth at all he repli sulkili and the subject drop
doll said jeremi present do you know miss eva ceswick
ye i have seen her twice
what do you think of her doll
what do you think of her repli that cautiou young person
i think she is beauti asa an angel
quit poetic i declar what next have you seen her
of cours els how should i know she wa beauti
ah no wonder you had onli onc of beef
jeremi colour
i am go to call there thi afternoon would you like to come
went on hi sister
ye ill come
better and better it will be the first call i ever rememb your
have paid
you dont think she will mind doll
why should she mind most peopl dont mind be call on even if
thei have a pretti face
pretti face she is pretti all over
well then a pretti all over i start at three dont be late
thereupon jeremi went off to beautifi himself for the occas and
hi sister gaze at hi depart form with the puzzl express
that had distinguish her as a child
he go to fall in love with her she said to herself and no
wonder ani man would she is pretti all over as he said and what
more doe a man look at i wish that she would fall in love with him
befor ernest come home and she sigh
at a quarter to three jeremi reappear look particularli huge in
a black coat and hi sundai trouser when thei reach the cottag
where miss ceswick live with her niec thei were destin to meet
with a disappoint for neither of the young ladi wa at home
miss ceswick howev wa there and receiv them veri cordial
i suppos that you have come to see my newli import niec she
said in fact i am sure that you have mr jeremi becaus you never
came to call upon me in your life ah it is wonder how young men
will chang their habit to pleas a pair of bright ey
jeremi blush painfulli at thi salli but dorothi came to hi
rescu
ha miss eva come to live with you for good she ask
ye i think so you see my dear between you and me her aunt in
london with whom she wa live ha got a famili of daughter who
have recent come out eva ha been kept back as long as possibl
but now that she is twenti it wa imposs to keep her back ani
more but then on the other hand it wa feltat least i think that
it wa feltthat to continu to bring eva out with her cousin would
be quit to ruin their chanc of settl in life becaus when she
wa in the room no man could be got to look at them so you see
eva ha been sent down here as a penalti for be so handsom
most of us would be glad to undergo heavier penalti than that if we
could onli be guilti of the crime said dorothi a littl sadli
ah my dear i daresai you think so answer the old ladi everi
young woman long to be beauti and get the admir of men but
ar thei ani the happier for it i doubt it veri often that
admir bring endless troubl in it train and perhap in the
end wreck the happi of the woman herself and of other who ar
mix up with her i wa onc a beauti woman my deari am old
enough to sai it nowand i can tell you that i believ that
provid cannot do a more unkind thing to a woman than to give her
strike beauti unless it give with it great strength of mind a
weakmind beauti is the most unfortun of her sex her veri
attract which ar sure to draw the secret enmiti of other women
on to her ar a sourc of difficulti to herself becaus thei bring
her lover with whom she cannot deal sometim the end of such a
woman is sad enough i have seen it happen sever time my dear
often in afterlif and in circumst that had not then arisen
did dorothi think of old miss ceswick word and acknowledg their
truth but at thi time thei did not convinc her
i would give anyth to be like your niec she said bluntli and
so would ani other girl ask florenc for instanc
ah my dear you think so now wait till anoth twenti year have
pass over your head and then if you ar both aliv see which of
you is the happier as for florenc of cours she would wish to be
like eva of cours it is pain for her to have to go about with a
girl besid whom she look like a littl dowdi i daresai that she
would have been as glad if eva stop in london as her cousin were
that she left it dear dear i hope thei wont quarrel florenc
temper is dread when she quarrel
thi wa a remark that dorothi could not gainsai she knew veri well
what florenc temper wa like
but mr jeremi went on the old ladi all thi must be stupid talk
for you to listen to tell me have you been row ani more race
late
no said jeremi i strain a muscl in my arm in the varsiti
race and it is not quit well yet
and where is my dear ernest like most women of whatev ag thei
might be miss ceswick ador ernest
he is come back on mondai week
o then he will be in time for the smyth lawn tenni parti i hear
that thei ar go to give a danc after it do you danc mr
jeremi
jeremi had to confess that he did not inde as a matter of fact no
earthli power had ever been abl to drag him insid a ballroom in hi
life
that is a piti there ar so few young men in these part florenc
count them up the other dai and the proport is on unmarri
man between the ag of twenti and fortyf to everi nine women
between eighteen and thirti
then onli on girl in everi nine can get marri put in dorothi
whose mind had a trick of follow thing to their conclus
and what becom of the other eight ask jeremi
i suppos that thei all grow into old maid like myself answer
miss ceswick
dorothi again follow the matter to it conclus reflect that
in fifteen year or so there would at the present rate of
progress be at least twentyf old maid within a radiu of
three mile from kesterwick much oppress by thi thought she rose
to take her leav
i know who wont be left without a husband unless men ar greater
stupid than i take them foreh jeremi said the kindli old ladi
give dorothi a kiss
if you mean me answer dorothi bluntli with a slightli
heighten colour i am not so vain as to think that anybodi would
care for an unders creatur whose onli accomplish is
housekeep and i am sure it is not for anybodi that i should care
either
ah my dear there ar still a few men of sens in the world who
would rather get a good woman as companion than a pretti face
goodby my dear
though jeremi wa on thi occas disappoint of see eva on the
follow morn he wa so fortun as to meet her and her sister
walk on the beach but when he got into her graciou presenc he

but it wa done and who can recal a kiss
he saw the oliv face grow pale and for a moment she rais her arm

chapter viii
a garden idyl
ernest did not sleep well that night the scene of the even haunt
hi dream and he awok with a sens of oppress that follow
imparti on the heel of misfortun folli and lobstersalad nor
did the broad light of the summer dai dispers hi sorrow inde it
onli serv to defin them more clearli ernest wa a veri
inexperienc youth but inexperienc as he wa he could not but
recognis that he had let himself in for an awkward busi he wa
not in the smallest degre in love with florenc ceswick inde hi
predomin feel toward her wa on of fear she wa as he had
said so terribl in earnest in short though she wa bare a year
older than himself she wa a woman possess of a strength of purpos
and a rigid of will that few of her sex ever attain to at ani
period of their live thi he had guess long ago but what he had
not guess wa that all the tide of her life set so strongli toward
himself
that unlucki kiss as it were had shot the bolt of the sluiceg
and now he wa in a fair wai to be overwhelm by the rush of the
water what cours of action he had best take with her now it wa
beyond hi power to decid he thought of take dorothi into hi
confid and ask her advic but instinct he shrank from
do so then he thought of jeremi onli howev to reject the
idea what would jeremi know of such thing he littl guess that
jeremi wa swell with a secret of hi own of which he wa too shy
to deliv himself it seem to ernest the more he consid the
matter that there wa onli on safe cours for him to follow and
that wa to run awai it would be ignomini it is true but at ani
rate florenc could not run after him he had made arrang to
meet a friend and go for a tour with him in franc toward the end of
the month of august or about five week from the present date these
arrang he now determin to modifi he would go for hi tour at
onc
partial comfort by these reflect he dress himself that
even for the danc at the smyth where he wa to meet florenc
who howev he reflect gratefulli could not expect him to kiss
her there the danc wa to follow a lawntenni parti to which
dorothi accompani by jeremi had gone alreadi ernest have for
reason best known to himself declin to go to the lawntenni
prefer to follow them to the danc
when he enter the ballroom at the smyth the first quadril wa
in progress make hi wai up the room ernest soon came upon
florenc ceswick who wa sit with dorothi while in the
background loom jeremi gigant form both the girl appear to
be wait for him for on hi approach florenc by a movement of her
dress and an almost impercept motion of her hand at onc made
room for him on the bench besid her and invit him to sit down he
did so

i thought that our parti wa suffici repres he answer
lame nod toward jeremi and hi sister why ar you not
danc

jeremi said ernest here is florenc sai that you didnt ask
her to danc

no inde put in dorothi it is easi to see that i never saw
anybodi look so miser as you do
or so big said florenc consolingli
jeremi shrank back into hi corner and tri to look smaller hi
sister wa right a danc wa untold miseri to him the quadril had
ceas by now and present the band struck up a waltz which ernest
danc with florenc thei both waltz well and ernest kept go as
much as possibl perhap in order to give no opportun for
convers at ani rate no allus wa made to the event of the
previou even
where ar your aunt and sister florenc he ask as he led her
back to her seat
thei ar come present she answer shortli
the next danc wa a galop and thi he danc with dorothi whose
slim figur look in the white muslin dress she wore more like that
of a child than a grown woman but child or woman her gener
appear wa singularli pleas and attract ernest thought that
he had never seen the quaint pucker littl face with the two
steadi blue ey in it look so attract not that it wa prettyit
wa not but it wa a face with a great deal of thought in it
moreov it wa a face through which the good of it owner seem
to shine like the light through a lamp

she flush with pleasur and answer simpli i am glad you think
so

she sigh as she answer gentli

not make fun of me ah here come miss ceswick and eva
thei had rejoin florenc and jeremi the two ladi were seat
while ernest and jeremi were stand the former in front of them
the latter against the wall behind for thei were gather at the
topmost end of the long room at dorothi announc both the lad
bent forward to look down the room and both the women fix their
ey on ernest face anxious expectantli someth as a crimin
fix hi ey on the foreman of a juri who is about to pronounc
word that will on wai or anoth affect all hi life
i dont see them said ernest carelessli o here thei come by
georg
whatev these two women were look for in hi face thei had found
it and to all appear it pleas them veri littl dorothi
turn pale and lean back with a faint smile of resign she
had expect it that smile seem to sai but the blood flame like a
dangerflag into florenc haughti featuresther wa no resign
there and meanwhil ernest wa stare down the room quit unawar
of the littl comedi that wa go on around him so wa jeremi and
so wa everi other man who wa there to stare
and thi wa what thei were stare at up the centr of the long room
walk or rather swept miss ceswick for even at her advanc ag
she move like a queen and at ani other time her appear would in
itself have been suffici to excit remark but peopl were not
look at miss ceswick but rather at the radiant creatur who
accompani her and whose statur dwarf her tall as she wa eva
ceswickfor it wa shewa dress in white soie de chin in the
bosom of which wa fix a singl rose the dress wa cut low and her
splendid neck and arm were entir without ornament in the mass
of dark hair which wa coil like a coronet round her head their
glisten a diamond star simpl as wa her costum there wa a
grandeur about it that struck the whole room but in truth it sprang
from the almost perfect beauti of the woman who wore it ani dress
would have look beauti upon that nobl form that tower so
high and yet seem to float up the room with the grace of a swan and
swai like a willow in the wind but her loveli did not end there
from those dark ey there shone a light that few men could look upon
and forget and yet there wa noth bold about it it wa like the
light of a star
on she came her lip halfpart seemingli unconsci of the
admir she wa attract eclips all other women as she
pass and make their beauti that befor had seem bright enough
look poor and mean besid her own it took but a few second ten
perhap for her to walk up the room and yet to ernest it seem long
befor her ey met hi own and someth pass from them into hi
heart that remain there all hi life
hi gaze made her blush a littl it wa so unmistak she guess
who he wa and pass him with a littl inclin of her head
well here we ar at last she said address her sister in her
pure music voic what do you think someth went wrong with the
wheel of the fly and we had to stop to get it mend
inde answer florenc i thought that perhap you came late in
order to make a more effect entri
florenc said her aunt reprovingli you should not sai such
thing
florenc did not answer but put her lace handkerchief to her lip she
had bitten it till the blood ran
by thi time ernest had recov himself he saw sever young
fellow bear down upon them and knew what thei were seek
miss ceswick he said will you introduc me
no sooner said than done and at that moment the band began to plai a
waltz in five second more eva wa float down the room upon hi
arm and the advanc young gentlemen were left lament and if
the truth must be told anathematis that puppi kershaw beneath
their breath
there wa a spirit in her feet she danc divin lightli lean
on hi arm thei swept round the room the incarn of youth
strength and beauti and as thei pass even sour old ladi astleigh
lower her ancient nose an inch or more and deign to ask who wa
that handsom young man danc with the tall girl present thei
halt and ernest observ a more than usual intrepid man come
toward them with the design no doubt of obtain an introduct
and the promis of danc but again he wa equal to the occas
have you a card he ask
o ye
will you allow me to put my name down for anoth danc i think that
our step suit
ye we get on nice here it is
ernest took it the young man had arriv now and wa hover round
and glower ernest nod to him cheerfulli and put hi name
veri much downinde for no less than three danc and an extra
eva open her ey a littl but she said noth their step suit
so veri well
mai i ask you kershaw began hi wouldb rival
o certainli answer ernest benignli i will be with you
present and thei float off again on the rise wave of the
music
when the danc end thei stop just by the spot where miss ceswick
wa sit florenc and dorothi were both danc but jeremi who
did not danc wa stand by her look as sulki as a bear with a
sore head eva stretch out her hand to him with a smile
i hope that you ar go to danc with me mr jone she said
i dont danc he answer curtli and walk awai
she glanc after him wonderingli hi manner wa decidedli rude
i do not think that mr jone is in a good temper she said to
ernest with a smile
o he is a queer fellow go out alwai make him cross he
answer carelessli
then the gather phalanx of wouldb partner march in and took
possess and ernest had to retir
the ball wa draw to it close the dancingroom notwithstand
it open window wa intens hot and mani of the dancer were
stroll in the garden among them ernest and eva thei had just
danc their third waltz in which thei had discov that their
step suit better than ever
florenc dorothi and her brother were also walk all three
togeth it is curiou how peopl in misfortun cling to on anoth
thei walk in silenc thei had noth to sai present thei caught
sight of two tall figur stand by a bush on which wa fix a
dy chines lantern it is sometim unfortun to be tall it
betrai on ident there wa no mistak the two figur though
it wa so dark instinct the three halt and just then the
expir chines lantern did an unkind thing it caught fire and
threw a lurid light upon a veri pretti littl scene ernest wa
bend forward toward eva with all hi soul in hi express ey
and beg for someth she wa blush sweetli and look down
at the rose in her bosom on hand too wa rais as though to
unfasten it the light for a moment wa so strong that dorothi
afterward rememb notic how long eva curl black eyelash
look against her cheek in anoth second it had flare out and the
dark hid the sequel but it mai here be state that when eva
reappear in the ballroom she had lost her rose
charm and idyl as undoubtedli wa thi tableau tr vivant of
youth and beauti obei the primari law of natur and make love
in a garden of eden illumin with chines lantern it did not seem
to pleas ani of the three spectat
jeremi actual forgot the presenc of ladi and went so far as to
swear aloud nor did thei reprov him probabl it gave their feel
some vicari relief
i think we had better be go home it is late said dorothi after
a paus jeremi will you go and order the carriag
jeremi went
florenc said noth but she took her fan in both her hand and bent
it slowli so that the ivori stick snap on by on with a
success of sharp report then she threw it down and set her heel
upon it and ground it into the path there wa someth
inexpress cruel about the wai in which she crush the pretti toi
the action seem to be the appropri and unconsci outcom of
some mental process and it is an odd proof of the excit under
which thei were both labour that at the time the gentlemind
dorothi saw in it noth strang at that moment the two girl were
nearer each other than thei had ever been befor or would ever be
again the common stroke of misfortun for a moment weld their
opposit natur into on at that moment too thei knew that thei
both love the same man befor thei had guess it and had not
like each other the better for it but now that wa forgotten
i think florenc said dorothi with a littl tremor in her voic
that we ar out of the run as jeremi sai your sister is too
beauti for ani woman to stand against her he ha fallen in love
with her
ye said florenc with a bitter laugh and a flash of her brown
ey hi high ha thrown a handkerchief to a new favourit and
she ha lost no time in pick it up we alwai us to call her the
sultana and she laugh again
perhap suggest dorothi she onli mean to flirt with him a
littl i hope that jeremi
jeremi what chanc ha jeremi against him ernest would make more
wai with a woman in two hour than jeremi would in two year we all
love to be taken by storm my dear do not deceiv yourself flirt
with him she will love him wildli in a week who could help love
him she ad with a thrill of her rich voic
dorothi said noth she knew that it wa true and thei walk a few
step in silenc
dorothi do you know what gener happen to favourit and
sultana
no
thei come to a bad end the other ladi of the harem murder them
you know
what do you mean
dont be frighten i dont mean that we should murder my dear
sister what i do mean is that i think we might manag to depos her
will you help me if i find a plan
dorothi better self had had time to assert itself by now the
influenc of the blow wa over and their natur were wide apart
again
no certainli not she answer ernest ha a right to choos for
himself and if your sister get the better of us it is the fortun
of war that is allthough certainli the fight is not quit fair
she ad as she thought of eva radiant loveli
florenc glanc at her contemptu
you have no spirit she said
what do you mean to do
mean to do she answer swing round and face her i mean to

the shill spun in the air
tail howl jeremi
it lit on the beak of the astonish bittern and bound off on to the
floor final roll under a box full of choic specimen of
petrifi bone of antediluvian anim that had been wash out of
the cliff the box wa lug out of the wai with difficulti and the
shill disclos
head it is said ernest exultingli
i expect as much just my luck well shake hand ernest we wont
quarrel about the girl pleas god
thei shook hand heartili enough and part but from that time for
mani a long dai there wa an invis someth between them that had
not been there befor strong inde must be the friendship of which
the bond do not slacken when the shadow of a woman love fall upon
it
that afternoon dorothi said that she want to go into kesterwick to
make some purchas and ernest offer to accompani her thei walk
in silenc as far as titheburgh abbei inde thei both suffer from
a curiou constraint that seem effectu to check their usual
brotherandsisterlik relat ernest wa just begin to feel
the silenc awkward when dorothi stop
what wa that she said i thought i heard somebodi cry out
thei listen and present both heard a woman voic call for
help the sound seem to come from the cliff on their left thei
step to the edg and look over as mai be rememb some twenti
feet from the top of the cliff and fifti or more from the bottom
there wa at thi spot a sandi ledg on which were deposit mani of
the remain wash out of the churchyard by the sea now thi
particular spot wa almost inaccess without ladder becaus
although it wa easi enough to get down to it level the cliff bulg
out on either side of it and gave for the space of some yard littl
or no hold for the hand or feet of the climber
the first thing that caught ernest ey when he look over wa a
ladi foot and ankl which appear to be rest on a tini piec of
rock that project from the surfac of the cliff the next wa the
implor face of eva ceswick who wa sprawl in a most undignifi
posit on the bulg of sandston with noth more between her and
etern than the veri unsatisfactori and insuffici knob of rock
it wa evid that she could move neither on wai or the other
without be precipit to the bottom of the cliff to which she
wa appar cling by suction like a fly
great god exclaim ernest hold on i will come to you
i cant hold much longer
it wa on thing to sai that he would come and anoth to do it the
sand gave scarc ani foothold how wa he to get enough purchas to
pull eva round the bulg he look at dorothi in despair her quick
mind had taken in the situat at a glanc
you must get down there abov her ernest and lie flat and stretch
out your hand to her
but there is noth to hold to when she put her weight on to my
hand we shall both go togeth
no i will hold your leg be quick she is get exhaust
it took ernest but two second to reach the spot that dorothi had
point to and to lai himself flat or rather slant for hi
heel were a great deal higher than hi head fortun he
discov a hard knob of sandston against which he could rest hi
left hand meanwhil dorothi seat herself as secur as she
could abov seiz him by the ankl then ernest stretch hi hand
downward and grip eva by the wrist began to put out hi
strength had the three found ani time to indulg their sens of
humour thei might have found the appear thei present intens
ludicr but thei did not for the veri good reason that for thirti
second or so their live were not worth a farth purchas ernest
strain and strain but eva wa a larg woman although she danc
so lightli and the bulg over which he had to pull her wa almost
perpendicular present he felt that dorothi wa begin to slip
abov him
she must make an effort or we shall all go she said in a quiet
voic
drive your knee into the sand and throw yourself forward it is your
onli chanc gasp ernest to the exhaust girl beneath him
she realis the mean of hi word and gave a desper struggl
pull doll for god sake pull she come
then follow a second of despair effort and she wa besid him on
the spot where he lai anoth struggl and the three sank exhaust
on the top of the cliff rescu from a most immin death
by jove ejacul ernest that wa a near thing
dorothi nod she wa too exhaust to speak eva smile and
faint
he turn to her with a littl cry and began to chafe her cold hand
oh she dead doll he said
no she ha faint give me your hat
befor he could do so she had seiz it and wa run as quickli as
her exhaust would allow toward a spring that bubbl up a hundr
yard awai and which onc had been the water suppli of the old abbei
ernest went on rub for a minut or more but without produc the
slightest effect he wa in despair the beauti face beneath him
look so wan and deathlik all the red had left her lip in hi
distress and scarc know what he did he bent over them and
kiss them onc twice thrice that mode of restor is not
recommend in the medicin chest guid but in thi instanc it wa
not without it effect present a faint and tremul glow diffus
itself over the pale cheek in anoth moment it deepen to a most
unmistak blush wa it a halfconsci of ernest new
method of treatment or mere the return blood that produc the
blush let us not inquir next eva sigh open her ey and sat
up
oh you ar not dead
no i dont think so but i cant quit rememb what wa it ah i
know and she shut her ey as though to keep out some horrid sight
present she open them again you have save my life she said
if it had not been for you i should have now been ly crush at
the foot of that dread cliff i am so grate
at that moment dorothi came back with a littl water in ernest black
hat for in her hurri she had spill most of it
here drink some of thi she said
eva tri to do so but a billycock hat is not a veri conveni
drink vessel till you get us to it and she upset more than she
swallow but what she drank did her good she put down the hat and
thei all three laugh a littl it wa so funni drink out of an
old hat
were you long down there befor we came ask dorothi
no not long onli about half a minut on that dread bulg
what on earth did you go there for said ernest put hi
drip hat on to hi head for the sun wa hot
i want to see the bone i am veri activ and thought that i could
get up quit safe but sand is so slipperi oh i forgot look
here and she point to a thin cord that wa ti to her wrist
what is that
why it is ti to such an odd lead box that i found in the sand mr
jone said the other dai that he thought it wa a bit of an old
coffin but it is not it is a lead box with a rusti iron handl i
could not move it much but i had thi bit of cord with mei thought
i might want it get down you knowso i ti on end of it to the
handl
let us pull it up said ernest unfasten the cord from eva
wrist and begin to tug
but the case wa too heavi for him to lift alon inde it prove as
much as thei could all three manag to drag it to the top howev up
it came at last ernest examin it carefulli and came to the
conclus that it wa veri ancient the massiv iron handl at the
top of the oblong case wa almost eaten through with rust and the
lead itself wa much corrod although from fragment that still
clung to it it wa evid that it had onc been protect by an
outer case of oak evid the case had been wash out of the
churchyard where it had lain for centuri
thi is quit excit said eva who wa now suffici
interest to forget all about her escap what can be in
ittreasur or paper i should think
i dont know answer ernest i should hardli think that thei
would buri such thing in a churchyard perhap it is a small babi
ernest broke in dorothi in an agit wai i dont like that
thing i cant tell you why but i am sure it is unlucki i wish that
you would throw it back to where it came from or into the sea it is
a horrid thing and we have nearli lost our live over it alreadi
nonsens doll whoever thought that you were so superstiti why
perhap it is full of monei or jewel let take it home and open
it
i am not superstiti and you can take it home if you like i will
not touch it i tell you it is a horrid thing
all right doll then you shant have a share of the spoil miss
ceswick and i will divid it will you help me to carri it to the
hous miss ceswickthat is unless you ar afraid of it like
doll
oh no she answer i am not afraid i am dy of curios to
see what is insid
chapter x
what eva found
you ar sure you ar not too tire said ernest after a moment
consider
no inde i have quit recov she answer with a blush
ernest blush too from sympathi probabl and went to pick up a
bough that lai beneath a stunt oaktre which grew in the ruin of
the abbei on the spot where onc the altar had stood thi he ran
through the iron handl and direct eva to take hold of on end
he took the other himself dorothi march solemnli in front
as it happen jeremi and mr cardu were stroll along togeth
smoke when suddenli thei caught sight of the cavalcad advanc
and hurri to meet it
what is all thi ask mr cardu of dorothi who wa now nearli
fifti yard ahead of the other two
well reginald it is a long stori first we found eva ceswick
slip down the cliff and drag her up just in time
my luck again thought jeremi groan in spirit i might have sat
on the edg of that cliff for ten year and never got a chanc of
drag her up
then we pull up that horrid box which she found down in the sand
and ti a cord to
ye exclaim ernest who wa now arriv and would you believ
it dorothi want us to throw it back again
i know i did i said that it wa unlucki and it is unlucki
nonsens dorothi it is veri interest i expect that it will be
found to contain deed buri in the churchyard for safeti and never
dug up again broke in mr cardu much interest let me catch
hold of that stick miss ceswick and i daresai that jeremi will go on
and get a hammer and a cold chisel and we will soon solv the
mysteri
oh veri well reginald you will see said dorothi
mr cardu glanc at her it wa curiou her take such an idea
then thei walk to the hous on reach the sittingroom thei found
jeremi alreadi there with hi hammer and chisel he wa an admir
amateur blacksmith inde there were few manual trade of which he
did not know a littl and place the case on the tabl he set
about the task of open it in a most workmanlik manner
the lead though it wa in place eaten quit awai wa still thick
and sound near the edg and it took him a good quarter of an hour
hard chop to remov what appear to be the front of the case
excit wa at it height as it fell forward with a bang on the
tabl but it wa then found that what had been remov wa mere a
portion of an outer case there be beneath it an inner chest also
of lead
well said jeremi thei fasten it up pretti well and then he
set to work again
thi inner skin of lead wa thinner and easier to cut than the first
had been and he got through the job more quickli though not nearli
quickli enough for the impati of the bystand at last the front
fell out and disclos a small cabinet made of solid piec of black
oak and have a hing door which wa fasten by a tini latch and
hasp of the common pattern that is probabl as old as door ar from
thi cabinet there came a strong odour of spice
the excit wa now intens and seem to be share by everybodi
in the hous grice had come in through the swingdoor and station
herself in the background sampson and the groom were peer through
the window and even old atterleigh attract by the sound of the
hammer had stroll aimlessli in
what can it be said eva with a gasp
slowli jeremi extract the cabinet from it leaden cover and set
it on the tabl
shall i open it he said suit the action to the word he lift
the latch and place the chisel between the edg of the littl door
and it frame prise the cabinet open
the smell of spice becam even more pronounc than ever and for a
moment the cloud of dust that came from them as their fragment
roll out of the cabinet on to the tabl prevent the spectat
who all but dorothi were crowd up to the case from see what
it contain present howev a larg whitish bundl becam
visibl jeremi put in hi hand pull it out and laid it on the top
of the box it wa heavi but when he had done thi he did not seem
inclin to go ani further in the matter the bundl had he
consid an uncanni look
at that moment an interrupt took place for florenc ceswick
enter through the open door she had come up to see dorothi and wa
astonish to find such a gather
why what is it all about she ask
somebodi told her in as few word as possibl for everybodi
attent wa concentr on the bundl which nobodi seem inclin
to touch
well why dont you open it ask florenc
i think that thei ar all afraid said mr cardu with a laugh
he wa watch the variou express on the face with an amus
air
well i am not afraid at ani rate said florenc now ladi and
gentlemen the gorgon head is about to be unveil look the other
wai or you will all be turn to stone
thi is get delightfulli ghastli said eva to ernest
i know that it will be someth horrid ad dorothi
meanwhil florenc had drawn out a heavi pin of ancient make with
which the wrap of the bundl wa fasten and began to unwind a
long piec of discolour linen at the first turn anoth shower of
spice fell out as soon as these had been swept asid florenc
proceed slowli with her task and as she remov fold after fold of
the linen the bundl began to take shape and form and the shape it
took wa that of a human head
eva saw it and drew closer to ernest jeremi saw it and felt inclin
to bolt dorothi saw it and knew that her presenti as to the
disagre natur of the content of that unlucki case were come
true mr cardu saw it and wa more interest than ever onli
florenc and hardrid atterleigh saw noth anoth turn or two
of the long windingsheet and it slip suddenli awai from whatev
it enclos
there wa a moment dead silenc as the compani regard the object
thu left open to their gaze then on of the women gave a low cry of
fear and actuat by some common impuls thei all turn and broke
from the room in terror and call it is aliv no not all
florenc turn pale but she stood there by the object the
windingsheet in her hand and old atterleigh also remain stare
at it either paralys or fascin
it too seem to stare at him from it point of vantag on the oak
chest in which it had rest for so mani centuri
and thi wa what he saw there upon the box let the reader imagin
the face and head of a love woman of some thirti year of ag the
latter cover with rippl brown lock of great length abov which
wa set a roughli fashion coronet stud with uncut gem let him
imagin thi face all but the lip which were colour red pale
with the bloodless pallor of death and the flesh so firm and
freshlook that it might have been that of a corps not a dai old
so firm inde that the head and all it pendant weight of beauti
hair could stand on the unshrunken base of the neck which in some
farpast ag cold steel had made so smooth then let him imagin the
crown horror of thi weird sight the ey of a corps ar shut
but the ey in thi head were wide open and the long black lash
as perfect now as on the dai of death hung over what when the light
struck them appear to be two ball of trembl fire that
glitter and roll and fix themselv upon the face of the
observ like live human ey it wa these aw ey that carri
such terror to the heart of the onlook when thei cast their first
glanc around and made them not unnatur cry out that the head wa
aliv
it wa not until he had made a veri care examin of these fieri
orb that mr cardu wa afterward abl to discov what thei were
and as the reader mai as well understand at onc that thi head had
noth about it differ from ani other skilfulli preserv head he
shall be taken into confid without delai thei were ball of
crystal fit probabl by the aid of slender spring into the
eyesocket with such infern art that thei shook and trembl to the
slightest sound and even on occas roll about the head itself
he also discov had not been embalm in the ordinari wai by
extract the brain and fill the caviti with spice of bitumen
but had been preserv by mean of the inject of silica or some
kindr substanc into the brain vein and arteri which after
permeat all the flesh had solidifi and made it like marbl some
brilliant pigment had been us to give the lip their natur colour
and the hair had been preserv by mean of the spice but perhap
the most dread thing about thi relic of forgotten ag wa the
mock smile that the artist who set it up had manag to preserv
upon the facea smile that just drew the lip up enough to show the
white teeth beneath and gave the idea that it wearer had di in the
full enjoy of some malici jest or triumph it wa a terribl
thing to look on that longdead beauti face with it abund
hair it crown coronet it move crystal ey and it smile
yet there wa someth awfulli fascin about it those who had
seen it onc would alwai long to see it again
mr cardu had fled with the rest but as soon as he got outsid the
swingdoor hi common sens reassert itself and he stop
come come he call to the other dont be so silli you ar not
go to run awai from a dead woman head ar you
you ran too said dorothi pull up and gasp
ye i know i did those ey startl me but of cours thei ar
glass i am go back it is a great curios
it is an accurs thing mutter dorothi
mr cardu turn and reenter the room and the other comfort
themselv with the reflect that it wa broad daylight and drawn
by their devour curios follow him that is thei all follow
him except grice who wa ill for two dai afterward as for sampson
and the groom who had seen the sight through the window thei ran for
a mile or more along the cliff befor thei stop
when thei got back into the room thei found old atterleigh still
stand and stare at the crystal ey that seem to be return
hi gaze with compound interest while florenc wa there with the
long linen wrapper in her hand gaze down at the beauti hair that
flow from the head on to the oak box from the box to the tabl and
from the tabl nearli to the ground it wa oddli enough of the same
colour and textur as her own she had taken off her hat when she
began to undo the wrap and thei all notic the fact nor did
the resembl stop there the sharp fine featur of the mummi
head were veri like florenc so were the beauti teeth and the
fix hard smile the dead face wa more love inde but otherwis
the woman of the saxon erafor to judg from the rude tiara on her
brow it is probabl that she wa saxonand the live girl of the
nineteenth centuri might have been sister or mother and daughter
the resembl startl them all as thei enter the room but thei
said noth
thei drew near and gaze again without a word dorothi wa the first
to break the silenc
i think she must have been a witch she said i hope that you will
have it thrown awai reginald for she will bring us bad luck the
place where she ha been buri ha been unlucki it wa a great abbei
onc now it is a desert ruin when we tri to get the case up we
were all veri nearli kill she will bring us bad luck i am sure of
it throw it awai reginald throw her into the sea look she is just
like florenc there
florenc had smile at dorothi word and the resembl becam
more strike than ever eva shudder as she notic it
nonsens dorothi said mr cardu who wa a bit of an antiquarian
and had now forgotten hi start in hi collector zeal it is a
splendid find but i forgot he ad in a tone of disappoint
it doe not belong to me it belong to miss ceswick
o i am sure you ar welcom to it so far as i am concern said
eva hastili i would not have it near me on ani account
o veri well i am much oblig to you i shall valu the relic veri
much
florenc had meanwhil move round the tabl and wa gaze earnestli
into the crystal ey
what ar you do florenc ask ernest sharpli for the scene
wa uncanni and jar upon him
i she answer with a littl laugh i am seek an inspir
that face look wise it mai teach me someth besid it is so
like my own i think she must be some fardist ancestress
so she had notic it too thought ernest
put her back in the box jeremi said mr cardu i must have an
airtight case made
i can do that said jeremi by line the old on with lead and
put a glass front to it
jeremi set about put the head awai touch it veri gingerli
when he got it back into the oak case he dust it and place it
upon a bracket that jut from the oakpanel at the end of the
room
well said florenc now that you have put your guardian angel on
her pedest i think that we must be go home will ani of you walk
a littl wai with us
dorothi said that thei would all comethat is all except mr cardu
who had gone back to hi offic accordingli thei start and as thei
did so florenc intim to ernest that she wish to speak to him
he wa alarm and disappoint for he wa afraid of florenc and
wish to walk with eva and presum hi face betrai what wa in
hi mind to her
do not be frighten she said with a slight smile i am not go
to sai anyth disagre
of cours he repli that he knew that she never could sai anyth
disagre at ani time at which she smile again the same faint
smile and thei drop behind
ernest she said present i want to speak to you you rememb
what happen between us two even ago on thi veri beach for

he did not understand her in the least but he nod hi head
feel vagu that thing were turn out veri well for him
she look at him and went on
so here in the same place where i said them i renounc them we
will forget all that foolish scene ernest i wa in error when i told

in due cours jeremi duli fit up the witch as the mysteri
head came to be call at dum ness in her airtight cabinet which
he lengthen till it look like a clockcas in order to allow the
beauti hair to hang down at full length retain howev the
origin door and ancient latch and hasp hi next step wa to fit the
plateglass front and exhaust the air as well as wa feasibl from
the interior of the case then he screw on the outsid door and
stood it back on it bracket in the oakpanel sittingroom where
as ha been said it look for all the world like an eightdai
clockcas
just as he had finish the job a visitorit wa mr de talorcam
in and remark that he had made a preciou ugli clock jeremi who
dislik the de talor as he call him excess said that he
would not sai so when he had seen the work and at the same time
unhasp the oak door of the cabinet and turn the full glare of the
dread crystal ey on to hi face the result were startl for
a moment de talor stare and gasp then all the rich hue fade from
hi featur and he sank back in a sort of fit jeremi shut up the
door in a hurri and hi visitor soon recov but for year noth
would induc him to enter that room again
as for jeremi himself at first he wa dreadfulli afraid of the
witch but as time went onfor hi job took him sever daysh
seem to lose hi aw of her and even to find a fear joi in her
societi he spent whole hour as he sat in hi workshop in the yard
tinker at the airtight case in weav histori in which thi
beauti creatur whose head had been thu marvel recov
plai the leadingpart it wa so strang to look at her love
scorn face and think that long ag sinc men had love it and
kiss it and plai with the wave hair
there it wa thi relic of the dead preserv by the consumm
skill of some old monk or chemist so that it retain all it ancient
beauti long after the echo of the tragedi with which it must have
been connect had di out of the world for as he wrought at the
case jeremi grew certain that here wa the ghastli memento of some
enorm crime inde by degre as he tack and hammer at the
lead line he made up a histori that wa quit satisfactori to hi
mind appeal on doubt point to the witch herself who wa on
the tabl near him and ascertain whether she meant ye or no
by the simpl process of observ whether or not her ey trembl
when he spoke it wa slow work get the stori togeth in thi
fashion but then the manufactur of the case wa slow also and it
wa not without it charm for he felt it an honour to be taken into
the confid of so love a ladi
but if the head had a fascin for jeremi it had a still greater
charm for hi grandfath the old man would continu slip out of
the offic and cross the yard to the littl room where jeremi work
in order to stare at thi wonder relic on night inde when the
case wa nearli finish jeremi rememb that he had not lock the
door of hi workshop he wa alreadi half undress but slip on
hi coat again he went out by the back door and cross the yard
carri the kei with him it wa bright moonlight and jeremi have
slipper on walk without nois when he reach the workshop and
wa about to lock the door he thought he heard a sound in the room
thi startl him and for a moment he medit retreat leav the
head to look after itself those ey were interest in the daytim
but he scarc care to face them alon at night it wa foolish but
thei did look so veri much aliv
after a moment hesit dure which the sound whatev it wa
again made itself audibl he determin to compromis matter by
go round to the other side of the room and look in at the littl
window with a beat heart he stole round and quietli peer in
the moonlight wa shine bright into the room and struck full upon
the long case he had manufactur he had left it shut and the head
insid it now it wa open he could clearli see the white outlin of
the trembl ey the sound tooa mutter soundwa still go
on jeremi drew back and wipe the perspir from hi forehead
and for the second time thought of flight but hi curios overcam
him and he look again thi time he discov the caus of the
mutter
seat upon hi carpent bench wa hi grandfath old atterleigh
who appear to be stare with all hi might at the head and talk
incoher to himself thi wa the nois he had heard through the
door it wa an uncanni sight and made jeremi feel cold down the
back while he wa still contempl it and wonder what to do
old atterleigh rose close the case and left the room jeremi
slip round lock up the door and made hi wai back to bed much
astonish he did not howev sai anyth of what he had seen
onli in futur he wa care never to leav the door of hi workshop
open
at last the case wa finish and for an amateur a veri good job it
look when it wa done he place it as alreadi narrat back on
the bracket and show it to mr de talor
but from the dai when eva ceswick nearli fell to the bottom of the
cliff in the cours of her antiquarian research thing began to go
wrong at dum ness everybodi felt it except ernest and he wa
think too much of other thing dorothi wa veri unhappi in those
dai and began to look thin and miser though she sturdili
alleg when ask that she never felt better in her life jeremi
himself wa also unhappi and for a good reason he had caught the
fever that women like eva ceswick have it in their power to give to
the son of men hi wa a deep selfcontain natur veri gentl and
tender not admit mani thing into it affect but love such
as were admit with all the heart and soul and strength and it wa
in the deepest depth of thi loyal natur that eva ceswick had
print her imag befor he knew it befor he had time to think it
wa photograph there upon hi heart and he felt that there it must
stai for good or evil that plate could never be us again
she had been so kind to him her ey had grown so bright and friendli
when she saw him come he wa sure that she like him which inde
she did and onc he had ventur to press her littl hand and he
had thought that she had return the pressur and had not slept all
night in consequ
but perhap thi wa a mistak and then just as he wa get on so
nice came ernest and scatter hi hope like mist befor the
morn sun from the moment that those two met he knew that it wa
all over with hi chanc next to make assur doubli sure
provid itself in the shape of a shill had declar against
him and he wa left lament well it wa all fair but still it
wa veri hard and for the first time in hi life he felt inclin to
be angri with ernest inde he wa angri and the fact made him more
unhappi than ever becaus he knew that hi anger wa unjust and
becaus hi brotherli love condemn it
but for all that the shadow between them grew darker
mr cardu too had hi troubl connect needless to sayfor
noth els ever realli troubl himwith hi monomania of reveng
mr de talor of whose discomfitur he had at last made sure had
unexpectedli slip out of hi power nor could he at present see ani
wai in which to draw him back again consequ he wa distress
as for hardrid atterleigh ever sinc he had found himself fix
by the witch crystal ey he had been madder than ever and more
perfectli convinc that mr cardu wa the devil in person inde
dorothi who watch over the old man the grandfath who never knew
her thought that she observ a mark chang in him he work awai
at hi write as usual but it appear to her with more vigour as
though it were a thing to encount and get rid of he would cut the
notch out of hi stick calendar too more eagerli than heretofor
and altogeth it seem as though hi life had becom domin by
some new purpos she call mr carduss attent to thi chang
but he laugh and said that it wa noth and would probabl soon
pass with the moon
but if nobodi els wa happi ernest wasthat is except when he wa
sunk in the depth of woe which wa on an averag about three dai
a week on the occas of these seizur dorothi note hi
miser aspect and entir want of appetit felt much alarm and
took an occas after supper to ask him what wa the matter befor
mani minut were over she had caus to regret it for ernest burst
forth with a histori of hi love and hi wrong that last for an
hour it appear that anoth young gentleman on of those who
danc with the love eva at the smyth ball had been make the
most unmistak advanc he had calledthre time he had sent
flowerstwic ernest sent them everi morn beguil sampson into
cut the best orchidbloom for that purpos he had been out
walkingonc dorothi listen quietli till he ceas of hi own
accord then she spoke
so you realli love her ernest
love her ibut we will not enter into a descript of thi young
man raptur when he had done dorothi did a curiou thing she
rose from her chair and come to where ernest wa sit bent over
him and kiss him on the forehead as she did so he notic vagu
that she had great black ring round her ey
i hope that you will be happi my dear brother you will have a
love wife and i think that she is as good as she is beauti she
spoke quietli but somehow her voic sound like a sob he kiss her
in acknowledg and she glide awai
ernest did not think much of the incid howev inde in five
minut hi thought were back with eva with whom he wa serious
and earnestli in love in sober truth the antic that he plai were
enough to make the angel weep to see a human be possess the
normal weight of brain make such a donkei of himself for instanc
he would promenad for hour at night in the neighbourhood of the
cottag onc he ventur into the garden to enjoi the perfect bliss
of stare at six pane of glass got sever bitten by the housedog
for hi pain and wa final chase for a mile or more by both the
dog and the policeman who have heard of the mysteri figur that
wa to be seen moon in everi sens of the word round the cottag
had laid up to watch for him next dai he had the satisfact of
hear from hi ador own lip the stori of the attempt
burglari but as she told it there wa a smile plai about the
corner of her mouth which almost seem to indic that she had her
suspicion as to who the burglar wa but then ernest walk so veri
lame which consid that the teeth of a brute call towzer had
made a big hole in hi calf wa not to be wonder at
after thi he wa oblig to give up hi midnight sigh but he took
it out in other wai onc inde without warn he flop down on
to the floor and kiss eva hand and then aghast at hi own
bold fled from the room
at first all thi amus eva greatli she wa pleas at her conquest
and took a malici pleasur in lead ernest on when she knew that
he wa come she would make herself as love as possibl and put on
all her charm littl wai and grace in order more thoroughli to
enslav him somehow whenev ernest thought of her in after year as
she wa at that period of her life hi memori would call up a vision
of her in a pretti littl drawingroom at the cottag lean back in
a low chair in such a wai as to contriv to show off her splendid
figur to the best advantag also the tini foot and slender ankl
that peep from beneath her soft white dress there she sat a littl
skyeterri call tail on her lap with which hi rival had
present her but a fortnight befor andyesactu kiss the
brute at interv her ey shine all the time with innoc
coquetri what would not ernest have given to occupi for a singl
minut the posit of that unappreci skyeterri it wa agoni
to see so mani kiss wast on a dog and eva awar that he thought
so kiss the anim more vigor than ever
at last he could stand it no longer put that dog down he said
peremptorili
she obei him then rememb that he had no right to dictat to
her what she should do made an effort to pick it up again but
tail who be it ad wa not us to be kiss in privat
life and thought the whole oper rather a bore promptli bolt
why should i put the dog down she ask with a quick look of
defianc
becaus i hate see you kiss it it is so effemin
he spoke in a master wai it wa a touch of the curb and there ar
few thing a proud woman resent so much as the first touch of the
curb
what right have you to dictat what i shall or shall not do she
ask tap her foot upon the floor
ernest wa veri humbl in those dai and he collaps
none at all dont be angri eva it wa the first time he had
call her so till now she had alwai been miss ceswick but the
fact wa i could not bear to see you kiss that dog i wa jealou
of the brute
whereupon she blush furious and chang the subject still after a
while eva coquettish began to be less and less mark when thei
met she no longer greet him with a smile of mischief but with
seriou ey that onc or twice he thought bore trace of tear at
the same time she threw him into despair by her cold did he
ventur a tender remark she would pretend not to hear itala that
the mount blood should so obstin proclaim that she did did he
touch her hand it wa cold and unrespons she wa quieter too
and her reserv frighten him onc he tri to break it and began
some passion appeal but she rose without answer and turn her
face to the window he follow her and saw that her dark ey were
full of tear thi he felt wa even more aw than her cold
and fear that he had offend her he obei her whisper
entreati and went poor boi he wa veri young had he had a littl
more experi he might have found mean to brush awai her tear and
hi own doubt it is a melancholi thing that such opportun
should as a rule present themselv befor peopl ar old or
experienc enough to take advantag of them
the secret of all thi chang of conduct wa not far to seek eva had
toi with edg tool till she cut her finger to the bone the
darkei boi who danc so well and had such a handsom happi face
had becom veri dear to her she had begun by plai with him and
now ala she love him better than anybodi in the world that wa
the sting of the thing she had fallen in love with a boi as young
as herselfa boi too who so far as she wa awar had no
particular prospect in life it wa humili to her pride to think
that she who in the few month that she had been out in london
befor her cousin rose up and cast her forth had alreadi found the
satisfact of see on or two men of middl ag and establish
posit at her feet and the further satisfact of request them
to kneel there no more should in the upshot have to strike her
colour to a boi of twentyon even though he did stand six feet
high and had more wit in hi young head and more love in hi young
heart than all her middleag admir put togeth
perhap though she wa a woman grown she wa not herself quit old
enough to appreci the great advantag it is to ani girl to stamp
her imag upon the heart of the man she love while the wax is yet
soft and undefac by the half wornout mark of mani shallow di
perhap she did not know what a bless it is to be abl realli to
love a man at all young middleag or old mani women wait till
thei cannot love without shame to make that discoveri perhap she
forgot that ernest youth wa a fault which would mend dai by dai
and that he had abil which if she would consent to inspir them
might lead him to great thing at ani rate two fact remain in her
mind after much think she love him with all her heart and of it
she wa asham
but as yet she could not make up her mind to ani fix cours it
would have been easi to crush poor ernest to tell him that hi
pretens were ridicul to send him awai or to go awai herself
and so to make an end of a posit that she felt wa grow absurd
and which we mai be sure her elder sister florenc did noth to make
more pleasant but she could not do it that wa the long and the
short of the matter the idea of live without ernest made her feel
cold all over it seem to her that the onli hour that she realli
did live were the hour which thei spent togeth and that when he
went awai he took her heart with him no she could not make up her
mind to that the thought wa too cruel then there wa the other
altern to encourag him a littl and becom engag to him to
brave everyth for hi sake but as yet she could not make up her
mind to that either
eva ceswick wa veri love veri sweet and veri good but she did not
possess a determin mind
chapter xii
deeper yet
while ernest wa woo and eva doubt time whose interest in
earthli affair is that of the sickl in the grow crop went on hi
wai as usual
the end of august came as it ha come so mani thousand time sinc
thi globe gave it first turn in space as it will come for mani
thousand time more till at last it appoint cours run out the
world darken quiver and grow still and behold ernest wa still
woo eva still doubt
on eveningit wa a veri beauti eveningthi pair were walk
togeth on the seashor whether thei met by appoint or by
accid doe not matter thei did meet and there thei were
stroll along togeth as fulli charg with intens feel as a
thundercloud with electr and almost as quiet the storm had not
yet burst
to listen to the talk of these two thei might have met for the first
time yesterdai it wa chiefli about the weather
present in the cours of their wander thei came to a littl
sailingboat drawn up upon the beachnot far up howev just out of
the reach of the wave by thi boat in an attitud of intens
contempl there stood an ancient marin hi hand were in hi
pocket hi pipe wa in hi mouth hi ey were fix upon the deep
appar he did not notic their approach till thei were within two
yard of him then he turn dash himself and ask the ladi
with a pull of hi grizzl forelock if she would not take a sail
ernest look surpris
how the wind he ask
straight on shore sir will turn with the turn of the tide sir and
bring you back
will you come for a bit of a sail eva
o no thank you i must be get home it is seven oclock
there is no hurri for you to get home your aunt and florenc have
gone to tea with the smyth
inde i cannot come i could not think of such a thing
her word were unequivoc but the ancient marin put a strang
interpret upon them first he haul up the littl sail and
then place hi brown hand against the stern of the boat he rest
hi weight upon them and caus her to travel far enough into the
wave to float her bow
now miss
i am not come inde
now miss
i will not come ernest
come said ernest quietli hold out hi hand to help her in
she took it and got in ernest and the marin gave a strong shove
and as the light boat took the water the former leap in and at the
same second a puff of wind caught the sail and took them ten yard
out or more
why the sailor is left behind said eva
ernest gave a twist to the tiller to get the boat head straight off
shore and then leisur look round the marin wa stand as
thei had found him hi hand in hi pocket hi pipe in hi mouth
hi ey fix upon the deep
he doesnt seem to mind it he said medit
ye but i do you must go back and fetch him
thu appeal to ernest went through some violent manoeuvr with the
tiller without produc ani mark effect on the cours of the boat
which by thi time had got out of the shelter of the cliff and wa
bowl along merrili
wait till we get clear of the draught from the cliff and i will
bring her round
but when at last thei were clear from the draught of the cliff and he
slowli got her head round lo and behold the marin had vanish
how unfortun said ernest get her head toward the open sea
again he ha probabl gone to hi tea eva tri hard to get angri
but somehow she could not she onli succeed in laugh
if i thought that you had done thi on purpos i would never come
out with you again
ernest look horrifi on purpos he said and the subject
drop
thei were sit side by side in the sternsheet of the boat and
the sun wa just dip all redhot into the ocean under the lee of
the cliff there were cool shadow befor them wa a path of glori
that led to a golden gate the air wa veri sweet and for those two
all the world wa love there wa no sorrow on the earth there were
no storm upon the sea
eva took off her hat and let the sweet breez plai upon her brow
then she lean over the side and dip her hand into the cool
water watch the littl track it made
eva
ye ernest
do you know i am go awai
the hand wa withdrawn with a start
go awai when
the dai after tomorrow to guernsei first then to franc
and when ar you come back again
i think that depend upon you eva
the hand went back into the water thei were a mile or more from the
shore now ernest manipul the sail and tiller so as to sail slowli
parallel with the coastlin then he spoke again
eva
no answer
eva for god sake look at me
there wa someth in hi voic that forc her to obei she took her
hand out of the water and turn her ey on to hi face it wa pale
and the lip were quiver
i love you he said in a low choke voic
she grew angri why did you bring me here i will go home thi is
nonsens you ar noth but a boi
there ar moment in life when the human face is capabl of convei
a more intens and vivid impress than ani word when it seem to
speak to the veri soul in a languag of it own and so it wa with
ernest now he made no answer to her reproach but if that were
possibl hi featur grew paler yet and hi ey shine like
star fix themselv upon her and drew her to him what thei said
she and he knew alon nor could ani word convei it for the tongu
in which thei talk is not spoken in thi world
a moment still she waver fight against the sweet masteri of hi
will with all her woman strength and theno heaven it wa done
and hi arm were round about her her head upon hi breast and her
voic wa lost in sob and broken word of love
o radiantwing hour of more than mortal joi the heart which you
have touch will know when their time come that thei have not been
quit in vain
and so thei sat those two quit silent for there seem to be no
need for speech word could not convei half thei had to sai inde
to tell the honest truth their lip were for the most part
otherwis emploi
meanwhil the sun went down and the sweet moon aros over the quiet
sea and turn their littl ship to silver eva gentli disengag
herself from hi arm and half rose to look at it she had never
thought it half so beauti befor ernest look at it too it is a
wai that lover have

truli he wa on the horn of a dilemma probabl befor he wa much
older on of them would have pierc him for a moment he wa about
to return to hi uncl and tell him all the truth but on reflect
he could not see what wa to be gain by such a cours at ani rate
it seem to him that he must first consult eva whom he had arrang
to meet on the beach at three oclock there wa nobodi els whom he
could consult for he wa shy of talk about eva to jeremi or dolli
the rest of that morn went veri ill for ernest but three oclock
came at last and found him at the trystingplac
about a mile on the farther side of kesterwick that is two mile or
so from titheburgh abbei the cliff jut out into the sea in a wai
that correspond veri curious with the littl promontori known as
dum ness the reason of it resist to the action of the wave
be that it wa at thi spot compos of an upcrop of rock of a more
durabl natur than the sandston and pebbl of the remaind of the
line of cliff just at the point of thi promontori the wave had worn
a hollow in the rock that wa local dignifi by the name of the
cave for two hour or more at high tide thi hollow wa under water
and it wa therefor imposs to pass the headland except by boat
but dure the rest of the dai it form a conveni grotto or
trystingplac the more so as anybodi sit in it wa quit
invis either from the beach the cliff or inde unless the boat
wa quit close in shore the sea in front
here it wa that ernest had arrang to meet eva and on turn the
rocki corner of the cave he found her sit on a mass of fallen rock
wait for him at the sight of her beauti form he forgot all hi
troubl and when rise to greet him blush like the dawn she
lift her pure face for him to kiss there wa not a happier lad in
england then she made room for him besid herth rock wa just wide
enough for twoand he place hi arm round her waist and for a
minut or two she laid her head upon hi shoulder and thei were veri

captain justic readi answer
then if ani blood is shed on hi head be it said mr alston
solemnli come let us get it over
each took hi man and place him by on of the stick and then hand

stand sidewai and rememb what i told you whisper mr alston
ar you readi gentlemen ask captain justic present
there wa no answer but ernest felt hi heart stand still and a mist
gather befor hi ey at that moment he heard a lark rise into the
air near him and begin to sing unless he could get hi sight back he
felt that he wa lost
on the mist clear awai from hi ey he saw hi adversari
pistolbarrel point steadili at him
two a rai broke from the rise sun and caught a crystal pin
hugh kershaw incauti wore instinct ernest rememb mr
alston advic and lower the sight of hi long barrel till it wa
dead on the crystal pin curious enough it remind him at that
moment of the ey in the witch head at dum ness hi vital forc
rose to the emerg and hi arm grew as steadi as a rock then came
a paus that seem hour long
three there wa a doubl report and ernest becam awar of a
commot in hi hair hugh kershaw flung up hi arm wildli sprang a
few inch off the ground and fell backward great god it wa over
ernest stagger a moment from the reaction and then ran with the
other toward hi cousinnai toward what had been hi cousin he
wa ly on hi back upon the sand hi wideopen ey stare up
at the blue sky as though to trace the flight of the spirit hi arm
extend the heavi revolverbal had struck near the crystal pin and
then pass upward through the throat and out at the base of the
head shatter the spinal column
he is dead said captain justic solemnli
ernest wrung hi hand
i have kill him he saidi have kill my own cousin
young man said mr alston do not stand there wring your hand
but thank provid for your own escap he wa veri near kill
you let me tell you is your head cut
instinct ernest took off hi hat and as he did so some fragment
of hi curli hair fell to the ground there wa a neat hole through
the felt and a neat groov along hi thick hair hi cousin had
meant to kill him and he wa a good shotso good that he thought
that he could put a ball through ernest head but he forgot that a
heavi american revolv with forti grain of powder behind the ball
is apt to throw a trifl high
thei all stood silent and look at the bodi and the lark that had
been frighten by the nois began to sing again
thi will not do said mr alston present we had better move the
bodi in there and he point to the desert hut captain justic
what do you intend to do
give myself up to the author i suppos wa the gallant
captain scare answer
veri well i dont advis you to do that but it you ar determin
to there is no need for you to be in a hurri about it you must give
us time to get clear first
thei lift the corps rever bore it into the desert hut and
laid it on the floor ernest remain stand look at the red
stain where it had been present thei came out again and mr alston
kick some sand over the stain and hid it
now he said we had better make an addit to those document to
sai how thi came about
thei all went back to the hut and the addit wa made stand
there by the bodi when it came to ernest turn to sign he almost
wish that hi signatur wa the on miss from the foot of that
ghastli postscriptum mr alston guess hi thought
the fortun of war he said coolli now captain justic we ar
go to catch the earli boat and we hope that you will not give
yourself up befor middai if you can help it the inquiri into the
affair will not then be held befor tomorrow and by eleven tomorrow
morn i hope to have seen the last of england for some year to
come
the captain wa a good fellow at bottom and had no wish to see other
drag into troubl
i shall certainli give myself up he said but i dont see ani
reason to hurri about it i dont think that thei can do much to me
here poor hugh he can well afford to wait he ad with a sigh
glanc down at the figur that lai so still with a coat thrown over
the face i suppos that thei will lock me up for six
monthspleas prospect but i sai mr kershaw you had better keep
clear it will be more awkward for you you see he wa your cousin
and by hi death you becom unless i am mistaken next heir to the
titl
ye i suppos so said ernest vagu
here it mai be state that captain justic found himself sadli
mistaken instead of the six month he expect he wa arraign for
murder and final sentenc to a term of penal servitud he
receiv a pardon howev after serv about a year of hi time
come we must be off said mr alston or we shall be late for the
boat and bow to captain justic he left the hut
ernest follow hi exampl and when he had gone a few yard
glanc round at the hate spot there stood captain justic in the
doorwai of the hut look much depress and there a few yard to
the left wa the impress in the sand that mark where hi cousin had
fallen he never saw either the man or the place again
kershaw said mr alston what do you propos do
i dont know
but you must think rememb you ar in an awkward fix you know by
english law duell is murder and now i come to think of it i
expect that thi place is subject to the english law in crimin
matter or at least that the law is ident
i think i had better give myself up like captain justic
nonsens you must hide awai somewher for a year or two till the row
blow over
where am i to hide
have you ani monei or can you get ani
ye i have nearli two hundr and fifti pound on me now
my word that is fortun well now what i have to suggest is
that you should assum a fals name and sail for south africa with
me i am go up countri on a shoot expedit outsid british
territori so there will be littl fear of your be caught and
extradit then in a year or so when the affair is forgotten you
can come back to england what do you sai to that
i suppos i mai as well go there as anywher els i shall be a
mark man all my life anyhow what doe it matter where i go
ah you ar down on your luck now byandbi you will cheer up
again
just then thei met a fisherman who gaze at them wonder what the
two gentlemen were do out walk at that hour but conclud
that after the mad fashion of englishmen thei had been to bath he
pass them with a civil bonjour ernest colour to the ey under
the scrutini he wa begin to feel the dread burden of hi
secret present thei reach the steamer and found mr alston
littl boi roger who though he wa onli nine year old wa as quick
and selfreli as mani english lad of fourteen wait for them by
the bridg
oh here you ar father you have been walk so long that i
thought you would miss the boat i have brought the luggag down all
right and thi gentleman too
that right my lad kershaw do you go and take the ticket i want
to get rid of thi and he tap the revolvercas that wa
conceal beneath hi coat
ernest did so and present met mr alston on the boat a few minut
more and to hi intens relief she cast off and stood out to sea
there were not veri mani passeng on board and those there were
were too much taken up in make prepar to be seasick to take
ani notic of ernest yet he could not shake himself free from the
idea that everybodi knew that he had just kill a man hi own
selfconsci wa so intens that he saw hi guilt on the face
of all he met he gaze around him in aw expect everi moment to
be greet as a murder most peopl who have ever done anyth thei
should not ar acquaint with thi sensat
overcom with thi idea he took refug in hi berth nor did he
emerg therefrom till the boat reach weymouth there both he and mr
alston bought some rough cloth and to a great extent succeed in
disguis themselv then made their wai across countri to
southampton in the same train but in separ compart reach

thei took their passag at differ time and feign to be unknown
to each other these precaut thei found to be doubli necessari
inasmuch as at southampton mr alston manag to get hold of a book on
english crimin law from which it appear that the fact of the duel
have been fought in guernsei did not in the least clear them from
the legal consequ of the act as thei had vagu suppos would
be the case on the insuffici author of captain justic

my poor eva
two dai after the pilotboat flit awai from the vessel side
like some silentflight bird had vanish into the night florenc
ceswick happen to be walk past the villag postoffic on her wai
to pai a visit to dorothi when it struck her that the afternoon post

knew that it wa not alwai conveni to mr cardu to send in the
civil old postmast gave her a littl bundl of letter remark at
the same time that he thought that there wa on for the cottag
is it for me mr brown ask florenc

she knew that eva watch the arriv of the post veri carefulli
when she got outsid the offic she glanc at the bundl of letter
in her hand and notic with a start that on of them address to
mr cardu wa in ernest handwrit it bore a southampton
postmark what she wonder could he be do at southampton he

she walk on briskli to dum ness and on her arriv found dorothi
sit work in the sittingroom after she had greet her she
hand over the letter
there is on from ernest she said

mr cardu shook hand with her and thank her for bring the
letter which he turn over casual after the fashion of a man
accustom to receiv larg quantiti of correspond of an
uninterest natur present hi manner quicken and he open
ernest letter florenc fix her keen ey upon him he read the
letter she read hi face
mr cardu wa accustom to conceal hi emot but on thi
occas it wa clear that thei were too strong for him astonish
and grief pursu each other across hi featur as he proceed
final he put the letter down and glanc at an enclosur
what is it reginald what is it ask dorothi
it is answer mr cardu solemnli that ernest is a murder and
a fugit
dorothi sank into a chair with a groan and cover her face with her
hand florenc turn ashi pale
what do you mean she said
read the letter for yourself and see stop read it aloud and the
enclosur too i mai have misunderstood
florenc did so in a quiet voic it wa wonder how her power came
out in contrast to the intens disturb of the other two the old
man of the world shook like a leaf the young girl stood firm as a
rock yet in all probabl her interest in ernest wa more intens
than hi
when she had finish mr cardu spoke again
you see he said i wa right he is a murder and an outcast and
i love the boi i love him well let him go
o ernest ernest sob dorothi
florenc glanc from on to the other with contempt
what ar you talk about she said at last what is there to make
all thi fuss about murder inde then our grandfath were
often murder what would you have had him do would you have had
him give up the woman letter to save himself would you have had him
put up with thi other man insult about hi mother if he had i
would never have spoken to him again stop that groan dorothi you
should be proud of him he behav as a gentleman should if i had the
right i should be proud of him and her breast heav and the proud
lip curl as she said it
mr cardu listen attent and it wa evid that her
enthusiasm move him
there is someth in what florenc sai he broke in i should not
have like the boi to show the white feather but it is an aw
busi to kill on own first cousin especi when on is next
in the entail old kershaw will be furiou at lose hi onli son and
ernest will never be abl to come back to thi countri while he live
or he will set the law on him
it is dread said dorothi just as he wa begin life and
go into a profess and now to have to go and wander in that
faroff countri under a fals name
o ye it is sad enough said mr cardu but what is done cannot
be undon he is young and will live it down and if the worst come
to the worst must make himself a home out there but it is hard upon
me hard upon me and he went to hi offic mutter hard upon
me
when florenc start upon her homeward wai the afternoon had set in
wet and chilli and the sea wa hidden in wreath of grei mist
altogeth the scene wa depress on arriv at the cottag she
found eva stand the pictur of melancholi by the window and
stare out at the misti sea
o florenc i am glad that you have come home i realli began to
feel inclin to commit suicid
inde and mai i ask why
i dont know the rain is so depress i suppos
it doe not depress me
no noth ever doe you live in the land of perpetu calm
i take exercis and keep my liver in good order have you been out
thi afternoon
no
ah i thought not no wonder you feel depress stai indoor all
dai why dont you go for a walk
there is nowher to go
realli eva i dont know what ha come to you late why dont you
go along the cliff or stophav you been to the postoffic i
call for the dum ness letter and mr brown said that there wa
on for you
eva jump up with remark anim and pass out of the room
with her peculiarli light tread the mention of that word letter had
suffic to chang the aspect of thing consider
florenc watch her go with a dark littl smile
ah she said aloud as the door close your feet will soon fall
heavili enough
present eva went out and florenc have thrown off her cloak
took her sister place at the window and wait it wa seven
minut walk to the postoffic she would be back in about a quarter
of an hour watch in hand florenc wait patient seventeen
minut had elaps when the gardeng wa open and eva
reenter her face quit grei with pain and furtiv appli a
handkerchief to her ey florenc smile again
i thought so she said
from all of which it will be seen that florenc wa a veri remark
woman she had scarc exagger when she said that her heart wa
as deep as the sea the love that she bore ernest wa the strongest
thing in all her strong and vigor life when everi other
characterist and influenc crumbl awai and wa forgotten it would
still remain overmast as ever and when she discov that her
high love the greatest and best part of her had been made a
playth of by a thoughtless boi who kiss girl on the same
principl that a duck take to water becaus it came natur to him
the love in it mortal agoni gave birth to a hate destin to grow
as great as itself but with all a woman injustic it wa not
direct toward the same object on ernest inde she would wreak
vengeanc if she could but she still love him as dearli as at first
the reveng would be a mere episod in the histori of her passion but
to her sister the innoc woman who she chose to consid had
rob her she gave all that bounti hate herself the more
power charact of the two she determin upon the utter
destruct of the weaker strong as fate and unrel as time
she dedic her life to that end everyth she said come to
those who can wait she forgot that the provid abov us can wait
the longest of us all in the end it is provid that win
eva came in and florenc heard her make her wai up the stair to her
room again she spoke to herself
the poor fool will weep over him and renounc him if she had the
courag she would follow him and comfort him in hi troubl and so
tie him to her for ever oh that i had her chanc but the chanc
alwai come to fool
then she went upstair and listen outsid eva door she wa
sob audibl turn the handl she walk casual in
well eva did you why my dear girl what is the matter with
you
eva who wa ly sob on her bed turn her head to the wall and
went on sob
what is the matter eva if you onli knew how absurd you look
nononoth
nonsens peopl do not make such a scene as thi for noth
no answer
come my dear as your affection sister i realli must ask what
ha happen to you
the tone wa command and half unconsci eva obei it
ernest she ejacul
well what about ernest he is noth to you is he
nothat is ye o it is so dread it wa the letter and she
touch a sheet of close written paper that lai on the bed besid
her
well as you do not seem to be in a condit to explain yourself
perhap you had better let me read the letter
o no
nonsens give it me perhap i mai be abl to help you and she
took the paper from her unresist grasp and turn her face from
the light read it deliber through
it wa veri passion in it term and rather incoher such a
letter in short as a lad almost wild with love and grief would write
under the circumst
so said florenc as she coolli fold it up it appear that you
ar engag to him
no answer unless sob can be said to constitut on
and it seem that you ar engag to a man who ha just commit a
fright murder and run awai from the consequ
eva sat up on the bed
it wa not a murder it wa a duel
precis a duel about anoth woman but the law call it murder
if he is caught he will be hang
o florenc how can you sai such dread thing
i onli sai what is true poor eva i do not wonder that you ar
distress

about a fortnight after these letter address ernest beyton esq
post offic maritzburg natal had been despatch kesterwick and
it neighbourhood wa thrown into a state of mild excit by the
announc that mr halford the clergyman whose health had of late
been none of the best purpos to take a year rest and that the
bishop had consent to the duti of hi parish be carri on by a
locum tenen name the reverend jame plowden mr halford wa much
like and respect and the intellig wa receiv with gener
regret which wa howev temper with curios as to the
newcom thu when it becam known that mr plowden wa to preach
in the parish church at the even servic on the third sundai in
septemb all kesterwick wa seiz with profound religi fervour
and went to hear him
the parish church at kesterwick wa unusu larg and beauti
be a relic of an ag when whatev men live mai have been thei
spare neither their monei nor their thought in rear up fit
habit to the deiti whom thei regard perhap with more of
superstiti aw than true religi feel stand as it did
somewhat back from the sea it alon had escap the shock of the
devour wave and remain till thi dai a monument of
architectur triumph it tall tower point like a great finger up
to heaven look veri solemn on that quiet septemb even as the
crowd of churchgoer pass beneath it shadow into the old doorwai
through which most of them had been carri to their christen and
would in due time be carri to their burial at least so thought eva
and dorothi as thei stood for a moment by the monument to five
unknown sailor wash ashor after a great gale and buri in a
common grave how mani suffer er human be had stood upon
the same spot and thought the same thought how mani more now
sleep in the womb of time would stand there and think them when
these two had suffer and er their full and been long forgotten
thei form a strang contrast those two sweet women as thei pass
togeth into the sacr still of the churchth on state
dark and splendid with an unrest troubl in her ey the other
almost insignific in figur but pure and patient of face and with
steadi blue ey which never waver did thei guess those two as
thei walk thu togeth how close their destin were link did
thei know that each at heart wa strive for the same prizea poor
on inde but still all the world to them perhap thei did veri
vagu and it wa the pressur of their common troubl that drew
them closer togeth in those dai but if thei did thei never spoke
of it and as for littl dorothi she never dream of win she
wa content to be allow to toil along in the pain race
when thei reach the pew that the ceswick habitu occupi thei
found miss ceswick and florenc alreadi there jeremi had refus to
come he had a most unreason antipathi to parson mr halford he
like but of thi new man he would have none the gener curios
to see him wa to jeremi inexplic hi opinion be that he
should soon see a great deal more of him than he like just like a
pack of girl run after a new doll he growl well there is
on thing you will soon be tire of hear him squeak
as the servic went on the aisl of the great church grew dim except
where the set sun shot a crimson shaft through the west window
which wander from spot to spot and face to face and made them
gloriou when it came to the hymn befor the sermon eva could
scarc see to read and with the except of the crimson pencil of
sunlight that came through the head of the virgin mari and waver
restlessli about and the strong glow of the light upon the pulpit
the church wa almost dark
when the new clergyman mr plowden ascend the step of the ancient
pulpit and gave out hi text eva look at him in common with the
rest of the congreg mr plowden wa a larg man of a somewhat
lumber make hi head too wa larg and cover with mass of
rather coarsetextur black hair the forehead wa promin and
gave sign of intellectu power the eyebrow thick and
stronglymark and in curiou contrast to the cold lightgrei ey
that plai unceasingli beneath them all the lower part of the face
which to judg from the purpl hue of the skin natur had intend
should be plentifulli cloth with hair wa clean shaven and
reveal a larg jaw squar chin and pair of thick lip altogeth
mr plowden wa consid a fine man and hi face wa gener
spoken of as strike perhap the most curiou thing about it
howev wa a speci of varicos vein on the forehead which wa
gener quit unnotic but whenev he wa excit or nervou
stood out abov the level of the skin in the form of a perfect cross
it wa thu visibl when eva look at him and it struck her as be
an unpleas mark to have on on forehead she turn her ey
awayth man did not pleas her fastidi tasteand listen for
hi voic present it came it wa power and even music but
coars
he is not a gentleman thought eva to herself and then dismiss
him and hi sermon too from her mind she lean back against the
poppyhead at the end of the pew halfclos her ey and let her
thought wander in the wai that thought have the power to do in
church far cross the sea thei flew to where a great vessel
labour in a heavi gale wa plough her steadi wai alongto
where a young man stood cling to the iron stanchion and gaze out
into the dark with sorrow in hi ey
wonderfulli soft and tender grew her beauti face as the vision
pass befor her soul the ripe lip quiver and there wa a world
of love in the halfopen ey and just then the wander patch of
glori perceiv her settl on her like a butterfli upon a flower
and for a while wander no longer
suddenli she becam awar of a momentari paus in the even flow of the
clergyman eloqu and wake from her reveri glanc up at that
spot of light surround him and as she did so it struck her that
she herself wa illumin with a more beauti lightthat he and
she alon were distinguish out of all the peopl beneath that
roof
the same thought had evid struck mr plowden for he wa gaze
intent at her
instinct she drew back into the shadow and mr plowden went on
with hi sermon but he had driven awai poor eva vision there onli
remain of it the sad reproach look of those dark ey
outsid the church dorothi found jeremi wait to escort her home
thei all went togeth as far as the cottag when thei got clear of
the crowd florenc spoke
what a goodlook man mr plowden is and how well he preach
i did not like him much said dorothi
what do you think of him eva ask florenc
i oh i do not know i do not think he is a gentleman
i am sure that he is not put in jeremi i saw him by the
postoffic thi morn he is a cad
rather a sweep remark that is it not mr jone said florenc
i dont know if it is sweep or not answer jeremi
sententi but i am sure that it is true
then thei said goodnight and went their separ wai
chapter iii
eva take a district
the reverend jame plowden wa born of rich but honest parent in the
sugarbrok wai he wa on of a larg famili who were object of
anxiou thought to mr and mr plowden these worthi peopl awar of
the disadvantag under which thei labour in the matter of
educ determin that neither troubl nor monei should be spare
to make their children genteel and so it came to pass that the
mansion near bloomsburi wa overrun with the most expens nurs
millin gover and tutor all strain everi nerv to
secur the perfect gentil of the young plowden the result wa
highli ornament but scarc equival to the vast expens
incur the plowden youth of both sex mai be said to have been
paint and varnish and gild into an admir imit of
gentlefolk but if the lacquerwork would stand the buffet of the
world weather wa anoth question and on which doe not concern
us except in so far as it ha to do with a singl member of the
famili
master jame plowden came about halfwai down the famili list but he
might just as well have stood at the head of it for he rule hi
brother and sistersold and youngwith a heavi rod he wa the
strong on of the famili strong both in mind and bodi and he had a
hand of iron
for hi misde were hi brother thrash prefer to take those
ill thei knew of from the hand of the thrasher rather than endur
the unimagin horror brother jame would make readi for them should
thei ventur to protest
thu it wa that he becam to be consid par excel the good
boi of the famili as he wa certainli the clever on and bore everi
sort of blush honour thick upon him
it wa to an occurr in hi boyhood that mr plowden ow hi
parent determin to send him into the church hi futur career
had alwai been a matter of much specul to them for thei
belong to that class of peopl who love to arrang their infant
destin when the infant themselv ar still in the cradl and
argu their fit for certain line of life from remark which thei
make at three year old
now jamess mamma had a veri favourit parrot with a red tail and
out of thi tail it wa jamess delight to pull the feather have
discov that so do gave a parrot a live twing of pain the
onu of the featherpul if discov wa shoulder on to a
chosen brother who wa promptli thrash
but on on occas thing went wrong with master jame the parrot
wa climb up the outsid of hi cage present the remaind of
hi tail to the hand of the spoiler in a wai that wa irresist
seduct but awar of the fact that hi enemi wa in the
neighbourhood he kept a care lookout from the corner of hi ey
and the moment that he saw jamess stealthi hand draw near hi tail
made a sudden dart at it and actual succeed in make hi
power beak meet through it forefing jame shriek with pain
and furi and shake the bird on to the floor stun it with a
book but he wa not satisfi with thi reveng for as soon as he
saw that it could no longer bite he seiz it and twist it neck
there you devil he said throw the creatur into the cage
hullo someth ha burst in my forehead
o jame what have you done said hi littl brother montagu well
know that he had a live person interest in jamess misdo
nonsens what have you done now rememb montagu you kill
the parrot
just then mr and mr plowden came in from a drive and a veri live
scene ensu into which we need not enter suffic it to sai that
all evid to the contrari notwithstand jame wa acquit on
the ground of gener good charact and montagu howl and
protest hi innoc wa led off to execut justli fear
lest someth further should transpir jame wa hurriedli leav
the room when hi mother call him back
why what is that on your forehead
dont know answer jame someth went snap there just now
well i never just look at the boi john he ha got a cross upon hi
forehead
mr plowden papa examin the phenomenon veri carefulli and then
solemnli remov hi spectacl remark with much deliber
elizabeth that settl the point
what point john
what point why the point of the boi profess it is as you
remark a cross upon hi forehead goodh shall go into the church
now i must declin to be argu with elizabeth the matter is
settl
and so in due cours jame plowden esq went to cambridg and
becam the reverend jame plowden
shortli after the reverend jame had start in life as a
curatehav first beguil hi parent into settl on himself a
portion just twice as larg as that to which he wa entitledh found
it conveni to cut off hi connect with a famili he consid
vulgar and a drag upon hi profession success but somehow with
all hi giftsand undoubtedli he wa by natur wellendow
especi as regard hi mind that wa remark for a speci of
hard clever and persuas powerand with all the advantag
which he deriv from be in receipt of an independ incom the
reverend jame had not hitherto prove a conspicu success he had
held some import curaci and of late had act as the locum
tenen of sever gentlemen who like mr halford through loss of
health or other reason had been call awai from their live for a
length of time
but from all these place the reverend jame had depart without
regret nor had there been ani veri univers lament over hi
go the fact of the matter wa that the reverend jame wa not a
popular man he had abil in plenti and monei in plenti and would
expend both without stint if he had an end to gain he wa more or
less of a good companion too in the ordinari sens of the word that
is he could make himself agreeabl in a rough exagger kind of
wai to both men and women inde by the former he wa often spoken
of carelessli as a good fellow but women or rather ladi
follow their finer instinct dislik him intens he jar
upon them
of cours it is imposs to lai down ani fix rule about men but
there ar two token by which thei mai be known the first is by their
friend the second by the degre of friendship and affect to which
thei ar admit by women the man to whom member of the other sex
attach themselv is in ninetynin case out of a hundr a good
fellow and women instinct tell them so or thei would not love
him it mai be urg that women often love blackguard to thi the
answer is that there must be a good deal of good mix up with the
blackguard show me the man whom two or three women of hi own rank
love or have love with all their honest heart and i will trust all
i have into hi hand and not be a penni the poorer
but women did not love the reverend jame plowden although he had for
sever year come to the conclus that it wa desir that thei
should or rather that on of them should in plain languag he had
for some year past thought that he would improv hi posit by
get marri he wa a shrewd man and he could not disguis from
himself the fact that so far he wa not altogeth a success he had
tri hi best but with all hi consider advantag he had
fail there wa onli on avenu to success which he had not tri
and that wa marriag marriag with a woman of high cast quick
intellect and beauti might give him the tone that hi social
posit so badli need he wa a man in a good posit he had
monei he had intellig of a robust if of a coars order he had
fairli good look and he wa onli thirtyf why should he not
marri blood brain and beauti and shine with a reflect splendour
such were the thought which were simmer in the astut brain of the
reverend jame plowden when he first set ey upon eva ceswick in the
old church at kesterwick
within a week or so of hi arriv mr plowden in hi charact of
spiritu advis to the motlei kesterwick flock paid a ceremoni
call on the miss ceswick thei were all at home
miss ceswick and florenc welcom him gracious eva polit but
with an air that said plainli that he interest her not at all yet
it wa to eva that he chiefli direct himself he took thi
opportun to inform them all especi eva that he felt the
respons of hi posit as locum tenen to weigh heavili upon
him he appeal to them all especi eva to help him bear hi
load he wa go to institut a new system of district visit
would thei all especi eva assist him if thei would the good
work wa alreadi half done there wa so much for young ladi to do
he could assur them from hi person experi that on visit
from a young ladi howev useless she might be in a gener wai
which hi instinct assur him these particular young ladi befor
him were not had more influenc with a distress and godless famili
than six from wellmean but unsympathet clergymen like himself
might he reli on their help
i am afraid that i am too old for that sort of thing mr plowden
answer miss ceswick you might see what you can do with my niec
i am sure that i shall be delight to help said florenc if eva
will bear me compani i alwai feel a shyness about intrud myself
into cottag unsupport
your shyness is not surpris miss ceswick i suffer from it
myself for mani year but at last i have i am thank to sai got
the better of it but i am sure that we shall not appeal to your
sister in vain
i shall be glad to help if you think that i can do ani good put in
eva thu directli appeal to but i must tell you i have no great
faith in myself
do the work miss ceswick and the faith will come sow the seed and
the tree will spring up and bear fruit too in due season
there wa no repli so he continu then i have your permiss to
put you down for a district
o ye mr plowden answer florenc will you take some more
tea
mr plowden would take no more tea but went on hi wai to finish the
dai work he had map out for himselffor he work hard and
accord to a strict rulereflect that eva ceswick wa the
loveliest woman he had ever seen
i think that we must congratul you on a conquest eva said miss
ceswick cheerfulli as the front door close mr plowden never took
hi ey off you and realli my dear i do not wonder at it you look
charm
eva flush up angrili
nonsens aunt she said and left the room
realli said miss ceswick i dont know what ha come to eva
late she is so veri strang
i expect that you have touch her on a sore point i rather fanci
that she ha taken a like to mr plowden said florenc dryli
o inde answer the old ladi nod her head wise
in due cours a district wa assign to the two miss ceswick and
for her part eva wa glad of the occup it brought her a good
deal into contact with mr plowden which wa not altogeth pleasant
to her for she cherish a vagu dislik of the clergyman and did
not admir hi shifti ey but as she got to know him better she
could find noth to justifi her dislik he wa not it is true
quit a gentleman but that wa hi misfortun hi manner to herself
wa subdu and almost deferenti he never obtrud himself upon her
societi though somehow he wa in it almost daili inde he even
succeed in rais her to some enthusiasm about her work a qualiti
in which poor eva had of late been sadli lack she thought him a
veri good clergyman with hi heart in hi duti but she dislik him
all the same
eva never answer ernest letter onc she began an answer but
bethought her of florenc sage advic and chang her mind he
will write again she said to herself she did not know ernest hi
wa not a natur to humbl itself befor a woman could she have seen
her lover hang about the step of the maritzburg postoffic when
the english mail wa be deliv in order to go back to the
window when the peopl had dispers and ask the tire clerk if he
wa sure that there were no more letter for ernest beyton and get
sever snub for hi pain perhap her heart would have relent
and yet it wa a perform which poor ernest went through onc a
week out there in natal
on maildai mr alston went with him
well ernest ha it come he ask as he came down the step a
letter from dorothi in hi hand
no alston and never will she ha thrown me over
mr alston took hi arm and walk awai with him across the
marketsquar
look here my lad he said the woman who desert a man in troubl
or as soon as hi back is turn is worthless it is a sharp lesson
to learn but as most men have caus to know the world is full of
sharp lesson and worthless women you know that she got your letter
ye she told my friend so
then i tell you that your eva or whatev her name is is more
worthless than most of them she ha been tri and found want
look he went on point to a shape kafir girl pass with a pot
of nativ beer on her head you had better take that intombi to wife
than such a woman as thi eva she at ani rate would stand by you in
troubl and if you fell would stop to be kill over your dead bodi
come be a man and have done with her
ay by heaven i will answer ernest
that right and now look here the waggon will be at lydenburg in
a week let us take the postcart tomorrow and go up then we can
have a month vilderbeest and koodoo shoot until it is safe to go
into the fever countri onc you get among the big game you wont
think ani more about that woman women ar all veri well in their wai
but if it come to choos between them and big game shoot give
me the big game

all the parti at dum ness were much touch by thi letter more
especi dorothi who could not bear to think of ernest all alon
out there in that strang faroff land her tender littl heart grew
aliv with love and sorrow as she lai awak at night and thought of
him travel over the great african plain she got all the book
that were to be had about south africa and read them so that she
might be the better abl to follow hi life in her thought on dai
when florenc came to see her she read her part of ernest letter
and when she had finish she wa astonish to see a tear in her
visitor keen ey she like florenc the better for that tear
could she have seen the conflict that wa rage in the fierc heart
of the woman befor her she would have start from her as though she
had been a poison snake the letter touch florencetouch her
to the quick the tale of ernest loneli almost overcam her
resolut for she alon knew why he wa so utterli lone and what
it wa that crush him had ernest alon been concern it is
probabl that she would then and there have thrown up her cruel game
but he wa not alon concern there wa her sister who had rob
her of her loverh sister whose loveli wa a stand affront
to her as her sweet wa a stand reproach she wa sorri for
ernest and would have been glad to make him happier but as that
could onli be done by forego reveng upon her sister ernest must
continu to suffer and after all why should he not suffer she
argu did not she suffer
when florenc got home she told eva about the letter from her love
but she said noth of hi evid distress he wa make friend
he expect great pleasur from hi shootingaltogeth he wa
get on well
eva listen harden her heart and went out district visit with
mr plowden
time went on and no letter came from ernest on month two month
six month pass and there wa no intellig of him dorothi grew
veri anxiou and so did mr cardu but thei did not speak of the
matter much except to remark that the reason no doubt wa that he wa
awai on hi shoot excurs
jeremi also in hi slow wai grew intens preoccupi with the fact
that thei never heard from ernest now and that life wa consequ
a blank he sat upon the stool in hi uncl outer offic and made
pretenc to copi deed and draft but in realiti he occupi hi time
in assidu polish hi nail and think as for the deed and
draft he gave them to hi grandfath to copi it kept the old
gentleman emploi he would explain to dorothi and from indulg
in bad thought about the devil
but it wa on night out duckshoot that hi great inspir
came it wa a bitter night a night on which no sane creatur except
jeremi would ever have dream of go to shoot duck or anyth
els the marsh were partial frozen and a fierc east wind wa
blow across them but utterli regardless of the cold there sat
jeremi under the ic of a dike bank listen for the sound of the

he wa to leav dum ness earli on the thursdai on the wednesdai
afternoon it occur to him that he might as well tell eva ceswick
that he wa go in search of ernest and ask if she had ani messag
jeremi wa the onli person or thought that he wa the onli person in
the secret of ernest affect for eva ernest had ask him to keep
it secret and he had kept it secret as the dead never breath a
word of it even to hi sister
it wa about five oclock on a windi march afternoon when he set out
for the cottag on the edg of the hamlet of kesterwick some three
hundr yard from the cliff stood two or three littl hovel
turn their nake face to the full furi of the seablast he wa
draw near to these when he came to a stile which gave passag over
a sod wall that ran to the edg of the cliff mark the limit of
the villag common as he approach the stile the wind brought him
the sound of voicesa man and a womansengag appar in
angri disput on the farther side of the wall instead of get over
the stile he step to the right and look over the wall and saw
the new clergyman mr plowden stand with hi back toward him
and appar veri much against her will hold eva ceswick by the
hand jeremi wa too far off to overhear hi word but from hi voic
it wa clear that plowden wa talk in an excit master tone
just then eva turn her head a littl and he did hear what she said
her voic be so much clearer
no mr plowden no let go my hand ah why will you not take an
answer
just at that moment she succeed in wrench her imprison hand
from hi strong grasp and without wait for ani more word set off
toward kesterwick almost at a run
jeremi wa a man of slow mind though when onc hi mind wa made up
it wa of a singularli determin natur at first he did not quit
take in the full signific of the scene but when he did a great
red flush spread over hi honest face and the big grei ey sparkl
danger present mr plowden turn and saw him jeremi notic
that the sign of the cross wa remark visibl on hi forehead
and that hi face wore an express by no mean pleasant to
beholdanyth but a christian in short
hullo he said to jeremi what ar you do there
befor answer jeremi put hi hand on the top of the sod wall and
vault over walk straight up to the clergyman
i wa watch you he said look him straight in the ey
indeedan honour employ eavesdrop i think it is
gener call
whatev had pass between mr plowden and eva ceswick it had
clearli not improv the former temper
what do you mean
i mean what i sai
well mr plowden i mai as well tell you what i mean i am not
good at talk but i know that i shall be abl to make you
understand i saw you just now assault miss ceswick
it is a lie
that is not a gentlemanlik word mr plowden but as you ar not a
gentleman i will overlook it jeremi after the danger fashion of
the anglosaxon race alwai got wonderfulli cool as a row thicken
i repeat that i saw you hold her notwithstand her struggl to
get awai
and what is that to you confound you said mr plowden shake
with furi and rais a thick stick he held in hi hand in a
suggest manner
dont lose your temper and you shall hear miss eva ceswick is
engag to my friend ernest kershaw or someth veri like it and
as he is not here to look after hi own interest i must look after
them for him
ah ye answer mr plowden with a ghastli smile i have heard
of that the murder you mean
i recommend you mr plowden in your own interest to be a littl
more care in your term
and suppos that there ha been someth between youryour
friend
much better term mr plowden
and miss eva ceswick what i should like to know is there to
prevent her have chang her mind
jeremi laugh aloud it must be admit rather insol and in a
wai calcul to irrit peopl of meeker mind than mr plowden
to ani on mr plowden who ha the privileg of your acquaint
and who also know ernest kershaw your question would seem absurd
you see there ar some peopl between whom there can be no
comparison it is not possibl that after care for ernest ani
woman could care for you and jeremi laugh again
mr plowden thick lip turn quit pale the veinou cross upon hi
forehead throb until jeremi thought that it would burst and hi
ey shone with the concentr light of hate hi vaniti wa hi
weakest point he control himself with an effort howev though
if there had been ani deadli weapon at hand it might have gone hard
with jeremi
perhap you will explain the mean of your interfer and your
insol and let me go on
oh with pleasur answer jeremi with refresh cheer
it is just thi if i catch you at ani such trick again you shall
suffer for it on cant thrash a clergyman and on cant fight him
becaus he wont fight but look here on can shake him for that
leav no mark and if you go on with these game so sure as my name
is jeremi jone i will shake your teeth down your throat
goodnight and jeremi turn to go
it is not wise to turn on back upon an infuri anim and at
that moment mr plowden wa noth more even as he turn jeremi
rememb thi and gave himself a slew to on side it wa fortun
for him that he did so for at that moment mr plowden heavi
blackthorn stick direct downward with all the strength of mr
plowden power arm pass within a few inch of hi head out of
which had he not turn it would have probabl knock the brain
as it wa it struck the ground with such forc that the jar sent it
fly out of it owner hand
ah you would wa jeremi reflect as he sprang at hi
assail
now mr plowden wa a veri power man but he wa no match for
jeremi who in after dai came to be known as the strongest man in the
east of england and so wa destin to find him out onc jeremi got
a grip of himfor hi respect for the church prevent him from
try to knock him downh seem to crumpl up like a piec of
paper in hi iron grasp jeremi could easili have thrown him but he
would not he had hi own end in view so he just held the reverend
jame tight enough to prevent him from do him ani seriou injuri
and let him struggl frantic till he thought he wa suffici
exhaust for hi purpos then jeremi suddenli gave him a violent
twist got behind him and set to work with a will to fulfil hi
promis of a shake o what a shake that wa first of all he shook
him backward and forward for ernest sake then he altern the
motion and shook him from side to side for hi own sake and final
he shook him everi possibl wai for the sake of eva ceswick
it wa a wonder sight to see the great burli clergyman hi hat
off hi white tie undon and hi coattail wave like streamer
bound and gambol on the breezi cliff hi head leg and arm
jerk in everi possibl direct like those of a galvanis frog
while behind him hi leg slightli apart to get a better grip of the
ground and hi teeth firmli clinch jeremi shook awai with the
fixiti of fate
at last get exhaust he stop and hold mr plowden still
gave him a dropkickonli on but jeremi leg wa veri strong and
he alwai wore thick boot and the result wa startl mr plowden
rose some inch off the ground and went on hi face into a
furzebush
he will hardli like to show that honour wound reflect
jeremi as he wipe the perspir from hi brow with everi sign of
satisfact
he went and pick hi fallen enemi out of the bush where he had
nearli faint smooth hi cloth ti the white tie as nearli as
he could and put the wide hat on the dishevel hair then he sat
him down on the furz to recov himself
goodnight mr plowden goodnight next time you wish to hit a man
with a big stick do not wait till hi back is turn ah i daresai
your head ach i should advis you to go home and have a nice
sleep
and jeremi depart on hi wai fill with a fear joi
when he reach the cottag he found everyth in a state of
confus miss ceswick it appear had been suddenli taken veri
serious ill inde it wa fear that she had got a stroke of
apoplexi he manag howev to send up a messag to eva to sai that

chapter v
florenc on marriag
miss ceswick seizur turn out to be even wors than wa
anticip onc she appear to regain conscious and began to
mutter someth then she sank back into a torpor out of which she
never woke again
it wa fortun that her condit wa not such as to requir the
servic of the clergyman becaus for some time after the event
describ in the last chapter mr plowden wa not in ani condit to
give them whether it wa the shake or the wellplant kick or the
shock to hi system it is imposs to sai but in the upshot he wa
constrain to keep hi bed for sever dai inde the first
servic that he took wa on the occas of the open of the ancient
ceswick vault to receiv the remain of the recent deceas ladi
the onli territori possess which remain to the ceswick wa
their vault inde as florenc afterward remark to her sister
there wa a certain ironi in the reflect that of all their wide
acr there remain onli the few squar feet of soil which for
centuri had cover the bone of the race
when their aunt wa dead and buri the two girl went back to the
cottag and were veri desol thei had both of them love the old
ladi in their separ wai more especi florenc both becaus
she possess the deeper natur of the two and becaus she had live
the longest with her
but the grief of youth at the departur of ag is not inconsol
and after a month or so thei had conquer the worst of their sorrow
then it wa that the question what thei were to do came promin to
the fore such littl properti as their aunt had possess wa equal
divid between them and the cottag left to their joint us thi
gave them enough to live on in their quiet wai but it undoubtedli
left them in a veri lone and unprotect posit such as it wa
howev thei or rather florencefor she manag all the
businessdecid to make the best of it at kesterwick at ani rate
thei were known and it wa thei felt better to stai there than to
float awai and becom waif and strai on the great sea of english
life so thei settl to stai
florenc moreov had her own reason for stai she had come to
the conclus that it would be desir that her sister eva should
marri mr plowden not that she like mr plowdenh ladi
instinct rose up in rebellion against the manbut if eva did not
marri him it as probabl that she would in the longrun marri ernest
and ernest florenc swore she should not marri to prevent such a
marriag wa the main purpos of her life her jealousi and hatr of
her sister had becom a part of herself the gratif of her
reveng wa the evil star by which she shape her cours it mai seem
a terribl thing that so young a woman could give the best energi of
her life to such a purpos but it wa none the less the truth
her wa a wild strang natur a natur capabl of violent love and
violent hate the same pendulum could swing with equal eas to each
extrem eva had rob her of her lover she would rob eva and put
the prize out of her reach too littl she reck of the wicked of
her design for where in the long record of human suffer is there a
wicked to surpass the deliber separ for no good reason
of two peopl who love each other with all their heart sure there
is none she knew thi but she did not hesit on that account she
wa not hypocrit she made no excus to herself she knew well
that on everi ground it wa best that eva should marri ernest and
pursu her natur destini happi in hi love and in her own but she
would have none of it if onc thei should meet again the game would
pass out of her hand for the weakest woman grow strong of purpos
when she ha her lover arm to lean on florenc realis thi and
determin that thei should never set ey on each other until an
impass barrier in the shape of mr plowden had been rais
between the two have thu final determin on the sacrific she
set about whet the knife
on dai a month or so after miss ceswick wa buri mr plowden
call at the cottag on some of the endless detail of which
districtvisit wa the parent he had hardli seen eva sinc that
nevertobeforgotten dai when he had learn what jeremi idea of a
shake were for the veri good reason that she had carefulli kept out
of hi wai
so it came to pass that when look out of the window on the
afternoon in question she saw the crown of a cleric hat come
along the road eva promptli gather up her work and commenc a
hasti retreat to her bedroom
where ar you go to eva ask her sister
upstairsher he come
he who is he
mr plowden of cours
and why should you run awai becaus mr plowden is come
i do not like mr plowden
realli eva you ar too bad you know what a friendless posit we
ar in right now and you go and get up a dislik to on of the few
men we know it is veri selfish of you and most unreason
at that moment the frontdoor bell rang and eva fled
mr plowden on enter look round the room with a somewhat
disappoint air
if you ar look for my sister said florenc she is not veri
well
inde i am afraid that her health is not good she is so often
indispos
florenc smile and thei drop into the districtvisit
present howev florenc drop out again
by the wai mr plowden i want to tell you of someth i heard the
other dai and which concern you inde i think that it is onli
right that i should do so i heard that you were seen talk to my
sister not veri far from the titheburgh abbei cottag and that
shesh ran awai from you then mr jone jump over the wall and
also began to talk with you present he also turn and so said my
inform you struck at him with a heavi stick but miss him
thereupon a tussl ensu and you got the worst of it
he irrit me beyond all endur broke in mr plowden
excitedli
o then the stori is true
mr plowden saw that he had made a fatal mistak but it wa too late
to deni it
to a certain extent he said sulkili that young ruffian told me
that i wa not a gentleman
realli of cours that wa unpleas but how glad you must feel
that you miss him especi as hi back wa turn it would have
look so bad for a clergyman to be had up for assault or wors
wouldnt it
mr plowden turn pale and bit hi lip he began to feel that he wa
in the power of thi quiet dignifi young woman and the feel wa
not pleasant
and it would not look well if the stori got round here would it i
mean even if it wa not known that you hit at him with the stick when
he wa not look becaus you see it would seem so absurd
mr plowden winc beneath her mockeri and rise seiz hi hat
but she motion him back to hi chair
dont go yet she said i want to tell you that you ought to be
much oblig to me for think of all thi for you i thought that it
would be pain for you to have the stori all over the countrysid
so i nip it in the bud
mr plowden groan in spirit if these were the result of a stori
nip in the bud what would it uninjur bloom be like
who told you he ask brusqu jone went awai
ye how glad you must be by the wai that he is gone but it wa
not mr jone it wa a person who oversaw the differ of opinion
no never mind who it wa i have found mean to silenc that person
littl did mr plowden guess that dure the whole cours of hi
lovescen and the subsequ affair with jeremi there had lean
gracefulli in an angl of the sod wall not twenti yard awai a
figur uncommonli resembl that of an ancient marin in an attitud
of the most intens and solemn contempl but so it wa
i am grate to you miss ceswick
thank you mr plowden it is refresh to meet with true gratitud
it is a scarc flower in thi world but realli i dont deserv ani
the observ who oversaw the pain scene between you and mr jone
also oversaw a scene preced it that so far as i can gather seem
to have been hardli less pain in it wai
mr plowden colour but said noth
now you see mr plowden i am left in a rather peculiar posit as
regard my sister she is younger than i am and ha alwai been
accustom to look up to me so as you will easili understand i feel
my respons to weigh upon me consequ i feel bound to
ask you what i am to understand from the report of my inform
simpli thi miss ceswick i propos to your sister and she refus
me
inde you were unfortun that afternoon
miss ceswick went on mr plowden after a paus if i could find
mean to induc your sister to chang her verdict would my suit have
your support
florenc rais her pierc ey from her work and for a second
fix them on the clergyman face
that depend mr plowden
i am well off he went on eagerli and i will tell you a secret i
have bought the advowson of thi live i happen to hear that it
wa go and got it at a bargain i dont think that halford life
is worth five year purchas
why do you want to marri eva mr plowden ask florenc ignor
thi piec of inform you ar not in love with her
in love no miss ceswick i dont think that sensibl men fall in
love thei leav that to boi and women
oh then why do you want to marri eva it will be best to tell me
frankli mr plowden
he hesit and then came to the conclus that with a person of
florenc penetr frank wa the best game
well as you must know your sister is an extraordinarili beauti
woman
and would therefor form a desir addit to your establish
precis said mr plowden also he went on she is a
distinguishedlook woman and quit the ladi
florenc shudder at the phrase
and would therefor give you social statu mr plowden
ye she is also sprung from an ancient famili
florenc smile and look at mr plowden with an air that said more
plainli than ani word which you clearli ar not
in short i am anxiou to get marri and i admir your sister eva
more than anybodi i ever saw
all of which ar veri satisfactori reason mr plowden all you have
to do is convinc my sister of the mani advantag you have to offer
her andto win her affect
ah miss ceswick that is just the point she told me that her
affect were alreadi irredeem engag and that she had none to
give if onli i have the opportun howev i shall hope to be abl
to outdist my rival
florenc look at him scrutinisingli as she answer
you do not know ernest kershaw or you would not be so confid
why am i not as good as thi ernest he ask for florenc
remark ident as it wa with that of jeremi wound hi vaniti
intens
well mr plowden i do not want to be rude but it is imposs for
me to conceiv a woman affect be won awai from ernest kershaw
by you you ar so veri differ
if mr plowden want a straightforward answer he had certainli got
it for some moment he sat in sulki silenc and then he said
i suppos if that is the case there is noth to be done
i never said that women ar frequent marri whose affect ar
veri much engag elsewher you know how thei win their wive in
savag countri mr plowden thei catch them marriag by captur is
on of the oldest institut in the world
well
well the same institut still obtain in england onli we dont
call it by that name do you suppos that no women ar hunt down
nowadai ah veri mani ar the wouldb husband head the pack and
all the love rel swell it cry
you mean that your sister can be hunt down he said bluntli
i i mean noth except that the persist suitor on the spot
often ha a better chanc than the lover at a distanc howev dear
he mai be
then mr plowden took hi leav florenc watch him walk down the
gardenpath
i am glad jeremi shook you soundli she said aloud poor eva
chapter vi
mr plowden goe awoo
mr plowden wa not a suitor to let the grass grow under hi feet as
he onc took the troubl to explain to florenc he consid that
there wa noth like bold in woo and he act up to hi
convict possess no more delicaci of feel than a
bulleleph and as much consider for the ladi as the eleph
ha for a lili it trampl underfoot figur speak he
charg at eva everi time he saw her he laid wait for her round
corner and ask her to marri him he drop in on her at odd
hour and insist upon her marri him it wa quit useless for
her to sai no no no or to appeal to hi better feel or
compass for he had none he simpli would not listen to her but
encourag thereto by the moral support which he had receiv from
florenc he crush the poor girl with hi amor eloqu
it wa a merri chase that florenc sat and watch with a dark smile
on her scorn lip in vain did the poor white doe dash along at her
best speed the great black hound wa ever at her flank and each time
she turn came bound at her throat thi idea of a chase and a
hound and a doe took such a strong possess of florenc saturnin
imagin that she actual made a draw of it for she wa a
clever artist and not without train throw by a few stroke of
her pencil a perfect like of mr plowden into the fierc featur
of the hound the doe she drew with eva dark ey and when she had
done them there wa such agoni in her tortur gaze that she could not
bear to look at them and tore the pictur up
on dai florenc came in and found her sister weep
well eva what is it now she ask contemptu
mr plowden sob eva
oh mr plowden again well my dear if you will be so beauti
and encourag men you must take the consequ
i never encourag mr plowden
nonsens eva you will not get me to believ that if you did not
encourag him he would not go on make love to you gentlemen ar not
fond of be snub
mr plowden is not a gentleman exclaim eva
what make you sai that
becaus a gentleman would not persecut on as he doe he will not
take no for an answer and todai he kiss my hand i tri to get it
awai from him but i could not oh i hate him
i tell you what it is eva i have no patienc with you and your
fanci mr plowden is a veri respect man he is a clergyman and
well off altogeth quit the sort of man to marri ah ernesti am
sick of ernest if he want to marri you he should not go shoot
peopl and then run off to south africa he wa all veri well to
flirt with while he wa here now he ha made a fool of himself and
gone and there is an end of him
but florenc i love ernest i think i love him more dearli everi
dai and i detest mr plowden
veri like i dont ask you to love mr plowden i ask you to marri
him what have love and marriag got to do with each other i should
like to know if peopl were alwai to marri the peopl thei love
thing would soon get into a pretti mess look here eva as you know
i do not often obtrud myself or my interest but i think that i have
a right to be consid a littl in thi matter you have now got an
opportun of make a home for both of us there is noth against
mr plowden why should you not marri him as well as anybodi els of
cours if you choos to sacrific your own ultim happi and the
comfort of us both to a silli whim i cannot prevent you you ar your
own mistress onli i beg you to disabus your mind of the idea that
you could not be happi with mr plowden becaus you happen to fanci
yourself in love with ernest why in six month you will have
forgotten all about him
but i dont want to forget about him
i daresai not that is your abomin egot again but whether you
want to or not you will in a year or two when you have your own
interest and your children
florenc you mai talk to midnight if you like but onc and for
all i will not marri mr plowden and she swept out of the room in
her state wai
florenc laugh softli to herself as she said after her
oh ye you will eva i shall be pin a bride veil on to that
pretti head of your befor you ar six month older my dear
florenc wa quit right it wa onli a question of time and cunningli
appli pressur eva yield at last
but there is no need for us to follow the hate stori through it
variou stage if by chanc ani of the reader of thi histori ar
curiou about them let them go and studi from the life such case
exist around them and so far as the victim ar concern there is
a pain monotoni in the develop of their detail and their
conclus
and so it came to pass that on afternoon in the earli summer
florenc come in from walk found mr plowden and her sister
togeth in the littl drawingroom the latter wa veri pale and
shrink with scare ey and trembl limb up against the
mantelpiec near which she wa stand the former look big and
vulgar wa stand over her and try to take her hand
congratul me miss florenc he said eva ha promis to be
mine
ha she said florenc coldli how glad you must be that mr jone
is out of the wai
it wa not a kind speech but the fact wa that there were few peopl
in the world for whom florenc had such a complet contempt or whom
she regard with such intens dislik as she did mr plowden the
mere presenc of the man irrit her beyond all bear he wa an
instrument suit to her purpos so she us him but she could find
it in her heart to regret that the instrument wa not more pleasant to
handl
mr plowden turn pale at her taunt and even in the midst of her
fear and miseri eva smile and thought to herself that it wa lucki
for her hate lover that somebodi els wa out of the wai
poor eva
poor eva you think to yourself my reader there wa noth poor
about her she wa weak she wa wick and contempt
oh paus awhil befor you sai so rememb that circumst were
against her rememb that the idea of duti and of gain drill into
her breast and the breast of her ancestress from gener to
gener and fate as often as not to prove more of a bane than a
bless were against her rememb that her sister everpres
influenc overshadow her and that her suitor vulgar vital
crush her to the ground
yet with it all she wa weak you sai well she wa weak as weak
as you must expect some women to be after centuri of custom have
bred weak into their veri natur why ar women weak becaus men
have made them so becaus the law that wa frame by men and the
public opinion which it ha been their privileg to direct have from
ag to ag drill into women the beliefin which it must be
admit thei for the most part readili acquiescethat thei ar
chattel to be own and plai with exist for man pleasur and
the gratif of hi passion becaus men have systemat
stunt their mental grown and deni them their natur right and
that equal which is their weakwomen have becom weak becaus

the lad face fell
ala he said it is imposs there is a spy watch the camp
now he is up there among the rock i saw him as i brought the oxen
home if we move he will report it and we shall be overtaken in an
hour
mr alston thought for a moment and then made up hi mind with the
rapid that characteris men who spend their live in deal with
savag race
mazooku he call to a zulu who wa sit smoke by the camp
fire a man whom ernest had hire as hi particular servant the man
rose and came to him and salut
he wa not a veri tall man but stand there nude except for the
moocha round hi centr hi proport especi those of the
chest and the lower limb look gigant he had been a soldier in
on of cetywayo regiment but have been so indiscreet as to break
through some of the zulu marriag law had been forc to fly for
refug to natal where he had becom a groom and pick up a peculiar
languag which he call english even among a peopl where all the
men ar fearless he bore a reput for braveri leav him
stand awhil mr alston rapidli explain the state of the case to
ernest and what he propos to do then turn he address the
zulu
mazooku the inkoo here your master whom you black peopl have
name mazimba tell me that he think you a brave man
the zulu handsom face expand into a smile that wa posit
alarm in it extent
he sai that you told him that when you were cetywayo man in the
undi regiment you onc kill four basuto who set upon you
togeth
mazooku lift hi right arm and salut by wai of answer and then
glanc slightli at the assegaiwound on hi chest
well i tell your master that i do not believ you it is a lie you
speak to him you ran awai from cetywayo becaus you did not like to
fight and be kill as the king ox as a brave man should
the zulu colour up under hi duski skin and again glanc at hi
wound
oww he said
bah there is no need for you to look at those scratch thei were

you to speak if you ar not a woman show it there is an arm
basuto among those rock he watch us your master cannot eat and
sleep in peac when he is watch take that big stab assegai you
ar so fond of show and kill him or die a coward he must make no

mazooku turn toward ernest for confirm of the order a zulu
alwai like to take hi order straight from hi own chief mr
alston notic it and ad
i am the inkoosi mouth and speak hi word
mazooku salut again and turn went to the waggon to fetch hi
assegai
tread softli or you will wake him and he will run from so great a
man mr alston call after him sarcast
i go among the rock to seek mouti medicin the zulu answer
with a smile
we ar in a seriou mess my boi said mr alston to ernest and it
is a tossup if we get out of it i taunt that fellow so that there
mai be no mistak about the spy he must be kill and mazooku would
rather die himself than not kill him now
would it not have been safer to send anoth man with him
ye but i wa afraid that if the scout saw two men come toward
him he would make off howev innoc thei might look our hors
ar dead and if that fellow escap we shall never get out of thi
place aliv it would be folli to expect basuto to distinguish
between boer and englishmen when their blood is up and besid
secocoeni ha sent order that we ar to be kill and thei would not
dare to disobei look there goe mr mazooku with an assegai as big
as a fireshovel
the kopj or stoni hill where the spy wa hid wa about three
hundr yard from the littl hollow in which the camp wa form and
across the stretch of bushi plain between the two mazooku wa quietli
stroll hi assegai in on hand and two long stick in the other
present he vanish into the shadow for the sun wa set
rapidli after what seem a long paus to ernest who wa watch
hi movement through a pair of fieldglass he reappear walk
along the shoulder of the hill right against the skylin hi ey
fix upon the ground as though he were search among the crevic
of the rock for the medic herb which zulu prize
all of a sudden ernest saw the stalwart form straighten itself and
spring down into a dip which hid it from sight with the assegai in
it hand rais to the level of it head then came a paus last
perhap for twenti second on the farther side of the dip wa a larg
flat rock which wa straight in a line with the fieri ball of the
set sun suddenli a tall figur sprang up out of the hollow on to
thi rock follow by anoth figur in whom ernest recognis
mazooku for a moment the two men look from their posit like
peopl afir struggl togeth on the top of the flat stone and
ernest could clearli distinguish the quick flash of their spear as
thei struck at each other then thei vanish togeth over the edg
of the stone
by jove said ernest who wa trembl with excit i wonder
how it ha end
we shall know present answer mr alston coolli at ani rate
the die is cast on wai or anoth and we mai as well make a bolt for
it now you zulu down with those tent and get the oxen inspan
and look quick about it if you dont want a basuto assegai to send
you to join the spirit of chaka
the voorloop had by thi time commun hi alarm intellig
to the driver and other kafir and mr alston exhort to look
sharp wa quit unnecessari ernest never saw camp struck or oxen
inspan with such rapid befor but befor the first tent wa
fairli down thei were all enorm reliev to see mazooku come
trot cheerfulli across the plain drone a littl zulu song as he
ran hi appear howev wa by no mean cheer for he wa
perfectli drench with blood some of it flow from a wound in hi
left shoulder and the rest till recent the person properti of
somebodi els arriv in front of where mr alston and ernest were
stand he rais hi broad assegai which wa still drip blood
and salut
i hear said mr alston
i have done the inkoosi mazimba bid there were two of them
the first i kill easili in the hollow but the other a veri big
man fought well for a basuto thei ar dead and i threw them into a
hole that their brother might not find them easili
good go wash yourself and get your master thing into the waggon
stop let me sew up that cut how came you to be so awkward as to get
touch by a basuto
inkoo he wa veri quick with hi spear and he fought like a cat
mr alston did not repli but take a stout needl and some silk
from a littl housewif he carri in hi pocket he quickli stitch
up the assegaigash which fortun wa not deep mazooku stood
without flinch till the job wa finish and then retir to wash
himself at the spring
the short twilight fade rapidli into dark or rather into what
would have been dark had it not been for the halfgrown moon
which wa to serv to light them on their path then a larg fire
have been lit on the site of the camp to make it appear as though it
were still pitch there the order wa given to start the oxen
obedi to the voic of the driver strain at the trektow the
waggon creak and jolt and thei began their long flight for life
the order of march wa as follow two hundr yard ahead of the
waggon walk a kafir with strict order to keep hi ey veri wide
open inde and report in the best wai possibl under the
circumst if he detect ani sign of an ambush at the head of
the long line of cattl lead the two front oxen by a reim or
strip of buffalohid wa the zulu boi jim to whose time discoveri
thei ow their live and by the side of the waggon the driver a
cape hottentot plod along in fear and trembl on the waggonbox
itself each with a winchest repeat rifl on hi knee and
keep a sharp lookout into the shadow sat mr alston and ernest
in the hinder part of the waggon also arm with a rifl and keep
a keen lookout sat mazooku the other servant march alongsid
and the boi roger wa asleep insid on the cartl or hide bed
so thei travel on hour after hour now thei bump down terrif
hill strewn with boulder which would have smash anyth less
solid than an african oxwaggon to splinter now thei crept along a
dark vallei that look spiritu and solemn in the moonlight
expect to see secocoeni impi emerg from everi clump of bush and
now again thei wade through mountainsteam at last about midnight
thei reach a plain divid two stretch of mountain countri
and here thei halt for a while to give the oxen which were
fortun in good condit and fat after their long rest a short
breathingtim then on again through the long quiet night on still
on till the dawn found them the other side of the wide plain at the
foot of the mountainrang
here thei rest for two hour and let the oxen fill themselv with
the lush grass thei had travel thirti mile sinc the yoke were
put upon their necksnot far accord to our wai of journei but
veri far for cumbersom oxen over an almost impass countri as
soon as the sun wa well up thei inspan again and hurri
forward bethink them of the basuto hord who would now be
press on their spoor on with brief halt through all that dai and
the greater part of the follow night till the cattl began to fall
down in the yokestil at last thei cross the boundari and were in
transvaal territori
when dawn broke mr alston took the glass and examin the track
over which thei had fled there wa noth to be seen except a great
herd of hartebeest
i think that we ar safe now he said at last and thank god for
it do you know what those basuto devil would have done if thei had
caught us
what
thei would have skin us and made our heart and liver into
mouti medicin and eaten them to give them the courag of the
white man
by jove said ernest
chapter viii
a homer combat
when mr alston and ernest found themselv safe upon transvaal soil
thei determin to give up the idea of follow ani more big game for
the present and to content themselv with the compar humbl
vilderbeest blesbok springbok and other small antelop the plan
thei pursu wa to slowli journei from on point of the countri to
anoth stop wherev thei found the buck particularli plenti
in thi wai thei got excel sport and spent sever month veri
agreeabl with the further advantag that ernest obtain
consider knowledg of the countri and it inhabit the boer
it wa a wild rough life that thei led but by no mean a lower
on the continu contact with natur in all her mood and in her
wildest shape to a man of impression mind like ernest wa an
educ in itself hi mind absorb someth of the great
round him and seem to grow wider and deeper dure those month of
lone travel the long struggl too with the hundr difficulti
which aris in waggonjournei and the quick of decis
necessari to avoid danger or discomfort in such a mode of life were
of great servic to him in shape hi charact nor wa he left
without suitabl societi for in hi companion he found a friend for
whose talent and intellig he had the highest respect
mr alston wa a veri quiet individu he never said a thing unless
he had first consid it in all it bear but when he did sai
it it wa alwai well worth hear he wa a man who had spent hi
life in the closest observ of human natur in the rough now you
my reader mai think that there is a consider differ between
human natur in the rough as exemplifi by a zulu warrior stalk
out of hi kraal in a kaross and brandish an assegai and yourself
sai stroll up the step of your club in a frockcoat and twirl
on of brigg umbrella but as a matter of fact the differ is
of a most superfici charact bear the same proport to the
common substanc that the furnitur polish doe to the tabl scratch
the polish and there you have best raw zulu human natur inde to
anybodi who ha taken the troubl to studi the question it is simpli
absurd to observ how powerless high civilis ha been to do
anyth more than veneer that raw materi which remain ident
in each case
to return the result of mr alston observ had been to make
him an extrem shrewd companion and an excel judg of men and
their affair there were few subject which he had not quietli
consid dure all the year that he had been trade or shoot
or serv the govern in on capac or anoth and ernest wa
astonish to find although he had onli spent some four month of hi
life in england how intim wa hi knowledg of the state of
polit parti of the great social question of the dai and even
of matter connect with literatur and art it is not too much to
sai that it wa from mr alston that ernest imbib principl on all
these subject which he never desert in afterlif and that
subsequ experi prove to be for the most part sound
thu between shoot and philosoph discuss the time pass
on pleasantli enough till at length thei drew near to pretoria the
capit of the transvaal where thei had decid to rest the oxen for
a month or two befor make arrang for a real biggam
excurs up toward central africa thei struck into the pretoria
road just abov a town call heidelberg about sixti mile from the
former place and proceed by easi stage toward their destin
as thei went on thei gener found it conveni to outspan at
spot which it wa evid had been us for the same purpos by some
waggon that wa travel on stage ahead of them so frequent did
thi happen that dure their first five or six outspan thei were
abl on no less than three occas to avail themselv of the dy
fire of their predecessor camp thi wa a matter of live
interest to ernest who alwai did cook and a veri good cook he
becam on of the great bother of south african travel is the
fire question inde how to make suffici fire to boil a kettl
when you have no fuel to make it of is the great question of south
african travel a readymad fire is therefor peculiarli
accept and for the last halfhour of the trek wa ernest alwai
in a great state of expect as to whether the waggon befor them
had or had not been consider enough to leav their burn
thu it came to pass that on morn when thei were about fifteen
mile from pretoria which thei expect to reach the same even
and the waggon wa slowli draw up to the outspanplac ernest
accompani by mazooku who loung after him like a black shadow ran
forward to see if their predecessor had or had not been consider
in thi instanc energi wa reward for the fire wa still burn
hoorah said ernest get the stick mazooku and go and fill the
kettl by jove there a knife
there wa a knife a manyblad knife with a buckhorn handl and a
corkscrew in it left by the dy fire ernest took it up and look
at it somehow it seem familiar to him he turn it round examin
the silver plate upon it and suddenli start
what is the matter ernest said mr alston who had join them
look here he answer point to two initi on the knife
well i see some fellow ha left hi knife so much the better for
the finder
you have heard me speak of my friend jeremi that is hi knife i
gave it to him year ago lookj j
nonsens it is some knife like it i have seen hundr of that
make
i believ that it is the same he must be here
mr alston shrug hi shoulder
not probabl he said
ernest made no answer he stood stare at the knife
have you written to your peopl late ernest
no the last letter i wrote wa down there in secocoeni countri
you rememb i sent it by the basuto who wa go to lydenburg just
befor jeffri di
like enough he never got to lydenburg he would not have dare to go
to lydenburg after the war broke out you should write
i mean to from pretoria but somehow i have had no heart for
write
noth more wa said about the matter and ernest put the knife into
hi pocket
that even thei trek down through the poort that command the
most charm view of the south african town and on the plain
below pretoria bath in the bright glow of the even sunshin
smile it welcom to them mr alston who knew the town determin
to trek straight through it and outspan the waggon on the farther
side where he thought there would be better graze for the cattl
accordingli thei rumbl on past the gaol past the pleasant white
build which wa at that moment occupi by the english special
commission and hi staff about whose do all sort of rumour
had reach them dure their journei and on to the marketsquar
thi area wa at the moment crowd with boer waggon whose owner
had trek in to celebr their nachtmaal communion of which it
is their habit in compani with their wive and children to partak
four time a year the volksraad or local parliament wa also in
special session to consid the propos made to it on behalf of the
imperi govern so that the littl town wa posit choke
with visitor the road down which thei were pass ran past the
build us as govern offic and between thi and the dutch
church a consider crowd wa gather which to judg from the
shout and vollei of oathsdutch and englishthat proceed from
it wa work itself up into a state of excit
hold on shout ernest to the voorloop and then turn to mr
alston there is a jolli row go on there let us go and see what
it is
all right my boi where the fight is there will the englishmen
be gather togeth and thei climb down off the waggon and made
for the crowd
the row wa thi among the boer assembl for the nachtmaal
festiv wa a wellknown giant of the name of van zyl thi man
strength wa a matter of public notorieti all over the countri and
mani were the feat which were told of him among other it wa said
that he could bear the weight of the afterpart of an african buck
waggon on hi shoulder with a load of three thousand pound of corn
upon it while the wheel were greas he stood about six feet seven
high weigh eighteen stone and a half and had a doubl row of
teeth on the even in question thi remark specimen of human
wa sit on hi waggonbox with a pipe of which the size wa
proportion to hi own clinch firmli between hi doubl row of
teeth about ten pace of him stood a young englishman also of larg
size though he look quit small besid the giant who wa
contempl the phenomenon on the waggonbox and wonder how mani
inch he measur round the chest that young englishman had just
descend from a newlyarriv waggon and hi name wa jeremi jone
to these advanc a cring hottentot boi of small size the
hottentot is evid the servant or slave of the giant and a man
stand by jeremi who understand dutch inform him that he is
tell hi master than an ox ha strai slowli the giant rous
himself and descend from the waggonbox seiz the trembl
totti with on hand and take a reim of buffalohid lash him
to the waggonwheel
now remark jeremi acquaint you will see how a boer deal
with a nigger

content himself with dodg hi adversari attack at which the
dutchmen cheer think that hi iron strength wa broken

quiet look of determin in hi ey and except for the gape of
the nostril and the twitch of the lip show a certain measur of
distress look but littl the wors thei turn with anxieti to
examin the condit of the giant it wa not veri promis he wa
perspir profus and hi enorm chest rose and fell in jerk
wherev jeremi stroke had fallen also a great blue bruis had
risen on hi flesh it wa evid that hi condit wa the wors of
the two but still the boer had littl doubt of the issu it could
not be that the man would be worst by an english lad who for a
bet with on hand had onc quell the struggl of a wild ox
hold it for the space of five minut by the horn so thei call
on him to stop plai with the english boi and crush him

alarm spectacl as he came again jeremi hit him in the face but
it did not stop him and in anoth second the huge arm had close
round him and held him like a vice
not fair no hold shout the englishmen but the boer held on
inde he did more put all hi vast strength into the effort he
strain and tug mean to lift jeremi up and dash him on the

crush out of him in that fear embrac and he wa think with
bitter sorrow that he must fail after all for an englishman doe not

had hoist hi teacher with hi own trick
just at the moment that jeremi heard the voic the giant shift hi
hold a littl preparatori to make a fresh effort and thu enabl
hi antagonist to fill hi lung with air ernest saw the broad white
chest heav with relief for by thi time most of the upper cloth
of the combat had been wrench awai and the darken ey grow

enough to fetch ani girl though for hi part he did not quit
understand it mr alston relit hi pipe and for a while said
noth but to himself he thought that it wa a remark letter for
so young a man to have written and reveal a curiou turn of mind
on remark he did make howev and that wa rather a rude on
the girl wont understand what you ar drive at master ernest she
will think that you have gone off your head in these savag part all
you sai mai or mai not be trueon that point i express no opinion
but to write such thing to a woman is to throw your pearl befor
swine you should ask her about her bonnet my boi and tell her what
sort of dress she should bring out and that the air is good for the
complexion she would come then
here ernest fire up
you ar beastli cynic alston and you should not speak of miss
ceswick like that to me bonnet inde

more mud at your ideal in the cours of the last thirti year i have
seen so mani fall to piec of their own accord that i could not help

do you know you nearli provok an outbreak last night with your
fight i trust that you will not do it again
he spoke rather sever and jeremi colour present howev he
made amend by ask them all to dinner
on the follow morn ernest sent off hi letter to eva he also
wrote to hi uncl and to dorothi explain hi long silenc as best
he could the latter too he for the first time took into hi
confid about eva at a distanc he no longer felt the same shyness
in speak to her about anoth woman that had overpow him when
he wa by her side
now that he had been awai from england for a year or so mani thing
connect with hi home life had grown rather faint amid the daili
chang and activ of hi new life the rush of fresh impress had
to a great extent overlaid the old on and dorothi and mr cardu
and all the old kesterwick exist and surround seem faint and
far awai thei were inde rapidli assum that unreal which in
time the wander find will gather round hi old associ he
feel that thei know him no more veri like he imagin that thei
have forgotten him and so thei becom like the shade of the dead it
is almost a shock to such an on to come back and find after an
absenc of mani year that though he ha been live hi rapid
vigor life and store hi time with mani act good bad and
indiffer though he think that he ha chang so complet and
develop greatli in on direct or anoth yet the old spot the
old familiar surround and the old dear face have chang hardli
on whit thei have been live their quiet english life in which
sensat incid and excit ar thing unfamiliar and have
vari not at all
most peopl as a matter of fact chang veri littl except in so far
as thei ar influenc by the cyclic variat of their life the
passag from youth to matur and from matur to ag and the
attend mode of thought and action befit each period but even
then the chang is superfici rather than real what the child is
that the middleag person and the old man will be also the reason
of thi appear to be suffici obviou the unchang person
that grow not old the anim spiritu ego is there and
practic ident at all period of life the bodi the brain and
the subtler intellect mai all vari accord to the circumst
mostli physic of person exist but the effect that the
passag of a few year more or less activ or stormi can produc
upon a principl so indestruct so immeasur ancient and the
inheritor of so farreach a destini as some of us believ the
individu human soul to be sure must be small
alreadi ernest began to find it someth of a labour to indit
epistl to peopl in england and yet he had the pen of a readi
writer the link that bound them togeth were fast break loos
eva and eva alon remain clear and real to the vision of hi mind
she wa alwai with him and to her at ani period of hi life he
never found difficulti in write for in truth their veri natur
were interwoven and the rapport between them wa not produc mere
by the pressur of extern circumst or by the fact of continu
contact and mutual attract aris from physic caus such as
the natur lean of youth to youth and beauti to beauti
these caus accord to ernest creed no doubt had to do with
it product and perhap were necessari to it mundan birth as
the batteri is necessari to the creation of the electr spark thu
had eva been old instead of a young and love girl the rapport
would perhap never have come into be here in short thei form
the cabl along which the occult commun could pass but there
their function end have onc establish that commun and
provid a mean by which the fusion of spirit could be effect
youth and beauti and the natur attract of sex to sex had done
their part the great divid river that roll so fast and wide
between our soul in their human shape had been safe pass and the
two fortun travel had been allow befor their time to reap
advantagesth measureless advantag of real love so rare on earth
and at it best so stain by passion which will onli come to most of
us and then perhap imperfectli in a differ world from thi
ye the bridg might now be broken down it had serv it purpos
come ag or loss of physic attract or separ and ici
silenc or the chang call death itself and the soul thu subtli
blend can and will and do defi them for the real life is not here
here onli is the blind begin of thing mayb the prematur
begin
and so ernest post hi letter and then partli to emploi hi
thought and partli becaus it wa hi natur to throw himself into
whatev stream of life wa flow past him he set himself to master
the state of polit affair in the countri in which he found
himself
thi need not be enter into here further than to sai that it wa
such as might with advantag have emploi wiser head than hi and
inde did emploi them suffic it to sai that he contriv to make
himself of consider us to the english parti both befor and
after the annex of the transvaal to the dominion of the crown
among other thing he went on sever mission in conjunct with mr
alston with a view of ascertain the real state of feel among
the boer also togeth with jeremi he join a volunt corp
which wa organis for the defenc of pretoria when it wa still a
matter of doubt whether or not the contempl annex would or
would not result in an attack be made upon the town by the boer
it wa a most excit time and onc or twice ernest and jeremi had
narrow escap of be murder howev noth worthi of note
happen to them and at last the longexpect annex came off
successfulli to the intens joi of all the englishmen in the countri
and to the great relief of the vast major of the boer
now togeth with the proclam by which the transvaal wa annex
to her majesti dominion wa issu anoth that wa to have a
consider bear upon ernest fortun thi wa none other than
a promis of her majesti graciou pardon to all such as had been
resid in the transvaal for a period of six month previou to the
date of annex be former british subject and offend
against the english crimin law who would regist their name and
offenc within a given time the object of thi proclam wa to
give immun from prosecut to mani individu former desert
from the english armi and other peopl who had in some wai
transgress the law but were now occupi respect posit in
their adopt countri
mr alston read thi proclam attent when it came out in a
special number of the gazett then after think for a while he
hand it to ernest
you have read thi amnesti proclam he said
ye answer ernest what of it

when thi preciou document wa in hi pocket ernest thought that he

slave unexpectedli manumit had it not been for thi fortun
accid the consequ of that fatal duel must have continu
overshadow him had he return to england he would have been
liabl at ani period of hi life to a prosecut for murder inde
the arm of the law is long and he live in continu apprehens of
an applic for hi extradit be made to the author of
whatev countri he wa in but now all thi wa gone from him and he
felt that he would not be afraid to have word with an
attorneygener or shudder ani more at the sight of a policeman
hi first idea on get hi pardon wa to return straightwai to
england but that silent fate which direct men live drive them
whither thei would not and forc their bare and bleed feet to
stumbl along the stoni path of it hidden purpos came into hi
mind and made him see that it would be better to delai a while in a
few week eva answer would sure reach him if he were to go now
it wa even possibl that he might pass her in midocean for in hi
heart he never doubt but that she would come
and inde the veri next mail there came a letter from dorothi
written in answer to that which he had post on the same dai that he
had written to eva it wa onli a short letterth last post that
could catch the mail wa just go out and hi welcom letter had

safe and reproach him gentli for not write then she thank him
for make her hi confidant about eva ceswick she had guess it
long befor she said and she thought thei were both lucki in each
other and hope and prai that when the time came thei would be as
complet happi as it wa possibl for peopl to be she had never
spoken to eva about him but she should no longer feel ani diffid
in do so now she should go and see her veri soon and plead hi
caus not that it want ani plead howev she wa sure of that
eva look sad now that he wa gone there had been some talk a while
back of mr plowden the new clergyman but she suppos that eva had
given him hi quietu as she heard no more of it now and so on till
the postman is at the door wait for thi letter
littl did ernest guess what it cost poor dorothi to write her
congratul and wish of happi a manth nobler anim
remembercould hardli have done it onli the inferior woman would
show such unselfish
thi letter fill ernest with a sure and certain hope eva he
clearli saw had not had time to write by that mail by the next her
answer would come it can be imagin that he wait for it advent
with some anxieti

individu and from that dai forward for mani year he wa
hand over to a longdrawnout pain which never quit ceas though
it frequent culmin in paroxysm and to which death itself would
have been almost prefer

wa an intens and savag thirst for reveng so intens inde that
he felt as though he must put himself in a wai to gratifi it or hi
brain would go tomorrow he thought wa to see the final act of hi
betray todai wa the ev of her marriag and he as powerless to
avert it as a child o great god and yet through it all he knew she

occur to prevent rare inde is it that the plowden of thi world
ar prevent from marri the eva fate ha suffici to do in
thwart the ernest and meanwhil her posit wa not altogeth
unendur for she had made a bargain with her lover that the usual
amen of courtship were to be dispens with there were to be no
embrac or other tender passag she wa not even to be forc to
call him jame jame how she detest the name thu did the
wretch girl try to put off the evil dai much as the ostrich is
suppos to hide her head in a bush and indulg in dream of fanci
secur mr plowden did not object he wa too wari a hunter to do
so while hi state prei wa there with her head in the thickest of
the bush he wa sure of her she would never wake from her foolish
dream till the ripe moment came to deliv the fatal blow and all
would be over but if on the contrari he startl her now she might
take flight more swiftli than he could follow and leav him alon in
the desert
so when eva made her littl stipul he acquiesc in them after
onli just so much hesit as he thought would seem loverlik
life eva he said sententi is a compromis i yield to your
wish but in hi heart he thought that a time would come when she
would have to yield to him and hi cold ey gleam eva saw the
gleam and shudder prophet
the reverend mr plowden did not suffer much distress at the cold
with which he wa treat he knew that hi dai would come and wa
content to wait for it like a wise man he wa not in love with eva a
natur like hi is scarc capabl of ani such feel as that for
instanc which eva and ernest bore to each other true love crown
with immort veil hi shine face from such men as mr plowden
he wa fascin by her beauti that wa all but hi cun wa of
a superior order and he wa quit content to wait so he contriv to
extract a letter from eva in which she talk of our engag
and allud to our forthcom marriag and wait

curs the fellow impud said the clergyman furious if he
were here i would give him a bit of my mind
eva spirit rose and she turn on him with flash ey look
like a queen in her imperi beauti
if he were here mr plowden you would not dare to look him in the
face men like you onli take advantag of the absent
the clergyman ground hi teeth he felt hi furiou temper rise and
did not dare to answer though he wa a bold man in face of a woman
he fear lest it should get beyond him but beneath hi breath he
mutter you shall pai for that my ladi
under these circumst went on eva i appeal to you as a
gentleman to releas me from an engag into which as you know i
have been drawn more by forc of circumst than by my own wish

year you love her as wildli as you did the dai when she first

mr cardu had risen and wa look through the glass door at the

of duti prevent her from accept the offer
then dorothi felt that she had done all that in her lai and gave the
matter up
it wa about thi time that florenc drew anoth pictur it

chapter xv
hanss citi of rest
mr alston ernest and jeremi had veri good sport among the
eleph kill in all nineteen bull it wa dure thi
expedit that an incid occur which in it effect endear
ernest to mr alston more than ever
the boi roger who alwai went wherev mr alston went wa the
object of hi father most tender solicitud he believ in the boi
as he believ in littl els in the worldfor at heart mr alston
wa a sad cynicand to a certain extent the boi justifi hi belief
he wa quick intellig and plucki much such a boi as you mai pick
up by the dozen out of ani english public school except that hi
knowledg of men and manner wa more develop as is usual among
young colonist at the ag of twelv master roger alston knew mani
thing deni to most children of hi ag on the subject of educ
mr alston had queer idea the best educ for a boi he would
sai is to mix with grownup gentlemen if you send him to school he
learn littl except mischief if you let him live with gentlemen he
learn at ani rate to be a gentleman
but whatev master roger knew he did not know much about eleph
and on thi point he wa destin to gain some experi
on dayit wa just after thei had got into the eleph
countrythei were all engag in follow the fresh spoor of a
solitari bull but though an eleph is a big beast it is hard work
catch him up becaus he never seem to get tire and thi wa
exactli what our parti of hunter found thei follow that energet
eleph for hour but thei could not catch him though the spoorer
told them that he wa certainli not more than a mile or so ahead at
last the sun began to get low and their leg had alreadi grown weari
so thei gave it up for that dai determin to camp where thei were
thi be so after a rest ernest and the boi roger start out of
camp to see if thei could not shoot a buck or some bird for supper
roger had a repeat winchest carbin ernest a doublebarrel
shotgun hardli had thei left the camp when aasvgel jeremi
hottentot came run in and report that he had seen the
eleph an enorm bull with a white spot upon hi trunk feed
in a clump of mimosa not a quarter of a mile awai up jump mr
alston and jeremi as fresh as though thei had not walk a mile and
seiz their doubleeight eleph rifl start off with aasvgel
meanwhil ernest and roger had been stroll toward thi ident
clump of mimosa as thei near it the former saw some guineafowl
run into the shelter of the tree
capit he said guineafowl ar firstclass eat now roger
just you go into the bush and drive the flock over me ill stand
here and make believ thei ar pheasant
the lad did as he wa bid but in order to get well behind the covei
of guineafowl which ar dread thing to run he made a littl
circuit through the thickest part of the clump as he did so hi quick
ey wa arrest by a most unusu perform on the part of on of
the flatcrown mimosatre suddenli and without the slightest
appar reason it rose into the air and then behold where it
crown had been a moment befor appear it root
such an alic in wonderland sort of perform on the part of a
tree could not but excit the curios of an intellig youth
accordingli roger push forward and slip round an interven
tree thi wa what he saw in a littl glade about ten pace from
him flap it ear stood an enorm eleph with great white
tusk look as larg as a hous and as cool as a cucumb nobodi
to look at the brute would have believ that he had given them a
twenti mile trot under a burn sun he wa now refresh himself
by pull up mimosatre as easili as though thei were radish and
eat the sweet fibrou root
roger saw thi and hi heart burn with ambit to kill that
elephantth mighti great beast about a hundr time as big as
himself who could pull up a larg tree and make hi dinner off the
root roger wa a plucki boi and in hi sportsmanlik zeal he
quit forgot that a repeat carbin is not exactli the weapon on
would choos to shoot eleph with inde without give the
matter anoth thought he lift the littl rifl aim it at the
great beast head and fire he hit it somewher that wa veri
clear for next moment the air resound with the most terrif scream
of furi that it had ever been hi lot to hear that scream wa too
much for him he turn and fled swiftli eleph were evid
difficult thing to kill
fortun for roger the eleph could not for some second make
out where hi tini assail wa present howev he wind him
and came crash after him scream shrilli with hi trunk and
tail well up on hear the shot and the scream of the eleph
ernest who wa stand some wai out in the open in anticip of
a drive shot of the guineafowl had run toward the spot where
roger had enter the bush and just as he got opposit to it out he
came scuttl along for hi life with the eleph not more than
twenti pace behind him
then ernest did a brave thing
make for the bush he yell to the boi who at onc swerv to the
right on thunder the eleph straight toward ernest but with
ernest it wa evid that he consid he had no quarrel for
present he tri to swing himself round after roger then ernest
lift hi shotgun and sent a charg of no 4 into the brute face
sting him sadli it wa humanli speak certain death which he
court but at the moment hi main idea wa to save the boi
scream afresh the eleph abandon the pursuit of roger and
made straight for ernest who fire the other barrel of smallshot in
the vain hope of blind him by now the boi had pull up be
some forti yard off and see ernest just about to be crumpl up
wildli fire the repeat rifl in their direct some good angel
must have guid the littl bullet for as it happen it struck the
eleph in the region of the knee and forc it wai in slightli
injur a tendon and brought the great beast thunder to the
ground ernest had onli just time to dodg to on side as the huge
mass came to the earth inde as it wa he got a tap from the tip
of the eleph trunk which knock him down and though he did not
feel it at the time made him sore for dai afterward in a moment
howev he wa up again and awai at hi best speed leg it as he
had never leg it befor in hi life and so wa the eleph
peopl have no idea at what a pace an eleph can go when he is out
of temper until thei put it to the proof had it not been the slight
injuri to the knee and the twentyyard start he got ernest would
have been repres by littl piec befor he wa ten second
older as it wa when a hundr and fifti yard farther on eleph
and ernest broke upon the astonish view of mr alston and jeremi
who were hurri up to the scene of action thei were almost on
flesh that is the tip of the eleph trunk wa now up in the air
and now about six inch off the seat of ernest trouser at which
it snap convuls
up went jeremi rifl which luckili he had in hi hand
behind the shoulder halfwai down the ear said mr alston
beckon to a kafir to bring hi rifl which he wa carri the
probabl of jeremi stop the beast at that distancethei were
quit sixti yard offwa infinitesim
there wa a second paus the snap tip touch the retreat
trouser but did not get hold of them and the contact sent a
magnet thrill up ernest back
boomthudcrash and the eleph wa down dead as a doornail
jeremi had made no mistak the bullet went straight through the great
brute heart and broke the shoulder on the other side he wa on of
those men who not onli rare miss but alwai seem to hit their game
in the right place
ernest sank exhaust on the ground and mr alston and jeremi rush
up rejoic
near go that ernest said the former
ernest nod in repli he could not speak
by jove where is roger he went on turn pale as he miss hi
son for the first time
but at thi moment that young gentleman hove in sight and recov
from hi fright when he saw that the great anim wa stonedead
rush up with yell of exult and climb on to the upper
tusk began to point out where he had hit him
meanwhil mr alston had extract the stori of the adventur from
ernest
you young rascal he said to hi son come off that tusk do you
know that if it had not been for mr kershaw here who court almost
certain death to save you from the result of your own folli you
would be as dead as that eleph and as flat as a biscuit come down
sir and offer up your thank to provid and mr kershaw that you
have a sound squar inch of skin left on your worthless young bodi
roger descend accordingli consider crestfallen
never you mind roger that wa a most rattl good shot of your at
hi knee said ernest who had now got hi breath back again you
would not do it again if you fire at eleph for a week
and so the matter pass off but afterward mr alston thank ernest
with tear in hi ey for save hi son life
thi wa the first eleph thei kill and also the largest it
measur ten feet eleven inch at the shoulder and the tusk
weigh when dri out about sixti pound each
thei remain in the eleph countri for nearli four month when the
approach of the unhealthi season forc them to leav itnot
howev befor thei had kill a great quantiti of larg game of all
sort it wa a most success hunt so success inde that the
ivori thei brought down paid all the expens of the trip and left a
handsom surplu over
it wa on the occas of their return to pretoria that ernest made
the acquaint of a curiou charact in a curiou wai
as soon as thei reach the boundari of the transvaal ernest bought
a hors from a boer on which he us to ride after the herd of buck
which swarm upon the high veld thei had none with them becaus in
the countri where thei had been shoot no hors would live on dai
as thei were travel slowli along a littl befor middai a coupl
of bullvilderbeest gallop across the waggontrack about two
hundr yard in front of the oxen the voorloop stop the oxen in
order to give ernest who wa sit on the waggonbox with a rifl
by hi side a steadi shot ernest fire at the last of the two
gallop bull the line wa good but he did not make suffici
allow for the pace at which the bull wa travel with the
result that instead of strike it forward and kill it the bullet
shatter it flank and did not stop it career
dash it said ernest when he saw what he had done i cant leav
the poor beast like that bring me my hors i will go after him and
finish him
the hors which wa ti alreadi saddl behind the waggon wa
quickli brought and ernest mount told them not to keep the
waggon for him as he would strike across countri and meet them at
the outspan place about a mile or so on then he start after hi
wound bull which could be plainli discern stand with on leg
up on the crest of a rise about a thousand yard awai but if ever a
vilderbeest wa possess by a fix determin not to be finish
off it wa that particular vilderbeest the pace at which a
vilderbeest can travel on three leg when he is not too fat is
perfectli astonish and ernest had travers a coupl of mile of
great roll plain befor he even got within fair gallop distanc
of him
he had a good hors howev and at last he got within fifti yard
and then awai thei went at a merri pace ernest object be to ride
alongsid and put a bullet through him their gallop last a good two
mile or more on the level ernest gain on the vilderbeest but
whenev thei came to a patch of antbear hole or a ridg of stone
the vilderbeest had the pull and drew awai again at last thei came
to a dry pan or lake about half a mile broad crowd with hundr of
buck of all sort which scamper awai as thei came tear along
here ernest at length drew up level with hi quarri and grasp the
rifl with hi right hand tri to get it so that he could put a
bullet through the beast and drop him but it wa no easi matter as
ani on who ha ever tri it will know and while he wa still
make up hi mind the vilderbeest slew round and came at him
brave had hi hors been unus to the work he must have had hi
insid rip out by the crook horn but he wa an old hunter and
equal to the occas to turn wa imposs the speed wa too
great but he manag to slew with the result that the charg
anim brush hi head instead of land himself in hi belli at
the same moment ernest stretch out hi rifl and pull the trigger
and as it chanc put the bullet right through the vilderbeest and
drop him dead
then he pull up and dismount cut off some of the best of beef
with hi huntingknif stow it awai in a saddlebag and set off on
hi hors now pretti well fag to find the waggon but to find a
waggontrack on the great veld unless you have in the first instanc
taken the most care bear is almost as difficult as it would be
to return from a distanc to ani given spot on the ocean without a
compass there ar no tree or hill to guid the travel noth
but a vast wilder of land resembl a sea petrifi in a heavi
swell
ernest rode on for three or four mile as he thought retrac hi
step over the line of countri he had travers and at last to hi
joi struck the path there were waggontrack on it but he thought
thei did not look quit fresh howev he follow them faut de
mieux for some five mile then he becam convinc that thei could
not have been made by hi waggon he had overshot the mark and must
hark back so he turn hi weari hors head and made hi wai along
the road to the spot where hi spoor struck into it the waggon must
be outspan wait for him a littl farther back he went on on
mile two threeno waggon a littl to the left of the road wa an
emin he rode to it and up and scan the horizon o joi there
far awai five or six mile off wa the white cap of a waggon he
rode to it straight across countri onc he got bog in a vlei or
swamp and had to throw himself off and drag hi hors out by the
bridl he struggl on and at last came to the dip in which he had
seen the waggont it wa a great white stone perch on a mound of
brown on
by thi time he had utterli lost hi reckon just then to make
matter wors a thundershow came up with a bitter wind and
drench him to the skin the rain pass but the wind did not it
blew like ic and chill hi frame enerv with the tropic heat
in which he had been live through and through he wander on
aimlessli till suddenli hi tire hors put hi foot in a hole and
fell heavili throw him on to hi head and shoulder for a few
minut hi sens left him but he recov and mount hi
wornout hors wander on again luckili he had broken no bone
had he done so he would probabl have perish miser in that
lone place
the sun wa sink now and he wa faint for want of food for he had
eaten noth that dai but a biscuit he had not even a pipe of
tobacco with him just as the sun vanish he hit a littl path or
what might onc have been a path he follow it till the pitchi
dark set in then he got off hi hors and took off the saddl
which he put down on the bare black veld for a fire had recent
swept off the dry grass and wrap the saddlecloth round hi feet
laid hi ach head upon the saddl the rein he hitch round hi
arm lest the hors should strai awai from him to look for food the
wind wa bitterli cold and he wa wet through the hyena came and
howl at him he cut off a piec of the raw vilderbeestebeef and
chew it but it turn hi stomach and he spat it out then he
shiver and sank into a torpor from which there wa a poor chanc of
hi awaken
how long he lai so he did not knowit seem a few minut it wa
realli an hourwhen suddenli he wa awaken by feel someth
shake him by the shoulder
what is it he said wearili
wat is it ach himmel wat is it dat is just wat i want to know
wat do you here you shall die so
the voic wa the voic of a german and ernest knew german well
i have lost my wai he said in that languag i cannot find the
waggon
ah you can speak the tongu of the vaterland said hi visitor
still address him in english i will embrac you and he did so
ernest sigh it is a bore to be embrac in the dark by an unknown
male german when you feel that you ar not far off dissolut
you ar hunger said the german
ernest signifi that he wa
and athirst
again he signifi assent
and perhap you have no gui tobacco
no none
good my littl wife my wilhelmina shall find you all these
thing
what the devil thought ernest to himself can a german be do
with hi littl wife in thi place
by thi time the star had come out and gave some light
come rous yourself and come and see my littl wife o the pferd
horsew will tie him to my wife ah she is beauti though her
leg shake o ye you will love her
the deuc i shall ejacul ernest and then mind of the good
thing the ladi in question wa to provid him with he ad
solemnli lead on macduff
macduff my name is not so my name is han all ze great south
africa know me veri well and all south africa love my wife
realli said ernest
although he wa so miser he began to feel that the situat wa
interest a ladi to whom hi hors wa to be ti and whom all
south africa wa enamour of could hardli fail to be interest
rise he advanc a step or two with hi friend who he could now
see wa a larg burli man with white hair appar about sixti
year of ag present thei came to someth that in the dim light
remind him of the handhears in kesterwick church onli it had two
wheel instead of four and no spring
behold my beauti wife said the german soon i will show you how
her leg shake it shake o horrid
isi the ladi insid ask ernest it occur to him that hi
friend might be cart about a corps

german put hi head on on side in a most comic fashion and
regard the unoffici hears with the deepest affect said in a
low voic ah lieb vrouw ah wilhelmina is you tire my dear
and how is your poor leg and he caught hold of a groggi wheel and
shook it
had ernest been a littl less wretch and on degre further off
starvat it is probabl that he would have explod with laughter
for he had a keen sens of the ludicr but he had not got a laugh
left in him and besid he wa afraid of offend the german so
he mere murmur poor poor leg sympathet and then
allud to the question of eatabl
ah ye of cours let us see what wilhelmina shall give us and he
trot round to the back end of the cart which in keep with it
hearselik charact open by mean of two littl foldingdoor
and pull out first two blanket on of which he gave to ernest to
put round hi shoulder second a larg piec of biltong or
sundri game flesh and some biscuit and third a bottl of
peachbrandi on these viand thei fell to and though thei were not
in themselv of an appetis natur ernest never enjoi anyth
more in hi life their meal did not take veri long and after it hi
friend han produc some excel boer tobacco and over their pipe
ernest told him how he had lost hi wai han ask him what road he
had been travel on
the rustenburg road
then my friend you ar not more than on thousand pace off it my
wife and i we travel along him all dai till just now wilhelmina she
think she would like to come up here and so i come and now you see
the reason why she know you lie here and die in the cold and she
turn up to save your life ah the good woman
ernest wa greatli reliev to hear that he wa so near the road as
onc upon it he would have no difficulti in fall in with the
waggon clearli dure the latter part of hi wander he must
have unknowingli approach it hi mind reliev upon thi point
wa at liberti to satisfi it curios about hi friend he soon
discov that he wa a harmless lunat whose craze it wa to
wander all over south africa drag hi handcart after him he
made no fix point nor had he ani settl round the begin of
the year might find him near the zambesi and the end near cape town
or anywher els by the nativ he wa look upon as inspir and
invari treat with respect and he live upon what wa given to
him or what he shot as he walk along thi mode of life he had
pursu for year and though he had mani adventur he never came to
harm
you see my friend said the simpl man in answer to ernest
inquiri i make my wife down there in scatterdorp in the old
coloni the hous ar a long wai off each other there and the church
it is in the middl and the good volk there thei die veri fast and
did get tire of carri each other to be buri and so thei come to
me and sai han you ar a carpent you must make a beauti
black cart to put us in when we die and so i set to and i work and
work and work at my cart till i get quitewhat do you call
himstoopid and then on night just as my cart wa finish i
dream that she and i ar travel along a wide straight road like
the road on the high veld and i know that she is my wife and that
we must travel alwai togeth till we reach the citi of rest and
far far awai abov the top of a high mountain like the drakensberg
i see a great wide tree root on a cloud and cover all over with
beauti snow that shine in the sunlight like the diamond at
kimberlei and i know that under that tree is the gate of the real
rustenburg the citi of rest and my wife and i we must journei on
on on till we find it
where do you come from now
from utrecht from out of the east where the sun rise so red everi
morn over zululand the land of bloodsh o the land will run
with blood there i know it wilhelmina told me as we came along but
i dont know when but you ar tire good you shall sleep with
wilhelmina i will sleep beneath her no you shall or she will
bewhat you call himoffend
ernest crept into the caviti and at onc fell asleep and dream
that he had been buri aliv suddenli in the middl of the night
there wa a most fear jolt caus by hi hors which wa ti to
the pole of wilhelmina have pull the prop asid and let the pole
down with a run thi ernest mistook for the resurrect and wa
extrem reliev to find himself in error at dawn he emerg bade
hi friend farewel and gain the road rejoin the waggon in
safeti
chapter xvi
ernest accept a commiss
a young man of that ardent impetu intellig mind which make
him charm and a thing to love as contrast with the young man of
the sober cautiou moneymak mind infinit the more us
articl which make him a comfort to hi rel and a thing to
respect avoid and marri your daughter to ha two great safeguard
stand between him and the ruin which dog the heel of the ardent
the impetu and the intellig these ar hi religion and hi
belief in women it is probabl that he will start on hi errat
career with a full store of both he ha never question the former
the latter so far as hi own class in life is concern ar to him
all sweet and good and perhap there is on particular star who onli
shine for him and is the sweetest and best of them all
but on dai the sweetest and best of all throw him over be a
younger son and marri hi eldest brother or a paralyt
cottonspinn of enorm wealth and uncertain temper and then a
sudden chang come over the spirit of the ardent intellig and
impetu on not be of a wellbalanc mind he rush to the
other extrem and believ in hi sore heart that all women would
throw over such as he and marri eldest brother or superannu
cottonspinn he mai be right or he mai be wrong the materi for
ascertain the fact ar want for all women engag to
impecuni young gentlemen to not get the chanc but right or
wrong the result upon the suffer is the samehi faith in women is
shaken if not destroi nor doe the mischief stop there hi
religion often follow hi belief in the other sex for in some
mysteri wai the two thing ar interwoven a young man of the
nobler class of mind in love is gener for the time be a
religi man hi affect lift him more or less abov the thing
of earth and float him on it radiant wing a dai journei nearer
heaven
the same thing appli convers if a man religi belief is
emascul he becom suspici of the sweetest and best he
grow cynic and no longer put faith in superl from atheism
there is but a small step to misogyni or rather to that disbelief in
human which embrac a profound constitu disbelief in it
feminin section and in turn as alreadi said the misogynist walk
daili along the edg of atheism of cours there is a wai out of these
discourag result if the mind that suffer and fall through it
suffer be of the truli nobl order it mai in time come to see that
thi world is a world not of superl but of the most arid
posit with here and there a littl compar oasi to break the
monotoni of it gener outlin it owner mai learn that the fault
lai with him for believ too much for trust too far for
set up as an idol a creatur exactli like himself onli sever
degre lower beneath proof and at last he mai come to see that
though sweetest and best ar chimer there ar women in the
world who mai fairli be call sweet and good
or to return to the convers side of the pictur it mai occur to our
young gentleman that although provid start us in the world with a
full inherit or indoctrin belief in a given religion that is
not what provid understand by faith faith perfect faith is
onli to be won by struggl and in most cultiv mind by the
passag through the dim mirageclad land of disbelief the true
believ is he who ha trodden down disbelief not he who ha run awai
from it when we have descend from the height of our childhood when
we have entertain apollyon and have consid what he ha to
sai given him battl and rout him in the plain then and not till
then can we sai with guileless heart lord i believ and feel no
need to add the sadli qualifi word help thou mine unbelief
now these ar more or less principl of human natur thei mai not be
univers true probabl noth isthat is as we defin and
understand truth but thei appli to the major of those case which
fall strictli within their limit among other thei appli rather
strikingli to ernest kershaw eva desert struck hi belief in
womanhood to the ground and soon hi religion lai in the dust besid
it of thi hi life for some year after that event gave consider
evid he took to evil wai he forgot hi better self he race
hors he devot himself with great success to loveaffair that he
would have done better to leav alon sometim to hi shame be it
said he drankfor the excit of drink not for the love of
it in short he gave himself and all hi fund of energi up to ani and
everi excit and dissip he could command and he manag to
command a good mani travel rapidli from place to place in south
africa he wa well known and well like in all now he wa at
kimberlei now at king william town now at durban in each of these
place he kept racehors in each there wa some fair woman face
that grew the brighter for hi come
but ernest face did not grow brighter on the contrari hi ey
acquir a peculiar sad which wa almost pathet in on so young
he could not forget for a few dai or a few month he might stifl
thought but it alwai reros eva pale queen of women wa ever
there to haunt hi sleep and though in hi wake hour he might
curs her memori when night drew the veil from truth the word he
murmur were word of love etern
he no longer prai he no longer reverenc woman but he wa not the
happier for have freed hi soul from these burden he despis
himself occasion he would take stock of hi mental condit and
at each stocktak he would notic that he had reced not
progress he wa grow coars hi finer sens wa be blunt
he wa no longer the same ernest who had written that queer letter to
hi betroth befor disast overwhelm him slowli and sure he
wa sink he knew it but he did not try to save himself why
should he he had no object in life but at time a great depress
and weari of exist would take possess of him it ha been
said that he never prai that is not strictli true onc or twice he
did throw himself upon hi knee and prai with all hi strength that
he might die he did more he persist court death and as is
usual in such case it persist avoid him about take hi own
life he had scrupl or perhap he would have taken it in those dark
dai he hate life and in hi calmer and more reflect moment he
loath the pleasur and excit by mean of which he strove to
make it palat hi wa a fine strung mind and in spite of
himself he shudder when it wa set to plai such coars music
dure those year ernest seem to bear a charm exist there
wa a wellknown thoroughbr hors in the transvaal which had kill
two men in rapid success ernest bought it and rode it and it
never hurt him disturb broke out in secocoeni countri and on
of the chief stronghold wa order to be storm ernest rode down
from pretoria with jeremi to see the fun and reach the fort the
dai befor the attack got leav to join the storm parti
accordingli next dai at dawn thei attack in the teeth of a furiou
fusillad and in time took the place though with veri heavi loss to
themselv jeremi hat wa shot off with on bullet and hi hand cut
by anoth ernest as usual came off scathless the man next to him
wa kill but he wa not touch after that he insist upon go
buffaloshoot toward delagoa bai in the height of the
feverseason have got rid of jeremi by persuad him to go to new
scotland to see about a tract of land thei had bought he start with
a dozen bearer and mazooku six week later he mazooku and three

on anoth occas alston jeremi and himself were sent on a
polit mission to a hostil chief whose stronghold lai in the
heart of almost inaccess mountain the indaba palav took
all dai and wa purpos prolong in order to enabl the
intellig nativ to set an ambush in the pass through which the
white chief must go back with strict instruct to murder all
three of them when thei left the stronghold the moon wa rise and
as thei near the pass up she came behind the mountain in all her
splendour flood the wide vallei behind them with her mysteri
light and throw a pale sad lustr on everi stone and tree on
thei rode steadili through the moonlight and the silenc littl
guess how near death wa to them the faint beauti of the scene
sank deep into ernest heart and present when thei came to a spot
where a track ran out loopwis from the main pass return to it a
coupl of mile farther on he half insist on their take it
becaus it pass over yet higher ground and would give them a better
view of the moonbath vallei mr alston grumbl at hi nonsens
and compli and meanwhil a parti of murder half a mile farther
on plai with their assegai and wonder why thei did not hear the
sound of the white men feet but the white men had alreadi pass
along the higher path threequart of a mile to their right
ernest love of moonlight effect had save them all from a certain
and perhap from a linger death
it wa shortli after thi incid that ernest and jeremi were seat

chapter xvii
han prophesi evil
ernest and jeremi did not let the grass grow under their feet thei
guess that there would soon be a good deal of recruit for variou
corp and so set to work at onc to secur the best men the stamp of
man thei aim at get wa the colonialborn englishman both
becaus such men have more selfrespect independ of charact
and gumption than the ordinari drift sediment from the diamond
field and seaport and also becaus thei were practic readymad
soldier thei could ride as well as thei could walk thei were
splendid rifleshot and thei had too from childhood been train
in the art of travel without baggag and veri rapidli
ernest did not find much difficulti in the task mr alston wa well
known and had seen a great deal of servic as a young man in the
basuto war and stori were still told of hi nerv and pluck he
wa known too to be a wari man not rash or overconfid but of a
determin mind and what is more to possess a perfect knowledg of
zulu warfar and tactic thi went a long wai with intend
recruit for the first thing a wouldb coloni volunt inquir
into is the charact of hi offic he will not trust hi life to
men in whom he put no relianc he is will to lose it in the wai
of duti but he ha a great object to have it blunder awai
inde in mani south african volunt corp it is a fundament
principl that the offic should be elect by the men themselv
onc elect howev thei cannot be depos except by compet
author
ernest too wa by thi time well known in the transvaal and
univers believ in mr alston could not have chosen a better
lieuten he wa known to have pluck and dash and to be
readywit in emerg but it wa not those qualiti onli which
made him accept to the individu whose continu exist would
veri possibl depend upon hi courag and discret inde it would
be difficult to sai what it wa but there ar some men who ar by
natur born leader of their fellow and who inspir confid
magnet ernest had thi great gift at first sight he wa much
like ani other young man rather carelesslook than otherwis in
appear and give the observ the impress that he wa
think of someth els but old hand at nativ warfar look
into hi dark ey saw someth there which told them that thi
young fellow boi as he wa compar speak would not show
himself want in the moment of emerg either in courag or
discret jeremi nomin too as sergeantmajor a veri
import post in such a corp wa popular enough peopl had not
forgotten hi victori over the boer giant and besid a
sergeantmajor with such a physiqu would have been a credit to ani
corp
all these thing help to make recruit an easi task and when
alston and hi son roger weari and bruis step out of the natal
postcart four dai later it wa to be met by ernest and jeremi with
the intellig that hi telegram had been receiv the appoint
accept and thirtyf men provision enrol subject to hi
approv
my word young gentlemen he said highli pleas you ar
lieuten worth have
the next fortnight wa a busi on for all concern the organis
of a coloni volunt corp is no joke as anybodi who ha ever
tri it can testifi there were rough uniform to be provid arm

in three week from the dai thei got their hors there wa not a
smarter quicker corp in south africa and mr alston and ernest were
highli compliment on the soldierlik appear of the men and the
rapid and exactitud with which thei execut all the ordinari
cavalri manoeuvr
thei were to march from pretoria on the 10th of januari and expect
to overtak colonel glynn column with which wa the gener about
the 18th by which time mr alston calcul the real advanc upon
zululand would begin
on the 8th the good peopl of pretoria gave the corp a farewel
banquet for most of it member were pretoria men and colonist ar
never behindhand when there is an excus for convivi and
goodfellowship
of cours after the banquet mror as he wa now call
captainalston health wa drunk but alston wa a man of few word
and had a horror of speechmak he content himself with a few
brief sentenc of acknowledg and sat down then somebodi propos
the health of the other commiss and noncommiss offic
and to thi ernest rose to respond make a veri good speech in
repli he rapidli sketch the state of polit affair of which
the zulu war wa the outcom and without ani opinion on the justic
or wisdom of that war of which to speak the truth he had grave
doubt he went on to show in a few wellchosen weighti word how
vital were the interest involv in it success conclus now
that it onc had been undertaken final he conclud thu
i am well awar gentlemen that with mani of those who ar your
guest here tonight and my own comrad thi state of affair and
the convict of the extrem urgenc of the occas ha been the
caus of their enlist it is imposs for me to look down these
tabl and see so mani in our roughandreadi uniform whom i have
known in other walk of life as farmer storekeep govern
clerk and what not without realis most clearli the extrem
necess that can have brought these peaceabl citizen togeth on
such an errand as we ar bent on certainli it is not the ten
shill a dai or the mere excit of savag warfar that ha
done thi cri of no no becaus most of them can well afford
to despis the monei and mani more have seen enough of nativ war
and know well that few reward and plenti of hard work fall to the lot
of coloni volunt then what is it i will ventur to repli it
is that sens of patriot which is a part and parcel of the english
mind cheer and which from gener to gener ha been the
root of england great and so long as the british blood remain
untaint will from unborn gener to gener be the mainspr
of the great that is yet to be of those wider england of which i
hope thi contin will becom not the least loud cheer
that gentlemen and men of alston hors is the bond which unit
us togeth it is the sens of a common duti to perform of a common
danger to combat of a common patriot to vindic and for that
reason becaus of the patriot and the duti i feel sure that when
the end of thi campaign come whatev that end mai be no on be
he imperi offic or newspap correspond or zulu foe will be
abl to sai that alston hors shirk it work or wa mutin or
prove a broken reed pierc the side of those who lean on it
cheer i feel sure too that though there mai be a record of
brave deed such as becom brave men there will be none of a comrad
desert in the time of need or of a failur in the moment of
emerg my brethren in arm and here ernest ey flash and
hi strong clear voic went ring down the great hall whom england
ha call and who have not fail to answer the call i repeat
howev terribl mai be that emerg even if it should involv the
certainti of deathi speak thu becaus i feel i am address brave
men who do not fear to die when death mean duti and life mean
dishonouri know well that you will rise to it and fall shoulder
to shoulder will pass as hero should on to the land of shadeson
to that valhalla of which no true heart should fear to set foot upon
the threshold
ernest sat down amid ring cheer nor did these nobl word come
as thei did straight from the loyal heart of an english gentleman
fail of their effect on the contrari when a fortnight later
alston hors form that fatal ring on isandhlwana bloodi field
thei flash through the brain of more than on despair man so
that he set hi teeth and di the harder for them
bravo my young vike said mr alston to ernest while the roof
wa still echo to the cheer evok by hi speech the old
berserk spirit is crop up eh he knew that ernest mother
famili like so mani of the old eastern counti stock were of danish
extract
it wa a great night for ernest
two dai later alston hors sixtyfour strong march out of
pretoria with a militari band plai befor ala thei never march

gentlemen who had accompani them halt and have given them
three cheer turn and left them ernest too turn and gaze at
the pretti town with it white hous and rosehedg red with bloom
nestl on the plain beneath and wonder if he would ever see it

the troop wa then order to march at eas in halfsect and
ernest rode up to the side of alston on hi other side wa the boi
roger now about fourteen year of ag who act as alston
aidedecamp and wa in high spirit at the prospect of the come
campaign present alston sent hi son back to the other end of the
line on some errand

thei choos to make a night attack how thei ar to be kept out i
should like to know in the dark when you cant see to shoot them
unless there is some barrier these offic fresh from home dont
know what a zulu charg is that is veri clear i onli hope thei wont
have occas to find out look there and he point to a waggon
lumber along befor them on the top of which among a lot of other
miscellan articl lai a bundl of cricket bat and wicket
thei think that thei ar go on a picnic what is the us too i
should like to know of send four feebl column sprawl over

on arriv in the camp mr alston learn on report himself to
the offic command that two strong parti of mount men under
the command of major dartnel were out on a reconnaiss toward the

in forc the order he receiv were to rest hi hors as he might
be requir to join the mount forc with major dartnel on the
morrow
that night as alston and ernest stood togeth at the door of their
tent smoke a pipe befor turn in thei had some convers it
wa a beauti night and the star shone brightli ernest look at
them and thought on how mani of man war those star had look
stargaz ask mr alston
i wa contempl our futur home said ernest laugh
ah you believ that do you think you ar immort and that sort
of thing
ye i believ that we shall live mani live and that some of them
will be there and he point to the star dont you
i dont know i think it rather presumptu why should you propos
that for you is reserv a bright destini among the star more than
for these and he put out hi hand and clasp sever of a swarm of
flyingant which were pass at the time just think how small must
be the differ between these ant and us in the ey of a power who
can produc both these have their home their govern their
coloni their drone and worker thei enslav and annex lai up
rich and to bring the argument to an appropri conclus make
peac and war what then is the differ we ar bigger walk on two
leg have a larger capac for suffer and we believ a soul
is it so great that we should suppos that for us is reserv a
heaven or all the gloriou world which peopl spacefor these
annihil perhap we ar at the top of the tree of develop
and for them mai be the futur for us the annihil who know
there fly awai and make the most of the present for noth els is
certain
you overlook religion entir
religion which religion there ar so mani our christian god
buddha moham brahma all number their countless million of
worshipp each promis a differ thing each command the
equal intens belief of hi worshipp for with them all blind
faith is a condit preced and each appear to satisfi their
spiritu aspir can all of these be true religion each hold
the other fals and outsid the pale each tri to convert the other
and fail there ar mani lesser on of which the same thing mai be
said
but the same spirit underli them all
perhap there is much that is nobl in all religion but there is
also much that is terribl to the actual horror and wear
anxieti of physic exist religion bid us add on the vaguer
horror of a spiritu exist which ar to be absolut endless
the averag christian would be uncomfort if you depriv him of
hi hell and hi person devil for myself i declin to believ in
such thing if there is a hell it is thi world thi world is a
place of expiat for the sin of the world and the onli real devil
is the devil of man evil passion
it is possibl to be religi and be a good man without believ in
hell said ernest
ye i think so otherwis my chanc is a poor on besid i do not
deni the almighti power i onli deni the cruelti that is attribut to
him it mai be that from the accumul mass of the wrong and
bloodsh and agoni of thi hard world that power is build up some
high purpos out of the bodi of million of live creatur natur
work out her purpos and made the rock but the process must have
been unpleas to the live creatur by whose humbl mean the
great strata were rear up thei live to die in billion that ten
of thousand of year afterward there might be a rock it mai be so
with us our tear and blood and agoni mai produc some solid end that
now we cannot guess their volum which cannot be wast for noth
is wast mai be build up on of the rock of god faroff
purpos but that we shall be tortur here for a time in order that
we mai be indefinit tortur there and he point to the star
that i will never believ look at the mist rise from that hollow
so doe the reek of the world miseri rise as an offer to the
world god the mist will ceas to rise and fall again in rain and
bring a bless but the incens of human suffer rise night and
dai for so long as the earth shall endur nor doe it fall again in
dew of merci and yet christian who declar that god is love
declar too that for the vast major of their fellowcreatur
thi process is to continu from millennium to millennium
it depend on our life thei sai
look here ernest a man can do no more than he can when i got to
the ag of discret which i put at eightandtwentyy have

three resolut alwai to try and do my duti never to turn my back
on a poor man or a friend in troubl and if possibl not to make

more or less either in the spirit or the letter but in the main i
have stuck to them and i can put my hand upon my heart tonight and
sai i have done my best and so i go my path turn neither to

fear noth for i know he ha wreak hi worst upon me and can
onli at the utmost bring me etern sleep and hope noth becaus
my experi here ha not been such as to justifi the hope of ani

station on the hill to the north of the camp and after a stubborn
resist annihil it it wa follow by the nokenk
imbonambi and nkobamakosi regiment who execut a flank
movement and threaten the front of the camp for a while the undi
corp which form the chest of the armi held it ground then it
march off to the right and direct it cours to the north of
isandhlwana mountain with the object of turn the posit
meanwhil the remain compani of the 24th were advanc to
variou posit in front of the camp and engag the enemi for a
while hold them in check the two gun under major smith shell
the nokenk regiment which form the zulu left centr with great
effect the shell could be seen burst amid the dens mass of
zulu who were come on slowli and in perfect silenc make larg
gap in their rank which instantli close up over the dead
at thi point the advanc of the undi regiment to the zulu right and
the english left wa report and alston hors were order to
proce and if possibl to check it accordingli thei left and
ride behind the compani of the 24th on the hill to the north of the
camp which wa now hotli engag with the umcitu and durnford
basuto who fight splendidli were slowli be push back made
for the north side of isandhlwana as soon as thei got on to the high
ground thei caught sight of the undi who someth over three
thousand strong were run swiftli in a format of compani
about half a mile to the northward
by heaven thei mean to turn the mountain and seiz the
waggonroad said mr alston gallop
the troop dash down the slope toward a pass in a stoni ridg which
would command the path of the undi as thei did so break through
and kill two or three of a thin line of zulu that form the
extrem point of on of the horn or nipper by mean of which the
enemi intend to enclos the camp and crush it
after thi alston hors saw noth more of the gener fight but
it mai be as well to briefli relat what happen the zulu of the
variou regiment push slowli on toward the camp notwithstand
their heavi loss their object wa to give time to the horn or
nipper to close round it meanwhil those in command realis too
late the extrem serious of the posit and began to concentr
the variou compani too late the enemi saw that the nipper had
close he knew too that the undi could not be far off the
waggonroad the onli wai of retreat and so abandon hi silenc
and hi slow advanc he rais the zulu warshout and charg it
from a distanc of from six to eight hundr yard
up to thi time the english loss had been small for the shoot of
the zulu wa vile the enemi on the contrari had especi dure
the last halfhour befor thei charg lost heavili but now the
tabl were turn first the natal conting see that thei were
surround bolt and laid open the right and rear flank of the
troop in pour the zulu so that most of the soldier had not even
time to fix bayonet in anoth minut our men were be assegai
right and left and the retreat on the camp had becom a fear rout
but even then there wa nowher to run to the undi corp which
afterward pass on and attack the post at rork drift alreadi
held the waggonroad and the onli practic wai of retreat wa down a
gulli to the south of the road into thi the broken fragment of the
forc plung wildli and after them and mix up with them went
their zulu foe massacr everi live thing thei came across
so the camp wa clear when a coupl of hour afterward command
lonsdal of londsdal hors wa sent back by gener chelmsford to
ascertain what the fire wa about he could see noth wrong the
tent were sand the waggon were there there were even soldier
move about it did not occur to him that it wa the soldier coat
which were move on the back of kafir and that the soldier
themselv would never move again so he rode quickli up to the
headquart tent out of which to hi surpris there suddenli
stalk a huge nake zulu smear all over with blood and wave in
hi hand a bloodi assegai
have seen enough he then rode back again to tell the gener that
hi camp wa taken
to god good provid and cetywayo clemenc rather than to our
own wisdom do we ow it that all the outli homestead in natal
were not laid in ash and men women and children put to the
assegai
chapter xx
the end of alston hors
alston hors soon reach the ridg past which the undi were
commenc to run at a distanc of about three hundr and fifti
yard and the order wa given to dismount and line it thi thei did
on man in everi four keep a few pace back to hold the hors of
hi section then thei open fire and next second came back the
sound of the thud of the bullet on the shield and bodi of the
zulu warrior
ernest seat up high on hi great black hors the devil for the
offic did not dismount could see how terribl wa the effect of
that rake fire deliv as it wa not by raw english boi who
scarc knew on end of a rifl from the other but by men all of
whom could shoot and mani of whom were crack shot all along the
line of the undi compani men threw up their arm and drop dead
or stagger out of the rank wound but the main bodi never paus
by and by thei would come back and move the wound or kill them if
thei were not like to recov
soon as the rang got longer the fire began to be less deadli and
ernest could see that fewer men were drop
ernest said alston gallop up to him i am go to charg
them look thei will soon cross the donga and reach the slope of
the mountain and we shant be abl to follow them on the broken
ground
isnt it rather riski ask ernest somewhat dismai at the idea
of launch their littl clump of mount men at the move mass
befor them
riski ye of cours it is but my order were to delai the enemi as
much as possibl and the hors ar fresh but my ladand he bent
toward him and spoke lowit doesnt much matter whether we ar
kill charg or run awai i am sure that the camp must be
taken there is no hope goodby ernest if i fall fight the corp
as long as possibl and kill as mani of those devil as you can and
if you surviv rememb to make off well to the left the regiment
will have pass by then god bless you my boi now order the bugler
to sound the ceas fire and let the men mount
ye sir
thei were the last word alston ever spoke to him and ernest often
rememb with affection admir that even at that moment he
thought more of hi friend safeti than he did of hi own as to
their tenor ernest had alreadi suspect the truth though luckili
the suspicion had not as yet impregn the corp mazooku too who
as usual wa with him mount on a basuto poni had just inform him
that in hi mazooku opinion thei were all as good as rip up
allud to the zulu habit of cut a dead enemi open and ad
a consolatori remark to the effect that man can die but onc and
good job too
but strang enough he did not feel afraid inde he never felt
quieter in hi life than he did in that hour of death a wild
expect thrill hi nerv and look out of hi ey what would
it be like he wonder in anoth minut all such thought were
gone for he wa at the head of hi troop readi for the order
alston follow by the boi roger gallop swiftli round see that
the format wa right and then gave the word to unsheath the short
sword with which he had insist upon the corp be arm
meanwhil the undi were draw on to a flat plain four hundr
yard or more broad at the foot of the mountain a veri suitabl spot
for a cavalri manoeuvr
now men of alston hors there is the enemi befor you let me see
how you can go through them charg
charg reecho ernest
charg roar sergeantmajor jone brandish hi sword
down the slope thei go slowli at first now thei ar on the plain
and the pace quicken to a handgallop
ernest feel hi great hors gather himself togeth and spring along
beneath him he hear the hum of astonish rise from the dens
black mass befor them as it halt to receiv the attack he glanc
round and see the set face and determin look upon the featur of
hi men and hi blood boil up with a wild exhilar and for a
while he tast the fierc joi of war
quicker still grow the pace now he can see the white round the dark
eyebal of the zulu
crash thei ar among them trampl them down hew them down
thrust slash stab and be stab the air is aliv
with assegai and echo with the savag zulu warcri and with the
shout of the gallant trooper fight now as trooper have not
often fought befor present as in a dream ernest see a huge zulu
seiz alston hors by the bridl jerk it on to it haunch and
rais hi assegai then the boi roger who is by hi father side
make a point with hi sword and run the zulu through he fall but
next moment the lad is attack by more is assegai and fall
fight brave then alston pull up and turn shoot with hi
revolv at the men who have kill hi son two fall anoth run
up and with a shout drive a great spear right through alston so
that it stand out a handbreadth behind hi back on to the bodi of
hi son he too fall and di next second the zulu head is cleft
in twain down to the chin that wa jeremi stroke
all thi time thei ar travel on leav a broad red line of dead
and dy in their track present it wa done thei had pass right
through the impi but out of sixtyfour men thei had lost their
captain and twenti trooper as thei emerg ernest notic that hi
sword wa drip blood and hi swordhand stain red yet he could
not at the moment rememb have kill anybodi
but alston wa dead and he wa now in command of what remain of the
corp thei were in no condit to charg again for mani hors and
some men were wound so he led them round the rear of the impi
which detach a compani of about three hundr men to deal with the
remnant of the troop went on it wai with lessen number and
fill with admir at the exhibit of a courag in no wai
inferior to their own
thi compani run swiftli took possess of the ridg down which
the troop had charg and by which alon it would be possibl for
ernest to retreat and take shelter behind stone began to pour in
an inaccur but gall fire on the littl parti of white ernest
charg up through them lose two more men and sever hors in the
process but what wa hi horror on reach the crest of the ridg
to see about a thousand zulu drawn up appar in reserv in the
neck of the pass lead to the plain beyond to escap through them
would be almost imposs for he wa crippl with wound and
dismount men and the pace of a forc is the pace of the slowest
their posit wa desper and look round at hi men he could
see that thei thought so too
hi resolut wa soon taken a few pace from where he had for a
moment halt the remaind of the corp wa a littl emin
someth like an earli british tumulu to thi he rode and
dismount turn hi hors loos order thi men to do the same
so good wa the disciplin and so great hi control over them that
there were no wild rush to escap thei obei realis their
desper case and form a ring round the rise
now men of alston hors said ernest we have done our best let
us die our hardest
the men set up a cheer and next minut the zulu creep up under
shelter of the rock which were strew around attack them with
furi
in five minut in spite of the wither fire which thei pour in
upon the surround zulu six more of the littl band were dead
four were shot two were kill in a rush made by about a dozen men
who reckless of their own life determin to break through the white
man ring thei perish in the attempt but not befor thei had
stab two of alston hors the remaind but littl more than
thirti men retir a few pace farther up the littl rise so as to
contract their circl and kept up a ceaseless fire upon the enemi the
zulu thank to the accur shoot of the white men had by thi
time lost more than fifti of their number and annoi at be put
to such loss by a foe numer so insignific thei determin to
end the matter with a rush ernest saw their leader a big almost
nake fellow with a small shield and a necklac of lion claw
walk utterli regardless of the pitiless rifl fire from group to
group and exhort them take up a rifl which had just fallen from
the hand of a dead trooperfor up to the present ernest had not
join in the firingh took a fine sight at about eighti yard at
the zulu chief broad chest and pull the shot wa a good on the
great fellow sprang into the air and drop instantli anoth
command took hi place and the final advanc began
but the zulu had to come uphil with but littl cover and score
were mown down by the scorch and continu fire from the
breechload twice when within twenti yard were thei driven
back twice did thei come on again now thei were but twelv pace or
so awai and a murder fire wa kept up upon them for a moment thei
waver then push forward up the slope
close up shout ernest and us your sword and pistol
hi voic wa heard abov the din some of the men drop the now
useless rifl and the revolv began to crack
then the zulu close in upon the doom band with a shout of bulala
umlungo kill the white man
out rang the pistolshot and fire flew from the clash of sword and
assegai and still the littl band momentarili grow fewer fought
on with labour breath never did hopeforsaken men make a more
gallant stand still thei fought and still thei fell on by on and
as thei fell were stab to death but scarc on of them wa there
whose deathwound wa in hi back
at last the remain zulu drew back thei thought that it wa done
but no three men yet stood togeth upon the veri summit of the
mound hold six foe at bai the zulu captain laugh aloud when he
saw it and gave a rapid order thereupon the remain zulu form
up and stab the wound as thei went depart swiftli over the
dead after the main bodi of the corp which had now vanish round
the mountain
thei left the six to finish the three
three hundr had come to attack alston hors not more than on
hundr depart from the attack the overpow white men had
render a good account of their foe
the three left aliv on the summit of the littl hill were as fate
would have it ernest jeremi and the exsailor who had complain
of the sargust companion who it happen had just di by hi
side
their revolv were empti ernest sword had broken off short in the
bodi of a zulu jeremi still had hi sword and the sailor a club
carbin
present on of the six zulu dodg in under the carbin and ran the
sailor through glanc round ernest saw hi face turn grei the
honest fellow di as he had live swear hard
ah you black mate he sang out take that and be damn to
you the club rifl came down upon the zulu skull and crack it
to bit and both fell dead togeth
now there were five zulu left and onli ernest and jeremi to meet
them but stai suddenli from under a corps up rise anoth foe no
it is not a foe it is mazooku who ha been sham dead but
suddenli and most opportun show himself to be veri much aliv
advanc from behind he stab on of the attack parti and kill
him that leav four then he engag anoth and after a long
struggl kill him too which leav three and still the two white
men stand back to back with flash ey and gasp breath and hold
their own soak with blood desper and expect death thei
were yet a gallant sight to see two of the remain zulu rush at
the giant jeremi on at ernest ernest have no effect weapon
left dodg the assegaithrust and close with hi antagonist and
thei roll over and over down the hill togeth struggl for the
assegai the zulu hold it snap in two but the blade and about eight
inch of the shaft remain with ernest he drive it through hi
enemi throat who di then he struggl up to see the close
scene of the drama but not in time to help in it mazooku ha wound
hi man badli and is follow to kill him and jeremi he ha struck
at on of the kafir with hi sword the blow is receiv on the edg
of the cowhid shield and sink halfwai through it so that the
hide hold the steel fast with a sharp twist of the shield the weapon
is jerk out of hi hand and he is left defenceless with noth to
trust to except hi nativ strength sure he is lost but nowith a
sudden rush he seiz both zulu by the throat on in each hand and
strong men as thei ar swing them wide apart then with a
tremend effort he jerk their head togeth with such aw forc
that thei fall senseless and mazooku come up and spear them
thu wa the fight end
ernest and jeremi sank upon the bloodi grass gasp for breath the
fire from the direct of the camp had now di awai and after the
tumult the shout and the shriek of the dy the silenc seem
deep
there thei lai white man and zulu side by side in the peaceabl
sunlight and in a vagu bewild wai ernest notic that the face
which a few minut befor look so grim were mostli smile now
thei had pass through the ivori gate and reach the land of
smile how still thei all were a littl blackandwhit bird such
as fli from anthil to anthil came and settl upon the forehead
of a young fellow scarc more than a boi and the onli son of hi
mother who lai quiet across two zulu the bird knew why he wa so
still ernest had like the boi and knew hi mother and began to
wonder as he lai pant on the grass what she would feel when she
heard of her son fate but just then mazooku voic broke the
silenc he had been stand stare at the bodi of on of the men he
had kill and wa now apostrophis it in zulu
ah my brother he said son of my own father with whom i us to
plai when i wa littl i alwai told you that you were a perfect fool
with an assegai but i littl thought that i should ever have such an
opportun of prove it to you well it cant be help duti is
duti and famili ti must give wai to it sleep well my brother it
wa pain to kill youveri
ernest lift himself from the ground and laugh the hyster
laugh of shatter nerv at thi nave and thoroughli zulu
moralis just then jeremi rose and came to him he wa a fear
sight to seehi hand hi face hi cloth were all red and he
wa bleed from a cut on the face and anoth on the hand
come ernest he said in a hollow voic we must clear out of
thi
i suppos so said ernest
on the plain at the foot of the hill sever of the hors were
quietli crop the grass till such time as the superior anim
man had settl hi differ among them wa ernest black
stallion the devil which had been wound though slightli on the
flank thei walk toward the hors stop on their wai to arm
themselv from the weapon which lai about as thei pass the bodi
of the man ernest had kill in hi last struggl for life he stop
and drew the broken assegai from hi throat a memento said he the
hors were caught without difficulti and the devil and the two
next best anim select then thei mount and rode toward the
top of the ridg over which ernest had seen the bodi of zulu ly in
reserv when thei were near it mazooku got down and crept to the
crest on hi stomach present to their great relief he signal
to them to advanc the zulu had move on and the vallei wa
desert so the three pass over the neck that an hour and a half
befor thei had cross with sixtyon companion who were now all
dead i think we have charm live said jeremi present all
gone except us two it cant be chanc
it is fate said ernest briefli
from the top of the neck thei got a view of the camp which now look
quiet and peac with it white tent and it union jack flutter
as usual in the breez
thei must be all dead too said ernest which wai shall we go
then it wa that mazooku knowledg of the countri prove of the
utmost servic to them he had been brought up in a kraal in the
immedi neighbourhood and knew everi inch of the land avoid the
camp altogeth he led them to the left of the battlefield and
after two hour ride over rough countri brought them to a ford of
the buffalo which he wa acquaint with some mile below where the
few survivor of the massacr struggl across the river or were
drown in attempt to do so follow thi rout thei never saw a
singl zulu for these had all depart in the other direct and
were spare the horror of the stamped and of fugit drift
at last thei gain the farther side of the river and were
compar speak safe on natal ground
thei determin after much consult to make for the littl fort
at helpmakaar and had ridden about a mile or so toward it when
suddenli the zulu quick ear caught the sound of fire distant to
their right it wa their enemi the undi corp attack rork
drift leav mazooku to hold the hors ernest and jeremi
dismount and climb a solitari koppi or hill which just there
crop out from the surfac of the plain it wa of an ironston
format and on the summit lai a huge flat slab of almost pure or
on to thi thei clamber and look along the cours of the river
but could see noth rork drift wa hidden by a rise in the
ground
all thi time a dens thundercloud had been gather in the
direct of helpmakaar and wa now as is common befor sunset in
the south african summer season travel rapidli up against the
wind set in a faint rainbow as in a frame the sun on the other
hand wa sink toward the horizon so that hi golden beam
fly across a space of blue sky imping upon the black bosom of
the cloud and were reflect thenc in sharp light and broad
shadow flung like celesti spear and shield across the plain of
zululand isandhlwana mountain wa touch by on great rai which
broke in glori upon hi savag crest and crown him that dai king
of death but the battlefield over which he tower wa drape in
gloom it wa a gloriou scene abov the wild expans of sky broken
up by flame cloud and tint with hue such as might be reflect
from the jewel wall of heaven behind the angri storm set in it
rainbowfram like eboni in a ring of gold in front the roll
plain where the tall grass wave the broad buffalo flash
through it like a silver snake the sunkiss mountain and the
shadow slope
it wa a gloriou scene natur in her most splendid mood flung all
her colour streamer loos across the earth and sky and wave them
wildli er thei vanish into night abyss life in hi most radiant
ecstasi blaze up in vari glori befor he sank like a lover to
sleep awhil in the arm of hi etern mistressdeath
ernest gaze upon it and it sank into hi heart which set to
natur tune respond ever when her hand swept the chord of earth
or heaven it lift him abov the world and thrill him with
indescrib emot hi ey wander over the infinit space
abov search for the presenc of a god then thei fell upon
isandhlwana and mark the spot just where the shadow were deepest
where hi comrad lai and gaze upon the splendid sky with ey that
could not see and at last hi spirit gave wai and weaken with
emot and long toil and abstin he burst into a paroxysm of
grief
o jeremi he sob thei ar all dead all except you and i and i
feel a coward that i should still live to weep over them when it wa
over i should have let that zulu kill me but i wa a coward and i
fought for my life had i but held my hand for a second i should have
gone with alston and the other jeremi
come come old fellow you did your best and fought the corp like
a brick no man could have done more
ye jeremi but i should have di with them it wa my duti to die
and i do not care about live and thei did i have been an
unfortun dog all my life i shot my cousin i lost eva and now i
have seen all my comrad kill and i who wa their leader alon
escap and perhap i have not done with my misfortun yet what
next i wonder what next
ernest distress wa so acut that jeremi look at him and see
that all he had gone through had been too much for him tri to
sooth him lest he should go into hyster by put hi arm round
hi waist and give him a good hug
look here old chap he said it is no us bother on head
about these thing we ar just so mani feather blown by the wind
and must float where the wind blow us sometim it is a good wind
and sometim a bad on but on the whole it is bad and we must just
make the best of it and wait till it doesnt think it worth while to
blow our particular feather about ani more and then we shall come to
the ground and not till then now we have been up here for more than
five minut and given the hors a bit of a rest we must be push
on if we want to get to helpmakaar befor dark and i onli hope we
shall get there befor the zulu that all by jove here come the
stormcom on and jeremi jump off the lump of iron or and began
to descend the koppi
ernest who had been listen with hi face in hi hand rose and
follow him in silenc as he did so a breath of icecold air from
the stormcloud which wa now right overhead fan hi hot brow
and when he had gone a few yard he turn to meet it and to cast on
more look at the scene
it wa the last earthli landscap he ever saw for at that instant
there leap from the cloud overhead a fierc stream of jag light
which struck the mass of ironor on which thei had been seat
shiver and fuse it and then ran down the side of the hill to the
plain togeth with the lightn there came an earsplit crack
of thunder
jeremi who wa now nearli at the bottom of the littl hill stagger
at the shock when he recov he look up where ernest had been
stand and could not see him he rush up the hill again call
him in accent of frantic grief there wa no answer present he
found him ly on the ground white and still

he felt about for jeremi and when he had found it grasp it
warmli
if i have troubl jeremi at least i have a bless that few can
boasta true friend if you had gone with the rest at isandhlwana
yonder i think that my heart would have broken i think we do bear
on anoth a love pass the love of women it would not be worth
much if it didnt that is on thing i wonder if absalom wa a finer
fellow than you ar jeremi from the sole of hi foot even to the
crown of hi head there wa no blemish in him your hair would not
weigh two hundr shekel after the king weight though jeremi
wore hi hair crop like a convict but i would back you to
throw absolom over your shoulder hair and all
it wa hi fashion to talk nonsens when affect by anyth and
jeremi know it said noth
just then there came a knock at the door and who should enter but
mazooku and mazooku transform hi massiv frame instead of be
cloth in the loos white garment he gener wore wa arrai in
a flannel shirt with an enorm stickup collar a suit of
pepperandsalt reachmedown sever size too small for him and a
pair of boot consider too larg for hi small and shape feet
for like those of most zulu of good blood hi hand and feet were
extrem delic made
to add to the incongru of hi appear on the top of hi hair
which wa still done in ridg zulu fashion and decor with long
bone snuffspoon wa perch an extrem small and rakishlook
billycock hat and in hi hand he carri hi favourit and most
gigant knobstick
on open the cabindoor he salut in the ordinari fashion and
come in squat down on hi haunch to await order forget
that he wa not in all the freedom of hi nativ dress the result
were most disastr with a crack and a bang the reachmedown
trouser alreadi strain to their utmost capac split right up
the back the astonish zulu flew up into the air but present
discov what had happen sat down again remark that there
wa much more room now
jeremi burst out laugh and have sketch hi retain
appear for the benefit of ernest told him what had happen
where did you get those thing from mazooku ask ernest
mazooku explain that he had bought the rigout for three pound ten
from a secondclass passeng as the weather wa grow cold
do not wear them again i will bui you cloth as soon as we get to
england if you ar cold wear your greatcoat
koo
how is the devil ernest had brought the black stallion on which
he had escap from isandhlwana home with him
mazooku repli that the hors wa well but play a man forward
had been teas him with a bit of bread he had wait till that man
pass under hi box and had seiz him in hi teeth lift him off
the ground by hi coat and shaken him sever
good give him a branmash tonight
koo
and so you find the air cold ar you not regret that you came i
warn you that you would regret
ou ka inkoo o no chief the zulu answer in hi liquid
nativ tongu when first we came upon the smoke ship and went out
on to the black water out of which the white men rise and my bowel
twist up and melt within me and i went through the agoni of a
hundr death then i regret o why i said in my heart did
not mazimba my father kill me rather than bring me on to thi great
move river sure if i live i shall grow like a white man from the
white of my heart for i am exceedingli afraid and have cast all
my insid forth all thi i said and mani more thing which i cannot
rememb but thei were dark and heavi thing but behold my father
when my bowel had ceas to melt and when new on had grown to
replac those which i had thrown forth i wa glad and did eat much
beef and then i question my heart about thi journei over the black
water and my heart answer and said mazooku son of ingoluvu of
the tribe of the maquilisini of the peopl of the amazulu you have
done well great is the chief whom you serv great is mazimba on the
huntingpath great wa he in the battl all the undi could not kill
him and hi brother the lion jeremi and hi servant the jackal
mazooku who hid in a hole and then bit those who dig o ye
mazimba is great and hi breast is full of valour you have seen him
strike the undi down and hi mind is full of the white man
knowledg and discret you have seen him form the ring that spat
out fire so fast that hi servant the horsemen were buri under the
corps of the undi so great is he that the heaven abov smell
him out as tagati as a wizard and struck him with their lightn
but could not kill him then and so now my father wander and wander
and shall wander in the dark see not the sun or the star or
the flash of spear or the light that gather in the ey of brave
men as thei close in the battl or the love which gleam in the ey
of women and how is thi shall my father want a dog to lead him in
the dark shall hi dog mazooku son of ingoluvu prove a
faithless dog and desert the hand that fed him and the man who is
braver than himself no it shall not be so my chief and my father
by the head of chaka whither thou goest thither will i go also and
where thou shalt build thy kraal there shall i make my hut koo
baba
and have salut after the dignifi zulu fashion mazooku depart
to tie up hi split trouser with a bit of string there wa someth
utterli incongru between hi present appear and hi melodi
and poetic word instinct as thei were with qualiti which in some
respect make the savag zulu a gentleman and put him abov the white
christian who for the most part regard the nigger as a creatur
beneath contempt for there ar lesson to be learn even from zulu
nigger and among them we mai reckon those taught by a courag
which laugh at death an absolut fidel to those who have a right
to command it or the qualiti necessari to win it and in their raw
and unconvert state perfect honesti and truth
he is a good fellow mazooku said ernest when the zulu had gone
but i fear that on of two thing will happen to him either he will
get homesick and becom a nuisanc or he will get civilis and
becom drunken and degrad i should have done better to leav him in
natal
chapter ii
ernest evil destini
about nine oclock in the morn follow mazooku orat a young
ladi came run up the stair of the princip plymouth hotel and
burst into a privat sittingroom like a human bombshel of
attract appear somewhat to the astonish of a bald old
gentleman who wa sit at breakfast
good graciou dorothi have you gone suddenli mad
o reginald the conwai castl is nearli in and i have been to the
offic and got leav for us to go off in the launch so come along
quick
what time doe the launch leav
a quarter to ten exactli
then we have threequart of an hour
o pleas reginald be quick it might go befor you know
mr cardu smile and rise put on hi hat and coat to oblig
dorothi he said but as a matter of fact he wa as excit as she
wa there wa a patch of red on each of hi pale cheek and hi hand
shook
in a quarter of an hour thei were walk up and down the quai by the
custom hous wait for the launch to start
after all these year said mr cardu and blind
do you think that he will be much disfigur reginald
i dont know dear your brother said noth about it
i can hardli believ it it seem so strang to think that he and
jeremi should have been spare out of all those peopl how good god
is
a cynic repli mr cardu with a smile or the relat of the
sixti other peopl who di might draw a differ conclus
but dorothi wa think how good god wa to her she wa dress in
pink that morn and
oh she look sweet
as the littl pink flower that grow in the wheat
dorothi neither wa nor ever would be a pretti woman but she wa
essenti a charm on her kindli puzzl face and to judg
from the littl wrinkl on it she had never got to the bottom of the
question which contract her forehead as a child her steadi blue
ey her diminut round form and abov all the indescrib
light of good which shone round her like a halo all made her
charm what did it matter if the mouth wa a littl too wide or
the nose somewhat tiptilt those who can look so sweet ar abl
to dispens with such fleshli attribut as a grecian nose or
chisel lip at the least thei will have the best of it after
youth is past and let me remind you my young and love reader that
the longer and dustier portion of life road wind awai toward the
pale horizon of our path on the farther side of the grim milepost
mark 30
but what made her chiefli attract wa her piquant take manner
and the chic of her presenc she wa such a perfect ladi
all aboard if you pleas broke in the agent run in the gangwai
and thei were off toward the great grei vessel with a blue pennant at
the top
it wa a short run but it seem long to dorothi and the old
gentleman with her bigger and bigger grew the great vessel till at
last it seem to swallow up their tini steamer
eas her look out for the line there now haul awai make fast
it wa all done in an instant and next moment thei stood upon the
broad white deck amid the crowd of passeng and were look round
for ernest and jeremi
but thei were not to be seen
i hope thei ar here falter dorothi
mr cardu took hi hat off and wipe hi bald head he too hope
that thei were there
at that moment dorothi becam awar of a black man clad in a white
smock pull on over a greatcoat and carri a big spear and a
kerri in hi hand who wa push hi wai toward them next moment
he stood befor them salut vigor
koo he said thrust hi spear into the air befor mr carduss
astonish nose
inkosikaa chieftai he repeat go through the same
process befor dorothi thi wai master thi wai missi the chief
without ey send me to you thi wai the lion bring him now
thei follow him through the press toward the after part of the
ship while give up the unfamiliar languag he vocifer in zulu
it might have been sanskrit for all thei knew
make wai you low peopl make wai for the old man with the shine
head on whose brow sit wisdom and the fair young maiden the sweet
rosebud who come c
at that moment dorothi quick ey saw a great man issu from a
cabin lead anoth man by the hand and then she forgot
everyth and ran forward
o ernest ernest she cri
the blind man cheek flush at the music of her voic he drew hi
hand from jeremi and stretch out hi arm toward the voic it
would have been easi to avoid themon never need be kiss by a
blind manbut she did not avoid them on the contrari she place
herself so that the grope arm close round her while a voic said
dorothi where ar you
here ernest here and in anoth moment he had drawn her to him
and kiss her on the face and she had return the kiss
next she kiss jeremi too or rather jeremi lift her up two or
three feet and kiss herit came to the same thing then mr cardu
wrung them both by the hand wring ernest the hardest and
mazooku stood by and zulu fashion chant a littl song of hi own
improvis about how the chief came back to their kraal after a
long expedit in which thei had c and how wisdom in the shape
of a shine head and ancient on the husband without ani doubt of
mani wive and the father of at least a hundr children c and
beauti in the shape of a sweet and small on c and final thei
all went veri near to cry and danc a fling on the quarterdeck
togeth
after these thing thei all talk at onc and set about collect
their good in a muddlehead fashion when these had been put in a
pile and mazooku wa seat assegai and all upon the top of them
as a solemn warn to thiev and ill would it have gone with the
thief who dare to meddl with that pile thei start off to inspect
ernest great black hors the devil
behold dorothi stroke the devil nose and he recognis how
sweet and good she wa abandon hi usual habit and did not bite
her but onli whinni and ask for sugar then ernest go into
the box with the hors which nobodi but he and mazooku were fond of
take liberti with felt down hi flank till he came to a scar
inflict by an assegai in that mad charg through the undi and
show it to them and dorothi ey fill with tear of
thank as she thought of what that hors and it rider had gone
through and of the bleach bone of those who had gallop by their
side and she would have like to kiss ernest again onli there wa no
excus so she onli press hi hand feel that the sorrow of the
empti year which were gone wa almost aton for by thi hour of joi
then thei went ashor to the hotel and sat togeth in the pleasant
sittingroom which dorothi had chosen and made sweet with great
bunch of violet for she rememb that ernest love violet and
talk at length mr cardu and jeremi went off to see about get
the thing through the custom hous where thei arriv to find
mazooku keep half a dozen gorgeou offici who want to open a
box at bai with hi knobstick and plaster them with offens
epithet which fortun thei did not understand
doll said ernest present it is a beauti dai is it not
will you take me for a walk dear i should like to go for a walk
ye ernest of cours i will
you ar sure you do not mind be seen with a blind man you must
give me your hand to hold you know
ernest how can you
mind give him her hand to hold inde thought dorothi to herself
as she ran to put her bonnet on o that she could give it to him for
alwai and in her heart she bless the accid of hi blind
becaus it brought him so much nearer to her he would be helpless
without her thi tall strong man and she would be ever at hi side
to help him he would not be abl to read a book or write a letter
or to move from room to room without her sure she would soon be
abl so to weav herself into hi life that she would becom
indispens to it
and then perhapsperhapsand her heart puls with a joi so intens
at the mere thought of what might follow that it becam a pain and
she caught her breath and lean against a wall for everi fibr of
her frame wa thrill with a passion love for thi blind man whom
she had lost for so mani year and now had found again and in her
breast she vow that if she could help it she would lose him no more
why should she when he had been engag to eva she had done her best
for him and her and bitterli had she felt the wai in which he had
been treat but eva had taken her own cours and wa now no longer
in the outward and visibl run whatev place she might still
hold in the inward and spiritu side of ernest natur dorothi did
not underr that place she knew well that the imag of her rival
had sunk too deep into hi heart to be altogeth dislodg by her
but she wa prepar to put up with that
on cant have everyth you know she said shake her wise
littl head at her own reflect in the glass as she ti her
bonnetstr
dorothi wa an emin practic littl person and have
recognis the etern veriti of the sai that half a loaf is
better than no bread especi if on happen to be dy of hunger
she made up her mind to make the best of the posit sinc she could
not help it eva would be welcom to the inward and spiritu side of
ernest and onli she could secur the outward and visibl side for
after all that is real and tangibl and there isnt much human
comfort in spiritu affect you know she said with anoth
shake of the head
in short the argument which prove so convinc to her were not
unlik those that carri convict home to the gentl breast of mr
plowden when he made up hi mind to marri eva in the teeth of her
engag to and love for ernest but put asid the divers
of the circumst there wa thi differ between them mr
plowden recognis no higher spiritu part at all he did not believ
in that sort of thing he contract for eva as he would have
contract to bui a love anim and when he had got the given
quantiti of flesh and blood he wa satisfi of the soulth inner
selfwhich the human casket held and which loath and hate him he
took no account he had got the woman what did he care about the
woman soul soul and spiritu part and affin with what is
good and high and the divin of love c c were capit thing
to preach about but thei did not appli to the affair of everydai
life besid if he had been ask he would have given it as hi
candid opinion that women did not possess ani of these thing
there ar hundr of educ men who think like mr plowden and
there ar thousand of educ ladi who give colour to such
opinion by their idl aimless cours of life their utter
inappreci of anyth beyond their own littl daili round and
the gossip of the dozen or so of famili who for them make up what
thei call societi and the interest of exist and by their conduct
in the matter of marriag truli the great factor in the lower of
women is woman herself but what doe it matter in due cours thei
have their famili and the world goe on
now dorothi did believ in all these thing and she knew what an
import part thei plai in human affair and how thei domin over
and direct finer mind so did she believ in the exist of the
planet and in the bloom of rose in wall garden but as she
could not get near to know the beauti of the star or to see the
open rosebud she had to satisfi herself with the light that
pour from the on and the scent that came from the other when on
is starstricken or mad in the matter of rose that is better than
noth
so take ernest by the hand she led him through the crowd street
with tender care and on to the quiet hoe and as thei pass the
peopl turn to look at the handsom young fellow who wa blind and
some thought that thei would not mind a littl blind if it led to
be person conduct by so sweet a maid
soon thei reach the garden
now tell me about yourself ernest what have you been do all
these long year besid grow bigger and handsom and get
that hard look about the mouth
a great mani thing doll shoot fight plai the fool
pshaw i know all that or at least i can guess it what have you
been do in your mind you know
why think of you of cours doll
ernest if you talk to me like that i will go awai and leav you to
find your own wai home i know well of whom you have been think
everi dai and everi night it wa not of me now confess it
dont let talk of her doll if you talk of the devil you know
you sometim rais him not that he requir much rais in thi
instanc he laugh bitterli
i wa so sorri for you ernest dear and i did my best inde i did
but i could do noth with her she must have been off her head or
that man dorothi alwai spoke of plowden as that man and
florenc had some power over her or perhap she never realli care
for you there ar some women you know who seem veri sweet but
cannot truli care for anybodi except themselv at ani rate she
marri and ha a famili of children for i have seen their birth in
the paper oh ernest when i think of all you must have suffer out
there about that woman i ceas to be sorri for her and begin to hate
her i am afraid you have been veri unhappi ernest all these year
ah ye i have been unhappi sometimessometim i have consol
myself there what is the us of tell liesi have alwai been
unhappi and never more so than when i have been in process of
consol but you should not hate her poor girl perhap she ha
her bad time too onli unfortun you women cannot feel at
least not muchnot like us i mean
i dont know about that put in dorothi
well i will qualifi my remarkmost women and besid it is not
quit her fault peopl cannot help themselv much in thi world she
wa appoint to be my evil destini that is all and she must fulfil
her mission all my life she will probabl bring me troubl till at
last the fate work itself out but dolli my dear there must be an
end to these thing and natur alwai fertil in analog teach
us that the end of sorrow will be happi it is from the dark
of night that dai is born and ic and snow ar follow by the
flower noth is lost in the world as old alston us to sai and
it is imposs to suppos that all the grief and suffer ar alon
wast that thei ar the onli dull seed which will not when their
dai come bloom into a beauti life thei mai seem to be intang
thing now but after all the differ between tangibl and
intang is onli a differ of matter we know that intang
thing ar real enough and perhap in a futur state we shall find
that thei ar the true immort part i think so myself
i think so too
well then doll you see if onc on get the masteri of that idea
it make the navig easier onc admit that everyth work to an
end and that end a good and endur on and you will ceas to call
out under your present sorrow but it is hard for the littl boi to
learn to like be whip and we ar all children doll to the end
of our dai
ye
and you see doll for some reason i have been pick out for the
rod it doe seem rather hard that a woman like that should be
allow to turn all the wine of a man life into vinegar but so it
often is now if she had di that would have been bad enough but i
could have born it and bide my time in the hope of join her or
if she had ceas to love me and learn to love the other man i
think i could have born that becaus my pride would have come to my
rescu and becaus i know that the law of her affect is the onli
law which the heart of woman readili acknowledg to howev mani
other she mai be forc to conform and that a woman of refin
natur who ha ceas to love you and is yet forc to live with you
is in consequ a thing worthless to you and dishonour in her own
ey besid i ask no favour in such matter i have no sympathi
as a gener rule with peopl who rais a din becaus thei have lost
the affect of their wive or sweetheart for thei should have been
abl to keep them if ani man could have cut me out he wa welcom to
do so for he would have prove himself the better man and as for the
ladi i would not have her without her heart but i gather that wa
not quit the case with eva
o no inde at least she said that she wa wretch
exactli as i thought well now you will understand that it is
rather hard you see i did love her dearli and it is pain to think
of thi woman whose love i won and who by that divin right and by
the law of natur should have been my wife as forc into be the
wife of anoth man howev charm he mai be and i hope for her
sake that he is charm in fact it fill me with a sensat i
cannot describ
poor ernest
oh no dont piti me everybodi ha hi troublesthi is mine
oh ernest but you have been unfortun and now your sight ha
gone but perhap critchett or couper would be abl to do someth
with that
all the critchett and couper in the world will never do anyth
for it my dear but you must rememb that where i onli lost my
sight mani other lost their live and it is suppos to better to
lose your sight than your life besid blind ha it advantag
it give you more time to think and it humbl you so much you can
have no idea what it is like doll intens everlast black
hedg you in like a wall on long long night even when the
sunlight is beat on your face and out of the night voic and the
touch of hand like the voic and the touch of depart
spirit your physic bodi is as helpless and as much at the merci of
the world as your spiritu bodi is in the hand of the almighti
thing grow dim to you too you begin to wonder what familiar face
and sight ar like as you wonder about the exact appear of those
who di mani year ago or of place you have not seen for year all
of which my dear doll is veri favour to thought when next you
lie awak for five or six hour in the night try to reckon all the
thing which occupi your brain then imagin such wake and it
accompani thought extend over the period of your natur life
and you will get some idea of the depth and breadth and height of
total blind
hi word struck her and she did not know what to answer so she onli
press hi hand in token of her mute sympathi
he understood her mean the faculti of the blind ar veri quick
do you know doll he said come back to you and your gentl

which had obscur the sun pass awai and it full light struck up

rain and mist you bring peac with you my dear i have not felt such
peac for year as i feel hold your hand todai

silenc at that moment a littl girl who wa trundl a hoop down
the gravelpath stop her hoop to look at the pair she wa veri
pretti with larg dark ey but dorothi notic that she had a
curiou mark upon her forehead present dorothi saw her run back
toward an extrem tall and grace woman who wa saunter
along follow at some distanc by a nurs with a babi in her arm
and turn occasion to look at the bed of spring flower
hyacinth and tulip which border the path
o mother she heard the littl girl call out in the clear voic of
childhood there is such a nice blind man he isnt old and ugli and
he hasnt a dog and he doesnt ask for penni why is he blind if he
hasnt a dog and doesnt ask for penni
blind accord to thi littl ladi idea evid sprang
from the presenc of a cur and an unsatisfi hunger for copper coin
sometim it doe

chapter iii
introspect
eva plowden could scarc be said to be a happi woman a refin
person who ha deliber marri on man when she love anoth is
not as a rule happi afterward unless inde she is bless or
curs with a singularli callou natur but there ar degre and
degre of unhappi such a fate as eva would have kill
dorothi and would have driven florenc bad as she might otherwis
be to suicid or mad but with eva herself it wa not so she wa
not suffici fine strung to suffer thu her wa not a veri
happi life but that wa all she had been most miser but when
the first burst of her miseri had pass like the rave storm that
sometim usher in a wet decemb dai like a sensibl woman she had
more or less reconcil herself to her posit the dai wa alwai
rather wet it is true but still the sun peep out now and again
and if life wa not exactli a joyou thing it wa at least endur
yet with it all she love ernest in her heart as much as ever hi
memori wa inexpress dear to her and her regret were sometim
veri bitter on the whole howev she had got over it
wonderfullybett than anybodi would have thought possibl who could
have wit her agoni some year befor when florenc told her the
whole truth immedi after the wed the sabin women we ar
told offer a veri reason resist to their rape by the
roman but befor long thei gave the strongest proof of
reconcili to their lot there wa someth of the sabin woman
about eva inde the contrast between her state of mind as regard
ernest and ernest state of mind as regard her would make a
curiou studi thei each love the other and yet how differ had
the result of that love been on the two natur to eva it had been
and wa a shame sorrow sometim veri real to ernest the
destruct of all that made life worth live the contrast inde
wa so strike as to be almost pitiabl so wide a gulf wa fix
between the two the passion of the on wa a wretch thing compar
to the other but both were real it remain mere a differ of
degre if eva affect wa weak when measur by ernest thi
wa becaus the soil in which it grew wa poorer she gave all she had
to give
as for mr plowden he could not but feel that on the whole hi
matrimoni specul had answer veri well he wa honestli fond
of hi wife and as he had a right to be veri proud of her at time
she wa cold and caprici and at time she wa sarcast but take
it altogeth she made him a good and servic wife and lift
him up mani peg in the social scale peopl saw that though plowden
wa not a gentleman he had manag to marri a ladi and a veri love
ladi too and he wa toler inde to a certain extent court
for the sake of hi wife it wa princip to attain thi end that
he had marri her so he had everi reason to be satisfi with hi
bargain and he wa besid proud to be the legal owner of so
handsom a creatur
eva often thought of her old lover though except in the vaguest wai
she had heard noth of him for year inde she wa as it
happen think of him tenderli enough that veri morn when her
littl girl had call her attent to the nice blind man and when
at last in a wai which seem to her littl short of miracul she
set ey again upon hi face her smother smoulder passion broke
into flame and she felt that she still love him with all her
strength such as it wa at that moment inde she realis how
great how bitter how complet wa the mistak she had made and what
a beauti thing life might have been for her if thing had gone
differ but rememb how thing were she bow her head
and pass on for the time complet crush
present howev two point becam clear in the confus of her
mind take shape and form as distinct and indisput mental fact
and these werefirst that she wa wildli jealou of dorothi second
that it wa her fix determin to see ernest she regret now
that she had been too overcom to go up and speak to him for see him
she must and would inde her sick long to look upon hi face and
hear hi voic fill her with alarm
eva reach her home after the meet on the hoe just befor
luncheontim her husband wa now act as locum tenen for the
rector of on of the plymouth parish thei had move thu from place
to place for year wait for the kesterwick live to fall vacant
and eva like the rove life well enoughit divert her thought

chapter v
home again
it wa veri peac that life at kesterwick after all the fierc
racket and excit of the past year inde as dai succeed dai
and brought noth to disturb hi dark but the sound of dorothi
gentl voic and the scent of flower on the marsh when the wind
blew toward the ocean and the sharp strong odour of the sea when it
set upon the land ernest could almost fanci that the past wa noth
but a dream more or less ugli and that thi wa a dream more or less
pleasant from which he should present awak and find himself a boi
again
english villag chang but littl now and again a person di and
pretti frequent some on is born but on the whole the tide of
time creep on veri impercept and though in the cours of natur
the entir popul is chang everi sixti year or so nobodi seem
to realis that it is chang there is so littl in such place by
which to mark the chang the same churchtow make a landmark to
the ey as it did centuri ago in the ey of our ancestor and the
same cloud sweep across the same blue space abov it there ar the
same old hous the same stream and abov all the same road and
lane if you could put on of our saxon forefath down in the
neighbourhood of most of our countri town he would have littl
difficulti in find hi wai about it is the men who chang not the
place
still there were some few chang at kesterwick here and there the
sea had taken anoth bite of the cliff notabl on the north side of
dum ness out of which a larg slice had gone thu bring the
water consider nearer to the hous here and there a tree too
had been cut down or a cottag built or a famili chang it
resid for instanc miss florenc ceswick had suddenli shut up
the cottag where she had remain ever sinc eva marriag see
noth of her sister or her sister husband and had gone
abroadpeopl said to rome to studi art for florenc had suddenli
electrifi the kesterwick neighbourhood by appear as an artist of
tragic forc and gruesom imagin a larg pictur by her hand had
been exhibit in the royal academi of the previou year and though
the colour wa somewhat crude and the draw not faultless it
made a deserv sensat and final sold for a consider sum
thi pictur repres a promontori of land run out far into a
stormi ocean the sky abov the sea wa of an inki black except
where a fierc rai of light from the set sun pierc it and
imping upon the boil water which surg round the low cliff of
the promontori on the extrem edg of the cliff stood a tall and
love woman the wind caught the white robe she wore and press it
against her reveal the extraordinari beauti of her form and
lift her long fair lock toss them in wild confus she wa
bend forward point with her right hand at the water with such
a look of ghastli agoni upon her beauti face and in the great grei
ey that peopl of impression tempera were wont to declar
it haunt their sleep for week down below her just where the
fierc rai lit up the heav water gleam a nake corps it wa
that of a young man and wa slowli sink into the unfathom
dark of the depth turn round and round as it sank the ey
and mouth were wide open and the stare of the former appear to be
fix upon those of the woman on the cliff lastli over the corps
in the stormwreath abov there hover on steadi wing a dim femal
figur with it arm thrown across the face as though to hide it in
the catalogu thi pictur wa call the lost lover but
specul wa rife as to what it meant
dorothi heard of it and went to london to see it the first thing
that struck her about the work wa the extraordinari contrast it
present to the commonplac canvas by which it wa surround of
reaper of littl girl frisk with baalamb and nude young women
muse profoundli on the edg of pool as though thei were try to
solv the great questionto wash or not to wash but soon the horror
of the pictur laid hold upon her and seem to fascin her as it
had so mani other then she becam awar that the face were familiar
to her and suddenli it broke upon her mind that the sink corps
wa ernest and the agonis woman eva she examin the face more
attent there wa no doubt about it florenc with consumm
art had chang the colour of the hair and featur and even to a
great extent alter the featur themselv but she had preserv
the like perfectli both upon the dead face of the murder man
and in the horrorinspir ey of hi lover the pictur made her
sick with fearsh could not tell whyand she hurri from
burlington hous full of dread of the terribl mind that had conceiv
it
there had been no intercours between the two women sinc eva
marriag florenc live quit alon at the cottag and never went
out anywher and if thei met by ani chanc thei pass with a bow
but for all that it wa a relief to dorothi to hear that she wa not
for some long time to see that stern face with it pierc brown
ey
in dum ness itself there appear to be no chang at all except
that mr cardu had built a new orchidhous at the backfor as he
grew older hi mania for these flower increas rather than
diminishedth place wa exactli the same even the arrang of
the sittingroom wa unchang and on it familiar bracket rest the
case which jeremi had made to contain the witch head
the peopl in the hous to all appear had chang as littl as the
hous itself jeremi confid to ernest that doll had grown rather
tubbi which wa hi eleg wai of indic that she had
develop a veri pretti figur and that grice the old housekeep
wa as skinni as a flai weasel and had ey like the point of a
knife ernest malici repeat these sai to the two ladi
concern with the result that thei were both furiou then he
retreat and left them to settl it with jeremi
old atterleigh too wa almost exactli the same except that of late
year hi intellect seem to have brighten a littl it wa
howev difficult to make him understand that ernest wa blind
becaus the latter ey look all right he retain some
recollect of him and brought him hi notch stick to show him
that accord to hi hardrid atterleigh calcul hi
time of servic with the devil otherwis mr cardu would expir in
a few month dorothi read what the old man wrote upon hi slate and
repeat it to ernest for he be practic dumb and ernest be
blind that wa the onli wai in which thei could commun

ernest translat the first remark onlyinto the latter he did not
care to inquir for the zulu vow that he could never understand
dorothi english and mazooku accept the compromis thu for
awhil the differ wa patch up
sometim dorothi and ernest would go out ride togeth for blind
as he wa ernest could not be persuad to give up hi ride it wa
a pretti sight to see them ernest mount on hi tower black
stallion the devil which in hi hand wa as gentl as a lamb but
with everybodi els fulli justifi hi appel and dorothi on a
creamcolour cob mr cardu had given her hold in her right hand
a steel guidingrein link to the devil bit in thi wai thei
would wander all over the countrysid and sometim when a good
piec of turf present itself even ventur on a sharp canter behind
them mazooku rode as groom mount on a stout poni with hi feet
stuck zulu fashion well out at right angl to hi anim side
thei were a strang trio
so from week end to week end dorothi wa ever by ernest side
read to him write for him walk and ride with him weav
herself into the substanc of hi life
at last there came on sunni august dai when thei were sit
togeth in the shade of the chancel of titheburgh abbei it wa a
favourit spot of their for the grei old wall shelter them from
the glare of the sun and the breath of the wind it wa a spot too
rich in memori of the dead past and a pleasant place to sit
through the gape windowplac came the murmur of the ocean and the
warmth of the harvest sunshin and gaze out by the chancel doorwai
dorothi could see the long light of the afternoon danc and sparkl
on the emerald wave
she had been read to him and the book lai idl on her knee as she
gaze dreamili at those light and shadow a sweet pictur of pensiv
womanhood he too had relaps into silenc and wa evid
think deepli
present she rous herself
well ernest she said what ar you think about you ar as
dull asa the dullest thing in the world whatev that mai be what
is the dullest thing in the world
i dont know he answer awaken ye i think i do an
american novel
ye that is a good definit you ar as dull as an american
novel
it is unkind of you to sai so doll my dear i wa think of
someth doll
she made a littl face which of cours he could not see and answer
quickli
you gener ar think of someth you gener ar think
ofeva except when you ar asleep and then you ar dream of
her
ernest colour up
ye he said it is true she is often more or less in my mind it
is my misfortun doll not my fault you see i do not do thing by
halv
dorothi bit her lip
she should be vastli flatter i am sure few women can boast of
have inspir such affect in a man i suppos it is becaus she
treat you so badli dog love the hand that whip them you ar a
curiou charact ernest not mani men would give so much to on who
ha return so littl
so much the better for them if i had a son i think that i should
teach him to make love to all women and to us their affect as a
mean of amus and selfadvanc but to fall in love with
none
that is on of your bitter remark for which i suppos we must thank
eva you ar alwai make them now let me tell you that there ar
good women in the world ye and honest faith women who when
thei have given their heart ar true to their choic and would not
do it violenc to be made queen of england but you men do not go the
right wai to find them you think of noth but beauti and never
take the troubl to learn the heart of the sweet girl who grow like
daisi in the grass all round you but who do not happen to have
great melt ey or a splendid figur you tread them underfoot and
if thei were not so humbl thei would be crush as you rush off and
try to pick the rose and then you prick your finger and cry out and
tell all the daisi how shamefulli the rose ha treat you
ernest laugh and dorothi went on
ye it is an unjust world let a woman but be beauti and
everyth is at her feet for you men ar despic creatur and
care for littl except what is pleasant to the sens on the other
hand let her be plain or onli ordinarylookingfor the fate of most
of us is just to escap be uglyand you pai as much regard to her
as you do to the chair you sit on and yet strang as it mai seem to
you probabl she ha her feel and her capac for high
affect and her imagin power all work vigor behind
her plain littl face probabl too she is better than your beauti
natur doe not give everyth when she endow a woman with perfect
loveli she robe her either of her heart or her brain or
perhap of both but you men dont see that becaus you wont look
so in cours of time all the fine possibl in miss plainfac
wither up and she becom a disappoint old maid while my ladi
beauti pursu her career of selfish and mischiefmak till at
last she wither up too that on comfort we all end in bone you
know and there isnt much differ between us then
ernest had been listen with great amus to dorothi view he
had no idea that she took such matter into her shrewd consider
i heard a girl sai the other dai that on the whole most women
prefer to becom old maid he said
then she told fib thei dont it isnt natur that thei
shouldthat is if thei care for anybodi just think there ar more
than ten hundr thousand of our charm sisterhood in these island
and more women be born everi dai ten hundr thousand restless
unoccupi disgust loveless women it is simpli aw to think of
i wonder thei dont breed a revolut if thei were all beauti
thei would
he laugh again
do you know what remedi mazooku would appli to thi state of
affair
no
the instant adopt of polygami there ar no unmarri women among
the natal zulu and as a class thei ar extrem happi
dorothi shook her head
it wouldnt do here it would be too expens
i sai doll you spoke just now of our charm sisterhood you ar
rather young to consid yourself an old maid do you want to becom
on
ye she said sharpli
then you dont care for anybodi eh
she blush up furious
what busi is it of your i should like to know she answer
well doll not much but will you be angri with me if i sai
someth
i suppos you can sai what you like
ye but will you listen
if you speak i cannot help hear
well then dollnow dont be angri dear
o ernest how you aggrav me cant you get it out and have done
with it
all right doll ill steam straight ahead thi time it is thi i
have sometim late been vain enough to think that you care a
littl about me doll although i am as blind as a bat i want to ask
you if it is true you must tell me plain doll becaus i cannot see
your ey to learn the truth from them
she turn quit pale at hi word and her ey rest upon hi blind
orb with a look of unutter tender so it had come at last
why do you ask me that question ernest whether or no i care for
you i am veri sure that you do not care for me
you ar not quit right there doll but i will tell you why i ask
it it is not out of mere curios
you know all the histori of my life doll or at least most of it
you know how i love eva and gave her all that a foolish youngster
can give to a weak womangav it in such a wai that i can never have
it back again well she desert me i have lost hercertainli for
thi world and perhap for all other if there ar ani other sinc i
cannot see why peopl in a new exist should differ greatli from
what thei were in the old the leopard doe not chang it spot you
know the best happi of my life ha been wreck beyond
redempt that is a fact which must be accept as much as the fact
of my blind i am physic and moral crippl and certainli
in no fit state to ask a woman to marri me on the ground of my
person advantag but if dear doll you should as i have
sometim thought happen to care about anyth so worthless then
you see the affair assum a differ aspect
i dont quit understand you what do you mean she said in a low
voic
i mean that in that case i will ask you if you will take me for a
husband
you do not love me ernest i should weari you
he felt for her hand found it and took it in hi own she made no
resist
dear he said it is thi wai i can never give you that passion i
gave to eva becaus thank god the human heart can know it but onc
in a life but i can and will give you a husband tenderest love you
ar veri dear to me doll though it is not in the same wai that eva
is dear i have alwai love you as a sister and i think that i
should make you a good husband but befor you answer me i want you
to thoroughli understand about eva whether i marri or not i fear
that i shall never be abl to shake her out of my mind at on time i
thought that perhap if i made love to other women i might be abl to
do so on the principl that on nail drive out anoth but it wa a
failur for a month or two i got the better of my thought then thei
would get the better of me again besid to tell you the truth i am
not quit sure that i wish to do so my troubl about thi woman ha
becom a part of myself it is as i told you my evil destini and
goe where i go and now dear doll you will see why i ask you if
you realli care for me befor i ask you to marri me if you do not
care for me then it will clearli not be worth your while to marri me
for i am about as poor a catch as a man can well be if you dowel
then it is a matter for your consider
she paus awhil and answer
suppos that the posit were revers ernest at least suppos
thi suppos that you had love your eva all your life but she had
not love you except as a brother have given her heart to some
other man who wa sai marri to somebodi els or in some wai
separ from her well suppos that thi man di and that on
dai eva came to you and said ernest my dear i cannot love you as i
love him who ha gone and whom i on dai hope to rejoin in heaven
but if you wish it and it will make you the happier i will be your
true and tender wife what should you answer her ernest
answer why i suppos that i should take her at her word and be
thank ye i think that i should take her at her word
and so dear ernest do i take you at your word for as it is with
you about eva so it is with me about you as a child i love you
ever sinc i have been a woman i have love you more and more even
through all those cold year of absenc and when you came back ah
then it wa to me as it would be to you if you suddenli onc more saw
the light of dai ernest my belov you ar all my life to me and i
take you at your word my dear i will be your wife
he stretch out hi arm found her drew her to him and kiss her
on the lip
doll i dont deserv that you should love me so it make me feel
asham that i have not everyth to give you in return
ernest you will give me all you can i mean to make you grow veri
fond of me perhap too on dai you will give me everyth
he hesit a littl while befor he spoke again
doll he said you ar sure quit that you do not mind about eva
my dear ernest i accept eva as a fact and make the best of her
just as i should if i want to marri a man with a monomania that he
wa henri viii
doll you know i call her my evil destini the fact is i am afraid
of her she overpow my reason well now doll what i am drive
at is thi supposingnot that i think she willthat she were to
crop up again and take it into her head to try and make a fool of me
she might succe doll
ernest will you promis me someth on your honour
ye dear
promis me that you will hide from me noth that pass between eva
and yourself if anyth ever should pass and that in thi matter
you will alwai consid me not in the light of a wife but of a
trust friend
why do you ask me to promis that
becaus then i shall i hope be abl to keep you both out of
troubl you ar not fit to look after yourselv either of you
i promis and now doll there is on more thing notwithstand
what i said just now it is somehow fix in my mind that my fate and
that woman ar intertwin i believ perhap foolishli enough
that what we ar now pass through is but a singl phase of
interwoven exist that we have alreadi pass through possibl
mani stage and that mani higher stage and develop await us the
question is do you care to link your life with that of a man who
hold such a belief
ernest i daresai your belief is a true on at ani rate to you who
believ it for it seem probabl that as we sow so shall we reap as
we spiritu imagin so shall we spiritu inherit sinc caus
must in time produc effect these belief ar not implant in our
heart for noth and sure in the wide heaven there is room for
the realis of them all but i too have my belief and on of
them is that in god great hereaft everi love and desir soul
will be with the soul thu love and desir for him or her at ani
rate the other will be there form a part of hi or her life
though perhap it mai elsewher and with other also be pursu it
own desir and satisfi it own aspir so you see ernest
your belief will not interfer with mine nor shall i be afraid of
lose you in anoth place
and now ernest my heart love take my hand and let me lead you
home take my hand as you have taken my heart and never leav go of
it again till at last i die
so hand in hand thei went home togeth through the light and
shadow of the twilight

it will give me the greatest pleasur to explain but to do so i must
go back a littl some ten or twelv year ago you mai rememb he
began sit down with hi back to the light which struck full on
the wretch de talor face that a firm name rastrick and codlei
took out a patent for a new railwaygreas and set up an
establish in manchest not far from the famou de talor hous
which wa establish by your father
ye curs them groan de talor
mr cardu smile
by all mean curs them but what did thi enterpris firm do mr
de talor thei set to work and sold a greas superior to the articl
manufactur by your hous at about eighteen per cent cheaper but
the de talor hous had the ear of the market and the contract with
all the lead line and continent firm and for awhil it seem
as though the new hous must go to the wall and if thei had not had
consider capit at command thei must have gone to the wall
ah and where did thei get it from that the mysteri said de
talor
precis that wa the mysteri i shall clear it up a littl
present to return after awhil the buyer began to find that
rastrick and codlei greas wa a better greas and a cheaper greas
and as the contract laps the compani renew them not with the
de talor hous but with the hous of rastrick and codlei doubtless
you rememb
mr de talor groan in acquiesc and the lawyer continu in
time thi state of affair produc it natur resultsd talor
hous wa ruin and the bulk of the trade fell into the hand of the
new firm
ah i should just like to know who thei realli wereth low sneak

otherwis connect with manchest obtain the monopoli of the
greas trade which is by the wai at thi moment pai veri well i
will satisfi your curios i have alwai had a mania for take up
invent quit quietli and in the name of other sometim i
have made monei over them sometim i have lost on the whole i have
made larg but whether i have made or lost the inventor as a
rule have never known who wa back them on dai on lucki dai
thi railwai greas patent wa brought to my notic i took it up and
invest fifti thousand in it straight off the reel then i invest
anoth fifti thousand still your firm cut my throat i made an
effort and invest anoth fifti thousand had i fail i should
then have been a ruin man i had strain my credit to the utmost
but fortun favour the brave mr de talor and i succeed it wa

railwaygreas concern is worth after pai liabil some two
hundr thousand pound if you should care to go in for it messr
rastrick and codlei will i have no doubt be most happi to treat with
you it ha serv it purpos and is now in the market
de talor look at him with amaz he wa too upset to speak
so much mr de talor for my share in the greas episod the
failur of your firm or rather it stoppag from loss of trade left
you still a rich man but onli half as rich as you had been and thi
you mai rememb made you furiou you could not bear the idea of
lose monei you would rather have lost blood from your vein than
sovereign from your purs when you thought of the greas which had
melt in the fire of competit you could have wept tear of rage
in thi plight you came to me to ask advic
ye and you told me to specul

you take advantag of these fluctuat time and recoup yourself for
all you have lost the prospect of gain tempt you mr de talor
and you jump at the idea you ask me to introduc you to a
reliabl firm and i introduc you to messr campsei and ash on of
the best in the citi

well notwithstand the best effort of messr campsei and ash on
your behalf in pursuanc of written instruct as you from time to
time commun to them and to which you can no doubt refer if you
pleas thing went wrong with you mr de talor and year by year
when your balanc sheet wa sent in you found that you had lost more

you made a plung against the advic you mai rememb of messr
campsei and ash and lost it wa after that that i began to lend you
monei the first loan wa for fifti thousand then came more loss
and more loan till at length we had reach the present state of
affair
o cardu you dont mean to sell me up do you what shall i do
without monei and think of my daughter ow will thei manag without
their comfort give me time what make you so rough on me
mr cardu had been walk up and down the room rapidli at de
talor word he stop and go to a despatchbox unlock it
and drew from a bundl of document a yellow piec of stamp paper
it wa a cancel bill for ten thousand pound in the favour of jona
de talor esquir thi bill he came and held befor hi visitor
ey
that i believ is your signatur he said quietli point to the
receipt written across the bill
de talor turn almost livid with fear and hi lip and hand began
to trembl
where did you get that he ask
mr cardu regard him or rather all round him with the melancholi
black ey that never look straight at anyth and yet saw
everyth and then answer
among your friend joness paper you scoundrel he went on with a
sudden chang of manner now perhap you begin to understand why i
have hunt you down step by step why for thirti year i have wait
and watch and fail and at last succeed it is for the sake of
mari atterleigh it wa you who infuri becaus she would have
none of such a coars brute set the man jone on to her it wa you
who lent him the monei with which to bui her from old atterleigh
there li the proof befor you by the wai jone need never have

first caus of my life be laid wast and who nearli drove me to
the madhous ay who did drive mari my betroth wife into the arm
of that fellow whenc god be prais she soon pass to her rest
mr cardu paus breath quick with suppress rage and
excit the larg white eyebrow contract till thei nearli met
and abandon hi usual habit he look straight into the ey of
the abject creatur in the chair befor him
it a long while ago cardu cant you forgiv and let bygon be
bygon

whom you first dishonour and then kill i will never forgiv
where ar your companion in guilt jone is dead i ruin him
atterleigh is there i did not ruin him becaus after all he wa
the author of mari life but hi illgotten gain did him no good a
higher power than mine took vengeanc on hi crime and i save him
from the madhous and joness children thei ar here too for onc
thei lai beneath her breast but do you think that i will spare you
you coars arrog knavey who spawn the plot no not if it
were to cost me my own life would i forego on jot or tittl of my
reveng
at that moment mr cardu happen to look up and saw through the
glass part of the door of hi offic of which the curtain wa
partial drawn the wildlook head of hardrid atterleigh he
appear to be look through the door for hi ey in which there
wa a veri peculiar look were fix intent upon mr carduss face

other thing of that look in old atterleigh ey which he could
not get out of hi mind thu did he final accomplish the reveng to
which he had devot hi life
chapter ix

enough but without the smallest result the de talor had gone and
left no trace except the trace of bankruptci and kesterwick knew

but on on saturdai mr carduss busi seem to come to a sudden
stop he wrote some letter and put them in the post bag then he went
to admir hi orchid

of my nostril and i have achiev it man if he onli live long
enough and ha strength of will enough can achiev everyth except
happi but man fritter awai hi power over a varieti of object
he is led astrai in pursuit of the butterfli pleasur or the bubbl
ambit or the destroi angel woman and hi purpos fall to the
ground between a dozen stool most men too ar not capabl of a
purpos men ar weak creatur and yet what a mighti seed li hid
in everi human breast think my children what man might nai mai
becom when hi weak and folli have fallen from him when hi
rudimentari virtu have been develop and hi capac for
physic and mental beauti brought to an undream of perfect
look at the wild flower and the flower of the hothouseit is noth
compar to the possibl inher in man even as we know him it

the old man did as he wa bid somewhat sulkili dorothi thought but
when he arriv at the dinnert there wa noth notic about
hi manner
thei dine at a quarter to seven and dinner did not take them veri
long when it wa over old atterleigh drank some wine and then
accord to hi habit went and sat in the ancient inglenook which
had presum been built by the forgotten dum for hi comfort on
winter even and on winter even when there wa a jolli
woodfir burn on the hearth it wa a pleasant spot enough but to
sit there in the dark on a love summer night wa an act
wellworthi of old atterleigh
after dinner the convers turn upon that fatal dai when alston
hors wa wipe out at isandhlwana it wa a pain subject both to
ernest and jeremi but the former wa gratifi hi uncl curios
by explain to him how that last dread struggl with the six zulu
came to determin itself in their favour
and how wa it ask mr cardu that you manag to get the
better of the fellow with whom you roll down the hill
becaus the assegai broke and fortun enough the blade wa
left in my hand where is it doll for jeremi had brought it home
with him
dorothi got up and reach the broken assegai which had about eight
inch of the shaft from it place over the mantelpiec
now then jeremi if you would be so good as to sprawl upon your back
upon the floor i will just show my uncl what happen
jeremi compli not without grumbl about dirti hi dresscoat
jeremi my boi where ar you o there well excus my take the
liberti of kneel on your chest and holloa out of the assegai goe
into you if we ar go to have a perform at all it mai as well
be a realist on now uncl you see when we finish roll
which wa just as thi assegai snap in two as luck would have it i
wa uppermost and manag to get my knee on my friend left arm and
to hold hi right with my left then befor he could get loos i
drove thi bit of spear through the side of hi throat just there so
that it cut the jugular vein and he di shortli afterward and now
you know all about it
here ernest rose and laid the spear upon the tabl and jeremi
enter into the spirit of the thing began to die as artist as
a regard for hi dresscoat would allow just then dorothi look
up saw her grandfath atterleigh distort face peer round the
wall of the inglenook where he wa sit in the dark and look
at the scene of mimic slaughter with that same curiou gaze which he
had worn on sever occas late he withdrew hi head at onc
get up jeremi said hi sister sharpli and stop writh about
there like a great snake you look as though you had been murder it
is horribl
jeremi aros laugh and have obtain dorothi permiss thei
all lit their pipe and sit there in the fade light fell to
talk about that sad scene of slaughter which inde appear that
night to have a strang fascin for mr cardu he ask ernest
and jeremi about it again and againhow thi man wa kill and
thatdid thei die at onc and so on
