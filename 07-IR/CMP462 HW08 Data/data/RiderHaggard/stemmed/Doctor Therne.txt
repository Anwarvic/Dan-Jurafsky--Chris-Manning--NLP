world a year or two ago it wa famousor infamousenough but in
that time mani thing have happen there ha been a war a continent
revolut two scandal of worldwid celebr on moral and the
other financi and to come to event that interest me particularli
as a doctor an epidem of asiat plagu in itali and franc and
stranger still an outbreak of the mediaev grain sick which is
believ to have carri off 20000 peopl in russia and german poland
consequ i have no doubt upon the wet season and poor rye harvest in
those countri
these occurr and other ar more than enough to turn the public
mind from the recollect of the appal smallpox epidem that
pass over england last autumn two year of which the first furi broke
upon the citi of dunchest my nativ place that for mani year i had
the honour to repres in parliament the popul of dunchest it
is true is smaller by over five thousand soul and mani of those who
surviv ar not so goodlook as thei were but the gap is easili
fill and pockmark ar not hereditari also such a horror will
never happen again for now the law of compulsori vaccin is strong
enough onli the dead have caus of complaint those who were cut off
from the world and despatch hotfoot whither we see not myself i am
certain of noth i know too much about the brain and bodi to have
much faith in the soul and i prai to god that i mai be right ah there
it come in if a god why not the rest and who shall sai there is no
god somehow it seem to me that more than onc in my life i have seen
hi finger
yet i prai that i am right for if i am wrong what a welcom await me
yonder when grief and chloral and that slight weak of the heart
have done their work
yesfiv thousand of them or more in dunchest alon and make
everi allow i suppos that in thi on citi there were veri mani of
theseyoung peopl mostlywho ow their death to me sinc it wa
my persuas my eloqu argument work upon the mind of their
prejud and credul elder that sure if indirectli brought
their doom upon them a doctor is not infal he mai make
mistak quit so and if a mistak of hi should kill a few
thousand why that is the act of god or of fate work through hi
blind but if it doe not happen to have been a mistak if for
instanc all those dead should thei still live in ani place or shape
could sai to me jame thern you ar the murder of our bodi
sinc for your own end you taught us that which you knew not to be
the truth
how then i ask solet them sai it if thei will let all that great
cloud of wit compass me about lad and maiden children and
infant whose bone cumber the churchyard yonder in dunchest i defi
them for it is done and cannot be undon yet in their compani ar two
whose ey i dread to meet jane my daughter whose life wa sacrif
through me and ernest merchison her lover who went to seek her in the
tomb
thei would not reproach me now i know for she wa too sweet and love
me too well with all my fault and if he prove pitiless in the
first torment of hi loss merchison wa a good and honest man who
understand my remors and miseri forgav me befor he di still
i dread to meet them who if that old fabl be true and thei live read
me for what i am yet why should i fear for all thi thei knew befor
thei di and know could forgiv sure it is with anoth
vengeanc that i must reckon
well after her mother death my daughter wa the onli be whom i
ever truli love and no futur mental hell that the imagin can
invent would have power to make me suffer more becaus of her than i
have alwai suffer sinc the grave close over herth virgin martyr
sacrif on the altar of a fals prophet and a coward
i come of a famili of doctor my grandfath thoma thern whose
name still live in medicin wa a doctor in the neighbourhood of
dunchest and my father succeed to hi practic and noth els
for the old gentleman had live beyond hi mean shortli after my
father marriag he sold thi practic and remov into dunchest
where he soon acquir a consider reput as a surgeon and
prosper until not long after my birth just as a brilliant career
seem to be open itself to him death close hi book for ever in
attend a case of smallpox about four month befor i wa born he
contract the diseas but the attack wa not consid seriou and
he recov from it quickli it would seem howev that it left some
constitut weak for a year later he wa found to be suffer
from tuberculosi of the lung and wa order to a warmer climat
sell hi dunchest practic for what it would fetch to hi
assist dr bell my father came to madeirawhith i scarc know
why i have also drift now that all is over for mefor here he hope
to be abl to earn a live by doctor the english visitor thi
howev he could not do sinc the climat prove no match for hi
diseas though he linger for nearli two year dure which time he
spent all the monei that he had when he di there wa scarc enough
left to pai for hi funer in the littl churchyard yonder that i can
see from the window of thi quinta where he li exactli i do not
know as no record wa kept and the wooden cross the onli monument that
my mother could afford to set over him ha long ago rot awai
some charit english peopl help my mother to return to england
where we went to live with her mother who exist on a pension of about
120 pound a year in a fishingvillag near brighton here i grew up
get my educationa veri good on by the wayat a cheap dai school
my mother wish wa that i should becom a sailor like her own father
who had been a captain in the navi but the necessari monei wa not
forthcom to put me into the royal navi and my like for the sea wa
not strong enough to take me into the merchant servic
from the begin i wish to be a doctor like my father and
grandfath befor me for i knew that i wa clever and i knew also
that success doctor make a great deal of monei ground down as i
had been by poverti from babyhood alreadi at nineteen year of ag
i desir monei abov everyth on earth i saw then and subsequ
experi ha onli confirm my view that the world as it ha becom
under the pressur of high civilis is a world for the rich leav
materi comfort and advantag out of the question what ambit
can a man satisfi without monei take the success politician for
instanc and it will be found that almost everi on of them is rich
thi countri is too full there is scant room for the individu onli
intellectu titan can forc their head abov the crowd and as a
rule thei have not even then the monei to take them higher if i had
my life over againand it is my advic to all young men of abil and
ambitioni would leav the old countri and settl in america or in on
of the great coloni there where the condit ar more elast and
the competit is not so cruel a hardwork man of talent doe not
need to be endow with fortun to enabl him to rise to the top of the
tree
well my desir wa to be accomplish for as it chanc a younger
brother of my father who dure hi lifetim had never taken ani notic
of me di and left me 750 pound seven hundr and fifti pound to
me at that time it wa coloss wealth for it enabl us to rent
some room in london where i enter myself as a medic student at
univers colleg
there is no need for me to dwell upon my colleg career but if ani on
were to take the troubl to consult the old record he would find that
it wa suffici brilliant i work hard and i had a natur
perhap an hereditari like for the work medicin alwai fascin
me i think it the greatest of the scienc and from the begin i
wa determin that i would be among the greatest of it master
at four and twenti have finish my curriculum with high honoursi
wa gold medallist of my year in both medicin and surgeryi becam
housesurgeon to on of the london hospit after my term of offic
wa over i remain at the hospit for anoth year for i wish
to make a practic studi of my profess in all it branch befor
start a privat practic at the end of thi time my mother di
while still compar young she had never realli recov from the
loss of my father and though it wa long about it sorrow sap her
strength at last her loss wa a shock to me although in fact we had
few tast in common to divert my mind and also becaus i wa somewhat
run down and realli need a chang i ask a friend of mine who wa a
director of a great steamship line run to the west indi and mexico
to give me a trip out offer my medicin servic in return for the
passag thi he agre to do with pleasur moreov matter were so
arrang that i could stop in mexico for three month and rejoin the
vessel on her next homeward trip
after a veri pleasant voyag i reach vera cruz it is a quaint and in
some wai a pretti place with it tall coollook hous and narrow
street not unlik funchal onli more tropic whenev i think of it
howev the first memori that leap to my mind ar those of the stench
of the open drain and of the scaveng cart go their round with
the zaphilot or vultur actual sit upon them as it happen
those cart were veri necessari then for a yellow fever epidem wa
rage in the place have noth particular to do i stop there
for three week to studi it work in the hospit with the local
doctor for i felt no fear of yellow feveronli on contagi diseas
terrifi me and with that i wa soon destin to make acquaint
at length i arrang to start for the citi of mexico to which in
those dai the journei from vera cruz wa perform by dilig as the
railwai as not yet finish at that time mexico wa a wild countri
war and revolut innumer togeth with a certain natur
lean that wai had reduc a consider proport of it
inhabit to the road where thei earn a precari livingnot by
mend it but by rob and occasion cut the throat of ani
travel whom thei could catch
the track from vera cruz to mexico citi run persist uphil
inde i think the on place is 7000 feet abov the level of the other
first there is the hot zone where the women by the waysid sell you
pineappl and cocoanut then the temper zone where thei offer you
orang and banana then the cold countri in which you ar expect
to drink a filthi liquid extract from alo call pulqu that in
tast and appear resembl soapi water
it wa somewher in the temper zone that we pass a town consist
of fifteen adob or mud hous and seventeen church the excess
religi equip of thi citi is account for by an almost
inaccess mountain stronghold in the neighbourhood thi stronghold
for gener had been occupi by brigand and it wa the
timehonour custom of each chieftain of the band when he retir on
a hardearn compet to expiat ani regrett incid in hi
career by build a church in the town dedic to hi patron saint
and to the memori of those whose soul he had help to paradis thi
piou and picturesqu if somewhat mediaev custom ha now come to an
end as i understand that the mexican govern caus the stronghold
to be storm a good mani year ago and put it occup to the
number of sever hundr to the sword
we were eight in the coach which wa drawn by as mani mulesfour
merchant two priest myself and the ladi who afterward becam my
wife she wa a blueei and fairhair american from new york her
name i soon discov wa emma becker and her father who wa dead
had been a lawyer we made friend at onc and befor we had jolt
ten mile on our journei i learn her stori it seem that she wa an
orphan with a veri small fortun and onli on near rel an aunt
who had marri a mexican name gomez the owner of a fine rang or
hacienda situat on the border of the highland about eighti mile
from the citi of mexico on the death of her father be like most
american girl adventur and independ miss becker had accept
an invit from her aunt gomez and her husband to come and live with
them a while now quit alon and unescort she wa on her wai to
mexico citi where she expect to be met by some friend of her uncl
we start from vera cruz about middai and slept or rather pass the
night at a filthi inn aliv with everi sort of insect pest two hour
befor dawn we were bundl into the diligencia and slowli drag up
a mountain road so steep that notwithstand the blow and oath of
the driver the mule had to stop everi few hundr yard to rest i
rememb that at last i fell asleep my head repos on the shoulder
of a veri fat priest who snore tempestu then awok to prai then
snore again it wa the voic of miss becker who sat opposit to me
that waken me
forgiv me for disturb you dr thern she said but you realli
must look and she point through the window of the coach
follow her hand i saw a sight which no on who ha wit it can
ever forget the sun rise on the mighti peak of orizaba the star
mountain as the old aztec name it eighteen thousand feet abov our
head tower the great volcano it foot cloth with forest it cone
dust with snow the green flank of the peak and the countri beneath
them were still wrap in shadow but on it white and lofti crest
alreadi the light of dawn were burn never have i seen anyth more
beauti than thi soar mountain top flame like some giant torch
over a world of dark inde the unearthli grandeur of the sight
amaz and half paralys my mind
a lantern swung from the roof of the coach and turn my ey from
the mountain in it light i saw the face of my travel companion
andfel in love with it i had seen it befor without ani such idea
enter my mind then it had been to me onli the face of a rather
piquant and pretti girl but with thi strang and inconveni result
the sight of the dawn break upon orizaba seem to have work some
chang in me at least if onli for an instant it had pierc the
barrier that dai by dai we build within us to protect ourselv from the
attack of the impuls of natur
in that moment at ani rate there wa a look upon thi girl counten
and a light shine in her ey which overcam my caution and swept
me out of myself for i think that she too wa under the shadow of the
glori which broke upon the crest of orizaba in vain did i try to save
myself and to struggl back to commonsens sinc hitherto the prospect
of domest love had plai no part in my scheme of life it wa
useless so i gave it up and our ey met
neither of us said anyth but from that time forward we knew that we
did not wish to be part ani more
after a while to reliev a tension of mind which neither of us care to
reveal we drift into desultori and indiffer convers in the
cours of our talk emma told me that her aunt had written to her that if
she could leav the coach at orizaba she would be within fifti mile of
the hacienda of la concepcion wherea when she reach mexico citi
she would still be eighti mile from it her aunt had ad howev
that thi wa not practic at present why she did not sai and that
she must go on to mexico where some friend would take charg of her
until her uncl wa abl to fetch her
present emma seem to fall asleep at least she shut her ey but i
could not sleep and sat there listen to the snore of the fat priest
and the strang intermin oath of the driver as thei thrash the
mule opposit to me ti to the roof of the coach immedi abov
emma head wa a cheap lookingglass provid i suppos for the
conveni of passeng when make the toilett of travel in it i
could see myself reflect so have noth better to do in view of
conting which of a sudden had becom possibl i amus myself by
take count of my person appear on the whole in those dai it
wa not unsatisfactori in build i wa tall and slight with thin
nervou hand my colour and hair were dark and i had soft and
rather larg brown ey the best part of my face wa my forehead which
wa ampl and the worst my mouth which wa somewhat weak i do not
think howev that ani on would have guess by look at me as i
then appear at the ag of seven and twenti that i wa an exceedingli
hardwork man with extraordinari power of observ and a realli
retent memori
at ani rate i am sure that it wa not these qualiti which recommend
me to emma becker nor whatev we mai have felt under the influenc
of orizaba wa it ani spiritu affin doctor i fear ar not
great believ in spiritu affin thei know that such emot
can be account for in other wai probabl emma wa attract to
me becaus i wa dark and i to her becaus she wa fair orizaba and
opportun mere brought out and accentu these quit natur
prefer
by now the dai had broken and look out of the window i could see
that we were travel along the side of a mountain abov us the slope
wa gentl and cloth with subtrop tree while below it becam a
verit precipic in some place absolut sheer for the road wa
cut upon a sort of rocki ledg although ow to the vast billow of
mist that fill it noth could be seen of the gulf beneath
i wa reflect i rememb that thi would be an ill path to drive
with a drunken coachman when suddenli i saw the offfront mule stumbl
unaccount and as it fell heard a shot fire close at hand next
instant also i saw the driver and hi companion spring from the
box and with a yell of terror plung over the edg of the cliff
appar into the depth below then from the narrow compass of that
coach aros a perfect pandemonium of sound with an under cry of a
singl word brigand brigand
the merchant shout supplic their saint and swore as with
trembl hand thei tri to conceal loos valuabl in their boot
and hat on of the priest too liter howl in hi terror but the
other a man of more digniti onli bow hi head and murmur a prayer
by thi time also the mule had ti themselv into a knot and were
threaten to overturn the coach to prevent which our captor befor
meddl with us cut the anim loos with their machet or sword
and drove them over the brink of the abyss where like the driver
thei vanish then a duskyfac ruffian with a scar on hi cheek
came to the door of the dilig and bow polit beckon to us
to come out as there were at least a dozen of them and resist wa
useless even if our companion could have found the courag to fight
we obei and were place befor the brigand in a line our back
be set to the edg of the gulf i wa last but on in the line and
beyond me stood emma becker whose hand i held
then the tragedi began sever of the villain seiz the first
merchant and stop hi cri and protest with a blow in
the mouth strip him to the shirt abstract note and gold and
everyth els of valu that thei could find in variou portion of hi
attir where he had hidden them and princip i rememb from the
line of hi vest when thei had done with him thei drag him awai
and bundl him roughli into the dilig
next to thi merchant stood the two priest of the first of these
the brigand ask a question to which with some hesit
the priestthat man who had shown so much terrorrepli in the
affirm whereon hi companion look at him contemptu and
mutter a spanish phrase which mean man without shame of him also
the same question wa ask in answer to which he shook hi head
whereon he wa conduct though without violenc or be search
to the coach and shut into it with the plunder merchant then the
thiev went to work with the next victim
dr thern whisper emma becker you have a pistol do you not
i nod my head
will you lend it me you understand
ye i answer i understand but i hope that thing ar not so bad
as that
thei ar she answer with a quiver in her voic i have heard about
these mexican brigand with the except of that priest and myself
thei will put all of you into the coach and push it over the precipic
at her word my heart stood still and a palpabl mist gather befor
my ey when it clear awai my brain seem to awak to an abnorm
activ as though the knowledg that unless it wa us to good effect
now it would never be us again were spur it to action rapidli i
review the situat and consid everi possibl method of escap
at first i could think of none then suddenli i rememb that the
driver and hi companion who no doubt knew everi inch of the road had
leap from the coach appar over the edg of the precipic thi i
felt sure thei would not have done had thei been go to certain death
sinc thei would have prefer to take their chanc of merci at the
hand of the brigand moreov these gentri themselv had driven the
mule into the abyss whither those wise anim would never have gone
unless there wa some foothold for them
i look behind me but could discov noth for as is common in
mexico at the hour of dawn the gulf wa absolut fill with dens
vapour then i made up my mind that i would risk it and began to
shuffl slowli backward alreadi i wa near the edg when i rememb
emma becker and paus to reflect if i took her with me it would
consider lessen my chanc of escap and at ani rate her life wa
not threaten but i had not given her the pistol and at that moment
even in my panic there rose befor me a vision of her face as i had seen
it in the lamplight when she look up at the glori shine on the crest
of orizaba
had it not been for thi vision i think it possibl that i might have
left her i wish to gloze over noth i did not make my own natur
and in these page i describ it as it wa and is without palliat or
excus i know that thi is not the fashion in autobiographi no on
ha done it sinc the time of pepi who did not write for public
and for that veri reason my record ha it valu i am physic and
perhap moral also timidthat is although i have face it boldli
enough upon occas as the reader will learn in the cours of my
histori i fear the thought of death and especi of cruel and
violent death such as wa near to me at that moment so much did i
fear it then that the mere fact that an acquaint wa in danger and
distress would scarc have suffic to caus me to sacrific or
at least to greatli complic my own chanc of escap in order to
promot her simpli becaus that acquaint wa of the other sex but
emma had touch a new chord in my natur and i felt whether i like
it or not that whatev i could do for myself i must do for her also
so i shuffl forward again
listen i whisper i have been to look and i do not believ that
the cliff is veri steep just here will you try it with me
of cours she answer i had as soon die of a broken neck as in ani
other wai
we must watch our chanc then or thei will see us run and shoot wait
till i give you the signal
she nod her head and we wait
at length while the fourth and last merchant who stood next to me
wa be dealt with just as in our despair we were about to
throw ourselv into the gulf befor them all fortun gave us our
opportun thi unhappi man have probabl some inkl of the doom
which await him broke suddenli from the hand of hi captor and ran
at full speed down the road after him thei went pellmel everi thief
of them except on who remainedfortun for us upon it farther
sideon guard by the door of the dilig in which four peopl three
merchant and a priest were now imprison with laugh and shout thei
hunt their wretch quarri fire shot as thei ran till at length
on of them overtook the man and cut him down with hi machet
dont look but come i whisper to my companion
in anoth instant we were at the edg of the cliff and a foot or so
below us wa spread the dens impenetr blanket of mist i stop
and hesit for the next step might be my last
we cant be wors off so god help us said emma and without wait
for me to lead her she swung herself over the edg
to my intens relief i heard her alight within a few feet and follow
immedi now i wa at her side and now we were scrambl and
slip down the precipit and rocki slope as swiftli as the dens
wet fog would let us i believ that our escap wa quit unnot the
guard wa watch the murder of the merchant or if he saw us he did
not ventur to leav the carriag door and the priest who had accept
some offer which wa made to him probabl that hi life would be spare
if he consent to give absolut to the murder wa kneel on the
ground hi face hidden in hi hand
as we went the mist grew thinner and we could see that we were
travel down a steep spur of the precipic which to our left wa
quit sheer and that at the foot of it wa a wide plain thickli but not
dens cover with tree in ten minut we were at the bottom and
as we could neither see nor hear ani sign of pursuer we paus for an
instant to rest
not five yard from us the cliff wa broken awai and so straight that a
cat could not have climb it
we chose our place well i said point upward
no emma answer we did not choos it wa chosen for us
as she spoke a muffl and terrifi sound of agoni reach us from
abov and then in the layer of vapour that still stretch between
us and the sky we perceiv someth huge rush swiftli down it
appear it drew near it struck and fell to piec like a shatter
glass we ran to look and there befor us were the fragment of
the dilig and among them the mangl corps of five of our
fellowtravel
thi wa the fate that we had escap
oh for god sake come awai moan emma and sick with horror we
turn and ran or rather reel into the shelter of the tree upon the
plain
chapter ii
the hacienda
what ar those said emma present point to some anim that
were half hidden by a clump of wild banana i look and saw that
thei were two of the mule which the brigand had cut loos from the
dilig there could be no mistak about thi for the har still
hung to them
can you ride i ask
she nod her head then we set to work have caught the mule
without difficulti i took off their superflu har and put her on
the back of on of them mount the other myself there wa no time
to lose and we both of us knew it just as we were start i heard a
voic behind me call senor draw the pistol from my pocket i
swung round to find myself confront by a mexican
no shoot senor he said in broken english for thi man had serv
upon an american ship me driver antonio my mate go down there and
he point to the precipic he dead me not hurt you run from bad
men me run too for present thei come look where you go
to mexico i answer

so and he made a sweep with hi knife ad thei not want you live
tell soldier
listen said emma do you know the hacienda concepcion by the
town of san jose
ye senora know it well the hacienda of senor gomez bring you
there tomorrow
then show the wai i said and we start toward the hill
all that dai we travel over mountain as fast as the mule could
carri us antonio trot by our side at sundown have seen noth
more of the brigand who i suppos took it for grant that we were
dead or were too idl to follow us far we reach an indian hut where
we contriv to bui some wretch food consist of black frijol
bean and tortilla cake that night we slept in a kind of hovel made
of open pole with a roof of faggot through which the water drop on
us for it rain persist for sever hour to be more accur
emma slept for my nerv were too shatter by the recollect of our
adventur with the brigand to allow me to close my ey
i could not rid my mind of the vision of that coach broken like an
eggshel and of those shatter shape within it that thi veri morn
had been men full of life and plan but who tonight werewhat nor
wa it easi to forget that but for the merest chanc i might have been
on of their compani wherev it wa gather now to a man with a
constitut object to everi form of violenc and at ani rate
in those dai no desir to search out the secret of death befor hi
time the thought wa horribl
leav the shelter at dawn i found antonio and the indian who own the
hut convers togeth in the reek mist with their serap thrown
across their mouth which few mexican leav uncov until after the
sun is up inflamm of the lung is the diseas thei dread more than
ani other and the thin night air engend it
what is it antonio i ask ar the brigand after us
no senor hope brigand not come now thi senor sai much sick san
jose
i answer that i wa veri sorri to hear it but that i meant to go on
inde i think that it wa onli terror of the brigand coupl with the
promis of a consider reward which persuad him to do so though
ow to my ignor of spanish and hi veri slight knowledg of
english precis what he fear i could not discov in the end we
start and toward even antonio point out to us the hacienda of
concepcion a larg white build stand on a hill which overshadow
san jose a straggl littl place halftown halfvillag with a
popul of about 3000 inhabit
just as ride along the rough cobblepav road we reach the
entranc to the town i heard shout and turn saw two mount men
with rifl in their hand appar call to us to come back take
it for grant that these were the brigand follow us up
although as i afterward discov thei were in fact rural or
cavalrypolic despit the remonstr of antonio i urg the jade
mule forward at a gallop thereupon the rural who had pull up at
a spot mark by a white stone turn and rode awai
we were now pass down the central street of the town which i notic
seem veri desert as we drew near to the plaza or market squar
we met a cart drawn by two mule and led by a man who had a serap
wrap about hi nose and mouth as though it were still the hour befor
the dawn over the content of thi cart a black cloth wa thrown
beneath which were outlin shape that suggestedbut no it could not
be onli why did antonio cross himself and mutter muert or some such
word
now we were in the plaza thi plaza where in happier time the
band would plai for all mexican ar music and the popul of
san jose wa wont to traffic in the dai and enjoi itself at night wa
border by an arch colonnad in it centr stood a basin of water
flow from a stone fountain of quaint and charm design
look at all those peopl sleep said emma as we pass five or six
form that veri small and quiet lai each under a blanket beneath on
of the arch why there ar a lot more just ly down over there
what funni folk to go to bed in public in the afternoon and she
point to a number of men women and children who seem to be get
up throw themselv down and turn round and round upon mattress
and bed of leav in the shadow of the arcad which we approach
present we were within three pace of thi arcad and as we rode up
an ag hag drew a blanket from on of the prostrat form reveal
a young woman over whom she proceed to pour water that she had drawn
from a fountain on glanc wa enough for me the poor creatur face
wa shapeless with confluent smallpox and her bodi a sight which i will
not describ i who wa a doctor could not be mistaken although as
it chanc i had never seen a case of smallpox befor the truth is
that although i have no fear of ani other human ailment smallpox ha
alwai terrifi me
for thi i am not to blame the fear is a part of my natur instil
into it doubtless by the shock which my mother receiv befor my birth
when she learn that her husband had been attack by thi horribl
sick so great and vivid wa my dread that i refus a veri
good appoint at a smallpox hospit and although i had sever
opportun of attend these case i declin to undertak them
and on thi account suffer somewhat in reput among those who knew
the fact inde my natur abhorr went even further as to thi
dai it is onli with someth of an effort that i can bring myself to
inspect the vesicl caus by vaccin whether thi is becaus
of their similar to those of smallpox or ow to the natur
associ which exist between them i cannot tell that it is real
enough howev mai be judg by the fact that terrifi as i wa at
smallpox and convinc as i have alwai been of the prophylact power
of vaccin i could never forc myselfuntil an occas to be told
ofto submit to it in infanc no doubt i wa vaccin for the
oper ha left a small and veri faint cicatrix on my arm but
infantil vaccin if unrep is but a feebl protect in
later life
unconsci i pull upon the bridl and the tire mule stop
malign smallpox i mutter and that fool is try to treat it
with cold water
reader of prescott mai rememb that when thi terribl
diseas wa first introduc by a negro slave of navaez and
kill out million of the popul of mexico the
unfortun aztec tri to treat it with cold water oddli
enough when some year ago the writer wa travel in a
part of mexico where smallpox wa preval it came to hi
notic that thi system is still follow among the indian
as thei alleg with good result
the old woman look up and saw me si senor ingles she said with a
ghastli smile viruela viruela and she went on gabbl someth
which i could not understand
she sai broke in antonio nearli quarter peopl dead and plenti
sick
for heaven sake let us get out of thi i said to emma who seat
on the other mule wa stare horrorstruck at the sight
oh she said you ar a doctor cant you help the poor thing
what and leav you to shift for yourself
never mind me dr thern i can go on to the hacienda or if you
like i will stai too i am not afraid i wa revaccin last year
dont be foolish i answer roughli i could not dream of expos
you to such risk also it is imposs for me to do ani good here
alon and without medicin come on at onc and seiz her mule by
the bridl i led it along the road that ran through the town toward the
hacienda on the height abov
ten minut later we were ride in the great courtyard the place
seem strang lifeless and silent inde the plaintiv mew of a
cat wa the onli sound to be heard present howev a dog appear
out of an open doorwai it wa a larg anim of the mastiff breed such
as might have been expect to bark and becom aggress to stranger
but thi it did not do inde it ran forward and greet us
affection we dismount and knock at the doubl door but no
on answer final we enter and the truth becam clear to usth
hacienda wa desert a littl burial ground attach to the chapel
told us why for in it were sever freshlymad grave evid of
peon or other servant and in an enclosur where lai inter
some depart member of the gomez famili anoth unsod mound we
discov afterward that it wa that of the senor gomez emma uncl
by marriag
the footstep of smallpox i said point to the grave we must go
on
emma wa too overcom to object for she believ that it wa her aunt
who slept beneath that mound so onc more we mount the weari mule
but we did not get far within half a mile of the hacienda we were met
by two arm rural who told us plainli that if we attempt to go
further thei would shoot
then we understood we had penetr a smallpox cordon and must
stop in it until forti dai after the last trace of the diseas had
vanish thi in a wild part of mexico where at that time vaccin
wa but littl practis and medic assist almost entir lack
would not be until half or more of the unprotect popul wa dead
and mani of the remaind were blind deafen or disfigur
back we crept to the desert hacienda and there in thi hideou nest
of smallpox we took up our quarter choos out of the mani in the
great pile sleep room that had evid not been us for month
or year food we did not lack for sheep and goat were strai about
untend while in the garden we found fruit and veget in plenti
and in the pantri flour and other store
at first emma wa daze and crush by fatigu and emot but she
recov her spirit after a night sleep and on learn from
antonio who wa told it by some peon that it wa not her aunt that
the smallpox had kill but her uncl by marriag whom she had never
seen have no fear of the diseas inde she becam quit resign
and calm for the strang and novelti of the posit absorb
and interest her also to my alarm it excit her philanthrop
instinct her great idea be to turn the hacienda into a
convalesc smallpox hospit of which she wa to be the nurs and
i the doctor inde she refus to abandon thi mad scheme until
i point out that in the event of ani of our patient dy most
probabl we should both be murder for wizard with the evil ey as a
matter of fact without medicin or assist we could have done littl
or noth
oh what a pestil wa that of which for three week or so we were
the daili wit for from the flat roof of the hacienda we could
see straight on to the plaza of the littl town and when at night we
could not see still we could hear the wail of the dy and bereav
the etern clang of the church bell rung to scare awai the demon of
diseas and the midnight mass chant by the priest that grew faint
and fainter as their brotherhood dwindl until at last thei ceas
and so it went on in the taint stricken place until the live were
not enough to buri the dead or to do more than carri food and water to
the sick
it would seem that about twelv year befor a philanthrop american
enthusiast arm with a letter of recommend from whoever at that
date wa presid of mexico and escort by a small guard descend
upon san jose to vaccin it for a few dai all went well for the
enthusiast wa a good doctor who understood how to treat ophthalmia and
to oper for squint both of which complaint were preval in san
jose then hi first vaccin patient develop vesicl and the
troubl began the end of the matter wa that the local priest a veri
ignor class of men interf declar that smallpox wa a trial
sent from heaven which it wa impiou to combat and that in ani case
vaccin wa the wors diseas of the two
as the viruela had scarc visit san jose within the memori of man
and the vesicl look alarm the popul true children of the
church agre with their pastor and from pure religi motiv
hoot and stone the philanthrop americano and hi guard out of the
district now thei and their innoc children were reap the fruit
of the pieti of these conscienti objector
after the first fortnight thi exist in an atmospher of diseas
becam absolut terribl to me not an hour of the dai pass that i
did not imagin some symptom of smallpox and everi morn when we met
at breakfast i glanc at emma with anxieti the shadow of the thing lai
deep upon my nerv and i knew well that if i stop there much longer
i should fall a victim to it in the bodi in thi emerg by mean
of antonio i open negoti with the offic of the rural
and final after much secret bargain it wa arrang that in
consider of a sum of two hundr dollarsfor by good luck i had
escap from the brigand with my moneyour flight through the cordon
of guard should not be observ in the dark
we were to start at nine oclock on a certain night at a quarter to
that hour i went to the stabl to see that everyth wa readi and in
the courtyard outsid of it found antonio seat against the water tank
groan and writh with pain in the back on look show me that
he had develop the usual symptom so feel that no time wa to be
lost i saddl the mule myself and took them round
where is antonio ask emma as she mount
he ha gone on ahead i answer to be sure that the road is clear
he will meet us beyond the mountain
poor antonio i wonder what becam of him he wa a good fellow and i
hope that he recov it griev me much to leav him but after all
i had my own safeti to think of and still more that of emma who had
grown veri dear to me perhap on dai i shall find him beyond the
mountain but if so that is a meet from which i expect no joi
the rest of our journei wa strang enough but it ha noth to do
with thi histori inde i have onli touch upon these long past
adventur in a far land becaus thei illustr the curiou fatal by
the work of which everi import event of my life ha taken place
under the dread shadow of smallpox i wa born under that shadow i
wed under it ibut the rest shall be told in it proper order
in the end we reach mexico citi in safeti and there emma and i were
marri ten dai later we were on board ship steam for england
chapter iii
sir john bell
now it is that i came to the great and terribl event of my life which
in it result turn me into a fals wit and a fraud and bound
upon my spirit a weight of bloodguilti greater than a man is
often call upon to bear as i have not scrupl to show i have
constitut weaknessesmor i am a sinner i know it i have sin
against the code of my profess and have preach a doctrin i knew
to be fals us all my skill and knowledg to confus and pervert the
mind of the ignor and yet i am not altogeth respons for these
sin which in truth in the first place were forc upon me by shame and
want and afterward by the necess of my ambit inde in that
dark and desper road of deceit there is no room to turn the step
onc taken can never be retrac
but if i have sin how much greater is the crime of the man who swore
awai my honour and forc me through those gatewai sure on hi head
and not on mine should rest the burden of my deed yet he prosper all
hi life and i have been told that hi death wa happi and painless
thi man career furnish on of the few argument that to my
sceptic mind suggest the exist of a place of futur reward and
punish for how is it possibl that so great a villain should reap
no fruit from hi rich sow of villaini if it is possibl then
verili thi world is the real hell wherein the wick ar lord and the
good their helpless and hopeless slave
emma becker when she becam my wife brought with her a small dowri of
about five thousand dollar or a thousand pound and thi sum we both
agre would be best spent in start me in profession life it wa
scarc suffici to enabl me to bui a practic of the class which
i desir so i determin that i would set to work to build on up as
with my abil and record i wa certain that i could do by prefer
i should have wish to begin in london but there the avenu to success
is choke and i had not the mean to wait until by skill and hard work
i could forc my wai along it
london be out of the question i made up my mind to try my fortun
in the ancient citi of dunchest where the name of thern wa still
rememb as my grandfath and father had practis there befor
me i journei to the place and made inquiri to find that although
there were plenti of medic men of a sort there wa onli on whose
competit i had caus to fear of the other some had no presenc
some no skill and some no charact inde on of them wa known to
drink
with sir john bell whose good fortun it wa to be knight in
recognit of hi attend upon a royal duchess who chanc to
contract the measl while stai in the town the case wa differ
he began life as assist to my father and when hi health fail
purchas the practic from him for a miser sum which as he wa
practic in possess my father wa oblig to accept from that
time forward hi success met with no check by no mean a master of hi
art sir john suppli with assur what he lack in knowledg and
aton for hi mistak by the readi of a bluff and oldfashion
sympathi that wa transpar to few
in short if ever a faux bonhomm exist sir john bell wa the man
needless to sai he wa as popular as he wa prosper such of the
practic of dunchest as wa worth have soon fell into hi hand
and few inde were the guinea that slip out of hi finger into the
pocket of a poorer brother also he had a larg consult connect
in the counti but if hi earn were great so were hi spend for
it wa part of hi system to accept civic and magisteri offic and to
entertain larg in hi offici capac thi meant that the monei
went out as fast as it came in and that howev much wa earn more
wa alwai need
when i visit dunchest to make inquiri i made a point of call on
sir john who receiv me in hi best heavyfath manner take
care to inform me that he wa keep lord soandso wait in hi
consultingroom in order to give me audienc go straight to the
point i told him that i thought of start to practis in dunchest
which inform i could see pleas him littl
of cours my dear boi he said you be your father son i should
be delight and would do everyth in my power to help you but at
the same time i must point out that were galen or jenner or harvei
to reappear on earth i doubt if thei could make a decent live in
dunchest
all the same i mean to have a try sir john i answer cheerfulli
i suppos you do not want an assist do you
let me see i think you said you were marri did you not
ye i answer well know that sir john have dispos of hi
elder daughter to an incompet person of our profess who had
becom the plagu of hi life wa desir of put the second to
better us
no my dear boi no i have an assist alreadi and he sigh thi
time with genuin emot if you come here you will have to stand upon
your own leg
quit so sir john but i shall still hope for a few crumb from the
master tabl
ye ye thern in anyth of that sort you mai reli upon me and
he bow me out with an effus smile
to poison the crumb i thought to myself for i wa never for
on moment deceiv as to thi man charact
a fortnight later emma and i came to dunchest and took up our abod in
a quaint redbrick hous of the queen ann period which we hire for a
not extravag rent of 80 pound a year although the posit of thi
hous wa not fashion noth could have been more suitabl from
a doctor point of view as it stood in a littl street near the
marketplac and absolut in the centr of the citi moreov it had
two beauti recept chamber on the ground floor oakpanel and
with carv adam mantelpiec which made excel waitingroom for
patient some time pass howev and our thousand pound in which
the expens of furnish had made a consider hole wa melt
rapidli befor those room were put to a practic us both i and my
wife did all that we could to get practic we call upon peopl who
had been friend of my father and grandfath we attend missionari
and other meet of a nonpolit charact regardless of expens
we went so far as to ask old ladi to tea
thei came thei drank the tea and inspect the new furnitur on
of them even desir to see my instrument and when fear to give
offenc i compli and produc them she remark that thei were not
nearli so nice as dear sir john which had ivori handl cheerfulli
would i have shown her that if the handl were inferior the steel wa
quit servic but i swallow my wrath and solemnli explain that
it wa not medic etiquett for a young doctor to us ivori
begin to despair i appli for on or two minor appoint in
answer to advertis insert by the board of guardian and other
public bodi in each case wa i not onli unsuccess but men equal
unknown though with a greatli inferior colleg and hospit record
were chosen over my head at length suspect that i wa not be
fairli dealt by i made inquiri to discov that at the bottom of all
thi ill success wa none other than sir john bell it appear that in
sever instanc by the shrug of hi thick shoulder and shake of
hi ponder head he had prevent my be emploi inde in the
case of the public bodi with all of which he had author either
as an offici or as an honorari advis he had directli veto my
appoint by the oracular announc that after ampl inquiri among
medic friend in london he had satisfi himself that i wa not a
suitabl person for the post
when i had heard thi and convinc myself that it wa substanti
truefor i wa alwai too cautiou to accept the loos and unsift
gossip of a provinci towni think that for the first time in my life
i experienc the passion of hate toward a human be why should
thi man who wa so rich and power thu devot hi energi to the
destruct of a brother practition who wa struggl and poor
at the time i set it down to pure malic into which without doubt it
blossom at last not understand that in the first place on sir
john part it wa in truth terror born of hi own consciou mediocr
like most inferior men he wa quick to recognis hi master and
either in the cours of our convers or through inquiri that
he made concern me he had come to the conclus that so far as
profession abil wa concern i wa hi master therefor be
a creatur of petti and dishonest mind he determin to crush me befor
i could assert myself
now have ascertain all thi beyond reason doubt there were
three cours open to me to make a public attack upon sir john to go
awai and try my fortun elsewher or to sit still and await event a
more impetu man would have adopt the first of these altern
but my experi of life confirm as it wa by the advic of emma
who wa a shrewd and farse woman soon convinc me that if i
did so i should have no more chanc of success than would an egg which
undertook a crusad against a brick wall doubtless the egg might stain
the wall and gather the fli of gossip about it stain but the end
of it must be that the wall would still stand wherea the egg would no
longer be an egg the second plan had more attract but my resourc
were now too low to allow me to put it into practic therefor have
no other choic i wa forc to adopt the third and exercis
that divin patienc which characteris the eastern nation but is so
lack in our own to attend humbl upon fate until it should pleas it
to deal to me a card that i could plai
in time fate dealt to me that card and my long suffer wa reward
for it prove a veri ac of trump it happen thu
about a year after i arriv in dunchest i wa elect a member of the
citi club it is a pleasant place where ladi ar admit to lunch
and i us it a good deal in the hope of make acquaint who might
be us to me among the habitu of thi club wa a certain major
selbi who have retir from the armi and be without occup
wa gener to be found in the smoke or billiard room with a larg
cigar between hi teeth and a whiski and soda at hi side in face the
major wa florid and what peopl call healthylook an appear
that to a doctor ey veri often convei no assur of physic
wellb be a genialmann man he would fall into convers
with whoever might be near to him and thu i came to be slightli
acquaint with him in the cours of our chat he frequent mention
hi ailment which as might be expect in the case of such a
luxuri liver were gouti in their origin
on afternoon when i wa sit alon in the smokingroom major selbi
came in and limp to an armchair
hullo major have you got the gout again i ask jocos
no doctor at least that pompou old beggar bell sai i havent
my leg ha been so confoundedli pain and stiff for the last few dai
that i went to see him thi morn but he told me that it wa onli a
touch of rheumat and gave me some stuff to rub it with
oh and did he look at your leg
not he he sai that he can tell what my ailment ar with the width of
the street between us
inde i said and some other men come in the matter drop
four dai later i wa in the club at the same hour and again major
selbi enter thi time he walk with consider difficulti and
i notic an express of pain and malais upon hi rubicund
counten he order a whiski and soda from the servant and then sat
down near me
rheumat no better major i ask
no i went to see old bell about it again yesterdai but he poohpooh
it and tell me to go on rub in the liniment and get the footman to
help when i am tire well i obei order but it hasnt done me much
good and how the deuc rheumat can give a fellow a bruis on the
leg i dont know
a bruis on the leg i said astonish
ye a bruis on the leg and if you dont believ me look here
and drag up hi trouser he show me below the knee a larg
inflam patch of a duski hue in the centr of which on of the vein
could be felt to be hard and swollen
ha sir john bell seen that i ask
not he i want him to look at it but he wa in a hurri and said i
wa just like an old woman with a sore on show so i gave it up
well if i were you id go home and insist upon hi come to look at
it
what do you mean doctor he ask grow alarm at my manner
oh it is a nasti place that is all and i think that when sir john
ha seen it he will tell you to keep quiet for a few dai
major selbi mutter someth uncomplimentari about sir john and then
ask me if i would come home with him
i cant do that as a matter of medic etiquett but ill see you into
a cab no i dont think i should drink that whiski if i were you you
want to keep yourself cool and quiet
so major selbi depart in hi cab and i went home and have noth
better to do turn up my note on variou case of venou thrombosi
or bloodclot in the vein which i had treat at on time or anoth
while i wa still read them there came a violent ring at the bell
follow by the appear of a veri agit footman who gasp out
pleas sir come to my master major selbi he ha been taken ill
i cant my good man i answer sir john bell is hi doctor
i have been to sir john sir but he ha gone awai for two dai to
attend a patient in the countri and the major told me to come for you
then i hesit no longer as we hurri to the hous which wa close
at hand the footman told me that the major on reach home took a cup
of tea and sent for a cab to take him to sir john bell as he wa in the
act of get into the cab suddenli he fell backward and wa pick
up pant for breath and carri into the diningroom by thi time we
had reach the hous of which the door wa open as we approach it
by mr selbi herself who seem in great distress
dont talk now but take me to your husband i said and wa led into
the diningroom where the unfortun man lai groan on the sofa
glad youv come he gasp i believ that fool bell ha done for
me
ask those present in the room a brother and a grownup son of the
patient to stand back i made a rapid examin then i wrote a
prescript and sent it round to the chemistit contain ammonia i
rememberand order hot foment to be place upon the leg while
these matter were be attend to i went with the relat into
anoth room
what is the matter with him doctor ask mr selbi
it is i think a case of what is call bloodclot which ha form
in the vein of the leg i answer part of thi clot ha been
detach by exert or possibl by rub and travel upward
ha becom impact in on of the pulmonari arteri
is it seriou ask the poor wife
of cours we must hope for the best i said but it is my duti to
tell you that i do not myself think major selbi will recov how long
he will last depend upon the size of the clot which ha got into the
arteri
oh thi is ridicul broke in mr selbi my brother ha been under
the care of sir john bell the ablest doctor in dunchest who told him
sever time that he wa suffer from noth but rheumat and
now thi gentleman start a total differ theori which if it
were true would prove sir john to be a most careless and incompet
person
i am veri sorri i answer i can onli hope that sir john is right
and i am wrong so that there mai be no subsequ doubt as to what i
have said with your leav i will write down my diagnosi and give it to
you
when thi wa done i return to the patient and mr selbi take
my diagnosi telegraph the substanc of it to sir john bell for hi
opinion in due cours the answer arriv from sir john regret that
there wa no train by which he could reach dunchest that night
give the name of anoth doctor who wa to be call in and ad
incauti enough dr thern diagnosi is pure theoret and
such as might be expect from an inexperienc man
meanwhil the unfortun major wa dy he remain consciou to the
last and in spite of everyth that i could do suffer great pain
amongst other thing he gave an order that a postmortem examin
should be made to ascertain the caus of hi death
when mr selbi had read the telegram from sir john he hand it to me
sai it is onli fair that you should see thi
i read it and have ask for and obtain a copi await the
arriv of the other doctor befor take my departur when at length
he came major selbi wa dead
two dai later the postmortem wa held there were present at it
sir john bell myself and the third medico dr jeffri it is
unnecessari to go into detail but in the issu i wa prove to
be absolut right had sir john taken the most ordinari care and
precaut hi patient need not have diedinde hi death wa caus
by the treatment the rub of the leg detach a portion of the clot
that might easili have been dissolv by rest and local applic as
it wa it went to hi lung and he di
when he saw how thing were go sir john tri to minimis matter
but unfortun for him i had my written diagnosi and a copi of hi
telegram document from which he could not escap nor could he deni
the result of the postmortem which took place in the presenc and
with the assist of the third practition a sound and independ
though not a veri success man
when everyth wa over there wa someth of a scene sir john
assert that my conduct had been impertin and unprofession i
repli that i had onli done my duti and appeal to dr jeffri who
remark drili that we had to deal not with opinion and theori but
with fact and that the fact seem to bear me out on learn the
truth the rel who until now had been against me turn upon
sir john and reproach him in strong term after which thei went awai
leav us face to face there wa an awkward silenc which i broke
by sai that i wa sorri to have been the unwil caus of thi
unpleas
you mai well be sorri sir sir john answer in a cold voic that wa
yet aliv with anger see that by your action you have expos me to
insult i who have practis in thi citi for over thirti year and who
wa your father partner befor you were in your cradl well it
is natur to youth to be impertin todai the laugh is your dr
thern tomorrow it mai be mine so goodafternoon and let us sai no
more about it and brush by me rude he pass from the hous
i follow him into the street watch hi thick squar form of which
even the back seem to express sullen anger and determin at a
distanc of a few yard stood the brother of the dead man mr selbi
talk to dr jeffri on of whom made some remark that caught sir
john ear he stop as though to answer then chang hi mind
turn hi head and look back at me my sight is good and i could see
hi face clearli on it wa a look of malign that wa not pleasant to
behold
i have made a bad enemi i thought to myself well i am in the
right on must take risk in life and it is better to be hate than
despis
major selbi wa a wellknown and popular man whose sudden death had
excit much sympathi and local interest which were intensifi when
the circumst connect with it becam public properti
on the follow dai the lead citi paper publish a report of the
result of the postmortem which doubtless had been furnish by the
rel and with it an editori note
in thi paragraph i wa spoken of in veri complimentari term my
medic distinct were allud to and the confid belief wa
express that dunchest would not be slow to avail itself of my skill
and talent sir john bell wa not so lightli handl hi gross error of
treatment in the case of the deceas wa it is true slur over but
some sarcast and disparag remark were aim at him under cover of
comparison between the old and the new school of medic practition
chapter iv
stephen strong goe bail
great ar the us of advertis when i went into my consultingroom
after breakfast that dai i found three patient wait to see me on
of them a member of a lead famili in the citi
here wa the begin of my success whatev time mai remain to
me todai in a sens my life is finish i am a brokenheart and
discomfit man with littl more to fear and noth to hope therefor
i mai be believ when i sai that in these page i set down the truth
and noth but the truth not attempt to palliat my conduct where
it ha been wrong nor to prais myself even when prais mai have been
due perhap then it will not be count conceit when i write that
in my best dai i wa realli a master of my trade to my faculti for
diagnosi i have i think allud it amount to a gifta touch
or two of my finger would often tell me what other doctor could
not discov by prolong examin to thi i ad a consider
masteri of the detail of my profess and a sympathet insight into
charact which enabl me to appli my knowledg to the best advantag
when a patient came to me and told me that hi symptom were thi
or that or the other i began by studi the man and form my own
conclus as to hi tempera charact and probabl past it
wa thi method of mine of studi the individu as a whole and hi
ailment as someth spring from and natur to hi physic and
spiritu entiti that so far as gener principl can be appli to
particular instanc often gave me a grip of the evil and enabl
me by deal with the gener caus to strike at it immedi
manifest my axiom wa that in the human subject mind is king the
mind command the bodi obei from thi follow the corollari that the
realli great doctor howev trivial the complaint should alwai begin
by try to understand the mind of hi patient to follow the cours of
it work and estim their result upon hi physic natur
necessarili there ar mani case to which thi rule doe not seem to
appli those of contagi sick for instanc or those of surgeri
result from accid and yet even there it doe appli for the
condit of the mind mai predispos to infect and to recoveri
or collaps in the instanc of the suffer from injuri but these
question of predisposit and consequ ar too great to argu here
though even the most ruleofthumb villag practition with a black
draught in on hand and a pot of ointment in the other will agre that
thei admit of a wide applic
at least it is to these primari principl over and abov my technic
skill that i attribut my success while i wa success that at ani
rate wa undoubt dai by dai my practic grew to such an extent
inde that on make up my book at the end of the second year i
found that dure the preced twelv month i had taken over 900
pound in fee and wa ow about 300 pound more most of thi balanc
howev i wrote off as a bad debt sinc i made it a custom never
to refus a patient mere becaus he might not be abl to pai me i
charg larg fee for a doctor gain noth by be cheap but if i
thought it inexpedi i did not attempt to collect them
after thi matter of the inquest on major selbi the relat between
sir john bell and myself were veri strainedin fact for a while
he refus to meet me in consult when thi happen without
attempt to criticis hi action i alwai insist upon retir from
the case sai that it wa not for me a young man to stand in the
path of on of so great experi and reput as might be expect
thi moder result in my triumph for the time came when sir
john thought it wise to waiv hi object and to recognis me
profession then i knew that i had won the dai for in that equal
field i wa hi master never onc that i can rememb did he ventur
to revers or even to cavil at my treatment at ani rate in my presenc
though doubtless he criticis it freeli elsewher
and so i flourish and as i wax he wane until calcul my
chanc with my wife i wa abl to prophesi that if no accid or
illchanc occur to stop me within anoth three year i should be
the lead practition in dunchest while sir john bell would occupi
the second place
but i had reckon without hi malic for although i knew thi to be
inveter i had underr it probabl effect and in due cours the
illchanc happen it came about in thi wise
when we had been marri someth over two year my wife found herself
expect to becom a mother as the event drew near she express great
anxieti that i should attend upon her to thi howev i object
strenuouslyfirst becaus i cannot bear to see ani on to whom i am
attach suffer pain and secondli becaus i knew that my affect
and person anxieti would certainli unnerv me except in case of the
utmost necess no man in my opinion should doctor himself or hi

in excus of a refus but check myself becaus i wa sure that he
would interpret it as a rebuff and in consequ hate me more bitterli
than ever so in the end i accept hi offer gratefulli and we part
when i told emma she wa a littl upset but be a sensibl woman she
soon saw the forc of my argument and fell in with the situat
in truth unselfish creatur that she wa she thought more of the
advantag that would accru to me by thi formal buri of the hatchet

hope for the best and look you here when a fellow call out to you
anoth time just you stop to listen
to dwell on all that follow would serv no good purpos and inde
what is the us of set down the detail of so much forgotten miseri
in a week my belov wife wa dead and in ten dai ladi colford had
follow her into the dark then it wa that to complet my own
destruct i commit an act of folli for meet sir john bell in
my mad grief i wa fool enough to tell him i knew that my wife death
and indirectli that of ladi colford were due to hi improp treatment
and neglect of precaut
i need not enter into the particular but thi in fact wa the case
he did not sai much in answer to my accus but mere repli
i make allow for you but dr thern it is time that somebodi
taught you that peopl reput cannot be slander with impun
instead of attack me i should recommend you to think of defend
yourself
veri soon i learn the mean of thi hint i think it wa within a
week of my wife funer that i heard that sir thoma colford togeth
with all hi relat and those of the deceas ladi were absolut
furiou with me awak from my stupor of grief i wrote a letter to
sir thoma express my deep regret at the misfortun that i had been
the innoc mean of bring upon him to thi letter i receiv a
repli by hand scrawl upon half a sheet of notepap it ran
sir thoma colford is surpris that dr thern should think it worth
while to add falsehood to murder
then for the first time i understood in what light my terribl
misfortun wa regard by the public a few dai later i receiv
further enlighten thi time from the lip of an inspector of
polic who call upon me with a warrant of arrest on the charg of
have done manslaught on the bodi of dame blanch colford
that night i spent in dunchest jail and next morn i wa brought
befor the bench of magistr who held a special session to try my
case the chairman whom i knew well veri kindli ask me if i did not
wish for legal assist i repli no i have noth to defend
which he seem to think a hard sai at ani rate he look surpris
on the other side counsel were emploi nomin on behalf of the
crown although in realiti the prosecut which in such a case wa
unusu if not unpreced had been set on foot and undertaken by the
colford famili
the inform wa read by the clerk in which i wa charg with
culpabl neglig and wilfulli do certain thing that caus the
death of blanch colford i stood there in the dock listen and
wonder what possibl evid could be adduc against me in support
of such a charg after the formal wit relat and doctor who
testifi to my be call in to attend on ladi colford to the cours
of the ill and the caus of death etc sir john bell wa call
now i thought to myself thi farc will come to an end for bell
will explain the fact
the counsel for the prosecut began by ask sir john variou
question concern the terribl maladi known as puerper fever and
especi with refer to it contagi then he pass on to
the event of the dai when i wa call in to attend upon ladi colford
sir john describ how he had visit my late wife and from variou
symptom which she had develop somewhat suddenli to hi grief and
surpris had come to the conclus that she had fallen victim to
puerper fever thi evid to begin with wa not true for
although he suspect the ailment on that afternoon he wa not sure of
it until the follow morn
what happen then sir john ask the counsel
leav my patient i hurri downstair to see dr thern and found
him just step from hi consultingroom into the hall
did he speak to you
ye he said how do you do and then ad befor i could tell him
about hi wife i am rather in luck todai thei ar call me in
to take ladi colford case i said i wa glad to hear it but that i
thought he had better let some on els attend her ladyship he look
astonish and ask why i said becaus my dear fellow i am afraid
that your wife ha develop puerper fever and the nurs tell
me that you were in her room not long ago he repli that it wa
imposs as he had look at her and thought her all right except for
a littl headach i said that i trust that i might be wrong but if
nearli forti year experi went for anyth i wa not wrong then
he flew into a passion and said that if anyth wa the matter with
hi wife it wa my fault as i must have brought the contagion or
neglect to take the usual antisept precaut i told him that
he should not make such statement without an atom of proof but
interrupt me he declar that fever or no fever he would attend
upon ladi colford as he could not afford to throw awai the best chanc
he had ever had i said my dear fellow dont be mad why if anyth
happen to her under the circumst i believ that after i have
warn you you would be liabl to be crimin prosecut for culpabl
neglig thank you he answer noth will happen to her i
know my own busi and i will take the chanc of that and then
befor i could speak again lift up hi bag from the chair on which
he had place it he open the front door and went out
i will not attempt especi after thi laps of year to describ
the feel with which i listen to thi amaz evid the black
wicked and the coldblood treacheri of the man overwhelm and
paralys me so that when after some further testimoni the chairman
ask me if i had ani question to put to the wit i could onli
stammer
it is a lie an infam lie
no no said the chairman kindli if you wish to make a statement
you will have an opportun of do so present have you ani
question to ask the wit
i shook my head how could i question him on such falsehood then came
the nurs who amidst a mass of other inform calmli swore that
stand on the second land whither she had accompani sir john
from hi patient room she heard a lengthi convers proceed
between him and me and caught the word i will take the chanc of
that spoken in my voic
again i had no question to ask but i rememb that thi nurs wa a
person who for a long while had been emploi by sir john bell and on
over whom he veri probabl had some hold
then i wa ask if i had ani wit but now that my wife wa dead
what wit could i callinde i could not have call her had
she been aliv then have been caution in the ordinari form that
whatev i said might be given as evid against me at my trial i wa
ask if i wish to make ani statement
i did make a statement of the fact so far as i knew them ad that
the evid of sir john bell and the nurs wa a tissu of falsehood
and that the former had been my constant enemi ever sinc i began to
practis in dunchest and more especi sinc the issu of a certain
case in the treatment of which i had prove him to be wrong when my
statement had been taken down and i had sign it the chairman after
a brief consult with hi companion announc that as those
concern had thought it well to institut thi prosecut in the face
of the uncontradict evid of sir john bell the bench had no option
but to send me to take my trial at the dunchest assiz which were to
be held on that dai month in order howev to avoid the necess
of commit me to jail thei would be prepar to take bail for my
appear in a sum of 500 pound from myself and 500 pound in two
sureti of 250 pound or on of the whole amount
now i look about me helplessli for i had no relat in dunchest
where i had not live long enough to form friend suffici true
to be will to thu identifi themselv publicli with a man in great
troubl
thank you for your kind i said but i think that i must go to
prison for i do not know whom to ask to go bail for me
as i spoke there wa a stir at the back of the crowd court and an
ungentl voic call out ill go bail for you lad
step forward whoever spoke said the clerk and a man advanc to the
tabl
he wa a curiou and not veri healthylook person of about fifti
year of ag illdress in seedi black cloth and a flame red tie
with a fat pale face a pugnaci mouth and a bald head on the top
of which isol hair stood up stiffli i knew him by sight for onc
he had argu with me at a lectur i gave on sanitari matter when i
wa told that he wa a draper by trade and although hi shop wa by
no mean among the most import that he wa believ to be on of the
richest men in dunchest also he wa a fierc faddist and a pillar of
strength to the advanc wing of the radic parti

calfworship crowd who call themselv vaccin thi bell is a
liar and that if he did it wasnt hi fault becaus it wa god will
that she should die and hed a been wrong to try and interfer with
him so name your sum and ill stand the shot
all of thi tirad had been said or rather shout in a strident voic
and in utter defianc of the repeat order of the chairman that he
should be silent mr stephen strong wa not a person veri amen to
author now howev when he had finish hi sai he not onli fill
in the bail bond but offer to hand up a chequ for 500 pound then and
there

chapter v
the trial
although it took place so long ago i suppos that a good mani peopl
still rememb the case of the queen versu thern which attract
a great deal of attent at the time the prosecut as i have said
wa set on foot by the relat of the deceas ladi colford who
be veri rich and power peopl were abl to secur the advocaci
of on of the most emin crimin lawyer of the dai with whom were
brief sundri almost equal emin junior inde no troubl or
expens wa spare that could help to ensur my convict
on my behalf also appear a wellknown qc and with him two junior
the judg who tri the case wa old and experienc but had the
reput of be sever and from it veri commenc i could see
that the perus of the deposit taken in the magistr court
where it will be rememb i wa not defend had undoubtedli bias
hi mind against me as for the juri thei were a respectablelook
quiet set of men who might be reli upon to do justic accord to
their light of those who were call from the panel and answer to
their name two by the wai were challeng by the crown and reject
becaus i wa told thei were profess antivaccinationist
on the appoint dai and hour speak in a veri crowd court counsel
for the crown open the case against me demonstr clearli that
in the pursuit of my own miser end i had sacrif the life of a
young highplac and love fellowcreatur and brought bereav
and desol upon her husband and famili then he proceed to call
evid which wa practic the same as that which had been given
befor the magistr although the husband and ladi colford nurs
were examin and on my behalf crossexamin at far greater length
after the adjourn for lunch sir john bell wa put into the
witnessbox where with a littl addit detail he repeat almost
word for word what he had said befor listen to him my heart sank
for he made an excel wit quiet selfcontain and to all
appear not a littl affect by the necess under which he found
himself of expos the evil do of a brother practition i notic
with dismai also that hi evid produc a deep effect upon the mind
of all present judg and juri not except
then came the crossexamin which certainli wa a brilliant
perform for under it were shown that from the begin sir john
bell had certainli born me illwil that to hi great chagrin i had
prove myself hi superior in a medic controversi and that the
fever which my wife contract wa in all human probabl due to hi
careless and want of precaut while in attend upon her when
thi crossexamin wa conclud the court rose for the dai and
be on bail i escap from the dock until the follow morn
i return to my hous and went up to the nurseri to see the babi who
wa a veri fine and healthi infant at first i could scarc bear to
look at thi child rememb alwai that indirectli it had been the
caus of it dear mother death but now when i wa so lone for
even those who call themselv my friend had fallen awai from me in
the time of trial i felt drawn toward the helpless littl thing
i kiss it and put it back into it cradl and wa about to leav
the room when the nurs a respect widow woman with a motherli air
ask me straight out what were my wish about the child and by what
name it wa to be baptis see that when i wa in jail she might not
be abl to ascertain them the good woman question made me winc
but recognis that in view of eventu these matter must be
arrang i took a sheet of paper and wrote down my instruct which
were briefli that the child should be name emma jane after it mother
and mine and that the nurs mr baker should take it to her cottag
and be paid a weekli sum for it mainten
have settl these disagre detail i went downstair but not to
the dinner that wa wait for me as after the nurs question i did
not feel equal to face the other domest leav the hous i walk
about the street seek some small eatingplac where i could dine
without be recognis as i wander along wearili i heard a harsh
voic behind me call me by name and turn found that the speaker
wa mr stephen strong even in the twilight there wa no possibl of
mistak hi flame red tie
you ar worri and tire doctor said the harsh voic why aint
you with your friend instead of tramp the street after that long
dai in court
becaus i have no friend left i answer for i had arriv at that
stage of humili when a man no longer care to cloak the truth
a look of piti pass over mr strong fat face and the line about
the pugnaci mouth soften a littl
is that so he said well young man your learn now what
happen to those who put their faith in fashion folk and not in the
lord rat cant scuttl from a sink ship faster than fashion
folk from a friend in troubl you come along and have a bit of supper
with me and my missi were humbl tradesfolk but perhap as thing
ar you wont mind that
i accept mr strong invit with gratitud inde hi kind
touch me lead me to hi princip shop we pass through it
and down a passag to a sittingroom heavili furnish with solid
horsehairs chair and a sofa in the exact centr of thi sofa
read by the light of a lamp with a pink shade which wa place on a
tabl behind her sat a prim greyhair woman dress in a black silk
dress and apron and a lace cap with lappet i notic at onc that the
right lappet wa larger than the left evid it had been made so
with the design of hide a patch of affect skin below the ear which
look to me as though it had been caus by the maladi call lupu
i notic further that the littl woman wa read an antivaccin
tract with a fear pictur of a diseas arm upon it cover
martha said mr strong dr thern whom theyr try at the court
yonder ha come in for supper dr thern that my wife
mr strong rose and offer her hand she wa a thin person with
rather refin featur a weak mouth and kindli blue ey
im sure you ar welcom she said in a small monoton voic ani
of stephen friend ar welcom and more especi those of them who
ar suffer persecut for the right
that is not exactli my case madam i answer for if i had done
what thei accus me of i should deserv hang but i did not do it
i believ you doctor she said for you have true ey also stephen
sai so but in ani case the death of the dear young woman wa god
will and if it wa god will how can you be respons
while i wa wonder what answer i should make to thi strang doctrin
a servant girl announc that supper wa readi and we went into the
next room to partak of a meal plain inde but of most excel
qualiti moreov i wa glad to find unlik hi wife who touch
noth but water that mr strong did not includ teetot among
hi eccentr on the contrari he produc a bottl of realli fine
port for my especi benefit
in the cours of our convers i discov that the strong who
had had no children devot themselv to the propag of variou
fad mr strong inde wa antieveryth but which is rather
uncommon in such a man had no extran delus that is to sai he
wa not a christian scientist or a blavatskyist or a great pyramidist
mr strong howev had never got farther than antivaccin to
her a holi caus for she set down the skin diseas with which she wa
constitution afflict to the credit or discredit of vaccin
practis upon her in her youth outsid of thi great and absorb
subject her mind occupi itself almost entir with that wellknown
but most harmless of the craze the theori that we anglosaxon ar the
progeni of the ten lost tribe of israel
steer clear of antivaccin i show an intellig sympathi
with her view and deduct concern the ten tribe which so
pleas the gentl littl woman that forget the uncertainti of my
futur movement she beg me to come and see her as often as i like
and in the meanwhil present me with a pile of literatur connect
with the suppos wander of the tribe thu began my acquaint
with my friend and benefactress martha strong
at ten oclock on the follow morn i return to the dock and the
nurs repeat her evid in corrobor of sir john testimoni
a search crossexamin show her not to be a veri trustworthi
person but on thi particular point it wa imposs to shake her
stori becaus there wa no stand ground from which it could be
attack then follow some expert evid wherebi amongst other
thing the crown prove to the juri the fearfulli contagi natur of
puerper fever which close the case for the prosecut after thi
my counsel reserv hi address call the onli testimoni i wa in
a posit to produc that of sever wit to charact and to
medic capac
when the last of these gentlemen none of whom were crossexamin
stood down my counsel address the court point out that my mouth
be close by the law of the landfor thi trial took place befor
the pass of the crimin evid acti wa unabl to go into the
box and give on oath my version of what had realli happen in thi
matter nor could i produc ani wit to disprov the stori which
had been told against me becaus unhappili no third person wa
present at the crucial moment now thi stori rest entir on the
evid of sir john bell and the nurs and if it wa true i must be
mad as well as bad sinc a doctor of my abil would well know that
under the circumst he would veri probabl carri contagion with the
result that a promis profession career might be ruin moreov
had he determin to risk it he would have taken extra precaut in
the sickroom to which he wa call and thi it wa prove i had not
done now the statement made by me befor the magistr had been put
in evid and in it i said that the tale wa an absolut invent
on the part of sir john bell and that when i went to see ladi colford
i had no knowledg whatsoev that my wife wa suffer from an
infecti ailment thi he submit wa the true version of the
stori and he confid ask the juri not to blast the career of
an abl and rise man but by their verdict to reinstat him in the
posit which he had temporarili and unjustli lost
in repli the lead counsel for the crown said that it wa neither
hi wish nor hi duti to strain the law against me or to put a wors
interpret upon the fact than thei would bear under the strictest
scrutini he must point out howev that if the content of hi
learn friend were correct sir john bell wa on of the wickedest
villain who ever disgrac the earth
in sum up the judg took much the same line the case that wa of a
charact upon which it wa unusu though perfectli allow to found
a crimin prosecut he point out rest sole upon the evid
of sir john bell corrobor as it wa by the nurs if that
evid wa correct then to satisfi my own ambit or greed i had
deliber risk and as the issu show had taken the life of a
ladi who in all confid wa entrust to my care incred as such
wicked might seem the juri must rememb that it wa by no mean
unpreced at the same time there wa a point that had been scarc
dwelt upon by counsel to which he would call their attent accord
to sir john bell account it wa from hi lip that i first learn
that my wife wa suffer from a peculiarli danger ailment yet in
hi report of the convers that follow between us which he gave
practic verbatim i had not express a singl word of surpris and
sorrow at thi dread intellig which to an affection husband
would be absolut overwhelm as it had been prove by the evid
of the nurs and elsewher that my relat with my young wife were
those of deep affect thi struck him as a circumst so peculiar
that he wa inclin to think that in thi particular sir john memori
must be at fault
there wa howev a wide differ between assum that a portion
of the convers had escap a witnesss memori and disbeliev all
that witnesss evid as the counsel for the crown had said if he
had not as he swore warn me and i had not as he swore refus to
listen to hi warn then sir john bell wa a moral monster that he
sir john at the begin of my career in dunchest had shown some
prejudic and animu against me wa inde admit doubtless be
human he wa not pleas at the advent of a brilliant young rival who
veri shortli proceed to prove him in the wrong in the instanc of on
of hi own patient but that he had conquer thi feel as a man of
gener impuls would natur do appear to be clear from the fact
that he had volunt to attend upon that rival wife in her ill
from all these fact the juri would draw what infer seem just
to them but he for on found it difficult to ask them to includ
among these the infer that a man who for more than a gener had
occupi a veri high posit among them whose reput both in and
out of hi profess wa great and who had receiv a special mark of
favour from the crown wa in truth an evilmind and most malevol
perjur yet if the statement of the accus wa to be accept that
would appear to be the case of cours howev there remain the
possibl that in the confus of a hurri interview i might have
misunderstood sir john bell word or that he might have misunderstood
mine or lastli as had been suggest that have come to the
conclus that sir john could not possibl form a trustworthi opinion
on the natur of my wife symptom without await their further
develop i had determin to neglect advic in which as a doctor
myself i had no confid
thi wa the gist of hi sum up but of cours there wa a great
deal more which i have not set down the juri wish to consid
their verdict retir an exampl that wa follow by the judg hi
departur wa the signal for an outburst of convers in the crowd
court which hum like a hive of startl bee the superintend of
polic who i imagin had hi own opinion of sir john bell and of the
valu of hi evid veri kindli place a chair for me in the dock
and there on that bad emin i sat to be studi by a thousand curiou
and for the most part unsympathet ey ladi colford had been veri
popular her husband and relat who were convinc of my guilt
and sought to be aveng upon me were veri power therefor the
fashion world of dunchest which wa doctor by sir john bell
wa against me almost to a woman
the juri were long in come back and in time i accustom myself
to the stare and comment and began to think out the problem of my
posit it wa clear to me that so far as my futur wa concern
it did not matter what verdict the juri gave in ani case i wa a ruin
man in thi and probabl in everi other countri and there opposit to
me sat the villain who with no excus of hot blood or the pressur of
sudden passion had deliber sworn awai my honour and livelihood he
wa chat easili to on of the counsel for the crown when present
he met my ey and in them read my thought i suppos that the man had
a conscienc somewher probabl inde hi treatment of me had not
been premedit but wa undertaken in a hurri to save himself from
wellmerit attack the lie onc told there wa no escap for him who
henceforth must sound iniqu to it depth
suddenli in the midst of hi convers sir john becam silent and
hi lip turn pale and trembl then remark abruptli that he
could wast no more time on thi miser busi he rose and left
the court evid the barrist to whom he wa talk had observ
to what thi chang of demeanour wa due for he look first at me in
the dock and next at sir john bell as recov hi pompos he made
hi wai through the crowd then he grew reflect and push hi wig
back from hi forehead he stare at the ceil and whistl to himself
softli
it wa veri evid that the juri found a difficulti in make up their
mind for minut after minut went by and still thei did not return
inde thei must have been absent quit an hour and a half when
suddenli the superintend of polic remov the chair which he had
given me and inform me that thei were come
with a curiou and imperson emot as a man might consid a case
in which he had no immedi concern i studi their face while on
by on thei file into the box the anxieti had been so great and so
prolong that i rejoic it wa at length come to it end whatev
that end might be
the judg have return to hi seat on the bench in the midst of the
most intens silenc the clerk ask the juri whether thei found the
prison guilti or not guilti rise to hi feet the foreman a dapper
littl man with a rapid utter said or rather read from a piec of
paper not guilti but we hope that in futur dr thern will be more
care about convei infect
that is a most improp verdict broke in the judg with irrit
for it acquit the accus and yet impli that he is guilti dr
thern you ar discharg i repeat that i regret that the juri should
have thought fit to add a veri uncalledfor rider to their verdict
i left the dock and push my wai through the crowd outsid the
courthous i came face to face with sir thoma colford a sudden
impuls move me to speak to him
sir thoma i began now that i have been acquit by a juri
prai dr thern he broke in sai no more for the less said the
better it is useless to offer explan to a man whose wife you have
murder
but sir thoma that is fals when i visit ladi colford i knew
noth of my wife condit
sir he repli in thi matter i have to choos between the word of
sir john bell who although unfortun my wife did not like him as
a doctor ha been my friend for over twenti year and your word with
whom i have been acquaint for on year under these circumst i
believ sir john bell and that you ar a guilti man nine peopl out
of everi ten in dunchest believ thi and what is more the juri
believ it also although for reason which ar easili to be understood
thei show merci to you and turn on hi heel he walk awai from
me
i also walk awai to my own desol home and sit down in the
empti consultingroom contempl the utter ruin that had overtaken
me my wife wa gone and my career wa gone and to whatev part of the
earth i might migrat an evil reput would follow me and all thi
through no fault of mine
whilst i still sat brood a man wa shown into the room a smile
littl blackcoat person in whom i recognis the manag clerk of
the firm of solicitor that had conduct the case for the prosecut
not done with your troubl yet dr thern i fear he said
cheerfulli out of the crimin wood into the civil swamp and he
laugh as he hand me a paper
what is thi i ask
statement of claim in the case of colford v thern damag laid at
10000 pound which i daresai you will agre is not too much for the
loss of a young wife you see doctor sir thoma is downright wild with
you and so ar all the late ladi peopl as he cant lock you up
he intend to ruin you by mean of an action if he had listen to me
that is what he would have begun with leav the crimin law alon
it a nasti treacher thing is the crimin law and you cant be
sure of your man howev black thing mai look against him i never
thought thei could convict you doctor never for as the old judg
said you see it is quit unusu to prosecut crimin in case of
thi natur and the juri wont send a man to jail for a littl mistak
of the sort but thei will cop you in damag a thousand or fifteen
hundr and then the best thing that you can do will be to go bankrupt
or perhap you had better clear befor the trial come on
i groan aloud but the littl man went on cheerfulli
same solicitor i suppos ill take the other thing to them so as
not to bother you more than i can help goodafternoon im downright
glad that thei didnt convict you and as for old bell he as mad as a
hatter though of cours everybodi know what the juri meantth judg
wa pretti straight about it wasnt hehe choos to think that it
amount to call him a liar well now i come to think of it there
ar on or two thingsso perhap he is goodafternoon doctor let
see you have the origin and i will take the duplic and he
vanish
when the clerk had gone i went on think thing were wors than i had
believ for it seem that i wa not even clear of my legal troubl
alreadi thi trial had cost me a great deal and i wa in no posit
to stand the financi strain of a second appear in the law court
also the man wa right although i had been acquit on the crimin
charg if the same evid were given by sir john bell and the nurs
in a civil action without ani manner of doubt i should be cast in heavi
damag well i could onli wait and see what happen
but wa it worth while wa anyth worth while the world had treat
me veri cruelli a villain had li awai my reput and the world
believ him so that henceforth i must be on of it outcast and
black sheep an object of piti and contempt among the member of my
profess it wa doubt whether have been thu expos and made
bankrupt i could ever again obtain a respect practic inde the
most that i might hope for would be some small appoint on the west
coast of africa or ani other poison place which no on els would
be inclin to accept where i might liveuntil i di
the question that occur to me that even wa whether it would not
be wiser on the whole to accept defeat own myself beaten and ring
down the curtainnot a difficult matter for a doctor to deal with the
argument for such a cours were patent what were those against it
the exist of my child well by the time that she grew up if she
live to grow up all the troubl and scandal would be forgotten and
the effac of a discredit parent could be no great loss to her
moreov my life wa insur for 3000 pound in an offic that took the
risk of suicid
consider of religion these had ceas to have ani weight with me
i wa brought up to believ in a good and watch provid but the
event of the last few month had choke that belief if there wa a god
who guard us why should he have allow the exist of my wife to
be sacrif to the careless and all my hope to the villaini of
sir john bell the reason wa inconclus perhapsfor who can know
the end of the divinitybut it satisfi my mind at the time and for
the rest i have never realli troubl to reopen the question
the natur love of life for it own sake it had left me what more had
life to offer further what is call love of life frequent enough
is littl more than fear of the hereaft or of death and of the
physic act of death i had lost my terror shatter as i wa by sorrow
and shame inde at that moment i could have welcom it gladli sinc
to me it meant the perfect rest of oblivion
so in the end i determin that i would leav thi light hous of life
and go out into the dark night and at onc unhappi wa it for me and
for hundr of other human be that the decre of fate or chanc
brought my design to noth
first i wrote a letter to be hand to the report at the inquest for
public in the newspap in which i told the true stori of ladi
colford case and denounc bell as a villain whose perjuri had driven
me to selfmurd after thi i wrote a second letter to be given to
my daughter if she live to come to year of discret set out the
fact that brought me to my end and ask her to pardon me for have
left her thi done it seem that my worldli busi wa complet so
i set about leav the world
go to a medicin chest i reflect a littl final i decid on
prussic acid it after effect ar unpleas but it action is swift
and certain what did it matter to me if i turn black and smelt of
almond when i wa dead
chapter vi
the gate of dark
take the phial from the chest i pour an ampl but not an over dose
of the poison into a medicin glass mix it with a littl water so
that it might be easier to swallow i linger as long as i could over
these prepar but thei came to an end too soon
now there seem to be noth more to do except to transfer that littl
measur of white fluid from the glass to my mouth and thu to open
the great door at whose bolt and bar we stare blankli from the dai of
birth to the dai of death everi panel of that door is paint with a
differ pictur touch to individu tast some ar beauti and
some ar grim and some ar neutraltint and indefinit my favourit
pictur us to be on of a boat float on a misti ocean and in the
boat a man sleepingmyself dream happili dream alwai
but that pictur had gone now and in place of it wa on of black
not the tumultu gloom of a stormi night but dead cold unfathom
black without a doubt that wa what lai behind the dooronli
that so soon as ever my wine wa swallow and those mighti hing
began to turn i should see a wall of black thrust itself
twixt door and lintel ye it would creep forward now paus now
advanc until at length it wrap me round and stifl out my breath
like a death mask of cold clai then sight would die and sound would die
and to all etern there would be silenc silenc while the star
grew old and crumbl silenc while thei took form again far in the
void for ever and for ever dumb dread conquer silenc
that wa the onli real pictur the rest were mere effort of the
imagin and yet what if some of them were also true what if the
finish landscap that lai beyond the doomdoor wa but develop from
the faint sketch trace by the strive of our spiritto each man
hi own pictur but fill in perfect vivifi a thousandfold for
terror or for joi perfect and inconceiv
the thought wa fascin but not without it fear it wa
strang that a man who had abandon hope should still be haunt by
fearslik everyth els in the world thi is unjust for a littl
while five or ten minut not more than ten i would let my mind dwell
on that thought try to dig down to it root which doubtless drew
their strength from the foetid slime of human superstit try to
behold it topmost branch where thei wave in sparkl light no
that wa not the theori i must imagin those invis branch as
grim skeleton of whiten wood stand stirless in that atmospher of
overwhelm night
so i sat myself in a chair place the medicin glass with the draught
of bane upon the tabl befor me and to make sure that i did not
exce the ten minut near to it my travel clock as i sat thu
i fell into a dream or vision i seem to see myself stand upon the
world surround by familiar sight and sound there in the west the
sun sank in splendour and the sail of a windmil that turn slowli
between it orb and me were now bright as gold and now by contrast
black as thei dip into the shadow near the windmil wa a cornfield
and beyond the cornfield stood a cottag whenc came the sound of low
cattl and the voic of children down a path that ran through the
ripen corn walk a young man and a maid their arm twine about
each other while abov their head a lark pour out it song
but at my veri feet thi kindli earth and all that ha life upon it
vanish quit awai and there in it place seen through a giant
portal wa the realm of dark that i had pictureddark so
terribl so overpow and so ici that my live blood froze at
the sight of it present someth stir in the dark for it
trembl like shaken water a shape came forward to the edg of the
gatewai so that the light of the set sun fell upon it make it
visibl i look and knew that it wa the phantom of my lost wife
wrap in her last garment there she stood sad and eagerfac with
quickmov lip from which no echo reach my ear there she stood
beat the air with her hand as though to bar that path against
me
i awok with a start to see stand over against me in the gloom of
the doorwai not the figur of my wife come from the compani of the dead
with warn on her lip but that of stephen strong ye it wa he
for the light of the candl that i had lit when i went to seek the drug
fell full upon hi pale face and larg bald head
hullo doctor he said in hi harsh but not unkindli voic have a
nip and a nap eh what your tippl holland it look but it smell
more like peach brandi mai i tast it im a judg of holland and he
lift the glass of prussic acid and water from the tabl
in an instant my daze faculti were awak and with a swift motion i
had knock the glass from hi hand so that it fell upon the floor and
wa shatter
ah he said i thought so and now young man perhap you will
tell me why you were plai a trick like that
why i answer bitterli becaus my wife is dead becaus my name
is disgrac becaus my career is ruin becaus thei have commenc a
new action against me and if i live i must becom a bankrupt
and you thought that you could make all these thing better by kill
yourself doctor i didnt believ that you were such a fool you sai
you have done noth to be asham of and i believ you well then
what doe it matter what these folk think for the rest when a man
find himself in a tight place he shouldnt knock under he should
fight hi wai through your in a tight place i know but i wa onc
in a tighter ye i did what you have nearli donei went to jail on a
fals charg and fals evid but i didnt commit suicid i serv
my time and i think it craze me a bit though it wa onli a month at
ani rate i wa what thei call a crank when i came out which i wasnt
when i went in then i set to work and show up those for whom i had
done timeliv or dead theyll never forget stephen strong ill
warrantand after that i turn to and becam the head of the radic
parti and on of the richest men in dunchest why i might have been
in parliament half a dozen time over if i had chosen although i am
onli a draper now if i have done all thi why cant you who have
twice my brain and educ do as much
nobodi will emploi you i will find folk who will emploi you action
for damag ill stand the shot of that howev it goe i love a
lawsuit and a thousand or two wont hurt me and now i came round here
to ask you to supper and i think youll be better drink port with
stephen strong than hellfir with anoth tradesman whom i wont name
befor we go howev just give me your word of honour that there shall
be no more of thi sort of thing and he point to the broken glass
now or afterward as i dont want to be mix up with inquest
i promis i answer present
that will do said mr strong as he led the wai to the door
i need not dwell upon the further event of that even inasmuch
as thei were almost a repetit of those of the previou night
mr strong receiv me kindli in her fade fashion and after a few
inquiri about the trial sought refug in her favourit topic of the
lost tribe inde i rememb that she wa rather put out becaus i
had not alreadi master the book and pamphlet which she had given
me in the end notwithstand the weari of her feebl folli i
return home in much better spirit
for the next month or two noth of note happen to me except inde
that the action for damag brought against me by sir thoma colford
wa suddenli withdrawn although it never transpir publicli i believ
that the true reason of thi collaps wa that sir john bell flatli
refus to appear in court and submit himself to further examin
and without sir john bell there wa no evid against me but the
withdraw of thi action did not help me profession inde
the fine practic which i wa begin to get togeth had entir
vanish awai not a creatur came near my consultingroom and scarc
a creatur call me in the prosecut and the verdict of the juri
amount as it did to on of not proven onli had ruin me by now
my small resourc were almost exhaust and i could see that veri
shortli the time would come when i should no longer know where to turn
for bread for myself and my child
on morn as i wa sit in my consultingroom moodili read a
medic textbook for want of someth els to do the front door bell
rang a patient at last i thought to myself with a glow of hope
i wa soon undeceiv howev for the servant open the door and
announc mr stephen strong
how do you do doctor he said briskli you will wonder why i am here
at such an hour well it is on busi i want you to come with me to
see two sick children
certainli i said and we start
who ar the children and what is the matter with them i ask
present
son and daughter of a work bootmak name samuel as to what is
the matter with them you can judg of that for yourself he repli
with a grim smile
pass into the poorer part of the citi at length we reach a
cobbler shop with a few pair of roughlymad boot on sale in the
window in the shop sat mr samuel a dourlook man of about forti
here is the doctor samuel said strong
all right he answer hell find the missu and the kid in there
and a pretti sight thei ar i cant bear to look at them i cant
pass through the shop we went into a back room whenc came a sound
of wail stand in the room wa a careworn woman and in the bed lai
two children ag three and four respect i proceed at onc
to my examin and found that on child a boi wa in a state
of extrem prostrat and fever the greater part of hi bodi be
cover with a vivid scarlet rash the other child a girl wa
suffer from a terribl red and swollen arm the inflamm be
most mark abov the elbow both were case of palpabl and sever
erysipela and both of the suffer had been vaccin within five
dai
well said stephen strong well what the matter with them
erysipela i answer
and what caus the erysipela wa it the vaccin
it mai have been the vaccin i repli cautious
come here samuel call strong now then tell the doctor your
stori
there preciou littl stori about it said the poor man keep hi
back toward the afflict children i have been pull up three time
and fine becaus i didnt have the kid vaccin not be ani
believ in vaccin myself ever sinc my sister boi di of it
with hi head all cover with sore well i couldnt pai no more
fine so i told the missu that she might take them to the vaccin
offic and she did five or six dai ago and there that the end
of their vaccin and damn em to hell sai i and the poor fellow
push hi wai out of the room
it is quit unnecessari that i should follow all the detail of thi sad
case in the result despit everyth that i could do for him the boi
di though the girl recov both had been vaccin from the same
tube of lymph in the end i wa abl to forc the author to
have the content of tube obtain from the same sourc examin
microscop and subject to the cultur test thei were prove to
contain the streptococcu or germ of erysipela
as mai be imagin thi case caus a great stir and much public
controversi in which i took an activ part it wa seiz upon eagerli
by the antivaccin parti and i wa quot as the author for
it detail in repli the other side hint pretti broadli that i wa
a person so discredit that my testimoni on thi or ani other
matter should be accept with caution an unjust aspers which not
unnatur did much to keep me in the enemi camp inde it wa now
when i becam us to a great and rise parti that at length i found
friend without number who not content with give me their present
support took up the case on account of which i had stood my trial and
by their energi and the ventil of it detail did much to show how
greatli i had been wrong i did not and do not suppos that all thi
friendship wa disinterest but whatev it motiv it wa equal
welcom to a crush and desert man
by slow degre and without my make ani distinct pronounc on
the subject i came to be look upon as a lead light among the veri
small and select band of antivaccinationist men and as such to studi
the question exhaust hear that i wa thu engag stephen
strong offer me a handsom salari which i suppos came out of hi
pocket if i would consent to investig case in which vaccin
wa alleg to have result in mischief i accept the salari sinc
formal at ani rate it bound me to noth but a cours of inquiri
dure a search of two year i establish to my satisfact that
vaccin as for the most part it wa then perform that is from
arm to arm is occasion the caus of blood poison erysipela
abscess tuberculosi and other dread ailment these case i
publish without draw from them ani deduct whatev with the
result that i found myself summon to give evid befor the royal
commiss on vaccin which wa then sit at westminst when
i had given my evid which each case be well establish could
scarc be shaken some member of the commiss attempt to draw me
into gener statement as to the advantag or otherwis of the practic
of vaccin to the commun to these gentlemen i repli that as
my studi had been direct toward the effect of vaccin in
individu instanc onli the argument wa on upon which i prefer
not to enter
had i spoken the truth inde i should have confess my inabl to
support the antivaccinationist case sinc in my opinion few peopl who
have studi thi question with an open and imparti mind can deni
that jenner discoveri is on of the greatest boonsperhap after the
introduct of antisept and anaesthet the veri greatestthat
ha ever been bestow upon suffer human
if the reader ha ani doubt upon the point let him imagin a time
when as us to happen in the dai of our forefath almost everybodi
suffer from smallpox at some period of their live those escap
onli whose blood wa so fortifi by natur that the diseas could not
touch them let him imagin a state of affairsand there ar still
peopl live whose parent could rememb itwhen for a woman not to
be pit with smallpox wa to give her some claim to beauti howev
home might be her featur lastli let him imagin what all thi
mean what terror walk abroad when it wa common for smallpox to
strike a famili of children and when the parent themselv the
survivor of similar catastroph knew well that befor it left the
hous it would take it tith of those belov live let him look
at the brass in our old church and among the number of children
repres on them as kneel behind their parent let him note what
a larg proport prai with their hand open of these the most i
believ were cut off by smallpox let him search the regist and
thei will tell the same tale let him ask old peopl of what their
mother told them when thei were young of the work of thi pestil
in their youth final let him consid how it come about if
vaccin is a fraud that some nine hundr and ninetynin medic
men out of everi thousand not in england onli but in all civilis
countri place so firm a belief in it virtu ar the doctor of
the world all mad or all engag in a great conspiraci to suppress the
truth
these were my real view as thei must be the view of most intellig
and thought men but i did not think it necessari to promulg them
abroad sinc to do so would have been to depriv myself of such mean
of mainten as remain to me inde in those dai i told neither
more nor less than the truth evil result occasion follow the us
of bad lymph or unclean treatment after the subject had been inocul
thu most of the case of erysipela into which i examin aros not
from vaccin but from the dirti surround of the patient wound a
million children howev slightli and let fli settl on the wound
or dirt accumul in it and the result will be that a certain small
proport will develop erysipela quit independ of the effect of
vaccin
in the same wai some amount of inocul diseas must follow the
almost promiscu us of lymph taken from human be the danger is
perfectli prevent and ought long ago to have been prevent by
make it illeg under heavi penalti to us ani substanc except
that which ha been develop in calv and scientif treat with
glycerin when as i believ no hurt can possibl follow thi is the
verdict of scienc and as ten of thousand can testifi the common
experi of mankind
chapter vii
cross the rubicon
my appear as an expert befor the royal commiss gave me
consider import in the ey of a larg section of the
inhabit of dunchest it wa not the wealthiest or most influenti
section inde although in it were number some rich and power men
onc again i found myself with a wide and rapidli increas practic
and an incom that wa suffici for my need mankind suffer from
mani ailment besid that of smallpox inde in dunchest thi
question of the valu of vaccin wa at that time pure academ
as except for an occasion case there had been no outbreak of smallpox
for year now as i have said i wa a master of my trade and soon
prove myself compet to deal skilfulli with such ill surgic
or medic as i wa call upon to treat thu my practic grew
especi among the small tradespeopl and artisan who did not belong
to club but prefer to pai for a doctor in whom thei had confid
three year and more had gone by sinc that night on which i sat
opposit to a wineglass full of poison and wa the prei of vision
when onc again i receiv a call from stephen strong with thi
goodheart though misguid man and hi amiabl but weakmind
wife i had kept up an intimaci that in time ripen into genuin
friendship on everi sundai night and sometim often i took supper
with them and discuss with mr strong the import question of our
descent from the lost tribe and whether or no the lupu from which she
suffer wa the result of vaccin in infanc
ow to a press of patient to whom i wa oblig to attend i wa not
abl to receiv mr strong for nearli half an hour
thing ar a bit differ from what thei us to be doctor he said
as he enter the room look much the same as ever with the except
that now even hi last hair had gone leav him complet bald
there six more of them wait there and all except on can pai a
fee ye the luck ha turn for you sinc you were call in to attend
cobbler samuel children and you havent seen the top of it yet i can
tell you now what do you think i have come to see you about
cant sai i give it up
then i will tell you you saw in yesterdai paper that old brewer
hick the member for dunchest ha been rais to the peerag i
understand he told the govern that if thei kept him wait ani
longer he would stop hi subscript to the parti fund and as that
5000 pound a year thei gave in believ the seat to be a safe on
but that just where thei make their mistak for if we get the right
man the rad will win
and who is the right man
jame thern esq md he answer quietli
what on earth do you mean i ask how can i afford to spend from
1000 to 2000 pound upon a contest elect and as much more a year
in subscript and keep up the posit if i should chanc to be
return and how in the name of fortun can i be both a practis
physician and a member of parliament
ill tell you doctor for ever sinc your name wa put forward by
the liber council yesterdai i have seen these difficulti and been
think them out look here you ar still young handsom clever
and a capit speaker with a popular audienc also you ar veri
hardwork and would rise but youv no monei and onli what you
earn at your profess to live on which if you were a member of
parliament you couldnt continu to earn well such a man as you ar
is want and so he must be paid for
no no i said i am not go to be the slave of a radic five
hundr bound to do what thei tell me and vote as thei like id rather
stick to my own trade thank you
dont you be in a hurri young man who ask you to be ani on
slave now look hereif somebodi guarante everi farth of expens
to fight the seat and 1200 pound a year and outgo if you should
be success and a bonu of 5000 pound in the event of your be
subsequ defeat or elect to give up parliamentari life will
you take on the job
on those term ye i think so provid i wa sure of the guarantor
and that he wa a man from whom i could take the monei
well you can soon judg of that doctor for it is i samuel strong
and ill deposit 10000 pound in the hand of a truste befor you
write your letter of accept no dont thank me i do it for two
reasonsfirst becaus have no chick or kin of my own i happen to
have taken a fanci to you and wish to push you on the world ha treat
you badli and i want to see you on of it master with all these
smart peopl who look down on you lick your boot as thei will
sure enough if you grow rich and power that my privat reason my
public on is that you ar the onli man in dunchest who can win us the
seat and id think 10000 pound well spent if it put those tori at
the bottom of the poll i want to show them who is boss and that we
wont be lord over by banker and brewer just becaus thei ar rich
men who have bought themselv titl
but you ar a rich man yourself i interrupt
ye doctor and i spend my monei in help those who will help the
peopl now befor you give me ani answer iv got to ask you a thing
or two and he drew a paper from hi pocket ar you prepar to
support the abolit of ti hous

home ruleno i neednt ask you that for it is a dead hors which we
dont want to flog and nowadai we ar all in favour of a big
navi so i think that is about everythingexcept of cours
antivaccin which youll run for all it worth
i never said that i would mr strong i answer
he look at me curious no and you never said you wouldnt
now doctor let us come to an understand about thi for here in
dunchest it worth more than all the other thing put togeth if
thi seat is to be won it will be won on antivaccin that our
burn question and that why you ar be ask to stand becaus
youv studi the thing and ar believ to be on of the few doctor
who dont bow the knee to baal so look here let understand each
other if you have ani doubt about thi matter sai so and we will
have done with it for rememb onc you ar on the platform youv
got to go the whole hog none of your scientif finick but appeal
to the peopl to rise up in their thousand and save their innoc
children from be offer to the moloch of vaccin with enlarg
photograph of nastylook case and the rest of it
i listen and shiver the inquiri into rare case of diseas after
vaccin had been interest work which whatev deduct peopl
might choos to draw in fact commit me to noth but to becom on
of the rag littl regiment of medic dissent to swallow all the
unscientif folli of the antivaccin agit to make myself
respons for and to promulg their distort figur and wild
statementsah that wa anoth thing must i appear upon platform and
denounc thi wonder discoveri as the law of useless infanticid
must i tell peopl that smallpox is realli a cur process and not
the deadli scourg and pestil that doctor pretend it to be must i
maintain that vaccin never did never doe and never can prevent
even a singl case of smallpox must i hold it up as a law of
devil worship and human sacrific to idol
if i accept strong offer it seem that i must do all these
thing more i must be fals to my instinct fals to my train and
profess fals to my scientif knowledg i could not do it and
yetwhen did a man in my posit ever get such a chanc as that which
wa offer to me thi dai i wa readi with my tongu and fond of
public speak from boyhood it had been my desir to enter parliament
where i knew well that i should show to some advantag now without
risk or expens to myself an opportun of gratifi thi ambit
wa given to me inde if i succeed in win thi citi which
had alwai been a tori stronghold for the radic parti i should be a
mark man from the begin and if my career wa not on of assur
prosper the fault would be my own alreadi in imagin i saw
myself rich for in thi wai or in that the monei would come
a favourit of the peopl a trust minist of the crown and
perhapswho could tellennobl live a life of digniti and reput
and at last leav my honour and my fame to those who came after me
on the other hand if i refus thi offer the chanc would pass awai
from me never to return again it wa probabl even that i should lose
stephen strong friendship and support for he wa not a man who like
hi generos to be slight moreov he would believ me unsound upon
hi favourit dogma in short for ever abandon my brilliant hope
i condemn myself to an experi of struggl as a doctor with a
practic among secondclass peopl
after all although the thought of it shock me at first the price i
wa ask to pai wa not so veri heavi mere on of the usual elect
platform formula wherebi the candid bind himself to support all
sort of thing in which he ha littl or no belief alreadi i wa half
commit to thi antivaccin crusad and if i took a step or
two farther in it what did it matter on crank more ad to the great
armi of british enthusiast could make littl differ in the scheme
of thing
if ever a man went through a psycholog moment in thi hour i wa
that man the struggl wa short and sharp but it end as might be
expect in the case of on of my histori and charact could i have
foreseen the dread issu which hung upon my decis i believ that
rather than speak it for the second time in my life i would have sought
the solac to be found in the phial of my medicin chest but i did
not forese them i thought onli of myself of my own hope fear and
ambit forget that no man can live to himself alon and that
hi everi deed must act and react upon other until human ceas to
exist
well said mr strong after a two or three minut paus dure
which these thought were wrestl in my mind
well i answer as you elegantli express it i am prepar to go
the whole hogit is a case of hog versu calf isnt itor for the
matter of that a whole styful of hog
i suppos that my doubt and irrit were appar in the ineleg
jocos of my manner at ani rate stephen strong who wa a shrewd
observ took alarm
look here doctor he said i am honest i am right or wrong i
believ in thi antivaccin busi and we ar go to run the
elect on it if you dont believ in itand you have no particular
call to sinc everi man can claim hi own opinionyoud better let it
alon and look on all thi talk as noth you ar our first and best
man but we have sever upon the list ill go on to on of them and
he took up hi hat
i let him take it i even let him walk toward the door but as he
approach it i reflect that with that dog burli form went all my
ambit and my last chanc of advanc in life when hi hand wa
alreadi on the handl not of premedit but by impuls i said
i dont know why you should talk like that as i think that i have
given good proof that i am no believ in vaccin
what that doctor he ask turn round
my littl girl is nearli four year old and she ha never been
vaccin
is it so he ask doubtfulli
as he spoke i heard the nurs go down the passag and with her my
daughter whom she wa take for her morn walk i open the door
and call jane in a beauti littl be with dark ey and golden
hair
look for yourself i said and take off the child coat i show
him both her arm then i kiss her and sent her back to the nurs
that good enough doctor but mind you she mustnt be vaccin
now
as he spoke the word my heart sank in me for i understood what i
had done and the risk that i wa take but the die wa cast or so i
thought in my folli it wa too late to go back
dont be afraid i said no cow poison shall be mix with her
blood
now i believ you doctor he answer for a man wont plai trick
with hi onli child just to help himself ill take your answer to the
council and thei will send you the formal letter of invit to stand
with the condit attach befor you answer it the monei will be
lodg and you shall have my bond for it and now i must be go
for i am wast your time and those patient of your will be get
tire if you will come to supper tonight ill have some of the leader
to meet you and we can talk thing over goodby we shall win the
seat so sure as my name is stephen strong we shall win on the av
ticket
he went and i saw those of my patient who had sat out the wait when
thei had gone i consid the posit sum it up in my own mind
the prospect wa exhilar and yet i wa depress for i had bound
myself to the chariot wheel of a fals doctrin also by implic
i had told strong a lie it wa true that jane had not been vaccin
but of thi i had neglect to give him the reason it wa that i had
postpon vaccin her for a while ow to a certain infantil
delicaci be better acquaint than most men with the risk
consequ on that oper slight though it is in certain condit
of a child health and know that there wa no danger of her take
smallpox in a town which wa free from it i propos howev to
perform the oper within the next few dai inde for thi veri
purpos i had alreadi written to london to secur some glycerin calf
lymph which would now be wast
the local paper next morn appear with an announc that at the
forthcom byeelect dunchest would be contest in the radic
interest by jame thern esq md thei ad that in addit to
other articl of the radic faith dr thern profess the doctrin
of antivaccin of which he wa so ardent an uphold that
although on sever occas he had been threaten with prosecut
he declin to allow hi onli child to be vaccin
in the same issu it wa announc that the conserv candid
would be sir thoma colford
so the die wa cast i had cross the rubicon
chapter viii
bravo the av
in anoth week the writ had been issu and we were in the thick of
the fight what a fight it wa memori could not record tradit did
not even record anoth half as fierc in the borough of dunchest
for the most part that is in mani of our constitu it is not
difficult for a candid stand in the radic interest if he is
abl wellback and not too particular as to what he promis to win
the seat for hi parti but dunchest wa someth of an except
in a sens it wa corrupt that is it had alwai been repres by
a rich man who wa expect to pai liber for the honour of it
confid pai he did inde in larg and numberless subscript
in the endow of readingroom in present of public park and i
know not what besid
at least it is a fact that almost everi advantag of thi natur enjoi
todai by the inhabit of dunchest ha been provid for them by
former conserv member for the borough
under these circumst it is not to be wonder at that in choos
a candid the major of the elector of the citi were apt to ask two
lead question first is he rich and secondli what will he do for
the town if he get in
now sir thoma colford wa veri rich and it wa whisper that if he
were elect he would be prepar to show hi gratitud in a substanti
fashion a new wing to the hospit wa want thi it wa said would
be erect and endow also forti acr of valuabl land belong to
him ran into the park and he had been heard to sai that these forti
acr were realli much more import to the public than to himself and
that he hope that on dai thei would belong to it
it is small wonder then that the announc of hi candidatur wa
receiv with passion enthusiasm mine on the contrari evok a
choru of disapprov that is in the local press i wa denounc
as an adventur as a man who had stood a crimin trial for wick
neglig and escap the jail onli by the skin of my teeth i wa
held up to public reprob as a socialist who have noth
myself wish to prei upon the good of other and as an
antivaccin quack who to gain a few vote wa readi to infest the
whole commun with a loathsom diseas of all the accus of
my oppon thi wa the onli on that stung me becaus it alon had
truth in it
sir john bell my old enemi on of the nomin of sir thoma
colford appear upon the platform at hi first meet and speak
in the charact of an old and lead citizen of the town and as on
who had doctor most of them implor hi audienc not to trust their
polit fortun to such a person as myself whose doctrin were
repudi by almost everi member of the profess which i disgrac
thi appeal carri much weight with it
from all these circumst it might have been suppos that my case
wa hopeless especi as no radic had even ventur to contest the
seat in the last two elect but in fact thi wa not so for in
dunchest there exist a larg bodi of voter mani of them emploi
in shoemak factori who were almost socialist in their view
these men spend their dai in some hive of machineri and their
night in squalid tenement built in dreari row which in citi
such peopl ar doom to inhabit were veri bitter against the upper
class and inde against all who live in decent comfort
thi wa not to be marvel at for what can be expect of folk
whose lot hard as it is ha none of the mitig that lighten the
troubl of those who live in the countri and who can at least breath
the free air and enjoi the beauti that ar common to all here at
dunchest their pleasur consist for the most part in a dog fight
or some such refin spectacl vari by an occasion boos at
the publichous or in the case of those who chanc to be more
intellectu inclin by attend lectur where social and other
advanc doctrin were preach as wa but natur thi class might
be reli upon almost to a man to vote for the parti which promis to
better their lot rather than for the parti which could onli recommend
them to be content and to improv themselv to secur their support
it wa onli necessari to be extravag of promis and abus of
employ who refus to pai them imposs wage
next in import to these redhot forward came the phalanx of
oldfashion peopl who vote liber becaus their father had
vote liber befor them then there were the elector who us to be
conserv but be honestli dissatisfi with the govern on
account of it foreign polici or for other reason had made up their
mind to transfer their allegi also there were the dissent who
set hatr of the church abov all polit and made it disendow
and humili their watchword in dunchest these were activ and
numer a veri tower of strength to me for stephen strong wa the
wealthiest and most import of them
dure the first dai or two of the canvass howev a care estim
of our elector strength show it to be sever hundr vote short of
that of our oppon therefor if we would win we must make convert
by appeal to the prejudic of member of the elector who were of
conserv view in other word by preach fad
of these there were mani all us to the candid of pliant mind
such as the total drinkprohibit fad the antidogmuzzl fad and
other each of which wa worth some vote even the peculiar peopl a
societi that make a religion of kill helpless children by refus
them medic aid when thei ar ill were good for ten or twelv here
howev i drew the line for when ask whether i would support a bill
reliev them from all liabil to crimin prosecut in the event
of the death of their victim i absolut declin to give ani such
undertak
but although all these fanci had their follow it wa the
antivaccin craze that realli had a hold in dunchest the
av as thei call themselv were number by hundr for the
nation leagu and other similar associ had been at work here for
year with such success that alreadi twenti per cent of the children
born in the last decad had never been vaccin for a while the
board of guardian had been slow to move then on the elect of a new
chairman and the represent of the medic profess of the town
thei institut a seri of prosecut against parent who refus to
compli with the vaccin act unluckili for the conserv parti
these prosecut which arous the most bitter feel were still
go on when the seat fell vacant henc from an elector point of
view the question becam on of firstclass import
in dunchest as elsewher the great major of the antivaccin
were alreadi radic but there remain a residu estim at from
300 to 400 who vote blue or conserv if these men could be
brought over i should win if thei remain faith to their colour i
must lose therefor it will be seen that stephen strong wa right when
he said that the elect would be won or lost upon antivaccin
at the first public meet of the conserv after sir thomass
speech the spokesman of the antivaccin parti rose and ask him
whether he wa in favour of the abolit of the compulsori vaccin
law now at thi veri meet sir john bell had alreadi spoken
denounc me for my view upon thi question therebi to some extent
ty the candid hand so after some paus and consult
sir thoma repli that he wa in favour of free conscienti
objector to vaccin from all legal penalti like most half
measur thi decis of cours did not gain him a singl vote
wherea it certainli lost him much support
on the same even a similar question wa put to me my answer mai
be guess inde i took the opportun to make a speech which wa
cheer to the echo for have act the great lie of espous the
antivaccin caus i felt that it wa not worth while to hesit
in tell other li in support of it moreov i knew my subject
thoroughli and understood what point to dwell upon and what to gloze
over how to twist and turn the statist and how to marshal my fact
in such fashion as would make it veri difficult to expos their fallaci
then when i had done with gener argument i went on to particular
case describ as a doctor can do the most dread which had ever
come under my notic with such power and patho that women in the
audienc burst into tear
final i end by an impass appeal to all present to follow my
exampl and refus to allow their children to be poison i call on
them as free men to rise against thi monstrou tyranni to put a stop
to thi system of organis and judici infanticid and to send me to
parliament to rais my voic on their behalf in the caus of helpless
infant whose tender bodi now dai by dai under the command of the
law were made the receptacl of the most filthi diseas from which
man wa doom to suffer
as i sat down the whole of that great audienceit number more than
2000rose in their place shout we will we will after which
follow a scene of enthusiasm such as i had never seen befor
emphasis by cri of we ar free englishmen down with the
babybutch we will put you in sir and so forth
that meet gave me my cue and thenceforward leav almost everi
other topic on on side i and my worker devot ourselv to preach
the antivaccin doctrin we flood the constitu with tract
head what vaccin doe the law of useless infanticid the
vaccin tyranni is vaccin a fraud and so forth and with
horribl pictur of calv stretch out by pullei gag and
blindfold with their under part cover by vaccin vesicl also
we had photograph of children suffer from the effect of improp or
unclean vaccin which by mean of magic lantern slide could
be thrown lifes on a screen inde on or two such children
themselv were taken round to meet and their sore exhibit
the effect of all thi wa wonder for i know of noth capabl of
rous honest but ignor peopl to greater rage and enthusiasm than
thi antivaccin cry thei believ it to be true or at least
see on or two case in which it is true and have never seen a
case of smallpox thei suppos that the whole race is be poison
by wick doctor for their own gain henc their fierc energi and
heartfelt indign
well it carri me through the elect wa fought not with foil
but with rapier against me were arrai the entir wealth rank and
fashion of the citi reinforc by conserv speaker famou for
their parliamentari eloqu who were sent down to support sir thoma
colford nor wa thi all when it wa recognis that the fight would
be a close on an eloqu and lead member of the hous wa sent to
interven in person he came and address a vast meet gather in
the biggest build of the citi seat among a crowd of workmen on
a back bench i wa on of hi audienc hi speech wa excel if
somewhat too gener and academ to the av agit with
a curiou misapprehens of the state of the case he devot on
paragraph onli it ran someth like thi
i am told that our oppon put asid the great and gener
issu upon which i have had the honour to address you attempt to
gain support by enter upon a crusadeto my mind a most pernici
crusadeagainst the law of compulsori vaccin i am not concern
to defend that law becaus practic in the mind of all reason
men it stand beyond attack it is i am told suggest that the act
should be amend by free from the usual penalti ani parent
who choos to advanc a plea of conscienti object against the
vaccin of hi children such an argument seem to me too pueril
i had almost said too wick to dwell upon for in it issu it would
mean that at the whim of individu innoc children might be expos
to diseas disfigur and death and the whole commun through
them to a veri real and immin danger propheci is danger but
speak for myself as a privat member of parliament i can scarc
believ that respons minist of ani parti move by the pressur
of an illinform and erron opinion would ever consent under thi
elast plea of conscienc to establish such a preced of surrend
vaccin with it prove benefit is outsid the pale of parti after
long and care studi scienc and the medic profess have given
a verdict in it favour a verdict which ha now been confirm by the
experi of gener here i leav the question and turn onc
more befor i sit down to those great and gener issu of which i
have alreadi spoken i would again impress upon thi vast audienc and
through it upon the constitu at larg etc etc etc
within a year it wa my lot to listen to an emin leader of that
distinguish member with the distinguish member tacit consent
press upon an astonish hous of common the need of yield to
the clamour of the antivaccinationist and of insert into the bill
frame upon the report of a royal commiss a claus forbid the
prosecut of parent or guardian will to assert befor a bench of
magistr that thei object to vaccin on conscienti ground
the appeal wa not in vain the bill pass in it amend form and
within twenti year i live to see it fruit
at length came the poll dai after thi laps of time i rememb
littl of it detail i as becam a democrat candid walk
from pollingst to pollingst while my oppon as becam
a wealthi banker drove about the citi in a carriag and four at eight
oclock the ballotbox were seal up and convei to the townhal
where the count commenc in the presenc of the mayor the
candid their agent and the necessari offic and assist
box after box wa open and the paper count out into separ heap
those for colford into on pile those for thern into anoth the
spoil vote be kept by themselv
the count began about halfpast nine and up to a quarter to twelv
nobodi could form an idea as to the ultim result although at that
time the conserv candid appear to be about five and thirti
vote ahead then the last ballotbox wa open it came from a poor
quarter of the citi a ward in which i had mani support
sir thoma colford and i with our littl knot of agent and
subag place ourselv on on each side of the tabl wait in
respect silenc while the clerk dealt out the paper as a player
deal out card it wa an anxiou moment as ani on who ha gone
through a closelycontest parliamentari elect can testifi for ten
dai or more the strain had been great but curious enough now
at it climax it seem to have lost it grip of me i watch the
denoument of the game with keen and interest inde but as though
i were not immedi and person concern i felt that i had done
my best to win and no longer care whether my effort end in success
or failur possibl thi wa the result of the apathi that fall upon
overstrain nerv possibl i wa oppress by the fear of victori
and of that nemesi which almost invari dog the step of our
accomplish desir of what the french writer call la page
effrayant de desir accompli at least just then i care
noth whether i won or lost onli i reflect that in the latter event
it would be sad to have told so mani falsehood to no good purpos
how doe it stand ask the head conserv agent of the offic
the clerk took the last number from the counter and ad up the
figur
colford 4303 thern 4291 and two more bundl to count
anoth packet wa count out
how doe it stand ask the agent
colford 4349 thern 4327 and on more bundl of fifti to count
answer the clerk
the agent gave a sigh of relief and smile i saw him press sir thomass
hand in congratul for now he wa sure that victori wa their
the game is up i whisper to strong who as my princip support
had been admit with me to the hall
he ground hi teeth and i notic in the gaslight that hi face wa
ghastli pale and hi lip were blue
you had better go out i said you ar overtax that dilat heart
of your go home and take a sleep draught
damn you no he answer fierc in my ear those paper come from
the littl martha ward where i thought there wasnt a wrong un in the
crowd if theyv sold me ill be even with them as sure as my name is
strong
come i said with a laugh a good radic shouldnt talk like that
for me the bitter wa over and know the worst i could afford
to laugh
the offici open the last packet and began to count aloud
the first vote wa for thern but bad for the elector had written
hi name upon the paper then in success came nine for colford now
all interest in the result had di awai and a hum of talk aros from
those present in the room a whisper murmur of congratul and
condol no wonder see that to win i must put to my credit
thirtytwo of the forti remain paper which seem a thing
imposs
the counter went on count aloud and deal down the paper as he
count on two three four and straight on up to ten for thern
when he paus to examin a paper then on for colford then in
rapid success five ten fifteen for thern
now the hum of convers di awai for it wa felt that thi wa
becom interest of cours it wa practic imposs that i
should win for there were but fourteen paper left and to do so i must
secur eleven of them
sixteen for thern went on the counter seventeen eighteen
nineteen twenti
now the excit grew intens for if the run held in two more vote i
should tie everi ey wa fix upon the counter hand
to the right and left of him on the tabl were two littl pile of
vote paper the pile to the right wa the properti of colford
the pile to the left wa sacr to thern the paper wa unfold and
glanc at then up went the hand and down float the fate sheet on
to the lefthand pile twentyon for thern again the process wa
repeat and again the lefthand pile wa increas twentytwo for
thern
by heaven youv ti him gasp stephen strong
there were but seven paper left and the candid who secur four of
them would be the winner of the elect
twentythre for thern twentyfour twentyfivea silenc in which
you could hear the breath of other men and the beat of your own
heart
twentysix for thern twentyseven twentyeight twentynin all
for thern
then burst from the lip of stephen strong a shrill hoars cry
more like the cry of a beast than that of a man and the word by god
weve won the av have done it bravo the av
silenc said the mayor bring hi fist down upon the tabl but
so far as stephen strong wa concern the order wa superflu for
suddenli hi face flush then turn a dread ashen grei and down
he sank upon the floor as i leant over him and began to loosen hi
collar i heard the conserv agent sai in strident tone
there is some mistak there must be some mistak it is almost
imposs that dr thern can have poll twentynin vote in
success on behalf of sir thoma colford i demand a recount
certainli answer some offici let it be begun at onc
in that ceremoni i took no part inde i spent the next two hour
with the help of anoth doctor try to restor conscious to
stephen strong in a littl room that open off the townhal within
half an hour mr strong arriv
he still breath i said in answer to her question glanc
then the poor littl woman sat herself down upon the edg of a chair
clasp her hand and said if the lord will it dear stephen will
live and if the lord will it he will die
thi sentenc she repeat at interv until the end came after two
hour there wa a knock at the door
go awai i said but the knocker would not go awai so i open it
wa my agent who whisper in an excit voic the count quit
correct you ar in by seven
all right i answer tell them we want some more brandi
at that moment stephen strong open hi ey and at that moment also
there aros a mighti burst of cheer from the crowd assembl on the
marketplac without to whom the mayor had declar the number from a
window of the townhal
the dy man heard the cheer and look at me inquiringli for he
could not speak i tri to explain that i wa elect on the recount
but wa unabl to make him understand then i hit upon an expedi on
the floor lai a conserv rosett of blue ribbon i took it up and
took also my own radic colour from my coat hold on of them in
each hand befor strong dy ey i lift up the radic orang and
let the conserv blue fall to the floor
he saw and understood for a ghastli smile appear upon hi distort
face inde he did morealmost with hi last breath he spoke in a
hoars gurgl whisper and hi word were bravo the av
now he shut hi ey and i thought that the end had come but open
them present he fix them with great earnest first upon myself
and then upon hi wife accompani the glanc with a slight movement
of the head i did not know what he could mean but with hi wife it
wa otherwis for she said dont troubl yourself stephen i quit

mr strong in her quiet voic when you have spoken to the peopl out
there doctor will you take me home i am veri sorri to troubl but i
saw that after he wa gone stephen wish me to turn to you
chapter ix
fortun
my return to parliament meant not onli the loss of a seat to the
govern a matter of no great moment in view of their enorm
major but probabl through their own fear wa constru by
them into a solemn warn not to be disregard certain paper and
opposit speaker talk freeli of the write on the wall and none
saw that write in larger or more fieri letter than the member of
her majesti govern i believ that to them it took the form not of
hebraic charact but of two larg roman capit the letter a and
v
hitherto the antivaccin had been known as troublesom peopl who
had to be reckon with but that thei should prove strong enough to
wrest what had been consid on of the safest seat in the kingdom
out of the hand of the unionist came upon the parti as a revel of
the most unpleas order for stephen strong dy cry of which the
truth wa univers acknowledg the av have done it bravo the
av had echo through the length and breadth of the land
when a govern think that agit ar weak natur and properli
it treat them with contempt but when it find that thei ar strong
enough to win elect then their argument becom more worthi of
consider and so the great heart of the parliamentari pharaoh began
to soften toward the antivaccin and of thi soften the first
sign were discern within three or four dai of my take my seat as
member for dunchest
i think i mai sai without vaniti and the statement will not be
contradict by those who sat with me that i made a good impress
upon the hous from the first dai i enter it door doubtless it
member had expect to find in me a rabid person liabl to burst into a
foam of violenc at the word vaccin and were agreeabl surpris
to find that i wa much as other men ar onli rather quieter than most
of them i did not attempt to forc myself upon the notic of the hous
but onc or twice dure the dinner hour i made a few remark upon
subject connect with public health which were receiv without
impati and in the interv i tri to master it form and to
get in touch with it temper
in those farawai and longforgotten dai a royal commiss had been
sit for some year to consid the whole question of compulsori
vaccin it wa the same befor which i had been call to give
evid at length thi commiss deliv itself of it final
report a veri sensibl on in an enorm bluebook which if adopt
would practic have continu the exist vaccin act with
amend these amend provid that in futur the public
vaccin should visit the home of the child and if the condit
of that home and of the child itself were healthi offer to vaccin it
with glycerin calf lymph also thei extend the time dure which
the parent and guardian were exempt from prosecut and in variou
wai mitig the rigour of the prevail regul the subject
matter of thi report wa embodi in a short bill to amend the law and
laid befor parliament which bill went to a stand committe and
ultim came up for the consider of the hous
then follow the great debat and the great surpris a member move
that it should be read that dai six month and other follow on the
same side the presid of the local govern board of the dai i
rememb made a strong speech in favour of the bill after which other
member spoke includ myself but although about nineti out of everi
hundr of the individu who then constitut the hous of common
were strong believ in the merit of vaccin hardli on of them
rose in hi place to support the bill the lesson of dunchest amongst
other wa befor their ey and whatev their privat faith might
be thei were convinc that if thei did so it would lose them vote at
the next elect
at thi omin silenc the govern grew frighten and toward the
end of the debat to the astonish of the hous and of the countri
the first lord of the treasuri rose and offer to insert a claus by
virtu of which ani parent or other person who under the bill would
be liabl to penalti for the nonvaccin of a child should be
entir freed from such penalti if within four month of it birth
he satisfi two justic of the peac that he conscienti believ
that the oper would be prejudici to that child health the bill
pass with the claus which a few dai later wa reject by the
hous of lord govern pressur wa put upon the lord who thereon
revers their decis and the bill becam an act of parliament
thu the whole polici of compulsori vaccin which for mani year
had been in forc in england wa destroi at a singl blow by a
govern with a great major and a hous of common compos of
member who for the most part were absolut believ in it virtu
never befor did agit meet with so vast and complet a success and
seldom perhap did a govern undertak so great a respons for
the sake of peac and in order to shelv a troublesom and danger
disput it wa a veri triumph of opportun for the govern aid
and abet by their support threw over their belief to appeas a
small but persist section of the elector convinc that compulsori
vaccin wa for the benefit of the commun thei yet stretch
the theori of the author of the parent over the child to such
an unpreced extent that in order to satisfi hi individu
prejudic that parent wa henceforth to be allow to expos hi
helpless infant to the risk of terribl diseas and of death
it is not for me to judg their motiv which mai have been pure and
excel my own ar enough for me to deal with but the fact remain
that have power in their hand to impos the conclus of a
committe of expert on the nation and be as a bodi satisfi as
to the sound of those conclus thei still took the risk of
disregard them now the result of their action is evid now we
have reap the seed which thei sow nor did thei win a vote or a
thank you by their amiabl and philosoph concess which earn
them no gratitud but indign mingl with someth not unlik
contempt
so much for the antivaccin agit on the crest of whose wave i
wa carri to fortun and success thenceforward for mani long year my
career wa on of strang and startl prosper dunchest becam
my pocket borough so much so inde that at the three elect which
occur befor the last of which i have to tell no on even ventur to
contest the seat against me although i wa never recognis as a leader
of men chiefli i believ becaus of a secret distrust which wa
entertain as to my charact and the sincer of my motiv session
by session my parliamentari reput increas till in the last radic
govern i wa offer and for two year fill the post of
undersecretari to the home offic inde when at last we went to
the countri over the question of the china war i had in my pocket a
discreetli word undertak that if our parti succeed at the poll
my claim to the home secretaryship should be carefulli consid
but it wa not fate that i should ever again cross the threshold of st
stephen
so much for my public career which i have onli touch on in
illustr of my privat and moral histori
the reader mai wonder how it came about that i wa abl to support
myself and keep up my posit dure all thi space of time see
that my attend in parliament made it imposs for me to continu
in practis as a doctor it happen thu
when my old and true friend stephen strong di on the night of my
elect it wa found that he wa even richer than had been suppos
inde hi personalti wa sworn at 191000 pound besid which he
left real estat in shop hous and land to the valu of about 23000
pound almost all of thi wa devis to hi widow absolut so that
she could dispos of it in whatev fashion pleas her inde there
wa but on other bequest that of the balanc of the 10000 pound
which the testat had deposit in the hand of a truste for my
benefit thi wa now left to me absolut i learn the fact from
mr strong herself as we return from the funer
dear stephen ha left you nearli 9000 pound doctor she said shake
her head
gather from her manner and thi shake of her head that the legaci
wa not pleas to her i hasten to explain that doubtless it wa
to carri into effect a busi arrang we had come to befor i
consent to stand for parliament
ah inde she said that make it wors for it is onli the payment
of a debt not a gift
not know what she could mean i said noth
doubtless doctor if dear stephen had been grant time he would have
treat you more liber see how much he thought of you and that
you had given up your profess entir to pleas him and serv the
parti that is what he meant when he look at me befor he di i
guess it from the first and now i am sure of it well doctor while
i have anyth you shall never want of cours a member of parliament
is a great person expect to live in a style which would take more
monei than i have but i think that if i put my own expens at 500
pound a year which is as much as i shall want and allow anoth 1000
pound for subscript to the antivaccin societi the societi
for prevent the muzzl of dog and the societi for the discoveri
of the lost tribe of israel i shall be abl to help you to the extent
of 1200 pound a year if she ad apologet you think you
could possibl get along on that
but mr strong i said i have no claim at all upon you
pleas do not talk nonsens doctor dear stephen wish me to provid
for you and i am onli carri out hi wish with hi own monei which
god gave him perhap for thi veri purpos that it should be us to
help a clever man to break down the tyranni of wick govern and
fals prophet
so i took the monei which wa paid with the utmost regular on
januari the first and june the first in each year on thi incom i
live in comfort keep up my hous in dunchest for the benefit of
my littl daughter and her attend and hire for my own us a flat
quit close to the hous of common
as the year went by howev a great anxieti took possess of me
for by slow degre mr strong grew as feebl in mind as alreadi
she wa in bodi till at length she could onli recognis peopl at
interv and becam quit incompet to transact busi for a
while her banker went on pai the allow under her written and
unrevok order but when thei understood her true condit thei
refus to continu the payment
now my posit wa veri seriou i had littl or noth put by and
have ceas to practis for about seventeen year i could not hope
to earn an incom from my profess nor could i remain a member of
the hous at least not for long still by dint of borrow and the
mortgag of some properti which i had acquir i kept my head abov
water for about eighteen month veri soon howev my financi
distress becam known with the result that i wa no longer so
cordial receiv as i had been either in dunchest or in london the
impecuni cannot expect to remain popular
at last thing came to a climax and i wa driven to the step of
resign my seat i wa in london at the time and thenc i wrote the
letter to the chairman of the radic committe in dunchest give
illhealth as the caus of my retir when at length it wa finish
to my satisfact i went out and post it and then walk along
the embank as far as cleopatra needl and back again it wa
a melancholi walk taken i rememb upon a melancholi novemb
afternoon on which the dank mist from the river strove for masteri with
the gloomi shadow of advanc night not sinc that other even
mani mani year ago when after my trial i found myself face to face
with ruin or death and wa save by stephen strong had my fortun been
at so low an ebb now inde thei appear absolut hopeless for i
wa no longer young and fit to begin the world afresh also the
other parti be in power i could not hope to obtain ani salari
appoint upon which to support myself and my daughter if mr strong
had kept her reason all would have been well but she wa insan and i
had no on to whom i could turn for i wa a man of mani acquaint
but few friend
wearili i trudg back to my room to wait there until it wa time to
dress for i had a dinner engag at the reform club on the tabl in
the littl hall lai a telegram which i open listlessli it wa from a
wellknown firm of solicitor in dunchest and ran
our client mr strong di suddenli at three oclock import that
we should see you will you be in dunchest tomorrow if not pleas
sai where and at what hour we can wait upon you in town
wait upon you in town i said to myself as i laid down the telegram a
great firm of solicitor would not wish to wait upon me unless thei had
someth to tell me to my advantag and their own mr strong must
have left me some monei possibl even i wa her heir more than onc
befor in life my luck had turn in thi sudden wai why should it not
happen again but she wa insan and could not appoint an heir why had
not those fool of lawyer told me the fact instead of leav me to
the torment of thi suspens
i glanc at the clock then take a telegraph form i wrote shall be
at dunchest station 830 meet me there or later at the club take
a cab i drove to st pancra just in time to catch the train in my
pocketso close wa i press for monei for my account at the bank
wa actual overdrawni had bare enough to pai for a thirdclass
ticket to dunchest thi matter littl howev for i alwai
travel thirdclass not becaus i like it but becaus it look
democrat and the right sort of thing for a radic mp to do
the train wa a fast on but that journei seem absolut endless
now at length we had slow down at the dunchest signalbox and now
we were run into the town if my friend the lawyer had anyth
realli strike to tell me he would send to meet me at the station and
if it wa someth remark he would probabl attend there himself
therefor if i saw neither the manag clerk nor the junior partner
nor the head of the firm i might be certain that the new wa trivial
probablydread thought which had not occur to me beforethat
i wa appoint executor under the will with a legaci of a hundr
guinea
the train roll into the station as it began to glide past the
pavement of wet asphalt i close my ey to postpon the bitter of
disappoint if onli for a few second perforc i open them again
as the train wa stop and there the veri first thing thei fell
upon look portli and impos in a fur coat wa the rubicundfac
head of the firm himself it is good i thought and support
myself for a moment by the hatrack for the revuls of feel
produc a sudden faint he saw me and sprang forward with a
beam yet respect counten it is veri good i thought
my dear sir he began obsequi i do trust that my telegram ha
not incommod you but my new wa such that i felt it necessari to
meet you at the earliest possibl moment and therefor wire to you at
everi probabl address
i gave the porter who took my bag a shill practic it wa
my last but that lawyer face and manner seem to justifi the
expenditur whichso oddli ar our mind constitutedi rememb
reflect i might regret if i had drawn a fals infer the man
touch hi hat profus and i hope made up hi mind to vote for me
next time then i turn to the head of the firm and said
prai dont apologis but by the wai beyond that of the death of my
poor friend what is the new
oh perhap you know it he answer taken aback at my manner
though she alwai insist upon it be kept a dead secret so that
on dai you might have a pleasant surpris
i know noth i answer
then i am glad to be the bearer of such good intellig to a
fortun and distinguish man he said with a bow i have the honour
to inform you in my capac of executor to the will of the late mr
martha strong that with the except of a few legaci you ar left
her sole heir
now i wish that the hatrack wa still at hand but as it wa not i
pretend to stumbl and leant for a moment against the porter who had
receiv my last shill
inde i said recov myself and can you tell me the amount of
the properti
not exactli he answer but she ha led a veri save life and
monei grow you know monei grow i should sai it must be between
three and four hundr thousand nearer the latter than the former
perhap
realli i repli that is more than i expect it is a littl
astonish to be lift in a moment from the posit of on with a
mere compet into that of a rich man but our poor friend waswel
weakmind so how could she be compet to make a bind will
my dear sir her will wa made within a month of her husband death
when she wa as sane as you ar as i have plenti of letter to show
onli as i have said she kept the content a dead secret in order that
on dai thei might be a pleasant surpris to you
well i answer all thing consid thei have been a pleasant
surpris i mai sai a veri pleasant surpris and now let us go and
have some dinner at the club i feel tire and thirsti
next morn the letter that i had post from london to the chairman of
my committe wa at my request return to me unopen
chapter x
jane meet dr merchison
nobodi disput my inherit for so far as i could learn mr
strong had no rel nor inde could it have been disput for i
had never so much as hypnotis the deceas when it wa known how
rich i had becom i grew even more popular in dunchest than i had been
befor also my import increas at headquart to such an extent
that on a chang of govern i becam as i have said undersecretari
to the home offic although i wa a us man hitherto i had alwai
been refus ani sort of offic becaus of the extrem view which i
professedon platform in the constituenciesor so those in
author alleg now howev these view were put down to
amiabl eccentr moreov i wa care not to obtrud them
respons sober and as we ag and succe we becom more
moder for most of us have a method in our mad
in brief i determin to give up polit knighterrantri and to stick
to sober busi veri carefulli and in the most conserv spirit i
took stock of the situat i wa still a coupl of year on the right
side of fifti young look for my ag an advantag a desir
parti a great advantag although i had no intent of remarri
and in full health and vigour further i possess a larg fortun all
in cash or in liquid asset and i resolv that it should not diminish
i had experienc enough of up and down i wa sick of vicissitud
of fear and uncertainti for the futur i said to my soul thou hast
enough laid up for mani dai eat drink and be merri and i proceed
to invest my modest compet in such a fashion that it brought in a
steadi four per cent no south african mine or other soulagonis
specul for me sweet secur wa what i crave and i got it i
could live with great comfort even with modest splendour upon about
half my incom and the rest of it i purpos to lai out for my futur
benefit i had observ that brewer merchant and other magnat with
cash to spare ar in due cours elev to the peerag now i wish to
be elev to the peerag and to spend an honour and honour
old ag as lord dunchest so when there wa ani shortag of the parti
fund and such a shortag soon occur on the occas of an elect
i pose as the friend round the corner
moreov i had anoth aim my daughter jane had now grown into a
love captiv and highspirit young woman to my fanci inde
i never saw her equal in appear for the larg dark ey shine in
a fair and spirituel face encircl by mass of rippl chestnut
hair gave a bizarr and unusu distinct to her beauti which
wa enhanc by a tall and grace figur she wa witti also and
selfwil qualiti which she inherit from her american mother
moreov she ador me and believ in me i who sinc my wife death
had love noth els love thi pure and noblemind girl as onli
a father can love for my ador had noth selfish in it wherea
that of the truest lover although he mai not know it is in it
begin alwai selfish he ha someth to gain he seek hi own
happi the father seek onli the happi of hi child
on the whole i think that the worship of thi daughter of mine is
a redeem point in my charact for which otherwis sit in
judgment on it as i do todai i have no respect jane understood that
worship and wa grate to me for it her fine unsulli instinct
taught her that whatev els about me might be unsound or tarnish
thi at least rang true and wa beyond suspicion she mai have seen my
open fault and divin my secret weak but for the sake of
the love i bore her she overlook them all inde she refus to
acknowledg them to the extent that my worst polit extravag
becam to her articl of faith what i upheld wa right what i
denounc wa wrong on other point her mind wa open and intellig
but on these it wa a shut and bolt door my father sai so wa her
last argument
my posit be such that i could ensur her a splendid futur i wa
natur anxiou that she should make a brilliant marriag sinc with
monstrou injustic destini ha decre that a woman road to
success must run past the altar but as yet i could find no man whom
i consid suitabl or worthi on or two i knew but thei were not
peer and i wish her to marri a peer or a rise politician who would
earn or inherit a peerag
and so good easi man i look around me and said that full sure
my great wa aripen who think of winter and it frost in the
glow of such a summer as i enjoi
for a while everyth went well i took a hous in green street and
entertain there dure the sit of parliament the beauti of the
hostess my daughter jane togeth with my own posit and wealth of
which she wa the heiress were suffici to find us friend or at ani
rate associ among the noblest and most distinguish in the land
and for sever season my dinner parti were some of the most talk
about in london to be ask to on of them wa consid a compliment
even by men who ar ask almost everywher
with such advantag of person intellig and surround at her
command jane did not lack for opportun of settl herself in
life to my knowledg she had three offer in on season the last of
them from perhap the best and most satisfactori parti in england but
to my great and everincreas dismai on after anoth she refus
them all the first two disappoint i bore but on the third
occas i remonstr she listen quit quietli then said
i am veri sorri to vex you father dear but to marri a man whom i do
not care about is just the on thing i cant do even for your sake
but sure jane i urg a father should have some voic in such a
matter
i think he ha a right to sai whom hi daughter shall not marri
perhap but not whom she shall marri
then at least i said catch at thi straw will you promis that
you wont becom engag to ani on without my consent
jane hesit a littl and then answer what is the us of talk
of such a thing father as i have never seen anybodi to whom i wish to
becom engag but if you like i will promis you that if i should
chanc to see ani on and you dont approv of him i will not becom
engag to him for three year by the end of which time he would
probabl ceas to wish to becom engag to me but she ad with a
laugh i am almost certain he wouldnt be a duke or a lord or anyth
of that sort for provid a man is a gentleman i dont care twopenc
about hi have a titl
jane dont talk so foolishli i answer
well father she said astonish if those ar my opinion at
least i got them from you for i wa alwai brought up upon strictli
democrat principl how often have i heard you declar in your
lectur down at dunchest that men of our race ar all equalexcept
the workingman who is better than the othersand that but for social
prejudic the son of toil is worthi of the hand of ani titl ladi in
the kingdom
i havent deliv that lectur for year i answer angrili
no father not sincelet me see not sinc old mr strong left you
all her monei and you were made an undersecretari of state and lord
and ladi began to call on us now i shouldnt have said that becaus
it make you angri but it is true though isnt it and she wa gone
that august when the hous rose we went down to a place that i own on
the outskirt of dunchest it wa a charm old hous situat in
the midst of a consider estat that is famou for it shoot thi
properti had come to me as part of mr strong bequest or rather
she held a heavi mortgag on it and when it wa put up for sale i
bought it in as jane had taken a fanci to the hous which wa larg
and roomi with beauti garden i let my old home in the citi and
when we were not in town we came to live at ashfield
on the border of the ashfield estateinde part of the land upon
which it wa built belong to itli a poor suburb of dunchest
occupi by workmen and their famili in these peopl jane took great
interest inde she plagu me till at veri larg expens i built a
number of model cottag for them with electr ga and water
laid on and bicyclehous attach in fact thi prove a futil
proceed for the onli result wa that the former occup of the
dwell were squeez out while person of a better class such as
clerk took possess of the model tenement at a total inadequ
rent
it wa in visit some of the tenant of these cottag that in an evil
hour jane first met dr merchison a young man of about thirti who held
some parish appoint which place the sick of thi district under
hi charg ernest merchison wa a rawbon muscular and rather
formidablelook person of scotch descent with stronglymark
featur deepset ey and veri long arm a man of few word when he
did speak hi languag wa direct to the verg of brusqu but hi
record as a medic man wa good and even distinguish and alreadi he
had won the reput of be the best surgeon in dunchest thi
wa the individu who wa select by my daughter jane to receiv
the affect which she had refus to some of the most polish and
admir men in england and as i believ larg for the reason that
instead of bow and sigh about after her he treat her with a
rude which wa almost brutal
in on of these new model hous live some peopl of the name of smith
mr smith wa a compositor and mr smith nee samuel wa none
other than that veri littl girl whom togeth with her brother who
di i had onc treat for erysipela result from vaccin in
a wai i felt grate to her for that case wa the begin of my real
success in life and for thi reason out of sever applic the
new model hous wa let to her husband as soon as it wa readi for
occup
could i have foreseen the result which were to flow from an act of
kind and that as thi famili had indirectli been the caus of my
triumph so thei were in turn to be the caus of my ruin i would have
destroi the whole street with dynamit befor i allow them to set
foot in it howev thei came bring with them two children a
littl girl of four to whom jane took a great fanci and a babi of
eighteen month
in due cours these children caught the whoopingcough and jane visit
them take with her some delicaci as a present while she wa there
dr merchison arriv in hi capac of parish doctor and beyond a
curt bow take no notic of jane began hi examin for thi wa
hi first visit to the famili present hi ey fell upon a box of
sweet
what that he ask sharpli
it a present that miss thern here ha brought for totti answer
the mother
then totti mustnt eat them till she is well sugar is bad for
whoopingcough though of cours a young ladi couldnt be expect to
know that he ad in a voic of gruff apolog then went on quickli
glanc at the littl girl arm no mark i see conscienti
objector or onli lazi
then mr smith fire up and pour out her own sad histori and that of
her poor littl brother who di bare her scar arm in proof of it
and so she finish though i do not rememb much about it myself
i do rememb my mother dy word which were to mind what the
doctor had told her and never to have ani child of mine vaccin no
not if thei crawl on their knee to ask it of me
the doctor said merchison with scorn you mean the idiot my good
woman or more like the polit agit who would sell hi soul for
a billet
then jane rose in wrath
i beg your pardon for interrupt you sir she said but the
gentleman you speak of as an idiot or a polit agit is dr
thern my father the member of parliament for thi citi
dr merchison stare at her for a long while and inde when she wa
angri jane wa beauti enough to make ani on stare then he said
simpli oh inde i dont meddl with polit so i didnt know
thi wa too much for jane who afraid to trust herself to further
speech walk straight out of the cottag she had pass down the
model garden and arriv at the model gate when she heard a quick
power step behind her and turn round to find herself face to face
with dr merchison
i have follow you to apologis miss thern he said of cours i
had no idea who you were and did not wish to hurt your feel but i
happen to have strong feel about vaccin and spoke more roughli
than i ought to have done
other peopl sir mai also have strong opinion about vaccin
answer jane
i know he said and i know too what the end of it all will be
as you will also miss thern if you live long enough it is useless
argu the list ar close and we must wait until the thing is put to
the proof of battl when it is on thing is sure there will be
plenti of dead he ad with a grim smile then take off hi hat and
mutter again i apologis he return into the cottag
it seem that for a while jane wa veri angri then she rememb
that after all dr merchison had apologis and that he had made hi
offens remark in the ignor and prejudic which afflict the
entir medic profess and were more worthi of piti than of anger
further she rememb that in her indign she had forgotten to
acknowledg or accept hi apolog and lastli she ask him to a
gardenparti
it is scarc necessari for me to dwell upon the subsequ
develop of thi unhappi businessif i am right in call it
unhappi the piteou littl drama is plai both the actor ar dead
and the issu of the piec is unknown and for the present unknow
bitterli oppos as i wa to the suit of merchison justic compel me
to sai that under the cloak of a rough unpromis manner he hid a
just and gener heart had that man live he might have becom great
although he would never have becom popular as least someth in hi
natur attract my daughter jane for she who up to that time had not
been move by ani man becam deepli attach to him
in the end he propos to her how when or where i cannot sai for i
never inquir on morn i rememb it wa that of christma dai
thei came into my librari the pair of them and inform me how matter
stood merchison went straight to the point and put the case befor
me veri briefli but in a manli and outspoken fashion he said that
he quit understood the difficulti of hi posit inasmuch as he
believ that jane wa or would be veri rich wherea he had noth
beyond hi profess in which howev he wa do well he end by
ask my consent to the engag subject to ani reason condit
that i might choos to lai down
to me the shock wa great for occupi as i wa with my own affair
and ambit i had been blind to what wa pass befor my face
i had hope to see my daughter a peeress and now i found her the
affianc bride of a parish sawbon the veri foundat of my hous of
hope wa sap at a blow all my scheme for the swift aggrandis
of my famili were laid low it wa too much for me instead of accept
the inevit and be glad to accept it becaus my child happi
wa involv i rebel and kick against the prick
by natur i am not a violent man but on that occas i lost my
temper and becam violent i refus my consent i threaten to cut
my daughter off with noth but at thi argument she and her lover
smile then i took anoth ground for rememb her promis that
she would consent to be separ for three year from ani suitor of
whom i did not approv i claim it fulfil
somewhat to my surpris after a hurri privat consult jane and
her lover accept these condit tell me frankli that thei
would wait for three year but that after these had gone by thei would
consid themselv at liberti to marri with my consent if possibl
but if necessari without it then in my presenc thei kiss and
part nor until the last did either of them attempt to break the
letter of their bond onc inde thei met befor that dread hour
but then it wa the work of fate that brought them togeth and not
their own design
chapter xi
the come of the redhead man
half of the three year of probat had gone by and onc more we found
ourselv at dunchest in august under circumst still too recent
to need explan the govern of which i wa a member had decid
to appeal to the countri the gener elect be fix for the
end of septemb after the termin of harvest dunchest wa
consid to be a safe radic seat and as a matter of parliamentari
tactic the poll for thi citi togeth with that of eight or ten
other borough wa fix for the earliest possibl dai in the hope
that the result might encourag more doubt place to give their
support constitu ar veri like sheep and if the leader jump
through a certain gap in the polit hedg the flock or a larg
proport of it will gener follow all of us like to be on the
win side
few peopl who ar old enough to rememb it will ever forget the august
of two year ago if onli becaus of the phenomen heat up to that
month the year had been veri cold so cold that even dure juli there
were some even when a fire wa welcom while on sever dai i saw
peopl drive about the road wrap up in heavi ulster but with the
first dai of august all thi chang and suddenli the climat becam
torrid the night especi be extraordinarili hot from everi
quarter of the countri came complaint of the great heat while each
issu of the newspap contain list of those who had fallen victim
to it
on even feel oppress in the treeenclos park of ashfield
i stroll out of it into the suburb of which i have spoken almost
opposit the privat garden of the park stand a board school and in
front of thi board school i had laid out an acr of land present by
myself as a playground and open space for the us of the public in the
centr of thi garden wa a fountain that fell into a marbl basin and
around the fountain but at some distanc from it stood iron seat
to these i made my wai and sat down on on of them which wa empti
in order to enjoi the cool sound of the splash water about which a
larg number of children were plai
present as i sat thu i lift my ey and saw the figur of a man
approach toward the other side of the fountain he wa quit fifti
yard awai from me so that hi featur were invis but there wa
someth about hi gener aspect which attract my attent at onc
to begin with he look small and lone all by himself out there on
the wide expans of gravel moreov the last rai of the set
sun strike full upon him gave him a fieri and unnatur appear
against the dens background of shadow beyond it is a strang and
dread coincid but by some extraordinari action of the mind so
subtl that i cannot trace the link the apparit of thi man out of
the gloom into the fierc light of the sunset remind me of a pictur
that i had onc seen repres the approach to the norwegian harbour
of the ship which brought the plagu to the shore of scandanavia in
the pictur that ship also wa cloth with the fire of sunset while
behind it lai the black of approach night like thi wander
that ship also came forward slowli inde but without paus as though
aliv with a purpos of it own and i rememb that await it upon
the quai were a number of merri children
shake myself free from thi ridicul but unpleas thought i
continu to observ the man idli clearli he wa on of the great armi
of tramp for hi coat wa wide and rag and hi hat half innoc of
rim although there wa someth about hi figur which suggest to
me that he had seen better dai i could even imagin that under certain
circumst i might have come to look veri much like thi poor man
now doubtless turn into a mere anim by drink he drew on with a long
slow step hi head stretch forward hi ey fix upon the water
as he walk now and again lift a long thin hand and scrape
impati at hi face and head
that poor fellow ha got a touch of prickli heat and is thirsti
i thought nor wa i mistaken for on arriv at the edg of the
fountain the tramp knelt down and drank copious make a moan
sound as he gulp the water which wa veri peculiar and unpleas to
hear when he had satisfi hi thirst he sat himself upon the marbl
edg of the basin and suddenli plung hi leg boot and all into the
water it touch seem to pleas him for with a singl swift movement
he slip in altogeth sit himself down on the bottom of the
basin in such fashion that onli hi face and fieri red beard from which
the hat had fallen remain abov the surfac whereon thei seem to
float like some monstrou and unnatur growth
thi unusu proceed on the part of the tramp stranger at onc
excit the most intens interest in the mind of everi child on the
playground with the result that in anoth minut forti or fifti
of them had gather round the fountain laugh and jeer at it
occup again the sight brought to my mind a strain and disagre
simil for i bethought me of the dread tale of elisha and of the
fate which overtook the children who mock him decidedli the heat had
upset my nerv that night nor were thei sooth when suddenli from the
red head float upon the water came a flutelik and educ voic
sai
ceas derid the unfortun children or i will come out of thi
marbl bath and tickl you
thereat thei laugh all the more and began to pelt the bather with
littl stone and bit of stick
at first i thought of interf but as it occur to me that the man
would probabl be violent or abus if i spoke to him and as abov
all thing i dislik scene i made up my mind to fetch a policeman
whom i knew i should find round the corner about a hundr yard awai i
walk to the corner but did not find the policeman whereon i start
across the squar to look for him at anoth point my road led me
past the fountain and as i approach it i saw that the waterlov
wander had been as good as hi word he had emerg from the fountain
and rush to and fro rain moistur from hi wide coat despit
their shriek half of fear and half of laughter he grab child after
child and draw it to him tickl and kiss it laugh dementedli
all the while in a fashion which show me that he wa suffer from
some form of mania
as soon as he saw me the man drop the last child he had caughtit
wa littl totti smithand began to stride awai toward the citi
at the same slow regular purpos gait with which i had seen him
approach the fountain as he pass he turn and made a grimac at
me and then i saw hi dread face no wonder it had look red at
a distanc for the erythema almost cover it except where on the
forehead and cheek appear purpl spot and patch
of what did it remind me
great heaven i rememb it remind me of the face of that girl i
had seen ly in the plaza of san jose in mexico over whom the old
woman wa pour water from the fountain much such a fountain as
that befor me for half unconsci when plan thi place i had
reproduc it beauti design it all came back to me with a shock
the horribl scene of which i had scarc thought for year so vividli
inde that i seem to hear the old hag voic cry in crack
accent si senor viruela viruela
i ought to have sent to warn the polic and the health offic of the
citi for i wa sure that the man wa suffer from what is commonli
call confluent smallpox but i did not from the begin there ha
been someth about thi terribl diseas which physic and moral
ha exercis so great an influenc over my destini that seem to
paralys my mental power in my dai i wa a doctor fearless of ani
other contagion typhu scarletina diphtheria yellow fever none
of them had terror for me and yet i wa afraid to attend a case of
smallpox from the same caus in my public speech i made light of it
talk of it with contempt as a sick of small account much as a
housemaid talk in the servant hall of the ghost which is suppos to
haunt the back stair
and now come as it were from that merri and popul chamber of
life and health onc again i met the spectr i derid a redhead
redvisag thing that chose me out to stop and grin at somehow i wa
not mind to return and announc the fact
why thei would sai you were the on who did not believ in
ghost it wa you who preach of vile superstit and yet mere
at the sight of a shadow you rush in with trembl hand and bristl
hair to bid us lai it with bell book and candl where is your faith
o prophet
it wa nonsens the heat and all my incess polit work had tri
me and i wa mistaken that tramp wa a drunken or perhap a crazi
creatur afflict with some skin diseas such as ar common among hi
class why did i allow the incid to troubl me
i went home and wash out my mouth and sprinkl my cloth with a
strong solut of permangan of potash for although my own folli
wa evid it is alwai as well to be care especi in hot
weather still i could not help wonder what might happen if by
ani chanc smallpox were to get a hold of a popul like that of
dunchest or inde of a hundr other place in england
sinc the pass of the famou conscienc claus mani year befor as
wa anticip would be the case and as the antivaccin intend
should be the case vaccin had becom a dead letter amongst at
least seventyf per cent of the peopl our variou societi
and agent were not content to let thing take their cours and to allow
parent to vaccin their children or to leav them unvaccin
as thei might think fit on the contrari we had institut a
housetohous canvass and our visitor took with them form of
conscienti object to be fill in by parent or guardian and
legal wit
sinc the abov wa written the author ha read in the
press that in yorkshir a singl bench of magistr out of
the hundr in england ha alreadi grant order on the
ground of conscienti object under which some 2000
children ar exempt from the scope of the vaccin
act so far as he ha seen thi statement ha not been
contradict at ipswich also about 700 applic
affect mani children have been file to deal with these
the bench is hold special session sit at seven
oclock in the even
at first the magistr refus to accept these form but after
a while when thei found how imposs it wa to dive into a man
conscienc and to decid what wa or what wa not conscienti
object thei receiv them as suffici evid provid onli
that thei were sworn befor some on entitl to administ oath mani
of the objector did not even take the troubl to do as much as thi
for within five year of the pass of the act in practic the
vaccin law ceas to exist the burden of prosecut rest with
board of guardian popularli elect bodi and what board wa like
to go to the troubl of work up a case and to the expens of bring
it befor the court when to produc a complet defenc the defend
need onli declar that he had a conscienti object to the law under
which the inform wa laid against him mani idl or obstin or
prejud peopl would develop conscienti object to anyth
which give troubl or that thei happen to dislik for instanc if the
same principl were appli to educ i believ that within a veri
few year not twentyf per cent of the children belong to the
class that ar educ out of the rate would ever pass the school
board standard
thu it came about that the harvest wa ripe and over ripe await
onli the appoint sickl of diseas onc or twice alreadi that sickl
had been put in but alwai befor the reap began it wa stai by
the applic of the terribl rule of isol known as the improv
leicest system
among some of the nativ of africa when smallpox break out in a kraal
that kraal is surround by guard and it inhabit ar left to
recov or perish to starv or to feed themselv as chanc and
circumst mai dictat dure the absenc of the smallpox law the
same plan more mercifulli appli prevail in england and thu
the evil hour wa postpon but it wa onli postpon for like a
cumul tax it wa heap up against the countri and at last the
hour had come for payment to an author whose book must be balanc
without remitt or reduct what is due to natur that natur take
in her own wai and season neither less nor more unless inde the
skill and provid of man can find mean to forc her to write off the
debt
five dai after my encount with the redhead vagrant the follow
paragraph appear in on of the local paper pocklingham in the
casual ward of the union hous for thi district a tramp name unknown
di last night he had been admit on the previou even but for
some unexplain reason it wa not notic until the next morn that
he suffer from ill and therefor he wa allow to mix with
the other inmat in the gener ward dr butt and clarkson who were
call in to attend state that the caus of death wa the worst form of
smallpox the bodi will be buri in quicklim but some alarm is felt
in the district ow to the deceas who it is said arriv here
from dunchest where he had been frequent variou tramp lodg
have mix with a number of other vagrant who left the hous befor
the charact of hi sick wa discov and who cannot now be
trace the unfortun man wa about forti year of ag of medium
height and redhair
the same paper had an editori note upon thi piec of new at the end
of which it remark as becam a parti and an antivaccin organ
the terror of thi filth diseas which in our father time amount
almost to insan no longer afflict us who know both that it
effect were exagger and how to deal with it by isol without
recours to the socal vaccin remedi which ar now reject by a
larg proport of the popul of these island still as we have
ascertain by inquiri that thi unfortun man did undoubtedli spend
sever dai and night wander about our citi when in an infecti
condit it will be as well that the author should be on the
alert we do not want that hoari veteranth smallpox scareto rear
it head again in dunchest least of all just now when in view of
the immin elect the accustom us would be made of it by our
prejud and unscrupul polit oppon
no i said to myself as i put the paper down certainli we do not
want a smallpox scare just now and still less do we want the smallpox
then i thought of that unfortun redhead wretch crazi with the
torment of hi diseas and of hi hideou laughter as he hunt and
caught the children who made a mock of himth poor children scarc
on of whom wa vaccin
a week later i open my polit campaign with a larg public meet
in the agricultur hall almost up to the nomin dai no candid
wa forthcom on the other side and i thought that for the fourth
time i should be return unoppos of a sudden howev a name wa
announc and it prove to be none other than that of my rival of mani
year agosir thoma colfordnow like myself grow greyhead but
still vigor in mind and bodi and as much respect as ever by the
wealthier and more educ class of our commun hi appear
in the field put a new complexion on matter it meant inde that
instead of the easi and comfort walk over which i had anticip i
must fight hard for my polit exist
in the cours of my speech which wa veri well receiv for i wa
still popular in the town even among the more moder of my oppon
i dwelt upon sir thoma colford address to the elector which had
just come into my hand in thi address i wa astonish to see
a paragraph advoc though in a somewhat guard fashion the
reenact of the old law of compulsori vaccin in a draft which
had reach me two dai befor through some underground channel thi
paragraph had not appear thu show that it had been ad by an
afterthought and quit suddenli howev there it wa and i made great
plai with it
what i ask the elector of dunchest could thei think of a man
who in these modern and enlighten dai sought to reimpos upon a free
peopl the barbar infami of the vaccin act long ago we had
fought that fight and long ago we had releg them to limbo where
with such thing as instrument of torment papal bull and writ of
attaind thei remain to excit the wonder and the horror of our own
and futur gener
well would it have been for me if i had stop here but led awai by
the subject and by the loud cheer that my treatment of it purpos
flamboy never fail to evok forget too for the moment of the
redhead man i pass on to deduct our oppon had prophesi
i said that within ten year of the pass of the famou conscienc
claus smallpox would be rampant now what were the fact although
almost twice that time had gone by here in dunchest we had suffer
far less from smallpox than dure the compulsori period for at no
on time dure all these eighteen or twenti year had three case been
under simultan treatment within the confin of the citi
well there ar five now call out a voic from the back of the
hall
i drew myself up and made readi to wither thi untruth brawler with
my best elect scorn when of a sudden i rememb the redhead
man and pass on to the consider of foreign affair
from that moment all life went out of my speech and as it seem to
me the enthusiasm of the meet di awai as soon as it wa over i
made inquiri to find that the truth had been hidden from mether
were five if not seven case of smallpox in differ part of the
citi and the worst featur of the fact wa that three of the patient
were children attend differ school on of these children it wa
ascertain had been among those who were plai round the fountain
about a fortnight sinc although he wa not on whom the redhair
tramp had touch but the other two had not been near the fountain the
presumpt wa therefor that thei had contract the diseas through
some other sourc of infect perhap at the lodginghous where the
man had spent the night after bath in the water also it seem that
drawn thither by the heat in all two or three hundr children had
visit the fountain squar on thi particular even and that mani of
them had drunk water out of the basin
never do i rememb feel more frighten than when these fact came
to my knowledg for ad to the possibl terror of the posit wa
my constitut fear of the diseas which i have alreadi describ on
my wai homeward i met a friend who told me that on of the children wa
dead the maladi which wa of an aw type have done it work veri
swiftli
like a first flake from a snowcloud like a first leaf fall in
autumn from among the myriad on some great tree so did thi littl
life sink from our number into the silenc of the grave ah how mani
were to follow there is a record i believ but i cannot give it in
dunchest alon with it popul of about 50000 i know that
we had over 5000 death and dunchest wa a focu from which the
pestil spread through the kingdom destroi and destroi and
destroi with a furi that ha not been equal sinc the dai of the
black death
but all thi wa still to come for the plagu did not get a grip at
onc an iron system of isol wa put in forc and everi possibl
mean wa adopt by the town author who for the most part were
antivaccinationist to suppress the fact a task in which thei were
assist by the offici of the local govern board who had their
instruct on the point as might have been expect the parti in
power did not wish the polit posit to be complic by an outcri
for the pass of a new smallpox law so few return were publish
and as littl inform as possibl wa given to the paper
for a while there wa a lull the subject of smallpox wa taboo and
nobodi heard much about it beyond vagu and indefinit rumour inde
most of us were busi with the question of the hourth etern question
of beer it puriti and the method of it sale for my part i made
few inquiri like the ostrich of fabl i hid my head in the sand of
polit excit hope that the arrow of pestil would pass us
by
and yet although i breath no word of my fear to a live soul in my
heart i wa terribl afraid
chapter xii
the shadow of pestil
veri soon it becam evid that the fight in dunchest would be
sever for the elector which for so mani year had been my patient
servant show sign of rebel against me and the principl i
preach whether the voter were move by a desir for chang whether
thei honestli disagre with me or whether a secret fear of the
smallpox wa the caus of it i do not know but it is certain that
a larg proport of them began to look upon me and my view with
distrust
at ani other time thi would not have caus me great distress inde
defeat itself would have had consol but now when i appear
to be on the verg of real polit distinct the mere thought of
failur struck me with dismai to avoid it i work as i had not work
for year meet were held nightli leaflet were distribut by
the ton and everi hous in the citi wa industri visit by my
canvass who were divid into band and offic like a regiment
the head of on of these band wa my daughter jane and never did a
candid have a more abl or enthusiast lieuten she wa gift
with the true polit instinct which taught her what to sai and what
to leav unsaid when to press a point home and when to abandon it for
anoth moreov her person charm and popular fought for her
caus
on even as she wa come home veri tire after a long dai work
in the slum of the citi jane arriv at the model cottag outsid my
park gate have half an hour to spare she determin to visit a few
of their occup her second call wa on the smith famili
i am glad to see you now as alwai miss said mr smith but we ar
in troubl here
what is littl totti ill again jane ask
no miss it isnt totti thi time it the babi she got
convuls or someth like it and iv sent for dr merchison
would you like to see her she ly in the front room
jane hesit she wa tire and want to get home with her canvass
card but the woman look tire too and in need of sympathi possibl
also for natur is natur jane hope that if she linger there a
littl without in ani wai violat her promis she might chanc to
catch a brief glimps of the man she love
ye i will come in for a minut she answer and follow mr smith
into the room
on a cheap cane couch in the corner at the foot of which the child
totti wa plai with a doll lai the babi an infant of nearli
three the convuls fit had pass awai and she wa sit up
support by a pillow the fair hair hang about her flush face and
beat the blanket with her littl fever hand
take me mummi take me i thirsti she moan
there that how she goe on all dai and it fairli break my heart to
see her said the mother wipe awai a tear with her apron if youll
be so kind as to mind her a minut miss ill go and make a littl
lemonad iv got a coupl of orang left and she seem to like them
best of anyth
jane heart wa stir and lean down she took the child in her
arm go and get the drink she said i will look after her till you
come and she began to walk up and down the room rock the littl
suffer to and fro
present she look up to see dr merchison stand in the doorwai
jane you here he said
ye ernest
he step toward her and befor she could turn awai or remonstr
bent down and kiss her on the lip
you shouldnt do that dear she said it out of the bargain
perhap i shouldnt he answer but i couldnt help it i said that
i would keep clear of you and if i have met you by accid it is not
my fault come let me have a look at that child
take the littl girl upon hi knee he began to examin her feel
her puls and look at her tongu for a while he seem puzzl then
jane saw him take a littl magnifi glass from hi pocket and by the
help of it search the skin of the patient forehead especi just at
the root of the hair after thi he look at the neck and wrist then
set the child down on the couch wave jane back when she advanc to
take it and ask the mother who had just enter the room with the
lemonad two or three short quick question
next he turn to jane and said
i dont want to frighten you but you will be as well out of thi it
lucki for you he ad with a littl smile that when you were born
it wasnt the fashion for doctor to be antivaccinationist for
unless i am much mistaken that child ha got smallpox
smallpox said jane then ad aggress well now we shall see
whose theori is right for as you saw i wa nurs her and i have
never been vaccin in my life my father would not allow it and i
have been told that it won him hi first elect
ernest merchison heard and for a moment hi face becam like that of a
man in a fit
the wick he began and stop himself by bite hi lip till
the blood came recov hi calm with an effort he turn to jane
and said in a hoars voic
there is still a chanc it mai be in time ye i am almost sure that
i can save you then he plung hi hand into hi breast pocket and
drew out a littl case of instrument be so good as to bare your left
arm he said fortun i have the stuff with me
what for she ask
to be vaccin
ar you mad ernest she said you know who i am and how i have been
brought up how then can you suppos that i would allow you to put
that poison into my vein
look here jane there isnt much time for argument but just listen to
me for on minut you know i am a pretti good doctor dont you for i
have that reput havent i and i am sure that you believ in me
well now just on thi on point and for thi on occas i am go
to ask you to give up your own opinion and to suppos that in thi
matter i am right and your father is wrong i will go farther and
sai that if ani harm come to you from thi vaccin beyond the
inconveni of a swollen arm you mai consid all that ha been
between us as noth and never speak to me again
that not the point she answer if you vaccin me and my arm
fell off in consequ i shouldnt care for you a bit the less becaus
i should know that you were the victim of a foolish superstit and
believ what you were do to be right no ernest it is of no us i
can assur you that i know a great deal more about thi subject than you
do i have read all the paper and statist and heard the cleverest
men in england lectur upon it and noth noth noth will
ever induc me to submit to that filthi that revolt oper
he heard and groan then he tri anoth argument
listen he said you have been good enough to tell mesever
timeswel that you love me and forgiv me for allud to it but
i think that onc you were so foolish as to sai that you care for me so
much that you would give your veri exist if it could make me happi
now i ask you for noth half so great as that i ask you to submit to
a trifl inconveni and so far as you ar person concern
to waiv a small prejudic for my sake or perhap i had better sai to
give in to my folli cant you do as much as that for me jane
ernest she answer hoars if you ask anyth els of me in
the world i would do ity anyth you can think ofbut thi i
cant do and wont do
in god name why not he cri
becaus to do it would be to declar my father a quack and a liar and
to show that i hi daughter from whom if from anybodi he ha a right
to expect faith and support have no belief in him and the doctrin that
he ha taught for twenti year that is the truth and it is cruel of
you to make me sai it
ernest merchison ground hi teeth understand that in face of thi
woman blind fidel all argument and appeal were helpless then in
hi love and despair he form a desper resolv ye he wa veri
strong and he thought that he could do it
catch her suddenli round the waist he thrust her into a cottag
armchair which stood by and despit her struggl began to cut at the
sleev of her dress with the lancet in hi hand but soon he realis
that the task wa hopeless
ernest merchison she said as she escap from him with blaze ey
and catch breath you have done what i will never forgiv go your
own wai in life and i will go mine
to death jane
then she walk out of the hous and through the garden gate when she
had gone ten or fifteen yard she look back to see her lover stand
by the gate hi face buri in hi hand and hi strong frame shake
with sob for a moment jane relent it wa terribl to see thi
reserv and selfreli man thu weep openli and she knew that the
passion must be mighti which would bring him to thi pass in her heart
inde she had never love him better than at thi moment she love
him even for hi brutal attempt to vaccin her by forc becaus she
understood what instig the brutal but then she rememb the
insultsh to be seiz like a naughti child who will not take it
dose and in the presenc of anoth woman and so rememb she
harden her heart and pass out of hi sight toward the gatewai of
the grave
at that time jane said noth of her adventur to me though afterward
i learn everi detail of it from her and mr smith she did not even
tell me that she had visit the smith cottag until on morn
about eight dai afterward when some blunder servant inform us at
breakfast that the babi smith wa dead of the smallpox in the hospit
and that the other child wa danger ill i wa shock beyond
measur for thi brought the thing home the peopl live almost at my
gate now i rememb that i had seen the redhead tramp catch
the child totti in hi arm doubtless she introduc the infect
though strang enough her littl sister develop the diseas befor
her
jane i said when the servant had left did you hear about the smith
babi
ye father she answer languidli i knew that it had smallpox a
week ago
then why did you not tell me and how did you know
i didnt tell you dear becaus the mere mention of smallpox alwai
upset you so much especi just now with all thi elect worri
go on and i knew it becaus i wa at the smith cottag and nurs
the babi when the doctor came in and said it wa smallpox
you were nurs the babi i almost scream as i sprang from my seat
great heaven girl why you will infect the whole place
that wa what ernestdr merchisonseem to think he want to
vaccin me
oh and did you let him
how can you ask me such a question father rememb what you have
alwai taught me i said and with omiss she told me the gist of
what had pass between them
i didnt mean that i answer when she had done i thought that
perhap under the influenc of shockwel as usual you show your
wisdom for how can on poison kill anoth poison and unabl to bear
it ani longer make some excus i rose and left the room
her wisdom great heaven her wisdom why did not that fool merchison
insist he should have author over her if ani man had and now it wa
too latenow no vaccin on earth could save her unless by chanc
she had escap infect which wa scarc to be hope inde such
a thing wa hardli known as that an unvaccin person come into
immedi contact with a smallpox patient after the erupt had
appear should escap infect
what did thi mean it meant that within a few dai jane my onli and
darl child the veri hope and centr of my life would be in the
fang of on of the most dread and danger diseas known to
human more have never been vaccin that diseas wa sure to
strike her with it full forc and the type of it which had appear
in the citi wa such that certainli not more than onehalf of the
unprotect person attack came aliv out of the struggl
thi wa bad enough but there were other thing behind i had never
been vaccin sinc infanc over fifti year ago and wa therefor
practic unprotect with the enemi that all my lifetim i had
dread as i dread no other thing or imagin actual stand
at my door i could not go awai becaus of the elect i dare not
show fear becaus thei would cry look at the hangman when he see the
rope here sinc compulsori vaccin had been abandon we fought
smallpox by a system of isol so rigor that under it cruel
provis everi on of whatev ag rank or sex in whom the diseas
declar itself wa instantli remov to a hospit while the
inhabit of the hous whenc the patient came were kept practic
in prison not be allow to mix with their fellow we had return
to the prevent measur of centuri ago much as thei were practis
in the time of the great plagu
but how could i send my daughter to on of those dread pestpit
there at the moment of struggl to be a stand advertis of the
utter failur and falsiti of the system i had preach back my
statement with the wager of her life moreov to do so would be to
doom myself to defeat at the poll sinc under our byelaw which were
almost feroci in their sever i could no longer appear in public
to prosecut my canvass and if my person influenc wa withdrawn
then most certainli my adversari would win
oh truli i who had sown bounteous wa reap bounteous truli the
bird which i had sent out on their mission of evil had come home to
roost upon my rooftre
chapter xiii
harvest
anoth five dai went byto me thei were dai of most unspeak
doubt and anguish each morn at breakfast i wait for the come of
jane with an anxieti which wa all the more dread becaus i forc
myself to conceal it there had been no further convers between us
about the matter that haunt both our mind and so fear wa i lest
she should divin my suspens that except in the most casual wai i did
not even dare to look at her as she enter the room
on the fifth morn she wa late for breakfast not a common thing for
as a rule she rose earli i sent on of the parlourmaid to her room to
ask if she wa come down and stood await the answer with much the
same feel as a crimin on hi trial await the verdict of the juri
present the girl return with the messag that miss thern would be
down in a few minut whereat i breath again and swallow a littl
food which till then i had been unabl to touch
soon she came and i saw that she wa rather pale and languid ow to
the heat perhap but that otherwis she look much as usual
you ar late dear i said unconcernedli
ye father she answer i woke up with a littl headach and went
to sleep again it ha gone now i suppos that it is the heat
as she spoke she kiss me and i thoughtbut thi mai have been
fancythat her breath felt cold upon my cheek
i daresai i said and we sat down to tabl by my plate lai a great
pile of correspond which i open while make pretenc to eat
but all the time i wa watch jane over the top of those wearisom
letter most of them from beggar or constitu who want to know
on howev wa anonym from a person who sign herself mother
it ran
siraft hear your speech some year ago and be told that
you were such a clever man i becam a conscienti objector and would
not let them vaccin ani more of my children the three who were not
vaccin have all been taken to the hospit with the smallpox and
thei tell me for i am not allow to see them that on of them is
dead but the two who were vaccin ar quit well sir i thought
that you would like to know thi so that if you have made ani mistak
you mai tell other sir forgiv me for troubl you but it is a
terribl thing to have on child die of smallpox and as i act on
your advic i take the liberti of write the abov
again i look at jane and saw that although she wa sip her tea
and had some bacon upon her plate she had eaten noth at all like the
catch of a song echo through my brain that fearsom sentenc it is
a terribl thing to have on child die of the smallpox terribl
inde for now i had littl doubt but that jane wa infect and
if she should chanc to die then what should i be i should be her
murder
after breakfast i start upon my round of canvass and
speechmak oh what a dread dai wa that and how i loath the
work how i curs the hour in which i had taken up polit and sold
my honour to win a seat in parliament and a littl cheap notorieti among
my fellowmen if stephen strong had not tempt me jane would have been
vaccin in due cours and therefor good friend though he had been
to me and though hi wealth wa mine todai i curs the memori
of stephen strong everywher i went that afternoon i heard omin
whisper peopl did not talk openli thei shrug their shoulder and
nod and hint and all their hint had to do with the smallpox
i sai thern said an old friend the chairman of my committe with
a sudden outburst of candour what a dread thing it would be if
after all we av were mistaken you know there ar a good mani case
of it about for it no us disguis the truth but i havent heard
of ani yet among the calfworshipp that wa our cant term for those
who believ in vaccin
oh let be i answer angrili it is too late to talk of mistak
weve got to see thi thing through
ye ye thern he said with a dreari laugh unless it should
happen to see us through
i left him and went home just in time to dress there were some peopl
to dinner at which jane appear her lassitud had vanish and as
wa her manner when in good spirit she wa veri humor and amus
also i had never seen her look so beauti for her colour wa high
and her dark ey shone like the diamond star in her hair but again i
observ that she at noth although she who for the most part drank
littl but water took sever glass of champagn and two tumbler of
soda befor i could get rid of my guest she had gone to bed at length
thei went and go to my studi i began to smoke and think
i wa now sure that the bright flush upon her cheek wa due to what we
doctor call pyrexia the initi fever of smallpox and that the
pest which i had dread and fled from all my life wa establish in my
home the night wa hot and i had drunk my fill of wine but i sat and
shook in the agu of my fear jane had the diseas but she wa young
and strong and might surviv it i should take it from her and in that
event assuredli must die for the mind is master of the bodi and the
thing we dread is the thing that kill us
probabl inde i had taken it alreadi and thi veri moment the seed
of sick were at their wizard work within me well even if it wa
soi gasp when the thought struck mea merchison had recognis in
the case of jane by immedi vaccin the viru could be destroi
or if not destroi at least so much modifi and weaken as to becom
almost harmless smallpox take thirteen or fourteen dai to develop
cowpox run it cours in eight so even suppos that i had been
infect for two dai there wa still time ye but none to lose
well the thing wa easyi wa a doctor and i had a suppli of
glycerin lymph i had procur some fresh tube of it onli the other
dai to hold it up befor my audienc while i dilat on it foul
and explain the evil which result from it us suppos now that
i made a few scratch on my arm and rub some of thi stuff into
them who would be the wiser the inflamm which would follow would
not be suffici to incapacit me and nobodi can see through a man

pretend that i had strain it whatev i had preach to prove my
point and forward my ambit in truth i had never doubt the efficaci
of vaccin although i wa well awar of the danger that might
result from the us of impur or contamin lymph foul surround
and occasion perhap certain condit of health in the subject
himself therefor i had no prejudic to overcom and certainli i wa
not a conscienti objector
it came to thi then there were onli two reason why i should not
immedi vaccin myselffirst that i might enjoi in secret a
virtuou sens of consist which in the case of a person who had
prove himself so remark inconsist in thi veri matter would
be a mere indulg of foolish pride and secondli becaus if i did i
might be found out thi inde would be a catastroph too terribl to
think of but it wa not in fact a risk that need be taken into account
but where wa the us of weigh all these pro and con such foolish
doubt and idl argument melt into nothing befor the presenc
of the spectr that stood upon my threshold the hideou spot
pestil who had slain my father who held my daughter by the throat
and who threaten to grip me with hi fright finger what were
inconsist and risk to me compar to my live terror of the

crisi and by some strang fate even when it wa far from me throw
it spell over my mind and fortun till becaus of it i turn my
skill and knowledg to the propag of a lie so mischiev in it
result that had the world known me as i wa it would have done wise
to deal by me as it deal with a danger lunat
i would do it and at onc
first although it wa unnecessari as all the servant had gone to rest
i lock that door of my studi which open into the hall the other
door i did not think of lock for beyond it wa noth but the
privat staircas which led to the wing of the hous occupi by jane
and myself then i took off my coat and roll up my shirt sleev
fasten it with a safetypin to the linen upon my shoulder after thi
i lit a spiritlamp and sterilis my lancet by heat it in the flame
now have provid myself with an ivori point and unseal the tini
tube of lymph i sat down in a chair so that the light from the electr
lamp fell full upon my arm and proceed to scape the skin with the
lancet until blood appear in four or five separ place next i took
the ivori point and after cleans it i charg it with the lymph
and appli it to the abras be care to give each of them a
liber dose the oper finish i sat still awhil let my
arm hang over the back of the chair in order that the blood might dry
thoroughli befor i drew down my shirt sleev
it wa while i wa sit thu that i heard some movement behind me
and turn round suddenli to find myself face to face with my daughter
jane she wa cloth onli in her nightdress and a bedroom wrapper and
stood near to the open staircas door rest her hand upon the end of
a loung as though to support herself
for on moment onli i saw her and note the look of horror in her ey
the next i had touch the switch of the electr light and save for
the faint blue glimmer of the spirit lamp there wa dark
father she said and in the gloom her voic sound far awai and
hollow what ar you do to your arm
i stumbl and fell against the corner of the mantelpiec and scratch
it i began wildli but she stop me
o father have piti for i cannot bear to hear you speak what is not
true andi saw it all
then follow a silenc made more dread by the dark which the on
ghostli point of light seem to accentu
present my daughter spoke again
have you no word of comfort to me befor i go how is it that you who
have prevent thousand from do thi veri thing yet do it yourself
secretli and at the dead of night if you think it safer to vaccin
yourself why wa i your child left unvaccin and taught that it
is a wick superstit father father for god sake answer me or
i shall go mad
then i spoke as men will speak at the judgment dayif there is
oneand for the same reason becaus i must sit down jane and
listen and if you do not mind let it remain dark i can tell you best
in the dark
then briefli but with clear and keep noth back i told her
all iher fatherlai everi pitiabl weak of my natur open to
my child sight ye even to the terror of infect that drove me
to the act all thi while jane answer no word but when at length i
finish she said

year ago when you could have confess your mistak well it is done
and you were not to blame in the begin for thei forc you to it
and now i have come to tell you that i am veri illthat is why i am
heremi back ach dreadfulli and i fear that i must have caught thi
horribl smallpox oh had i known the truth a fortnight ago i should
have let ernest vaccin me it broke my heart to refus him the first
thing he ever ask of me but i thought of what you would feel and what
a disgrac it would be to you and nowyou see

meet again for rememb you ar not to come into my room i will not
allow you to come into my room if i have to kill myself to prevent

i should have been glad enough to leav thi lifeif onli i had
nevermet ernest and turn jane my daughter crept awai glide
up the broad oak stair back to the room which she wa never to quit
aliv
as for me daylight found me still seat in the studi my brain
torment with an agoni of remors and shame which few have live to
feel and my heart frozen with fear of what the morrow should bring
forth
after but on dai of doubt jane sick prove to be smallpox of the
prevail virul type but she wa not remov to the hospit for
i kept the thing secret and hire a nurs who had recent been
revaccin for her from a london institut the doctor i
direct myself although i did not actual see her not now from ani
fear of consequ for i wa so utterli miser that i should have
been glad to die even of smallpox but becaus she would not suffer it
and becaus also had i done so i might have carri infect far and
wide and should have been liabl to prosecut under our isol
law
i wish to give up the fight for the seat but when i suggest it
sai that i wa ill my committe turn upon me fierc
smallpox thei declar wa break out all over the citi and i
should stop there to sweep out my own grate even if thei had to keep
me by forc if i did not thei would expos me in a fashion i should
not like
then i gave in feel that after all it did not matter much as in ani
case it wa imposs for me to leav dunchest person i had no
longer ani fear of contagion for within a week from that fatal night
four larg vesicl had form on my arm and their presenc assur me
that i wa safe at ani other time thi knowledg would have rejoic me
more than i can tell but now as i have said i did not greatli care
anoth six dai went by bring me to the ev of the elect at
lunch time i manag to get home and wa rejoic to find that jane
who for the past fortyeight hour had been hover between life and
death had taken a decid turn for the better inde she told me so
herself in quit a strong voic as i stood in the doorwai of her room
ad that she hope i should have a good meet that night
it would seem howev that almost immedi after i left a chang
for the wors set in of such a charact that jane felt within herself
her last hour wa at hand then it wa that she order the nurs to
write a telegram at her dictat it wa to dr merchison and ran
come and see me at onc do not delai as i am dyingjan
within half an hour he wa at her door then she bade the nurs to
throw a sheet over her so that he might not see her featur which were
horribl disfigur and to admit him
listen she said speak through the sheet i am dy of the
smallpox and i have sent for you to beg your pardon i know now that
you were right and i wa wrong although it broke my heart to learn it
then by slow degre and in broken word she told him enough of what she
had learn to enabl him to guess the rest never dream poor child
of the us to which he would put hi knowledg be too ill inde to
consid the possibl of a futur in which she could have no part
the rest of that scene ha noth to do with the world it ha noth
to do with me it is a privat matter between two peopl who ar dead
ernest merchison and my daughter jane thern although my own
belief ar nebul and at time nonexist thi wa not so in my
daughter case nor wa it so in the case of ernest merchison who
wa a scotchman with strong religi view which i understand under
these dread circumst prove comfort to both of them at the
least thei spoke with confid of a futur meet which if their
faith is well found wa not long delai inde for strong as
he seem to be within the year merchison follow hi lover to the
churchyard where thei lie side by side
about halfpast six jane becam unconsci and an hour afterward she
di
then in hi agoni and the bitter of hi just rage a dread purpos
aros in the mind of merchison he went home chang hi cloth
disinfect himself and afterward came on to the agricultur hall
where i wa address a mass meet of the elector it wa a vast and
somewhat stormi meet for men mind were terrifi and overshadow
by the case of diseas which were report in everincreas number
and even the best of my support had begun to specul whether or no
my antivaccin view were after all so absolut irrefut
still my speech which by design did not touch on the smallpox scare
wa receiv with respect if not with enthusiasm i end it howev
with an eloqu peror wherein i beg the peopl of dunchest
to stand fast by those great principl of individu freedom which for
twenti year it had been my pride and privileg to inculc and on the
morrow in spite of all argument that might be us to dissuad them
fearlessli to give their suffrag to on who for two decad had prove
himself to be their friend and the protector of their right
i sat down and when the cheer with which were mix a few hoot had
subsid my chairman ask if ani on in the meet wish to question
the candid
i do said a voic speak from beneath the shadow of the galleri far
awai i wish to ask dr thern whether he believ in vaccin
when the meet understood the mean of thi jester question a
titter of laughter swept over it like a rippl over the face of a pond
the chairman also rise with a smile said realli i do not think
it necessari to put that queri to my friend here see that for nearli
twenti year he ha been recognis throughout england as on of the
champion of the antivaccin caus which he help to lead to
triumph
i repeat the question said the distant voic again a cold deep voic
with a note in it that to my ear sound like the knell of approach
doom
the chairman look puzzl then repli if my friend will come up
here instead of hide down there in the dark i have no doubt that dr
thern will be abl to satisfi hi curios
there wa a littl commot beneath the galleri and present a man
wa seen forc hi wai up the length of the huge and crowd hall
for some reason or other the audienc watch hi slow approach without
impati a spirit of wonder seem to have taken possess of them
it wa almost as though by some process of telepathi the thought which
anim the mind of thi question had taken a hold of their mind
although thei did not quit know what that thought might be moreov
the sword of smallpox hung over the citi and therefor the subject wa
of suprem interest when death is near whatev thei mai pretend men
think of littl els
now he wa at the foot of the platform and now in the gaunt power
frame i recognis my daughter suitor ernest merchison and knew that
someth dread wa at hand what i could not guess
there wa still timei might have pretend to be ill but my brain wa
so weari with work and sorrow and so occupi what wa left of it
in try to fathom merchison mean that i let the preciou moment
slip at length he wa stand close by me and to me hi face wa
like the face of an aveng angel and hi ey shone like that angel
sword
i wish to ask you sir he said again whether or no you believ that
vaccin is a prophylact against smallpox
onc more there were opportun of escap i might for instanc have
ask for a definit of vaccin of prophylact and of smallpox
and thu have argu till the audienc grew weari but some god of
vengeanc fought upon hi side the hand of doom wa over me and a
power i could not resist drag the answer from my lip
i think sir i repli that as the chairman ha told you the
whole of my public record is an answer to your question i have often
express my view upon thi matter i see no reason to chang them
ernest merchison turn to the audienc
men of dunchest he said in such trumpetlik and thrill tone
that everi face of the multitud gather there wa turn upon him
dr thern in answer to my question refer to hi wellknown view
and sai that he ha found no reason to chang them hi view ar that
vaccin is useless and even mischiev and by preach them
he ha prevent thousand from be vaccin now i ask him to
illustr hi faith by bare hi left arm befor you all
what follow i know not from the audienc went up a great gasp
mingl with cri of ye and shame and show him my
support on the platform murmur in indign and i round whom
the whole earth seem to rush by an effort recov my selfcontrol
rose and said
i am here to answer ani question but i ask you to protect me from
insult
again the tumult and confus swell but through it all calm as
death inexor as fate ernest merchison stood at my side when it
had di down he said
i repeat my challeng there is smallpox in thi citypeopl ar ly
dead of itand mani have protect themselv by vaccin let
dr thern prove that he ha not done thi also by bare hi left arm
befor you all
the chairman look at my face and hi jaw drop i declar thi
meet close he said and i turn to hurri from the platform
whereat there went up a shout of no no it sank to a sudden
silenc and again the man with the face of fate spoke
murder of your own child i reveal that which you hide
then with hi right hand suddenli he caught me by the throat with hi
left hand he grip my linen and my garment and at on wrench rip
them from my bodi leav my left breast and shoulder nake and there
patent on the arm where everi ey might read them were those proof of
my infami which he had sought
i swoon awai and as i sank into oblivion there leapt from the lip
of the thousand i had betrai that aw roar of scorn and furi which
ha hunt me from my home and still haunt me far across the sea
my stori is done there is noth more to tell
the end
