editor note
what wa the greatest fault of ayesha shewhomustbeobei
sure a vaniti so coloss that to take on out of mani
exampl it persuad her that her mother di after look upon
her fear lest should she live she might give birth to
anoth child who wa less fair
at least as her stori show it wa vaniti rather than love of
the beauteou greek kallikr that stain the hand of she
with hi innoc blood and amongst other ill brought upon her
the fear curs of deathless while still inhabit a sphere
where death is lord of all had not amenarta taunt her with the
wane of her imperi beauti eaten of the tooth of time never
would she have disobei the command of her master the prophet
noot and enter that fire of immort which she wa set to
guard
thu it seem that by denial she would have escap the net of
mani woe in which perchanc she is still entangl and of
ayesha daughter of wisdom yet folli slave there would have
been no tale to tell and from her parabl of the etern war of
flesh and spirit there would have been no lesson to be learn
but vanityor wa it fatel her down anoth road

introductori
the manuscript of which the content ar print here wa discov
among the effect of the late l horac holli though not until some
year after hi death it wa in an envelop on which had been
scribbl a direct that it should be forward to the present
editor at the appoint time word that at first he did not
understand howev in due cours it arriv without ani accompani
note of explan so that to thi hour he doe not know by whom it
wa sent or where from sinc the onli postmark on the packet wa
london w and the address wa typewritten
when open the packag prove to contain two thick notebook bound
in parchment or rather scrape goat or sheepskin and veri roughli as
though by an unskil hand perhap in order to preserv them if
expos to hard usag or weather the paper of these book is
extrem thin and tough so that each of them contain a great number
of sheet it is not of european make and it appear suggest
that it wa manufactur in the east perhap in china
there could be no doubt as to who had own these notebook becaus
on on of them the first written in red ink upon the parchment cover
in block letter appear the name of mr holli himself also on it
first page ar variou memoranda of travel evid made by him and
no on els after these follow sheet upon sheet of appar
indecipher shorthand mix up with tini arab charact thi
shorthand prove to belong to no known system and though everi effort
wa made to deciph it for over two year it remain unread
at length when all attempt had been abandon almost by chanc it
wa shown to a great orient scholar a friend of the editor who
glanc at it and took it to bed with him next morn at breakfast
he announc calmli that he had discov the kei and could read the
stuff as easili as though it were a newspap leader it seem that
the write wa an ancient form of contract arab mix in place
with the demot of the egyptiansa shorthand arab and a shorthand
demot difficult at first but onc the kei wa found easili
decipher by some six or eight live men of whom as it chanc
the learn scholar into whose hand it had thu fallen accident
wa on
so it came about that with toil and cost and time at length those two
close written volum were transcrib in full and translat for
the rest thei speak for themselv let the reader judg of them
there is but on thing to add although it is record in notebook
that had been hi properti clearli thi manuscript wa not written by
mr holli for reason which she explain it wa written with the hand
of she herself dure the period of her second incarn when at
last leo found her in the mountain of thibet as is describ in the
book call ayesha
chapter i
the hall of heaven
to the learn man ugli of form and face but sound at heart holli by
name a citizen of a northern land whom at time i think that onc i
knew as noot the holi that philosoph who wa my master in a past
which seem far to him and is forgot but to me is but as yesterdai
to thi holli i sai i who on earth am name ayesha daughter of
yarab the arab chief but who have mani other titl here and
elsewher have told certain stori of my past dai and the part i
plai in them also i have told the same or other stori to my lord
kallikr the greek now name leo vincei aforetim a warrior
after the habit of hi race and hi forefath who for religi
reason becam a priest of isi the great goddess of egypt and onc
i believ my mother in the spirit also i have told these or
differ tale to on allan a wander hunter of beast and a
fight man of good blood who visit me at kor though of thi i
said noth to holli or to my lord kallikr now known as leo or
the lion becaus as to thi allan i held it wiser to be silent
all these stori do not agre togeth sinc often i spoke them as
parabl or in order to tell to each that which he would wish to
hear or to hide my mind for my own purpos
yet in everi on of them lai hid someth of the truth a grain of
gold in the or of fabl that might be found by him who had the skill
and strength to seek
now my spirit move me to interpret these parabl and set down what i
am and whenc i came and certain of the thing that i have seen and
done or at the least such of them as i am permit to reveal by
those mightier than i of whom i am the servant as thei in their turn
ar the servant of other yet mightier than themselv
here in these asian cave i sit the hesea of the mountain the last
priestess of the worship of mother isi upon earth as aforetim i sat
amid the ruin of kor in libya
at kor for two thousand year i watch and wait till at length
reborn kallikr whom unwittingli i slew in a rage of jealousi
came back to me where i had slain him there becaus of the curs
that is on me and him i lost him again for in thi veri place too
i wa slain most horribl slain by an excess of life wherewith i
thought to make myself more beauti even than i wa and in strive
to overfil the vase shatter it to the vilest dust thu onc more
fate made a mock of me onc more i lost kallikr whom it is my
doom to desir in the flesh and to rais up in the spirit through time
untold
my soul pass out and on and here for a littl while it found a home
mask in the wither shape of an ancient priestess of my worship
as wa foredoom my lord came back to me and saw the shine soul
within that hideou shape and claim it with a kiss as i think the
bravest deed and the most faith that wa ever done by man in the
magic of that kiss as also wa foredoom my beauti great again
befor hi ey so that onc more i stand a glori upon earth now we
ar plight now if all goe well within a year we shall be wed
ay within on short year after i have born him back to kor and
unseal the hidden fire of life and plung him in it essenc
give to him my own gift of undi dai
and yet and yetwho know the end he press me sore and the
starv woman part of me is passion and weak and i mai yield and
if hi lip touch mine who can sai but that the fire within me will
destroi him the unfortifi and bring all my plan to dust and
nothing i am great set far abov mortal yet i plai against
forc i cannot see that ar greater than i and it mai pleas them
to snatch the cup from my lip and onc more to overthrow me for
even though the blood of god run in him as it run in all of us
who can stand against their master doom and it decre therefor
i name wisdom daughter name child of isi tonight am as full
of fear as ani mortal maid crave her lover beneath the moon and not
know but that war or chanc or the vile breath of sick mai
have born him awai into that gulf where all thing must be lost
until thei ar found again
from month to month leo my lord hunt upon the mountain after the
fashion of men and i ayesha brood within the cave after the
fashion of women ye i who am half a goddess still brood within the
cave after the fashion of women who wait and watch holli the
instruct who love me as all men must do bide here with me in
the cave and we talk togeth of ancient thing whereof the world ha
lost count for he is a learn man skill in the tongu of greec
and rome and on who think and perchanc rememb
but yesterdai he said to me that i who seem to know the past and to
whom door were open that cannot be enter by human feet should
write down what i know and have experienc that in time to come the
world mai be the wiser
thi the fanci ha taken me to do though whether i can persever to
the end i cannot sai he ha given me that wherein i can write ti
not the old papyru but it will serv and i have pen of reed and
can make ink of variou colour who in the bygon dai wa no mean
scribe also i sleep but littl whose bodi fill like a cup with
life need small rest and the long hour of the night pass wearili
for me who lie and brood upon what ha been and is to come search
the dark of the futur with ach fear soul moreov i am
abl to write in charact which with all hi learn holli cannot
read i who am not mind that he should know my thought and deed
and betrai them to my lord whom thei might caus to think the wors of
me
why then should i write at all for thi reason in certain matter
i have foreknowledg and my spirit tell me that in a dai to come at
the time appoint some will guess the secret of my script and render
it into tongu that all mai read so that when soon or late upon
the circl of my etern path i pass henc to whenc i came and
like to the firegod in the cave of kor am hid awhil thi record
will remain my monument ah there peep out the mortal in me for
see like ani common man or woman i would not be forgot even among the
pass dweller in a petti world
now to my task
i have a vision of what chanc to my soul befor it descend to
dwell on earth and with it i will begin mayb it is but a parabl
not to be strictli render a token and a symbol rather than a truth
yet of thi i am sure that in it there is someth of the truth
sinc otherwis why through the long centuri did it return to me
again and yet again mayb greec and egypt had no god save those
thei fashion for themselv holli tell me as did the wander
allan who also had some smatter of knowledg that zeu and
aphrodit and osiri and horu and ammon ar now dethron with all
their compani and lie in the dust like the shatter column of their
templ the mock of men who talk of them as the fabl of the earli
world so that of all the divin that i knew he of the jew
although chang of charact and counten alon is worship and
remain
doubtless it is so yet while man live alwai there is god though
hi shape be mani alwai there is the etern good as in the dream
the holi noot name the ultim divin and behold it is call
ammon or otherwis alwai there is evil and behold it is call set
or baal or moloch or otherwis alwai the stain soul of man seek
redempt and he who save is call osiri or otherwis alwai
natur endur and she is call isi or otherwis alwai the great
world that will not die strain and puls to new life and the life
bringer is call aphrodit or otherwis and so continu where
man is again i sai there wa and is and will be god or goodth
spirit name by mani name
i go to my windowplac in thi cavechamb and look out upon the
star shine countless in the frosti sky and lo there i see god clad
in on of the most gloriou of hi garment i look at the moth
flit round my lamp or rest on the wall and by the magic that
is in it summon it mate from far and lo there i see god in
anoth of hi humbler garment for god is in all thing and
everywher and from the great sun down to him who sent them forth
and to whom thei return again all that hath life must bow
thi is the vision wherein i read a parabl of etern truth
i ayesha daughter of yarab not yet of the flesh but abov and
beyond the flesh inhabit the hall of that great goddess of the
earth a minist of that which rule all the earth natur self as
now i know who in egypt wa name isi mother of mysteri
child she name me and messeng and in that dream or parabl
as a child wa i to her for i drank of the cup of her wisdom and
someth of her great wa in my soul
the goddess sat brood in her sanctuari where spirit came and went
bear tide from all land or empti at her feet the cup of
offer prayer about her fell her robe blue as the sky and over
the robe hung down her hair duski as the night and beneath her bent
brow shone her ey like star of the night in her hand wa the rod
of power and the footstool at her feet wa shape like the round
world there canopi with light she sat upon an ebon seat and
brood while round her beat music like sea wave upon the shore such
music as is not known upon the earth
i appear i stood befor her i abas myself i bow till my
forehead lai upon the ground and my hair swept the dust of the ground
she touch me with her sceptr bid me aris
speak child she said what messag dost thou bring from the
shore of nile how goe my worship in the templ of isi and ar my
servant faith to my law
then i made answer
o mother divin i have accomplish my embassi unseen a spirit i
have wander through the land of egypt i have visit thy templ i
have hearken to the council of thy priest i have watch thy
worshipp and read their heart thi is my report thy holi templ
ar empti thy priest neglect thine altar save a remnant who remain
faith thy worshipp bow themselv befor the shrine of anoth
goddess
how is thi goddess name o child of my love and wisdom
she is name aphrodit of the greek a peopl who have flow into
egypt also other folk know her as ashtoreth and venu her sanctuari
of sanctuari is at papho in cypru an island of the sea over
against egypt she is the queen of earthli love and love is the ritual
of her worship and she make a mock of thee o mother and of all the
ancient god thy brother and sister swear that thy dai and
their is done and that she ha risen from the sea to rule the world
and will rule it to the end here and there she reveal herself and
conquer by her beauti make all men to worship her and teach all
women to follow in her step and beguil as she doe so that thy veri
priest turn to her and thy priestess break from their vow and
wanton with them
all of thi i have learn o child and more yet it wa my desir
to hear it from thy lip that cannot lie sinc in thee dwell my
spirit hearken now i am mind to be aveng upon these fals
egyptian and thou shalt be the sword of vengeanc wherewith i will
smite them bring their ancient glori to the dust and for ever
set the yoke of bondag on their neck ay i am so mind and it
shall be done how i will teach thee afterward but first as i have
the power to do i who under the strength abov me am regent of the
ball of earth will summon thi aphrodit to my presenc here and now
and bid her speak out her heart to me
hear me aphrodit wherev thou art in earth or heaven aphrodit
i bid thee appear
then in vision the mother rose from her throne stand befor it
terribl to see she beckon with her sceptr north and south and
east and west utter the secret word of power thrice she beckon
and thrice she spoke the secret word and wait
there wa a stir at the end of the great hall and a sound of sing
behold float between the long line of the flameclad guardian of
that hall attend by her subject god her maenad and her maiden a
shape of nake loveli came aphrodit of the greek veil in her
curl lock and rope about with gleam pearl for necklac and
for girdl she stood befor the throne and bow to the majesti it
bore then ask in a laugh voic of music
i have heard thy summon mother of mysteri and i am here what
wouldst thou of me isi queen of the world how can the seaborn
whose name is beauti and whose gift is love serv thee isi queen
of the world
thu thou who art shameless thou born of the new god and fashion
from the evil that is in the race of menbi lift thy spell from
off my worshipp i know thy work drunken with desir thei flock
to thee in troop and for reward thou givest them the wage of their
sin thou layest wast their home thou defilest their maiden thou
turnest men to beast and makest a mock of them thy flower fade thy
joi fill the mouth with ash and those who drink of thy cup suck up
poison in their soul thy fair flesh is a rotten and thy perfum
ar a stench and the incens of thine altar is the reek of hell
therefor i command thee go back to whenc thou camest and leav the
world in peac
whither then should i go mother answer aphrodit with her
silveri laugh save into thy bosom whenc inde i sprang see
that thou art natur self and i am thy child stern is thy law and
sweet yet without me thou wouldst have none over whom to rule ay
without me would no child be born and not even a flower would blow
without me thou wouldst rule a wilder with but the wisdom of which
thou boastest to keep thee compani hearken we ar at war and in that
war i shall be conqueror for i am etern and all life is my slave
becaus my name is life get thee to thy heaven isi and rule there
with osiri lord of death but leav me the live soon their dai is
done and thei pass beyond my spell into thy dominion there treat
them as thou wilt and be content for then i have no more need of
them nor thei of me why of a sudden art thou so wrath with me whom
thou hast known from the begin is it becaus i take new name and
set up my altar in thine own egypt altar wreath with flower
leav all desol thine where prayer ar mumbl from starv
heart and cold hand make the offer of denial come now mother
isi let us plai a game and let egypt be the stake thou hast the
vantag there see that for aeon it ha bow to thy law and thy
yoke ha been upon it neck
what then o aphrodit dost thou promis egypt to which i and those
who rule with me have given great wisdom and hope beyond the
grave
none of these high thing mother my gift ar love and joi sweet
love and joi in which for a littl while all fear ar forgot small
gain thou mayest think look backward to the past and onward to
the futur thou whose ey ar upon etern yet thei shall prevail
isi in egypt thy dai is done there as elsewher thy sceptr
fall
if so wanton with it fall egypt that henceforth shall be the
world slave when conqueror after conqueror set hi foot upon her
neck then let her think on isi whom she ha forsaken and wail
fill her soul with thy swine food lo i depart leav my curs on
egypt have thy littl dai till befor the judgment seat we settl our
account no more will i listen to thy falsehood and thy blasphemi
till then wanton look on my majesti no more
so in that vision spoke the mother and wa gone with her flash
like lightn went the flameclad guardian that attend the
goddess leav the great place empti save for aphrodit and her
throng and for the soul of me ayesha who watch and hearken
wonder the paphian look around and laugh then glide to the
vacant throne and seat herself thereon laugh again till the
music of her mockeri echo from pillar to pillar fill all the
templ hall
it is an omen she cri what isi leav i take henceforth her
seat and power ar mine see now my minist i queen it here though
i wear no vultur cap or symbol of the moon whose brow is better
grace by these abund lock and whose sceptr is a flower whereof
the odour make men mad ye i queen it here as everywher though in
thi solemn melancholi fane i lack a subject
she glanc about her till her gloriou rove ey fell upon that
spirit which wa i
come hither thou she said and do me homag
now in my dream i that spirit who in the world am name ayesha came
and stood befor her sai
nai i am the child of isi and to her i bow alon
thinkest thou so she answer smile and look me up and down
well i have anoth mind it seem to me that soon thou wilt descend
from thi sad realm to the joyou field of earth that there thou
mayest fulfil a certain purpos for such is the fate decre for
thee now i aphrodit add to that fate and lighten it look behind
thee spirit that shall be woman
i turn and look there to behold a shape of beauti that i knew for
man so beauti wa he that my breast rose and the life in me stood
still he smile at me and i smile back at him then he wa gone
leav hi pictur stamp upon my soul
thi is what i add to that tragic fate of thine o spirit that shall
be woman take him the man appoint to thee who from the begin
wa alwai thine and as perchanc thou hast done befor in hi kiss
forget thy mother isi and thy crown of woe
thu thi vision end and though now i ayesha have learn that
isi as we knew and name her in the ancient time is but a symbol of
that etern holi which is set abov all heaven and all earth i
sai again that as i believ in it parabl is hid someth of the
changeless truth
chapter ii
noot the prophet come to ozal
such is the vision such the dream that ha haunt me through the
centuri and brood over it from ag to ag i ayesha doubt not
that in it substanc it is true though it trap mai be fanci
wrought at least thi i know that my spirit is the child of immort
wisdom such as onc men believ that isi held as my undi shape
is born of the beauti that is fabl aphrodit gift at least it is
certain that even befor i dip me in the fire of life the most of
learn and all human loveli were mine i know also that it wa
my mission to bring egypt to the dust and did i not bring it to the
dust smite to it heart through proud sidon and cypru
aphrodit home and have i not for these deed born aphrodit
curs as becaus of aphrodit yoke laid upon my helpless neck i
have born and bear the curs of isi i whose destini it is thu at
onc to be the instrument and sport of rival power whose battl
ground is the heart of everi on of us
ala were my tale known the world in it hast might judg me hardli
and think that i who by burn it phoenician prop overturn an
ancient empir am cruelnatur or that becaus i sought the love of
a certain man and in my anger slew him when he turn from me which
in truth i did not desir to do that i am wanton and ungovern yet
these thing ar not so see that it wa fate not i that gave
egypt to the persian dog whom in hi turn i overthrew and made of
it peopl slave and my flesh not i which after i had tast of
the fire that is natur soul curs me with passion and it fruit
perchanc becaus i hate it and would never bow myself to it wholli
i who follow after puriti desir not man love but wisdom
gift and a crown of spiritu gold
moreov i had earthli and righteou warrant to bring about sidon
fall and through it that of egypt see that their king would have
put me to utter shame and rob my father of hi life as shall be
told so too i had the warrant of a woman heart to worship the man
i sought and for the death i brought upon him in my jealou mad my
soul ha paid full measur in remors and tear still sinc justic
is hard to come by here on the earth or even in the heaven abov i
know that some would judg me harshli and must bear it with the rest
even holli and at time my lord leo who onc wa name kallikr
have cherish such thought though their lip dare not utter them
for i read it in their mind which to me ar as an open book
therefor never shall holli nor my lord either look upon thi
written truth lest therefrom thei might distil some poison of
mistrust doubt for it is sure that all men stain the white of
pure veriti to the colour of their twist mind therefor too i
write it in tongu and symbol that thei do not understand which yet
shall be deciph in their season
as i taught holli long ago in the cave of kor and truli though
afterward for some forgotten reason of my own or to give him food for
thought i mai perhap have chang my tale puzzl him with stori
of great alexand and the rest by my mortal birth i am an arabian of
the purest and most nobl blood born in yaman the happi and in the
sweet citi of ozal my father wa name yarab after the great ancestor
of our race and i hi onli child wa name ayesha after my highborn
mother of her whom i never knew for she wa gather to the bosom
of whatev god she worship but on moon from my birth thi is
said
at first she would not look upon me be anger becaus i wa not a
son but at length at my father plead she wa prevail upon to
command that i should be brought to her when she saw how fair a babe
heaven had given her such a babe as had not been known or told of
among our peopl she wa amaz and put up a prayer that she might
die thi those who knew her declar she did for two reason
first becaus forese my great she desir that i alon
should hold my father heart and that of all our tribe and secondli
becaus she fear lest should she live she might bear other
children whom she would hate when she compar them to my perfect
so it came about as amongst other my father told me often that her
prayer wa grant and have kiss and bless me for a while she
enter into rest
thi is the true stori of her end not the other which those who
envi me put about in after dai that ow to certain revel
which came to her at the time of my birth as to the deed which i wa
doom to do and the love and hate which i wa doom to earn my
mother thought it better to ask death from her god rather than to
continu in a life which she must live out at my side thi tale my
father often swore to me when i ask him of it wa as fals as the
chang pictur which ar seen at sunset on the desert and
sometim at noondai also
for the rest thi belov father of mine took no other wife while i
wa yet a child fear lest for her own sake or her children she
should be jealou and maltreat me and afterward when i becam a
maiden becaus i would not suffer that anoth woman should share the
rule of hi household with me as i show to him he had servant in
plenti and these should be enough to which he bow hi head and
answer that without doubt my will wa that of god
thu it came about that i grew up with my nobl father hi advis
and hi strength and through him or rather with him rule all hi
great tribe who alwai worship me be it admit that from the
first or at least from the time that i came to womanhood i brought
him troubl as well as bless though through no fault of my own
but becaus of the beauti with which as in those dai i believ
isi or aphrodit or both of them had endow me for their own
divin purpos veri soon thi beauti of mine also my wit and
knowledg were nois abroad through all arabia so that princ came
from far to court me and afterward quarrel and fought for be
gentleheart i said a kind word to everi on of them and left them
to reason out which wa the kindest
thi for the most part thei did with spear and arrow after the
fashion of violent and insens men so that there wa much fight
on my account which made my father some enemi becaus the peopl
of certain of the princ who were kill swore that i had promis
myself in marriag to them thi howev i had never done who
desir to marri no man that i might becom a slave coop up in a
fortress to bear children that i did not desir with some jealou
tyrant for their father nai be higherheart than ani of my
time alreadi i sought to rule the world and if i must have ani
lover to choos on whom i wish and when i wish to have done
with him
but at that time i ask no lover who myself wa in lovewith wisdom
knowledg i saw wa strength and if i would rule first i must
learn therefor i studi deepli take for master all the wisest
in arabia who were proud to teach ayesha the beauti daughter and
heiress of yarab the great chief who could call ten thousand spear to
hi standard all of hi own tribe and ten thousand more sworn to us
but not of our blood
i learn of the star a deep learn thi that taught my soul it
littl though it is true that while i studi i wonder as
still i wonder now in which of them i wa destin to rule when my
dai on earth wa done for alwai from the begin i knew that
wherev i am there i must be the first and reign
perchanc i had learn thi aforetim in the hall of isi who then
to me had seem so great though afterward contempl those star
in the silenc of the desert night i came to understand that even the
univers mother as men name her in those far dai wa herself but
small on who must fight for sovereignti with aphrodit and other
god
holli ha told me much of what the astronom in these latter year
have won of natur secret of how thei number and weigh the star
and measur to a mile their infinit distanc from the earth and how
assuredli that each of them even the farthest is a sun as great or
greater than our own round which revolv world unseen he ha been
astonish also and affect to disbeliev when i answer him that
we of arabia guess all these thing over two thousand year ago and
inde knew some of them yet so it wa
thu commun with great my soul grew ever greater
moreov i sought other and deeper lore there wander a certain
strang man to our town ozal where my father kept hi court if so
it mai be call that is when we were not camp with our great
herd in the desert as we did at certain season of the year after
the rain had caus the wilder to throw up herbag thi man
name noot wa alwai ag and whitehair ugli to look on with a
curiou wrinkl face of the colour of parchment much such a face as
that of holli will be should he attain to hi year inde in thi
and other wai he wa so like to holli that often i think that in him
dwell someth of noot spirit now return again to earth as that
of kallikr ha return to leo
now thi noot who came to egypt none knew whenc for by birth he wa
not egyptian had been the highpriest of isi and kherheb or chief
magician in egypt on who had much power on earth and still more
beyond the earth sinc he wa in touch with thing divin moreov
he wa an honest magician and told the truth even to the king as the
god and hi wisdom show it to him and thi wa the caus of hi
downfal for woe betid those who tell the truth to king or to ani
who wield the sceptr of their might on a certain dai nectaneb the
first of that name the pharaoh of egypt whom other call nekht
nebf after a victori he had gain over the persian wa fill with
pride and took counsel with noot hi chief magician bid noot
search out the futur and tell him of glori to come to egypt and to
the royal hous after he had been gather to osiri that thereon he
might feed hi soul
noot answer that it wa wiser to leav the futur to care for itself
and to satisfi hi heart with the present and it joi and great
then the pharaoh grew wrath and bade him fulfil hi command
so noot bow and went and alon in some tomb or sanctuari drew the
circl utter the word of power and call upon the god he
serv to show him such thing as should befal to egypt and to
pharaoh hous
the magic sleep fell upon him and in it appear the spirit of truth
and spoke to him dread word of fate and doom these she bade him
deliv to pharaoh but when thei were spoken to fly for hi life

but becaus thei were alon togeth within a chamber befor he could
summon guard to kill him noot help of heaven fled awai out of

could not be found by the soldier who sought him
er daylight he wa far from the citi and disguis escap from

ancient sacr book of spell or word of strength that were hidden
in hi robe with these he brought moreov a littl ancient imag
of isi which he made us of in hi divin and prai befor by
dai and night
thu it came about awhil later on ev when i the young maiden
ayesha stood alon in the desert commun with my soul and draw
wisdom from the star that there appear befor me a wither
ancient man who when he saw me knelt down and bow to me i look
on him and ask
why ag on do you kneel to me who am but a mortal
ar you inde a mortal he ask methought that i who am the
headpriest of isi saw in you the goddess come to earth and inde
ladi i seem to see the holi blood of isi cours in your vein
it is true priest that of thi goddess whom my mother worship i
have dream and memori and that sometim she seem to speak with me
in sleep yet i tell you that i am but a mortal the daughter of yarab
the farfam i answer to him
then you ar that maiden whom i am command to seek she who is
name ayesha know ladi that great is your destini greater than
that of ani kind and that it is reveal to me that you will becom
immort
all who believ in the god trust to find the pearl immort
beneath death water o priest
ye ladi but the immort that is foretold for you is differ
and begin upon the earth and i confess that i understand it not
though perhap it mai be an immort of fame
nor i priest but meanwhil what would you of me
shelter and food ladi
and what can you offer for these priest
learn ladi
that i think i have alreadi
nai ladi ayesha not such learn as i can give the knowledg of
the secret of the god spell that will swai the heart of king
magic that will show thing afar and call ghost from the grave power
that will set him who wield it upon the pinnacl of worship
stai i broke in you ar old and ugli you ar tire your foot
bleed you seek protect and it seem to me that you need food
how come it that on who can command so much lore and power is in
want of such thing as these that the humblest peasant doe not lack
and must seek to purchas them with flatteri
when he heard these word of a sudden the aspect of that old man
chang to me hi shrunken bodi seem to swell hi face grew fierc
and set and a strang light shone in hi deep ey
maiden he said in anoth voic i perceiv that you ar in truth
in need of such a teacher as i am had you the inner wisdom you would
not judg by the outward appear and you would know that ofttim
the god bring misfortun upon those thei love in order that therebi
thei mai work their end beauti is your wit is your and a great
destini await you though with it as i think great sorrow yet on
thing is lack to youhumilityand that you must learn beneath the
rod of destini but of these matter we will talk afterward
meanwhil as you sai i need food and shelter which ar necessari to
all while still thei labour in the flesh lead me to your father
without more talk though not without fear i guid thi strang
wander to our tent for at the time we were camp in the desert
and into the presenc of my father yarab who gave him hospit
after the arab fashion but save for the common word of courtesi
held no convers with him that night
on the follow morn befor we struck our camp howev thei had
much speech togeth and at the end of it i wa summon to the great
tent
daughter said my father point to the wander who wa sit
crossleg on a carpet befor him after the fashion of an egyptian
scribe i have question thi learn man our guest i discov
from him that he is the first magician of egypt the headpriest also
of the greatest goddess of that land she whom your mother worship
at least he sai he wa these thingsbut now have quarrel with
pharaoh that he is noth but a beggar which is a strang state for
a magician also accord to hi tale pharaoh seek hi life as he
declar becaus of certain propheci that he made to him concern
the fate of egypt and of pharaoh hous it seem that he desir to
abid here with us and to impart hi wisdom to you which wisdom it
is evid ha brought him to an evil case now i ask you as on
gift with discret beyond your year what answer shall i return
to him if i keep thi noot here for that he tell me is hi name
though of hi race and countri he will sai noth perchanc pharaoh
whose arm is long will come to seek him and bring war upon us and if
i sent him awai perchanc i turn my back upon a messeng from the
god what then shall i do
ask him my father see that on who prophesi evil to the
pharaoh to hi own ruin must be a truth man
then my father stroke hi long beard be perplex and inquir
of the wander whether he should keep him or send him awai
noot repli that he thought that my father would do well to send him
awai but better to keep him he said that he had no revel on the
matter though if it were wish he would seek on but he believ
that although hi presenc might bring troubl from hi dismiss
would come yet wors troubl he ad that in a vision he had been
command by the goddess isi to find out a certain ladi ayesha and
becom her instructor in mysteri that the purpos of heaven might
be fulfil and that it wa ill to flout goddess whose arm were
even longer than those of pharaoh
now for the second time my father who did noth great or small
without my counsel ask my judgment on the matter after i had heard
the word of noot i ponder rememb what the wander had
promis to me in the desert name knowledg and the secret of the
god also spell that would swai the heart of king with the gift
of magic and of power at length i answer
to what end is all thi empti talk my father ha not thi stranger
eaten of your bread and salt and is it the custom of our peopl to
drive awai from their door for no fault those to whom thei have given
hospit
true said my father if he were to be sent henc it should have
been done at onc abid in my shadow noot and prai your god to
bring a bless on me
so noot the priest and prophet remain with us and from the first
dai of hi come open out to my eager ey all the scroll of hi
secret lore still it is true that he brought to my father not
bless but death as shall be told though thi did not come for
mani moon
meanwhil he taught and i learn for hi knowledg flow into my
soul like a river into the desert and fill it thirsti sand with
life of all that i learn from him becaus of the oath i swore
even now it is not law that i should write but it is true that in
those year of studi i grew near to the god and wrest mani a secret
from the clench hand of natur
moreov though as yet i did not take the vow i becam a votari of
isi as noot her highpriest had author to make me and on of
the inner circl ye i determin even then that i would forswear
marriag and all fleshli joi and make to isi the offer of my
life while she through her priest vow to me in return such power
and wisdom as had scarc been given to ani woman befor me
thu the time went by till at length fell the blow and ifor all my
wisdomnev heard aphrodit laugh behind her veil nor inde did
noot but then he wa an old man who as i drew out of him save
those of hi mother had not onc touch a woman lip all learn
wa hi but it seem that in hi search for it there were some
thing he had pass by at least so i believ or rather half
believ at thi time but as i learn afterward there ar matter
upon which even the most holi think it no shame to lie sinc in the
end noot confess to me that in hi youth he had been as ar other
men also i think that he heard the laughter of aphrodit though i
did not howev these thing mai be as i wa to discov afterward
mother isi is a stern mistress to whoever look the other wai
also although noot told me much he hid more not for mani a year wa
i to learn that he wa a citizen of the ancient ruin land of kor
and the onli on who knew the fear mysteri it hid which in a far
dai to come he wa command to reveal to me ayesha and to no other
man or woman nor did he tell me that it wa the purpos of heaven
that under her other shape and name of truth i should again establish
the worship of isi in that land and onc more make of it a queen of
the world yet these thing were so and therefor wa he sent to me
and for no other reason therefor wa he command to reveal the doom
of egypt to nectaneb that thi pharaoh in hi wrath might drive
him a wander to our tent at ozal there to dwell for year and
instruct me the chosen in all thing that i must learn so that when
at last the appoint hour dawn i might be fit for my mighti
task
but all thi while aphrodit laugh on behind her veil
chapter iii
the battl and the flight
in the end troubl came upon us thu as i have said alreadi my
beauti wa the talk of men throughout arabia and of women also who
were jealou of it sinc those who travel in caravan bore it
fame from tribe to tribe and those who sail upon the sea took up the
report and carri it to distant shore but now to thi tale wa
ad anoth name that the wearer of so much loveli wa also a
vessel into which the god had pour all their wisdom so that there
were few marvel which she could not work and littl or noth that
she did not know it wa ad truli enough that the channel through
which thi wisdom flow into her heart wa a certain noot who
aforetim had been kherheb in egypt and highpriest of isi
present thi tale carri by the marin came to the ear of the
pharaoh nectaneb in hi citi of sai who knew well enough that noot
wa the prophet whom he had driven from the land and whom by now he
desir to have back again for hi inspir counsel sake
the end of it wa that the pharaoh sent an embassi to my father
yarab demand that i should be given to him or to hi son the
young nectaneb i know not which in marriag and that noot should
return to egypt as my guardian and there be reinstat in all hi
offic
my father answer speak with my voic that least of anyth did
i desir to becom on of the women of pharaoh a man alreadi near the
grave or even of pharaoh son i who wa a freeborn arabian and
that as for noot hi head felt safer on hi shoulder in ozal where
he wa an honour guest than it would at pharaoh court
these word nectaneb took ill so ill inde that for thi and
other reason of polici he sent an armi to invad yaman the happi
and to captur me and kill noot or drag him awai to egypt in chain
of all these plan we had warn partli through the priest of isi
in egypt who still acknowledg noot as their head although anoth
had been rais up in hi place and fill hi offic and partli
through dream and revel that came to him from heaven therefor
we made readi and gather in great strength to fight against pharaoh
at length hi host came born for the most part in ship of cypru
and of sidon whereof at that time the king were hi alli or rather
vassal
thei land upon a plain by the seashor and watch from our hill
beyond we suffer them to land but that night or rather just
befor the follow dawn when their camp wa still unfortifi we
pour down upon them from our hill great wa the frai for thei
fought well i led the horsemen of our tribe in thi my first battl
and by the light of the rise sun charg again and yet again into
the heart of the host of pharaoh have no fear sinc i knew well
that none could harm me
there wa a certain compani of greek two thousand of them perhap
who serv pharaoh and in the centr of them wa hi gener which
compani stood firm when the other fled thrice we attack it with
the horsemen and thrice were beaten back then my father came to my
aid with hi pick kinsmen mount upon camel again we charg and
thi time broke through those about pharaoh gener saw me and
strove to make me captiv hope to carri me back to him whatev
happen to the host thei surround me on caught the bridl of my
hors him i slew with a javelin but other snatch at me then i
cri to isi and i think that she cloth me in some garment of her
majesti sinc foe well awai in front of me call out
thi is a goddess not a woman
yet i wa cut off ring round by them for all my companion were
slain or driven back
thei press in on me to take me live till i wa hedg in with a
ring of sword my father appear mount on hi swift white
dromedari that wa call desert wind follow by other thei broke
through the ring and there wa a fierc fight my father fell
pierc by the spear of the gener of the egyptian i saw it and
fill with mad i charg at that gener and drove my javelin
through hi throat so that he fell also then a cry went up and the
host of pharaoh melt awai fly for the ship some gain them
but the most remain dead upon the shore or were taken captiv
thu end that battl and such wa the answer that we of ozal sent to
pharaoh nectaneb therefor it wa also that becaus of the death of
my belov father at their hand i hate egypt and not onli egypt but
cypru and sidon in whose ship her host had been born to attack us
ye and swore to be aveng upon them all which oath i kept to the
full
now my father be dead i the daughter of yarab becam ruler of
our tribe in hi place with noot for my counsellor for certain year
i rule it well yet troubl arosein thi fashion by now the fame
of my glori and loveli had spread through all the earth so that
more even than befor i wa beset with demand for my hand from
chief and king who went wellnigh mad when i refus them in the
end be brother in their grief becaus i would have none of them
i whom thei call by the name of hathor and aphrodit and other
goddess fame for beauti accord to their separ worship thei
made a great conspiraci togeth and sent envoi bear a messag
thi wa the messag
that unless my peopl would give me up so that my husband might be
chosen from among their number by the cast of lot thei would join
their armi togeth and fall upon us and kill out our tribe so that
not on remain to look upon the sun save myself alon who should
then be the reward of him who could take me
now when i heard thi i wa fill with rage and have caus those
messeng to be scourg befor me sent them back to their master
bear my defianc but when thei were gone the elder of the tribe
came to me and said through their spokesman
o daughter of yarab o ayesha the wise and love we ador you as
on beyond price yet it is true that we love our wive and children
and desir to live not to die how can we who ar but few stand
against so mani king we prai you therefor ayesha to choos on
of them to be your husband for then becaus of jealousi doubtless
thei will destroi each other and we your servant shall be left in
peac or if you will not marri then we prai you to hide your beauti
elsewher for a while so that the king do not come to seek it here
i hearken and wa angri becaus of the cowardic of thi peopl who
set their own welfar about my will and refus to fight with those
who threaten me still be polit i hid my mind and said that i
would consid and give them an answer on the third dai then i took
counsel of noot and togeth we made divin and prai to the
god but most of all to isi
the end of it wa that befor the dawn on the second dai a small
caravan of five camel might have been seen had there been ani to
watch leav the citi of ozal and head for the sea
on the first of those camel sat an old merchant on the second hi
wife or hi daughter or hi woman heavili veil on the three
other wa hi merchandis woven carpet it seem to be though if
open those carpet would have prove to be fill with a veri great
treasur in gold and pearl and sapphir and other gem which for
gener had been gather togeth by my father yarab and those
who went befor him out of the profit of their trade and of their
flock and herd and hid awai against the time of need
that merchant wa noot the priest and prophet and that woman wa i
ayesha that treasur wa mine and the camel were led by certain men
who had serv my father and now serv me be sworn to me by
secret oath that might not be broken
we gain the sea and took ship to egypt in a vessel that i had caus
to be prepar ye befor we were miss the coast of arabia wa
behind us sinc i had given it out that i had gone to a secret place
to consid of my answer to the elder of the peopl as i heard
afterward when it wa known that i had turn my back on them there
were woe and lament in everi household of the tribe
understand what thei had lost the men among them beat their breast
and wept though it is said that some of the women rejoic becaus i
outshon them all and thei were jealou of me
afterward the king and chief of whom i have spoken descend upon
them to seek me whereupon my peopl swore that i had been chang
into a goddess and gone up into heaven some believ thi declar
that thei had alwai held me to be more than mortal but other of a
coarser common mind declar that i had been hidden awai and fall
on the tribe dispers it seiz mani and sell them into
slaveri
thu then did the children of yarab pai the price of their treacheri
to me though i have heard that afterward onc more thei becam a
great peopl under the rule of some baseborn grandson of my father
and worship me as a guardian goddess from gener to gener
have come to believ that i wa not a woman but a spirit whom the
god sent to dwell with them for a while
so noot and i came safe to naukrati a grecian citi upon the
canop mouth of the nile and there abod disguis as a merchant and
hi daughter trade in preciou stone and other costli ware and
thu ad to my wealth though of thi there wa littl need sinc
alreadi it wa great
it wa here that for the first time i went veil in the eastern
fashion in order to hide my beauti from the ey of men
under cover of thi trade i and noot live for two year or more while
i studi the lore and languag of the egyptian learn to read
their picturewrit which the greek call hieroglyph and master
their histori also i perfect myself in the grecian tongu and read
the work of their great writer as well as those of the roman
moreov i learn other thing sinc at the begin of the year
nectaneb the pharaoh who had sought me in marriag be now dead
and egypt for a while in the hand of the usurp zehir who some sai
wa hi son born of a concubin we travel up the nile disguis
and came to the ancient citi of thebe thi we did slowli stop
at everi great town where we receiv the hospit of the head
priest of the variou god ammon ptah and the rest sinc to these
priest noot by secret sign reveal himself inde the new of our
come wa pass on befor us so that alwai we found some wait to
welcom us who onc within the templ wall were treat like the
greatest although we were garb as humbl travel all of these
priest we found full of rage both becaus the god of the greek
and even of the persian and sidonian were be set abov their
own and still more for the reason that their revenu were seiz and
us to pai grecian mercenari so that thei who had been veri rich
were now poor and the god lack their offer nor could their
holi templ be repair
of all these thing i took note whose heart wa set upon on thing
onlyto bring about the fall of the egyptian and their alli that
had slain my father whom i love as inde i wa fate to do
therefor by a word here and a word there i blew the anger that
smoulder in them to flame hint of rebellion and the set up
of a new dynasti in egypt of which at that time i thought to be the
first a priestessqueen isiscometoearth of thi plan i hint
also through the mouth of noot nor wa it ill receiv sinc alreadi
those priest to whom he had told my histori and the revel that
had come to him concern me look on me as someth more than
woman could a mortal maid thei ask have so much beauti and so
much learn wa i not in truth a goddess cloth in woman flesh
onli on the road i purpos to tread there wa thi stumbl block
that each of those highpriest desir that he himself or at least
on who worship hi god were it ammon or osiri or ptah or
khonsu should be the pharaoh of that new dynasti for thei were
jealou each of the other and could not agre togeth as is common
among rival priest
we pass on to thebe where i saw the wonder of the mighti templ
which stood there rear by a hundr king which holli tell me now
ar but ruin though the great hall of column among which i us to
wander still stand in part also i cross the nile and visit the
tomb of the pharaoh
stand beneath the moon in that desol vallei of dead king for
the first time i think i came to know all the littl of life and
of the vaniti of earth life i saw wa but a dream it ambit
and it joi were naught but dust those king and those queen some
of them had been veri great in their dai the peopl worship them
as god and when thei stretch out their sceptr the world
trembl and now what were thei but name if so much as a name
remain of them
i saw a great queen whose tomb some while befor had been broken into
by robber persian or greek i wa told thei had unrol her mummi
and strip her of her royal ornament and there she lai she in whom
had centr all the world pomp a littl black and wither thing
grin at us from the dust like a dead ap a sight so strang and
unhuman that the priest who guid us a coars fellow broke into
laughter i rememb that laugh and afterward paid him back for it
though he never knew whenc hi misfortun came
i ayesha have mani sin to my count and at that time wa full of
fault as perchanc still i am todai thu i wa proud of my beauti
and my geniu which were given to me abov ani other woman passion
and reveng too and led on by ambit yet thi i swear by all
the god of all the heaven that ever in my secret self i have set
the spirit abov the flesh and desir to attain to anoth glori than
that of earth from the flesh came my sin becaus it wa begotten of
other flesh and the flesh is sin incarn yet my soul sin not
becaus it come from that which is sinless and it task
accomplish here laden with knowledg and purifi by suffer to
thi holi fount at last it shall return again at the least such ar
my faith and hope
so it came about that there in the vallei of dead king i swore myself
to the worship of god sinc all the god ar on god and to us the
world as a ladder wherebi i might climb nearer to hi throne
thu i swore with old noot for wit note that he shook hi wise
head and smile a littl at the oath for if i forgot aphrodit and
the flesh he rememb them or perchanc he to whom the futur
spoke alreadi guess someth of my fate which it wa not law
that he should tell also at that time i knew noth of that
everlast king of fire who dwell in majesti beneath the rock of
kor nor of hi evil gift least of all did i know that noot himself
wa by inherit and appoint the guardian of the fire
from thebe we pass up nile to phila on the isl of elephantin
where mother isi had her holi sanctuari and nectaneb the first of
that name he who had sought me as a wife and now wa not long dead
had begun to build a templ of surpass beauti to the goddess which
templ wa complet in my time by hi son the second nectaneb he
with whom i had to do and brought to nothing
here i abod a year make final prepar utterli to vow myself to
the goddess i kept the fast i purifi my heart i pass the
trial and at length alon i seem to die and descend into the gulf
of death and fled through the hall of death pursu by terror till
i saw or dream i saw the goddess in her glori and fell swoon at
her feet more i mai not sai even now that over two thousand year
have pass sinc that holi hour of fear and victori save thi on
thing which inde ha come to pass when i aros from that swoon
certain word were written on my mind though whether the goddess whom
i seem to see or some spirit spoke them to me i do not know these
were the word
far to the south in thi land of libya beyond the region of punt is
an ancient citi whenc my worship came er egypt had a peopl
thither daughter of isi shalt thou bear it back and there shalt
thou blow upon it with thy breath and keep aliv the holi spark that
at last is doom to die upon the earth amidst those snow which as
yet no southern foot ha trod there daughter in that fallen and
desert land my prophet noot shall welcom thee there shall he
guard the door of life which of mortal women thou alon shalt pass
there shalt thou stain thy hand with blood and there in solitud
amidst the tomb with tear from thy repent ey shalt thou wash
thy sin awai yet of the seed that thou sowest in fire in the womb of
the world thou shalt reap the harvest upon the mountain top amidst
the snow
such were the word brand upon my memori when i awok from the swoon
after the night of trial later i repeat them to noot my master
prai him to read their mean which either he could not or would
not do he said howev it wa true that far to the south there
stood a great citi now a ruin spars peopl whenc came the first
forefath of the egyptian thousand of year befor the pyramid
were built he said also that he knew the road to that citi by sea and
by land though how he knew it he would not tell nor would he
interpret the rest of those dream word yet when i harass him with
question he said carelessli as on who hazard a guess that
perchanc the goddess meant that it would be my lot after it fall or
corrupt in egypt to bear back her worship to thi it earlier home
and there establish a great nation of her servant as to the door of
life that i alon could pass of which he wa name the guardian and
the northern snow he declar that he knew not what wa meant by
them but doubtless these thing would be made clear in their season
so he spoke somewhat lightli like on who humour a frighten child
as though he would make me think that i had but dream a dream thi
inde i came to believ as is the fashion of mankind concern
thing that thei cannot see or handl howev real those thing mai
appear in the hour of their experi for these in the end alwai we
write down as dream such as haunt us by the thousand in our sleep
yet now that two thousand year have gone by i know that thi dream
wa true for is there not a citi call kor and wa i not there
doom to find the door of life whereof noot wa guardian and did i
not sin there and from gener to gener wash the blood from
off my hand with tear of bitterest repent and afterward expiat
that sin in loss and shame and agoni and lastli do i not reap that
harvest of tear upon the mountain top amidst the northern snow
whither the spirit bore me still hold in those hand the ember of
the worship of that regnant good who to us of the ancient world wa
known as the univers mother to whom i swore myself in phila
templ
but enough of these thing now let them be spoken of in their season
chapter iv
the kiss of fate
there came a man to phila watch from a pylon top whither i had
gone to prai alon i saw him land upon the island and from far off
note that he wa a godlik man clad in armour such as the greek
us over which wa thrown a common cloak hood as though to
disguis him on who had the air of a warrior at a distanc from the
templ gate he halt and look upward as though someth drew hi
glanc to me stand high abov him upon the pylon top i could not
see hi face becaus of the shadow thrown by the great wall behind
which the sun wa sink but doubtless he could see me well enough
whose shape wa outlin against the veil of golden light that must
have touch me with it glori though as that light wa behind me
my face also would be hidden from him at least he stood a littl
while as though amaz stare upward steadili then bow hi head
and pass into the templ follow by men bear burden
some pilgrim to the shrine i thought to myself then turn my mind
to other matter rememb that with men i had no more to do thu
for the first time here in the bodi all unknow i look upon
kallikr and he look on me but often afterward i have thought
that there wa a veil lesson or a parabl in the fashion of thi
meet
for did i not stand far abov him cloth in the glori of heaven
gold and did he not stand far beneath in the gloom of the shadow
that lai upon the lowli earth so that between us there wa a space
unclimb and ha it not been ever thu throughout the centuri
for am i not still upon the pylon top clad in the splendour of the
spirit and is he not still far beneath me wrap with the shadow of
the flesh and sinc as yet the secret of the pylon stair is hidden
from him must i not descend to earth if we would meet leav the
light and my pride of place that i mai walk humbl with him in the
shadow and is it not often so between those that love that on is
set far abov the other though still thi rope of love draw them
togeth uplift the on or drag down the other
the man pass into the templ and that night i heard he wa a grecian
captain of high blood on who though young had seen much servic in
the war and done great deed kallikr by name who had come to
seek the counsel of the goddess bring preciou gift of gold and
eastern silk the spoil of battl in which he had fought
i ask why such an on sought the wisdom of isi and wa told that
it wa becaus hi heart wa troubl it seem that he had been
dwell at pharaoh court as a captain of the grecian guard and
that there he had quarrel with and slain on who wa a brother to
him if inde he were not hi veri brother thi ill deed it wa
said prei upon hi soul and drove him into the arm of mother isi
seek for pardon and that comfort which he could not find at the
hand of ani of the god of the greek
again i ask idli enough why thi kallikr had kill hi familiar
friend or hi brother whichev it might be the answer wasbecaus
of some highli place maiden whom both of them love so that thei
fought from jealousi after the fashion of men for thi reason the
life of kallikr wa held to be forfeit accord to the stern
militari law of the grecian soldier and he must fly also the deed
had tarnish that great ladi name also hi heart wa broken with
remors and hither he came to prai isi to mend it of her merci he
who had forsaken the world
the tale move me a littl but again i cast it from my mind for ar
not such thing common among men alwai the stori is the same two
men and a woman or two women and a man and bloodsh and remors and
memori which will not die and the cry for pardon that is so hard to
find
ye i cast it from my mind sai lightlyoh those evilomen
wordsthat doubtless hi own blood in a dai to come would pai for
that which he had spilt
for a while some month inde thi grecian kallikr vanish
from my sight and even from my thought save when from time to time
i heard of him as studi the mysteri among the priest have it
wa said determin to renounc the world and be sworn to the servic
of the goddess noot told me that he wa veri earnest in thi design
and made great progress in the faith which pleas the priest who
desir abov all thing to convert those that serv grecian god
with whom the deiti of egypt and abov all isi were at war
therefor thei hasten hi prepar so that as soon as might be he
should be bound to the heavenli queen by bond that could not be
loos
at length hi fast and instruct were complet hi trial had
been pass and the hour came when he must make hi last confess to
the goddess and swear the aw oath to her veri self
now sinc isi did not descend to earth to stand face to face with
everi neophyt it wa necessari in thi great ceremoni that on
fill with her spirit should take her place and as mai be guess
that on wa i ayesha the arab to speak truth in all egypt becaus
of my beauti my learn and the grace that wa given to me there
wa none so fit to wear her mantl as myself inde afterward
thi wa acknowledg when with a singl voic the colleg of her
servant throughout the land men and women togeth promot me to
be her highpriestess and gave me who aforetim among them wa known
by the titl of wisdom daughter the new name of isiscometo
earth or in shorter word the isi for my own name of ayesha i
kept hid lest it should be discov that i wa that chieftai
the child of yarab who had defeat the armi of nectaneb
therefor at a certain hour of the night drape in the holi robe
wear on my brow the vultur cap and the bent symbol of the moon
hold in my hand the sistrum and the cross of life i wa
conduct to the pillar sanctuari and seat alon upon the throne
of blackest marbl with the round symbol of the world for my
footstool
thu have learn my part and the ancient hallow word that i
must sai i sat awhil wonder in my heart whether isi herself
could be more gloriou or more fair so inde did the priest and
priestess who saw me thu arrai and bent the knee to me as though
i were the veri goddess which in truth mani of the humbler among them
half believ
thu i sat in the moonlight that flow from the unroof hall beyond
while the carven god watch me with their quiet ey
at length i heard the sound of footstep whereon there came a
priestess and flung over me the white veil of innoc sewn with
golden star that until the appoint moment must hide isi from her
worshipp the priestess withdrew and wrap in the dark hood
robe that signifi the stain flesh about to be cast awai which hid
all of him so that hi face could not be seen came that tall neophyt
led by two priest who held hi right hand and hi left i note those
hand becaus thei were so white against the black of the robe
and even by the moonlight saw that thei were beauti long and thin
and shape though the palm of on the right wa somewhat broaden
as though by long handl of the tool of war
the priest led him to the entranc of the shrine and in hush
whisper bade him kneel upon a footstool and make hi sacrific and
confess to the goddess as he had been taught to do then thei
depart leav us alon
there follow silenc which at length i broke whisper
who is thi that come to visit the mother in her earthli shrine and
what is hi prayer to the queen of heaven and earth
though i spoke so gentli and so low perhap becaus of their veri
sweet my word seem to frighten him or perhap he believ
that he stood in the veri presenc of the goddess at least he
answer in a voic that trembl
o holi queen ador in the world i wa name kallikr the come
but the priest o queen have given me a new name and it is lover
ofisi
and what have you to sai to isi o loverofisi
o queen etern i have to tell my sin and ask her pardon for them
i who have pass the trial and am accept by her servant if it is
grant then to her i must make the oath bind myself etern to
love and serv her her and no other in heaven or on earth
set out those sin o loverofisi that my majesti mai judg of
them whether thei can be forgiven or ar beyond forgiv i
answer in the word of the appoint ritual
then he began and told a tale that made me redden behind my veil for
all of it had to do with women and never befor had i learn what
wanton those greek could be also he told of men whom he had slain
in war on of them in the battl against my tribe in which strang
enough it seem he had fought as a lad for thi man wa a great
warrior of these kill howev i took no account becaus thei
had been of those who were the enemi of himself or of hi caus
in stern silenc i listen note that save for these matter of
light love and fight the man seem innoc enough for in hi
stori there wa naught of base or of betray moreov it seem
that he wa on in whom the spirit had striven against the flesh and
who howev much hi feet were tangl in the poison snare of
earth from time to time had set hi ey on heaven
at length he paus and i ask of him
is the black count finish tell now the truth and dare to hold
noth back from the goddess who note all
nai o queen he answer the worst is yet to come i came to
egypt as a captain of the grecian guard that watch the hous of
pharaoh at sai with me came anoth man my halfbroth for our
father wa the same with whom i wa brought up and love as never i
love ani other man and who love me he wa a gloriou warrior
though some held that i wa more handsom in my person tisisthen by
name that in my grecian tongu in which i speak mean the aveng
thu he wa call becaus my father whose firstborn he wa desir
that he might grow up to work vengeanc upon the persian who slew hi
father name like myself kallikr the most beauteou spartan that
wa ever born foulli thei slew him befor the battl of plataea
whilst he wa aid the great pausaniu to make sacrific to the
god thi tisisthen my brother i kill with my own hand
for what caus did you kill him
there wa a royal maiden at that court on fairer than ani woman ha
been is or will beask not her name o mother though doubtless it
is known to you alreadi thi ladi both of us saw at the same time and
by the decre of aphrodit both of us love as it chanc it wa i
who won her favour not my brother we were spi upon the tale wa
told troubl fell upon that royal maiden who when she should be old
enough wa sworn in marriag to a distant king to save her name she
made denial as we must do she swore there wa naught between her and
me and to prove it turn her face from me and toward my brother i
came upon them togeth in a garden she had pluck a flower which
she gave to him and he kiss the hand that held the flower she saw
me and fled awai i madden with jealousi smote my belov brother
in the face and forc him to fight with me we fought he guard
himself but ill as though he care noth of the end of that frai i
cut him down he lai befor me dy but er he di he spoke
thi is a veri evil busi he said know kallikr my most
belov brother that what you saw in the garden between that royal
maid and myself wa but a plot to save you both sinc therebi i
purpos to take on to my own head the weight of your transgress
against the law of thi land becaus she prai it and it wa my
wish thi i have done and for thi reason i suffer you to slai me
though dure that fight twice i could have pierc you becaus you
were blind with rage and forgot your swordsmanship now it will be
said that you found me pursu thi royal maiden and rightli slew me
accord to your duti and that it wa i who love her and not you as
ha been commonli report yet in truth i love her well and am glad
to die becaus it wa to you that her heart turn and not to me also
becaus therebi i save both her and you yet kallikr my brother
the god give me wisdom and foresight in thi the hour of my death
and i sai that you will do well to have done with thi ladi and all
women and to seek rest in the bosom of the god sinc if you do
not great troubl will come upon you and through thi same curs of
jealousi such a death as mine shall be your also now let us who ar
the victim of fate kiss each other on the brow as we us to do when
we were children plai togeth in the happi field of greec from
whom death wa yet a long wai off forgiv each other all and hope
that we mai meet onc more in the region of the shade
so we embrac and my brother tisisthen gave up hi spirit in my
arm and look on him i wish that i were dead in hi place then
as i turn to go the soldier of our compani found me and see that
i had slain my brother would have brought me to trial not becaus we
had fought togeth but becaus he wa my superior in rank and
therefor i who be under hi command drew sword on him by the
law of the greek must die yet befor i could be put upon my trial
some of those who love me and guess the truth of the busi
thrust me out of our camp disguis with all the treasur that i had
won in war bid me hide myself awhil till the matter wa
forgotten o queen i did not desir to go nai i desir to stai and
to pai the price of my sin but thei would not have it so i think
inde that there were other behind great on of egypt move in
thi matter at least i wa thrust forth all be made easi for me
and all ey grow blind
again he paus and i ayesha cloth as the goddess ask
and what did you then you who could slai you brother for the sake of
a woman
then divin on i fled up nile where becaus of the troubl that
wa in the land pharaoh arm could not reach me nor the arm of the
command of the greek tarri not and without speech with that
high maiden who wa the caus of my sin i fled up nile
why did you fly up nile and not back to your own peopl o most
sin man
becaus my heart is broken queen and i desir to seek the merci of
isi whose law i had learn alreadi and to becom her priest i knew
that those who bow themselv to her mai look no more on woman but
thenceforth must live virgin to the death and it wa my will to look
no more on woman sinc woman had stain my hand with a brother
blood and therefor i hate her
now i ayesha ask
what god did you worship befor your heart wa turn to isi queen
of heaven
i worship the god of greec and first among them aphrodit ladi
of love
who ha paid you well for your servic make of you a murder of
on of your own blood who befor she blind your ey wa more to
you than ani on the earth do you then renounc thi wanton
aphrodit
ay queen i renounc her for ever never more will i offer at her
altar or look on woman in the wai of love if i mai have pardon for
my sin here and now i vow myself to isi as her faith priest and
servant here and now i blot the name of aphrodit from my heart yea
i reject her gift and tread down all her memori beneath my aspir
feet that at last shall bear my soul to peac
thu the man spoke in a quiver and earnest voic and wa silent
ye deep silenc reign in that holi place whilst i ayesha
although it is true that as a woman i misdoubt me of such rash
oath as the minist of the goddess prepar myself to grant pardon
to thi seeker in the hallow immemori word and to open to hi
troubl heart the door of puriti and rest etern
then suddenli in that silenc clearli i heard the sound of silvern
laughter soft sweet laughter that seem to come from the ski
abov and though it wa so low to fill the shrine and all the hall
beyond i look about me but could see naught it would seem too
that the greek heard also for he turn hi head and look behind
him then onc more let it fall upon hi hand
whenc came that sound could it be that she of papho nai it
wa imposs and not thu would i be turn from my offic i who
wa cloth with the robe and for that hour wield the might of isi
hearken o man in the world name kallikr i said on behalf
of isi the allmoth goddess of virtu and of wisdom speak
with her voic hear with her ear and fill with her soul i
wash you clean of all your sin and accept you as her priest
promis you light burden on the earth and beyond the earth great
reward for ever first swear the oath that mai not be broken and
then draw near that i mai kiss you on the brow accept you as the
slave and lover of isi from thi dai until the moon her heavenli
throne shall crumbl into nothing
have spoken thu let the word fall on by on slowli as the
tear of the penit fell upon the ground i utter the oath the
form of which even now i must not write
it wa a dread oath cover all thing and bind him who took
it to isi alon an oath that if it were forgot wrought upon the
traitor the agelong doom of death in thi world and woe in the world
to come till by slow step with pierc heart and bleed feet the
holi height from which he had fallen should be climb again
at length it wa finish and he said faintli
i swear with fear and trembl still i swear
then i beckon to him with the sistrum of which the littl shaken
bell make a faint compel music that alreadi he had learn to
follow and he came and kneel befor me there i laid the cross of
life upon hi head and gave him bless laid it upon hi lip and
gave him wisdom laid it upon hi heart and gave him exist for
thousand upon thousand of year all these thing i did in the name
and with the strength of isi the mother
came the last rite the greet of the mother to her child newborn
in spirit the rite of the kiss of welcom at that moment suprem a
light fell on me from abov perchanc it came from heaven perchanc
it wa an art of the watch priest i do not know at least it fell
upon me illumin my glitter robe and jewel headdress with a
soft splendour in the dark of that shrine at that moment too at
a touch my veil fell down so that the moonlight struck full upon my
face make it mystic and love in the frame of my flow hair
the priest newordain lift hi bent head that i might consecr
hi brow with the kiss of welcom and hi hood fell back the
moonlight shone on hi face also hi beauti face like to that of a
sculptur grecian god shape finefeatur largeei and
crown with littl golden curlsfor as yet he wa unshorn ye a
face more beauti than that which i had seen on ani man set abov a
warrior tall and sinewi form
by isi i knew thi face it wa that which had haunt me from
childhood that which often i had seen in a dream of hall beyond the
earth that of a man who in thi dream had been sworn to me to
complet my womanhood oh i could not doubt it wa the same the
veri same and look on it the curs of aphrodit fell upon me and
for the first time i knew the mad of our mortal flesh yea my
be wa rent and shatter like a cedar beneath the lightn
stroke i wa smitten through and through i the priestess of isi
proud and pure wa as lost as ani villag maid within her lover
arm
the man too he saw me and hi aspect chang the holi fervour went
out of hi ey and into them enter someth more human someth
more fate it wa as though he too rememberedi know not what
with a mighti effort of the will awar that the ey of the goddess
and perchanc of her priest also were upon me i conquer myself and
with beat heart and heav breast bent down to touch hi brow with
the kiss of ceremoni yet i know not howi know not if the fault
were hi or mine or perchanc of both of usit wa hi lip i
touch not hi brow just touch them and no more
it wa noth or at ani rate but a littl thing in on instant come
and gone and yet to me it wa all for in that touch i broke my holi
vow and he newsworn to the worship of the goddess broke hi ye
in the veri act of sacrific what drove us to it i do not know but
onc again i thought i heard that low triumphant laughter and it
came into my mind that we were the sport of an indomit power
greater than ourselv and all the oath that mortal swear to god or
men
i wave my sceptr the newmad priest aros bow and withdrew i
wonder of whom he wa the priestof isi or of aphrodit the
sing of a distant choir broke out upon the silenc the heiroph
came and led him awai to be of their compani till hi death the
ceremoni wa end my attend arrai as the goddess hathor and
nut conduct me from the shrine i wa unrob of my sacr
panopli and onc more from a goddess becam a woman and as a woman
i sought my couch and wept and wept
for had i not at the first temptat in my heart broken the law and
betrai the trust of her who as then i believ is and wa and
shall be her whose veil no mortal man had lift the mother of the
sun and all it star
chapter v
the summon
none knew my fault yet i knew and what is known to on soul is known
to all soul sinc on is all and all ar on moreov it wa known
to that which beget soul that from which thei come and to which
thei return again again to come as plato the great philosoph who
di befor my dai ha taught us in hi write also it wa known
to that accurs priest who wa the caus and partner of my crime i
wa overcom i wa eaten up with shame i who thought myself purer
than the mountain snow as inde i wa and in the flesh to thi
hour have remain
soon i could no longer bear my torment to noot i went noot the high
priest my counsellor and master and in a secret place kneel on my
knee there i told him all
he hearken with a littl smile upon hi wither face then
answer
daughter in your honesti you do but reveal that which i knewhow i
knew it matter not and now take comfort sinc the blame is not
altogeth your or even that of thi newmad priest whose foot wa
caught in the same snare you worship isi as i do but what is isi
whom we portrai on earth as a woman gloriou abov all women is she
not natur self the univers mother the suprem in whom all god
and goddess have a part she war on aphrodit it is true yet doe
not that mean that in veriti she war upon herself and ar we not as
isi is not on but mani pour into a singl mould for do we not
all war upon ourselv believ me daughter the human heart is a
great battleground where the higher and the lower part of us fight
with spiritu spear and arrow till on side or the other win
victori and hoist the banner of good or evil or isi or of set onli
out of a struggl come perfect that which ha never struggl is
a dead creatur from whom littl mai be hope the or must be melt
in the fire and lo the most of it is dross refus to be thrown awai
had it never known the fire there could be no pure gold to adorn the
brow of heaven nor even copper and iron to shape the sword of men
rejoic then that you have felt the hurt of fire
master i answer lord of wisdom to whom alon ayesha bow the
knee your word ar true and comfort yet bethink you and if it
is permit interpret me thi riddl i dream a dream of the time
befor my earthli daysyou know it well for i have told it to you i
dream of a place in heaven and of two goddess match against each
other and of a command that wa laid upon me to bring woe upon those
who had desert the on and turn to the other now if thei were
part of a singl whole why should thi command be laid upon me
daughter in your dream you were ordain to be a sword of vengeanc
not becaus the egyptian turn from on part of the holi uniti to
anoth part of that uniti but becaus thei have becom corrupt and
faithless worship no god save themselv and follow after
that which is low not that which is high such is my answer yet of
the truth or the falsehood of that dream i sai noth perchanc it
wa but a dream
perchanc master yet in that dream true or fals i saw a face
and lo a few night gone i drape as isi in the shrine i saw that
face again and knew it knew also that with it my fate is intertwin
what of thi
daughter who ar we that we should read the mysteri of fate we
who know not whenc we come nor whither we go nor what we have been
nor why we ar it mai be that you have some mission toward the spirit
that is cloth in the flesh of yonder man it mai be that you ar
destin to uplift that spirit and in so do yourself to be trodden
down if so i sai that in the end you shall rise again and bear him
upward with you
he paus and i knelt silent ponder the propheci for such i knew
it well to be then again he spoke
you heard a laughter in the shrine yet there wa no laughter save
that of the evil in your own heart mock and triumphant such
laughter mayhap you will often hear but while you can hear it and
repent be not dismai when the ear of the soul grow deaf then
utter loss is near while thei ar open hope remain those who still
strive can never wholli fall fate rule us everi on yet within the
circl of that fate power is given to us to work out our redempt i
have finish ask me no more
what punish master i ask
daughter thi for a while look no more upon that man i sai for a
while sinc with you i hold that hi destini and your ar
intertwin i have a command for you that present you accompani me
henc to land beyond the sea now go rest and in rest find
forget
so i went wonder yet comfort though i knew well that noot the
holi had not told me all no nor yet the half of what he knew for
often those to whom the god give vision ar forbid to speak it lest
as in the old hebrew parabl men should eat of the tree of knowledg
and grow like to them or perchanc thei cannot speak it sinc it
come to them in a tongu which mai not be render in the word that
the passerbi would understand so inde it is with me todai
thu it came about that soon i and my master noot left phila and as
befor travel the nile disguis never sinc then have my ey
look upon that island and it holi fane which holli who ha visit
it tell me is now a ruin with stark hathorhead column stand
here and there amongst the tumbl stone he sai moreov that hi
peopl who rule the land todai purpos to sink it beneath the nile
that the land below mai be enrich and multipli herein i see an
allegori the templ of isi ar drown and the learn thei held
is lost in order that more food mai grow to feed the common and the
ignor yet to what end see that if there is more food more men
will come to eat it all of them common and ignor while isi and
her wisdom ar swallow in the slime thu ha it ever been in egypt
and doubtless elsewher for such is natur law food breed
multitud and where carrion is there ar fli while in the desert
both ar lack yet i think that the desert and the few that wander
on them beneath the sun and star ar nearer far to god
onc more disguis as merchant i and noot my master took ship and
visit far land to see their state and gather wisdom we visit
rome then break her shackl and rise to her great thei
were a great peopl those roman that noot out of hi foresight told
me would on dai rule the world or perhap it wa i who told noot
judg them by their qualiti i am not sure at least i love them
not becaus of their rude natur their lack of art and their love
of power and gain therefor when i had studi their languag and
their polit i pass on
we came to greec and tarri there awhil studi philosophi and
other thing the greek i did love becaus thei were beauti and
call forth beauti from all thei touch also thei were brave who
defi the persian might and had thei but stood togeth might have
queen it on the earth but thei would not for ever state tore out
the throat of state so that in the end all were undon and
overwhelm by a multitud of common folk who held greec befor
them for such wa their destini moreov thei worship god made
like themselv with all the fault of men grown greater and more
vile and told fabl concern them fit to pleas children which i
thought strang in a peopl that could produc such philosoph and
poet yet those god had come down to them from their father and it
is hard to shake off the yoke of god until some greater god appear
and break it with the hammer of war
here in greec it wa that i pose to it most famou sculptor for a
statu of aphrodit or rather it wa as a mould of perfect womanhood
that i pose desir that thi sculptor who pleas me should have
on flawless model to copi in hi futur work for which he bless
me name that statu beauti self yet when i visit him a while
afterward i found that he had chang thi name to aphrodit
i wa anger who did not desir that my loveli should be
accredit to mine enemi and that of isi whom i serv and ask him
why thi had been done
he answer humbl enough becaus of a dream in which the paphian
had appear to him and threaten him with blind unless he gave
her own name to so divin a face and form moreov be in the
thrall of superstit he prai me even with tear that thu it
might remain sinc otherwis he must break that statu and as he
thought be blind as well so out of piti i let him have hi wai and
even gave him my hand to kiss in token of forgiv
thu it come about that aphrodit unasham throughout the ag ha
taken the tribut of a million ey cloth in a borrow loveli
so be it sinc what she ha stolen is but a fraction of the truth no
sculptor howev great can mould the perfect out of frozen stone
from greec still disguis as a merchant and hi daughter we
wander to jerusalem feign to trade in pearl and gem sinc
there i would studi the religion of the jew whereof i had heard so
much the citi of peac it wa call among the egyptian of old
time or so thei interpret it name but never found i on in which
there wa less of peac fiercefac were those jew and quarrelsom
reveng too and ever wage war public and privat upon on
anoth a peculiar peopl as thei name themselv full of hate
particularli of the stranger within their gate to trade with them
wa scarc possibl becaus he who sold them ware wa alwai left
the loser though for thi i who sought their philosophi not their
gold care noth
so i turn myself to the studi of their faith and found that god as
thei interpret him wa wellnigh as fierc as were hi worshipp
yet thi i will sai that he wa on god not mani and a true god
also sinc otherwis how could hi prophet have written so
glorious concern him moreov it wa their belief that he would
come to earth and lead them to the conquest of the world thi holli
tell me ha chanc though not in the shape thei hope sinc the
king who came would have led them but to the conquest of the evil that
is in the heart of men and to the knowledg of a life to be in which
thei had small faith therefor thei persecut and slew him as a
malefactor after their cruel fashion and what is now accept by
million so sai holli thei still reject
i preach to them for my heart burn in me at the sight of their
sacrific ye i preach to them against the shed of blood
tell them of a higher philosophi of gentl and merci for a
while thei listen then took up stone and stone me so that had i
and noot not been protect by heaven we should have been slain
after thi affront i turn my back upon jerusalem and it hooknos
fierceei peopl and went to cypru where i debat with the lewd
priest of aphrodit at papho thenc i got me back to egypt whenc i
had been absent mani year
at naukrati priest of isi who knew of our come how i cannot
tell perchanc noot had told them by messeng or in a dream as he
could do met us and conduct us up the nile to the templ of isi at
memphi here we were receiv in state in the great hall of the
templ and lo at the head of those who welcom us wa the greek
kallikr now by hi holi and zeal risen high in the servic of
the goddess
when i saw him beauteou as of old my heart stood still and the
blood rush to my brow
yet i gave no sign treat him as a stranger on whom my ey had
never fallen until that hour he for hi part stare at me with a
puzzl air then shook hi head as on doe who see a face that he
believ he ha met in dream and yet is doubt for be it
rememb thi man had look on me but onc when robe as isi i
receiv him into the compani of her priest at phila and then but
for a moment in the light of the moon perchanc he still thought that
it wa the goddess herself whom he saw thu and not a mortal at the
least he did not know that i the beauteou prophetess who came to
memphi after wander through the world wa the same as she who
had sat upon the throne of isi at phila and whom by chanc he had
kiss upon the lip mayhap even he did not rememb the kiss or if
he rememb set it down as part of the ceremoni thu if i knew
him but too well to him i wa a stranger
i bethought me of flight know in my heart that to me thi man wa
as the fabl sword that hung abov the head of damocl though what
harm i had to fear from him i did not know
again i sought the counsel of noot who smile and answer
have i not told you daughter that peril must be face sinc those
from which we flee will be swift to overtak us if destini ha
brought you and thi man togeth be certain that it is for it own
purpos sure you have learn your lesson and steel your soul
against all fleshli vaniti
ye my father i answer proudli i have learn my lesson and
steel my soul moreov your thought is my thought nor will i turn
my back on ani man here i bide defi woman weak and all the
wile of evil god
well spoken answer noot and bless me in the ancient word yet
as he did so i notic that he sigh and shook hi head
for mani a moon i know not how mani who have all time at my
command seem to have lost it petti count i remain there in the
templ at memphi of which soon i becam the prophetess and the head
of the priestess er long the fame of my divin spread far and
wide so that from all the land those who sought wisdom or knowledg
of the futur would come to consult me bring great gift to the
goddess though not on gem or piec of gold did noot and i keep for
ourselv who inde had no need of such common dross
so i sat in a carven chair in the sanctuari my divin bowl at my
side and utter dark sai like to those of the famou oracl of
the greek at delphi mani of which fulfil themselv for in
truth i think that there wa a spirit in mewheth it came from the
heaven or elsewher i do not knowwhich enabl me to read much that
wa pass upon the earth and even sometim that which had not yet
happen upon the earth so the renown of the ladi isi spread till i
becam a power in the land moreov thu i learn mani thing for
those who consult an oracl like those who seek the help of a
physician lai bare their soul keep no secret back
now at thi time egypt and all the countri round seeth with war
like a pot boil on the flame for year egypt had beaten off the
attack of the persian but now the pharaoh nectaneb the second of
that name who then sat upon the throne the last nativ king who
reign upon the nile wa threaten by artaxerx that on of thi
accurs race who as name ochu thi persian ochu had gather a
mighti forc to subdu egypt hundr of thousand of men ten of
thousand of horsemen hundr of trirem and of transport ship
the last act of the tragedi had begun of which the end wa to be the
crush of egypt who never more should know a pharaoh of her own
blood and choos of all these thing i learn through those who
came to consult the oracl of isi and much did i talk of them with
noot
now of myself dure these long year of quiet and prepar for
great event i will sai that the thing of earth behind me i grew
nearer to the divin and in the night time i commun with my soul
which seem to have becom a part of that which is abov the world
the greek kallikr i saw continu but no word pass between
us save such as had to do with matter of our faith and of the worship
of isi in whose servic he now stood high never did we interchang a
touch or a look of love he wa apart from me and i from him and yet
alwai in my heart i fear thi man thi beauti man the warrior
who had becom a priest for some prescienc told me that he would
bring disast on my head or i should bring it upon hi i knew not
which
so there we sat in the sanctuari noot the wise and ag who yet
never seem to chang kallikr the priest and i and alon or
togeth gave counsel to king and captain or utter oracl clear
seem our sky and free from troubl yet on the far horizon in my
spirit i discern the tempest cloud aris the terribl cloud in
which the lightn plai like the sword of destini that in a dai
to come were doom to overwhelm and pierc us through
nectaneb the second the pharaoh came to hi palac at memphi to
gather troop from upper egypt and made great offer to the god
seek their favour in the come war now i saw him for the first
time a grayhair fat heavyjowl man baldhead largenos
with great ey like to those of an ox such as nectaneb the
magician the consort with familiar spirit name the destroy a
titl which the god who hate him must have given him in ironi sinc
himself he wa doom to be destroi but on good thing can i sai of
thi nectaneb that he wa a lover of the art and rais gloriou
build to the god learn that i the highpriestess had dwelt
at phila he came to consult me as to the beauti templ with the
hathorhead column which he built there and through my counsel it
wa made perfect for i drew it plan or at least those of it
adorn holli tell me that even as a ruin although so small
there is no loveli build in all egypt
now thi pharaoh thought me a greek and did not know that i wa an
arab and the daughter of him of ozal in yaman whom hi father the
first nectaneb had brought to hi death becaus onc long ago i had
been refus as a wife to himself or to thi son of hi who now had
succeed him of these thing doubtless he rememb littl or
noth sinc that wa on of the smallest of egypt war but i i
rememb and swore that in payment for my father blood i would
bring hi accurs hous to ruin alwai also i receiv him veil
sinc i did not desir that he should look upon my beauti and inquir
concern my histori therefor as a prophetess had a right to do i
receiv the pharaoh veil
often he came to visit me becaus he had learn that i wa a mistress
of magic and he who practis magic much hope that i would teach him
secret he did not know and show him how to lai spell upon hi
enemi thi inde i did but the secret that i taught him were
evil and the spell were spear that when he threw them would fall
back upon hi head
so the scene wa set and at length came the summon to begin the plai
with the watch world for audienc
a write seal with pharaoh seal wa brought to the templ of
isi command noot the highpriest and me ayesha who now wa
name oracleofisi and the greek kallikr chief of the
ceremoni whose offic it wa to assist me in my divin to
attend the court of pharaoh and there declar to him the futur of the
war as it should be reveal to us by the great goddess whom we
serv at first we refus to go whereon there came anoth messag
which said that if we continu to refus we should be brought the
pharaoh wish to offer no affront to isi the messeng declar
but the matter wa urgent as great thing hung upon the revel
which we alon could make and some of the king and gener who were
gather in the templ as alli of nectaneb be the worshipp
of other god could not set foot in the holi shrine of isi
then there be no help for it we answer that we would come that
veri night at the rise of the moon
hastili consult togeth we plan the word of an oracl doubl
edg word that yet prophesi good to nectaneb and encourag him
to war for thu we believ we should most quickli bring about hi
downfal
yet as those word were never spoken i will not write them down
chapter vi
the divin
accompani by the priest and priestess of isi clad in their robe
and chant the holi song i wa born veil to the palac of the
pharaoh in a litter with it curtain drawn on my right hand walk
noot the highpriest whitebeard vener and on my left the
greek kallikr master of the rite
thu we came to the palac of which the outer court were fill with
grecian soldier of the guard some of whom in past year kallikr
had onc command although as a shaven priest of isi disguis in
hi white robe thei knew him no more these men stare at us readi
to mock and yet afraid as did phoenician sidonian men of cypru
and other who were gather in the court as though await some
great event
in an outer hall a captain of the guard bade our escort of priest and
priestess to await our return but we three that is i ayesha
noot and kallikr were summon to the small banquet chamber
where nectaneb with a few of the most highli place of hi guest
sat at their feast among these were the king of sidon two more king
from cypru three grecian gener some great nobl of egypt and
other also certain royal ladi were present and among them on who
instantli drew my ey to her she wa younger than iperch there
mai have been ten year between us tall slender and love in her
dark fashion with a strong quiet face and larg brood ey soft
as a deer and rather blue than black in colour
suddenli as we enter i who note all saw these ey grow frighten
like to those of on who see some spirit return from the hall of
death saw also the richhu face turn pale then grow red again as
the blood flow back saw the breast heav beneath the jewel
robe so sharpli that a flower fell from them and the lip of coral
part as though to utter some rememb name
wonder what had thu disturb thi beauteou royalti sinc i
be veil it could not have been the vision of myself i glanc
round and perceiv that kallikr who wa on my left but a littl
behind me had becom pale as a dead man and stood like on frozen
into stone
who is that royal woman i whisper to noot through my veil for
royal i knew her to be by the uraeu circlet she wore upon her raven
hair
pharaoh daughter amenarta he whisper back whom the greek
call the maiden becaus she will take no man in marriag
then i rememb a certain confess that onc i had heard sit
on the throne of the goddess isi at phila of how the penit had
love a girl of the royal hous of egypt and for her sake kill hi
own dear brother rememb also that thi penit wa none other
than the priest kallikr now i understood all and though
kallikr wa naught to me save a fellow servant of the goddess i
hate that amenarta and becam awar that between her and me there
wa war unend though how and why i knew not
next i look at a man clad in kingli robe who sat on pharaoh
right he wa a larg man of about five and forti year of ag with
dark handsom face and shift ey on with a jovial aspect which
yet i felt to be but a mask cover a heart full of evil scheme
from hi purpl robe sewn with pearl and the style of hi attir and
headdress i guess that thi must be tene the phoenician king of the
citi of sidon that wa report the wealthiest in the world which
citi have revolt had join egypt in it war against the
persian instantli i weigh that man in the balanc of my mind and
wrote him down as an ambiti rogu who wa also a coward and as i
judg from the mani charm he wore full of superstit
the other i had no time to studi for at onc the pharaoh began to
speak
greet prophetess he said rise from hi chair and bow to
us or rather to me greet highpriest of isi queen of heaven
mistress of the world greet also priest master of the rite of
isi pharaoh thank you all for thu promptli answer to hi
summon sinc thi night egypt need your wisdom more perchanc than
ever befor in all the ag of it histori
be pleas o pharaoh to set out what you desir of us the servant
of the etern goddess said noot

as you know the great war ha begun the mighti tene here king of
sidon my alli by the help of the greek i sent him ha defeat the

o pharaoh answer noot in bygon year when your father sat upon
the throne and i wa the kherheb ye the first magician of egypt
he ask me such question as these and have prai to my goddess
i answer him in the word that she command none heard these word
save your father himself for he and i were alon togeth yet there
wa that in them which made him wroth so that he sought to kill me
and to save my life i fled out of egypt go whither the goddess led
me afterward i wa call back to egypt where onc more i an high
priest of isi though the offic of kherheb is fill by anoth
how know i pharaoh if i obei you as i obei your father and again
the goddess should utter propheci which ar not pleas to the ear

i swear highpriest answer nectaneb eagerli that whatev

so noot drew near and pharaoh touch him with hi sceptr a cedar
wand surmount with a littl golden imag of horu which he alwai
carri becaus of hi thronenam which signifi horusofgold
moreov he recreat him kherheb and in token of it set upon hi
shoulder the gold chain from hi own neck and swore to him hi place
and power for life and the gift of an alabast coffin wherein to lie
after life wa done thi sarcophagu howev noot refus sai
darkli that it wa fate that he should sleep hi last sleep far awai
from egypt then he noot drew back and as he went i saw pharaoh
daughter rise and whisper awhil in her father ear he listen and
nod then he said
come hither priest who is name loverofisi and master of her
rite the royal ladi of egypt sai to me that in bygon dai when she
wa scarc a woman she think that befor you were a priest you held
some command amongst the greek of my guard as from your statur and
bear i can well believ she sai also that if her memori serv
her you slew some man in a quarrel and for thi reason fled awai and
sought refug with isi if such thing happen i have forgotten
them nor do i ask concern them let them lie yet lest you should
be afraid that old tale mai be told against you or vengeanc wrought
upon you come hither also and receiv pardon for the past and
protect and advanc for the futur and with these a gift from
pharaoh
now i marvel at thi ladi foresight and cun which show her
how to take advantag of pharaoh mood and safeguard on who onc had
love her all of which told me that she must be a wise woman as well
as beauteou also it told me that the worship of thi man had been
pleas to her then kallikr drew near and wa touch with the
sceptr moreov pharaoh spoke to him in like word that he had
spoken to noot pardon him all and promis him much moreov in
token of hi favour he gave him a gold cup of grecian workmanship
have two handl that wa chase about with the stori of the love
of aphrodit and adoni and border with a wreath of those anemon
which were fabl to have sprung from hi blood thi gloriou
flowerlik cup from which the guest when we enter were pledg
themselv in wine of cypru pharaoh lift from the board and sent
to kallikr a great gift which made it clear to me how deepli he
desir to propiti the goddess in the person of her servant
lastli the privat scribe wa command to write down these decre
that he had spoken which he did forthwith seal them with
pharaoh seal and give on copi to noot whilst keep the other to
be file among the record
thu noot and kallikr were protect from all thing but to me
the prophetess noth wa said as i thought for two reason first
becaus i wa known to pharaoh who as i have told had often
consult me upon matter of magic and secondli becaus as the voic
of the goddess i wa holi and abov reward or punish at the hand
of man thu i thought with how much truth shall be seen
the gift were receiv the papyru had been hidden awai in the robe
of noot and there wa silenc in the chamber to me ayesha thi
heavi silenc wa full of omen my soul made keen and fine with
ceaseless contempl of thing that ar abov the earth in that
silenc seem to hear the breath of the watch god of egypt to me
it wa as though thei had gather there to listen to the fate of thi
their ancient home on earth ye i felt them about me or at the
least i felt a spirit stir
the compani at the tabl drank no more wine and ceas from speech
thei sat still stare in front of them and notwithstand the
glitter of the ornament that proclaim their royalti or rule to me
thei were as dead men in a tomb onli the princess of egypt
amenarta seem to be aliv and outsid the circl of thi doom for
i note that her splendid ey sought the face the perfect carven
face of the priest kallikr and that though he stood with fold
arm and gaze fixedli upon the ground he knew it for now and again
covertli he glanc back at her
at length on of those guest could bear no more and spoke he wa a
closelip warworn grecian gener who afterward i learn wa
name kleinio of co the command of pharaoh mercenari forc
by zeu he cri ar we men or ar we stone or ar we shade in
hade let these divin divin and have done for i would get me to
my wine again
ay broke in tene king of sidon bid them divin pharaoh sinc
we have much to agre upon er i sail at dawn
then all the compani cri divin divin save amenarta onli
who search the face of kallikr with her ey as though she
would learn what lai behind it cold and priestli mask
so be it said noot but first i prai pharaoh to bid all mean men
depart
pharaoh wave hi sceptr and the butler and attend bow and
went then noot motion to kallikr who thereon shook the
sistrum that he bore and in hi rich low voic utter a chant to
the goddess that which wa us to summon her presenc
he end hi chant and noot began to prai
hear me thy prophet o thou who wast and art and shalt be thou in
whose bosom is lock all the wisdom of heaven and earth he prai
these king and great on desir knowledg declar it unto them
accord to thy will thei desir truthlet them learn the truth in
such fashion as thou shalt decre
then he wa silent none spoke yet it seem that a command came to
the three of us for suddenli noot look at the priest kallikr a
veri strang look next the priest kallikr rise from hi knee
laid down the sistrum and take the beauti cup that pharaoh had
given him went to the tabl and wash it with pure water from a
silver ewer then fill it to the brim from the ewer and brought it
to me ayesha now i knew that i wa command to gaze into that cup
and to sai what thing i saw
so i set it on the ground in front of me and kneel threw my veil
over it and gaze into the water in the shallow golden cup
for a littl while i saw noth till present a face form in the
water the face of the royal ladi amenarta which stare up at me
out of the cup ye it stare hard and seem to threaten me for in
it ey were hate and vengeanc then anoth face came and cover
it the face of kallikr the priest and in it ey were troubl
and desir
now i knew that the goddess isi or perchanc anoth she of the
greek spoke to me of matter that had to do with myself and not with
the fate of egypt in my heart i prai to the queen of heaven to rid
me of these vision though to give me other i did not prai her
sinc it wa my design to speak certain polit word which we had
prepar
yet other vision came unsought for some spirit possess me a
spirit of truth and destini thei were mani and all of them terribl
i saw battlefield i saw men fall in thousand i saw citi in
flame i saw that falseei king tene dead i saw the gener
kleinio of co also dead ly on a heap of grecian slain i saw
the pharaoh nectaneb fly up nile upon a boati knew it wa nile
becaus the current rippl against the prow of hi ship i saw him
seiz by black savag and throttl with a rope till hi tongu hung
out and the great round ey start from hi head i saw the templ
of egypt burn and a fiercefac drunken king hack at the
statu of the god with a persian sword and butcher the priest
upon the altar then i saw no more but a voic call in my ear
death to egypt death and desol death to her king death to her
priest death to her god finish finish all is finish
i cast the bowl from me it overset but lo there flow from it not
water but blood or darkhu wine stain the white marbl of the
pavement i stare at it all stare at thi godsent horror
a trick cri the princess amenarta she ha colour the water
behind the shelter of her veil
the other too especi the greek took up the cry echo
a trick a brazen trick
onli i note that pharaoh wa silent pharaoh who knew that ayesha
name isiscometoearth did not deal in trick pharaoh who
himself practis magic and had seen such omen sent by set lo
pharaoh look afraid and spoke no word onli glare with hi great
ey at the stain upon the marbl
what answer did the goddess give to your prayer prophetess ask
amenarta sneer at me

answer of blood
blood whose blood that of the persian
nai ladi that of mani who sit at thi feast and who er long shall
sit at the tabl of osiri and of thousand who cling to them yet be
comfort ladi not your blood i think that you have much mischief
to work er you sit also at the tabl of osiri or mayhap at that of
set i ad give thrust for thrust
declar then their name seeress
nai i declar them not go seek them for yourself ladi or let
pharaoh your father seek for is he not a magician though what god
give him vision i do not know you name me cheat or rather you name
the goddess cheat therefor the goddess is dumb and her prophetess is
dumb
ay i name you cheat she cri who in her heart wa mad with
fear and cheat you ar now let thi templ hag who hide her
hideous behind a silken screen unveil that we mai see her as she
is and let her be search and the vase of dye be taken from her
bosom or her robe
ay let her be search shout the guest who were also afraid
no need to search high lord i said in a quaver voic as
though i too were overcom with fear i will obei the princess i
will unveil yet i beseech you all make not a mock of me when you see
me as i am onc i wa perchanc as fair as that royal ladi who
command but year of abstin and the sleepless search for wisdom
mar the featur and wither the frame moreov time touch the
lock such of them as remain to me sinc these too grow thin with
ag yet i will unveil and the vase of preciou dye shall be the prize
of him who first can snatch it from my bosom or my robe
ay said on of them it wa the king tene and in payment for
her trick we will make her drink what remain of it to give colour to
her poor old carcas
ay i answer and i will drink what remain of it for i think
the stuff is harmless oh be not angri becaus a poor conjur plai
her trick
now noot stare at me as though he were about to speak then hi face
chang like to that of a man who of a sudden receiv a command that
other cannot hear he let fall hi ey remain silent and i
watch knew that it wa the will of the goddess or at least noot
will that i should unveil
i glanc at the priest kallikr but he stood still look like
apollo self frozen into stone
dure thi plai i had loosen the fasten of my veil and hood and
now of a sudden i cast them from me reveal myself clad as isi
that is in littl save a transpar cling robe fasten about my
middl on my breast hang from a chain of pearl were her holi
symbol carv in gem and gold and on my head her vultur cap
beneath which my tress hung almost to my feet have the golden
feather of the cap adorn with sapphir and with rubi and the
uraeu rise from it fashion of glitter diamond
ay i unveil and stood befor them my arm fold upon the
jewel girdl beneath my breast
behold king and lord i said the templ hag stand befor you
in such poor shape as it ha pleas the god to fashion her now let
him who can see it come take the vase that hide thi unveil
trickster dye
for a moment there wa silenc while those brutal men devour my
white loveli with their ey take count of everi beauti of my
perfect face and form amenarta stare at me and her ruddi cheek
went pale ye even the coral fade from her rich lip then from
between those lip there burst these word
thi is not a woman thi is the veri goddess bewar of her ye men

nai nai i answer humbl i am but a poor mortal not even royal
like to yourself ladybut a poor mortal with some wit and wisdom
though perchanc isi for a while to your sight ha touch me with
her splendour come take the vase er i veil myself again
then those men went mad all save pharaoh who sat brood
goddess or woman thei cri give her to us who henceforward can
never look upon the beauti of anoth
king tene rose hi coars face afir and hi shift ey fix
upon me greedili
by baal and ashtoreth he cri goddess or woman never have i
seen such an on as thi prophetess of isi hearken pharaoh befor
the feast we disput togeth concern a great sum of gold and in
the end it wa confess by you that it wa due to me in aid of my
cost of war although so you said it could not be found in egypt
save by raid the rich treasuri of isi perchanc the goddess
learn of thi design of your and by wai of answer sent us an evil
oracl i know not but thi i do know that she sent you also a mean
to pai the debt without cost to yourself or the rob of her sacr
treasuri give me thi fair priestess to comfort me with her wisdom
and otherwiseher the compani laugh coarselyand i will talk no
more of the matter of that gold
pharaoh listen without rais hi head then look on me with
roll ey and answer
which would anger the goddess most king tenesto lose her gold or
her prophetess
the former as i think pharaoh see that gold is scarc and
prophetessestru or falsear mani give her to me i sai
i cannot for my oath sake king tene
you swore an oath to yonder highpriest and to yonder man who look
like a grecian god clad in a priest robe and is call masterof
therit but to thi ladi you swore none
i swore the oath to isi king tene and if i break it doubtless she
will be aveng upon me go your wai the gold shall follow you to the
last ounc but the prophetess is not mine to give
now tene stare at me again and i who hate him with all my soul
gave him back hi stare with interest though thi did but seem to
inflam him the more then he turn on pharaoh furious and answer
in a cold voic
hear me pharaoh it is but a small matter yet my mind is set upon
thi woman who know the heart of the god and can pour their wisdom
into my ear therefor make your choic
in sidon there ar two faction of almost equal strength on of them
sai make an allianc with egypt and fight the persian ochu whom
alreadi you have defeat onc the other sai make an allianc with
ochu and as reward in a dai to come sit on pharaoh throne i have
taken the first counsel as you know yet it is not too late to chang
that counsel for a second which perchanc would prove the wiser if
there be aught in yonder divin and he point to the blood
stain upon the marbl floor then he went on
moreov i have my captain about me at thi board and those that
serv me without with all my fleet and therefor should it be chang
i need not fear to tell you so and to your face so i sai to you that
if you will not pleas me in thi small matter present my
ambassador go forth to susa with a messag for the ear of ochu to
which it would rejoic you to listen see that without the strong
aid of sidon and her fleet egypt cannot conquer in thi war
thu tene spoke and laid hi hand upon the pommel of hi short
phoenician sword
now the face of the pharaoh beard thu in hi own citi and at hi
own board grew red with rage and i saw that he wa about to answer
thi outland king defi him as mani of the great monarch who
fill hi throne befor him would have done but er he could speak
hi royal daughter amenarta whisper in hi ear and although i could
not hear her word i read their purport in her face thei were
tene speak truth without sidon you cannot stand against the
persian and egypt is lost let the woman go isi understand
will forgiv who otherwis must see the persian holi fire burn on
her altar
pharaoh heard and the anger written in hi ey wa chang to
troubl roll them in hi fashion he look on noot and said to him
as on who ask a question
i swore an oath to you kherheb and to yonder priest but to the
prophetess i swore no oath and perchanc egypt fate hang upon thi
busi
the old highpriest paus awhil like a man who await a messag if
so it seem to come for present he answer in a quiet voic
pharaoh is right egypt fate hang upon thi busi also
pharaoh fate also that of king tene and mani other the onli fate
which is not touch whether it be finish in thi wai or in that
is the fate of yonder seeress who is name isiscometoearth sinc
the goddess will protect her own settl the matter as you will
pharaoh onli settl it swiftli becaus under our rule it is time
that i and my compani who wait without should return to the templ to
make our nightli prayer and offer to the goddess the queen of all
the earth the queen of pharaoh and of egypt the queen of the king of
sidon and in the end the queen also of artaxerx ochu the persian
as on dai sure he shall learn
thu spoke noot unconcernedli and hear him i laugh for now i
wa sure that i had noth to fear from tene or ani other man upon
the earth therefor i laugh which that compani thought strang in
on who wa about to be born awai a slave and bade kallikr give
me my veil and hood also the cloak that i had thrown off when i
enter the banquet hall
he obei and while he wa assist me to cover up my beauti in the
fold of that veil i note that alon among all the men here present
thi beauti did not seem to stir him at all had he been cloth a
marbl statu or an ivori imag of the goddess as everi dai it wa
hi duti to do at sunris anoint it with perfum and garland
it with flower he could not have been less move or perhap so
truli had the priest in him overcom the man that he had learn to
cloak all the feel of a man or perhap it wa becaus that royal
amenarta watch hi everi movement with her ey i know not but
thi i do know that hi calm anger me and it came into my mind that
were i not the headpriestess of isi and sworn to her there should
be a differ tale to tell ye even in that moment of destini thi
came into my mind which show that in my soul i had not forgotten the
meet of our lip in yonder shrine at phila at least i have often
thought so sinc i who have had much time for thought
priestess you ar mine cri king tene in triumph make readi to
sail with me for sidon within an hour
do you think that i am your king tene i ask in a muse voic
as i fasten the fold of my veil and arrang the hood if so i
hold otherwis i hold that i ayesha a freeborn ladi of the ancient
arab blood am not the slave of ani phoenician who for a littl while
chanc to be a king but of her who is the queen of king isi the
mother nai tene i am more i am isi herself isiscometo
earth it seem that go with you i must sinc such is the will of
the goddess but phoenician take heed should you dare to befoul me
even with a touch i tell you that i have strength at my command and
that er long sidon shall lack a king and set shall gain a subject
for your own sake therefor and for that of sidon think again and let
me be
now the great jaw of tene fell and he stare at me openmouth
yet you shall go with me he mutter thickli and for the rest
ashtoreth rule in sidon not isi for know that there ar two queen
of heaven
ay tene a fals queen and a true and let the fals bewar of the
true
then i turn to nectaneb and said
is it still your command o pharaoh that i accompani thi alli of
your to sidon bethink you er you answer sinc much hang upon your
word
yea priestess it must be so i have spoken and my decre is
record the fate of egypt is more than that of ani priestess and
doubtless king tene will treat you well if not you sai that you
have strength to defend yourself against him
now as i answer i laugh lightli and the sound of my laughter wa

thei set me on board a great ship on the prow of which were imag of
certain god of the phoenician call by the greek pataeci not
unlik to that which the egyptian worship by the name of be
befor which imag burn fire there wa a royal cabin in that ship
which wa given to me and with it splendid robe and furnish of
gold for my tabl
at dawn we cast off from the quai of the whitewal citi while
thousand of the worshipp of isi who learn that i wa be
taken from them stood upon the quai and wail cry that the
mouthofisi wa sent awai to slaveri and that where her mouth
went there the goddess would follow leav vengeanc to fall upon
their head for that the headpriestess of isi should be given into
the hand of barbarian and their foreign god wa such a crime as had
not been known in egypt
therefor thei wail prophesi evil and i stood upon the stern
alon in my white robe veil and hearken to them for none dare
to come near to me ye i hearken and bless them with my hand
whereat thei knelt and wail the more
when at last we had pass down the nile and were out upon the great
sea sail swiftli for sidon over quiet water i ayesha have
taken counsel of the goddess and of my woman craft sent for king
tene who wa also on board the ship and receiv him in hi own
cabin that had been given up to me
for my heart wa black with rage against him and against nectaneb
pharaoh of egypt who had betrai me and in my heart i swore that i
would destroi them both ye there i the captiv sat and receiv
the captor king in hi own cabin purpos hi doom though how thi
wa to be accomplish as yet i did not know

for ayesha daughter of yarab highpriestess and prophetess of isi
the wisest and most beauteou woman in the world on who ha never
turn to look on man it is a veri small thing inde king tene it
is so small a thing that i will not deign to accept that proffer

upon a singl brow it is imposs
ay for you it is imposs king tene but for me it is possibl
i can gather them and set them on your brow and on my own i who have
within me all the wisdom of the earth and much of the strength of
heaven understand that if i desir it and you follow my counsel i
can crown you emperor of the world no less but the question is do i
desir it and will you follow my counsel
ladi i swear that you ar mad unless in truth you ar a goddess as
thei sai in egypt
perchanc i am somewhat of a goddess and be so marvel whether
for ani reward that can be given i shall debas myself by take such
a on as you to husband king tene now first look on me well and
answer whether you do inde desir me and ar readi to win me through
toil and danger or whether you will let me be for know tene that

wise what i must do and swear to me that when i am king of all
thing you will wed me
ay tene i swear that when you ar king of all thing i will wed
you i answer gentli laugh in my heart as i rememb that the
first and last of all thing the greatest of all thing isdeath
hearken you shall bring me to sidon not as a captiv but as a
strang goddess who ha come to aid you and your peopl and with
honour shall you receiv me in sidon caus your priest and
priestess to offer me worship and incens
and if so what then
then when i have studi your peopl and your prepar for war
we will take counsel togeth and i will show you how you mai prevail
tell me tene do you love pharaoh nectaneb
nai ladi i hate him who ask too much and give too littl as i
hate hi father befor him still we sleep in the same bed and prop
up the same wall and if on of us ceas to support the wall the
persian will push it down on both
i understand yet even so it come into my mind that perchanc you
would have been safer had you been push at the wall with the
persian ochu and not hold it up with the egyptian nectaneb
he glanc at me with hi shift ey and answer
i have had that thought as you know well but have rebel
against ochu defeat hi satrap and slain thousand of hi
soldier or rather those of hi father if i climb the wall i might
find spear wait for me on the farther side ladi it is too late
ye king tene perhap it is too late i will consid of the
matter in your interest and my own but first send me papyru and
write tool that i mai set down our pact when you have approv and
sign it then i will consid of thi and other matter and not
befor for the while farewel
he rose and went unwillingli enough and when i wa alon in the cabin
i laugh in my heart thi fish had been easi to hook but he wa a
larg fish and strong and i must bewar lest he pull me into the deep
sea where both might drown togeth moreov the man wa hate to
me more so even than that oxei heavyjowl pharaoh and hi
presenc seem to poison the air i breath yet if i enter into
thi pact with him doubtless i must breath it often which vex me
who shrank from men and their desir and abov all from thi man
yet he had done me wrong and insult he had help the egyptian to
make war upon my peopl and he had taken me as a slave me ayesha
think to make of me hi woman and cost what it might i would pai
him back as i would pai back nectaneb who sold me
the papyru wa brought to me by a slave and on it i wrote such a
contract as i think wa never sign by a king befor it wa brief
and ran thu
ayesha daughter of yarab highpriestess of isi prophetess of
isi known in heaven and among her servant as isiscometo
earth and child of wisdom to tene king of sidon
when you tene ar king not onli of sidon but of egypt cypru
persia and the east as i can make you if you obei me in all
thing then i ayesha vow myself to you as your sole wife and
queen but if er thi digniti is mine and your you dare even
to touch my robe then in the name of isi and speak with the
voic of isi i ayesha vow to you shame and death in the world
and after it all the torment of hell and the jaw of the devour
that await the judgment of truth on perjur soul beyond the sun
accept and seal by ayesha daughter of yarab and by tene
king of sidon
have copi thi write i sent it to tene by the slave that he
might studi it awhil later he ask audienc of me and enter
said in a thick voic that onli a madman would set hi seal to such
word
i look at him and answer that it wa noth to me whether he
seal or did not seal them inde that consid all i should be
better pleas if he let the bargain be
he stare at me and rage took hold of him who wa inflam with wine
who ar you he said that dare to talk thu to tene the king you
ar but a woman clad in the robe of a priestess who pretend to power
you have not why should i not take you and have done
now i mock him answer
becaus i think you love to sit upon a throne better than to lie in a
grave tene even in a king coffin still as you desir to know
more particularli i will put your question to the goddess who is not
far from me even on thi ship and tomorrow when the sun is up i will
pass on her word to youthat is if you live to look upon
tomorrow sun king tene i ad stare him in the ey
these word seem to sober him for he turn pale and left the
cabin make a sign to avert the evil ey but as i note take the
write with him yet me he left perplex and afraid for my heart
wa not so bold as my mouth
now that night whether by chanc or by the will of heaven a great
tempest sprang up suddenli the captain of the trirem a greek or a
halfgreek of naukrati philo by name whom now upon thi ship i met
for the first time came himself to warn me and to make sure that all
wa fast in my cabin he wa a quickbrain man veri activ in hi
bodi and pleasantfac with a brown point beard who had seen
some five and thirti year upon the earth i had made inquiri
concern him from a certain slave who attend me and wa told that
although he pretend to timid thi philo wa in truth a great
warrior and on of the best handler of a bow upon the mouth of the
nile sinc that which he aim at he alwai hit even if it were a
fowl in flight moreov he wa a veri good seaman and it wa said
faith to those he serv and a worshipp of the god
if so i answer to that old slave how come it that thi philo
instead of a humbl captain is not the first gener or admir
amongst the greek as a man of such qualiti should be
becaus divin ladi of certain fault answer the slave such
fault as have made of me what i am instead of the count of a nome
upon the nile as i should have been thi philo ha alwai thought
more of the welfar of other than of hi own which is a veri evil
weak also he ha love women too much which is a wors
vile sin inde i said more particularli the second the wise
alwai think of themselv first and the holi never love more than
on woman and her not too much which perhap is why the wise and the
holi ar so hate and so dull bring thi philo to me he is on
whom i should wish to know
in the end philo came though whether becaus my messag had reach
him or becaus of the advanc storm i am not certain at least he
came and as he bow befor me made a certain secret sign wherebi i
knew that he wa a worshipp of isi and on of high degre though
not of the highest sinc when i tri him with that sign he could not
answer still hi rank in our great compani wa enough and
thenceforward we spoke to each other under the seal of the goddess or
as our phrase went in those dai within the shadow of her wing as
brother and sister might or rather as mother and son
that is we did thi after i had prove him further and brought to hi
mind the fate of those who betrai the goddess and her minist upon
earth
thi philo told me in few word that although the trirem wa
egyptian and name hapi after the god of nile for thi voyag she
wa under charter to tene and for the most part man with
sidonian also with low fellow from cypru and the coastport
these like the phoenician guard of tene of whom there were fifti on
the vessel worship other god than those of egypt that is such
of them as worship ani god at all
mani of these men philo said warningli murmur becaus a priestess
of isi wa on board their ship which thei thought would anger the
phoenician god of whom the imag had been set upon the prow as might
lawfulli be done when a vessel wa hire by tyre or sidon
i answer laugh that as he and i knew isi could hold her own
against baal astart and all their compani then chang my mien
i ask him suddenli what he meant
onli thi holi on he answer that if by chanc the ship came
into dangerand i like not the sign of the sky and the moan of
the black north wind with rock not two leagu awai upon our lee
then i sai if thi ship came into danger as might chanc thi veri
night for here gale grow suddenlywel holi on you might be in
danger also in such case holi on sometim the phoenician demand
a sacrific to the cabiri the great god of the sea whom we do not
worship
is it so i answer coldli then tell them that those who demand
sacrific often furnish the victim have no fear my brotherinth
goddess but if troubl come call on me to help you
then i stretch out to him the sistrum that wa part of my
ornament of offic in which i had been brought aboard that ship and
he kiss it with hi lip and went about hi busi
scarc had he gone when the black north wind began to blow it blew
fearfulli rise hour by hour and even minut by minut till the
gale wa terribl the rower could no longer row for the great sea
broke their oar of which the handl struck them hurl them
backward from the bench and the sail thei tri to hoist upon the
mast wa torn awai and went flap down the wind like a wound
gull thu continu the hapi wa driven in toward the coast of
syria where still some mile awai the moonlight when it broke out
between the cloud show the white surf of breaker foam on the
iron rock of carmel
toward midnight the tall mast snap in two like a rotten stick and
went overboard carri with it certain men and crush other then
terror took hold of all the compani upon thi ship so that thei began
to cry aloud who believ that black death wa upon them
now on shout
we ar bewitch at thi season there should be no such gale it is
against natur
anoth answer
littl wonder that we ar bewitch when you carri with us a
sorceress of egypt on who hate our god wherefor thei ar angri
thi thei said becaus thei had heard the tale of the water turn to
blood also of the oracl i wa wont to utter in the templ at
memphi for in that citi dwelt mani phoenician who were great talker
and lover of strang tale though now holli tell me all their race
is silent for ever and the onli tale thei hear ar those of gehenna
then aros anoth shout from mani throat
sacrific the witch to the god of the sea throw her into the sea
that thei mai take her and we mai live to look upon tomorrow sun
next there wa a rush toward the afterpart of the trirem where i wa
in the cabin in the waist of the ship appear the captain philo as
i saw watch from between the curtain and with him a number of the
crew who were egyptian and faith to him perhap six in all not
more in hi hand philo held a bow and a drawn shortsword wa
thrust through hi belt
he shout to the mob of madmen to stand back but thei would not and
led by on of the guard of tene crept forward philo knelt rest
hi back against a watercask wait till the ship steadi herself
a littl on the crest of a wave then he drew the bow and shot veri
well and straight did he shoot for the arrow pierc that leader of
the guard of tene from breast to back so that he fell down dead
see thi the other grew afraid and stai where thei were
cling to the bulwark of the ship or whatev thei could grasp with
their hand
tene appear among them thei shout to him and he shout back to
them but what thei said i could not hear becaus of the howl of
the wind
philo crept into the cabin and hi face wa veri heavi
holi on he said make readi to join isi in the heaven fear
for hi own life that dog of a sidonian king ha consent to your
sacrific and i am come to die with you
the goddess thank you o greatheart man and i her servant
thank you also i said smile at him yet have no fear sinc my
spirit tell me that neither i nor you shall die thi night help me
now and let us go forth and talk with these hiss snake of sidon
but what will you sai to them holi on
the goddess will teach me what to sai i answer who in truth did
not know what i should sai all i knew wa that some spirit move me
to go forth and to talk with them
so we went i lean upon philo as it wa hard to stand upon my feet
and came to the stump of the broken mast in the midst of the hollow
ship all the mob of the crew draw back befor me here with on
arm i clung to the mast and beckon to them with the other in which
i held the sistrum of our worship thei drew near tene among them
hi face cover by a cloak
hearken i cri i learn that you would offer me the prophetess
of isi as a sacrific to your god fool is not isi greater than
your god o queen of heaven send a sign to show that thou art
greater than these foreign god
so i spoke and stare upward at the moon for the wind had torn awai
my veil and wait
a great billow came and struck the forepart of the ship buri it
deep in green water as she rose i saw two dark form fly from her
hightoss prow and a voic cri
the guardian imag have gone and the sacr fire is quench
ay i answer thei ar gone where you shall go everi on of
you if you dare to touch me know that i do not fear for my own life
which cannot be taken from me but for your live i fear and for
sidon which present shall lack a kingif you dare to touch me be
silent now and though you deserv it not i will prai isi to save
you
then gape on me stand there like on inspir as inde i think
i wa thei were struck to silenc and through the roar gale and
fly foam i prai to heaven to preserv that ship and those she
bore from the grind rock on which the surf beat not a mile awai
a marvel happen whether becaus the tempest had grown weari of it
rage or becaus that which hear the prayer of men had accept my
prayer for it own purpos to thi hour i know not at least the
marvel happen for although the sea still beat and rush wave
follow wave like whiteman countless charg steed of a
sudden the gale di down and there wa calm between sky and sea
it ha pleas the great goddess to hearken to me and to save your
live ye even the live of you who would have murder her
priestess i said in a quiet voic now get you to your oar and row
as never you row befor if you would hold the ship off yonder
rock
thei gasp thei stare with open mouth on said
thou art the goddess thou art the veri goddess pardon us
pardon us thy slave o queen of heaven
then thei rush to their oar and with toil and danger drew the
hapi past the promontori of carmel where the water boil upon the
rock and out into the deep sea beyond
what did i sai to you philo i said as he led me back to the
cabin
he made no answer onli lift the hem of my garment he press it
to hi brow
chapter viii
the king of sidon
next morn the sun came up in a sky of perfect blue and the hapi
driven forward by the oar sinc her mast wa gone pass northward
over a quiet sea not a leagu awai upon our right gleam like
gold were the roof of the gloriou citi of tyre set like a queen
upon her island throne tyre that as yet did not dream of evil dai
when her marbl palac should melt in flame and her merchant princ
and citizen lie butcher by the thousand in her street tyre the
wanton the beauteou the wealthi who suck rich from all the
land
see our shatter state a boat man by redcap seamen came
out from the egyptian harbour to learn if we need help but philo
shout back to it offic that save for the loss of a mast and some
men we had taken no harm in the gale and hope er night to be safe
in sidon
so the boat return and we row on
by middai we caught sight of the tower of sidon and within three more
hour the sea be calm had drop anchor in the southern harbour
now after we left tyre tene the king came to visit me in my cabin at
the sight of him my gorg rose for i rememb that thi dog of a
sidonian had consent to the demand of the sailor that i should be
hurl into the deep as a sacrific to hi god yet i restrain my
soul and receiv him smile and unveil
hail king tene i said isi ha been veri merci to you in
answer to my prayer for know that never again did i think to look
upon you live
you ar great ladi he answer stare at me with frighten yet
devour ey i think that you ar as great as that isi whom you
serv if inde you ar not that isi come to earth as thei name you
in egypt isi i know not who worship ashtoreth she who is also
style tanith and baalti and like your isi is an acknowledg
queen of heaven but you i know and your power for did you not caus
the terribl tempest to ceas last night and save us all from death
upon the rock of carmel
ay i did thi tene have strength given to me whenc it
matter not it is strang to think is it nother i bent forward
and stare him in the eyesthat on board thi ship there ar men so
cowardli and so evil that thei took counsel to cast me to the deep as
a sacrific to their god and that had thei done so though me had
thei known it thei could not harm thei themselv everi on of
them would have been that sacrific
now he writh and turn colour beneath my glanc but answer
is it so ladi name me those men and thei shall be slain
ay king tene without doubt thei shall be slain everi on of
them sinc isi doe not forget a threat of murder against her
priestess yet i name them not where is the need when alreadi those
name ar written on the tablet of heaven let them be till fate
find them sinc i would not have you in your rage stain your hand
with their vile blood but what would you with me king
you know well he answer thickli i worship you i am mad with
love of you when i saw you stand by the broken mast and make
prayer even then upon the edg of doom my heart melt for you i
sai that there is a rage fire in my breast that onli you can
quench and he made as though he would fall upon hi knee befor me
i motion to him to remain seat and answer
i rememb king that you spoke in thi same fashion befor the
storm and that half in jest i wrote certain term upon which i would
becom your queen name when you could give me rule over all the
earth wise perhap to these term you would not set your seal
inde you ask me why you should not take me to be your toi and to
that question an answer came to you last night when the ship wallow
waterlog and on her lee you saw the billow spout on the rock
of carmel also the goddess ha told me more of what would chanc to
you should you dare to lift a hand against her priestess i tell you
that it is horribl so horribl that i spare you sinc if you heard
it you would trembl what need to talk of such a crime when such a
judgment would follow hard upon it heel so have done tene and
learn that it is my pleasur to return to egypt in thi ship
nai nai he cri i cannot part with you sooner would i lose my
crown i tell you that if i lost sight of you and hope of you i
should go mad
which perchanc you mai do yet tene i repli laugh if
inde you ar not alreadi mad after the fashion of tyrant who for
the first time ar rob of that which thei desir you have my
command so have done i would speak with philo the captain as to
when he can be readi to sail for nile
hearken ladi hearken he said thickli i have the write here i
will sign it in your presenc if you swear to abid by it
is it so well tene i do not chang my word when you can crown me
queen of phoenicia egypt persia and the rest as i can show you how
to do then i will take you for husband and reign as your sole wife
but until then never shall you dare so much as to touch me now i am
weari who last night slept so ill do you wish to seal the write
for if so it shall be done befor a wit whose life and welfar
henceforth shall be as sacr to you as my own
ay ay i will seal i will seal he said
then i clap my hand and the slave who wait without appear i
bade him summon philo the captain of the ship and to bring wax
present philo came and i told him what wa need of him more
demand the papyru from tene i read it to both of them philo
listen with a stoni stare of amaz then the wax wa spread
upon the papyru and tene seal it with hi seal which wa a
cylind of lapi lazuli have imag of god upon it after the old
babylonian fashion also beneath my own he wrote hi name in
phoenician letter which i could not read then philo as wit wrote
hi for be half a greek he knew thi art and seal it with hi
seal a scarab cut in cornelian by no mean artist doubtless a
grecian which scarab he said he had taken mani year befor from
the finger of on whom he kill in battl when i look at what it
left upon the wax i laugh for behold the devic wa that of a
diana or perchanc a nymph shoot with an arrow a brutefac faun
that had surpris her at the bath to my mind the face of that faun
or satyr wa veri like to the face of tene and philo thought it also
for i saw him glanc from on to the other and heard him mutter an
omen an omen beneath hi breath in the egyptian tongu which tene
did not understand
when the roll wa sign tene would have taken it but i answer
nai on that dai when it condit ar fulfil it shall be your
but till then it is mine
still i promis to give him a copi of the write and with thi he
wa or feign to be content
when philo had gone tene ask me how he wa to becom ruler of the
world and thu to win me
i answer that i would tell him later in sidon after i had thought
and prai but on thing he must swear name to listen to no
counsel save my own sinc otherwis he might lose me and with me
all he did so by hi god be at that time so bemus that he
would have sworn anyth if therebi he might keep near to me
moreov he told me that it wa hi purpos to set me in a palac
near hi own or perchanc in a part of hi own that there he might
visit me daili and learn my counsel
i bow my head and said the more often the better so long as he
came for counsel and no more then i dismiss him and he went like
ani slave
when he had gone onc more i summon philo and under the wing of
the goddess that is under an oath of secreci to break which is
death i told him my brotherinisi the mean of thi plai
name that i would be aveng upon tene who had affront me and the
goddess who also in hi cowardic had propos to sacrific me in
the deep an offer to hi fals divin moreov i gave him
that copi of the write which i had made and hi charter be
fulfil bade him get back to egypt as soon as might be and deliv
it to noot the highpriest of isi and with it all thi stori
there at memphi i bade him bide have a great ship thi on or
anoth readi man with brave men all of them follow of isi
with whom noot would furnish him also with the monei need to hire
or bui that ship there he wa to wait till my word came how it would
come i did not know as yet perchanc thi would be by messeng or
perchanc i should talk with the spirit of noot by mean at the
command of those initi in the highest mysteri of the goddess at
least when my word came he must sail at onc and come to me at sidon
these thing he swore to do moreov i wrote a letter which
afterward i gave to him to deliv to noot
we cast anchor in the harbour hoist the royal standard of tene as
best we could on a tall pole at the prow at onc gild barg on
board of which were gener and priest put off from the quai and
watch from my cabin i saw tene talk earnestli with these notabl
who from time to time glanc toward where i wa hidden then a
messeng came to prai me to be pleas to abid on board the ship
till prepar had been made to receiv me a matter to which the
king depart to attend so i stai there and spoke with philo about
mani thing learn from him much concern the sidonian their
wealth and their strength in war
two hour later a barg arriv the royal barg i think for it wa
gloriou with silk and gold and the rower wore blazon uniform on
board thi barg wa tene himself and with him among other priest
who wore tall cap also some priestess the king came and bow
led me to a carpet ladder by which i descend into the barg as i
went down it step i said with a laugh
if some had won their wai last night o king i should have left thi
ship in a veri differ fashion well i forgiv them poor fool and
coward but whether the goddess whom i serv will forgiv them is
anoth matterword at which i saw him winc
befor i went also i step asid and again spoke to philo who stood
near the head of the ladder cap in hand that speech wa short yet
suffici be of but two word
rememb everyth
to the death child of wisdom he answer
what sai the marin ask tene suspici
naught o king that is he onli prai me to interced with the
goddess lest the fate of those who would have harm me on thi ship
should overtak him also who is it captain
again tene winc and again i smile
we were row ashor and there upon the quai wait a chariot drawn
by milkwhit hors in which chariot i wa seat splendidli
apparel men lead the hors in front of me went the king in
anoth chariot and behind follow an escort of guard
thu we proceed through the gloriou street of sidon and be
move thereto i lift my veil and stood up in the chariot as though
i would see these better alreadi the fame of my come had spread
abroad so that those street and the flat roof of the hous were
crowd with thousand of the peopl these when thei saw my beauti
gasp with wonder and cri in their own tongu
no woman no woman a goddess inde
yet i thought that i heard other answer
ay a fals goddess sent to sidon to be her ruin
true word inde though as i think inspir by hate and jealousi
rather than from on high
we came to a great and nobl squar the holi place it wa call
round which stood statu of those whom the sidonian worship
baal ashtoreth and the rest of their daemon moreov with it back
to the templ stood a huge and hideou god of brass who in front of
him upon great hand which seem to be discolour with fire held a
curv trai whereof the inner edg rest on an open in the belli
of the figur i ask of on who walk by the chariot what wa the
name of thi god he answer
dagon whom some call moloch to whom the firstborn ar sacrif by
fire see the priest ar store the hollow place beneath with wood
soon doubtless there will be a great offer
thenceforward i hate thi peopl for what could on born in arabia
and a servant of isi the holi and gentl think of a race that
offer sacrific of those born of them to a daemon ye i look on
their face keen handsom and cruel and hate them on and all
we came to the door of the palac where slave ran forward assist
me from the chariot by it stood tene surround with glitter
nobl and whiterob priest who stare at me doubtfulli
be pleas to enter my hous ladi fear noth for there you
shall be well lodg and given of the best that sidon ha to offer
said tene
i thank you i answer bow and let fall my veil and i
doubt it not for what less than her best could sidon give to the
daughter of isi the queen of heaven
ye thu i answer proudli i who plai a great game and stake all
upon a throw
here we have anoth queen of heaven and she is not name isi i
heard on of the darkbrow priest mutter to a companion think
that i did not understand hi word
thei led me into a gloriou dwell wherein were chamber more
splendid than ani that i had seen in my journei through the eastern
world gold and gem were everywher and on the wall hung priceless
trap dy with the tyrian purpl of that costli sort to us which
is the prerog of king the veri carpet on the floor shone like
silk and were woven to thing of beauti while the lamp seem to be
hollow from great gem
who lodg in thi place i ask of a slave when i wa alon
who but the queen belti divin on answer the slave bow low
befor me
where then is the queen belti i see her not
nai divin on she visit her father at jerusalem whenc she
should return shortli inde the king ha issu order that other
chamber should be prepar for her against her come
is it so i repli indiffer but within my heart i wonder
what thi queen would sai when she came to find her place inhabit by
a stranger and a rival
then to the sound of sweet music i at from servic of gold and drank
out of jewel cup and afterward be weari who had rest
littl on that ship and wa tempesttoss laid me down to sleep in a
soft and scent bed guard by women and by eunuch
easi enough thought i to myself would it be for these to murder
me on unfriend and alon in a strang land and becaus of thi
for a littl felt afraid who at that time wa but as other mortal
ar on the ship i had fear noth for there wa philo a brother
of my faith and with him some other who could be trust but here i
wa but as a lamb ring round with wolv moreov besid the
wolv there wa a lion the kingbrut tene who sought to snare me
and whom i knew for a liar not to be trust whatev he might swear
ye for a littl while perhap for the first time in my life and
certainli for the last that is where my bodi wa at stake i felt
somewhat afraid so much so that i went to a windowplac to watch the
rise of the moon and to make my prayer to isi of whom it wa the
symbol that she would be pleas to protect me in thi citi whither
by her will i had wander
thi window look out upon that flamelit squar which wa call the
holi place there i note that thousand of those of sidon were
gather some of them stare up at the palac to which it wa known
i had been taken point and talk the most of them howev
wander round the great brazen statu that hideou devilfac
thing whereof i have written and when thei could caught on of the
priest by the arm and put question to him
among these i notic were mani women some of whom from their mien
seem to be nobl whose face were strang to see defiant thei
were yet in a wai proud as might be the face of those about to do
some great deed moreov mani of these women led or carri
children which littl on thei show to the priest who smile
horribl and nod approv pat the children on the arm and even
kiss them
on ladi after her son had receiv such a kiss wail aloud and
clasp him to her breast turn and fled awai whereon the priest
curs her and the other women shout shame then strove to cover
up the miseri that peep out of their ey by sing some fierc
song in honour of their god
studi thi scene present the mean of it came home to me
those children were doom to be sacrif to the brazen dagon or
moloch whereof i rememb have heard in jerusalem as a devil to
whom the firstborn were pass through the fire ye and these the
mother had brought them there that thei might look upon the god and
grow accustom to the sight of him
oh it wa horribl and my heart chill at the thought of such
iniqu what reward from heaven i marvel for a peopl who
practis such a faith
as i marvel an answer seem to come to me the sun had sunk but
there were heavi cloud in the sky abov upon which struck it
depart rai thenc thei were reflect on to the citi and chiefli
upon thi holi place as it wa call and the brazen imag that sat
there befor the templ ye from those cloud came red light that
fill the air and the citi beneath and the holi place as it were
with a mist of blood it wa as though everyth were dy with
blood and in the midst ring round with torch glow moloch a
god of blood
then i knew that sidon wa doom to be drown in blood that such
wa the decre of heaven and that i ayesha wa the instrument
appoint to loos thi spear of death upon her beauteou sin
breast i shiver at the thought i who love not cruelti or to spend
the live of men though it wa true that i would kill tene yet what
wa i but the lightn in the hand of fate and can the lightn
choos where it will strike must it not fall whither it is drawn to
thi end had i been sent to earth name that i might bring woe upon
fals egypt and the peopl who clung to her
such wa the burden of that dream by which my sleep wa haunt such
too the command of heaven which again and again noot the prophet had
whisper in my ear i must destroi egypt or rather her apost
priest and ruler and afterward onc more build up the worship of
isi in some far land that should be reveal to me such wa my
mission whereof it wa decre that i should fulfil the first part
and becaus of my sin leav the rest undon
holli the learn tell me that the new faith he follow to which i
will not listen who am weari of religion and their chang march
toward a changeless end write it down that free will is given to
man that he is abl to choos thi path and reject the other that he
is the master of hi own soul which he can guid here or there as the
horseman guid hi steed or philo steer hi ship
and yet he read to me from the write of on of the great apostl
of that faith a certain holi on name paulu word which declar
that man is predestin er he wa born to etern life or etern
death to the glori of the light or the unfathom dark to me these
doctrin seem to war on upon the other though for aught i knew both
mai be true see that within the circl of the starri sphere and
the vast soul of that which made them there is room for a multitud
of truth whereof the shadow fall upon the gross earth take a
thousand shape of error
moreov i hold that whatev is is true becaus it is and that men
do but tangl themselv in seem differ that ar onli vari
light dart from the etern ey of truth on all heart shine
those ey but none behold them as hi brother doe for to each
thei burn as a separ torch of differentcolour flame therefor
it is that men worship mani god not know that these ar the same
god whose hand hold all thing
thu i sum up the matter at least through the million of the ag
and the multitud of live man mai attain to freedom if hi face be
set that wai of hi own desir yet in hi littl hour on the earth
that fals he believ hi all look from birth to death and the
black that bound them both he is not free but a part of
strength that ar greater than hi own have i ayesha been free i
who chose the holi path and fell from it into natur gulf did i
desir to fall did i not desir to climb that steep road to the
height of heaven and sit enthron upon the topmost snow of puriti
and peac and yet anoth might hurl me thenc and now it is my
fate to climb again by slow and pain step to climb etern
but of these thing i will speak in their season tell what is the
price those pai who seek to overleap the bound that hem us in and to
match their petti against divin decre
these in the midst of the red light that fill sidon like a bowl with
blood and shone on me and all on me the priestess on the brazen
dagon tower up against me on fantast lamplit templ and
palac on the great place about which thei stood and the fierc
face multitud that wander on it marbl pavement there in the
windowopen i knelt me down and prai lift my face to the pure
heaven abov to isi did i prai as an idolat prai to an imag in
a cave becaus isi wa my symbol or rather to that which is as far
abov isi as isi wa abov me for i prai to the soul of that
univers whereof my ey could see a part in the arch ski and of
thi soul what wa isi but on golden thread in a glitter garment
that wrap the majesti of god and what then wa i and what were those
fiercefac worshipp of dagon
oh in that hour of dedic for such i felt it to be these truth
came home to my heart as never thei had done befor and thi wa the
sum of them that i and all i could see and know were but as
impalp grain of dust not suffici to caus the delic hung
balanc wherein the wil of the world is pois against the
decre of the immort law to vari by a hair breadth still i
prai and becaus that which is small yet contain that which is
smaller and the smaller find a god in the small as the small doe
in the great from that prayer i won comfort
my prayer finish i laid me down to rest in the golden bed of belti
the queen into whose place i had been thrust bethink me how mani
and near were the danger by which i wa surround that brute king
desir me for a prei and here in hi palac i lai in the hollow of
hi hand he had the kei to all my door the servant who stood about
them were hi creatur whom at a nod he could send to death i wa a
stranger in a strang land utterli unfriend for philo wa far off
upon hi ship there wa noth between me and him save the
impalp veil of fear which i had woven between us by the strength
of my spirit i wa a prize to be taken unarmour without javelin
or arrow to protect me with noth noth save that veil of fear
if he chose to break through it dare my curs and that of my
goddess he could do so then the curs would fall inde but it
would be too late to save me and i the proud and pure must pass
henc defil as pass i would still trust to the goddess or
rather to the part of her which dwelt in me or to that which wa
abov us both i laid me down and slept
at midnight i awok the light of the moon flow through the window
place flood the splendid chamber catch on the cornic of gold
the polish mirror and the silver vessel the door open and
through it wrap in a dark cloak came tene though hi face wa
hidden i knew him by hi heavi shape and shambl step he crept
toward me like a wolf upon a sleep lamb there i lai in the golden
bed illumin by the moon and watch through the web of my
outstretch hair my hand upon the dagger that wa buckl to my
girdl he drew near he bent over me breath heavili and hi ey
devour my beauti still i feign sleep and watch him while my
finger close upon the handl of the dagger he unbuckl hi cloak
reveal hi hooknos visag and a draught of wind seem to catch
it for it flap and fell from hi shoulder though i felt no wind
he stoop as though to lift it and it would seem came face to face
with i know not what perchanc it wa the goddess invis to me
perchanc it wa some pictur of hi own death to come i cannot sai
at least hi shift ey sank in till thei seem to vanish beneath
the hairi brow and hi fat cheek grew pallid as though the blood
were drain from them by a mortal wound word came hiss from hi
thick lip and thei were
horribl horribl she is inde divin for god and ghost protect
her horribl death walk the air
then he reel from the room drag the cloak after him and know
that i had no more to fear i return thank to the guardian spirit
and slept sweetli the danger that i dread had drawn near and pass
to return no more
chapter ix
dagon take hi sacrific

aros and wa led to the bath by slave then those slave cloth me
in the silk of cypru over which i threw a new veil border with
the purpl of tyre more thei brought me gift from the king
priceless jewel pearl with rubi and sapphir set in gold those

water drunk from a crystal cup when a eunuch came sai the king
tene crave audienc of me
let him enter i answer
present he stood befor me make salut and ask me with
feign careless whether i had rest well
ay great king i answer well enough save for a singl veri
vivid dream i dream that set the god of evil rose out of the
dark of hell wear the shape of a man whose face i could not
see and that thi fiend would have seiz me and drag me down into
the pit of hell i wa afraid and while i lai as on in a net there
came to me a vision of the divin isi who said
where is thy faith daughter if i save thee on the ship give
thee the live of all her compani cannot i save thee now and alwai
fiend shall not harm thee nor men sword shall not pierc thee nor
fire burn and if ani would lai hand on thee on them i give thee
power to call down my vengeanc and to cast them to the jaw of the
devour who await evildo watch ever in the black depth of
death
then in my dream the mother whisper into the ear of that fiend
shape like a man and pass her hand befor hi ey show him
certain vision though what these were i know not at the least thei
caus him to wail aloud with terror also to my sight to fall as from
a precipic and like some foul vultur pierc by an archer shaft
go whirl down down and down into gulf that had no bottom it
wa a veri evil dream king tene and yet sweet becaus it told me
that though i should journei to the end of the earth still i shall
not pass out of the shelter of the circl arm of isi
evil inde ladi he said hoars bite hi lip to still the
quaver in hi voic yet it end well so what of dream
veri well o kingfor me and as for dream i who by gift and
train am skill in their interpret hold that for the most
part thei ar a shadow of the truth i know that certainli no harm can
come to me in your palac over which on dai i must rule or in your
citi where i am a guest yet doubtless some peril of the spirit did
threaten me last night and by the help of heaven wa brought to
noth
doubtless doubtless though of such matter i know noth who
deal with the thing of earth not with those of heaven but ladi i
came to tell you that thi dai there is a great sacrific on the holi
place yonder and that from these window you will be abl to watch it
well it is to propiti our god that thei mai well give us victori
in the war against the persian
is it so king but where ar the victim i see no kine nor sheep
nor dove such as ar offer in rome and in jerusalem or even
flower and fruit such as in egypt we lai upon our gentler altar
nai ladi here we make more costli offer tith our own blood
ye here moloch claim the fruit of our bodi take them to hi
purifi fire so that their innoc breath mai rise as a sweet
savour to the nostril of the devour and protect god

of israel and is absent on a journei therefor i know not and when

how can i ladi must not the king bear that yoke which is laid upon
the neck of hi peopl if i spare him would not the mother of
sidon whose young have pass into the fire spit at me and curs me
ay and tear me to piec if thei might nai he must die with the
rest the priest have so decre
on your head be it king i said and choke in my loath of him
then a thought took me and i cri to those who were gather about
the door of the chamber captain of the guard eunuch slave
scribe and a priest or two

egypt is name oracleofisi
thei came drawn by wonder or perchanc becaus my strength compel

must visit her dominion king and give thank to the goddess for her
advanc do you understand

would i had never set ey on you and your accurs beauti he
answer in a rage

begin make me wonder what you will wish in the end why not take
your ey off me and have done king tene
becaus i cannot becaus i am bewitch he answer furious and
rise left me while i laugh and laugh
he depart and i went to the windowplac to breath air free from
the poison of hi presenc there i saw that the holi place beneath
wa alreadi fill with ten of thousand of the sidonian i saw
moreov that priest were engag in light fire at the foot of
the great brazen imag of dagon which fire seem to burn within the
imag sinc smoke pour out far abov from an open in hi head
moreov by degre the copper plate of which it vast and hideou
bulk wa built up grew red with heat so that the upper part of it
becam on glow furnac
whiterob priest gather in troop began to offer prayer and

catch the blood that fell from them in shallow shell of the sea
cast it into the fire orat made speech prophet utter
propheci band of fair women appear nake to the middl and
have their breast gild who danc wildli befor the god
then suddenli there wa a great silenc and from the mouth of some
gatewai that i could not see becaus it lai almost beneath the
balconi of the palac appear the king tene clad in gorgeou
sacerdot robe those i think of the highpriest of baal with him

great god that dagon mai be propiti and sidon mai conquer in thi
war o dagon take my son that hi spirit mai pass through the flame
and be gather to thy spirit and that thine appetit mai feed upon

at these word a great and joyou shout went up from the ten of
thousand of peopl and in the midst of the shout tene bent down and
kiss hi son which wa the onli kindli human thing that ever i saw
him do the child affright clung to hi robe but the woman at
hi side snatch the boi awai and ran with him struggl to a
priest who stood by the foot of a littl iron ladder of which the top
rest against the outstretch giant hand of the glow imag
the priest took the child from the woman hold him aloft that the
multitud might see him and know him for the veri son of the king oh
never shall i forget the look upon that child face as he wa thu
held aloft in the hand of the brutal priest who stood upon the lower
rung of the ladder he had ceas to scream but hi ruddi cheek
were blanch hi black ey seem to start from hi head and hi
littl hand grasp emptili at the air or were lift up to heaven
which inde wa near to him as though in supplic for
deliver from the cruelti of man
the priest climb the ladder bear the child and i note a kind
of metal cover upon hi breast and head set there to shield him
from the heat of the fieri idol
he reach the platform of the outstretch hand the child finger
clung to hi garment but he tore them free and with a cry of triumph
let fall the littl bodi into the hollow of the hot hand then to
drown the victim cri priest stand below began to plai upon
instrument of music as thei plai sing some hymn to the god i
saw the littl arm toss aloft abov the edg of the hollow of the
brazen hand then i saw those arm lift themselv feebli for the
last time and that poor tortur innoc babe roll slowli into
the red abyss beneath while the savag multitud scream it delight
to heaven
thi royal sacrific wa accomplish yet it wa but the first of
mani for woman after woman brought her child or sometim it wa a
man who brought it and babe after babe wa thrown upon the redhot
hand and roll thenc into the flame beneath all the while the
priest plai upon their instrument and sang their song while the
shameless priestess and other those with the gild breast
danc lewdli toss up their white arm and the thousand of the
peopl of sidon fill with the lust of blood roar aloud in their
drunken joi and the poor mother now that the deed wa done crept
thenc laugh and cry both togeth back to their desol
home there to stare at the cot empti into the bosom of the god
at length i could bear no more of thi scene of hell and depart to
my sleepingchamb caus women to draw curtain over the window
place and have dismiss them sat myself down and thought
a great rage fill me ayesha who have ever love childrenwil a
dai come when i shall nurs on upon my breast i wonder and if so in
what star will it be bornand a mighti hate of those accurs
sidonian all piti left my heart even for the young who would grow
up to be as were those who begat them these shark and tiger love
blood good thei should be fill with blood their own blood all of
them were guilti all all were murder hearken to their horribl
rejoic old men and maiden young men and matron the toothless
crone and the bud girl the great lord and ladi the toiler on
the deep and the trader of the citi the bond and the free from the
king down to the meanest slave all of them scream with hideou
rejoic as babe after babe wa swallow by the glow gorg of the
daemon thei name a god therefor i vow by isi that all of them
should pai the price of thi innoc blood and go down to find their
god in hell ye i swore it by the mother and by my own outrag
soul
the next dai belti came the king tene wa in my outer chamber
fawn on me and watch me out of hi crafti ey as i saw through
the veil that i had let fall over my face and my flesh crept at the
sight of him train though i wa and wise though i wa who knew
well that the hour had not come to strike scarc could i bear him
near me who long to drive my dagger through hi ly throat yet i
sat still and listen to hi flatteri and answer him with doubl
edg and mock word of which he could not read the mean he
told me that alreadi the great sacrific had born good fruit sinc
tide had come of a new victori over the vanguard of the persian
in which five thousand of the men of ochu had perish
i answer that i doubt not it would bear yet better fruit then
ask him how mani of hi folk dwelt in sidon
he answer some sixti thousand
then o king i said i who am fill with the spirit of the
mother make a propheci to you i prophesi that in reward of the pieti
of thi peopl of your who do not grudg their own children to the
god the god will take sixti thousand live from among the wick of
the earth who worship firea i am told these persian do
that is a good sai ladi he said rub hi fat hand though
it is true that some might sai that we sidonian also worship fire or
rather moloch whose belli is fill with flame as we saw yesterdai
now while we were speak and thi brute bemus wa talk thu
almost at hazard for hi mind wa set on me onli i note that those
who attend him slip from the place take with them the wait
women and close the carven door behind them so that he and i were
now alon guess that thi wa done by order i knew that i must
prepar for some outburst of the man passion and took counsel with
myself what it wa doe not matter becaus of that which follow
alreadi he had begun for the word o most beauteou had pass
hi lip when the door burst open and through it came a noblelook
woman she wa tall dark and handsom with swiftglanc tragic
ey as i knew at onc a jewess sinc i had seen other like her in
jerusalem she glanc at me as though wonder what my veil hid and
advanc stood befor tene he had not heard her come or seen her
hi mind be full of other matter and hi back toward the doorwai
at the sound of her feet he turn and come face to face with her
step backward three pace with a frighten face and utter some
phoenician curs
have you return so soon belti he ask what ha brought you
here befor the appoint time
my heart o tene king and husband yonder in jerusalem a prophet of
jehovah said word to me that caus me to return and swiftli tell

through those where he should be and found him not all i found wa
hi nurs weep ay so choke with tear that she could not answer
my question where is our son tene
now he cast hi ey about him like on who find himself in a snare
and answer thickli
ala ladi the god have taken our son
she gasp and clasp her hand upon her heart sai or rather
moan
how did thei take him husband
he look through the windowplac at the hideou brazen imag dull
with heat and blacken by smoke he look at the ladi with the white
face and the terribl ey then he strove to speak but as it seem
could not for the mumbl word choke each other in hi throat
answer she said coldli but he could not or would not answer
then my spirit move me i plai a part in thi ineff tragedi
ye i ayesha threw back my veil sai

of dagon onli then from those empti ey came flame also i saw king
tene lead out a beauteou blackei boi of three summer or so
which boi he declar to be hi son thi boi he gave to a woman
although the child clung wail to hi robe the woman gave him to a
priest the priest climb a ladderlook there it standsand laid
him upon the redhot hand of the idol whenc he roll amidst the
plaudit of the peopl into a womb of fire to be perchanc reborn in
heaven
belti heard and as she heard her face seem to freez into a mask of
ic then she stare at tene and ask almost in a whisper
ar these thing so o dog of a sidonian that like a dog can devour
your own flesh

the god claim that victori mai crown our arm who can deni the god
rejoic o mother that he ha been pleas to accept that which wa

chapter x
the vengeanc of belti
so it came about that thi queen whose name i learn wa elisheba
among her own peopl the hebrew belti be a titl given to her
in sidon and i dwelt togeth in the palac of tene leav me she
dare not nor would i suffer it who knew that then certainli she
would be murder while with me she wa safe becaus tene dare not
touch on whom i shelter be afraid of me on moreov over
whom i had place the veil of isi for the rest she wa glad to stai
with me whom soon she learn to love especi after she had
learn how i plead for her son life
i too wa glad that she should do so both becaus she wa a
companion to my loneli and a protect sinc tene could not
persecut me with hi passion in her presenc and becaus she had
those who love her in sidon certain hebrew through whom we learn
much yet we were in a strang case the queen who reign and the
queen to whom her place wa promis dwell togeth like sister
and both sworn to destroi him who wa her husband and who desir to
be mine
for we made a pact togeth she swear by jehovah and i by isi
that we would neither rest nor stai till we saw tene dead and hi
sidonian with him oh if i hate him and these she the rob
mother hate them wors so deepli inde that if onli she might come
by vengeanc she care noth for her life she wa a fiercenatur
woman such as those of the hebrew often ar and all her heart
love had been given to thi boi her onli child whom tene butcher
at the bid of the priest and becaus of hi superstit
from the begin thi belti or elisheba had hate the sidonian and
tene to whom she wa given in a marriag of polici by the ruler of
jerusalem becaus of her beauti and her royal blood and now to her
thei were but as wild beast and snake to be destroi yet she wa
clever also and plai her part well feign sorrow for the wild
word she spoke in the hour of her agoni and with it obedi to the
wish of the king she even told him in my presenc that when the
time came she would be will that i should take her crown and she
but a second place or if it pleas him better that she would return
to her own peopl thi howev he did not desir sinc he fear
lest the disgrac of so great a ladi should bring the wrath of
jerusalem upon him or even caus the hebrew to join hi enemi
so well did she plai that part inde make it appear that her
spirit wa crush and that she wa on from whom there wa noth to
fear that soon tene came to believ that thi wa so and in order
to pleas me he suffer her to dwell on there in peac
now i have to tell of the war and of the end of sidon first i should
sai howev that befor he sail for egypt after the hapi had
been fit with a new mast of cedar i caus philo to be summon to
the palac by the help of those jew who were the friend of belti
he wa brought to my presenc with two merchant disguis as on of
their compani and while belti made pretenc to chaffer with them
for their costli good i spoke with him apart
i told him to get him to memphi as quickli as he might and there
make all readi as we had agre await my messag how thi would
reach him or noot or both of them i did not know it might be by
write or by messeng who would bear certain token or it might be
otherwis at least when it came he must sail at onc and arriv
off the port of sidon everi night after the set of the sun and
befor it rise must light a flare of green fire at hi masthead
caus it to burn for the fourth part of an hour so that i might be
sure that the ship which signal led wa hi and no other then in thi
wai or in that i would find mean to come aboard that vessel and the
rest wa in the hand of the god
these thing he vow to do and depart safe with the merchant
nor did tene ever learn that philo had visit the palac
meanwhil tene wa make mighti prepar for the war he dug a
tripl ditch about sidon and heighten it wall he hire ten
thousand grecian mercenari and arm the citizen by help of the
greek he drove the persian vanguard out of phoenicia and for a while
all went well for him and egypt at length came the new that the vast
armi of ochu wa roll down on sidon togeth with three hundr
trirem and five hundr transport such an armi as phoenicia had
never seen
on morn tene came to my chamber and told of the march of ochu
belti withdraw herself he wa in a veri evil case for he
trembl and even forgot to sai sweet word or to devour me with hi
ey after hi fashion i ask him why hi hand shook and hi lip
were pale he who as a warrior king should be rejoic at the
prospect of battl he answer becaus of a dream he had dream in
which he seem to see himself defeat by the persian and cast down
live from the wall of the citi then he ad these word
you ladi promis to show me how to conquer the world do so i
prai you for i sai that my heart is afraid and i know not how i shall
stand against ochu
now i laugh at him and answer
so at last you come to me for counsel tene who for dai have been
wonder for how long you would be content to take that of mentor of
rhode and of the king of cypru well what would you learn
i would learn how i mai defeat the persian ladi the persian who
pour upon us like a flood through a broken wall
i do not know tene to me it seem imposs i think that dream
of your is come true tene that is and i ceas
what then must i do ladi what is your mean
i mean that you ar mad to fight ochu
but i am fight ochu
those who have been enemi mai becom friend king tene have i
not told you that you would be safer as the alli of ochu than as hi
foe what is egypt to you that you should destroi yourself to save
nectaneb
egypt mai be littl ladi but sidon is much the sidonian ar
pledg to thi war and the hand of ochu might be heavi on them
again i laugh and answer
which is dearer to a man hi own life or those of other fight and
die if you will o king or make peac and perchanc let other die if
you will o king thei sai that ochu is gener and know how to
reward those who serv him
do you mean that i should make a pact with him and betrai my peopl
he ask hoars
ay my word mai be so read hearken you have great ambit you
would win the worldand me my wisdom tell me that onli thu can you
win the worldand me continu thi war and veri soon you will lose
me and all that you command of earth shall be such small part of it as
hide your bone now make your choic and troubl me no more who in
truth find littl joi in timid heart that fear to take hold of
opportun therefor follow your counsel or my own i care not
which who would be gone back to egypt to seek a higher destini than
that of consort to a conquer slave
whatev i mai lose you i cannot lose he said slowli also your
mind is mine thi persian is too strong for me and on egypt i cannot
lean too hard lest it break beneath me these sidonian also ar
rebelli and murmur against me i think that thei would kill me if
thei dare who now call me childmurder becaus i gave my son in
sacrific to pleas the priest
mayhap king i answer carelessli sinc mob ar fickl i
repeat that the wise man and he who would be great doe not think of
other but of himself
i will consult with my gener mentor the greek for he is far
sight he said and left me
the poison work i thought to myself as i watch him go then i
call belti and told her all that had pass between her lord and
me she listen and ask
why do you lead tene down thi road ayesha
becaus of the pit at the end of it i answer have not your
spi told us that thi ochu is implac he will make a pact with
tene and then he will destroi him such at least is the counsel that
come to me from heaven which he ha anger as i think
then i prai that tene mai follow it ayesha so long as it hurl him
down to hell and the sidonian with him
as it chanc he did for it wa of a sort that hi fals heart love
the rest mai be told in few word tene sent hi minist
thessalion anoth crafti fellow to make a treati with ochu these
were the term of thi treati that he tene should surrend sidon
and in payment receiv the royalti of egypt after it had been
conquer and of all phoenicia also and with it that of cypru ochu
swore these gift to him and continu hi advanc when he reach a
certain spot he halt then tene as he had undertaken to do led
out a hundr of the chief citizen of sidon to a council of the
state of phoenicia or so he said
howbeit present thei found themselv in the camp of ochu who
butcher them to the last man all save tene himself who return
to sidon with a tale of an ambush from which he had escap
then it wa i saw that the end drew near and in a ship which not
tene but the captain of the sidonian sent to nectaneb at memphi
to prai for more aid i caus a faith jew to sail on sworn to
the servic of belti who carri with him hidden in the hollow sole
of hi sandal a letter address to noot and to philo prai that
philo would sail at onc and do all those thing that had been agre
upon between us also night by night i sent out my spirit or rather
my thought to seek the spirit of noot as he had taught me to do and
it seem to me that answer came from noot tell me that he read my
thought and would do those thing which i desir
the chief men of the sidonian held a council in the great hall of the
palac hidden behind curtain in a galleri of the hall belti and i
saw and heard all that pass at thi council over which tene
presid as king bitter wa the talk of those lord for doubt were
abroad thei thought it veri strang that tene alon should have
escap from that ambush yet like the liar that he wa he cozen
them with fals tale show them also that the god of the
sidonian had preserv hi life that he in hi turn might preserv
their ye he said thi and other thing he the knave and traitor
who alreadi plot to destroi them all
at thi council the sidonian took a desper road dai by dai mani
were escap from the citi by sea and otherwis alreadi nigh a third
of the peopl had gone and among them some thousand of the best
soldier so that the captain saw that soon the great citi would be
left with few to defend her therefor thei came to thi resolveto
burn all their ship so that no more could flee upon them and to set
watch at the gate and round the wall with order to slai ani who
might attempt flight by land
fear for hi life tene consent to these deed swear that he
desir but on thing to conquer or to die with the citizen of
sidon
so it came about that soon the dark wa made as light as dai by
the flame which sprang from over a hundr vessel of war besid a
multitud of smaller ship while the sidonian watch them burn
from the roof of their hous beat their breast and moan for now
thei knew thei were cut off and must conquer or perish
the ship of ochu watch the port of sidon though somewhat
carelessli becaus it wa known to him that it harbour were empti
and the vast armi of ochu roll down in countless host upon it
wall
hour by hour spi came in with terribl report caus the heart
of the sidonian to melt with fear for now thei understood that all
hope of victori wa gone and that thei were doom though as yet thei
did not know that it wa their king who had betrai them
anoth council wa held at which belti and i watch as befor and
there it wa agre that the citi should throw itself upon the merci
of ochu tene affect to protest and at last to allow himself to be
overrul as i to whom he came dai by dai for guidanc put it into
hi black heart to do herald were sent to the camp of ochu
offer to surrend upon honour term and while thei were
absent bloodi sacrific of children and other were made to dagon and
hi compani in the holi place befor the templ till it pavement
ran red with blood for thu these cruel folk hope to propiti
heaven and to win merci from ochu
the herald return bear the word of ochu he said that if five
hundr of the chief citizen came out unarm and made submiss to
him he would grant their prayer and spare sidon but if thei did not
that he would pull it stone from stone and slaughter all who live
within it wall also on of the persian ambassador who accompani
them brought a secret letter for tene thi letter tene who by now
did noth without my counsel read to me
it wa brief thi wa it substanc
if he would put sidon into hi hand ochu swore to tene by hi most
solemn persian oath advanc greater than he had ever dream and
to mentor the rhodian and the gener of the grecian and egyptian
mercenari he swore a vast sum in gold and on of the first command
in the persian armi if tene would not do thi then ochu propos
to make peac with sidon for a while but afterward to destroi it to
tene himself howev he promis death at the hand of the
sidonian themselv to whom all hi treacheri should be reveal
lastli an answer wa demand without delai
what shall i sai to ochu ladi ask tene of me
i know not i answer honour would seem to demand that you should
lai down your life and save sidon and her citizen if onli for a
while yet o king what is honour how will honour help you when you
have been torn to piec by the madden mob upon yonder holi place
and your spirit ha gone to baal or wherev the spirit of those
sacrif to moloch mai go will thi empti honour give you that
great advanc of which the persian speak which doubtless will
carri with it the rule of phoenicia and of egypt and perchanc also
that of the east for ochu be mortal tene onc you have brought
him to hi death as i can show you how to do who is fitter than
yourself to fill hi throne lastli will death with honour bring me
whom you desir to your side king tene i have spoken now judg
and lift my veil i sat and smile at him
it is not safe he said all hang on mentor and the greek unless
thei join in the plot the sidonian will fight to the last with their
aid and when thei discov my traffic with ochu thei will slai me
and if i fly to ochu and the sidonian fight then mayhap he will
slai me as on who ha help him noth but if mentor join us
then we can open the gate to the persian and ourselv go out safe
to reap our reward
there speak a great man i said on who is foresight on not
ti by petti scrupl there speak such a on as i would take to be
my lord ay there speak a man fit to rule the world to whom the
great advanc the persian promis is but the first rung in the
ladder of gloriou triumphthat ladder which reach to the veri
star alreadi these sidonian hate you tene i saw them mutter when
you pass among them yesterdai ay and on laid hi hand upon hi
dagger but anoth check him have a look in hi ey that seem
to saynot yet if onc thei learn the truth tene perchanc soon
you also will lie on the altar of sacrific and be cast live into
the fieri jaw of dagon where your son went befor you tene why do
you not send for mentor and search hi mind
so mentor wa sent for and meanwhil i gave tene my hand to kiss
ye i even suffer thi that i might fix him the more firmli on my
hook
mentor came he wa a burli greek a great soldier with a keen brain
behind hi laugh ey on who love gold and wine and women and
for these and high place and generalship wa readi to sell hi sword
to whoever bid the most
tene set out the matter to him veri craftili and show him the
write of ochu he listen then ask
and what doe thi veil daughter of isi think i rememb hear
in egypt where she wa held the first of oracl and name child of
wisdom that her propheci never fail to fulfil themselv
the daughter of isi think that among the persian mentor will grow
tall but that here among the sidonian he will be fell like a
forest tree and go to feed a mighti fire such a fire as consum the
fleet of sidon awhil ago
thu i answer and when mentor heard my word he laugh and said
that he wa of the same mind which without doubt wa true for
afterward i learn that he had alreadi been in treati with ochu
so he and tene struck hand upon their bargain the most infam
perhap that wa ever made by men sinc it gave to slaughter forti
thousand or more who trust to them
thu wa sign the doom of an accurs peopl that doom which i wa
destin to bring upon their head and thu wa tene sent down the
road to hell onli mentor prosper greatli for a while in the servic
of the persian and what wa the end of him i do not know after all
he wa but on of mani who flit from master to master as advantag
lead them doubtless long ago the world ha forgotten him hi
grecian cun hi generalship and hi treacheri
the five hundr went out to the persian camp to plead with ochu
bear palm branch in their hand yea thei went with light
heart for tene had told them that certainli their prayer would be
grant and that he knew thi from the lip of ochu himself led by
the priesthood of the variou godsoh how it rejoic me to see
those vile and cruel priest in that companythei went but not on
of them return again for ochu receiv them with mockeri and
revil and to make sport for himself and hi soldier told them to
run back to sidon then he loos hi horsemen on them and slew them
with sword and javelin and set their head on stake around the
wall
when the sidonian knew and saw thei went mad with rage and terror
thei gather themselv by thousand in the holi place and had it
not been for mentor and hi greek would have storm the palac for
now thei were sure that tene had betrai them inde belti had
made the truth of thi treacheri known through the hebrew who serv
her also thei clamour that i ayesha should be led forth and
sacrif sai that it wa the presenc of a priestess of isi in
the citi which had caus their god to desert them for a littl
while i wa afraid who rememb what had chanc upon the ship
hapi when tene would have suffer me to be thrown to the deep to
satisfi the superstit of the sailor therefor think it best to
be bold i sent for tene and said to him
if by evil chanc i should be slain o king then know that i have it
from the goddess whom i serv that you with whose lot mine is
intertwin will die within an hour i tene am the bright star of
your fortun and if i set farewel to them and you
i know it he answer as i know that without you i can never rise
to be king of the world therefor i will defend you to the last
also beauteou on i desir you for my wife yet he ad some
might think that thi star of your wisdom ha hitherto led my feet
into dark and evil place and he look at me doubtfulli
fear noth i answer ti ever darkest befor the dawn and out
of evil aris good great glori await you tene or rather great
glori await both of us histori will embalm your name tene but to
myself i thought that it wa the persian who would embalm hi bodi
unless inde thei cast it to the dog
now everi even after sundown it wa my custom to walk upon the flat
roof of the palac and look out over the ocean which also for reason
of my own rise earli i did befor the dawn that night while i
walk i put up my prayer to heaven for though i plai so bold a
game it odd seem to be gather against me doubtless as it
deserv thi hate sidon would fall but when it wall were
crash down with what should i protect my head i did not know yet
it is true that never did i lose faith alwai i knew that i wa the
instrument of that strength which direct the fate of men and nation
that what i did wa becaus i wa driven and command so to do for
reason that were dark to me moreov that i wa not an instrument
to be broken and thrown asid nai howev strait the path and
howev great the peril that beset it i wa sure that i should walk
it with safeti becaus it wa fate that i should do so though
whither it would lead me i could not tell in those dai when i wa but
as other women ar still i put up my prayer to heaven and scan the
horizon with my ey
lo far awai beyond the light of the watch trirem of ochu so
far that it seem almost set upon the surfac of the sea burn a
faint green fire for the fourth part of an hour it burn and went
out then i knew that my word had reach egypt whether in the
write or by the swift path of the spirit and that noot or philo had
come to save me
befor the dawn onc more i climb to the roof of the palac and
behold far awai again the green fire burn upon the bosom of the
deep tell me that out yonder the great trirem wait for my
come ay but how wa i to come
tene the vile and mentor the venal plai their part well thei
open the gate of the outmost wall which the greek held and let in
the persian whom these greek greet as brother have at time
serv under them in the past the sidonian saw and knew that the
dice had fallen against them knew too that thei were load dice
thei gather in the holi place and rave for the blood of tene who
cower behind a curtain and hearken to them belti and i plai
our part came to comfort him
be brave i said gentli the road to the kingship of the world is
steep and difficult yet when the peak is gain how gloriou o
conqueror will be the prospect spread out befor your ey
it is steep and difficult he mutter wipe hi brow with the
fring of hi broider robe
had he been seen the look which belti cast upon him stand behind
him with fold arm and humbl air perchanc he would have thought
it steeper still
let us talk i said for the end draw near what is your plan how
will you and we your queen escap from thi citi
all is prepar he answer at the king wharf to which a
cover wai run from the palac in the hous where the royal boat
ar moor is my own barg that be thu secur escap burn
with the ship in thi barg which is man with greek to whom a
great reward is promis and who wait in the boathous dai and night
we will row from the harbour for a hidden land and be escort thenc
to the encamp of the great king yet perchanc it mai be wiser
that i should be with mentor to welcom ochu when he enter to take
peac possess of the citi if so daughter of isi you will do
well to leav it by yourself or with the ladi belti if she wish to
accompani you and to meet me in the camp of ochu
perhap that would be better i answer sinc it might not be
thought seemli that the great king tene should slip awai to hi alli
by night nai let him rather march out as a monarch should onli then
we must have author to act as occas mai direct
ay ladi take thi ring and slip the royal signet from hi
finger he gave it to me it will be obei by all who see it
moreov i will issu certain order so long as we meet again at
last we whose fate ar intertwin it matter not by what separ
road we travel
it matter not at all my lord tene i answer as swiftli as i hid
awai the signet
it wa just then at the hour of sunset that mentor enter the
chamber no longer wa he gai and lightheart inde hi brow were
bent and hi ey full of troubl
by zeu he said a dread thing ha happen in their despair
these sidonian of your king tene have taken counsel togeth
thei have determin that rather than fall into the hand of ochu
thei will burn the citi and with it themselv and their wive and
children ye utter the curs of all the god upon you thu thei
have determin look the fire begin
we went to the windowplac and gaze from them saw desper men
rush to and fro with light torch of cedar wood in their hand
while other men drove mob of scream women and children into the
hous ye and into the templ and shut the door upon them here
and there too from the roof of these hous rose wisp of smoke
that soon were mingl with flame east and west and north and south
through the great citi of sidon aros that smoke and flame everywher
also mob of the peopl whose courag fail them and who did not
desir to die thu were rush toward the gate and into the camp of
the greek in thi fashion i believ that from ten to twenti
thousand of the inhabit of sidon escap though afterward ochu
the cruel slew mani of them and enslav the rest
i look i saw and my heart melt within me hate as were these
insol bloodstain folk i griev that i should have had ani hand
in bring their reward upon them after all thei were brave and
would have fought to the end who now made expiat by a great self
sacrific which wa also brave oh if i could i would have lift
that doom from off them then i rememb that it wa not i who did
these thing but fate which made of me it instrument rememb
also that onli thu could i escap the foul hand of tene
i turn to look upon that traitor he trembl and trembl tri
to seem brave he laugh and in the midst of hi laughter burst into
tear

and tie it to the masthead of hi ship that when present he sail
for egypt it mai be a warn to nectaneb the pharaoh whom also you

chapter xi
the escap from sidon
all wa over and done within that royal chamber wa silenc though
without the flame roar and the cri of the sidonian went up to
heaven i ayesha and belti the queen face each other in the gloom
and between us lai the bodi of tene on whose white distort face
flicker the light of the fire that burn without
what now queen i said

seem to have left her why cheat hi jaw of their richest morsel
i have still work to do my hour ha not yet come queen
ay i forgot follow me daughter of isi belti doe not forsak
those who have serv her look your last upon thi carrion that hope
to call you wife and follow me
as we pass from that chamber i glanc through the window and saw
that although dark now had fallen the holi place beneath wa
bright as noon with the flame of the burn templ and that in them
the vast graven imag of moloch glow as it had done upon the dai of
sacrific when the child of belti wa swallow in it redhot jaw
there it sat hideou grin as though in unholi triumph over thi
greatest of all sacrific
then suddenli a pinnacl from the templ fell upon it grind it to
powder thi wa the end of moloch sinc although sidon as i have
learn wa rebuilt in the after year never more wa sacrific made
to that devil within it wall thi at least i ayesha brought to
passth end of the worship of moloch at sidon
we pass through my sleepingchamb and as we went i seiz the
cabinet of priceless gem that tene from time to time had heap upon
me sinc these were sworn to isi and no goddess love to be rob
of her offer at the back of the chamber wa a passag lead to
a door by which a light lamp had been set in readi at thi door
stood a man whom i knew for on of the jewish servant sworn to the
servic of belti
you ar late royal ladi he exclaim so late that i wa about to
flee for look the palac burn beneath us and he point to littl
wreath of smoke that forc themselv up between the board of the
floor of the bedchamb that we had pass
late but not too late she answer the king detain us and ha
gone anoth wai you have hi order and here is hi ring and she
point to the royal signet upon my hand obei it and lead on
the man held up the lantern and glanc at the ring then he bow and
beckon to us to follow him
we went down passag long passag with mani turn and at length
came to anoth door which he open with a kei pass it we found
ourselv in a vault place beneath which wa water where float
the royal barg the same in which i had been row to the shore of
sidon oarsmen sat wait within thi barg and guard it were two
grecian soldier who command us to halt
thi boat await king tene said on of them and none els mai
enter it
i am the queen answer belti
with whom i hear the king ha quarrel broke in the greek with a
sneer queen or no ladi you cannot enter that boat without the
king or an order under hi signet
then i held up my hand sai
here is the signet itself let us pass
he stare at it by the light of the lamp then said someth to the
other greek and veri doubtfulli thei obei it wa certain that these
guard stand in that vault place did not know what wa pass in
the citi moreov i think it had come into their mind to rob us or
wors at the least thi is sure that unless we could have kill
those two greek without the signet never should have we have won to
the boat
we went on twelv pace or so and reach the barg which wa man
with sailor who wore the uniform of the king bodyguard men who
knew the queen and salut her by rais their oar belti motion
first to me and afterward to the jew who had been our guid from the
palac to enter the barg then suddenli she said to the steersman
who command the sailor
go now whither thi ladi shall direct you and know that if harm
come to her your live shall pai the price of it for she is no
woman but a goddess whom death obei
now i stare at her and ask
do you not come also queen belti
nai she whisper i choos anoth road to safeti fear not for
me i will tell you all when we meet again for a while farewel
child of wisdom and my friend mai the god with whom you commun be
your shield upon earth and receiv you when you leav the earth you
who strove to save a certain on and cast your mantl over belti when
a sword that now is set in anoth heart wa at her own give wai
sailor she cri and if you would look onc more upon the sun
obei
then with her own hand she thrust at the stern of the boat caus
it to move into the channel next moment belti had shrunk back into
the dark and wa gone
now i would have return to seek for her but the jew at my side
call out
give wai give wai and question not the word of the queen who
doubtless ha work elsewher be swift doom is behind you
for a moment thei hesit then bent them to their oar while i
wonder what might be the mean of the part that belti plai did
she perchanc plan some trap for me i did not know but thi i knew
that behind wa the burn citi wherea in front lai the open sea
whatev it peril i would face the sea trust to destini to be my
guid as for belti doubtless she took some other road to freedom
mayhap after all she would shelter with mentor or ochu had promis
her deliver in payment for the blood of tene
so i sat silent and present the channel took a turn the swing
waterg that hid it mouth were thrust open with an oar by a man
who stood at the barg prow and we pass into the southern
harbour
ye out of the dark we pass into a blaze of light and out of
the silenc into a hideou tumult of sound for all around us the citi
burn furious and from it rose on horribl wail of woe
the rower saw and understood who until now had known noth in the
silenc of the secret harbour cave thei hung upon their oar then
thei brought round the barg prow see to return into the cave
but could not becaus those door had swung to behind them and have
lock themselv by some devic could onli be open from within
nor inde could i tell where these were sinc thei seem to form
part of the harbour wall
the helmsman look back and from side to side at the hell of fire
which rage behind and around him he look at the jut pier upon
our right and note that alreadi it timber were ablaz then he
look in front and cri
now i see why the queen left us well there is but on chanc
onward to the open sea
ay i echo onward to the open sea here you must die there i
will lead you to safeti i swear it by the queen of heaven
ti well to talk said on but how shall we gain the sea look
the persian ar bar the harbour mouth and slai those who
strive to escap
it wa true mani of the miser inhabit of sidon had found
boat of thi sort or of that or even were swim upon log or
barrel for these the persian or those in their pai wait at the
mouth of the harbour and with mock word and laughter butcher
them as thei came ye from their smaller ship thei slew them with
spear and arrow or by throw stone that drove out the bottom of
the boat
keep in the shadow of the jetti i said where the winddriven
smoke hang thick and near which the trirem dare not come becaus of
the rock whereon it is built and row row fast
thei heard and obei on we went beneath an arch canopi of smoke
lace with burst of flame from the kindl timber till at length
we reach the head of the jetti on which stood a wooden tower where a
light burn at night to be a guid to marin enter the harbour
here we wait a while cling to on of the pier for although the
wind wa rise in thi shelter place the sea remain calm
row across the head of the jetti wa a persian trirem and until
she had gone by we dare not attempt the sea at length she pass
leisur and our chanc came at a mutter word the oarsmen gave
wai with all their strength and we shot clear of the mole into the
open deep as we did so i look back and perceiv behind and abov
me a sight that after more than two thousand year still haunt me in
my sleep
upon the end of thi timbercrest mole as i have said there wa a
wooden tower from which in time of peac a beacon burn now thi
tower wa blaze like the pierwai behind it and no beacon shone
there onli where it should be stood a woman on whose face the strong
light beat sinc the wind swept awai the smoke and reveal her like
a statu on a column that rise abov mist i look at thi shape and
thi face and saw that thei were those of belti the queen of sidon
how she had come there i do not know but i think that she had run
along the burn mole befor it wa too late be well acquaint
with the path and had climb the stairwai of the tower that from
it crest she might look her last upon sidon and on life
there at least she stood royallook silent with her arm cross
upon her breast while the purpl cloak that mark her rank float
behind her like a banner on the breez
she saw the barg that bore us shoot out of the gloom and reek into
the deep sea i know that she saw becaus she stretch out her arm as
though to bless us then she turn and lift her hand toward the
burn citi as though to curs it lastli onc more she fold her
arm upon her breast and stood motionless her white face rais to
the heaven
thu she remain while on might count an hundr till suddenli the
timber of the tower gnaw through by the flame fell in and she
vanish in a roar gulf of fire
such wa the end of that great and illfat woman the royal belti
queen of sidon whom mayhap in expiat of sin done in anoth star
the god gave to the arm of perchanc the vilest man that ever live
upon the earth greatli she di a sacrific as her son had been a
sacrific but not befor she had wrought a fit vengeanc upon the
murder of her child and the betray of hi peopl moloch god of
fire took her as he took them all but now she wa beyond the reach
of moloch moloch who wa but molten metal an offer to himself
in the great flame of the fallen tower the trirem that bore the
banner of ochu saw our boat escap out to sea and put about to
pursu it
row on i cri row into the dark and know that their
live hung on the issu sinc as we had alreadi seen the persian
spare none whom thei overtook in the boat but drove the trirem
over them shoot ani who swam with arrow those sailor row
sturdili yet our progress wa but slow and that of the threebank
ship behind us fast moreov the fire of burn sidon lit up the
sea for mile
could we reach the dark befor we were overtaken we came to it
edg with the great trirem not a hundr pace from our sternso
near inde that the soldier on board of her began to shoot at us
though in the gather gloom and becaus of the roll platform on
which thei stood their shaft went wide she wa right upon us her
hull had vanish in the shadow but the light from the fire still
gleam upon her gild masthead while her great oar beat the sea
with a sound like thunder
put about i cri or she will sink us
veri skilfulli the steersman obei so that we doubl like a hunt
hare and the persian shot past us then onc more we turn and row
on into the night when it wrap us round the sailor exhaust
rest on their oar again we heard the thunder of the great slave
man sweep and again the brazen prow of the tall ship cruel
enorm hung almost over us onli by an ell or two did the broad
blade of the oar miss us the eddi that thei made caus our
littl craft to rock danger but thi time that huge seahound
wa blind by the dark and not see us nor hear anyth
for we sat silent as the grave she rush upon her wai and for a
time we saw her no more
all wa quiet upon the breast of ocean far off burn sidon like a
gigant beacon fire but there came to us no whisper of her agoni
ye all wa quiet save for the sigh of the night wind that to my
strang fanci seem like to such a sound as might be made by the
rush of ten thousand spirit pass from the cruel earth upward to
the peac abov slowli the weari oarsmen drove the boat still
farther out to sea then their captain said
whither awai ladi it is in my mind to chang our cours and run for
the coast northward where perchanc there ar no persian
nai i answer we stai where we ar i search for a ship
mayhap we shall find on he said with a hoars laugh a ship of
the fleet of ochu
thei began to disput as to what cours thei should take
obei me i said or obei me not as you will onli then i who have
the counsel of the god tell you that save i onli by sunris
tomorrow everyon of you will be dead
thei whisper togeth for my word frighten them at length the
captain spoke sai
the great queen belti who is gone told us that thi woman is a
goddess and that what she command that we must do let us rememb
the word of the great queen belti who is dead and doubtless watch
us from the sky
so thi danger pass also and all that night we float keep the
boat stern to burn sidon while the most of the oarsmen slept in
their place so weari were thei that not even the horror behind them
and the loss of their kinsfolk or even their own fear could hold
them back from sleep
but i ayesha did not sleep nai i watch and thought if philo had
fled awai or if hi ship had been sunk what then then all wa
finish nai not so sinc it could not be that i should die with
but half my task accomplish i wa friendless among strang men yet
in my breast there dwelt the greatest of friend that spirit whose
name is fate i threw out my soul to my master noot the seer and lo
it seem to me that hi soul answer sai
fear noth daughter of isi for the wing of isi shadow thee
it drew near to the dawn i knew it by the star which i wa wont to
watch and by the smell of the air i rose in my seat and stare into
the dark behold not four furlong from our prow suddenli there
sprang into life a fire of green flame
awak i cri and row on swiftli for if you would you live you
must reach the ship upon which yonder fire burn befor the break
of dawn
thei obei wonder who knew not what thi fire might mean we
sped forward and as the first light gleam saw almost abov us the
bulk of the great trirem name hapi
hail her i cri and the captain did so on appear by her
bulwark rail hold a lantern it light shone upon hi face and i
saw that it wa that of philo the greek
ye ar save i said quietli for yonder is the vessel that await
me
of a truth thi is a goddess mutter the captain of the barg
now philo saw us in the grow light and cri to us to come
swiftli point to someth which he could discov but we could
not we were alongsid eager hand drag us from the boat we were
aboard i still carri the casket of jewel though at the time i did
not know i held it fast philo bow the knee to me as to on divin
at which our oarsmen stare then he shout a command and again
point behind us
lo there scarc two bowshot awai wa the great persian ship which
we had escap in the gloom of the night
our oar struck the water we leapt forward like an unleash hound
and after us came the trirem like a lion spring on the hound
trirem have i call her nai as we saw now she wa a quinquerem
on of the new fivebank ship built by ochu a mighti monster for
a littl while she hesit as though wonder whether to attack or
let us be then as the light strengthen the ey of her watchmen
caught sight of our abandon boat and by it gild and emblem knew
it for the royal barg of tene
a great shout aros a shout of
the king escap the king and queen belti escap after them
then the quinquerem leapt forward in pursuit becaus of her bulk she
wa slow in gather speed and we who had the start of her drew awai
quickli especi after a shift of wind which seem to miss the
holi fire for so philo who knew her said the persian wa name
fill our great sail
see thi and hope that our danger wa past i went to that same
captain which had been mine when as the captiv of tene i sail upon
thi ship which seem to be just as i had left it thi i did
without speech to philo save a word to commend to hi care the jew
and those other who had been my companion upon the barg
for now that all wa over it seem to me as though i must rest or
die moreov i wa foul with travel and need food thi inde i
found readi upon a tabl which caus me to wonder though dulli
which i did even more when i saw clean woman garment such as i wa
accustom to us spread out upon the cabin couch so i cleans and
cloth myself and at a littl drink some wine which i did
rare then lai down upon the couch and for a space perhap slept
as though i were dead
i woke i knew not why who could have slumber on for hour yet
feel as though the most of my weari had roll off me the
place wa veri dim for the curtain door wa shut and at first i
could see noth present howev i becam awar that i wa not
alon in the cabin for as my ey grew accustom to such light as
reach it i discov the shape of a man an old whitebeard
man kneel at it far end as though in prayer and wonder whether
i dream for what could such a on be do here soon inde i wa
sure that i dream sinc thi shape wa that of the highpriest
noot my master whom i suppos to be far awai in egypt or perchanc
noot wa dead and thi wa hi spirit that visit me in my sleep
spirit or dream or man word came from the lip of that vision spoken
in the veri voic of noot such word as these

serv and obei i thank ye that ye have been pleas to bring thi
maiden in safeti through her appoint task throw over her the
shield of a strength divin i thank ye that ye have led her back to

world and all that live thereon that as ha been the begin so

length i brought it supplic to an end sai

he rose he came to me and draw asid a curtain on a littl
windowpl scan me with kind and gentl ey then he took my
outstretch hand kiss it and answer

the door wa open and the curtain drawn admit a rush of
sunlight lo there befor me stood a warrior clad in such armour as
the greek wear and thu attir the most beauti and gloriou
look man that ever my ey beheld

priest robe hi great form wa clad in bronz in place of a chaplet
a helm wa on hi head and in place of the sistrum hi hand grip
a sword hilt ye it wa kallikr he whose lip in past dai had
met mine in the holi shrine but as he had been befor he had vow
himself to isi becaus of a certain crime for now again he wa a man
and a captain of men not on who with bent brow and humbl mien from
hour to hour mutter prayer to an unseen divin
oh i will tell truth when i saw him thu i like him well ye
though for long he had been noth to me save a fellow servant of the
goddess onc more i wa thrill with a cup of that same wine which i
had seem to drink when our lip met far awai in egypt onc again
that fire which i had stamp to ash beneath my feet sprang to life
and scorch my heart
mayhap it wa hi beauti as great perhap as that of ani man who ever

chapter xii
the sea battl
the great persian ship wa on us strive as we would we could not
escap her she race upon our beam not a spear cast awai i stood
upon the high poop of the hapi and saw it all for the old arab
blood wa on fire in me as it had been when i charg in the battl
where my father fell and i would plai no woman part moreov my
spirit told me that i had not escap from the hand of tene and out
of the burn hell of sidon to die there upon the sea
stand thu upon the poop by the side of philo the cun captain
i note thi strang thing that no arrow wa shot and no spear thrown
from the persian deck she race alongsid us that wa all i
look at philo a question in my ey and he answer the question
briefli between hi set lip
thei think the king and queen ar aboard and would take us live
hark thei shout to us to surrend
again i look at him wonder what he would do
he issu an order and present our speed slacken so that we fell a
littl behind the persian he issu anoth order and we leapt
forward again under a chang helm now i saw that he wa mind to
ram the holi fire the persian saw it also and sheer off we ran
alongsid of her ship our oar as we came on that side which wa
nearest to her but the persian had no time to ship her our sharp
prow caught her fivefold line of sweep smash the most of them as
though thei were but twig and cast the rower in a broken
tumbl heap within her deep hold
that wa worthi of philo i said but he ever a humbl man as ar
all master of their trade shook hi head and answer
nai ladi i miss my mark and now we must pai for it ah i thought
so
as he spoke from sundri place on the holi fire grapnel flew out
which caught in the rail rope and row bench of the hapi
bind the two ship togeth
thei ar about to board us said philo now ladi prai to mother
isi to give us aid
then he blew two blast upon hi whistl instantli rose up upon our
deck a band of men nigh a hundr of them perhap clad in armour
and captain by the greek kallikr also behind these i saw the
crew of the royal barg arm with such weapon as thei could find
and the sailor of the hapi
the persian thrust out board or ladder from on ship to the other
across which their boarder most of them greek came in swarm the
fight began and it wa veri fierc our men cut down mani of the
foe and drown other by cast off the board and ladder so that
those on them fell into the sea still a great number of them won on
board of us and oh fierc wa that frai alwai in the thickest of
it i saw kallikr tower a head abov the other and who now
would have dream that he wa a priest of isi for he smote and
smote and man after man went down befor him while as hi sword rose
and fell he shout out some old greek battl cry such as onc hi
father us
on a space of deck ring round with dead and dy he came face to
face with the captain of the boarder a great and burli man also as
i think a greek thei fought terribl whilst other paus to watch
that frai which homer might have sung kallikr wa down and my
heart stood still nai he wa up again but hi bronz sword had
broken on the foeman mail
that foeman had an ax he swung it up to make an end kallikr
rush beneath it seiz him in hi arm and thei wrestl there
upon the slipperi deck the ship lurch togeth thei stagger to
the bulwark the foeman loos on arm and drew a dagger with it he
smote kallikr again and again kallikr bent and with hi
freed hand seiz the man beneath the knee by a mighti effort he
lift him to the bulwark edg and there thei clung awhil then
kallikr with that same freed hand smote the other on the brow
thrice he smote and hi blow were as those of a hammer fall on an
anvil
the grip of the captain of the boarder loosen and hi head hung
back onc more kallikr smote and behold hi foe roll down and
wa crush to powder between the swell side of the two great
ship as thei ground on against the other while the servant of isi
cheer and the sullen persian hord gave back
i caught sight of philo thrust hi wai along the bulwark he held
an ax in hi hand but he wa not fight nai he avoid those who
fought onc inde he stood still and gave an order note as i had
done that of a sudden the wind had begun to blow certain sailor who
heard thi order ran to the mast and i saw the great sail rise
slowli
meanwhil philo slip along those bulwark take cover beneath
them like a jackal beneath a wall but whenev he came to on of the
grapnel he stop and smote it with hi ax sever the rope that
held it three of them did he sever thu so that the prow of the
vessel swung apart
now the great sail wa up and fill the hapi forg ahead
drag round the stern of the holi fire by those grapnel that
remain the persian understood and grew frighten those who were
still aliv upon our deck rush to the plank and ladder but few
gain them for kallikr and the men of isi were on their heel
thei were cut down thei fell from the slide plank and ladder or
thei leapt into the sea and for the most part drown there veri soon
not on of them wa left upon our deck
the grapnel were torn awai or the rope broke we were free yet the
persian wa not beaten for she wa full of men of whom those who had
been kill were but a tith
she too hoist her sail and thrust out fresh sweep to continu the
pursuit her captain stand on her prow roar out
dog of egyptian ill hang you yet
philo heard and took up hi bow now we were sweep across the bow
of the holi fire mayhap it wa a hundr pace awai philo aim
and shot so truli did he shoot that hi arrow struck the persian
captain beneath hi helm and down he went
hi fall seem to bewild the crew of the holi fire thei hung
upon their oar shout at each other as though thei knew not what
to do then their sail began to rise and i saw that thei were put
about
philo at my side laugh a hard littl laugh
mother isi is good to us he said see the hunter ha becom the
hunt
then he gave order and we came round so that our great sail taken
aback flap against the mast
down with the sail and row he shout row as never ye row
befor
those at the sweep obei oh it wa splendid to see them bend
their broad back and tug at the oar till these also bent like
bow in the water here wa no slave work for thei were servant of
isi and free men everi on of them philo rush to the steer
gear and with the aid of anoth man took charg of it himself we
leapt forward like a panther on it prei the holi fire saw and
strove to escap too late too late for present the sharp prow of
the hapi crash into her side with such a shock that all who stood
upon the deck were thrown down i among them i struggl to my feet
again and heard philo scream
back water back lest she take us with her
we back slowli the prow appear again from where it wa buri
three pace deep in the foeman flank
the holi fire reel over the water rush in through the gap
crippl and helpless she wallow ay she began to sink from her
swarm deck went up a yell of terror and dismai still the water
rush in with an evergath flood and still she sank and sank
men threw up their arm prai for merci men sprang into the sea
then suddenli the holi fire rear her glitter prow into the air
and stern foremost vanish into the deep it wa finish
the persian swam about us or clung to wreckag prai to be taken
aboard but we row on come to the wind again i know not how it is
in the world todai but then in time of war there wa littl merci
egypt alon wa merci becaus ag had mellow her and becaus of
her gentl worship of her gentl god but now egypt wa fight for
her life against the persian so we row on and those barbarian
were abandon to drown and in the world below seek the warmth of the
fire thei worship
philo left the helm and came to where i stood i note that he wa
white and shaken and call to on to bring him wine he drank of it
thankfulli not forget first to pour a libat at my feet or
rather at those of the goddess to whom i wa so near
brave done i said you understand your trade philo
not so ill ladi though it might have been better had i been at the
helm we should have ram that swarm hulk befor the board and
save some live well set ha her now and ochu lack hi finest
ship
it might have been far otherwis i said
ay ladi had i command the holi fire it would have been
otherwis for she had two oar and three men to our on but her
captain wa want in seacraft and when my arrow found him there
wa none to take hi place thei should have swept us with their
boarder but that all greek captain call kallikr who thei tell
me wa onc a priest handl hi soldier well he is a gallant man
and i griev that we ar like to lose him
why i ask
oh becaus in hi fight with a fellow whom he flung over the
bulwark he took a knifethrust in the vital which thei think will
be mortal see thei ar bear him to my cabin and he point to
kallikr be carri forward by four mena sight that stir my
heart
then philo wa summon awai for it seem that when the hapi
ram she sprang a leak and the carpent call philo to consult
with them as to how it might be stop
when thei had gone i follow after kallikr and found him laid in
philo cabin thei had taken off hi armour and the leech an
egyptian wa clean a cut in hi thigh whenc the blood ran down
hi ivori skin
is it mortal i ask
i know not ladi answer the leech i cannot tell the depth of
the thrust prai isi for him for he ha lost much blood
now i who wa skill in medicin and in the treatment of wound which
i had learn from a great master in my youth among the arab help
that physician as best i might staunch the blood flow and
stitch up the cut with silk befor we bandag it
moreov take from my hand a charm and ancient amulet that gave
health and had the power so it wa said to caus the sick or wound
to recov i set it on the finger of kallikr that it might cure
him thi amulet wa a ring of brown stone on which were graven
certain hieroglyph that meant royal son of the sun he who gave
it to me told me that it had been worn by that greatest of all healer
and magician khaemua the eldest son of the mighti rames onc
onli did i see thi ring again as shall be told then of it i lost
sight and knowledg till after more than two thousand year i beheld
it on the hand of holli in the cave of kor
as i work thu the pain of the needl awok kallikr from hi
swoon he open hi ey look up and saw me then mutter in
greek so low that onli i who wa bend over him heard hi word
thei were
i thank thee belov i thank thee and the god who have grant
that like my forefath i should die no priest but a soldier and a
man yea i thank thee o royal and beauti amenarta
then he swoon again and i left him quickli have learn that it
wa of the egyptian he dream and doubtless that it wa for the sake
of thi same egyptian that he had chang hi sacr robe for mail
ye the egyptian amenarta for whom he had mistaken me ayesha in
the wander of hi weak
well why not what had i to do with him or ani man yet of a sudden i
grew weari of the world and almost wish that the holi fire had
ram the hapi and not the hapi the holi fire
yonder behind us a thousand men were now at peac beneath the sea
be overwrought with all that i had endur and seen almost i could
have wish that i too wa at peac beneath the sea sleep for
ever or perchanc to wake again nurs in the holi arm of isi
in the cabin sat my master the prophet noot stare through the open
doorwai at the infinit blue of heaven abov as i knew that he had
done dure all that fearsom fight
he smile when he saw me and ask
whenc come you daughter and why do your ey shine like star
i come from the sight of the death of men my father and my ey
shine with the light of battl
with other light also i think daughter o ayesha beauti is your
wisdom is your and you ar fill with spirit like a cup with wine
but what of the cup what of the cup i fear me that those fair feet
of your have far to travel befor thei reach their home
what is their home father
do you not know it after these mani year of learn hearken i
will tell you your home is god not thi god or that god call by a
hundr name but the god beyond the god doubtless you will love
and you will hate as you have love and hate and doubtless you ar
destin to draw up what you love and to come to peac with what you
hate yet know that abov all mortal love there is anoth love in
which thei must be both lost and found god is the end of man o
ayesha god ordeath all sin all stumbl on the path but onli
those who continu on that path or who have lost it with tear and
broken heart seek it again and like the sisyphu of fabl thrust
befor them their frozen load of fleshli error till at length it
melt in the light that shine abov onli those i sai attain to the
etern peac
so solemnli did he speak utter the slow word on by on and so
deep and holi wa the lesson that thei hid that i ayesha grew
afraid
what have you seen and what do you know my father i ask humbl
daughter i have seen you yonder in sidon rejoic in vengeanc for
vengeanc sake ay glad when the vile hound who would have grip
you gasp out hi life befor your ey you did not slai him
ayesha but it wa your counsel that gave cun to the thought that
plan and strength to the arm that dealt the blow
it wa so fate o my father and otherwis
ye it wa so fate yet you should not have rejoic in the hour of
your triumph nai you should have sorrow as the god sorrow when
thei fulfil the decre of destini again i have seen you burn with
the flame of battl your heart fill with song of victori when
philo skill and the grecian courag of kallikr sent those mad
brute of persian to their account and lastli unless i dream
what did you but now in philo cabin daughter
i tend a wound man my father as i have the skill to do also i
gave him an amulet which it is said ha virtu to heal the sick
ay that wa right and kind and the just reward of courag did he
thank you daughter i thought that in the quiet i heard thank come
from hi lip
nai i answer sullenli hi mind wander and he thankedanoth
woman who wa not there
again noot smile a littl and answer
wa it so then let her name be yet rememb that from such
wander of a mind distraught ofttim spring the truth like water
from a shatter rock oh daughter daughter if thi man forget hi
vow must you do the same for him there is excus who is a soldier
can we doubt it who have look upon hi deed todai he becam a
priest for love sake and the shed blood which it brought but for
you there is noneat least none upon the earth he ad hastili i
prai you therefor let thi man be for if you do not my gift of
wisdom tell me that you will bring much troubl on your head and hi
why will you seek after vaniti is it becaus in the pride of your
beauti you cannot bear that anoth should be prefer befor you and
that a fruit which it is not law for you to pluck should fall into
some other woman lap i sai to you daughter that thi beauti is
your curs becaus to it you demand obedi night and dai although
of it you should think noth rememb it end you ar too
proud you ar too puf up look upon the star and learn to be
humbl lest you should be humbl by that which is stronger
i am still a woman father a woman whose mission it is to love and
to bear babe
then learn to love that which is abov and let the babe you bear be
those of wisdom and good work is it your part to suckl sinner like
ani hedgesid troll you to whom the heaven stretch out their hand
is it for you in whose breast spring the tree of life to root it up
and in it place to sow the seed of a woman common art that by
their aid you mai snatch her lover from a rival becaus he sin if
sin he doe should you ceas from be holi where is your
great where ar your puriti and pride i prai to you belov
daughter of my spirit swear to me by heaven which we serv that with
thi man you will have no more to do twice have you sinnedonc in
the sanctuari yonder at phila when hi kiss met your and now again
not an hour gone upon thi ship when your heart wa torn with jealou
rage becaus the name of anoth woman escap from lip that you
thought were about to shape your own twice have you sin and twice
ha the goddess turn her head and shut her ey but if for a third
time you should walk into thi pit dug of your own hand then know
that escap will be hard inde i tell youher hi face and hi
low voic hardenedi tell you that from ag to ag shall you strive
unceasingli to wash the stain of blood from off those hand and that
all your breath shall becom a sigh and your everi heartbeat shall be
an agoni swear then swear
i look at hi ey and saw that thei were alight and unearthli ye
that some spirit shine from within caus them to glow like
alabast lamp i look at the thin hand which he stretch out
toward me and saw that it trembl in hi passion
i look and wa move to obei yet er i did so i ask
were you ever young my father did you ever suffer from thi
etern curs which natur lai on men and women becaus she would not
die did you ever take the bribe of sweet mad with which she
bait her hook or as onc i think you told me in bygon year were
you alwai holi and apart
he cover hi ey with those thin hand then answer
i wa young i suffer from that curs whatev i mai have said to
you in the past when you were but a child i gorg that bait not
onc but mani time and i have paid the price becaus i have paid it
to my ruin i prai you whom i love not to empti your heart of it
purest virgin gold and fill the void with pain and penit easi is
it to fall daughter but hard veri hard to rise again will you not
swear
ay i answer i swear by isi and by your spirit o purifi
you swear he said whisper but will you keep the oath i
wonder ay i wonder greatli will you keep that oath o highheart
woman whose blood run with so red and strong a stream
then bend forward he kiss me on the brow and rise left me
kallikr did not die under the care of that cun leech or of
someth abov the leech death wa cheat of him sinc it seem
that the knifethrust had not reach hi vital or at least had not
pierc them beyond repair still he wa sick for a long while for
hi whole bodi wa drain of blood so that had he been older or
less vigor osiri would have taken him or perchanc not in vain
had i set upon hi finger that scarabtalisman onc charm by
khaemua i visit him no more and thu it wa not until we were
pass up the nile and drew near to memphi that i saw him again
then veri pale and wast yet to my fanci more pleas than he had
been sinc now hi face had grown spiritu and hi ey were those
of on that had look close into those of death he wa carri in a
bed on to the deck there i spoke with him thank him in the name
of the goddess for the great deed that he had done he smile and hi
white face took a littl ting of red as he answer
i fear me o mouthofisi that it wa not of the goddess that i
thought in that frai but rather of the joi of battl which i a
priest had never hope to feel again nai nor wa it for the goddess
that i smote as best i could sinc in the extrem of war the
gate of heaven which ar then in truth so near seem veri far awai
but rather that after all which you had pass you with the rest of
us might not fall into the hand of the heathen fireworshipp
now i smile back for the word if fals were courteou and
repli that doubtless also he who wa still young desir to go on
live
nai he answer earnestli i think that i desir to die rather
than to live and to pass henc as often my forefath have done
sword in hand and helm on head life is no boon to a shaven priest
ladi on who by hi vow is cut off from all it joi
what is a man joi in life i ask
look at yourself in a mirror ladi and you will learn he answer
and there wa that in hi voic which caus me to wonder whether it
wa possibl after all that the wrong name came from hi lip in the
wander of hi mind
for then i did not know that a man mai love two women and at the same
time on with hi spirit and the other with hi flesh sinc through
all thing run thi war between the spirit and the flesh the spirit
of kallikr wa alwai mine have been given to me from the
begin but with hi flesh it wa otherwis and perchanc while he
is in the flesh it will so remain
befor we reach memphi a signal wa made for us to anchor then a
barg fly the standard of pharaoh came off to us from the shore
on board of it wa nectaneb himself and with him hi daughter the
princess of egypt the ladi amenarta also certain councillor and
grecian captain in hi servic
the pharaoh and the other came aboard to learn tide of what had
chanc at sidon and were receiv by philo and by noot present
thei demand to be led to me and i met them on the deck outsid my
cabin note that the ey of nectaneb were troubl and that hi
fat cheek had fallen in
so you ar return to us oracleofisi he said in a hesit
voic scan my form for my face he could not see becaus it wa
veil
i am return o pharaoh i answer bow befor hi majesti it
ha pleas her whom i serv to deliv me out of the hand of king
tene of sidon to whom pharaoh offer me as a gift
ay i rememb it wa at that feast when the water in the cup you
held turn to blood well if all i hear is true there ha been
blood enough out yonder
ye pharaoh the sidonian sea run red with it tene egypt alli
surrend the citi to ochu the persian think to find great
advanc which he won by death whereon the sidonian burn
themselv in their hous with their wive and children so it come
about that all phoenicia is in the hand of ochu who advanc upon
egypt with a mighti host
the god have desert me moan nectaneb wave hi arm
ay pharaoh i answer in a cold voic for the god ar veri
jealou and seldom forgiv those who forsak them and betrai their
servant into the hand of enemi that hate them
he understood and answer in a low babbl voic
be not angri with me oracleofisi for what els could i do that
sidonian dog whom mai set devour etern wa mad for you alwai i
mistrust him and i wa sure that if i refus you to him he would
make hi peac with ochu and bite me in the back as inde he
threaten at the feast also i knew well that mother isi would
protect you from all harm at hi hand which it seem that she ha
done
now when i heard these word rage fill me and i answer
ay pharaoh mother isi ha done thi and more have you heard how
your poison work nai then i will tell you have sacrif her
onli son to dagon tene would have put awai belti hi queen to
give her place to me mad with hate belti led him into the arm of
the persian and afterward when hi treacheri wa accomplish slew
him with her own hand for i saw the deed and now pharaoh sidon ha
fallen and with it all phoenicia and soon pharaoh egypt will follow
sidon ay i the oracl tell you that becaus you were pleas to
throw the highpriestess of isi into the arm of tene as though she
were some sing woman of whom you had weari these thing have
come about therefor too soon there will no longer be a pharaoh in
egypt and the persian will take the land of nile and defil the altar
of it god
he heard he trembl he had naught to sai but there wa anoth who
heard also as i had note the princess amenarta when she came on
to the ship went straight to where kallikr lai upon a couch
beneath an awn on the deck and there talk with him earnestli
what thei said i could not hear for thei spoke togeth beneath their
breath but their face i could see and watch them i grew sure
that the greek had made no error of a mind distraught when he spoke
thi royal ladi name as i tend hi wound for those face were
the face of lover who met after long separ and the pass of
great danger
leav kallikr thi amenarta had return to her father and
stood at hi side listen to our talk now she broke in fierc
sure priestess you were ever a bird of evil omen croak of
disast you fly to sidon and lo sidon burn yet you escap with
wing unscorch now you flit back to egypt and again wail of woe
like a night owl of the desert how is it o isiscometoearth as it
pleas you to call yourself that you alon escap from sidon and
return here to curdl the blood of men with propheci such as those
you utter at the feast when by a trick you turn the water into
blood have you perchanc made friend with ochu
ask it of philo the captain of thi ship ladi i answer in a
quiet voic or stai ask it of yonder priest which perchanc will
pleas you better the grecian who in the world wa name kallikr
ask them how i show friendship to ochu by so work through the
strength of isi and their skill and valour that the persian finest
ship of war with a multitud of hi sailor and fight men li
todai at the bottom of the deep
perchanc becaus a captain wa skill and a certain priest or
soldier wa brave that ship is sunk with all she bore but not i
think through you or your prayer o oracl i sai to you pharaoh
my father that if i held your sceptr i would send thi isiscom
toearth to seek isi in heaven er she bring more sorrow on us and
egypt
nai nai mutter nectaneb roll hi big ey speak not so
madli daughter lest the mother should hear and onc more smite me
hearken last night i who have skill consult my spirit the daemon
who obei me he came he spoke i heard him with my ear ye he
spoke of thi prophetess he said that she drew near to memphi on a
ship he said that she wa great almost a goddess that she must be
cherish that to you and me she would be a shelter from the storm
that in her is the power of on who sit abov o oracl o isiscom
toearth o wisdom daughter forgiv the wild word of thi royal
child of mine who is distraught with fear and know that to the last
pharaoh is your friend and your protector
as mayhap if thi daemon of your speak truth befor all is done i
shall be the protector of pharaoh and of the princess of egypt whom it
pleas to revil me i repli
then bow to him i turn and sought my cabin
chapter xiii
the shame of pharaoh
when pharaoh and hi daughter had gone though i did not see them go
i bade farewel to philo thank him much and in reward for all he
had done call down on him the bless of the goddess which he
receiv upon hi bend knee moreov when he had risen from them
he swore himself to my servic sai that while he live he would
come even from the end of the earth to do my will also he show me
how i might call him by certain secret wai
so we bade farewel for a while nor did i let him go emptyhand
sinc from those jewel that tene had heap upon me which almost by
accid i had preserv in my flight i took certain of great valu
and gave them to him as a gift from the goddess thu we part
though as both of us were sure not for the last time
so soon as our come wa known the priest and priestess of isi
flock to the quai in solemn process to receiv noot their high
priest and me their highpriestess which thei did with sacr
ceremoni and holi chant by them we were escort through the street
of memphi to the templ of isi accompani by mani of the crew of
the hapi that were of our brotherhood among them i miss on
where is the priest kallikr i ask of noot
he smile and answer
i think that he ha been taken to the palac of pharaoh to be nurs
until he recov from hi wound perchanc for a while he is mind
or it is decre that he should continu to plai a warrior part yet
fear not daughter those upon whose brow isi ha laid her hand in
life or death must return to her at last thei ar hawk upon a string
which though it stretch cannot be broken
ay i answer in life or death and ask no more of thi
kallikr
in the midst of the rejoic of the citi at our safe return we came
to the templ and made sacrific there it wa that i set the jewel
of tene all save those that i had given to philo upon the alabast
statu of the goddess in her inmost shrine that onli i and noot might
enter and there too by sign and wonder she signifi to me her
accept of the offer for here while we stood alon befor the
effigi of the goddess in that holi place a tranc fell upon noot and
in hi tranc he spoke to me with the voic of isi and out of her
infinit heart thi wa the divin messag that came to me through
the lip of noot
daughter i thy mother know of all that thou hast pass and of all
that thou must pass though the barbarian come and the god of egypt
ar thrown down and ruin smite the land and thou seemest to be left
alon abid thou here till my word bid thee to depart by myself and
that of which under the name of isi i am a minist i swear that no
harm shall befal thee or that place where thou art or those of my
servant who remain with thee therefor await my command with
patienc do such thing as i inspir thee to do that thou mayest
bring the vengeanc of the god upon those dog who desecr their
shrine
thu spoke noot in hi tranc not know what he had said until i
told him afterward he listen earnestli and bade me obei
even if i be taken from you for a while as it come to me will
happenperch i learn it in my swoon daughterand you ar left
unfriend and alon still i prai you to obei if so think not that
i am dead who do but return to my own place and land but wait until
my messag come then obei that also though i know not what it will
be
thu he spoke solemnli and i bow my head and hid hi word within my
heart
the war began egypt last war for life nectaneb as the pharaoh
inspir by hi evil daemon thrust asid hi captain and declar
himself gener in chief of hi armi he who had scarc the wit or
the courag to command the guard of a harem at first that daemon
serv him well sinc at barathra as the gulf ar name which make
the sirbonian bog the persian were trap and lost mani thousand
of their men who sank through the sand into the marsh and there were
drown or spear but their number were uncount and the rest
came on pelusium wa besieg and for a while held it own against
the giant nicostratu of argo a man as strong as hercul who like
hercul cloth himself in a lion skin and for a weapon bore a
great club the grecian captain kleinio of co he who had been
present at the feast when i wa given over to tene and whom in my
vision at that feast i had seen dead ly upon a heap of slain
attack nicostratu and after a mighti fight wa defeat kleinio
and five thousand men of those who were with him be slain thu wa
my vision fulfil
then hi daemon depart from nectaneb take hi heart with him for
of a sudden pharaoh ceas to be a man and becom a coward fled
back to memphi leav hi fleet hi citi and their garrison to
their fate
rumour ran fast it told of the fall of citi after citi some storm
some bribe to surrend it told that ochu had sworn to burn memphi
and after it thebe also to seiz nectaneb and roast him live
upon the altar in the great templ of ptah here at memphi or
otherwis to make him fight with the bull api after the beast had
been driven mad by fieri dart it told that the egyptian enrag at
the desert of their armi by pharaoh would themselv seiz him
and give him up to ochu as a peaceoff crowd gather and
rush through the street of memphi call imprec on hi
name or cluster like bee round the altar of the god prai for
help in their despair ye round the neglect altar of the god of
egypt
then of a sudden came amenarta fly to the templ of isi for
sanctuari sinc it wa report that ochu had said that the shrine
of isi he would spare alon becaus she wa the mother of all thing
and her throne wa the moon and her husband wa osirisra who wa the
father of fire which he worship also becaus a certain priestess
of the goddess had done him great servic in the war word that
caus me to wonder
so thi royal priestess came and put on the veil of a novic that it
might protect her should ochu take the citi but though thi veil
chang her face and form to the ey of men her heart it did not
chang
a littl later came kallikr from the war in the delta where i
learn that he had done great thing fight brave inde he
told me himself that he had fought the giant nicostratu in singl
combat and wound him though the matter wa not press to an end
sinc other rush up and separ them he said that he wa a veri
terribl man and that when that huge club of hi waver abov him
for the first time in hi life he felt afraid notwithstand he ran
in beneath the club and stab nicostratu in the shoulder
thu it happen that all be lost in war and hi servic at an end
kallikr the captain onc more becam kallikr the priest and
again put on the robe of isi therefor in that templ serv
togeth befor it altar were amenarta princess of egypt and
kallikr priest of isi
often i ayesha seat in my chair of state as first of that holi
compani save the ag noot alon watch them from beneath my veil
while thei anoint the statu of the goddess or join in the sacr
chant and hymn of prais as i watch i note thisthat alwai
thei drew near togeth as though some strength compel them that
alwai their glanc thrown from the corner of their ey met and
turn awai and met again and that alwai if occas serv the
robe of the on brush the robe of the other or the hand of the on
touch the hand of the other these thing i note in silenc
wonder what judgment the goddess would call down upon thi
beauteou pair who dare thu to violat her sanctuari with their
earthli passion oh much i wonder though littl did i guess what
it would be and by whose hand it wa destin to fall upon them
lastli came nectaneb himself hi great ey full of terror and hi
fat frame wast with woe and sleepless he sought audienc of me
o prophetess he said all is lost ochu artaxerx ha hi foot
upon my neck i fly seek shelter beneath the wing of isi
seek shelter from you o isiscometoearth help me daughter
divin for my daemon ha desert me or if he come at all it is but
to jibber and to mock
strang word from pharaoh i answer in a voic of scorn veri
strang word from pharaoh who gave thi same prophetess to be the
woman of a vile baalserv king from pharaoh who ha desert hi
armi hi countri and hi god and now seek onli to save hi
treasur and hi life
reproach me not he moan fate ha been too strong for me as
perchanc on dai it mai be too strong for you also at first all went
well in the bygon year i conquer the persian i built templ to
the god then of a sudden fortun hid her face and nowand now
ay o fallen pharaoh i answer and why did fortun hide her
face i will tell it to whom it ha been reveal it wa becaus
although you built templ to the god you were fals to the god in
secret follow the counsel of that daemon of your you made bloodi
sacrific to devil to baal to ashtoreth and to aphrodit of the
greek nai do not start and deni for i know all lastli to crown
your crime you gave me the highprophetess of isi to the base
redhand tene on who offer hi own son to idol what ha
chanc to tene who took me and sai what shall chanc to him who
sold me o nectaneb no more a pharaoh
now i thought that sure he would kill me and care not if he did
for my heart wa soreoh becaus of mani thing my heart wa sore
but like a beaten cur he onli cower at my feet prai me to pardon
him prai me to ceas from beat him with my tongu prai me
to counsel him i listen and piti took hold of me who wa ever
tendermind though a lover of justic and a hater of traitor
hearken i said at last if ochu find you here o fallen pharaoh
first he will make a mock of you and then he will tortur you to
death i have heard what he will do he will bring you to hi judgment
seat and lai you bound upon your back and grind hi sandal upon your
face then he will forc you to sacrific to the fire that he worship
and on by on to spit upon the effigi of the god of egypt lastli
either he will caus the holi bull api to gore you to death or he
will bind you upon the altar in the templ of ptah and there slowli
with torment bring you to your end
now when nectaneb heard these thing he wept and i thought that he
would swoon awai
hearken i said again i will show you a road wherebi although
defeat and disgrac you mai yet win glori that shall be told of
from ag to ag summon the peopl while there is yet time go to the
templ of ammon king of the god of egypt stand befor the shrine of
ammon and make confess of your sin in the ear of all then there
in the sight of all slai yourself prai ammon and all the god to
accept your life as an offer and to spare egypt and the peopl upon
whose head you the hate of the god have brought all these woe so
can you caus the persian and the world to marvel and sai that though
accurs still you were great and so perchanc you shall turn awai
the wrath of heaven from apost egypt
a flash of pride shone in hi ey that had been empti of light and
fill with tear he lift hi head stiffli as though still it felt
the weight of the great ear of state the golden uraeu and the
doubl crown for a moment he look as onc he had done at sai
review hi triumphant armi after hi first victori over the
persian and drink in the incens of it shout ye he look as
great thotm and the proud rames might have done in their dai a
pharaoh the king of all the world he knew
it would be well to die thu he murmur it would be veri well
and then perhap the god i have betrai would forgiv me the old
old god to whom thirti dynasti of record king have bow the
knee and those who went befor them for unnumb gener ye
then perhap that great compani of pharaoh would not turn their back
on me or spit at me when i join them at the tabl of osiri but
prophetessher hi face fell in again and hi crablik ey
project and roll while hi voic sank to a whisper prophetess
i dare not
why nectaneb
becauseoh becaus year ago i struck a bargain with a certain
power of the underworld a daemon if you will at least some spirit of
evil that come i know not whenc and dwell i know not where which
becam manifest to me it promis me glori and success if i would
sacrific to itnai i will not tell what i sacrif but onc i
had a son ye like tene i had a son
here i ayesha shiver then motion to him to speak on
thi wa the bargain that though to pleas the peopl i might build
templ to the god by certain mean i must defil them in their
shrine ay and i did defil them and when the priest dress me
the pharaoh in the trap of those god accord to custom by
thought and word and deed i blasphem them yet on divin remain
outsid the pact becaus my daemon warn me that she wa too strong
for him and must not be offend and he paus
wa she perchanc name isi i ask
ay prophetess she wa name isi and therefor i never pollut
her shrine and therefor to her alon in my heart i offer prayer so
all went well and i gather great armi and vast wealth i hire
greek by thousand to fight for me i made allianc with mani king
and wa sure that again i should defeat the persian and be the master
of the world then came the evil hour of that accurs feast at which
you the mouth of isi were summon to prophesi and move by some
mad you unveil your beauti befor tene and i forget
whose minist you were gave you to tene therebi outrag isi in
your person
did i not warn you nectaneb and did not the holi noot warn you
ay you warn me but in my need i took the risk or i forgot from
that moment all went ill and ruin like a giant befor whom none mai
stand ha hunt me by night and dai
ye nectaneb and isi is the name of that giant
i made error upon error he went on i trust to tene and tene
betrai me my daemon counsel me to thrust asid the grecian
gener and take command of the armi and at first there wa
victori then came defeat it might have been retriev but of a
sudden my courag fail me it fell like a templ of which the
foundat have been wash out by hidden water it crash down in
a moment it proud pylon it tall column it massiv honour
wall blazon with the record of gloriou deed fell to a shapeless
heap hidden in the dust of shame i am undon i am what you see a
loathsom worm a wound worm wriggl in the black slime of
despair i who wa pharaoh
again piti touch me ayesha and i answer
there still remain the road that i have point out while we live
howev black our record repent is alwai possibl sinc
otherwis there would be no hope for man the sinner moreov
repent if it be true bring amend in it train and thi
godborn pair struggl upward hand in hand over cruel rock
through swamp and stream through brake and briar blind with
tear and the gross dark of despair at length see the sweet shape
of forgiv shine befor them like a holi dawn such as never
gleam upon thi world hearken therefor to on who speak not with
her own voic or out of the foolish of her own weak flesh but as
she is command of a spirit that is within her go to the templ of
ammon and there in the presenc of the peopl make confess of your
sin and fall a sacrific upon your sword selfmurd is a sin but
occas come when to live on is a greater sin sinc it is better to
die for other than to cherish breath that poison them
to die there you speak it prophetess i sai again that i dare not
die when i die i pass to the daemon thi wa the pact that for my
life he should give me success and glori and that in return after
death i should surrend him my soul
is it so i answer well the bargain is ancient as old as the
world i think on also that everi human be in hi degre seal or
refus to seal in thi wai or in that still my counsel hold thi
daemon of your ha broken hi oath for where now ar the success and
glori nectaneb therefor he cannot claim the fulfil of your
own
nai prophetess he answer in a wail voic he ha not
broken it from the first he told me that i must work no harm to isi
the mother sinc the queen of heaven wa more power than all the
denizen of hell and that if onc it were spoken her word of
strength would pierc and shrivel him like a redhot sword and cut
hi web of spell would bring hi oath to nothing and me with
them and now the web is cut and i the paint insect that it mesh
fall from it to where the hellborn spider sit in hi hole
prophetess i have seen him with these ey i have seen hi orb of
fire i have seen hi snout and fang like to those of a crocodil i
have seen hi great hairi arm and the search talon stretch out
to grip me and i tell you that i dare not die to be cast into the
jaw of the devour and burn etern in hi belli of flame show
me how to save my life so that i mai continu to look upon the sun
oh becaus you ar a tender woman and charit though i have
sin against you show me how to save my life
now hear thi creatur plead with me thu thi coward who at the
last did not dare go face the indign god like a man sai as a
great soul should i have deepli er o ye god i repent pardon
me of your nobil or slai my soul and make an end my piti left me
and it place wa fill with scorn and loath
those who would live when the persian dog ar on their heel must
fly fast and far nectaneb thei must fly like the deer of the
desert on whom the hunter close the road up nile is empti
nectaneb as yet there ar no persian there as you would not die
take it and live
ay he said as the thought went home why not i have still a vast
treasur for mani year i have hoard against misfortun for who
can put all hi trust in ani daemon with it i can bui friend in the
south with it i mai found anoth empir among the ethiopian or
those of punt why should i not fly prophetess
i know not i answer save that death is alwai fast and untir
and in the end wear down the swiftest runner
thi i said darkli for at that moment there came into my mind a vision
that onc i had seen of a certain servil slave aforetim a pharaoh
that same royal slave who grovel befor me yea a vision of him
throttl in a rope while black men mock him yet of that i said
noth onli ad
if it should pleas you to go south nectaneb would it pleas you
also to take with you that royal and beauti ladi amenarta your
daughter aforetim princess of egypt
nai he answer sharpli sinc hour by hour she scourg me with
her tongu becaus i am fallen let her abid here under the veil of
isi yet why do you ask thi prophetess
becaus of isi becaus as i think thi ladi of the royal blood
make plai with a certain priest who is sworn to isi and the goddess
doe not love that her vow servitor should desert her for the sake
of mortal woman
what priest he ask dulli
a greek who is name kallikr
i know him prophetess a veri beauteou man like to their own
apollo a brave on too who did good servic yonder in the marsh
fight the giant gener whom he wound also i rememb that in
the past he wa a captain of my guard befor he becam a priest and
that there wa troubl concern him though what troubl i forget
save that amenarta plead for him well if he ha offend you
there ar still those who do my will send for him and if it pleas
you he shall be kill i give you hi life ye hi blood shall
flow at your feet inde i will command it at onc sinc you tell me
he ha shame the goddess or anger you her priestess and he
open hi hand to clap them summon the messeng of death
i saw i thrust my arm between so that thei struck not upon each
other but upon my soft flesh make no sound
nai i said thi warriorpriest is a good servant of the queen
isi on moreov who fought for me her prophetess upon the sea
he shall not die for so small a matter yet i prai you nectaneb
take with you the royal princess amenarta when you fly south with
your treasur
ay he answer wearili as it is your desir ill take her if she
will come though if so there will be small rest for me
then he went bow to me humbl and thi wa my farewel to
nectaneb the last pharaoh of egypt i watch him go and wonder
whether i had done well in forbid him to kill kallikr it came
into my mind that the death of thi man would save me much troubl
why should he not die as other did who had sin against the
goddess an answer rose within me it wa that he had sin not onli
against the goddess but also against meand thi by prefer
anoth woman befor me
wa i then so feebl that i could not hold my own against anoth
woman should i choos to do so nai yet my troubl wa that i did not
choos
now i saw the truth my rebelli flesh desir that which my spirit
reject my spirit wa far from thi man yet my flesh would have him
near ay my flesh said let him be slain rather than anoth should
take him while my spirit answer what ha he to do with on whose
soul is set upon thing abov let him go hi wai and go you your
abov all be not stain with hi blood
so i let him go not know that it wa written in the book of fate
that i must be stain with hi blood steep in it to the ey
ay i save him from the sword of nectaneb and let him go
determin to think of him no more
yet as it chanc fate plai me an evil trick in thi matter on the
morrow or the next dai i sat in the gloom of the outer sanctuari
prai to the goddess to eas me of my sore heart for ala strive
as i would to hide it that heart wa sore there came a whiterob
priest kallikr himself but chang inde from that gloriou
grecian warrior who had beat back the boarder on the hapi or who
had fought in singl combat with the giant nicostratu for now the
littl golden curl were shaven from hi head and he wa pale with the
thin diet of the fruit of the earth and pure water which alon might
pass the lip of those who were sworn to isi enough inde for me
who touch no other food or such a on as the ag noot but not for
a greatfram man bred to the trade of arm moreov hi face wa
troubl as though with some struggl of the soul
he pass me unseen and go to the statu of the goddess knelt down
befor it and prai earnestli perhap for help and bless rise
at length onc more he pass me and i saw that hi grai ey were
full of tear and long to comfort him also i saw that still he
carri on hi hand that ring talisman which i had set there upon the
ship hapi that it might perchanc defend him from the evil
influenc which desir and compass the death of men
he went out across the pillar court toward the cloister at it end
from thi cloister appear a woman the dark and beauteou amenarta
herself thi wa easi to see sinc i know not why she had put off
the veil of isi and wa glorious attir in the robe of a princess
scanti enough i thought them for thei left bare much of her
lovelinesswhil on her dark and abund hair shone a golden circlet
from which rose the royal uraeu and on her arm and bosom sparkl
jewel and necklac
thei meet by plan thought i to myself but it wa not so for see
her kallikr start and turn to fly also he cover hi ey
with hi hand as though to hide her beauti from him she lift her
face like on who plead ye and when he would not hearken caught
him by the hand and drew him into the shadow of the cloister
there thei remain a long while for at thi hour the place wa
desert by all at length thei appear again on the edg of the
shadow and i saw that her arm were about him and that her head rest
on hi breast thei separ she vanish into the shadow and went
her wai while he walk to and fro across the court mutter to
himself like a man who know not what he doe
i came from my place and met him sai
sure you ar troubl priest can it be that the goddess refus
your prayer or is it perchanc that you weari of them and would
still plai the part of a warrior of warrior as you did on the gallei
hapi or but the other dai yonder in the northern marsh if so it
is too late priest for egypt is fallen and all is lost that is
unless like mentor and mani of your race you would sell your sword
to ochu artaxerx
ay prophetess he answer egypt is lost which be a greek
should not troubl me over much and i too am lost i the driven of an
evil fate
speak on it if it pleas you or be silent if it pleas you o
priest what the prophetess hear she tell onli to the mother
then i turn and went back into the shadow of the shrine where i
lean against a pillari rememb that on it wa sculptur the
scene of thoth weigh heart befor osiri here i wait wonder
whether he would follow me or go hi wai
for a while he stood hesit but at length he follow me
prophetess he said hoars i speak under the veil of isi
know that such confess cannot be reveal yet it is hard to
speak sinc the matter ha to do with woman ay and with yourself
most holi prophetess
in isi i have no self i answer
prophetess in bygon year as i think you know i learn to love a
royal maiden on set far abov me and it seem that she love me
that passion brought a brother blood upon my hand as you also
know i fled to the goddess seek peac and forgiv for in me
i think there ar two selv the self of my bodi and the self of my
soul
as in most that breath beneath the sun i answer sigh
i wa bred a soldier on who came from a race of soldier men of
high blood and good to look upon as onc i wa though in thi garb
few would guess it
i have seen you wear warhar and can guess i answer
smile a littl
that soldierself prophetess wa as ar other of the breed i
drank and i revel i bow the knee to aphrodit love women and
for an hour be love i fought not without honour then seek
advanc with my brother i enter the servic of pharaoh and of
that stori doubtless you know the rest
i bow my head and he went on
i came to phila i made confess i took the first vow at night
and alon i wa led to the sanctuari there to see the vision of the
goddess i saw that vision glow in the darken shrine and oh it
wa gloriou
here i start and watch him narrowli wonder how much he knew or
guess
someth took hold of me prophetess for now i beheld her whom all
my soul ador her with whom it would be unit it wa as though a
memori came to me from afar a memori and a promis that power which
took hold of me caus me to bend my head as though to kiss the vision
and therebi pledg my soul to the divin the vision also bent it
head and our lip met and lo her were like to those of mortal
woman yet sweeter far
the mother is mistress of all shape priest yet think not that she
forget the pledg that thu it pleas her to accept from that
moment you were sworn to her and doubtless in a dai to come in thi
form or in that she will claim youshould you remain true to her o
priest
the year pass he went on and true i remain fate brought me
here to memphi and in thi templ i saw you holi prophetess and
learn to worship you from afar not with the bodi but with the
spirit sinc to me you were and ar what the vulgar call you isi
cometoearth and the sight of you ever put me in mind as it doe
todai of that divin vision whose lip met mine in the shrine at
phila perchanc you never knew it but thu with my spirit i
worship you
now i ayesha remain silent lean against the pillar for
weak took hold of me who felt as though i were about to fall yet
and let the veng god write thi to my honouryet i made him no
sign that i wa she who had plai the part of isi in the sanctuari
it is well i said present and doubtless at the appoint hour
the goddess will thank you but what then is your troubl priest to
love a goddess with the spirit is no crime
ay prophetess but what if he who love the goddess with hi spirit
and is sworn to her alon for ever in a vow of perpetu chastiti
should love a woman with hi flesh and thu betrai both heaven and hi
own soul
then priest i answer speak veri low i fear that he is on
whose hope of forgiv is but small yet for those who repent and
deni there is pardon onli thei must deni thei must deni while there
is still time
easi to sai and hard to do he answer at least for him who ha
to deal with on that will not be deni with on who hold hi heart
in the hollow of her hand and crush it with on whose ey ar like
starbeacon to which the wander must fly with on whose breath is
as rose and whose lip ar as honei with on who can drive the
desir of man as a racer drive hi chariot with on to whom oath
also have been sworn such oath as the youth swear to the maid in
the first mad of the flesh decre by those who made it
goddess ar far awai but woman is near moreov among men there
is a law which even a prophetess mai understand which sai that oath
vow with the lip mai not be broken to benefit the vower soul
these ar ancient argument i answer from ag to ag thei echo
from the roof of the templ of aphrodit and of ashtoreth but isi
know them not the flesh is given to mankind that it wearer mai
learn to scorn and trampl it the spirit is given to mankind that it
holder mai learn to rise upon it wing woe to those who choos the
flesh and reject the spirit repent is still possibl and after
it come amend and after amend forgiv
he brood awhil then said
prophetess i repent who abov all thing desir at the endthat end
which again and again i have sought in battl wherev it ha pass
me byto be unit with the goddess shape like the divin on whom
i saw at the shrine of phila ye with her and with no other but how
can i amend who am a lion in a net a net woven of woman hair
now i search him with my ey and learn that although so sore
beset thi man spoke noth but the truth then i answer
the wise bird fli the snare which it see spread in it sight
tomorrow at the dawn noot the holi sail north to meet certain
ambassador of the persian and if he can make term to ransom the
templ of isi from the rage of ochu will you go with him
breath no word of hi purpos or of your if so perchanc thu at
last you shall find that goddess whose lip met your at phila here
or otherwher
he thought awhil then mutter
it is hard veri hard yet i will go i who would satisfi my soul and
not my flesh
as he spoke a tall priestess flit past us pass from shadow into
shadow but think that she wa on of those whose duti it wa to
watch the inner shrine at thi hour i took no note of her nor did
kallikr lost in hi own thought so much as see her
chapter xiv
the beguil of bagoa
that night noot my master came to bid farewel to me
i go north as i have been commandeda to how the command came let
that behop therebi to preserv the templ of our worship and
those who serv in them i know not if i shall return or when and
therefor daughter of my spirit it griev me to part from you in
these troublou time yet the command said that you must not
accompani me but bide here for your comfort learn two thing first
that no harm shall come to you as i have told you befor and
secondli though that hour be far awai even in the flesh we shall
meet again wait then till my word come to you
i bow my head in obedi and ask whether he wa unattend
nai daughter he answer i take with me certain of our
fellowship and among them that greek kallikr who ha ask leav
to accompani me be a man of war as you have seen he mai
perchanc prove of servic upon such a mission how he learn that i
wa go i cannot sai he ad look at me curious
i told him ask no more master
there is littl need i think he answer smile it mai pleas
you to learn he ad bitterli that the traitor who wa pharaoh
fli up nile tomorrow er the dawn alreadi thei lade hi ship with
the chest of egypt treasur mani of them that should have gone to
pai hi soldier and strengthen hi alli
mai the count of them comfort him in hi honour exil among
the ethiopian yet my master i think that he will need to count
quickli unless it pleas the god to send a fals vision to me when
i prophesi in the palac yonder er thi shameless nectaneb gave
the daughter of isi to tene the sidonian
if so ayesha the god sent a fals vision to me also how will he
face them i wonder with the blood of egypt on hi hand and with
what voic will he tell them of their desecr shrine
i know not master yet it wa written that becaus of her apostasi
and sin egypt must fall can the god then be wroth with their own
instrument
noot ponder awhil shake hi head then answer
go ask that question of the sphinx who sit yonder in the sand by the
pyramid of the ancient king brood as the legend sai over the
secret of earth and heaven or he ad slowli when your own dai
ar done ayesha ask it of your soul perchanc then some god will
make clear the riddl of the world below but here on earth it cannot
be answer sinc he who could read it would know all thing and be
himself a god sin must come and to sin sinner ar necessari but
to what sin is necessari i do not know unless it be that from it
good is born at last at least the sinner can plead that he is but an
arrow on the bow of destini and that the arrow must fly where the
shooter aim even though it drink innoc blood widow women and
make children fatherless
mayhap my master it will be answer to thi arrow that it
fashion itself to deal out death that it grew the wood and forg
the barb and bound upon it shaft the feather of desir which wood
had it chosen otherwis here or elsewher might have flourisheda
tree bear fruitsor as season wood shape itself to be a staff
to lean upon or a rod of justic in the hand of king
you ar wise ayesha nor have i instruct you in vain he repli
with a gentl smile yet i repeat when for the last time you watch
the sun sink and your soul prepar to follow it over the edg of the
world then again propound to it thi riddl and hear the answer of
that invis sphinx which brood in the heaven abov on the earth
below and in the breast of everi child it bear
thu he spoke and wave hi hand make an end of that debat nor
have i ever forgotten it or hi word and now when sometim i feel
or hope soon i even i the halfimmort mai see the sun sink for
the last time onc more as noot command i ask thi riddl of the
sphinx that brood within my instruct spirit and wait it answer
for ala and ala how am i better than nectaneb he betrai the
god have i not betrai the god who were nearer to me than ever
thei came to hi coars and glutton soul he shed blood to satisfi
hi rage and lust have i not shed blood and shall i not perchanc
shed more of it befor all is done when my unconquer appetit
ar on me and there is a dear prize that i would win he fled with the
treasur of egypt to wast them in the desert sand have i not fled
with the treasur that were given mewith the jewel crown of my
wisdom with the golden talent of my heapedup learn with the
alabast vessel of my beauti with the perfum of my power and my
eloquencethat drill order and mass togeth and ad to
the greatest gift of all my length of undi dai might have
reform the world and led it into peac
have i ayesha not fled with all these countless splendour clasp
upon my breast and buri them in the wilder as did nectaneb
with egypt wealth befor the barbarian slew him have i not done
these thing becaus of a great desir and becaus rob of that
desir the world i should have guid wa gall to my tongu and
gravel to my teeth yet wa i to blame wa not that blind man i love
to blame who could not see with hi darken fleshi ey the glori
that lai within hi grasp and thu stir my soul to mad wa not
the woman to blame also who darken those ey of hi by art the
evil god had given her
oh i know not perchanc thei too can put up a tale befor the
judgment seat which i shall find it hard to answer for thei too ar
as thei were made or as thei made themselv shape their own
arrow from the wood of circumst that grew i know not where and
now my desir ha drawn near to me again it gleam a glitter
fruit upon the tree of life and i stretch out my hand to pluck it
ye i stand on tipto and almost reach it with my fingertip yet
what if it prove a corrupt what if it crumbl into dust rot by
the great sun of my spirit wither at the finger of my undi
hand
oh my lord hunt upon the mountain after the fashion of men and
aten onc name amenarta sit in her dark beauti in the citi of
the plain and as aforetim plot my ruin and her fleshli theft who
know the end but there within my soul brood the sphinx smile it
immort smile and to it soon or late i must put that question to
which noot the holi and half divin could give no answeror would
not if he could
what of the royal princess amenarta i ask know master that
i grow weari of thi woman
ay daughter these templ court ar wide but not wide enough for
both of you take comfort she sail tomorrow
north i ask
nai south with her father nectaben or so she tell me sai
that hi fortun shall be her own and that togeth thei will reign or
fall
it is well i answer
then we talk of humbl matter that had to do with the shrine of the
goddess and of the hide awai of her treasur lest the persian
should take them when all wa finish noot rose bless me
call on the power abov to protect me and went hi wai in the
ship hapi which he had purchas to bring it to my aid at sidon nor
did i guess that for year i should see him no more yet i think he
knew it well
like a mighti river in it flood the persian host pour down on
memphi as such a torrent sweep awai the villag and the humbl
homestead drown the cattl twist out the palm tree by their
root cover the corn with slime flood citi palac and
templ choke the breath from their inhabit and strew the kind
earth with the corps of those that till it so did ochu and hi
barbarian to egypt rapin and massacr flame of fire and miseri
mark their path men were butcher by the thousand the ag and
women who were no longer fair were driven into the desert to starv
ye it wa the sport of those persian to drive them like game to
where there wa no water and then watch them die of thirst beneath
the burn sun onli the young women were spare to be concubin or
slave and the flower of the children to be put to vile purpos the
citi and the templ were pillag their citizen tortur to drag
from them the secret of the hidingplac of treasur the priest
were forc to sacrific to the god of fire and to spit upon their own
or die the priestess were burn or defil or both
so piti wa the case of egypt that although i knew that by her sin
and faithless she had brought these woe upon herself i who by my
work at sidon had becom on of the appoint minist of her
destruct my heart wept for her and i prai the aveng god to
hold their hand also i prai them to give ochu to drink of hi own
cup and to make of me the butler who mix hi wine nor did i prai in
vain
thu the red ochu came at length to memphi the whitewal citi
the ancient the holi and fill it street with horror till thei
were spread thick with dead and on wail of woe went up to heaven yet
he did not burn the place perchanc becaus our prayer avail and
the god relent perchanc becaus he wish to keep it to be the
seat of hi majesti onli here as elsewher he sack the templ and
wrought sacrileg
from the pylon top of the templ of isi that overlook the court of
that of ptah and the gild stabl of the bull api with my own ey
i saw the persian for in thi busi the greek would have no
hand drag out the sacr beast whom thei held to be a god of the
egyptian though in truth he wa but the emblem of the god or rather
of the gener power that is in natur and butcher it with jeer
and mockeri more their scullion came and cook the sacr flesh
after which at tabl spread in the inner court ochu and hi
captain at it forc the priest of ptah to tast of their own
god and to drink of the liquor in which it had been seeth thei
were coward those priest or sure thei would have found mean to
mix the broth with poison
after the feast when all the revel were drunk with wine a great
jackass wa brought and the statu of the god have been thrown out
of it wa stabl in the sanctuari
such were some of the thing that were done in memphi and inde
throughout egypt for as api wa serv so wa the holi ram of
mend moreov other thing were done too shame to record
now all thi while i sat in the templ of isi await what might
befal i will not sai that i wa unafraid becaus i wa afraid yet
within me wa that proud spirit which forbad me to show my fear
moreov within me also burn a certain fire of faith whereof the
light wa my guid in the dark of despair the holi noot my
master had told me that i and those with me should take no harm and
i would not doubt my master moreov when i prai at night a voic
from heaven speak in my heart seem to command me to be brave
sinc there fought for me and mine those whom i could not see
so there i sat quit alon with none to counsel me and none to help
me give courag as best i could to those poor priest and
priestess my fellow servant of the goddess the worship of the
templ went on as befor each morn the statu of the mother wa
deck and dress the perfum were pour the offer were made
the process wound round the court preced by the singer and the
shaker of the sistrum while at night the holi hymn were chant
to the star
the persian came to know of these thing and gather at the gate
amaz
who ar these thei ask who have no fear
but we answer noth though death stare us in the face
the matter reach the ear of ochu and stir hi wonder so that
in the end he came in person to visit the templ i receiv him in
the great hall veil and seat in a chair of state that wa set at
the foot of a statu of the goddess with him were sundri of hi great
lord dress in silk and perfum also the gener mentor whom i
had known at sidon where he plai traitor desert with hi greek
to the persian further there wa present bagoa the eunuch and first
councillor of the king of king who command hi armi also like all
these unfortun a fat shrillvoic man with a smooth and furtiv
manner who wave hi long hand to and fro when he spoke
now thi bagoa wa by birth egyptian so i had heard and my first
sight of him confirm the tale ye without doubt by birth he wa an
egyptian of the smallbon largeei roundhead type that had
descend from the ancient blood as i knew by the statu of mani
that i have seen taken from the earliest tomb befor it becam the
custom to embalm the dead i note thi and at onc a thought came to
me
would an egyptian desir to see the sanctuari of isi and her priest
desecr and destroi perchanc he did not worship ptah or api
or other of the god but all born upon the nile vener mother
isi the queen of heaven and bow to her sovereignti that wa a
faith which whereer thei wander and upon whatev altar thei
burn incens thei never could forget becaus through a hundr
gener it came down to them with their blood yet who knew thi
bagoa it wa said wa a cun fellow steep in murder who from
hi crime had reap a rich reward and such an on look onli to
hi dai of glori might forget even isi and the wrath to come
ochu looselip cruelfac and wearyei wear a look of
pride that yet wa full of haunt terror such as ar ever the
companion of murder who know that in a dai unborn sure
themselv thei will be murder stood befor me i rise from my
chair made obeis to the king of kingsand had he but known it
cast the curs of isi at him from beneath my veil
what is thi he ask speak in greek in the thick voic of on
who ha drunk well at the feast and point at me with hi sceptr
is it on of those wrap bodi that we drag from the tomb such
as we us for the cook of the god api broil him with hi own
worshipp nai for it move and talk and seem to have the shape
of a woman bagoa strip that veil thing nake that we mai see
whether it be a woman and if so of what favour
now when i ayesha heard thi at onc all my courag came back to
me as ever it doe when peril get me by the throat at onc i laid
my plan which wa short and simpl
if that eunuch so much as advanc to lai a finger on me i would draw
the knife that hung to my girdl the curv razoredg arab knife
that had been my father and thrust him asid i would spring
past him and strike it through the heart of yonder king of king
send him to sum up hi account with isi then if there were time
i would serv bagoa in the same wai and afterward if must be us
the knife upon myself better thu than that i should be shame befor
these barbarian
i spoke no word and my face wa hid yet i think that out of my soul
sprang someth which warn these two of their danger or perchanc
it wa my guardian spirit that warn them at the least bagoa went
down upon hi knee and bow till hi forehead touch the ground
o king of king he said i prai thee command not thy slave to do

when the man had gone i ayesha laugh aloud i who had plai a

chapter xv
the plot and the voic
the weari year went by ochu return to persia bear hi spoil
with him and leav on sabaco a brutal fellow to rule egypt and
wring tribut from her
all thi while i ayesha sat alon quit alon in the templ of
isi at memphi whose wall i never left for the command of ochu wa
obei and whatev happen to those of other god the shrine of
isi wa left inviol here then surround by a dwindl compani
of priest and priestess i remain as noot my master had
command me to do await a word that never came and carri on
the ceremoni of the templ in such humbl fashion as our poverti
allow
what did i through all that slow and heavi time i dream i commun
with heaven abov i studi the ancient lore of egypt and of other
land grow ever wiser and full of knowledg as a newfil jar
with perfum or with wine yet of what us wa thi knowledg to me
as it seem of none yet it wa not so sinc my heart fed on it
like a bee upon it winter store of honei and without it i should
have di as the bee must die moreov now i understand that thi
space of wait wa a prepar for those long centuri which
afterward i wa doom to pass in the tomb of kor it wa a train
and a disciplin of the soul
thu forgotten of the world i brood and endur i who had thought
to rule the world
so moon ad itself to moon and still fill with a divin
patienc i abod within those templ wall till the appoint hour
which i knew would dawn at last of nectaneb i heard noth he had
vanish awayi doubt not to the doom which i had foreseen of
amenarta hi daughter i heard noth she also had vanish awai
as i suppos with him of kallikr the soldier priest i heard
noth doubtless he wa dead and that beauti of hi had turn to
evilodour dust as my own must do a thought from which i shrank
much i wonder why thi man alon upon the earth should have stir
my soul and awaken the long of my woman flesh i knew not
unless it wa agre that when the gate were pass i should meet him
in a world that li beyond if such there were for from the
begin i wa sure that it had been laid upon me to lift up hi
spirit to the level of my own perchanc becaus in some faroff star
or state i had sin against it and him and drag them down
inde is not thi the common lot of the great that with toil and
tear and bitter disappoint thei must strive to draw the spirit
of other to that high peak upon which themselv thei stand and
amongst all the sin of our vile condit is there on blacker than
to cast back some soul that struggl toward the pure and good into
the seeth depth of ill
thu in those dai i thought of that lost kallikr whose lip
alon had touch my own i thought too with a sad wonder how
strang it wa that i to whose feet men had crept by score i the
most beauti of women and the most learn had been reject or at
the least turn from by thi man the favour of anoth who
although she wa fair and bold of heart still shone with a smaller
light as doe the pale moon when compar with the glori of the sun
inde now that all wa over and done as i believ and that nought
remain of these fire of folli save a pinch of burntout ash i
smile to myself as i rememb them yet to tell truth i smile
sadli who here alon at the dear feast of love which to a woman
mean more than all other feast had been serv with the cup of
defeat and shame by the grin varlet destini yet i wa well
serv for what had i wisdom daughter the vow to etern glori
to do with such matter of our common flesh
oh i wa glad to have done with the grayei kallikr who could
wield a sword so manlywel in battl and yet when remors took hold
of him could prai with the best of priest now at least onc more i
wa the mistress of my own soul with leisur to shape it to the
like of the god and in those dai of holi contempl truli
it wing beat against their bar struggl to be free would that
thei had burst them but fate had built that cage too strong
at length new came to me for isi still had ey and ear in egypt
and all that these saw or heard i learn new that ochu grown
timid or weari in hi persian palac had determin onc more to
drink the water of the nile or perchanc to check the account of
hi satrap sabaco whose sum of tribut had fallen off of late
so he came with all hi eastern pomp and at last took up hi abod in
the palac of memphi within two bowshot of the templ where i dwelt
the peopl receiv him with rejoic it wa piti to see them
deck themselv and the street with flower spread branch of
palm for him to tread on and fly banner from the lofti top of
the firescorch pylonsslav welcom their tortur and tyrant
and grin to hide the terror in their heart he came and there
wa festiv throughout the great town as though osiri had return
to earth accompani by all the lesser god
onli in the templ of isi there wa none no palm leav deck it
stark and ancient wall no bonfir burn within it court and no
lantern hung in it windowplac not thu would i ayesha bow the
knee to baal or sacrific to moloch though it is true that some of my
servant look askanc when i forbad it and ask who would protect
us from the wrath of the king of king becaus of thi neglect of hi
command
the goddess will protect us i answer or if she doe not i
will and sent them to their task
on the second night after the come of ochu bagoa wait on me and
i command that he should enter but alon so hi eastern rabbl of
gorgeou servitor wa turn back from the gate and he came in
unattend splendid in goldembroid silk and jewel where he had
left me there i receiv him seat veil in the chair of state
befor the alabast statu of the goddess at the entranc to the
outer sanctuari that overlook the great hall
hail bagoa i said how goe it with you ha that amulet of
power which i gave to you protect you from harm
prophetess he answer bow it ha protect me it ha lift
me up so that now save for the king of king my master most august
he ad with a sneer in everi word i am now the greatest on in the
whole world i give life i decre death i lift up i cast down
satrap and councillor crawl about my feet gener beg my favour
gold is shower upon me yea i might build my hous of gold there
is nought left for me to desir beneath the sun
except certain thing to which thank to the cruelti of the king of
king or those who went befor him you cannot attain for exampl
children to inherit all thi glori and all thi gold bagoa although
you live among so mani of those who might be mother
he heard and hi face that i note had grown thinner and more fierc
sinc last i saw him becam like to that of the devil
prophetess he hiss sure you ar on who know how to pour
acid into an open wound
that therebi it mai be cleans bagoa
yet your word ar true he went on unheed all thi splendour
all thi wealth and power i would give and gladli to be as my
father were befor me gentli bred but humbl owner of a patch of
land between thebe and phila there thei sat for a score of
gener with their women and their children but where thank to
the persian ar my woman and my children in the western cliff
yonder there is a sepulchr in the chapel of that sepulchr abov the
coffin of those who lie beneath is an imag of him who dug it he
live some fourteen hundr year ago in the dai of aahm he who
won back egypt from the hykso king the invad who held it as the
persian do todai for he wa on of the captain of the troop of
aahm who when he conquer gave him that patch of land in guerdon
for hi servic
here bagoa paus like to on overwhelm by unhappi memori then
continu
from ag to ag prophetess it ha been the custom for the children
of the children of thi soldier upon a certain dai to make offer
to that statu wherein as we hold dwell the ka of him whose face
and form it pictur to set a golden crown that of osiri upon it
head to wind a golden chain about it neck to give it food to give
it flower such is the sacr duti from gener to gener of
the descend of that captain who serv aahm and help to free
egypt from the barbarian foe myself i have fulfil that duti ay
when ochu the destroy first came to memphi i travel up nile
and place the crown upon the head and wound the chain about the neck
and offer the flower and the food but prophetess of thi blood i
am the last for becaus of my beauti as a child the persian seiz me
and made of me a dry tree so that never again will there be on to
make offer in the tomb of my forefath the captain of aahm or
to read the stori of hi deed that fourteen hundr year ago while
yet live he caus to be record upon hi funer tablet
i heard and laugh
a common tale i said a veri common tale in egypt todai the
egypt of the persian as doubtless it wa long ago in the egypt of
the hykso but thi ancestor of your wa a man who smote or help
to smite the hykso and live to write hi gloriou deed on stone to
be an exampl to those who came after him well the stori is
finish is it not inde i wonder that the gloriou bagoa slave
of the persian bagoa with hi pomp and pleasur think fit to
wast time upon the tale of a forgotten warrior who in hi hour struck
for freedom what ar the flower and the humbl scent which for more
than a thousand year have been offer to the spirit of that warrior
but now can never be offer again sinc there ar none of hi blood
left to bring them compar to the priceless balm the jewel and
the gold that daili ar pour upon the feet of bagoa the chief
eunuch and counsellor of the king of king who did he know of those
holi on that sleep in the tomb of the race of bagoa doubtless
would drag them out and caus bagoa the last of it blood to fire
them that he might see a merri blaze that would be a good sport for
the king of king to forc the great bagoa to burn hi ancestor and
on their bone to cook a royal meal as he forc the priest of ptah
to broil api for hi feast
the mighti bagoa heard and understood me as i could see well for at
everi word he winc like a highbr steed beneath the whip
ceas he said hoars ceas i can bear no more why do you rub
sand into my ey prophetess
to clear awai their rheum that thei mai see the better bagoa but
let us be done with the tale of that honour longlost ancestor of
your to whose spirit no more offer will be made and tell me of
the wonder of the great estat of you in whom run hi blood the
last drop of it that soon will be suck up in the sand of death
seal that sepulchr bagoa but first set it in anoth write
graven on a tablet of emerald or gold tell how he who hallow it
wa by the god given the glori of be the far forefath of bagoa
chief eunuch of the king of king ochu who burn the shrine of
that forefath god
ceas ceas he moan the hour is at hand
what hour bagoa
the hour of vengeanc which i swore to isi
doe the egyptian worshipp of the persian holi fire rememb hi
vow to isi be plain bagoa
hearken prophetess dure all these year i have been seek
opportun now of a sudden i see it to my hand a thought came to me
whilst you talk of the captain of aahm to whom no more of hi
blood can make offer
speak it then bagoa
prophetess the king of king is wrath with you becaus alon of all
the great place in memphi on the templ of isi no welcom
banner hang to greet him at hi royal come and becaus no priest or
priestess of isi spread flower befor hi conquer feet so wrath
is he that were it not for hi oath which he fear to break he
would pull thi sanctuari stone from stone slaughter it priest and
give it priestess to the soldier
is it so i ask indiffer
ay prophetess but by that oath you ar save for ever i keep it
befor hi mind and warn him of the fate of those who do violenc to
the queen of heaven onli thi morn i did thi while he stood
stare at these unbann wall and mutter vengeanc
and what said he then bagoa
he laugh and answer that he would do the goddess not violenc
but honour thu on the third night from thi the night of full
moon he will make a great feast in the inner court of thi templ at
that feast the king of king and hi women will sit upon a platform
laid over the coffin of the royalti of egypt drag from their
sepulchr so that it king and queen mai be beneath hi feet thi
platform will be support by the statu of the god of egypt which
onc thei worship in front of it will burn the holi fire of persia
and that fire will be fed with the mortal remnant of priest and
priestess of these egyptian god ochu the king will be clad in the
robe of osiri and at the end of the feast from behind her
consecr statu that befor which we sit the goddess herself
dress in the robe of isi and wear the holi emblem upon her
head will appear veil led by priestess or by royal persian
women you will be that goddess prophetess
and then i ask
then you will be brought up on to the platform and there thi new
osiri will unveil you embrac you as hi wife in welcom befor
all that compani thi he will do to make a mock of you becaus he
believ you to be an ancient woman who goe veil to hide her
bald and her wrinkl for so the rumour run among the persian
now when i ayesha heard these terribl word and my heart understood
the height and depth of the sacrileg which thi mad king would dare
and all that it might mean to me i trembl ye the bone seem to
melt within me so that almost i fell from the throne whereon i sat
yet gather up my strength i ask
is thi all bagoa
nai at that feast prophetess i myself as vizier and the head of
the world under him must serv ochu as hi cupbear while the
priest of osiri and the priestess of isi sing the ancient chant
of the awaken of osiri from the tomb and of hi reunion with isi
the wife divin it will be my part to hand the jewel goblet fill
with the holi wine to osirisochu king of heaven and earth from it
he will drink the marriagedraught and have drunk will pour the
dreg of the goblet upon your feet or for aught i know will cast them
in your face nai i forgot first the persian women of the royal
household will strip the cover from you that osiri mai see hi
longlost bride and the compani mai have sport jeer at her
wither ag
and if she should prove to remain unwith if even she should
chanc to be pass fair what then bagoa
then perchanc prophetess it is in the mind of ochu to add isi to
the number of hi queen think thu to gain the favour of the
egyptian if not of their god oh prophetess you ar veri wise as
all know yet onc your foot slippedor rather your hand slip
when in bygon dai you stretch it out to touch the sceptr of the
king of king ochu ha often spoken of the beauti of that hand and
arm and of how more than all thing he desir to see the face
abov them and the form of which thei ar a part perchanc
prophetess that is why he plan all thi mummeri
and if i refus to act thi plai what then bagoa
then sinc the command is law and design to honour the goddess
the great king oath is at an end then the templ of isi will be
sack and burn like other then her priest will be murder
unless thei make offer to the holi fire and her priestess be
enslav or find a home in the soldier tent or persian household
bagoa i said rise and stand over him know that the curs
of isi hover about your head show me a path out of thi troubl or
you dienot tomorrow or next year but at onc how it matter not
still you die and for the rest ar the sidonian the onli on who
can fire their templ and perish in them
he cring befor me after the fashion of hi unhappi kind then
answer
i wait for such word prophetess and had i not been prepar
against them never would i have enter these gate alon did i not
tell you that at thi feast i shall be the king cupbear now he
went on in a whisper i add that hi own physician who is in my pai
will mix the marriag wine that hi life is in the hollow of my hand
that the guard and captain ar my servant that the great lord ar
sworn to me and that the hour for which i have wait through long
year ha come at last ladi you ar not the onli on who desir
vengeanc upon ochu
fine word i said but how know i that thei will be fulfil in
egypt bagoa is call the king liar
i swear it by isi and if i fail you mai the devour take my
soul
and i who am her mouth and oracl swear by isi that if you fail me
i will take your blood ay though i die a thousand will live on to
aveng me and the dagger or the shaft of on of them shall reach your
heart at last or if thei miss their aim then the goddess herself will
smite
i know it prophetess and i will not fail after drink of that
cup sleep will fall upon the king of king ye the new osiri will
return to hi tomb and sleep sound but not in the arm of isi
then for a while there wa silenc between us till at length i
motion to him to begon
the night of the feast came and all wa prepar i did not trust
bagoa and therefor i made a plan a splendid and terribl plan i
determin to offer all those feaster ye the king of king with
hi women hi gener hi chamberlain hi councillor and hi
compani as on vast sacrific to the outrag god of egypt and with
them if need were myself and my servant to guid them upon the road
to hell
beneath that hall of the templ which ochu had appoint for the
feast wa a vast vault for the storag of oil and fuel against time
of want or tumult thi vault as it chanc wa full to the roof
sinc in those troublou dai i never knew from moon to moon when the
place might be besieg also in it wa much prepar papyru with
mani written roll that for centuri had been hidden there great
weight of bitumen such as the embalm us a stack of coffin
prepar by the live to receiv their bodi at the end and lastli
hundr of bundl of dri reed that serv to strew the court
what more wa need save to open the air shaft to the hall abov
that the flame might find full plai and to set in the vault on who
could be trust with a lamp of which the light wa hidden command
at a certain signal to cast it among the oilsoak reed and fly
as it chanc such an instrument wa to my hand an old fierc
heart woman in whom ran royal blood for that hard on seventi year
had serv as priestess of thi templ
that veri night i summon the priest and priestess who remain
and in the sanctuari under the wing of isi i told them all told
them how i purpos to sweep thi human dirt of persian with the red
bosom of destruct out of the compani of the live over the edg of
the world into the aveng everlast jaw
thi band of the faith hearken and bow their cowl head then
the first of them an old priest ask
is it decre that we must eat fire with these swine if so we ar
readi
nai i answer the secret passag that run from the back of the
sanctuari of the ruin templ of osiri will be unbar that
passag by which in the old dai the holi effigi of osiri wa brought
at the great festiv of the resurrect to be laid upon the breast
of isi by thi passag at the first sign of fire you must flee as
i will if i mai but if i come not you will know that the goddess ha
call me at the waterstep of the templ of osiri boat will be
wait man by brother of our faith in the dark and the
tumult those boat will pass down nile to the secret shrine that is
call isisamongthere where onc the legend tell the
goddess found the heart of osiri hidden there by typhon the shrine
upon the isl that none dare visit no not even the persian becaus
it is guard by the ghost of the dead or by spirit sent from the
underworld fashion like flame of fire thither fly and there lie
hid until the word of isi come to you as come it will
again thei bow their cowl head in the gloomi sanctuari lit by a
singl lamp then the old priest said
great is the deed that we shall do and worthi sure the song of it
shall echo through all the court of heaven and the god themselv
shall crown our brow with splendour yet er it is decre o
prophetess inspir let us seek a sign from the queen immort that
such is her command
ay i answer let us seek a sign
so there in the half dark we chant the mystic ritual hand in

of a heathen hord but thei bore more than thi sinc around and
between them and the platform upon which stood thi tabl were laid
the coffin of longdead king or queen and other great on torn
it wa said from the pyramid or their surround tomb dark with
the dust of ag there thei lai some of them uncov so as to
reveal the grim shape that slept within
abov these again wa place the wide platform carpet with purpl
cloth of tyre and on it stood the board and gild furnitur of the
feast here too wa a golden throne at the back of which wa a
peacock fan of jewel while to it front wa set a tabl fashion of
black wood inlaid with ivori and around it other smaller throne and
tabl these were the seat of the king of king and some of hi
favour women
nor wa thi all for in an outer court but within the pylon gate
cook and scullion had built fire whereon thei dress meat and
butler set out their store of wine never befor within the memori
of man had so strang and rich a feast been seen in egypt as that
which wa now prepar in the court of isi to defil which with
the smell of flesh wa a sacrileg and the eat of it there an
abomin
when the sun had turn toward the west came bagoa with other eunuch
and chamberlain and be admit to the inner court summon our
compani and issu hi command as to the ceremoni that we must
keep we hearken meekli sai that we were the slave of the king
of king we and our goddess togeth and in all thing would obei

whisper in my ear
be not afraid prophetess all is well and the end shall be good
i am not afraid eunuch i answer who know that all is well and
that the end will be good
the night fell great flare of light set upon stand of bronz were
lit adown the hall and with them countless lamp place at interv
along the tabl the feaster gather thei came by score and
hundr persian lord in their rich robe gener and captain in
their armour merchant of mani land egyptian apost and i know
not who besid men all of them whom it pleas the king of king
to honour thei were marshal in their appoint place by the
steward and butler and there wait in silenc or speak onli in
low voic
from behind the curtain of the outer sanctuari i and my compani
watch it all these were clad in their festal garment of white
garland with flower but i accord to command wore the gloriou
robe of isi beneath my veil and on my head the vultur cap of isi
the golden uraeu the ear and the crescent of the moon moreov
about my bosom were hung the sacr necklac and the other jewel
emblem of the goddess while in my hand i held the sistrum and the
cross of life
trumpet blew announc the advent of the king of king up the long
hall he march clad in the mummi wrap of osiri somewhat
widen at the feet so that he might walk in them wear on hi head
the tall feather crown and hold in hi hand the crook of
dominion and the scourg of rule hi chamberlain and great offici
led him by a stairwai to the platform that wa built abov the bodi
of ancient king where wa set a tini altar upon which burn the
holi persian fire there for a while he stood in pride wave the
scourg with which he flog the world while all that compani fell
upon their face and ador him as a god after which thei lai still
as corps in the grave
it wa strang to see them ly on their face like dead men who
inde soon were to be dead everi on of them and ador thi human
imag thi dressedup doll fashion in their own like to be
the playth of the god and about to be broken by them and cast upon
the rubbish heap of time
i ayesha watch through the veil and aliv with that spirit which
in the hour of great event come to such as i am thought it veri
strang so strang that i could have laugh for there in thi mime
thi puppet king upon the platform with the tame tiger bagoa that
wa about to tear out hi throat crouch at hi feet i saw the
veri type of all grandeur that is built of clai and not of spirit
sinc assuredli there is on grandeur of the earth and anoth of the
spirit whether by the poison of bagoa or by the fire of isi yonder
man who stood triumph over the mighti monarch that lai coffin
beneath hi feet like a windfil toad upon a consecr altar
wa about to die and then what of hi triumph and what of hi pomp
hi cup of blood wa full and when the blast of doom overturn it
into the sand of death what tongu would it take i wonder in
which to urg a million trembl accus against hi trembl
soul lastli what mock devil had persuad him to don the robe of
osiri that in them he might do insult to isi who whateer she mai
not be at least under her royal name of natur is the mighti vassal
of the most high forget that osiri is the god of death and that
isisnatur ever aveng herself upon those who violat her law
littl wonder then that i who laugh but seldom in those dai did so
in my heart while my ey took their fill of the tinsel panopli of
thi lost madman
ochusosiri wave hi sceptr and the seem dead who lai around
him as thei had been drill to do by those who plan thi plai
came to life in a grim mockeri of ghost call from the grave thei
rose up and each accord to hi degre took hi place at thi
tabl of osiri brought to earth
the feast went on thei at much thei drank more till their brain
were bemus with wine and scarc could thei stand upon their feet at
length the climax came the copingston wa set upon thi black
pyramid of mortal sin against the spirit of divin
ochu rose wave the crook of dominion
osiri is risen again in egypt he cri let hi wife the divin
isi be brought forth that he mai drink with her the cup of marriag
and embrac her as her husband
thereon that ribald compani shout
yea the god osiri is risen again in egypt bring out queen isi
bring her out that we mai see her drink with him and be kiss
guard summon us we came forth from the curtain sanctuari white
robe in simpl state sing the ancient hymn of reunion to the
music of harp and of shaken sistra our compani came forth into the
great hall i at the head of them we walk into the hall a solemn
troop at whom the drunken feaster forgot to mock inde some of them
bow their head as though in aw we came to the dai that wa
support by the statu of the god of egypt and platform with her
ancient royalti and here we halt guard led me up a stairwai so
that i stood upon the platform face ochusosiri he spoke sai
mockingli
hail queen of heaven behold osiri rearisen on the nile ha found
you at last unveil queen of heaven that he mai look upon your
glori for as goddess do not grow old doubtless you ar gloriou
at these word of insult the compani broke into coars laughter i
wait till it had di awai then answer
o king wrap in the robe of a greater king yea in the robe of
death have you not heard that it is veri danger to draw the veil
of isi that none inde ha drawn it and live you think me but a
woman but know that here in the shrine of isi ay here in her holi
hous which you desecr with revel and with the flesh of
butcher beast i her prophetess and oracl am the veri goddess
and cloth with her divin i prai you therefor think again er
you bid me to draw my veil
for a moment he seem to grow afraid as did that compani for thei
were silent then rage took hold of him who wa full of wine and
pride
what he shout am i the king of the world to be defi and
threaten by an old hag who call herself a priestess or a goddess
or both woman onc befor i listen to your prayer and left you
wrap in that rag but now when i come both as your king and as your
god why i claim the privileg of the god off with that veil or i
will bid my women strip you stark
again the silenc fell and for a littl while i look about me i
look at the feaster illumin by the strong flare of the essenc
of bitumen i look at the blue heaven abov in which the great moon
float royal i turn and look at the white statu of the
goddess show faint and pure between the curtain in the dark of
the distant shrine beyond then i lift my head and prai aloud
sai

earth o thou great spirit of the world whom men name isi thou that
canst spare thou that canst aveng thou that knowest both life and
death thou that rulest heart and destini thou to whose equal

chapter xvii
the flight and the summon
we gain the hidden passag bear with us the treasur and the
holi book of the sanctuari that to thi dai lie buri in the cave
of kor we came safe to the ruin templ of osiri that the
persian had destroi and through it to the waterg where the
boat wait none note us we embark upon the boat and glide
awai down nile if ani saw us pass thei thought us countryfolk or
perchanc egyptian who fled from the persian in memphi but i think
that none did see us sinc all ey were bent upon the flame templ
of isi and all ear were fill with the rumour that fled from mouth
to mouth tell that the goddess had descend in fire and made an
end of the tyrant ochu hi gener hi councillor and hi court
thu did i bid farewel to whitewal memphi which never again my
ey should see though often my spirit show it to me in vision of
the night and often i seem to hear the last wild agoni of those upon
whom i execut the decre of heaven
what happen afterward of that i know littl though rumour which
philo brought in the later year told me that bagoa and the physician
let fall or flung awai the corps of ochu these rumour said that it
wa found devour by cat and jackal so that had it not been for
the rent osiri wrap none would have known that here lai all
that wa left of the king of king who desol egypt and made her a
widow thei told also that bagoa set ars the son of ochu upon
the throne of persia and later poison him and all hi children save
on then it seem that he made dariu king and thi dariu
codamannu know that bagoa would poison him also smote the
first forc him to drink of the drug cup that he had given to so
mani
such it appear wa the end of bagoa whom i us as the artist us
a tool har him to the chariot of my wrath and like the
erinny of the greek make of him a sword wherewith i or heaven
work through me stab persia to the heart as through tene i
had stab sidon and through sidon egypt for such were the doom
that i wa command to bring about thu bagoa walk the road down
which aforetim he drove hi victim and save for an evil name that
echo through the ag thi wa the end of him and all hi crime
er dawn our compani came to the great reedb and through it by
channel known onli to our pilot reach the secret shrine name
isisamongthere where all had been made readi for our come
by the priest who watch there worn out as well i might be i laid
me down and slept in a tini cell fear no harm sinc i knew sure
that none would come to me or to those with me why i knew it i cannot
sai but it wa so i knew further that i had done with egypt my work
there wa finish henceforth we were divorc
all that dai i slept and through most of the night which follow
lull by the whisper of the tall surround reed i suppos
that it must have been dure those night hour that i dream a
strang dream in it i stood upon the desert a vast wast of sand
border in the distanc by the nile i wa alon in thi desert save
for the sun that sank in the west and the moon that rose in the east
and between them shone upon by sun and moon by ra and by isi
crouch a mighti sphinx of stone with a woman breast and head
which sphinx i knew wa egypt there she sat immemori unchang
stern beauti and stare with brood ey toward the east whenc
morn by morn aros the sun
appear befor her on by on each adorn with it own sacr
emblem all the god of egypt a grim fantast crowd such as a
brain distraught might fashion in it mad beasthead and human
shape humanhead and beastshap dog and hawk crocodil and
owl swampbird bull ram and swollenbelli dwarf came thi
rout of god and bow befor the stern and beauteou sphinx that wore
a woman head
the sphinx open it mouth and spoke
what would ye of me who have shelter you for long it ask
on shape like a man but from whose shoulder rose the beak head of
an ibi crown with a crescent moon on which stood a feather and
hold in hi hand the palett of a scribe he whom the egyptian
name thoth the measur the record stood forward and made answer
we would bid thee farewel mother egypt our shelter for thousand
upon thousand of year out of thy mud we were creat into thy mud
we return again
is it so answer the sphinx well what of it your short dai is
done yet tell me who gave you these monstrou shape and who name
you god
the priest gave them to us and the priest name us god answer
the ibishead man now the priest ar slain and we perish with the
priest becaus we ar but god made of thy mud o egypt
then get you gone back into the mud ye god of mud but first tell
me where is my spirit that in the begin when the world wa
young i sent forth that it might be a soul divin to rule egypt and
the world
we know not answer thoth the record ask it of the priest who
made us perchanc thei have hidden it awai farewel o egypt
farewel o sphinx farewel farewel
farewel echo all that monstrou throng and then fade miser
awai
there wa silenc and with it solitud the sphinx stare at
nothing and nothing stare at the sphinx and i the watcher
watch at length out of the nothing aros someth and it
shape wa the shape of woman it stood befor the sphinx and said
behold me i am thy lost spirit but thou o egypt didst not creat
me for i creat thee by a divin command i am she whom men know as
isi here upon the nile but whom all the world and all the world
beyond the world know as natur the visibl garment of the almighti
god gone ar those phantasi mannurtur and priestconceiv yet
i remain and thou remainest ay and though we be call by mani
name in the infinit dai to come as we have been call in the
infinit dai that ar gone ever shall we remain until thi littl
float globe of earth ceas from it journei and melt back
into that from which it came the infinit arm of the infinit god
then the humanhead sphinx rose from the rock whereon it had laid
from the begin it rear it giant bulk it went upon it knee
and bow to the womanshap the tini womanshap that wa isi that
wa natur that wa the executrix of god thrice it bowedand
vanish
the spirit wa left and i ayesha wa left the spirit turn and
look on me and lo to my sight it wa shape as i am shape sadli
it look with griev ey but never a word it spoke
mother my mother i call speak to me my mother
but never a word it answer onli it point to the ski and
suddenli wa gone then i ayesha i stood alon in the immeasur
desert look at the set sun look at the rise moon look
at the even star that shone between and wept and wept and wept
becaus of my loneli for what compani is there for a human soul
in sun and moon and even star when the spirit that form it and
them ha depart leav them to gaze on upon the other voiceless
in the void
such wa my dream upon which i have ponder from year to year ask
an answer to it riddl from sun and moon and even star and
find none onli the spirit can interpret it own problem and to
me becaus of my sin becaus like the god of egypt i am fashion
of mud that veil my soul dim lamp within as yet that spirit is
choke and dumb still on dai the nile of death that i have dam
from me for so long will burst it barrier and wash awai the mud
then the lamp will shine out again then the spirit will come and
refresh it with it holi oil and breath upon it with it breath and
in that breath perchanc i shall understand my dream and learn the
answer to it riddl
inde alreadi time lai it foundat bare for doe not holli tell
me that for nigh upon two thousand year her god have been dead in
egypt for awhil thei linger on beneath the greek and roman
chang mask of what onc thei were for awhil their effigi were
still paint upon the coffin of her peopl then the star of a new
faith rose a bright and holi star and in it beam thei wither and
crumbl into dust onli the old sphinx remain stare at the nile
and mayhap in the silenc of the night hold commun with isi the
mother tell of dead king and war forgot for be natur
self isi alon can never die although from ag to ag her vestment
chang
yea when i ayesha fire the hall and burn those foul persian
feaster with them i slew the god of egypt and their sad and solemn
statu stare a farewel to me through that waver wall of flame
nai it wa not i who did it nor wa it i who brought it doom on
sidon and hi death on ochu but destini that us me as it sword
as i us bagoa me fate doomdriven daughter
when i awok it wa still dark save for the light of the sink moon
and in the nightwind with a faint continu voic the tall reed
whisper their prayer to heaven for though we know it not all that
ha life must prai or die from the great star rush through space
on it etern journei to the humblest flower nestl beneath a
stone everyth must prai for prayer is the blood of the spirit
that is in them and if that blood freez then thei ar resolv to
matter that cannot grow and know neither hope nor fear is lost in
the blind gulf of dark
i hearken to those whisper reed tell of the mysteri below
to the mysteri abov and on the wing of their sweet petit
sent up my own to heaven
for in truth i wa troubl and knew not what to do here i could not
bide for long sinc sure soon or late the persian would seek me
out and sure bagoa to cover hi own crime would slai me as the
destroy of hi king thi did not affright me who wa weari of the
world with all it horror and in a mood to walk the gate of death
hope that beyond it i might find a better but there were those with
me my fellow servant to whom i had sworn safeti and who put their
faith in me as though in truth i were the goddess herself and if i
di certainli thei would die also
therefor i must save them if i could yet how i had no ship in which
to flee from egypt and if it were to hand whither should i fly now
that all the earth wa persian oh that noot were here to counsel me
that he live somewher i wa sure sinc had not hi voic spoken in
the shrine and thi by no priestli trick for when i put up that
prayer for guidanc i knew not how it would be answer or by whom
or if inde it would but fall upon the deaf ear of the wind and
like a dead leaf in their breath be blown awai and lost
ye he still live yet how could i know that it wa here he live
mayhap he spoke from far beyond thi stormi air of earth even so he
who had counsel me onc might counsel me again
o whisper reed i cri in my heart with all your million
tongu prai east and west and north and south that ayesha in her
need mai be help of the wisdom of the holi noot
ye thu i prai like a littl bewild child who see god in a
cloud and think that flower open for her joi and that the great
pleiad look down from the sky and love her ye toil and grief and
terror had made me like a littl child
well it is to such rather than to the proud and learn the ruler
of the earth and the challeng of heaven that answer oftenest come
and with them knowledg of the truth at least to me empti of
strength and wisdom and in that weak hour forget even of my
beauti my great deed and the lore that i had won swiftli there
came an answer
of a sudden at the first blush of dawn upon night pale cheek a
priestess stood by my pallet
awak o isiscometoearth she said bow a man stand without
who would have speech with you he came here in a boat and when he wa
challeng answer with all the sign ay and even spoke the secret
word known to few those word that open the sanctuari door the
priest question him of hi busi he answer that he could tell
it onli to her who bore the jewel sistrum to her who veil her
head with cloud like a mountaintop to that prophetess who in all
shrine is known as childofwisdom but who among men wa name
ayesha daughter of yarab
doubt me of thi man and scent treacheri i caus that
instruct priestess to repeat on by on the mystic word that he
had spoken at last she utter a certain syllabl of which even she
did not know the mean but i knew it and knew also who had it
custodi
fill with a great hope i rose and wrap myself in a dark garment
lead me to thi man i said but first make sure that three priest
stand round him with drawn sword
she went and present return again sai that the man await me
in the forecourt of the littl templ guard as i had bidden to
thi court i follow her it wa but a small place like to a larg
room i enter it from the sanctuari to the west through the eastern
door pour the first rai of the rise sun that struck upon a man
who stood wait in the centr of the court guard by three priest
with lift sword
i could not see hi face though perhap even beneath my cowl he could
see mine upon which those rai also struck at least i saw him start
then fall to hi knee rais hi hand in salut with a quick and
curiou motion it wa enough i knew him at onc thi man wa philo
and no other with a word i bade the arm priest leav us and the
priestess who had accompani me bide in the shadow then i went
forward sai
rise philo for whom i have look so long that i began to think you
were no more to be found beneath the sun whenc come you philo and
for what purpos
o prophetess o ador o ladi divin he answer in a voic of
joi i your slave in the flesh and your fellow servant in the
goddess greet you whom never i hope to see again after all that ha

now tell your tale friend philo i said whenc come you most
welcom philo and by what magic do you find me here
i come from far to the south prophetess out of an ancient land of
which you shall learn afterward for three moon have i struggl over
difficult sea driven by contrari wind to reach the mouth of nile
and to find you if still you live
and who sent you friend philo
a certain master who is known to both of us he sent me
is he perchanc name noot i ask in a low voic and if so did
you sail hither over mortal sea or over those through which ra
travel in the underworld
thi i said wonder for it came into my mind that he who knelt
befor me might perchanc be not a man but a shadow sent to summon me
to the hall of osiri
mortal sea i sail those of the underworld still await my prow o
wisdom daughter here is the proof of it and draw a roll from
hi bosom with it he touch hi brow in token of rever then
gave it to me
i broke the seal i open that roll and by the light of the rise

second time you have escap from fire leav behind you the
ash of your foe come to me now and at onc philo the belov

danger the sistrum shall be your shield i write no more
obei mouth of isi bring with you those that ar left to the
servic of the goddess read the seal of noot highpriest and
prophet and tarri not
i read and hid awai the roll then i ask
upon what wing do we fly to noot who is so far from us friend
philo
upon those of a ship that is known to you prophetess the ship name
hapi upon which alreadi you have pass mani peril she li
yonder fulli man in the outer fring of thi sea of reed
how did you find those reed and how did you know that i wa hidden
among them i ask curious
noot mark them on a chart he gave me and told me that in them
where as the stori run isi discov the heart of osiri there i
should find the child of isi prophetess inquir no more
i heard and return thank in my heart truli what i whisper to the
whisper reed had been born to the ear of heaven
the trirem hapi with her mast struck lai hidden in shallow water
midst bed of tall bulrush and papyru plant into which philo had
work her by the moonlight all that dai we labour lade her with
the treasur of the templ of isi and those of the secret shrine
which were mani for dure these time of troubl much gold and
priceless furnish of preciou metal had been hidden here among the
reed also with them were some of the most ancient and hallow
statu of the goddess fashion in gold and ivori and alabast
stone
all of these togeth with my own great wealth of jewel and other
gear were born in boat to the hapi and store within her hold
where thei lai hid beneath much merchandis that philo had purchas
at the port of nile hither he had come disguis as a merchant from
the south have hi ship laden with the produc of punt such as
ivori and rare wood these he sold at the port where he gather
tide of all that pass in egypt and have purchas other good
in place of them pass unsuspect up the nile to the secret isl of
reed where noot had bidden him to make inquiri for me at the time of
full moon in thi veri month it wa not difficult for him to find
thi isl as it seem that be an initi of isi onc in bygon
dai he had visit it on the busi of the goddess
while we were at thi work we saw boat full of persian soldier pass
down nile as though thei search for someon and toward the even
saw them return up nile again head for memphi i knew for whom
thei sought and note that thei did so veri idli sinc all believ
that i and my compani had perish with the persian in the burn
templ
at nightfal i gather the priest and priestess in all thei were
thirti and three in number and spoke to them sai
here in egypt we who ar the servant of the goddess can stai no
more the god of khem ar fallen their shrine ar desol and
death by sword and fire or by the tortur hook is the lot of
those that worship them noot the highpriest the master the
prophet summon us from afar bid us bear the worship of the
goddess to new land that lie i know not where philo our brother is
hi messeng and here is the messag written in thi roll read it if
you will i the oracl and prophetess obei the summon thi veri
night i sail set my cours for sea unknown and trust to the
goddess to be my guid mayhap into the gate of death noot the high
priest bid you to accompani me yet i give you choic bide on here
if you will and live out your live disguis as scribe or peasant
for in the templ you can no longer find a home mayhap thu you
shall escap the vengeanc of the persian or come with me if you
will know that i promis you noth let each speak as the spirit
direct the heart within
thei consult togeth then on by on thei said that it wa their
mind to be of my compani sinc thei held it better to die with me and
pass pure to the arm of the goddess rather than to live on defil
or perchanc to perish miser beneath the stripe of the
execution have first been forc to do sacrific to the persian
god of fire so man by man and woman by woman thei swore the oath that
might be broken by those who would escap the jaw of the devour
and in token kiss the holi sistrum that i held to the lip of
each then for the last time we celebr the rite of isi in a
templ of isi on the nile and with weep and with woe sang the
psalm of farewel such as is chant over the dead of our fellowship
thi done we went to the boat and were row on board the hapi
when the moon wa bright the marin fierc foreign men most of
them such as i had never seen befor who wore great ear of gold
and had ring thrust through their nose pole the vessel out from
among the reed into the deep water of the nile here thei hoist
the mast and set the sail which present fill befor the strong
wind blow from the upper land and bore us forward swiftli
pass out of the nile by a littleus mouth as we could do now
that the river wa in flood we enter the canal that join the sea
which canal the old pharaoh dug and the persian had caus to be
clear of drift sand by it though not easili for in place it
wa both narrow and shallow at length we came safe into the red sea
and bade farewel to egypt none hinder us on thi journei and
have cross the lake onli onc did we stai at a littl unravag
town at the far mouth of the canal to bui bread fresh fish and meat
wherewith to stock our ship
thi town we found to be full of rumour for the new of the death of
ochu had reach it and mani tale were told of the manner of hi
end that which these coastdwel favour wa that set the god had
appear in person at a feast and seiz ochu had set him upon a
wing api that veri api bull which he had sacrif and eaten
and born him awai to hell at thi fabl i smile though inde in
it there wa a seed of truth sinc without doubt if there be a hell
the bloodsoak ochu wa it inhabit that dai
now of all that journei i who grow weari of write will omit the
stori most marvel it prosper so much so that i think unseen
by us spirit from the underworld must have stood upon our prow
from dai to dai a strong and steadi wind blow from the north drove
us forward swiftli no storm smote us nor did we strike upon ani rock
and when we made land for water either it wa uninhabit or the
folk who dwelt there strang barbar folk were friendli
so the time went by creep from moon to moon and ever we sail on
southward nor wa the time unhappi sinc there i sat in that same
cabin which had been mine when pharaoh gave me as a bribe to tene and
that therefor wa familiar to me have someth of the aspect of a
home inde with a certain tast of acid pleasur from time to time
i recal all that had happen to me upon thi ship and in that veri
cabin for instanc where i had wrung the write from the passion
madden tene where he had stood and knelt where hi shadow had
struck upon the cedar wall there too in the wood wa an arrow
hole which arrow should have drunk my life
then in the waist of the ship wa the place where the boarder from
the holi fire had won aboard whenc kallikr the grecian
captain turn heiroph had beat them back so gallantli aft also
wa the shelter where i had visit him and dress hi wound that
were almost to the death here i place upon hi finger the charm
scarab ring of khaemua the magician whereon were cut symbol with a
secret mean though thei seem to read onli as son of ra that
thi ring might rais him from the dark of death as osiri rose
and as ra rise from the underworld
here too it wa that i heard him mistak me for anoth woman and to
that woman give hi thank thu open my ey to all the folli of
my heart year ago these thing had chanc to me and now when thei
were dead thing i sai that i could dream of them with that soft
grief which is like to the tender of ev after the promis of the
morn and the burn noondai heat have becom but memori buri
beneath the dust of time yet it is true that now and again those
memori renew their life especi within the shrine of sleep
oh it wa all so long ago had not philo beard that i rememb
brown and rich sinc then grown grai and were not hi curl lock
thin upon hi templ and i who then wa young had i not grown to
middleag though still i remain more love than ani other woman
in the world and wa not my soul burden with much learn and had
not the sorrow i had pass pierc it with a thousand spear now
too doubtless kallikr wa dead and all the dream to which he
alon among men had given birth within me had gone wherev dream mai
go perchanc to be lost in the vast unknown or perchanc after the
chang call death there to be found again
yet i i wander forward on my path fatedriven as of old to what
end i knew not and did not greatli care to know for now it seem my
part wa plai the world and it stir were left behind me and
the last shred of my web must be spun of poor stuff in petti unknown
place where i should patter prayer beneath an alien sky till it
pleas death to enfold me in it wing and bear me to the depth of
it enorm habit
well so let it be sinc as i have said i wa weari of the world
it toil it bloodi issu and it perpetu strive to grasp
that which man or woman mai not holdexcept in dream
with philo i talk much but alwai of the past of those thing
which we had experienc togeth or of other event of hi earlier
adventur life or of my own a most pleasant companion wa thi
philo of a shrewd wit and some learn also a brave citizen of the
world who had seen much and yet on who rever the god whatev
the god might be and had thought of that which li beyond the
world whatev thi mai be but of the present or of what had
happen to him sinc he sail awai with noot my master when ochu
invad egypt and least of all of the futur and whither we went or
why i did not talk at all
for when these matter came to my lip as thei did even befor we
were clear of nile philo made a certain sign to me which be
interpret meant that he wa under an oath a veri solemn oath not
to speak of ani of them which oath i respect as inde i wa bound
to do therefor i ask no more and sail on careless as a child
that reck not of what is to come and from whom death is still veri
far awai
chapter xviii
the tale of philo
onc more it wa a night of full moon as we had done for mani dai we
were sail befor that steadi wind along the coast of libya have
thi upon our right hand and upon our left at a distanc a line of
rocki reef upon which breaker fell continu
it wa a veri splendid moon that turn the sea to silver and lit up
the palmgrown shore almost as brightli as doe the sun i sat upon
the deck near to my cabin and by me stood philo watch that shore
intent
for what do you seek philo ar you in fear of sunken rock
nai child of isi yet it is true that i seek a certain rock which
by my reckon should now be in sight ah
then suddenli he ran forward and shout an order men leapt up and
sprang to the rope while the rower began to get out the sweep as
thei did thi the hapi came round so that her bow point to the
shore and the great sail sank to the deck then the long oar bit into
the water and drove us shoreward
philo return
look ladi he said now that the moon ha risen higher you can see
well and he point to a headland in front of us
follow hi outstretch hand with my ey i perceiv a great rock
mani cubit in height and carven on the crest of it a head far larger
than that of the huge sphinx in egypt or perchanc it wa not carv
perchanc natur had fashion it thu at least there it stood and
will stand a terribl and hideou thing have the like of an
ethiopian head gaze etern across the sea
what is it i ask
ladi it is the guardian of the gate of the land whither we go
legend tell that it is shape to the like of the first king of
that land who live thousand upon thousand of year befor the
pyramid were built also that hi bone lie in it or at least that
it is haunt by hi spirit for thi reason none dare to touch and
much less to climb yonder monstrou rock
then he left me to see to the matter of the ship becaus as he said
in go the entranc to the place wa strait and danger but i
sat on alon upon the deck watch thi strang new sight
within an hour row carefulli we enter the mouth of a river
have the rock shape like to a negro head upon our right then it
wa that i saw someth which put me in mind of philo tale about an
ancient king for there unless i dream upon the veri point of the
skull of the effigi of a sudden i perceiv a tall form clad in
armour which shone silveri bright in the moon rai it lean upon a
great spear and when we were opposit to it straighten itself and
bent forward as though to stare at our ship beneath next thrice it
lift the spear in salut thrice it bow as i thought in
obeis to me and have done so threw it arm wide and wa gone
afterward i ask philo if he also had seen thi thing
nai he answer in a doubt voic as though the matter were on
of which he did not wish to talk ad
it is not the custom of marin to studi that head in the moonlight
becaus the stori goe that if thei do and chanc to see some such
ghost as that you tell of it cast a spear toward them who then ar
doom to die within the year yet at you child of isi he cast no
spear onli bow and gave the salut of king or so you tell me
therefor doubtless neither you nor ani of us your companion ar
mark for death
i smile and said that i whose wraith wa in touch with heaven fear
not the wrath of ani ancient king nor did we speak more of thi
matter yet in the after ag it came into my mind that there wa
truth in thi stori and that thi longdead king appear thu to give
greet to her who wa destin to rule hi land through mani
gener also that perchanc he wa not dead at all but have
drunk of a certain cup of life of which i wa to learn live
etern there upon the rock
i laid me down and slept and when i woke in the bright morn it wa
to find that we had pass from that river into a canal dug by man
which though deep wa too narrow for the sweep to work therefor
the hapi must be push along with pole and tow by rope drag
at by the marin from a path that ran upon the bank
for three dai we travel thu make but slow progress sinc the
toil of drag so larg a ship wa great and at night we ti up to
the bank as boat do upon the nile all thi while we saw no
habit though certain ruin we did see inde that countri wa
veri desol and full of great swamp that were tenant by wild
beast the haunt of owl and bittern where lion roar and
serpent crept great serpent such as i had never seen
at length at noon on the fourth dai we came to a lake where the canal
end which lake onc had been a harbour for we saw stone quai
where still were ti some boat that seem to be littl us here
philo said that we must disembark and travel on by land so we left
the hapi sadli enough for my part becaus those were happi quiet
dai that i had spent on board of her verit oas in the storm
swept desert of my life
scarc had we set foot upon the land when appear i knew not
whenc a compani of men handsom hooknos sombr men such as i
had seen among the crew upon the hapi these men though so fierc
in appear were not barbarian for thei wore linen garment that
gave to them the aspect of priest moreov their leader could
speak arab in it most ancient form which have studi it as it
chanc i knew with thi armi who bore bow and spear came a
multitud of folk of a baser sort that carri litter or burden
also a guard of great fellow that philo told me were my especi
escort now my patienc fail so that i turn upon philo sai
hitherto friend i have trust myself to you becaus it seem
decre that i should do so now tell me i prai you what mean thi
journei over countless leagu of sea into a land untrod and whither
go i in the fellowship of these barbarian becaus you brought me a
certain write in an accept hour i gave myself into your
keep nor did i even ask ani revel from the goddess or seek to
solv the mysteri by spell yet now i ask and as the prophetess of
isi demand the truth of you her humbler servant
ladi divin answer philo bow himself befor me what i have
withheld is by command the command of a veri great on of none less
than noot the ag and holi you go to an old land that is yet new to
find noot your master and mine
in the flesh or in the spirit i ask
in the flesh prophetess if still he live as these men sai and
see i accompani you i whom in the past you have found faith if i
fail you let my life pai forfeit and for the rest ask it of the
holi noot
it is enough i said lead on
we enter the litter we lade the bearer with the treasur of
isi and with my own peculiar wealth and have place the ship
hapi under guard march into the unknown like to some great
caravan of merchant for dai we march follow a broad road that
wa broken down in place over plain and through vast swamp and at
night sleep in cave or cover by tent which we brought with us
thi wa a strang journei that i made surround by that host of
hooknos silent ghostlik men who as i note love the night
better than thei did the dai almost might i have thought that thei
had been sent from hade to conduct us to those gate from which for
mortal there is no return my fellowship of the priest and
priestess grew afraid and cluster round me at night prai to be
led back to familiar land and face
i answer them that what i dare thei must dare also and that the
goddess wa as near to us here as she had been in egypt nor could
death be closer to us than it wa in egypt yea i bade them have
faith sinc without faith we could not be at peac on hour who
lack it must be overwhelm with terror even with the wall of
citadel
thei hearken bow their head and sai that whatev els thei
might doubt thei trust themselv to me
so we went on pass through a countri where more of these half
savag men that i learn were call amahagg dwelt in villag
surround by their cattl or by coloni in cave at last there
aros befor us a mighti mountain whose tower cliff had the
appear of a wall so vast that the ey could not compass it by a
gorg we penetr that mountain and found within it an enorm
fertil plain and on the plain a citi larger than memphi or than
thebe but a citi half in ruin
pass over a great bridg span a wide moat onc fill with
water that now here and there wa dry we enter the wall of that
citi and by a street broader than ani i had ever seen border by
mani nobl broken hous though some of these seem still to be
inhabit came to a gloriou templ like to those of egypt onli
greater and with taller column across it grassgrown court that
were set on within anoth we were carri to some inner sanctuari
here we descend from the litter and were led to sculptur chamber
that seem to have been made readi to receiv us where we cleans
ourselv of the dust of travel and at then came philo who
conduct me to a littl lamplit hall for now the night had fallen
where wa a chair of state such as highpriest us in which at hi
bid i sat myself
i think that be weari with travel i must have slept in that chair
sinc i dream or seem to dream that i receiv worship such as is
given to a queen or even to a goddess herald hail me voic sang
to me even spirit appear in troop to talk to me the spirit of
those who thousand of year befor had depart from the earth thei
told me strang stori of the past and of the futur tale of a
fallen peopl of a worship and a glori that had gone by and been
swallow in the gulf of time then gather in a multitud thei
seem to hail me cry
welcom appoint queen build thou up that which ha fallen
discov thou that which is lost thine is the strength thine the
opportun yet bewar of the temptat bewar of the flesh lest
the flesh should overcom the spirit and by it fall add ruin unto
ruin the ruin of the soul to the ruin of the bodi
i awok from my vision and saw philo stand befor me
hearken philo i said of these mysteri i can bear no more the
time ha come when you must speak or face my wrath why have i been
brought hither to thi strang and distant land where it seem that i
must dwell in a place of ruin
becaus the holi noot so command o child of wisdom he answer
wa it not set down in the write i gave you at the isl of reed
upon the nile
where then is the holi noot i ask here i see him not is he
dead
i do not think that he is dead ladi yet to the world he is dead he
ha becom a hermit on who dwell in a cave in a peril place not
veri far from thi citi tomorrow i will bring you to him if that be
your will so onli can you see him who now for year ha never left
that cave or so i think save to fetch the food which is prepar for
him
a strang tale philo though that noot should becom a hermit doe
not amaz me sinc such wa ever hi desir now tell me how he came
hither and you with him
ladi you will rememb that in the bygon year when nectaneb he
who wa pharaoh fled up nile the holi noot embark upon my ship
the hapi to sail to the northern citi that there he might treat
with the persian for the ransom of those templ of egypt that
remain unravish
i rememb philo what chanc to you upon that journei
thi ladi that we were veri nearli slain everi on of us for whom
the persian had set a trap think to snare noot and hi compani
and tortur him till he reveal where the treasur of the templ of
isi were hid awai nevertheless becaus i am a good sailor and
becaus that warrior priest kallikr wa brave we escap into
the canal which is call the road of rames and so at last out to
sea for to return up nile wa imposs then noot command that i
should sail on southerli upon a cours he seem to know well enough
or perchanc the goddess taught it to him i cannot sai at least i
obei so that in the end we reach that harbour which is guard by
a rock carv to the like of an ethiopian head and thenc
travel to thi place still guid by the wisdom of noot who knew
the road
and kallikr what becam of kallikrateswho it seem wa with
you i ask in an indiffer voic though my heart burn to hear
hi answer
ladi so far as it is known to me thi is the stori of kallikr
and the princess amenarta
the princess amenarta by all the god what is your mean philo
she went up nile with nectaneb her father he who wa pharaoh
nai ladi she went down nile with kallikr or perhap with noot
or perhap with herself alon i do not know with whom she hid sinc i
never saw her nor learn that she wa aboard my ship until we were
two dai journei out to sea and the coast of egypt were far behind
us
is it so i ask coldli though i wa fill with bitter anger
and what did the holi noot when he found that thi woman wa aboard
hi vessel
ladi he did noth except look on her somewhat doubtfulli
and what did the priest kallikr did he strive to be rid of her
nai ladi and inde that would have been imposs unless he had
thrown her overboard he did noth except talk with herthat is so
far as i saw
well then philo where is she now and where is kallikr i do
not see him in thi place
ladi i cannot tell you but i think it probabl that thei ar dead
and in the fellowship of osiri when we had been some week at sea we
were driven by storm to an island off the coast under the lee of which
we took shelter a veri fertil and beauti island peopl by a
kindli folk after we had sail again from that island it wa
discov that the priest kallikr and the royal princess
amenarta were miss from the ship nor becaus of the strong wind
that blew us forward wa it possibl for us to return to seek for
them i made inquiri of the matter and the sailor told me that thei
had been fish togeth and that a shark which took their bait
pull them both into the sea in which case doubtless thei were
drown
and did you believ that stori philo
nai ladi i understood at onc that it wa on which the sailor had
been bribe to tell myself i think that thei went to the island in
on of the boat of the peopl who dwell there perhap becaus thei
could no longer bear the cold ey of noot fix upon them or perhap
to gather fruit for which those who have been long upon water often
conceiv a great desir but he ad simpli i do not know why
thei should have done thi see that the islanddwel brought us
plenti of fruit in their boat
doubtless thei prefer to pluck them fresh with their own hand
philo
perhap ladi or perhap thei wish to stai awhil upon that
island at least i note that the princess took her garment and her
jewel with her which she could scarc have done if the shark had
drag her into the sea
ar you so sure philo that she did not leav some of those jewel
behindin your keep philo it is veri strang to me that the
princess amenarta could have come aboard your ship and have left your
ship and you know noth
now philo look up innoc and said
sure it is law for a captain to receiv fare monei from hi
passeng and that i admit i did but i do not understand why the
child of wisdom is so wrath becaus a greek and a great ladi were by
chanc left togeth upon an island where for aught i know on or
other of them mai have had friend
am i not the guardian of the honour of the goddess i answer and
do you not know that under our law kallikr wa sworn to her
alon
if so prophetess doubtless that captain or that priest rememb
hi oath and deal with thi princess as though she were hi sister or
hi mother at the least the goddess can guard her own honour so why
should you fret your soul concern it prophetess lastli it is
probabl that by now both of them ar dead and have made all thing
clear to isi in the heavenli hall
thu he prattl on ad lie to lie as onli a greek can do i
listen until i could bear no more then i said but on word it wa
begon
he went humbl yet as i thought smile
oh now i saw it all noot had made a plot to remov kallikr far
from me so that i might never look upon him again philo knew of thi
plot and through him amenarta knew it also unknown to noot she
bribe philo to hide her upon hi ship till thei were far from land
though whether the plan wa known to kallikr i could not sai nor
did it greatli matter then the rest follow amenarta appear upon
the ship and cast her net about kallikr who had sworn to have done
with her and the end can be guess noot wa wrath with them so
wrath that when the chanc came thei fled awai purpos to stai upon
that island until thei could find a ship to take them back to egypt or
elsewher thu i wa sure ran the stori and as it prove
afterward i wa right
well thei were gone and as i hope dead sinc onli death could
cover up such a sin and for my part i wa glad that i had done with
kallikr and hi lightoflov and yet there seat on the couch
of state i weptbecaus of the outrag done to isi whom i serv
or wa it for myself that i wept i cannot sai i onli know that my
tear were bitter also i wa veri lone in thi strang and desol
place becaus noot had command it send for me from afar and
what he command that i must obei where then wa noot who philo
swore still live why had he not appear to greet me i cover my

her citizen worship isi queen of heaven onli thei name her
truth whom in egypt you know as maat then apostasi aros and mani
of thi great peopl abandon the pure and gentl worship of isi
wrap in the veil of truth under the name of rezu a fierc sun
daemon set up anoth god to whom thei made human sacrific as the
sidonian did to moloch yea thei sacrif men women and children
by thousand and even learn to eat their flesh first as a sacr
rite and afterward to satisfi their appetit heaven saw and grew
wrath heaven smote the peopl with a mighti pestil so that thei
perish and perish till few were left thu kor fell by the sword
of god as for like caus fell sidon
of all thi afterward i answer impati tell me first how
came you here long year ago you sail down nile to treat with the
persian for the ransom of the templ of egypt a mission in which it
seem you fail my father
ay ayesha i fail it wa but a trap sinc those falseheart
fireworshipp thought to take me captiv and hold my life in gage
against all the treasur of isi by the cun and seamanship of
philo and the courag of a priest name kallikr whom you mai
still rememb after all these year here he glanc at me sharpli
i escap when a gang of them disguis as envoi strove to snare me

ar thi pair dead or do thei still live my father
i cannot sai that also is hidden from me better for them if thei
ar dead sinc soon or late for such sacrileg vengeanc will fall
upon the head of on if not of both of them peac be to them mai
thei be forgiven at least as i think thei love each other much and
sinc love is veri strong all who have ever love where thei ought
not should have piti on them and again hi question ey plai

chapter xix
the hermitag of noot
tell me of what ha pass in egypt sinc ochu conquer and
nectaneb fled awai doe ochu still live daughter ask noot
after a paus dure which both of us had sat stare at the ground
nai father ochu is dead and by my hand or through it and i told
him all that stori of the burn of the templ of isi at my command
and of the persian who defil it
a great deed such as you alon could have plan he mutter but
terribl terribl
then your soul must bear it burden prophet sinc it wa your voic
that we heard in the sanctuari when in our extrem we prai for
guidanc and it told us to go forward there ar those with me who
can bear wit that thei heard your veri voic as i do
mayhap daughter it is true that on a certain dai not so mani moon
ago i seem to hear you call to heaven in great troubl and
danger also that by direct which came i know not whenc i
answer in my spirit that you must fulfil and fear not what you
were to fulfil i did not know though it came to my mind that the
busi had someth to do with the burn of a templ
as it had inde well i fulfil as ochu artaxerx with some
hundr of hi persian ravag can testifi befor all the god until
the end of time for those dog at least have ceas to pollut the
earth and todai ar enrich hell there let them lie with tene and
nectaneb also if in truth he ha join them and mani anoth
fals priest and king afterward we will talk of them and all their
deed of shame but first tell me why i am here for what end did you
summon me from egypt wa it to save me from death
nai ayesha from more than that why should i wish to hold you back
from the great boon of death in which so soon i must have join you
i summon you becaus i wa command so to do that now when isi
ha pass from egypt you should caus her worship to rearis at kor
which wa her ancient home it is will that here you should abid
and onc more build up thi peopl and make it great by the help of
the queen of heaven who then will lead it on to triumph and to glori
that is a mighti task prophet still perchanc with your aid it mai
be done if the god give me life and wisdom
he shook hi head and answer
look not to my aid for at length my dai is finish ha not philo
told you that i mix no more with matter of the world i who for year
past have dwelt a hermit in a terribl place shelter onli by a cave
and lost in the contempl of holi thing
no father he ha told me littl or nothingbi your will or so he
said i repli amaz
yet it is so moreov present i must return to that prison whenc
i came there to await the chang call death i have plai my part
but your work still remain to do philo will aid you in it
why do you live in that place father leav me without the
guidanc of your wisdom
becaus there i guard a great secret that wa reveal to me long
ago it matter not how the greatest secret in the whole worldthat
of how men mai escap death and live on etern upon the earth
now i stare at him think that ag and abstin had made him
mad then to test the matter i ask
if it be so great a secret why do you tell it to me master
becaus i must becaus i know well that if i do not you would
discov it for yourself and be unwarn would fall into the
trap and still live beneath the sun dare to cloth yourself with
thi garment of immort it wa for thi reason that until twice
the command had come to me i would not summon you to kor
now a new thought thrill my soul if thi strang tale were true if
inde here on earth there could be found such a door lead to the
divin why should i not pass it and becom as ar the god onli i
did not believ that it wa true
sure you have dream in your loneli my father i said but
know that if you did not dream if it were true i ayesha should be
mind to wear that robe of life etern why not o prophet
becaus ayesha the man or woman who dare to eat of thi fruit
forbidden to their race here on earth where death is decre for all
would be a man or woman who dare to enter into hell
i think otherwis prophet noot i think that thi man or woman would
enter into glori and becom the ruler of the world i answer and
as i spoke the word my ey flash and my breast heav
not so ayesha sinc from that fatal peak of pride heaven will beat
back all human feet oh hearken to me and purg your soul of the
mad of thi desir by which i see alreadi it is possess it wa
laid upon me to reveal thi secret to you which i think wa given me
for that veri purpos so that you might show your great by
reject it the deadliest bribe that the god of ill ever offer to
mortal woman
or perchanc by accept it master
nai nai bethink you is the world a fit place for the undi
moreov thi secret that i guard is but the world spirit not that
of immort the hidden forc from which our earth draw it
strength but which will perish with the earth as it must do upon a
dai still hidden in the deep of time the drinker of that cup
therefor would becom not etern but longliv onli destin to
perish at last with thi pass star for him death would not be
destroi it would onli be delai wait ever to snare him in the
end meanwhil he must endur desol and alon watch the
gener pass on by on to their appoint rest while fill
perchanc with fear appetit which he must know etern and yet
remain unsatisfi he stand but as a frozen rock upon the plain
wear a human shape yet alien to mortal though still torn by
it ambit it love it hate it hope it fear and wait
terrifi for that predestin moment when thi globe shall crumbl
and death shall devour it and him
i am old i am feebl my hour is well nigh done i pass to my repos
in heaven ayesha i have no strength to stai your feet if you elect
to drink thi cup my weak hand cannot dash it from your lip yet as
on who ha taught and love you as on to whom the god have given
great wisdom i prai you to thrust asid thi great temptat as our
faith teach truli alreadi your spirit is immort and ha it home
prepar abov desir not therefor to perpetu your flesh sinc
if you do ayesha i tell you that you will becom but as a paint
mummi in a tomb simul life yet dead and cold within swear to
me daughter that you will lock thi knowledg in your heart and
thrust the poison from your lip
you speak wise i answer ay as on inspir by the truth
and though i take no oath it is my purpos to do your will yet
father what is thi secret have told me so much tell all lest i
should go to discov it for myself
daughter near to thi ancient citi amid the mountain cliff deep
in the bowel of the rock burn a travel fire which is the veri
soul of the world the flame heart that give it life yet thi fire
is no fire but rather the essenc of exist and he who bath in
it will be fill with that essenc and endur while it endur
perchanc such a on might be destroi by that fire i answer
doubtfulli
daughter i would that i could leav you think thu for then a
great fear would pass from me but we who ar the chief servant of
isi dare not hide the truth from on anoth sinc to do so is to
break our oath moreov in thi matter i do not speak with my own
voic but with that of a strength which is greater than i to whom
now i stand so near that almost it and i ar on therefor to your
ey i must withdraw all veil show you what is as it is and not
as i would have it be yonder fire will not destroi the mortal who
find the courag to stand in it rage path it will give him life
and with it such strength such beauti and such wisdom as have never
been the lot of man born of woman also it will give him such
passion such despair such unend woe as hitherto no mortal
heart ha known
there is the truth ask me not how it come into my keep and what
that voic mai be which is speak it through my lip a minut gone
thi truth wa mine alon or perchanc mine and on other now it
is your also and be your i prai to that divin from which we
come and whither we return again that it mai give you strength and
the true wisdom know all to reject all and turn asid from
thi glitter guerdon of endur life patient to walk your human
path to the end appoint to our human feet
will you show me thi fire prophet
ay if you will for so i am command he answer faintli yet
why look upon that which must excit desir
then weari overcam him and he sank down swoon so that had i
not caught him he would have fallen
noot abod three dai at kor and talk with me of mani thing but at
that time of the wonder secret of life he spoke no more as though
by consent both of us let that matter lie awhil for the rest there
wa much to sai i told him everyth that had pass in egypt and
the outer world sinc long year befor he had left me to sail down
nile never to return i told him how i had obei hi last command
to the letter and surround though i wa by foe had preserv the
worship of isi in her templ from season to season celebr her
festiv in their appoint cours though i never dare to leav it
wall
so ayesha he said when i had done while i have been a hermit
here at kor you have been a hermit at memphi well each of us ha
serv the goddess as best might be so mai she reward us both
accord to our desert which doubtless ar but small and now my
task is finish but your li befor you see that you still
have strength even if your youth ha gone
ye i answer somewhat bitterli midag ha overtaken me my
youth ha pass in the servic of heaven and what ha heaven given
to me after all my war and strive just thisthat in a savag
desol land among ruin and barbarian i must begin anew i must
restor a faith decai collect those barbarian into armi and
order them enact law and caus them to be obei fight battl
till land build ship and carri on commerc collect revenu and
spend them wise labour without ceas dai by dai find but littl
rest at night becaus of the troubl that await the morrow i must be
at onc a highpriestess an oracl a gener a lawgiv a judg
an architect a landtil and a queen beneath an alien sky without
counsel without friend without love without children to tend me in
my ag or to pile the earth upon my bone such is the lot that the
goddess ha given to her priestess ayesha in payment of all her
strive
thu i spoke bitterli enough but noot answer with a gentl smile
at least daughter it might have been more evil you have a plan
and a thought mind and here you can shape all thing afresh to your
desir you love power and here you will be absolut a veri queen
you who cannot brook denial here there will be none to sai you nai
you hate rival who would rule alon here thei will be lack you
desir to remain celib who ar wed to the spirit here no more
king or other will come to troubl you plot to win your beauti
it ha ever been your wish to commun with natur and that divin from
which it spring here in thi desert place is natur veri home
and in solitud the divin draw near to empti soul
truli you should be thank therefor whose prayer have been
fulfil who have attain to all you sought whose ambit ar
satisfi and who in the holi calm and the health weari that
follow upon longcontinu labour at last when your task is done
will sink gentli to the grave to seek their reward elsewher soon
veri soon you will be as i am and when that dai come there will be
an empti hermitag yonder where in dark and in contempl you
can patient await the end and those new endeavour which after it
mai be appoint to you elsewher for be sure of thi ayeshaal
exist is a ladder up which painfulli and with mani slip we must
climb step by step
and when we reach the top what then master
i do not know daughter but i do know that if we fall to the bottom
all those step must be climb again onli thi time the rung of the
ladder will be wreath with thorn
it seem that yonder hermitag of your is no home of joi my
father
nai daughter it is a home of grief and repent the joi li
beyond such ar the philosophi of life and the teach of all
religion be sorrow and afterward you will rejoic rejoic and
afterward you will be sorrow
a sad philosophi prophet and such lesson as slave learn beneath
the whip
ay ayesha but on that must be endur as if thei could speak
tene and ochu and nectaneb would tell you todai
so he drone on who grew weak and senil have becom but the dry
shell of a man whenc the sap had wither like to a steril nut
inde from which if it were sown no shoot would spring at length
weari of hi melancholi talk i fell to the thought of that fire of
life rage in it etern vigour beneath hi hermitag which as he
swore would give unend beauti youth glori and dominion to him
who could find faith and courag to dare it terror
on the follow dai i accompani noot back to hi hermitag for the
quiet of which he seem to yearn so much so inde that even for my
sake whom he love more than anyth on earth and in whose fellowship
he delight he would not be separ from it for anoth hour
it wa a rough journei that we made born in litter to the foot of
the great precipic which surround the plain of kor like to a
measureless wall chisel by titan at the shape of the world we
climb up a cleft in that wall and enter a hidden fold of rock
invis from below follow thi fold we came to the mouth of a
cave here i note that food wa set in plenti by the dweller in thi
land who rever noot as a prophet and thu suppli him with hi
susten here also were torch which were lit by those who
accompani us to give us light upon our journei through the cave that
wa long and rough at length we came to it end to find befor us a
terribl chasm thousand of feet abov us wa a line of blue sky and
beneath lai a gulf of dark out into thi chasm down which wind
rave and howl ran a giant spur of rock of which the end wa lost
in dark i look at it doubtfulli and said
where then is your habit noot and by what road is it reach
it li yonder in the dark daughter he answer smile and
thi is the road that those who would visit me must travel and he
point to the spur of rock that trembl in the roar gale ad
to my feet it is familiar moreov i know that on it as elsewher i
am protect from harm but if you fear to walk such a path turn back
while there is still time perhap it would be better that you should
turn back
now i look at the trembl rock and then i look at noot my
master
what thought i to myself shall i ayesha who dread neither man
nor devil be afraid to follow where thi frail old priest can lead
never will i blench from peril though in it li my death
so i stare him in the face and answer
to the task father and swiftli for here the wind blow chill i go
first philo follow me close
now philo who wa my companion upon thi adventur glanc at me
with question ey but be a brave man and on who as a sailor
wa accustom to peril height said noth
for a moment noot paus look upward perchanc to prai or
perchanc for other reason then have ask philo how long it wa
to the time of sunset and been answer that it lack between the
half and the fourth part of an hour befor ra sank behind the western
cliff he start walk boldli down the spur i follow next and
last came philo
veri terribl wa that journei in the uncertain light which as we
progress into the gulf grew ever fainter till at last we were
wrap about with gloom moreov alwai the spur of rock narrow
and the rave gust of wind which blew about that hideou gorg
buffet us more fierc
still we went on lean our weight against them and as we went a
kind of exalt seiz me as it doe alwai in moment of great
danger so that my heart grew bold and fear no more i would match
myself against these element strength as i had match myself
against those of hostil and desir king and conquer them or
perchanc it wa the breath from the divin fire that burn below
that alreadi had enter into me i cannot sai but thi i rememb
that befor i had reach the point of that fear rock i wa fill
with a wild joi and could laugh at philo crawl after me with
hesit step and breath prayer now to isi and now to the
grecian god that he had worship as a child
at length we came to the end of that long needl which thrust itself
thu into the dark stuff of space and as we did so all light went out
of the sky abov leav us plung in black i seat myself
upon the throb point of rock cling to philo who had done
likewis and cri into the ear of noot kneel at our side
what now show us and be swift lest we should be thrown from thi
place like stone from a sling
hold fast and wait answer noot
we did so grasp the rough of the rock with our hand then
suddenli a marvel happen sinc from somewher i know not whenc
and have never learn a fierc red rai of light cast doubtless by
the set sun struck us through some hole in the oppos cliff
ay it struck like a blaze sword show all thing that could be
seen thei were these ourselv crouch upon that point of rock
infinit space beneath us infinit space abov reach up to a
singl star that shone upon the sky and we three hem in by two
black precipic moreov thei show not four pace from the
point a huge trembl stone that wa join to that fearsom spar by
a littl bridg of wood laid from the on to the other by the hand of
man which bridg rose and fell and rock as the great stone trembl
on it farther side
follow me swiftli befor the light di cri noot as he step
across thi bridg and reach the crest of the trembl stone
stood there like a ghost illumin with fire like also to that figur
which i had seen watch from the brow of the ethiopian head when
we enter the harbour from the sea
i obei and join him and after me came philo
by the last rai of that fleet light we descend a rough stairwai
cut on the farther side of the trembl stone and of a sudden found
ourselv in shelter light sprang up and i saw that it wa held in
the hand of a dwarf a curiou solemn dwarf whenc thi creatur
came and who he wa i do not know but i think that he must have been
a spirit some gnome from the underworld appoint by the power
which rule in that dark place to attend to the want of the holi
noot their master and mine
thi i note at least and so did philo that we could never see thi
creatur face even when he move about us alwai it seem to be
hidden either by shadow or someth that hung in front of it like a
veil yet man or gnome or ghost he wa a good servant sinc in
that hermit cave or rather cave for there were sever of them
join on to the other all thing were made readi thu a fire
burn food wa prepar upon a tabl and in the inner cave bed
were spread each in a littl separ chamber
the outer cave also wa furnish in a fashion and i note that in a
nich stood the small statu of isi which i rememb well sinc
wherev noot my master went in the past year when we journei
togeth that statu went with him and now still it wa hi
companion inde the tale wa that it could speak and gave him
counsel in all hour of doubt and troubl and that from thi
enchant thing he gather hi great wisdom whether or no thi tale
were true i do not know sinc i never heard it utter word nor
would noot tell me when i ask him yet it is true that it wa hi
custom to prai to it also that it wa veri ancient and valu by him
more than all the gold and jewel on the earth now it stood here as
it had done in my father hous at ozal as it had done at phila in
hi chamber at memphi on the ship hapi and elsewher when we
journei togeth throughout the world and it wa strang to me to
behold it familiar face again in thi dread habit
eat said noot then sleep for you ar weari
philo and i did as he command we at we laid ourselv down upon
the bed in the inner cave and slept the last thing that my ey
saw befor slumber close them wa noot my master now becom more of
a spirit than a man kneel in solemn prayer befor the hallow
effigi of isi
i know not for how long we slept but it must have been mani hour
for when we woke it wa to see that dwarf whose face wa alwai
hidden set anoth meal upon the tabl in the outer cave there
too by the lamplight i perceiv noot still prai to the statu of
isi as though he had never risen from hi knee which perchanc he
had not done who no longer wa as ar other men it wa a strang
sight in that dread place and on that affright philo as he told
me and left me not unmov who felt that here we stood upon the edg
of mortal thing
i went to him and see me come he rose from hi knee to greet me
ask me whether i had rest well
neither well nor ill i answer i slept yet my sleep wa full of
dream veri strang dream that bode i know not what thei told me
both of the past and of the futur and the burden of them wa that i
seem to see myself live alon from gener to gener in
cave as you do todai
mai the god defend you from such a fate daughter he answer as
though the thought disturb him
thei have not defend you father oh how can you bear to dwell in
the dark of thi dread place round which the wind howl
etern companion onli by your thought and a dwarf who never
speak how did you find it how came you here and what put into your
mind the thought of choos thi burrow for a hermitag tell me
truli who as yet i think have hidden half the truth even from me
for i am devour with wonder and would understand
hearken ayesha when first we met in arabia i wa alreadi veri old
wa i not i who now long have pass the tale of man allot dai
befor that time for mani year i had been a headpriest and prophet
of isi in egypt also the chief magician of that land yet i wa not
born an egyptian nor did my ey so much as look upon the nile until i
had count over sixti summer
where then were you born father
here in kor i am the last descend of the kingpriest who rule
in kor befor the great apostasi and the fall of the sword of god
to the holi men who were my father had descend their knowledg of
that secret of secret whereof i have spoken to you and ever it wa
their custom when ag took a hold of them to withdraw into thi live
sepulchr and there as guardian of the fire to await the end also
under mani oath each of them pass on to hi descend the
knowledg of the secret
thu daughter it came into my keep for my grandsir told my
father and my father whisper it to me then while my grandsir
still live the goddess for her own end of which now i think i see
the purpos call me from thi desol land awai to egypt there to
serv her as i have done again she call me to arabia that there you
might be given into my keep as you were for certain year a third
time she call me back to kor whither i came with philo here i
found my grandsir dead and hi son my father dead after him
leav the hermitag of the watcher of the fire unten therefor
set philo to command the savag tribe who dwell around the ruin
of haunt kor hither i came as for gener my forbear have
done to fill the offic that thei fill andto die
forget me upon whose head you left a heavi burden my father in
isi i said bitterli
nai ayesha i forgot you not who knew well that at the appoint
time we should meet onc more as meet we have alwai in my prayer i
have watch over you and mani of your troubl and danger have been
made known to me in dream it wa in a dream that i heard you call
for guidanc and sent the answer that wa command ay and befor
that alreadi i had despatch philo to egypt to bring you to me as
also i wa command and now you stand here befor me in my hermitag
and i tell you all these thing becaus last night i learn while i
prai and you were lost in sleep that we shall speak no more
togeth my hour is at hand and sinc i have no child of my bodi to
you my child in the spirit i pass on the great secret as to you
alreadi i have pass on my high offic and my wisdom when the breath
ha left me ayesha then to you will descend the guardianship of the
fire and here doubtless when ag ha overtaken you you also will
end your dai

and listen to the tempest that rage etern without
ay ayesha it is so sinc that is the high duti laid upon your
soul wherebi it shall find wing to fly to heaven know that no
guardian of the fire enter into the fire he watch itno moreand
if it is threaten he seal it for ever from the sight of man
listen i will tell you how and lean forward he whisper certain
word into my ear and show me certain hidden thing
i heard i saw i bow my head then i ask
and if the guardian of the fire enter into the fire what then
watcher of the fire
daughter i know not he answer horrorstruck but then i think
the fire would becom hi guardian a terribl guardian that at the
last would also be the destroy of it fals servant more i cannot
tell becaus though some have breath it essenc none of them ha
dare thi deed
two night ago you told me o noot that thi fire give youth and
beauti and uncount dai to those who bath therein if none ha ever
enter it how know you thi
becaus it is so ayesha moreov i did not sai that none had ever
enter it perchanc there ar be now known to the world as god
or daemon who by accid rather than design have tast of thi
cup perchanc that shape you saw stand on the ethiopian head in
some bygon ag stood for an instant in it path at least i repeat
that it is so believ or disbeliev me as you will but ask me no
more and abov all do not ventur to solv the mysteri in your mortal
flesh
at least prophet let me look upon that which i must guard i said
ay you shall look he answer it is for that reason that i have
brought you here priestess and daughter of wisdom for have look
i do not think that you will desir to bath in that red flame eat
now and make readi
chapter xx
the come of kallikr
awhil later we left the cave noot philo and i each of us bear
a light lamp clad in a dark cloak noot led the wai hi lamp in on
hand and in the other a long staff such as herdsmen us upon the
mountain side strang enough he seem thu arrai with hi thin
transpar face hi ey grown larg and lumin from stare at
the dark and hi long white beard show like snow against the
black textur of the cloak more of a spirit than a man inde or
like charon lead shadow of the dead to that boat in which all
ay even i ayeshamust embark at last never shall i forget hi
aspect as he search for and found the stair that led to the rock
strewn slope which stretch downward for a furlong or more to the
narrow passag at it end through which present we travel into
the infern hall beyond
great were those hall or cavern so great that we lightbear were
but as ant creep through their vast so great that we could
see neither their wall nor roof
we pass through two of them our footfal echo in their fear
silenc and came to a passag
bide here said noot to philo and await us sinc it is not law
for you to look upon that which li beyond if perchanc we should
not return within three hour so nearli as you can measur them which
mai happen sinc we go to where there is danger for mankind win your
wai back to the world and sai that the god have taken noot the
prophet and ayesha the highpriestess to be of their compani
so philo out of whose ey all the grecian joyous had fled sat
himself down upon a rock to wait as i could see unwillingli enough
for he love thi adventur littl and wa troubl for the safeti of
me whom he love much
fear not i whisper to him the hour is still far in which ayesha
must fall a ripe fruit from the tree of life
i prai so child of isi he answer sinc sure we have enter
into hade where i would not be left without so much as a fellow shade
to comfort me yet bewar for i know not whither that old ghost is
lead you and he glanc at the tall shape of noot stride into
the tunnel in which thi cave end the lamp held abov hi head
i follow after him also hold my lamp aloft though present it
becam needless sinc now the dark of that hole grew aliv with
rosi light on like a swift shadow glide noot and i follow him
into the heart of the light into a place too where thunder wa
imprison like wind in the bag of aeolu ay a place fill with
glori and with roar though whenc these came i could not guess
we enter yet anoth cavern not so veri larg in size and carpet
with fine white sand
it wa empti save for on thing on the sand lai a wither shape a
hideou littl shape that onc had been man or woman whose it wa and
how it came there i never learn sinc in the marvel of all that
follow and afterward i forgot to ask it of noot if inde he could
have told me perchanc some seeker of the fire who live a thousand
or ten thousand year befor had perish of terror at the sight of
it or perchanc for hi or her impieti that seeker had been
sacrif by god or men yet even then i thought it dread and
omin that the first sight my ey beheld in thi terribl place
should be thi shrivel longhair lump of death ly there in
etern solitud while in front of and around it plai the fierc
essenc of life etern
thi cavern wa fill with a light like to that of some tempestu
libyan dawn also it wa fill with a mutter thunder sound
such sound as is caus by the iron wheel of a thousand chariot
rush to battl adown a rocki wai the light multipli and wa
stab through as though by mani colour levin flash hither and
thither the thunder gather to an aw roar those unearthli
chariot were roll down upon us
to your knee cri noot in my ear the fire come the god is
pass by
i knelt my hand rest by chanc upon that littl shrivel form
and lo at my touch it crumbl into dust it had been it wa not
the grin twist face wa gone noth remain of it save a lock
or two of curl hairsur it must have been a woman hair then
the marvel happen befor me appear a turn column of gloriou
manycolour bright that roar and bellow like a million
madden bull to my ey it seem to take the shape of a mighti
man and in it glow crest i saw green ey of emerald like to
those of tiger which ey fix themselv upon me arm it had
also bloodr splendid arm that stretch themselv toward me as
though to clasp me to that burn breast it wa terribl and yet it
wa most beauteou never until i saw it had i known beauti no not
even in the dawn or in the sunset or in the sight of the wild shock
of battl
thi mighti god of life seem to call to the life within me like a
king to hi subject like a master to hi slave i long to lose
myself in that embrac of fire half i rose from my knee noot caught
me by the arm
enter not he cri sternli and again i sank down and hid my face
upon the sand
how long i lai there i do not know for exalt seiz me and made
my sens drunk so that i could take no count of time it mai have
been for a minut or an hour i sai i do not know when i look up
again the fire had gone by the god wa hidden in hi secret
sanctuari though still the cavern glow with rosi light
noot drew me from that place without we found philo palelip and
trembl and togeth slowli and with labour we climb our upward
cours back to the hermitag beneath the swai stone here we rest
in silenc until at last noot drew me asid and spoke
ayesha he said you have seen as it wa decre that you must see
in that burn presenc temptat took hold of you so sharp a hold
that had i not been there perchanc you would have yield
forget my warn and my prayer now i beseech you guard the
fire in the dai to come but look on it no more for ever sinc
although in other matter you ar so strong in thi i feel you frail
while i live inde never again shall you behold it with your ey
sinc first i will call upon the goddess to cut your thread of life
and take you to herself
i bow my head but made no answer nor did he ask for ani
what happen then oh i rememb that we at of food that wa made
readi doubtless by the gnomelik dwarf whom i saw no more after thi
noot look from the door of hi hermitag and call to us to come
swiftli sinc the moment of sunset that brought with it the fall
rai wa at hand and the bridg must be cross and the narrowest of
the stone spur travel er it depart hold light lantern in
our hand he led us to the crest of the trembl stone whereon the
timber of the bridg creak and swai here he clasp me in hi
arm bless me and bid me farewel and though he said it not
i wa certain that in hi mind as at the moment i did in mine he
believ that our spirit part for ever upon thi earth ye
believ it so sure that tear cours down hi pale cheek
then suddenli the swordlik rai of fire stab the dark and by
it i and philo cross the bridg and while it endur clamber
swiftli along the spur of which i know not why all fear had left me
as that rai began to fade i turn my head to look my last on noot
there in the heart of it he stood cloth as it were with fire as
our faith tell ar the messeng of isi queen of heaven ye
there he stood with clasp hand and uplift ey like to on lost
in prayer then the rai went out like a blown lamp and the dark
fell and swallow him
we gain the plain in safeti and through the night were born back to
kor the litter swai the slave whose shoulder bent beneath the
pole sang their low weird chant invit to sleep but it messeng
would not touch my eyelid with their rod of slumber i could not
sleep whose soul burn with a fierc wake oh what wa thi
wonder that i had seen the veri fount of life that hidden from
mankind burn in the womb of the world but if it were thi why did
noot speak of it as though it were a fount of death why did he forbid
me to tast it cup perhap becaus not life but death inhabit that
flame as the littl wither thing which had crumbl at my touch
that onc had been man or womanwoman as i thinkhint to the
mind
i knew not but what i did know wa that henceforth i wa plight to
thi god of fire and that in some dai to come i must feel hi burn
marriag kiss upon my brow
when we came to kor at the sunris i beckon philo to me and made to
him the sign of silenc which be initi he knew well so that
neither then nor at ani other time should ani word concern these
mysteri pass hi lip nor inde could it do so as he had not
look upon the greatest of them and onli from afar had listen to
the thunder of the wheel flame
then with a new energi as though inspir by the breath of that fieri
god i got me to my common daili task of rebuild a perish faith
and peopl let that busi be why should i speak of it sinc
destini decre that i must shape my work of water or of drift
sand not of rock or fire clai oh fate why didst thou fool me
thu oh love the destroy why didst thou make of me thy tool and
with me thu bring isi and her worship to the dust
how long afterward wa it that kallikr came but a littl while i
think though to on who ha live over two thousand year time lose
it measur and signific
i had sent philo to the coast purpos to prepar for the open up
of trade and convers with the outer world for in thi rich place
when it wild peopl were brought beneath my yoke who alreadi look
upon me as on half divin as the spirit of their ancient goddess
inde sent back to them from heaven i knew that we could produc
much that the teem tribe of libya would seek and bui on night he
return and wa at onc admit to my presenc he told me of all
that he had done or fail to do and i prais him then made the
signal of dismiss he hesit a while then said
child of isi be pleas to learn that i have not return alon
that i know alreadi philo sinc there were mani in your compani
be it understood child of isi that i have brought back with me
some with whom i did not set forth
doubtless envoi from the peopl of the coast i answer
indiffer
nai he repli travel who have wander long among those
peopl and whom i found shipwreck and in a desper state
travel from egypt
from egypt how mani philo
nine in all prophetess though the most of them ar servant
good philo it will pleas me who must dwell so much alon to talk
with stranger from egypt thei mai have new of what pass on the
nile give them hospit such as we can command and all thei need
and tomorrow after the morn ceremoni bring them to me
tonight it is too late and doubtless thei ar weari
again he hesit then bow and went leav me wonder for
there wa that in hi manner which i thought strang still have
spoken my command i would not alter them yet as i laid me down to
sleep terror took hold of me ye a terror of i knew not what i felt
that evil overshadow me with it black wing that i wa about to
look upon someth or someon i did not desir to see that a doom
unknown had mesh me so that i lai helpless like a gladiat over
whom the netthrow ha cast hi web and who li struggl vainli
the trident at hi throat thu often doe advanc peril cast it
cold shadow upon our mortal heart which shiver at the touch of that
thei feel but cannot discern
i thought that perchanc i wa about to die that alreadi death
grip me with hi clasp of ic that in the dark recess of the
chamber where i lai alreadi some murder finger the dagger which
should pierc my breast as well might happen in thi wild land among
maneat savag upon whose neck i had set my heel again i thought
that the spirit of the ancient dead whose place i occupi were
hunt me demand that i should give them back their own the rule
i had usurp
next i rememb tene transfix by the sword of vengeanc and
know now that mine wa the hand that drove it and ochu artaxerx
when the poison began to burn hi vital as present the fire would
burn hi compani guess at the last that i the outrag priestess
had brew the cup and lit the fire yea all these memori gather
round me rise like black cloud upon my sky of life and threaten
it eclips i who wa terrifi of i knew not what
lastli there came into my mind thi tale of philo of shipwreck
stranger whom he had rescu and led hither to be comfort who were
these stranger i wonder assassin perchanc hid under a disguis
of want and desol men who sought to kill me and free my spirit
with their daggerpoint that it might no longer watch them here on
earth yet and thi wa marvel show how blind ar the ey of
our mortal flesh never did the thought come to me that those
stranger might be kallikr the greek and amenarta aforetim
royal princess of egypt she whom her desir and hate had made my foe
i slept at last though feverishli onli to wake when the high sun wa
flood the templ court with it fierc summer rai i rose and
sinc the dai wa on of ceremoni and festiv wa arrai by my
women in the queenli garment of the highpriestess of isi and hung
about with the sacr jewel and emblem of my rank
thu splendidli attir i wa led to my seat of state that i had
caus to be place in the inmost pillar court befor a wondrou
veil statu of truth stand on the world which some godgift
artist of old kor had fashion in the forgotten dai here we
celebr our servic with pomp and ritual as onc we were wont to
do in egypt though ala the heiroph and the singer were few in
number so wa the outer congreg of halfconvert worshipp
creep back from the black of their barbar rite to the holi
fellowship of the goddess
the offic wa end the ring of the sistrum had ceas the
bless wa given and with it the absolut of offenc
the worshipp had dispers save here and there on who remain to
prai i too wa about to depart when philo came sai humbl and
hastili like on who desir to be done with an unwelcom task that
those wander of whom he had spoken wait upon my pleasur
admit them i answer wonder within myself upon whom i wa
about to look malefactor perchanc i thought who had fled from
justic into far land or merchant driven southward by the gale or
humbl seamen escap from some sunk ship
thei came a littl knot of them wind in and out between the great
column of the ruin templ advanc through the shadow idli i
note as thei pass an open space where fell a stronger light that
the two who walk first had a nobl air differ from that of those
who follow after them then onc more the shadow veil them
whenc present thei emerg befor me seat beneath the statu
and stood there the sun rai pour down upon them
i glanc at them and saw that thei were man and woman perfect man
and veri beauteou woman then i lift my head and look them fulli
in the face onli to sink back terrifi amaz overwhelm did i
dream had some mock spirit trick my ey or were those that
stood befor me kallikr the grecian warriorpriest and
amenarta the royal princess of egypt
lift my hand to hide my face i studi them beneath it shade oh
who could be mistaken there befor me splendid in beauti as of old
stood the godlik kallikr and at hi side dark magnific and
as yet untouch by time or perchanc protect from it ravag by
art she learn from her side nectaneb the sorcer wa the
imperi amenarta for a moment i kept silenc gather up my
strength order my spirit then still hold my hand befor my
face i spoke coldli as though without concern sai
whenc come you nobl stranger what ar your name and why do you
seek the hospit of the queen of thi ruin land of kor
bold as ever it wa amenarta who answer me not kallikr who
stood stare about him as men do when thei ar uneasi in their mind
or weari with ceremoni
we ar wander priestess in station neither mean nor great
trader to tell the truth from the far north who have suffer
shipwreck and mani other thing at length were rescu of thi servant
of your who led us here and she point to philo stand near by
with a stupid smile upon hi face
by race we ar phoenician call and she gave some name that i
forget as to the rest be in extrem for those over whom we
rule rebel against us and cast us out we ask shelter from you
until fortun smile upon us again who of late ha dealt us naught
but frown
it is grant ladi but tell me what ar you to each other brother
and sister perchanc
ay priestess brother and sister as you have rightli guess
see that our name ar on name
that is strang ladi inde i think that you throw mud upon your
father or your mother or both sinc how could these have begotten
on dark a highborn daughter of the nile and anoth fair as apollo
and have grecian apollo face and mien again how come it that
the sister of a phoenician merchant bind up her lock with the circlet
of egyptian royalti and i point to the uraeustwist band of gold
upon her brow
blood plai strang trick priestess search out now the like
of on ancestor and now of anoth so that ofttim on child is
born dark and the other fair as for the ornament i bought it in
trade from an arab merchant not know whenc it came or it
signific she began to answer unabash when of a sudden
kallikr check her mutter
have done then address me he said
o queen and priestess take no heed of thi ladi word sinc of
late becaus of our misfortun we have been forc to tell mani
strang tale accord to the condit of the hour we ar not
phoenician born of on hous we ar by blood greek and egyptian and
by relat not brother and sister but man and wife
now when i heard these word my heart stood still who hope that isi
and their oath might have held thi pair apart yet i answer
calmli
is it so wander tell me then of what faith ar you twain and by
whom were you wed did some minist of zeu join your hand or did
you stand togeth befor hathor altar
then while he search for some answer that he could not find i went
on laugh a littl
perchanc o nobl pair you were not wed at all perchanc you ar
not husband and wife but onli lover and lover mate after natur
fashion
he hung hi head confus and even the bold ey of amenarta were
troubl
now i could bear no more
o grecian kallikr i said aforetim captain of pharaoh
guard aforetim priest of isi and o amenarta daughter of
nectaneb by birth royal princ of egypt why do you wast word
hope to fool on who cannot be deceiv doubtless you have bribe
yonder philo to hide the truth as onc you bribe him to hide a
certain ladi upon hi ship and to set the two of you ashor upon a
certain island
if so he ha betrai us stammer kallikr the red blood
rise to hi brow
nai he ha not betrai you be on who ever keep faith with
those who pai him well is it not so philo my servant
i wait for an answer but none came for philo had gone then i
continu
nai philo did not betrai you nor wa it need royal amenarta
whenc had you that scarab ring upon your hand
it wa my lord gift to me she answer
then tell me kallikr whenc had you the ring also if there be
graven on it bezel in the egyptian write sign that mean royal
son of the sun
those sign ar cut upon the ring o queen which in bygon year wa
given to me as a talisman by a certain divin priestess whom i save
in battl that it virtu might recov me of wound which i
receiv in the battl thi as i wa told afterward it had the
power to do becaus that ring wa bless have been fashion like
to on which isi the mother set as her love gift upon the hand of
dead osiri er she breath hi soul into him again or perchanc it
wa the veri same that osiri left upon the earth when he pass to
heaven i know not
thu he spoke stumbl at the word like an illbr mule upon a
stoni path till weari of the tale i broke in
therefor o kallikr you in your turn gave the enchant amulet
to a woman you desir or who desir you hope that it virtu
might consecr your unhallow union o priest forsworn how did you
dare thi sacrilegeto set upon your lover hand the ring the veri
ring of isi that onc great khaemua wore given to you by the
prophetess of isi to lift you from the gate of death
then bend forward so that the shadow of the statu behind no longer
hid me i uncov my face and look him in the ey
i thought it he said though who could have dream that here in
thi ruin it is the oracl and the prophetess it is the child of
isi the daughter of wisdom herself whose voic i knew again through
all her feign and he fell to the ground so that hi brow wa
press upon it stone mutter
slai me queen and have done but spare thi ladi and send her back
to her own land sinc the sin is mine not her who wa no
priestess
now amenarta stare at me with her bold ey then cri with a hard
laugh
be not so sure my lord for thi is scarc possibl well do i
rememb look upon her who wa call isiscometoearth in the
bygon dai especi at a certain feast that pharaoh gave when she
unveil to show herself to tene king of sidon who afterward took
her as hi slave but that seeress wa a veri fair woman although
perchanc even then somewhat fade or so i who but a littl while
befor had bade farewel to childhood judg of her therefor thi
ruler of ruin can scarc be the same see that none could name
her fair look she is old and wither her neck ha fallen in her
shape is flatten
the seeress i rememb had a love mouth of coral but thi ladi
lip ar thin and pale also she had larg and beauteou ey but
those of thi ladi ar small and almost colourless moreov thei ar
ring beneath with line of black such as ar common to ag virgin
priestess who have never known the love of man though of it
perchanc their holi soul still dream even in the midst of their
customari beadcheck prayer while like those of slave their
knee harden upon the stone
nai my lord although time work strang chang in those who have
pass the meridian of their dai thi priestess who hide her grai
hair beneath the vultur cap of her persuas can scarc be the
same as the glow pytho upon whom onc we look in pharaoh
hall and who as i recal then look much on you
now i listen to thi vulgar venom the common outpour of a small
natur jealou heart and smile yet it is true for in these line
i write noth which is not the truth that some of those poison
shaft went home i knew well that all the beauti that onc i had wa
no longer mine that the pass of the year that care and
abstin and the turn of my heart from thing mortal to those
divin ad to the weight of rule and wisdom and aveng which
destini had laid upon my brow had rob me of my bloom and that
imperi loveli which onc enthral the world also it wa true
that amenarta wa still a child when i wa a woman grown and
therefor had natur vantag of me which inde must increas from
moon to moon
still i smile and as i smile a great thought smote me sow a
seed of dare in the kind soil of my breast where thenceforth it wa
doom to grow to blossom and in an unborn hour of fulfil to
bear it fear fruit oh if i have sin against high heaven and
the command of it minist my guid the holi noot let the
record god rememb that it wa the whip of thi woman bitter
tongu which drove me to the deed
now veri gentli i spoke sai
rise kallikr such word as you have heard spoken of on who
onc wa set abov you in her offic can scarc be pleas to your
ear nor will i answer them i know well that in them there is
someth of the truth and i am proud that it ha been grant to me
to make sacrific to the queen of heaven whom i ador of such small
gift of the flesh and comeli as onc were mine it is but anoth
offer which i heap upon her altar on of mani
yet kallikr though as i think you can on longer bow the knee
befor that majesti as onc you did i prai you if you can to hold
thi ladi lip from pour scorn upon her as she doe upon me her
priestess i prai you to bring it to her memori that onc clad in her
veil of isi she also worship at that shrine ay that in a time
of peril often there she and you and i have sent up our pure
petit though not in the customari beadcheck prayer of which
she speak ye bring it to her memori that though the templ of
memphi ha been given to the flame mother isi hear and watch
not in egypt but in heaven and that though she will be slow to
wrath yet she still can smite now kallikr go rest you take
your love with you and afterward we will talk alon sinc although i
can forgiv i am not mind to be stone with such word as angri
women of the peopl throw at their rival in the marketplac
chapter xxi
the truth and the temptat
not that dai but on the morrow kallikr ask audienc of me
learn that he wa alon i receiv him in my privat chamber and
bade him be seat he obei and for awhil i watch him the light
from the windowplac fall upon hi golden head and upon hi
shine armour batter with storm and war for now he wa clad in
hi soldier garb perchanc the veri same that year ago he had worn
on board the hapi and thu attir look like a king of men
the ladi amenarta is somewhat sick after all our journei he
said i think that the disord which is common on the coast land
ha fallen upon her sinc her face is flush and her hand ar hot
therefor she cannot await upon you prophetess yet she bid me thank
you for your hospit and sai that she ask your pardon for ani
bitter word she mai have spoken yesterdai sinc these sprang not
from her heart but from a fever burn in her blood
it is grant i know thi sick though myself i have been
protect from it and will send her medicin and with it a skill
woman to wait upon her bid her not to fear it is seldom danger
now my guest kallikr if it pleas you let me hear your stori
you must have much to tell sinc we part in the sanctuari at
memphi then you will rememb your purpos wa to accompani the
holi noot upon hi mission becaus you thought it best for reason of
your own to depart from memphi for a while yet i think it wa in
your mind to go alon not accompani by that royal ladi who is your
companion
thi is true prophetess he answer heavili nor did i know that
the ladi of whom you speak wa aboard the hapi until to escap
captur at the hand of the persian we had fled from the nile out
toward the open sea
i understand kallikr nor can it be deni that fate dealt
hardli or perchanc i should sai kindli with you when it caus the
ladi amenarta to embark in error upon the ship hapi which sail
down nile instead of that of her father nectaneb which set it
cours for thebe and ethiopia
mock me not child of wisdom as the ladi amenarta would tell you to
your face she knew well enough upon what ship she sail though i
knew noth who believ that i had said farewel to her for ever
ay abandon her hope of royalti and all els and take everi
risk she embark upon the hapi set some other woman trick
out to her like to fill her place awhil among the compani of
nectaneb
that at least wa bold and i love courag kallikr yetwhat
wa her purpos
is that a question that you should ask me ladi who know well that
greatheart women will dare much for love
whether i should ask or not at least i have the answer to my
question kallikr of a truth you should love and honour on who
for your sake abandon all to win what she thought more than all
even at the cost of her own shame and the ruin of your soul
i do love and honour her he answer hoars when she wa still
a child i love her and becaus of that love i slew my brother
believ that on reach womanhood she had come to favour him
which it seem she did onli to draw me closer to her
it would appear kallikr that thi ladi bring no good fortun
to your race sinc first she work the death of on of you make a
murder of hi own brother and then of that brother fashion an
apost to hi faith yea a traitor accurs from god and man
it is so he said humbl yet she love me much so much that
whether i will it or not i must love her sinc if the woman love
enough what can the man do but follow on the path she lead tell me
prophetess you who ar wise had you been a man and sat in my place
there upon the ship hapi which is a narrow prison what would you
have done be a man i saya i am
perhap just what you did kallikr and therefor have becom
accurs as you ar kallikr see that the ladi wa sweet and
love and that man must remain man howev great the oath he ha
sworn to goddess who do not throw their arm about him or kiss him
on the lip
onc i thought that a goddess did kiss me on the lip oracl of
isi and the memori of that kiss is sweet and holi
is it so i answer well sinc you ar no more of our
communion i mai tell you now that in the shrine at phila i plai
the part of the goddess and gave that ceremoni kiss
now he stare at me redden then mutter
alwai i guess it who could not quit believ that a goddess would
kiss so sweetli and again he start like on who would ask a
question that hi lip do not dare to frame
i remain silent watch him till present he broke out
you tell me that i am accurs priestess tell me also why isi is
so wrath with me
did you not swear yourself to her alon and break your oath
kallikr do you not know that if women can be jealou goddess
who ar set far abov them can be more greatli so of those who ar
bound to them in the mystic marriag have you not heard that to turn
from them to a daughter of man is to offer them the most terribl of
all insult
isi herself wa wed to osiri prophetess and i have heard of
priest and priestess who serv her who were also wed
perchanc kallikr after absolut given by on upon whom
author is confer to strain vow for some high end but who gave
you author to marri you who inde ar not marri but onli a
woman lover did you mayhap seek it from the holi noot aboard the
ship hapi
nai he answer that thought never came to me or if it came i
believ that he would but heap curs upon me or mayhap call down
the vengeanc of isi upon anoth you have heard prophetess of
what fate sometim await those who tempt the feet of priest or
priestess from the strait path of their vow
ay kallikr thei die by fire or thei starv or thei perish
shut up in some narrow airless hole each worship work it own
vengeanc for that unmeasur crime yet you were foolish not to make
your prayer of noot by whom alon it could be grant sinc who
know what he would have answer
is it too late he ask eagerli for everi sin there is
forgiv why not for mine onli who could grant it sinc now i
know not where to look for noot if inde he live
for everi sin there is forgiv kallikr but onli at a price
first the sin itself must be laid upon the altar as a sacrific for
dead sin there mai be forgiv for those that live and ar
continu there is none but onli stripe ad to stripe and remors
pile upon remors as for noot it chanc that he doe live and not
so far awai would you lai your case befor him and hear hi
judgment
i do not know he answer slowli hearken child of wisdom i am
in a strang strait i love thi ladi with my bodi and am bound to
her but it is not so with my spirit our soul i think ar far
apart oh bear me wit that my heart is set on higher thing it
would sail into far sea unvisit of man but alwai there is thi
anchor of the flesh chain it to it nativ shore amenarta doe
not think thu she love to lie bound in life pleasant harbour or
to wander to it green bank waft thither by the fit breath of
common thing there to deck her brow with the wreath of passion
let heaven be she sai here is the happi earth beneath our feet
and round us murmur the water of delight and i am veri beauti and
i love you well if there be god and thei ar veng at least
their hour is not yet thi moment is our to enjoi and to our lip it
hold a gloriou cup if all the wine be drunk and the cup is
shatter at least there will remain with us their memori what ar
these god whom you seek so madli what do thei give to man save mani
cursesdeath and separ sick and sorrow ad to
these promis of woe to follow when thei have work their worst on
earth ar there ani god save those that man fashion from hi own
terror man who will not be content with natur food but need
must sour it with an alien poison and even when the sun shine round
him shiver in some cold shadow that superstit cast upon hi
heart
thu she reason and such ever were her argument
tell me kallikr ha ani child been born to you
ay on a veri love child he di of hardship that caus hi
mother milk to fail
and when the royal amenarta look upon him dead did she still
reason in thi fashion sai that there ar no god and for man
there is no hope beyond the grave
not altogeth sinc she curs the god and who curs that in
which thei do not believ also i rememb that she wept and prai
those god to give him back to her while hi littl heart still beat
and like a moth newcrept from it chrysali he yet hung to the edg
of the world dry hi soul crinkl wing in the dawn light
of heaven but afterward she forgot and made sacrific to her familiar
spirit ask it to send her anoth child which prayer she tell me
is in the wai of fulfil
so amenarta practic magic like her father nectaneb
ay ladi and it would seem not without avail though of thi matter
of deal with daemon i neither know nor want to know anyth i
think it come to her with her egyptian blood also that the pharaoh
taught her these art in her childhood and what is learnt then is
never quit forgotten at least i know that when we have been in
troubl or in danger dure our long wander with secret rite
upon which i do not pry she call upon some familiar and that
thereaft in thi wai or in that our pathwai ha been straighten
inde she did thi just befor philo found us starv
as the path of your babe wa straighten from thi world to the
next kallikr as the deviou path of pharaoh nectaben wa
straighten to a road which led from the throne of egyptbut prai
the ladi amenarta to ask of her daemon whither it led sinc here my
wisdom fail me and i am not sure well we have spoken long and so
stand the case on that might puzzl thoth himself is it your
pleasur kallikr to visit the divin noot and take hi counsel
upon all these matter i think that he alon upon the earth can give
you guidanc in them yet do as you will
kallikr thought a while brood then he answer
ye it is my pleasur when amenarta is recov of her sick
we will go
the holi noot is veri ancient and the royal amenarta mai be sick for
a long while therefor might it be wise to go at onc kallikr
nai prophetess i cannot amenarta ha strang fanci and will not
be left alon she think that she mai be poison inde that
alreadi she ha tast poison
then let her make richer sacrific to her daemon and prai him to
protect her certainli thei will not be without avail sinc i can
swear that here in kor no poison shall pass her lip nor ani harm
come to hersav perchanc from those god whom she deni farewel
kallikr
he bow to me humbl and turn to go then after a step or two came
back and said
the god the god who for you and me in their sum ar on god
isi queen of heaven tell me now i prai you that ar name wisdom
daughter who and what is isi
i thought a while sinc the question wa a great on a problem that
as yet i had never tri to solv in word then i answer
by my soul i do not know east and west and north and south men in
their million worship thi god or that yet is there on among them
who save in dream or ecstasi ha ever seen hi god or if he tri
to fashion him out befor hi mortal ey can do more than carv some
effigi of wood or stone
then i point to the veil statu of truth behind me sai
lo there is isi a beauteou thing with a hidden face rule oer
the world she is on of divin thousand form ay she is it
essenc frozen to the shape we know in thi world ici air and
have a counten chisel differ from ag to ag by the
chang thought of man she live in everi soul yet in no two soul
is she the same she is not yet etern she is invis
intang ever pursu and ever flee never seen and never
handl yet she answer prayer and her throne is not in the high
heaven but in the heart of everi creatur that draw the breath of
life on dai we shall behold her and not know her yet she will know
us such is isi formless yet in everi form dead yet live in all
that breath a priestbr phantasi yet the on great truth
if isi be thu what of the world other god
thei all ar isi and isi is them all the thousand god men worship
ar but on god wear mani face or rather thei ar two god the
god of good and the god of evil horu and typhon who war continu
for the soul of thing creat by that divin unseen unknown yet
etern exist who reign beyond the star alon in fear glori
and from hi nameless habit look down both on god and men the
puppet of hi hand on the roll world that bear them on the
sea of space between and on the infus spirit whose oper is
the breath of life so it wa in the begin is now and shall be
etern at least kallikr thu i have been taught by the
wisdom of noot my master and follow hi path thu my search
soul ha learn again farewel
he look at me mutter
child of isi oh wellnam child of isi and wisdom daughter
and there wa aw in hi ey and voic
now as ever he is afraid of me i thought to myself and how can a man
come to love that of which he is afraid sinc love and fear ar
opposit and there is no bridg between them oh why did i speak to
him of these high thing which as yet hi spirit can scarc weigh or
understand perhap becaus i am so lone and have naught into
which i can pour my mind no vase of gold and alabast my deep
oerflow thought must fill the first coars cup of clai that chanc
offer to my hand like to the store of priceless wine in some tarri
bottl which it will burst
sure i should learn a lesson from yonder amenarta who know well
how to deal with such a on as he on who still stand at thought
begin look dismai at the steep upward path stud with
sharp stone wreath in cruel thorn strewn with quicksand and
with pitfal and border by precipic from whose gulf there is no
return that path which hi feet long to tread yet dare not lack
ani guid
she lead him by a differ road the road of mortal passion bid
him to ceas from stare at the star bid him weav crown of
it heavysc flower to set upon her brow and hi she prattl
to him of daili do of the joi of yesterdai and the promis of
tomorrow ay even of the food he eat and all the time she twist
the spell her father taught her to strong rope of charm purpos
by these to tie him to her everlastingli ay like a gild spider
that blackbrow bounteousbreast witch mesh him in her magic
web bind him fast and yet more fast till at length he li there
stare at her stirless as a mummi in it wrap
thu i muse cloth my muse fine yet know in my heart that
what prompt them wa the vilest of all caus and the most common
naught inde but the jealousi of on woman of anoth for now i knew
the truth it could no more be hidden no longer could i blind my
ey for it had come home to me while he told me hi sad stori i
love thi man ye and had alwai love him sinc first i look
upon him far awai at phila or certainli sinc veil in the
wrap of the goddess i had yield to natur prompt and
kiss him upon the lip
oh i had beaten down that truth i had buri it deep but now it
aros like a ghost from the grave and frighten me with it stern
immort ey i love thi man and must alwai love him and no other
and hehe fear yet ador me as some high spirit is ador at it
appearingbut love me he did not who wa set so far abov him
ye i wa jealou if the great can be truli jealou of that which is
small for though we were wide apart as contin from contin yet
we both were women desir of on man with my spirit i wa not
jealou for that i knew must conquer in the end be so strong so
armour against all the shaft of mortal chang yet with my flesh i
wa jealou he told me amenarta had born a son to him that she
hope to bear anoth son andi too yearn to be the mother of hi
son for is it not true that by a fix unchang law wherea the
man love the woman for herself the woman love the man most of all
becaus he mai becom the father of her child and thu by the marvel
of creation even in the dust preserv her from perpetu death
so so let me think i love thi man and would take him for myself
and would lift him up and would make him my equal if that could ever
be and would teach him gloriou thing and would show him the secret
light that burn within my heart and would guid him onward by the
rai of my own peculiar star how could it be brought about yonder
woman wrap round with the twicedip tyrian purpl of king
which purpl be it admit she wore well enough although now she
lack a throne whereon to drape it thought in her folli that i had
poison or would poison her ye she knew ayesha so littl that she
believ that like a persian eunuch she would stoop to call deadli
venom to her aid and therebi rid her of a rival never if i could not
win by my own strength in a fair fight for favour then let me fail
who deserv defeat were her life so utterli in my hand that i could
destroi it with a wish that wish would never form itself within my
mind and certainli never shape itself to deed
what then could be done she wa right i began to grow old time
acid wa gnaw at me so that my beauti wa no more what it had been
ay i grew spare and old while on her still shone the full glori of
her womanhood if i would conquer i must ceas from grow old
the fire of life ah that fire of life which gave it wa said the
gift of undi dai and of perfect youth and loveli such as
aphrodit herself might envi who said so noot the master who knew
all thing yet noot had never enter into that fire therefor how
did he know unless it were by revel at least he had forbidden
me to tast it cup perhap becaus he wa sure that it would slai me
whom he desir to be hi successor and to establish here a great
kingdom whereof the peopl should accept isi as their god
still the stori might be true for otherwis why did noot sit in that
melancholi hermitag watch the pathwai to the fire there had been
other tale of the same sort told in the world thu the old chaldean
legend spoke of a tree of life that grew in a certain garden whenc
the parent of mankind were driven lest thei should eat of it and
becom immort which legend wa expound to me more fulli by the
jewish rabbi in jerusalem and afterward by holli the learn man
therefor it seem that there wa a tree of life or a fire of life
jealous guard of the god lest the children of men should becom
their equal and i i knew where that tree grew or rather where that
fire burn yet noot forbad it to me and could i disobei noot my
master noot the half divin well noot wa veri old and near hi
end and when he di i by hi own appoint should be the
guardian of the fire and mai not a guardian tast of that he guard
the god decre otherwis he said mayhap but what if in thi
matter where i had so much to gain i chose to match myself against
the god if the god give knowledg can thei be wrath with those who
us it yet if thei ar wrathwel let them be wrath and set their
worst against my best sometim i grew weari of the god and all the
fantast decre which theyor their priestsheap upon the
head of the suffer of thi earth were not life curs and
death doom enough to satisfi their appetit that thei must load
the toil dai between with so much of the lead of miseri deni
thi deni that strow the path of men with spike and crown
their head with thorn
if noot tale were true what then i should enter the fire i should
emerg everglori beauteou beyond imagin and ever young
have left death far behind me i should need but to wait a while
until amenarta di and when she wa dead or have grown weari of
dull life in an ancient place had depart to seek some other nai
for then in the first case kallikr also would be dead or ancient
and in the second certainli she would take him with her
ah now i had it if i enter the fire and came forth unharm
kallikr must enter it after me for then we should be fitli mate
even if we must wait until a littl pinch of the sand of time had run
out from between our finger yet suppos that amenarta chose to
enter it also as be so fond of magic and so determin to cling to
that which she had won perchanc she might do would my case be
better the plai would be set upon a larger stage that is all
well should i not be the guardian of the fire and would it not be in
my hand to determin who should tast or who should be deni it
glori let that matter decid itself when the hour came sinc the
decis would be such as i and not as amenarta will
here then wa my plan and yeton thought more what if the fire
slew if so had i found life so sweet that i should be afraid to die
as in ani case within some few year die i must let me take my chanc
of death who wa readi to fade awai into a land where kallikr and
amenarta and all earthli miseri and all baulk desir and
ambit and all hope and fear and suffer must be forgot onli
would thei be forgot perchanc there thei might be rememb and
pierc the soul etern with an even keener edg noot believ that
we were made of an immort stuff and so at heart did i it must be
risk what is life but a long risk and why should we fear to add to
it tremend count i at least did not fear
so all wa sum up and balanc yet from my reckon i left out
the largest charg that which fate make against those who plai at
dice with the unknown the god mai smile at courag and pass a
ventur by but who can tell how blind fate will aveng the forc of
hi rule decre and the rape of knowledg from hi secret store
thi problem i forgot i who wa doom to learn it answer
chapter xxii
bewar
the dai went by and it wa not long befor amenarta recov from
her sick long at least befor she would appear out of the
lodg the best at our command which had been given to her it wa
an ancient ruin hous near to the templ that doubtless onc had
been a splendid place inhabit by forgotten nobl of old kor there
were garden round it or rather what had been garden for now these
were much overgrown and in their shelter amenarta hid herself and
wander never leav them to visit me
yet kallikr came often though be unshriven and thrust out of
our commun by hi own act he did not share in the worship of the
goddess often i would see him as our process wound in and out of
the column of the great unroof templ hall stand afar off and
gaze at it wistfulli ay and onc when it pass near to him i
saw too that there were tear upon hi face note which my heart
sorrow for him who wa an outcast for a woman sake
when these ceremoni were end he would visit me in my chamber
where we talk long and of mani thing i ask him why the princess
amenarta who it seem wa recov of her fever sinc now she
could wander in her garden ground laid no offer on the altar of
the goddess he answer
becaus she will have naught to do with the god of egypt who she
sai if thei ar at all have ever been the enemi of her hous and
have drag her father the pharaoh nectaneb from hi throne and
hurl him forth a discrown fugit to perish amidst stranger
upon those who follow after spell and affront the god the god
will be aveng kallikr for everi sin there is forgiv save
for that of the denial of divin and of the set of evil in it
place to be propiti by the art of sorcer moreov did not
thi nectaneb offer deadli insult to the queen of heaven when he
gave me her servant and seeress to be a slave to tene the
worshipp of her worst of foe baal and ashtoreth and moloch that
tene from whose grip you help to save me kallikr
it is so he answer sadli
and now i went on the daughter follow in the father step oh
i am sure that yonder she spell out her charm aim her
enchant at my heart whenc thei fall back harmless as the bone
tip arrow of wild men fall from a shield of syrian bronz
he hung hi head who knew well that my word were true and mutter
ala she love you not ladi who from the first hour that she set
ey upon you as often she ha told me fear and hate you
becaus she sai her spirit warn and ha ever warn her that you
will bring disast upon her head and call up death to keep her
compani
at least he would be a better guest kallikr than the daemon
that like her father she harbour in her breast oh unhappi man my
heart bleed for you who ar link to thi poison loveli that
divorc you from hope and chariti to thi royal infidel who in the
end will bind your spirit wing and drag you down into her own
dark for your soul sake i prai you kallikr seek out the
holi noot confess your sin and hear hi counsel sinc thi matter
is beyond my strength and i have none to give seek him soon nai at
onc er perchanc it be too late for i learn that he grow feebl
that is my great desir priestess yet how can i who know not where
to find him
i will be your guid kallikr when the sun rise on the second
dai from now we will march to visit noot in hi secret dwell
i will be readi he answer and left me
on the morrow he came again and we spoke togeth of the state of kor
and of my plan for better it also of certain savag who
threaten us from without maneat tribe that it seem were
descend from the apost who reject the worship of truth or
lulala as isi wa name by them in those time had adopt that of
a devil that as thei declar inhabit the sun or some illomen
star
kallikr listen he who at bottom wa ever a soldier for the
tale awok all hi gener craft and courag as a great captain
doe he balanc the reason for or against defenc for or against
attack he question me as to the number of my peopl and of their
foe as to their arm and mani other matter that have to do with
war then have learn all that i could tell him he set out the
plan which he judg to be the best in our condit talk of it
long and eagerli he who for a while had forgot hi woe i listen
to him watch hi bright and splendid face which seem as that of
the sungod of the greek speak a word here and a word there i
listen think to myself the while that if onli he and i he with
hi skill and courag and i with my wisdom could guid the destin
of kor befor our dai wa done we would drive them like the chariot
of a conquer king from egypt border to these of the uttermost
southern sea set nation after nation beneath our feet and
build up such an empir as libya had never known
what had i dream to egypt border why should we stop at her
border why should we not hurl forth the foul persian swarm and be
crown monarch of the world at susa and at thebe yet it would take
time and life is short and yonder not so far awai burn the fire
of immort and i i held the kei to it prison hous or soon
should hold it when noot had sought hi rest almost these burn
thought these high ambit in whose fulfil lai the seed of
peac attain through war and the promis of the welfar of the
earth burst from my lip in a torrent of hot word which i knew well
would set hi soul aflam but i ayesha refrain myself from
myself i wrap myself in silenc i said to myself wait wait
the ripe hour ha not dawn
he rose to depart then turn and said
at the sunris i will be here or rather he ad doubtfulli we
will be here sinc amenarta desir to accompani us upon thi
journei to visit the holi noot
by whom i trust she will be well receiv see the manner in which
she part from him upon the ship hapi well so be it i rejoic to
learn that the royal amenarta again find herself prepar to travel
yet remind her kallikr that the road we go is rough and
danger
she shall be told yet it will serv littl sinc who can turn
amenarta from her end not i be sure nor could her father befor
me nor ani live man
nai nor ani god kallikr sinc the end she follow ar those
of neither man nor god but of someth that stand beyond them both
as wa the case of pharaoh nectaneb who begot her each of us shoot
at hi chosen mark kallikr you at your i at mine and
amenarta at her own therefor what right have we to judg of on
anoth archeri let her come to visit noot and i prai that she mai
return the happier
next morn er the dawn i stood at the templ porch await philo
and the litter came amenarta cloak heavili for the air wa cold
yet splendid even in those wrap
greet wisdom child she said bow in her courtlik fashion
i learn that you and my husband would make some strang journei and
therefor as a wife should i accompani him
that is so royal ladi though i knew not that you were wed to the
lord kallikr
what is marriag she ask is it certain word mumbl befor an
altar and a priest a thing of wit ceremoni or is it the union
of the heart and flesh accord to natur custom and decre but
let that pass where my lord goe there i accompani him
none forbid you o ladi of egypt
true prophetess yet my own heart forbid me know that but last
night i wa haunt by a veri evil dream it seem to me that my
father nectaneb stood befor in a sabl robe that wa shot through
with thread of fire he spoke to me sai daughter bewar of that
witch who goe on a dread quest take with her on who is dear to
you at the end of that quest li doom for her for him for you
though each of these doom be differ
it mai be so princess i answer coldli then accompani me not
and keep kallikr at your side
that i cannot do she said in a sullen voic sinc now for the
first time he will not listen to my plead and cross my will you
have laid your charm upon him as on other in the past and where you
lead he follow
mayhap as a slave follow on who can show him where he mai loos hi
chain but let us not bandi word royal amenarta i depart follow
if you will or bide behind on or both of you see here come
kallikr agre togeth as it pleas you
she turn and met him in the ruin of the ancient pylon where thei
debat togeth in word i could not hear onc she seem to
conquer for both of them walk a littl wai toward their own home
then kallikr swung round upon hi heel and came back to me who
stood by the litter she hesit awhil ah what mighti issu
hung upon thi trembl of the balanc of her mind but in the end
she follow him
after thi without more speech we enter the litter and began our
journei
as we went across the misti plain it came home to me as mani a time
it ha done dure the long centuri that follow how often the
great depend upon the littl anoth bitter word from amenarta a
trifl less of courag in kallikr and how differ would fate
have fashion the destini of everi on of us for be it rememb
that the choic lai with these two i did naught save wait upon their
will had thei so desir never need thei have enter those
litter alon i should have depart alon i should have look upon
the fire and drunk of that cup of life or perchanc as is probabl
i should have left it untast and gone down my wai to death after the
common fashion of mankind but it wa not so decre of their own
desir thei took the path to doom though perchanc that desir wa
shape by some strength abov their own
we reach the precipic and climb it amenarta kallikr philo
and i we pass the cave by the light of lantern and we came to the
trembl spur of rock that reach out like a great needl thrust
through the robe of dark when thei look upon it kallikr
and amenarta shiver and drew back see which i rejoic for it
is true that at the moment i found no more heart for thi adventur
stai where you ar i cri and wait i go to visit the holi noot
i will return again and if i return not within a round of the sun
then make your wai back to kor and there abid or if it pleas you
seek the coastland and the harbour of the ethiopian head and depart
with the help of philo if he still live or if not otherwis
farewel i go
nai cri kallikr whither you lead prophetess thither i
follow
if so said amenarta laugh in her royal fashion you will not
follow alon what shall i not dare that which my lord can dare is
thi the first peril in which we twain have stood side by side if it
be the last what of it
so we start down the spur philo come at the end of our line and
though with mani hazard for onc the brain of amenarta swam so that
almost she fell reach it point in safeti here we wait crouch
upon the rough rock and cling to it with our hand lest it quick
throb should hurl us into the gulf or the fierc gust should
sweep us awai like autumn leav
at length at the appoint moment the swordlik sunset rai appear
strike full upon us and show that the frail bridg of board wa
still in the place for it swai and move like the deck of a ship at
sea
be bold and follow i cri sinc he who hesit is doom and
instantli i step across that peril plank and took my stand upon
the swai stone beyond
for a moment kallikr stood doubt as well he might but
amenarta push past him and with a laugh cross it as though she
would teach me that i wa not the onli on to whom the god had given
courag i caught her by the hand then kallikr follow becaus
he must and she caught him by the hand and after him philo the
seaman calmli enough so that now all four of us stood togeth on
the stone
glad enough am i to be here prophetess cri kallikr though
in that wail wind hi voic reach me onli as a whisper yet i
know not why it come into my mind that i go upon my last journei
i made no answer becaus hi fate word chill my heart and choke
my voic onli i look at hi face and note that it wa white as ic
even in the red light of the rai and that hi larg ey shone as
though with the fire of fever
take kallikr by the hand and motion to philo to do likewis
with amenarta i led him to the littl roughhewn stair by thi
stair we descend into the shelter place that wa in front of the
hermitag of noot and rejoic wa i to find myself and the other out
of the reach of those rage wind and to see that light burn
within the cave beyond
bide here all of you i said i will enter the cave and prepar
the holi noot for your come
i enter the place think to find that strang dwarf who wa noot
servant but nowher could he be seen yet i wa sure that he must be
near sinc on the rough rock were set food and wooden platter four
platter as though await four guest i thought to myself that
doubtless the master had seen us creep down the spur or perchanc
hi spirit had warn him of our comingwho could sai
i gaze about me to find noot and at length in the deep shadow out
of reach of the lamp rai i perceiv him kneel befor that
imag of isi whereof i have told and wrapt in earnest prayer i drew
near and wait a while who did not dare to break in upon hi orison
still he did not stir or look up so quiet wa he that he might have
been carv in ivori i bent forward examin hi face lo hi ey
were fix and open and hi jaw had fallen
noot wa dead
my master my most belov master too late too late i moan and
bend down kiss him on hi brow of ic
then i began to think and swiftli had he not warn me when i bade
him farewel a while befor that we spoke togeth for the last time
where wa my faith who had forgotten that the propheci of noot were
alwai true so he had gone to hi rest in the bosom of osiri and on
me had fallen hi mantl i ayesha wa the guardian of the fire of
life whereof alon i knew the secret and held the kei the knowledg
struck me like a blow i trembl and sank to the ground i think that
for a littl while i swoon and in that swoon strang dream took
hold of me halfrememb dream dream not to be written
present i rose and go to the doorwai summon the other who
stood there huddl togeth like sheep befor a storm
enter i said and thei obei now be seat and eat i went on
point to the tabl on which the food wa readi
where is the master of the feast prophetess where is the holi noot
whom we have walk thi fear road to see ask kallikr
stare about him
yonder i answer point to the depth of the shadow yonder
dead and cold you tarri too long at kor kallikr now you must
seek hi counsel and hi absolut at anoth tablethat of osiri
thu i spoke for someth inspir the word yet er thei had left
my lip i could have bitten out the tongu that shape them wa
thi the place to talk of the tabl of osiri to the man i love
thei went to that dark nook where the littl sacr statu look down
upon it quiet worshipp thei stare in silenc thei return
philo mutter prayer kallikr wring hi hand for he had
love and honour noot abov ani man that live alsoi read the
question in hi mindto whom now should he confess hi sin who now
could loos their burden
onli amenarta ponder a space then she spoke with a slow and
meaning smile sai
perchanc my lord it is as well that thi old highpriest ha come
to discov whether he dream true dream for so mani year upon the
earth i know not what you would have said to him yet i can guess
that it bode but littl good to me your wife for so i am whatev
yonder priestess mai tell you who also bode littl good either to me
or to you my lord kallikr well he is dead and even wisdom
daughter there cannot bring him back to life so let us rest a while
and eat and then return by that dread road which we have trodden er
our strength and spirit fail us
that you mai not do princess amenarta until the sunset come again
and onc more the red rai show us where to set our feet for to
attempt it sooner is to die i answer and went on
hearken by the death of thi holi man or halfgod i have becom
the keeper of a certain treasur over which he watch it is hidden
deep in the bowel of the earth beneath us i must go to visit it and
see that it is safe thi i shall do present bide you here if you
will till i return and if i return not wait till the rai strike
upon the point of rock cross the bridg climb the spur and flee
whither you will philo can guid you
not so child of isi said philo my oath and duti ar to you not
to thi pair whither you go i follow to the end
i follow also said kallikr who would not be left in thi
darksom place compani by death
yet it might be wiser kallikr i answer sinc who can
escap that compani of death of which you speak for again dread
and omin word rush unbidden from my heart
i care not i go he said almost sullenli
then i go also broke in amenarta thi prophetess doubtless is
wise and holi yet i mai be pardon if i choos to share her
fellowship with you upon a road unknown perchanc it ha anoth gate
elsewher that i might never find she ad in bitter jest
oh had thi fool but known that her coars stab at me did but harden
the heart which she sought to pierc and drive it whither she did not
desir
as you will i answer now eat and rest till the hour of
departur come and i summon you
so thei at if not much though for my own part i touch no food
and laid them down in the inner cave as best thei might and there
slept or did not sleep but i i watch the hour awai by the dead
shell of the holi noot strive to commun with hi spirit which i
knew to be near to me yet it gave no answer to all my question or
at least there came on onli which again and again seem to shape
itself to a singl word
bewar
strang thought i to myself that the prophet noot my master who
love me better than ani other live upon the earth and knew the
most of my lone wayward heart now that he wa justifi and made
perfect as doubtless he must be if such a lot can be attain by
man should find no more to sai to me than thi on word which inde
while in the flesh often he had said befor therefor it seem that
in the flesh and out of it hi counsel wa the same on certainli
that i should take
what did it mean that i should look no more upon the fire that i
should rise up and get me back to kor and there plai such part as i
could compass and wither and grow old and die nurtur perchanc
the children of kallikr and amenarta should thei seek the shade
befor me or grow weari of barbarian and ruin flee awai from
kor to find the fellowship of instruct men
that is what thi counsel meant well what did that of my own heart
promis me perhap a swift death and after it punish in some dim
land beyond becaus i had disobei the shadowi caution of the
holi noot and dare to make trial of a new strength against which as
yet no man had match himself or perhap a glori greater than ani
man had ever dream and a power far abov that of emperor and a
life longer than that of mountain also moremor the love that i
desir to me a greater guerdon than all these boon ad togeth
and multipli by the snowflak upon lebanon or the sand of the
seashor sure come what might of it i would take my own counsel
and let the other be
the hour came although i saw it not i knew that it wa that of dawn

and the odour of it the great chang began
that ayesha wa on who dream of heavenli thing on with whom
prayer wa a constant habit of the mind ye all her thought were
mix with the leaven of prayer so that the humblest deed and the
most common of imagin were by it sanctifi she knew that here
wa not her home but that far awai and out of sight beyond the sea
and mountain of the world her everlast hous rose white and
state and that with her earthli toil and suffer she built it
stone by stone fill it hall and portico with ivori statu of
the god make it pure with cloud of incens that their perfect
soul brood on her soul drew from it as at dawn the sun draw mist
from river
with grief and toil with bleed feet buffet by the wind of
circumst wet with the rain of tear wash by the water of
repent she climb the stoni upward path that led to the peak of
peac she believ in she knew not what for alwai to her those god

wa in the wai of holi and befor her shone the golden guerdon of
redempt
but now what wa ayesha now when she had known the embrac of the
spirit of fire when she had dare the deed and wrung the secret from
hi burn heart ay when on the earth she had attain to
immort sinc even then a voic cri in her ear
behold thou shalt not die behold while the world live with it
thou shalt live also becaus thou hast drunk of the wine of earth
primev soul that cannot be spill until it mighti fabric is

he wheel about he flung himself into the arm of amenarta thei
close around him and held him fast then i threw out my will sai
noth i laid my strength upon him so that he wa drag from out
those arm and with slow step drew near to me as the bird draw near
to the snake that charm it with it bale ey amenarta leap

and veri bitterli she wept yet my heart new steel in yonder fire
felt no piti for her an hour past i should have bade him go hi wai
and to look upon my face no more but now it wa otherwis i wa
cruel cruel as death king of the world the wild beast doe not

till at last mad took hold of that torment man he rave he
curs us both he curs himself who had left the quiet hall of
isi who had spurn the love divin to seek the arm of woman he
prai to isi to be piti to forgiv to receiv hi soul and

in my grasp ay the might of hercul himself that the sword flew
far and the strong man who held it reel round and round and fell
we stood aghast think that he wa sped yet he rose the red blood
run from hi beast and in a quiet voic a littl laugh upon hi
lip said to amenarta not to me

i heard and it seem to me that i stood alon in the midst of a great
silenc while those cruel word divorc me from hope fell on by
on upon me like icedrop from the sky cut to brain and heart
and freez me to stone then of a sudden rage possess me such
rage as natur know in her fiercest mood and i spoke as it gave me
word sai
i call down death upon thee kallikr the greek death be thy
portion and the grave thy home becaus thou hast reject me becaus
thou hast offer me insult to my face it is my will that thou mayest
die it is my desir that thy name be blot out from the roll of
life die then kallikr that thine ey mai torment me no more
and that i mai learn to mock thy memori
thu i spoke those word of doom in my mad though what conceiv
them in my heart i do not know there thei sprang up suddenli at the
touch of the wand of evil such evil as until now i had never dream
lo in a moment thei fulfil themselv there befor my ey that
man di smitten of the dominion over death that wa the fire
fatal gift to me as now all unprepar instantli i learn ye
the first servic that i made of my dread majesti wa to hurl that
aw doom at the heart of the man i love

he stood upon hi feet and spoke though even then i knew that it wa
not he who spoke but some spirit possess hi flesh hi lip did
not move hi ey were glass hi voic wa not the voic of
kallikr nai nor the voic of mortal man yet he spoke or seem
to speak and these were the word he said
woman known on earth as ayesha daughter of yarab but in the under
world by mani anoth name hearken to thy fate here where thou hast
betrai thy trust here where thou didst slai the man of thy desir
here through long ag shalt thou abid undi until in the ful
of time he return to thee o ayesha in lone bitter shalt thou
abid tear shall be thy drink and remors thy bread the power that
thou didst crave shall be but a blunt unus sword within thine
hand thy kingdom shall be a desol thy subject barbarian and
from centuri to centuri thy companion shall be the dead
the voic ceas and i answer it ask
and when the return tide of time bear thi man back to me what
then o spirit is all hope pass from me o spirit
no answer came but that which had been kallikr sank in a huddl
heap upon the sand
chapter xxiv
the counsel of philo
roar like a whirlwind shout triumphantli onc more the wheel
of fire roll on it tremend cours i watch it come i watch
it go while in it i thought i saw grin elflik face that
gibber at me and thrust out tongu of deris it depart on it
secret journei through the bowel of the world it thunder sank to
mutter it mutter to silenc while i said to my heart that
could i be sure that it would slai i would cast myself beneath it
chariot wheel
to what purpos sinc then as i believ in those dai in the
flame i should find but ad lifei who could not die
it wa gone naught remain save the cave carpet with white sand
and the rosi light plai on the bodi of the dead kallikr nai
amenarta remain also and i becam awar that she wa curs me by
all her god or rather by those who had been her god befor she
turn her face from them seek the counsel of familiar spirit
brave she curs and long call down upon my head everi evil that
can be found in heaven abov or earth beneath she who did not know
that thi wa needless for alreadi the wing furi had made it
their restingplac and befor thei could be utter all her
imprec were fulfil
have done i said when at length she grew weak and weari and let
us summon philo to help us bear thi nobl clai to some fit
sepulchr
nai witch she answer us your magic on me also if you can
slai the wife as you have slain the husband and here let us rest
etern what tomb can be better for both of us than that which saw
our murder
have done i repeat you know well that i have no desir to kill
you and that it wa my mad not my will that brought doom on
kallikr whom we love i who had not learn that henceforth my
spirit is a bow wing with deadli shaft
i went down the cave and through the passag that lai beyond and from
it mouth call to philo to follow me
he came and perceiv my new loveli as i stood await him in
the rosi light fell to the ground kiss my feet and the hem of my
robe and mutter
o isiscometoearth o queen divin
rise up and follow me i said and led him to where lai kallikr
by whom knelt the widow amenarta weep bitterli
overwhelm with the sight of glori ala thi lord ha slain
himself i said and point to the wound in the dead man breast
whenc still the blood ooz drop by drop
nai thi witch slew him moan amenarta but if philo heard her
word he took no heed of them
then at my command the three of us lift kallikr and bore him
thenc up the difficult wai which never could we have done had i not
discov that now in my woman shape that seem so frail and weak
wa hid unmeasur strength
so through the cave and up the wind slope and stair we bore the
dead kallikr bring him back to the hermitag of noot but a
littl befor the hour of sunset here i command amenarta and philo
to eat and drink though myself i need neither food nor wine while
thei did so aid of thi new strength of mine i lift the bodi of
noot from where it knelt and laid it down cross the hand upon the
breast and have cover it with a robe left him to hi last sleep
these thing finish we carri kallikr to the crest of the
swai stone and wait the come of the rai suddenli it shone
out and in it fierc light we dare the shift bridg beneath a
weight which it wa ill design to bear the frail thing broke just
as amenarta and philo bear the feet of the dead man had found
foot upon the point of the spur beyond it seem that i should
have fallen yet i fell not who i know not how found myself at
their side still support kallikr in my arm
then it wa that first i learn that as i wa protect from the
gnaw of the tooth of time so also i wa armour against all the
stroke of chanc thi inde becam veri clear to me in the after
dai thu onc when the roof of a cave fell upon me and other thei
were slain but i remain unbruis and again when a deadli snake
bit me it poison harm me not at all but what of these thing
which ar not worthi to be chronicl see that if i could die in
the pass of two thousand year and more what men call mishap must
long sinc have brought me to my end
we bore kallikr down the spur and through the cavern whenc it
spring till at length we found the litter wait for us and in
on of these we laid hi quiet form
thu at length we came back to kor at the hour of the dawn
again we lift up the corps of kallikr and carri it to the
chamber where i slept a thought came to me
philo i said did you not tell me that among those who serv us in
thi templ ar certain ag medicinemen who declar that knowledg
of the art wherebi the peopl of old kor preserv their dead from
corrupt ha come down to them which art thei still practis from
time to time
it is so o queen for so he name me now there ar three of
them
good summon them philo and bid them bring with them their
instrument and spice
awhil later the three appear veri ag cunninglook men who
had upon their hawknos face the stamp of high and ancient blood i
point to the bodi of kallikr and ask
ar ye abl to hold back thi holi flesh from the foul finger of
decai
if he be not more than forti hour dead answer on of them we
can do so in such fashion that when five thousand year have pass it
will seem as it doe at thi hour o queen
then to your offic slave and know that if ye do as ye have
promis ye shall receiv great reward but if ye lie to me ye die
we do not lie o queen he said
forthwith thei set a fire outsid the chamber and thereon set a larg
earthen pot in thi pot mix with water thei place dri leav
of a certain shrub in shape long and narrow and boil them to a
broth whereof the pungent colour seem to fill all the air about
while the pot wa boil thei took the corps of kallikr and
have wash it brush it everywher with some secret stuff that
gave to it the aspect of white and shine marbl then thei brought a
funnel of clai with a curv point and have open the great arteri
of the throat insert the point into the arteri
thi done thei stood the stiff corps on it feet and while two of
them held it thu the third brought the pot into which thei pour
stuff that look like glass when it is molten mix all togeth
with a rod of stone then he set a ladder perhap four pace in
length against the wall and carri the pot climb to the top of
it whenc slowli he pour the brew into the funnel beneath so that
it weight forc it through all the dead man vein when the most
of it wa gone he descend and the three of them finish their work
in some wai that i did not stai to watch for the sight of thi grim
prepar for the tomb and the scent of these spici drug overcam
me
at length thei summon me and show me kallikr ly like to on
in a deep sleep calm and beauti as he had been in life
o queen said their spokesman by tomorrow at the sunris the
flesh of thi man will be as marbl and so everlastingli remain then
bear him where you will but till then let him rest untouch
i bade that thei should be reward and thei went their wai but
first i ask them where the inhabit of old kor were wont to lai
their royal dead thei answer that it wa in the great cave at a
littl distanc across the plain and i command that on the morrow
thei should guid me thither bear the bodi of kallikr
philo came and said that the priest and priestess of isi would
have speech with me and that thei were gather in the inmost court of
the great templ befor the veil statu of the goddess truth i bade
him lead on but he waver a littl and said
o queen there is troubl the royal ladi amenarta ha told a tale

heavi weight in ani scale she answer
then she went thei all went and left me alon brood there upon the
chair of state in which i sat for the last time the dark close
about me then came the twilight of the rise moon in whose soft rai
i saw the figur of a man creep toward me as a thief creep

i heard and laugh aloud and i think that thi madman interpret
that laugh in a strang fashion at least he threw himself upon me he
seiz my hand and lift it toward hi lip though by those lip it
wa never touch for now rage took hold of me such rage as had
possess my soul in the cave of the fire of life rage and the desir
of destruct that with other evil gift had come to me in the
breath of the fire
accurs on i cri vile and insol thief do you dare to
touch me with your hand awai with you to set let the world know you

as the word pass my lip it seem to me that from some strength
within a wither flame leapt out of me and smote that man as the
lightn smite at the least he lift hi hand to hi head he
reel back he fell he groanedh di
look at him ly there in the moonlight still and bereft of life
at the last i came to know full sure that henceforward i could slai
with a thought that i wa the ladi of death and that such wrath as
other express in word went forth from me with all the might of
heaven moreov that now thi wrath rose suddenli and swiftli in me
easi to unchain hard to hold yea i wa both a furi and a terror
whom no man might cross or vex if he would continu to look upon the
sun
philo came he stare at me and at the dead rame then question me
with hi ey
he would have laid hand on me philo and i slew him i said
then what he ha earn he ha been paid answer philo yet
queen how did you slai him i see no bruis or wound

wretch wa it not that he who hitherto had been a virtuou man a
good and earnest priest who never turn to look at woman of a sudden
went mad for love of you and in hi mad urg hi suitwel as
men do when thei have lost hold of the rein of reason whereon you
slew him now if men must die for such a crime who is there that
would live to grow old i think that all of them would soon be driven
to dwell in such a hermitag as that wherein the holi noot sleep
tonight is it not true i ask you who know the world
it is true i answer
if so ladi i would ask anoth question what wa it that sent thi
man mad wa it not the sight of such beauti as ha never yet been
known upon the earth which beauti ayesha if i look upon it much
longer i think will send me mad also or ani other man daughter of
wisdom such loveli as you wear todai is the greatest curs that
the god can grant to a woman becaus be abov natur all natur
must obei it might daughter of wisdom henceforward you must veil
your face from the ey of men or becom the murderess of more ill
fate on
it seem that thi is so i answer heavili i have desir beauti
and beauti ha come to me but howev great all gift ar not good
so i have heard philosoph preach in greec ladi yet never did i
know on of them to turn hi back on ani gift ayesha hide those ey
of your hide them swiftli while rame li there dead love is
frighten but onc hi clai is gone who know but i forgot i came
to warn you that a certain decre ha been utter against you the
same queen that you have utter against rame also to protect you
if i can
now i laugh outright
foolish man i said do you not yet understand that i cannot be
kill or even harm
ye god said philo hold up hi hand in amaz then he wa
silent
that night i slept by the cold shape of kallikr and oh it wa the
most fear of all night that ever i pass upon the earth evil
veri evil were the dream that came to me if dream thei were in
them it seem that noot spoke with me nai not noot but a
flicker tongu of fire which i knew to be the spirit of noot
naught could i see save that burn tongu and from it came terribl
word
daughter it said you have cast my counsel to the wind you have
betrai your trust you have broken my command that i gave to you
out of the wisdom that wa given to me you have enter the fire that
you were set to watch you have been embrac by the fire and receiv
it gift behold the first fruit of them the man whom you would
have taken li dead at your side and yonder in the templ court
anoth li dead also who wa good until your hellgrant beauti
made him evil the worship of isi is destroi in thi land that now
nevermor will becom a nation great and strong and pure the heart of
amenarta is broken yet she will live on to beget aveng on of
whom will overtak you at the appoint time in loneli in
remors in utter desol you must endur till the fire di that
cannot die while the world is seek yet never find or find
but to lose again henceforth you ar an alien to the kindli race of
men a beauteou terror that all must desir and yet all fear and
hate ever that which you seek will flit befor you like a wander
star which you mai never overtak and in follow it you will bring
death to thousand daughter you ar accurs
is there then no redempt i ask of noot in my dream
ay ayesha when the world is redeem then perchanc you mai find
your part in that great forgiv hearken there is a vision which
throughout your life ha haunt you in that vision aphrodit and the
evil god those god that she had led into egypt to destroi it
higher faith were summon befor the throne of isi in it also a
fate and a command were laid upon youthat you should war against
those god and bring it punish on egypt that receiv and
welcom them
it is but a fantasi i answer now i know that there ar no evil
god there live no aphrodit even no isi
daughter you err true there is no isi who wa shape onli by the
faith of earth and in the dream of men yet there is that which thei
name isi as the highest that thei know and can fashion in their
thought there is the etern good and that good is god throughout
the countless ag man war against natur ha lift up hi
heart till almost he seem to look upon the face of that almighti
regnant good thu it wa with you daughter and now wither have you
wend you have fled down the backward path you have undon all you
have gone back to natur henceforth you ar natur self shine
with her fals and pass beauti inspir with her law of death you
who onc drew near to the new law of life that await you beyond the
grave which now you mai not seek
whateer i did i did for love and love shall save me i seem to
answer in my agoni
ay ayesha doubtless in the end love will save you as it save all
thing that without it grace must perish everlastingli yet for you
that salvat is now far awai and er it can be found on by on
you must conquer those passion that found you in the fire you who
sought undi beauti must see your fair bodi more hideou and more
horribl than the leper of the street you who ar fill with rage
and strength must grow gentl as a dove and weak as a littl child by
suffer you must learn to sooth the suffer of other by
expiat you must aton your crime by faith onc more you must lift
up your soul by the knowledg you shall win you must come to
understand your own blind petti through time untold ayesha thi
is your doom
such wa the substanc of that dream and when i awok from it oh how
bitterli i wept for now i understood i wa fallenfallen all that
i had gather through the long year of prayer and abstin and
servic had been reft from me and i who stood near to joi had sunk
into a hell of unend sorrow there wa no isi so i had dream
noot to sai and so my new knowledg told me yet there wa the
etern good which in egypt men knew as isi and in other land by
mani a differ name and from that good i wa excommun
now like my savag ancestor of a million year befor i wa but a
part of natur as we see her upon the earth and feel her in our blood
andthi wa the most dread of my punishmentsmi wisdom and my
lost faith had becom rule by which i could mete out the measur of
my fall for ignor can smile at that which to knowledg is a hell
all natur gift were mine all her beauti all her desir all her
fierc all her hate and on by on through countless time i
must weed her everi evil growth from the garden of my poison soul
the curs with which she wa accurs had smitten me also and in the
end her death would be my death such wa the doom that i had brought
upon my head when i had listen to the call of that god of fire
oh look upon the cold corps of kallikr and feel the
primev passion surg in my breast littl wonder that i the
reject of heaven wept as still i weep todai
for such is the lot of those who trampl on all good as thei run to
seiz the glitter gaud that the tempter spread befor their
lust ey perchanc noot never broke hi holi rest to speak to me
in dream perchanc it wa the strength in my own soul that spoke to
my heart as that strength of which now i knew the power in the old
dai wrought marvel that then i believ to be done by the invis
hand of isi at least the lesson taught is true
chapter xxv
in undi loneli
er the dawn guid by those old embalm and bear with me the
dead kallikr i depart from that hate kor as i think none
saw me go for forget of their promis vengeanc the priest and
priestess were gather trembl about the corps of rame in the
inmost court of the templ of truth though it is true that i felt the
bale ey of amenarta watch me or perhap it wa her pursu
hate i felt and not her ey
veil so that no man might look upon my deadli beauti i cross the
plain and came to the vast cavesepulchr here those old embalm
lit lamp and show me a deep and empti tomb it had two shelv or
nich on on of which i laid my dead choos the other to be my
couch thu then i took up my abod in the sepulchr of kor that for
some two thousand year were to be my home
at my command philo led the royal amenarta from the haunt land of
kor and return three moon later told me truli or not that she
had pass the swamp and depart on a wander ship sail north
whither he knew not i ask him no more who did not desir to learn
of her word and curs though as it chanc thi i must do after
long ag had gone by some of the priest and priestess went with
her other remain in kor and if thei were young enough took wive
or husband and rule there inde the last of their descend
whom i could trace befor their blood wa utterli swallow up in that
of the barbarian di after five hundr year or more had pass
awai
philo too live on at kor make trade journei to the coast and
along it in hi ship and grew rich and after a fashion great for
philo would never leav me whom he love though no more would he look
upon my unveil face at length veri old he di in my arm he who
would have none of the fire and it gift when hi breath left him
for the first time sinc that night at kor i wept for now i wa
quit alon
while he lai dy he prai me to unveil sai that now when no
harm could come of it he would look upon my face onc more i did so
and he studi me long and earnestli with hi hollow ey
you ar wondrou beauti he said nor dure these past forti
year or more sinc last i beheld you unveil in the sanctuari of
the templ of truth ha your loveli lessen by on wit inde
i think that it ha gather what is the mean of thi fair
daughter of wisdom
it mean what i have told you befor philo that i do not die until
the world di although i mai chang and seem to pass awai
yet i die do we then part for ever he ask
nai i think not philo for at last death overtak everyth and
in it hallwai we mai meet again moreov the world live long and
to it er it end you mai return onc or often and if so
perchanc you will be drawn to me
i trust so o wisdom daughter thei call you witch and doubtless
such you ar who can slai with a glanc whom ag doe not touch and
whom death scorn yet witch or woman or both there live none no
not even wife or child whom i so desir to meet hereaft
so philo di and sinc those medicinemen who had embalm
kallikr now were dead also leav behind them none who had
knowledg of their art i buri him unpreserv in the great
sepulchr
awhil ago the fanci took me to go to look upon him but ala after
the pass of some sixteen hundr year save for the skull hi
nake bone had crumbl into dust
what more is there to tell all di and came again in their children
gener after gener of them did i watch aris flourish in
their wild fashion and go their wai down the path of death i rule
those barbarian if rule it can be call thei were my slave who
fear me as a spirit and i wa kind to them but if thei anger me
then i slew them for thu onli could thei be held in a due subject
even to on that thei believ to be an ancient goddess whom their
forefath worship lulala by name whose throne wa in the moon
for these amahagg were a terribl peopl barbarian who love the
night becaus their deed were evil and who if stranger wander
among them slew them by the set of redhot pot upon their head
and afterward at their flesh yet among them were some of a nobler
sort descend as i think either from the unmix blood of the
ancient of old kor or perchanc from those priest and priestess
of isi who had been my companion such a on wa a certain billali
whom my lord leo and holli knew but for the most part thei were hook
nose treacher darkhaunt savag and as such thei must be
handl
in the cours of those long ag to divert myself in my loneli
and for the purpos of studi i rear certain of these savag up to
thi and that i stunt them to dwarf i bred them to giant
musician of a kind i made of some of them though to do so took ten
of their gener then i grew weari of the game and all these
variant di back into the common stock that fundament type to
which if left alon everi speci that spring on earth return in
time and thi more quickli than might be thought the last breed that
i creat or caus to creat itself wa on of mute evolv from a
faith strain who had serv me well sinc i found these mute more
docil and less wearisom than the rest
but enough of that peopl with which i have done for ever
what did i do through all those aw ag at first as i found i had
the power i threw my watch ey across the world and learn all
that happen there thu i saw the battl of alexand hi
conquest and hi death and the rise of the ptolemi in egypt also
mani other thing in the countri with which i have had to do but
soon i tire of it all
men aros of whom i knew noth peopl chang and ever the plai
repeat itself afresh though with new actor i had naught in common
with them and their petti aim and passion i who watch as a god
might watch those that serv him not or as an idl child watch the
labour of coloni after coloni of ant yea i tire of them and took
no more heed of what thei did or did not do upon their short journei
to that forget wherewith the dust of time would buri them i
wa dead to the world and the world wa dead to me
in the ag that follow i sent out my soul to seek kindr soul and
found some with whom i commun though thei never knew who it wa
that talk to them with wise men throughout the earth i held thi
convers and from them gather knowledg give them in return
someth of my wisdom which doubtless thei present to the
gener as their own if so the world wa the gainer and if
truth come what matter it whenc it come
i did more i sought out the dead in their habit beyond the
star ay and found not a few of them alwai thei were eager to
learn of the world and in return paid me with the coin of their
unearthli lore thei told me of those other world and i made
acquaint with their princ and their ruler i gather up the
broken fragment from the feast that were spread upon these alien
tabl and drank of the dreg of their new wine but and here wa a
mysteri here wa the grief never onc could i grasp the robe of ani
whom i had known upon the earth i found not my father i found not
noot i found not kallikr i found not philo i found not belti
or amenarta in all that countless multitud i discov no singl
soul to whom my mortal lip had spoken in it littl dai of friend or
foe i found not on perchanc all them were still asleep and rest
in their sleep
i look into the secret of natur and thei open themselv to me
like flower beneath the sun i inhal their perfum i admir their
beauti so that at length littl wa hid from me i learn how to
turn clai to gold and how to har the lightn to my servic ay
and mani anoth thing yet what wa the us of all of it to me the
dweller in a tomb
knowledg the lord is a barren grant unless it can also be a
servant ay a slave at command to work good for man
for the rest what could i do without the cave i sow the seed of
tree i watch them spring i watch them grow to sapl and in
the slow progress of the centuri swell to great timber with
farreach arm beneath whose shade i rest thu thei stood for
mani a hundr year then for mani anoth hundr thei decai grew
hollow rot to dust and fell their long dai done at last and i i
sow me other
to mark the passag of those year lest i should lose count of them
in a certain cavern i laid me stone a stone for everi on as from
the hand of time it fell ripe into the bosom of etern as on their
rosari here and there priest set larger bead to mark the tale of
their complet prayer so when ten year had gone i set a larger
stone and when a hundr had pass by on larger yet and white in
colour while the thousandth year i mark with a littl pyramid two
of which now stand in the cave of kor it wa a good plan wherebi i
could reckon easili onli some of the softer stone that lai near to
the mouth of that cavern where sun and rain could reach them at length
crumbl into sand
why did i stai at kor why did i not wander forth through the world
becaus i could not becaus of the curs that had been laid upon
me that here i must wait until kallikr came again as come i knew
he would therefor no captiv ever wa more chain and fetter in
hi dungeon than i ayesha by that compel curs in the sepulchr
of kor where night by night i laid me down to rest in the cold
compani of the dead from time to time onc in a gener mayhap i
would lift the cloth that cover him and look upon hi pale beauti
for those old embalm did not lie and kiss hi brow of ic and
weep and weep then onc more i laid the shroud or a new shroud upon
him and went my weari wai
oh it is terribl in thi world where all is chang where even the
stone grow old and die to reform again to be the on thing that
changeth not for ever yet that wa my lot such wa the gift of the
firelord whom i had wed and embrac there i sat in my etern
beauti which i wa doom to hide lest brute men should be madden
at the sight of it so that i must slai them with the lightn of my
will there i brood gather to my breast all that wisdom of
mother natur of whom now i wa a part all the useless wisdom whose
weight at length clog my sens and cramp my soul there i sat
eaten of desir for on dead and burn with jealou hate of that
woman who had born hi child and who as i knew well wander with
him greater than i perhap and still more fair in some elysium that
even my spirit could not reach take the place that i might fulfil
if onli i could attain to the boon of death which is everlastingli
deni to me until the old world itself shall die there i sai i
sat while the slow fire of the tortur time burn in my breast
at it path through all my be till the hot soul within me turn
to the bitter ash of hopeless
oh why did he not come why did he not come sure the circl must
be complet and the time fulfil sure he must be weari of those
unknown heavenli field and of the coars love of egypt ladi sure
he would come and soon onli then what if here as there she still
companion him
at length on came and when i learn of it my heart flame up with
hope as a torch flame in these dark cave ala it wa not he so
soon as my ey fell on him afar i knew it yonder in the templ of
kor whither i had gone upon the matter of some petti savag troubl
such as had arisen thrice sinc the dai of philo i saw and grew sick
with hope destroi so sick that had he but known it thi littl
wizen wander at that moment stood near to the world edg yet
afterward i came to like him well perchanc becaus he remind me so
much of philo that onc or twice almost i thoughtbut let thi
matter be
he wa a strang man that wander veri shrewd but on who believ
noth which he could not see or touch or handl thu when i told
him tale concern myself and my length of dai and why i sat at kor
in beauti yet like on who is dead in a desert openli he mock at
them which anger me not all of these were true be it admit
becaus be a part of natur as i am how can i alwai speak the
truth
natur show mani face to those who court her natur ha desert
phantasi wherewith the travel is oft deceiv think he see
that which he doe not see though in some shape or form of a sureti
it exist elsewher natur also keep her secret close and ever
instruct in parabl that yet hold the seed of perfect veriti
so be a part of natur self did i with that wander as inde
i do to thi dai with holli the learn who follow after him yet
here the exampl ha it flaw for thi man who wa call watcherin
thenight a name that fit him well enough did not court me as
her watcher court natur the beauti nai he turn hi back upon
me sai he wa not on who love mothlik to sing hi wing in a
flame howev bright i think becaus often he had sing them
alreadi
still i found thi so strang that almost i began to wonder whether
onc more my beauti wa on the wane and whether it need longer to be
hidden beneath a veil or whether perchanc men had grown wiser than
thei us to be therefor onc for a littl moment i put out my
strength and brought him to hi knee and have taught him certain
lesson i laugh at him and let him go yet be it said that i held
and hold him dear and look onward to the dai when we shall meet
again as perchanc we have met in those that ar long past so enough
of thi brave and honest man gentli born also and instruct in hi
fashion doubtless he di mani year ago
i tire of thi long sad task let the end of my tale be short
at last at last came kallikr reborn lack memori chang
in spirit and yet in face and form the veri same holli brought him
hither or he brought holli becaus of an ancient ly screed that
amenarta wrote upon a sherd which from ag to ag had pass down in
hi race urg some descend of her blood to find me out and slai
me for thi egyptian fool thought that i could be slain
he came and by heaven i knew not that he wa here until the crab
holli led me to the couch whereon he lai feverstricken and at the
veri point of death by my art i drag him back from between those
door of doom that almost onc again had close behind him and
afterward reveal to him my beauti and my burn love caus him
to worship me yet mark he came not alon as i fear would chanc
someth of amenarta prison in a savag woman breast came with
him and alreadi he wa her lover
i slew that woman who wa obstin and would not leav him though
the deed griev me i slew her becaus i must it matter littl
for soon she wa forgot and i held him fast
of the rest littl need be said for holli know it all and tell me
that he ha written it in a book becaus i might not wed with mortal
man i led kallikr he who now wa known as leo down the peril
wai to that hid cavern where ever the bright spirit of life clad in
flame and thunder march on hi endless round behold as it had
been over two thousand year befor so it wa now again kallikr
fear to enter the flame and put on majesti to becom undi
king of all the world ay even though the prize of my glori lai to
hi hand hi flesh shrank from the fire
therefor that he might learn courag onc more i gave myself to the
embrac of the god and lo thi time he slew me ye in utter shame
and hideous befor my lover ey there i di or rather seem
to die an ancient shrivel apelik thing yet dy my
unconqu spirit gave me strength to mutter in hi ear that i should
come again and onc more be beauti
nai i did not die far awai again i becam incarn in thi distant
asian land which after all is my own sinc in a part of it first i
saw the light here in thi cavernmonasteri where still linger some
shadow of the worship of the moon and of the great principl that in
the old dai wa name isi queen of heaven onc more i wa cloth
with mortal flesh
the year went by but two or three of them and i found the power to
search out kallikr or leo vincei still live on the earth and
in a vision show him the mountain that i inhabit he wa faith
ye like holli he wa faith and togeth thei follow that
vision for twice ten year thei search and then at last thei found
me thei pass the peril and the test kallikr or leo vincei
escap the web spun by the queen aten she in whom amenarta onc
more show herself upon the earth thei endur the appoint trial
ay when i unveil befor him on the mountain peak my love my
etern love my doom and my desir found strength and faith to kiss
my hideou wither brow then wa that faith reward then befor
hi veri ey i chang into the flower of all beauti into the glori
of all power and he worship worship worship
now soon we shall be wed now soon the curs shall fall from us like
