prefac
the writer of thi romanc ha been encourag to hi task by a purpos
somewhat beyond that of set out a wild tale of savag life when he
wa yet a ladnow some seventeen year agofortun took him to south
africa there he wa thrown in with men who for thirti or forti year
had been intim acquaint with the zulu peopl with their histori
their hero and their custom from these he heard mani tale and
tradit some of which perhap ar rare told nowadai and in
time to come mai ceas to be told altogeth then the zulu were still
a nation now that nation ha been destroi and the chief aim of
it white ruler is to root out the warlik spirit for which it wa
remark and to replac it by a spirit of peac progress the zulu
militari organis perhap the most wonder that the world ha
seen is alreadi a thing of the past it perish at ulundi it wa
chaka who invent that organis build it up from the smallest
begin when he appear at the commenc of thi centuri it wa
as the ruler of a singl small tribe when he fell in the year 1828
beneath the assegai of hi brother umhlangana and dingaan and of hi
servant mopo or umbopo as he is call also all southeastern africa
wa at hi feet and in hi march to power he had slaughter more than
a million human be an attempt ha been made in these page to set
out the true charact of thi coloss geniu and most evil mana
napoleon and a tiberiiu in oneand also that of hi brother and
successor dingaan so no more need be said of them here the author
aim moreov ha been to convei in a narr form some idea of the
remark spirit which anim these king and their subject and to
make access in a popular shape incid of histori which ar now
for the most part onli to be found in a few scarc work of refer
rare consult except by student it will be obviou that such a
task ha present difficulti sinc he who undertak it must for a
time forget hi civilis and think with the mind and speak with the
voic of a zulu of the old regim all the horror perpetr by the
zulu tyrant cannot be publish in thi polit ag of melanit and
torpedo their detail have therefor been suppress still much
remain and those who think it wrong that massacr and fight
should be written ofexcept by special correspondentsor that the
suffer of mankind beneath on of the world most cruel tyranni
should form the groundwork of romanc mai be invit to leav thi
book unread most inde nearli all of the histor incid
here record ar substanti true thu it is said that chaka did
actual kill hi mother unandi for the reason given and destroi an
entir tribe in the tatiyana cleft and that he prophesi of the come
of the white man after receiv hi death wound of the incid of
the missionari and the furnac of log it is imposs to speak so
certainli it came to the writer from the lip of an old travel in
the zulu but he cannot discov ani confirm of it still these
king undoubtedli put their soldier to mani test of equal sever
umbopo or mopo as he is name in thi tale actual live after he
had stab chaka he rose to great emin then he disappear from
the scene but it is not accur known whether he also went the wai
of the assegai or perhap as is here suggest came to live near
stanger under the name of zweet the fate of the two lover at the
mouth of the cave is a true zulu tale which ha been consider
vari to suit the purpos of thi romanc the late mr lesli who
di in 1874 tell it in hi book among the zulu and amatonga i
heard a stori the other dai he sai which if the power of write
fiction were possess by me i might have work up into a firstclass
sensat novel it is the stori that ha been woven into the plot of
thi book to him also the writer is indebt for the artific by which
umslopogaa obtain admiss to the swazi stronghold it wa told to
mr lesli by the zulu who perform the feat and therebi won a wife
also the writer thank ar due to hi friend mr f b fynnei 1
late zulu border agent for much inform given to him in bygon
year by word of mouth and more recent through hi pamphlet zululand
and the zulu and to mr john bird formerli treasur to the
govern of natal whose compil the annal of natal is
invalu to all who would studi the earli histori of that coloni and
of zululand
as for the wilder and more romant incid of thi stori such as the
hunt of umslopogaa and galazi with the wolv or rather with the
hyaenasfor there ar no true wolv in zululandth author can onli
sai that thei seem to him of a sort that might well have been mythic
connect with the name of those hero similar belief and tradit
ar common in the record of primit peopl the club watcher of the
ford or to give it zulu name unothlolamazibuko is an histor
weapon chronicl by bishop callawai it wa onc own by a certain
undhlebekazizwa he wa an arbitrari person for no matter what wa
discuss in our villag he would bring it to a conclus with a
stick but he made a good end for when the zulu soldier attack him
he kill no less than twenti of them with the watcher and the spear
stuck in him as thick as reed in a morass thi man strength wa
so great that he could kill a leopard like a fly with hi hand onli
much as umslopogaa slew the traitor in thi stori
perhap it mai be allow to add a few word about the zulu mystic
magic and superstit to which there is some allus in thi
romanc it ha been littl if at all exagger thu the writer well
rememb hear a legend how the guardian spirit of the amazulu wa
seen ride down the storm here is what mr fynnei sai of her in the
pamphlet to which refer ha been made the nativ have a spirit
which thei call nomkubulwana or the inkosazanayezulu the princess
of heaven she is said to be robe in white and to take the form of
a young maiden in fact an angel she is said to appear to some
chosen person to whom she impart some revel but whatev
that revel mai be it is kept a profound secret from outsid
i rememb that just befor the zulu war nomkubulwana appear
reveal someth or other which had a great effect throughout the
land and i know that the zulu were quit impress that some calam
wa about to befal them on of the omin sign wa that fire is said
to have descend from heaven and ignit the grass over the grave
of the former king of zululand on anoth occas nomkubulwana
appear to some on in zululand the result of that visit be that
the nativ women buri their young children up to their head in sand
desert them for the time be go awai weep but return at
nightfal to unearth the littl on again
for thi divin personag there is therefor author and the same
mai be said of most of the supernatur matter spoken of in these
page the exact spiritu posit held in the zulu mind by the
umkulunkuluth oldoldth greatgreatth lord of heavensi
a more vex question and for it proper consider the reader must
be refer to bishop callawai work the religi system of the
amazulu briefli umkulunkulu charact seem to vari from the idea
of an ancestr spirit or the spirit of an ancestor to that of a god
in the case of an abl and highli intellig person like the mopo of
thi stori the ideal would probabl not be a low on therefor he is
made to speak of umkulunkulu as the great spirit or god
it onli remain to the writer to express hi regret that thi stori is
not more vari in it hue it would have been desir to introduc
some gayer and more happi incid but it ha not been possibl it is
believ that the pictur given of the time is a faith on though
it mai be open to correct in some of it detail at the least the
ag man who tell the tale of hi wrong and vengeanc could not be
expect to treat hi subject in an optimist or even in a cheer
vein

some year sinceit wa dure the winter befor the zulu wara white
man wa travel through natal hi name doe not matter for he plai
no part in thi stori with him were two wagon laden with good which
he wa transport to pretoria the weather wa cold and there wa
littl or no grass for the oxen which made the journei difficult but
he had been tempt to it by the high rate of transport that prevail
at that season of the year which would remuner him for ani probabl
loss he might suffer in cattl so he push along on hi journei and
all went well until he had pass the littl town of stanger onc the
site of duguza the kraal of chaka the first zulu king and the uncl of
cetywayo the night after he left stanger the air turn bitterli cold
heavi grei cloud fill the sky and hid the light of the star
now if i were not in natal i should sai that there wa a heavi fall of
snow come said the white man to himself i have often seen the sky
look like that in scotland befor snow then he reflect that there
had been no deep snow in natal for year and have drunk a tot of
squarefac and smoke hi pipe he went to bed beneath the aftert of
hi larger wagon
dure the night he wa awaken by a sens of bitter cold and the low
moan of the oxen that were ti to the trektow everi ox in it
place he thrust hi head through the curtain of the tent and look
out the earth wa white with snow and the air wa full of it swept
along by a cut wind
now he sprang up huddl on hi cloth and as he did so call to
the kaffir who slept beneath the wagon present thei awok from
the stupor which alreadi wa begin to overcom them and crept out
shiver with cold and wrap from head to foot in blanket
quick you boi he said to them in zulu quick would you see the
cattl die of the snow and wind loos the oxen from the trektow and
drive them in between the wagon thei will give them some shelter and
light a lantern he sprang out into the snow
at last it wa doneno easi task for the numb hand of the kaffir
could scarc loosen the frozen reim the wagon were outspan
side by side with a space between them and into thi space the mob of
thirtysix oxen wa driven and there secur by reim ti crosswis
from the front and hind wheel of the wagon then the white man crept
back to hi bed and the shiver nativ fortifi with gin or
squarefac as it is call local took refug on the second wagon
draw a tentsail over them
for awhil there wa silenc save for the moan of the huddl and
restless cattl
if the snow goe on i shall lose my oxen he said to himself thei
can never bear thi cold
hardli had the word pass hi lip when the wagon shook there wa a
sound of break reim and trampl hoof onc more he look out
the oxen had skreck in a mob there thei were run awai into the
night and the snow seek to find shelter from the cold in a minut
thei had vanish utterli there wa noth to be done except wait for
the morn
at last it came reveal a landscap blind with snow such search as
could be made told them noth the oxen had gone and their spoor wa
obliter by the freshfallen flake the white man call a council
of hi kaffir servant what wa to be done he ask
on said thi thing on that but all agre that thei must wait to act
until the snow melt
or till we freez you whose mother were fool said the white
man who wa in the worst of temper for had he not lost four hundr
pound worth of oxen
then a zulu spoke who hitherto had remain silent he wa the driver
of the first wagon
my father he said to the white man thi is my word the oxen ar
lost in the snow no man know whither thei have gone or whether thei
live or ar now but hide and bone yet at the kraal yonder and he
point to some hut about two mile awai on the hillsid live a
witch doctor name zweet he is oldveri oldbut he ha wisdom and
he can tell you where the oxen ar if ani man mai my father
stuff answer the white man still as the kraal cannot be colder
than thi wagon we will go and ask zweet bring a bottl of squarefac
and some snuff with you for present
an hour later he stood in the hut of zweet befor him wa a veri
ancient man a mere bag of bone with sightless ey and on handhi
leftwhit and shrivel
what do you seek of zweet my white father ask the old man in a
thin voic you do not believ in me and my wisdom why should i help
you yet i will do it though it is against your law and you do wrong
to ask mey to show you that there is truth in us zulu doctor i
will help you my father i know what you seek you seek to know where
your oxen have run for shelter from the cold is it not so
it is so doctor answer the white man you have long ear
ye my white father i have long ear though thei sai that i grow
deaf i have keen ey also and yet i cannot see your face let me
hearken let me look
for awhil he wa silent rock himself to and fro then he spoke

littl red zulu ox with on horn and the speckl ox you shall not
find these for thei have di in the snow send and you will find
the other no no i ask no fee i do not work wonder for reward why
should i i am rich
now the white man scof but in the end so great is the power of
superstit he sent and here it mai be state that on the eleventh
dai of hi sojourn at the kraal of zweet those whom he sent return
with the oxen except the three onli after that he scof no more
those eleven dai he spent in a hut of the old man kraal and everi
afternoon he came and talk with him sit far into the night
on the third dai he ask zweet how it wa that hi left hand wa white
and shrivel and who were umslopogaa and nada of whom he had let
fall some word then the old man told him the tale that is set out
here dai by dai he told some of it till it wa finish it is not all
written in these page for portion mai have been forgotten or put
asid as irrelev neither ha it been possibl for the writer of it
to render the full forc of the zulu idiom nor to convei a pictur of
the teller for in truth he act rather than told hi stori wa the
death of a warrior in question he stab with hi stick show how
the blow fell and where did the stori grow sorrow he groan or
even wept moreov he had mani voic on for each of the actor in
hi tale thi man ancient and wither seem to live again in the
far past it wa the past that spoke to hi listen tell of deed
long forgotten of deed that ar no more known

stori of zweet in the spirit in which zweet told it and becaus the
histori of nada the lili and of those with whom her life wa intertwin

ox the zulu ar not what thei were to stand against them ye ye
thei will come true and mine is the song of a peopl that is doom
but of these other word i will speak in their place
i went to my mother present she rais herself from the ground and
sat up with her hand over her face the blood from the wound the stick
had made ran down her face on to her breast and i wipe it awai with
grass she sat for a long while thu while the child cri the cow
low to be milk and i wipe up the blood with the grass at last she
took her hand awai and spoke to me
mopo my son she said i have dream a dream i dream that i
saw the boi chaka who struck me he wa grown like a giant he stalk
across the mountain and the veldt hi ey blaze like the lightn
and in hi hand he shook a littl assegai that wa red with blood he
caught up peopl after peopl in hi hand and tore them he stamp
their kraal flat with hi feet befor him wa the green of summer
behind him the land wa black as when the fire have eaten the grass i
saw our peopl mopo thei were mani and fat their heart laugh the
men were brave the girl were fair i count their children by
the hundr i saw them again mopo thei were bone white bone
thousand of bone tumbl togeth in a rocki place and he chaka
stood over the bone and laugh till the earth shook then mopo in
my dream i saw you grown a man you alon were left of our peopl you
crept up behind the giant chaka and with you came other great men of
a royal look you stab him with a littl spear and he fell down and
grew small again he fell down and curs you but you cri in hi ear
a nameth name of baleka your sisterand he di let us go home
mopo let us go home the dark fall
so we rose and went home but i held my peac for i wa afraid veri
much afraid
chapter ii mopo is in troubl
now i must tell how my mother did what the boi chaka had told her and
di quickli for where hi stick had struck her on the forehead there
came a sore that would not be heal and in the sore grew an abscess
and the abscess at inward till it came to the brain then my mother
fell down and di and i cri veri much for i love her and it
wa dread to see her cold and stiff with not a word to sai howev
loudli i call to her well thei buri my mother and she wa soon
forgotten i onli rememb her nobodi els didnot even baleka for
she wa too littleand as for my father he took anoth young wife and
wa content after that i wa unhappi for my brother did not love me
becaus i wa much clever than thei and had greater skill with the
assegai and wa swifter in run so thei poison the mind of my
father against me and he treat me badli but baleka and i love each
other for we were both lone and she clung to me like a creeper to
the onli tree in a plain and though i wa young i learn thi that
to be wise is to be strong for though he who hold the assegai kill
yet he whose mind direct the battl is greater than he who kill now i
saw that the witchfind and the medicinemen were fear in the land
and that everybodi look up to them so that even when thei had onli
a stick in their hand ten men arm with spear would fly befor them
therefor i determin that i should be a witchdoctor for thei alon
can kill those whom thei hate with a word so i learn the art of the
medicinemen i made sacrific i fast in the veldt alon i did all
those thing of which you have heard and i learn much for there is
wisdom in our magic as well as liesand you know it my father els
you had not come here to ask me about your lost oxen

it chanc a rich man of a neighbour tribe had lost some cattl and
came with gift to noma prai him to smell them out noma tri and
could not find them hi vision fail him then the headman grew angri
and demand back hi gift but noma would not give up that which he
onc had held and hot word pass the headman said that he would kill
noma noma said that he would bewitch the headman
peac i said for i fear that blood would be shed peac and let
me see if my snake will tell me where the cattl ar

then i made hast to begin i threw the bone the headman sat on the
ground befor me and answer my question you know of these matter
my fatherhow sometim the witchdoctor ha knowledg of where the
lost thing ar for our ear ar long and sometim hi ehlos tell

my snake stood up i knew noth of the man cattl but my spirit wa
with me and soon i saw them all and told them to him on by on their
colour their ageeveryth i told him too where thei were and how
on of them had fallen into a stream and lai there on it back drown
with it forefoot caught in a fork root as my ehlos told me so i
told the headman
now the man wa pleas and said that if my sight wa good and he
found the cattl the gift should be taken from noma and given to me
and he ask the peopl who were sit round and there were mani if
thi wa not just ye ye thei said it wa just and thei would
see that it wa done but noma sat still and look at me evilli he
knew that i had made a true divin and he wa veri angri it wa a
big matter the herd of cattl were mani and if thei were found where
i had said then all men would think me the greater wizard now it wa
late and the moon had not yet risen therefor the headman said that
he would sleep that night in our kraal and at the first light would
go with me to the spot where i said the cattl were after that he went
awai
i too went into my hut and lai down to sleep suddenli i awok feel
a weight upon my breast i tri to start up but someth cold prick

drive them straight to the kraal and denounc noma befor the chief my
father and all the peopl but i wa young in those dai and did not

for noth oh he wa evilh wa cun as a jackal and fierc
like a lion he had plant me by him like a tree but he meant to
keep me clip like a bush now i had grown tall and overshadow him
therefor he would root me up
i went to the corner of my hut noma watch me all the while and took
a kerri and my small shield then i start through the moonlight till
i wa past the kraal i glide along quietli as a shadow after that i
began to run sing to myself as i went to frighten awai the ghost
my father
for an hour i travel swiftli over the plain till i came to the
hillsid where the bush began here it wa veri dark under the shade
of the tree and i sang louder than ever at last i found the littl
buffalo path i sought and turn along it present i came to an open
place where the moonlight crept in between the tree i knelt down and
look ye my snake had not li to me there wa the spoor of the
cattl then i went on gladli till i reach a dell through which the
water ran softli sometim whisper and sometim talk out loud
here the trail of the cattl wa broad thei had broken down the fern
with their feet and trampl the grass present i came to a pool i
knew itit wa the pool my snake had shown me and there at the edg of
the pool float the drown ox it foot caught in a fork root all
wa just as i had seen it in my heart
i step forward and look round my ey caught someth it wa the
faint grei light of the dawn glint on the cattl horn as i look
on of them snort rose and shook the dew from hi hide he seem big
as an eleph in the mist and twilight
then i collect them allther were seventeenand drove them befor
me down the narrow path back toward the kraal now the daylight came
quickli and the sun had been up an hour when i reach the spot where
i must turn if i wish to hide the cattl in the secret place as noma
had bid me but i would not do thi no i would go on to the kraal
with them and tell all men that noma wa a thief still i sat down and
rest awhil for i wa tire as i sat i heard a nois and look
up there over the slope of the rise came a crowd of men and lead

sound of their chase grew fainter and fainter till at last i wa out of

chapter iii mopo ventur home
i threw myself down on the grass and pant till my breath came back
then i went and hid in a patch of reed down by a swamp all dai long i
lai there think what wa i to do now i wa a jackal without a hole
if i went back to my peopl certainli thei would kill me whom thei
thought a thief my blood would be given for noma and that i did not
wish though my heart wa sad then there came into my mind the thought
of chaka the boi to whom i had given the cup of water long ago i had
heard of him hi name wa known in the land alreadi the air wa big
with it the veri tree and grass spoke it the word he had said and
the vision that my mother had seen were begin to come true by the
help of the umtetwa he had taken the place of hi father senzangacona
he had driven out the tribe of the amaquab now he made war on zweet
chief of the endwand and he had sworn that he would stamp the endwand
flat so that nobodi could find them ani more now i rememb how thi
chaka promis that he would make me great and that i should grow fat
in hi shadow and i thought to myself that i would aris and go to him
perhap he would kill me well what did it matter certainli i should
be kill if i stai here ye i would go but now my heart pull
anoth wai there wa but on whom i love in the worldit wa
my sister baleka my father had betroth her to the chief of a
neighbour tribe but i knew that thi marriag wa against her wish
perhap my sister would run awai with me if i could get near her to tell
her that i wa go i would tryy i would try
i wait till the dark came down then i rose from my bed of weed
and crept like a jackal toward the kraal in the meali garden i
stop awhil for i wa veri hungri and fill myself with the
halfrip meali then i went on till i came to the kraal some of my
peopl were seat outsid of a hut talk togeth over a fire i
crept near silent as a snake and hid behind a littl bush i knew
that thei could not see me outsid the ring of the firelight and i
want to hear what thei said as i guess thei were talk of me
and call me mani name thei said that i should bring illluck on the
tribe by have kill so great a witchdoctor as noma also that the
peopl of the headman would demand payment for the assault on him i
learn moreov that my father had order out all the men of the
tribe to hunt for me on the morrow and to kill me wherev thei found
me ah i thought you mai hunt but you will bring noth home to
the pot just then a dog that wa ly by the fire got up and began to
sniff the air i could not see what dog it wasinde i had forgotten
all about the dog when i drew near the kraal that is what come of
want of experi my father the dog snif and snif then he
began to growl look alwai my wai and i grew afraid
what is the dog growl at said on man to anoth go and see
but the other man wa take snuff and did not like to move let the
dog go and see for himself he answer sneez what is the good of
keep a dog if you have to catch the thief
go on then said the first man to the dog and he ran forward
bark then i saw him it wa my own dog koo a veri good dog
present as i lai not know what to do he smelt my smell stop
bark and run round the bush he found me and began to lick my
face be quiet koo i whisper to him and he lai down by my side
where ha that dog gone now said the first man is he bewitch
that he stop bark suddenli and doe not come back
we will see said the other rise a spear in hi hand
now onc more i wa terribl afraid for i thought that thei would catch
me or i must run for my life again but as i sprang up to run a big
black snake glide between the men and went off toward the hut thei
jump asid in a great fright then all of them turn to follow the
snake sai that thi wa what the dog wa bark at that wa my
good ehlos my father which without ani doubt took the shape of a
snake to save my life
when thei had gone i crept off the other wai and koo follow me at
first i thought that i would kill him lest he should betrai me but
when i call to him to knock him on the head with my kerri he sat
down upon the ground wag hi tail and seem to smile in my face
and i could not do it so i thought that i would take my chanc and we
went on togeth thi wa my purpos first to creep into my own hut
and get my assegai and a skin blanket then to gain speech with baleka
my hut i thought would be empti for nobodi sleep there except
myself and the hut of noma were some pace awai to the right i came
to the reed fenc that surround the hut nobodi wa to be seen at the
gate which wa not shut with thorn as usual it wa my duti to close
it and i had not been there to do so then bid the dog lie down
outsid i step through boldli reach the door of my hut and
listen it wa empti there wa not even a breath to be heard so i
crept in and began to search for my assegai my watergourd and my
wood pillow which wa so nice carv that i did not like to leav it
soon i found them then i felt about for my skin rug and as i did so my
hand touch someth cold i start and felt again it wa a man
faceth face of a dead man of noma whom i had kill and who had
been laid in my hut to await burial oh then i wa frighten for noma
dead and in the dark wa wors than noma aliv i made readi to fly
when suddenli i heard the voic of women talk outsid the door of
the hut i knew the voic thei were those of noma two wive and on
of them said she wa come in to watch by her husband bodi now i wa
in a trap inde for befor i could do anyth i saw the light go out
of a hole in the hut and knew by the sound of a fat woman puf
as she bent herself up that noma first wife wa come through it
present she wa in and squat by the side of the corps in such a
fashion that i could not get to the door she began to make lament
and to call down curs on me ah she did not know that i wa
listen i too squat by noma head and grew quickwit in my
fear now that the woman wa there i wa not so much afraid of the dead
man and i rememb too that he had been a great cheat so i thought
i would make him cheat for the last time i place my hand beneath hi
shoulder and push him up so that he sat upon the ground the woman
heard the nois and made a sound in her throat
will you not be quiet you old hag i said in noma voic can you
not let me be at peac even now when i am dead
she heard and fall backward in fear drew in her breath to shriek
aloud
what will you also dare to shriek i said again in noma voic
then i must teach you silenc and i tumbl him over on to the top of
her
then her sens left her and whether she ever found them again i do not
know at least she grew quiet for that time for me i snatch up the
rugafterward i found it wa noma best kaross made by basuto of
chosen catskin and worth three oxenand i fled follow by koo
now the kraal of the chief my father makedama wa two hundr pace
awai and i must go thither for there baleka slept also i dare not
enter by the gate becaus a man wa alwai on guard there so i cut my
wai through the reed fenc with my assegai and crept to the hut where
baleka wa with some of her halfsist i knew on which side of the
hut it wa her custom to lie and where her head would be so i lai down
on my side and gentli veri gentli began to bore a hole in the grass
cover of the hut it took a long while for the thatch wa thick
but at last i wa nearli through it then i stop for it came into my
mind that baleka might have chang her place and that i might wake the
wrong girl i almost gave it over think that i would fly alon when
suddenli i heard a girl wake and begin to cry on the other side of the
thatch ah i thought that is baleka who weep for her brother so
i put my lip where the thatch wa thinnest and whisper
baleka my sister baleka do not weep i mopo am here sai not a
word but rise come out of the hut bring your skin blanket
now baleka wa veri clever she did not shriek as most girl would have
done no she understood and after wait awhil she rose and crept
from the hut her blanket in her hand
why ar you here mopo she whisper as we met sure you will be
kill
hush i said and then i told her of the plan which i had made will
you come with me i said when i had done or will you creep back into
the hut and bid me farewel
she thought awhil then she said no my brother i will come for i
love you alon among our peopl though i believ that thi will be the
end of itthat you will lead me to my death
i did not think much of her word at the time but afterward thei came
back to me so we slip awai togeth follow by the dog koo
and soon we were run over the veldt with our face set toward the
countri of the zulu tribe
chapter iv the flight of mopo and baleka
all the rest of that night we journei till even the dog wa tire
then we hid in a meali field for the dai as we were afraid of be
seen toward the afternoon we heard voic and look through the
stem of the meali we saw a parti of my father men pass search
for us thei went on to a neighbour kraal to ask if we had been seen
and after that we saw them no more for awhil at night we travel
again but as fate would have it we were met by an old woman who
look oddli at us but said noth after that we push on dai and
night for we knew that the old woman would tell the pursuer if she met
them and so inde it came about on the third even we reach some
meali garden and saw that thei had been trampl down among the
broken meali we found the bodi of a veri old man as full of assegai
wound as a porcupin with quill we wonder at thi and went on a
littl wai then we saw that the kraal to which the garden belong
wa burnt down we crept up to it andah it wa a sad sight for us
to see afterward we becam us to such sight all about us lai
the bodi of dead peopl score of themold men young men women
children littl babi at the breastther thei lai among the burnt
hut pierc with assegai wound red wa the earth with their blood
and red thei look in the red light of the set sun it wa as
though all the land had been smear with the bloodi hand of the great
spirit of the umkulunkulu baleka saw it and began to cry she wa
weari poor girl and we had found littl to eat onli grass and green
corn
an enemi ha been here i said and as i spoke i thought that i heard
a groan from the other side of a broken reed hedg i went and look
there lai a young woman she wa badli wound but still aliv my
father a littl wai from her lai a man dead and befor him sever
other men of anoth tribe he had di fight in front of the woman
were the bodi of three children anoth a littl on lai on her
bodi i look at the woman and as i look she groan again open
her ey and saw me and that i had a spear in my hand
kill me quickli she said have you not tortur me enough
i said that i wa a stranger and did not want to kill her
then bring me water she said there is a spring there behind the
kraal
i call to baleka to come to the woman and went with my gourd to the
spring there were bodi in it but i drag them out and when the
water had clear a littl i fill the gourd and brought it back to the
woman she drank deep and her strength came back a littleth water
gave her life
how did you come to thi i ask
it wa an impi of chaka chief of the zulu that at us up she
answer thei burst upon as at dawn thi morn while we were asleep
in our hut ye i woke up to hear the sound of kill i wa sleep
by my husband with him who li there and the children we all ran
out my husband had a spear and shield he wa a brave man see he di
brave he kill three of the zulu devil befor he himself wa dead
then thei caught me and kill my children and stab me till thei
thought that i wa dead afterward thei went awai i dont know why
thei came but i think it wa becaus our chief would not send men to
help chaka against zweet
she stop gave a great cry and di
my sister wept at the sight and i too wa stir by it ah i
thought to myself the great spirit must be evil if he is not evil
such thing would not happen that is how i thought then my father
now i think differ i know that we had not found out the path of
the great spirit that is all i wa a chicken in those dai my father
afterward i got us to such sight thei did not stir me ani more not
on whit but then in the dai of chaka the river ran bloody we
had to look at the water to see if it wa clean befor we drank peopl
learn how to die then and not make a nois about it what doe it
matter thei would have been dead now anywai it doe not matter
noth matter except be born that is a mistak my father
we stop at the kraal that night but we could not sleep for we heard
the itongo the ghost of the dead peopl move about and call to
each other it wa natur that thei should do so men were look for
their wive and mother for their children but we were afraid that
thei might be angri with us for be there so we clung togeth and
trembl in each other arm koo also trembl and from time to time
he howl loudli but thei did not seem to see us and toward morn
their cri grew fainter
when the first light came we rose and pick our wai through the dead
down to the plain now we had an easi road to follow to chaka kraal
for there wa the spoor of the impi and of the cattl which thei had
stolen and sometim we came to the bodi of a warrior who had been
kill becaus hi wound prevent him from march farther but now
i wa doubt whether it wa wise for us to go to chaka for after what
we had seen i grew afraid lest he should kill us still we had nowher
to turn so i said that we would walk along till someth happen
now we grew faint with hunger and weari and baleka said that we had
better sit down and die for then there would be no more troubl so we
sat down by a spring but i did not wish to die yet thought baleka wa
right and it would have been well to do so as we sat the dog koo
went to a bush that wa near and present i heard him spring at
someth and the sound of struggl i ran to the bushh had caught
hold of a duiker buck as big as himself that wa asleep in it then
i drove my spear into the buck and shout for joi for here wa food
when the buck wa dead i skin him and we took bit of the flesh
wash them in the water and at them for we had no fire to cook them
with it is not nice to eat uncook flesh but we were so hungri that
we did not mind and the good refresh us when we had eaten what we
could we rose and wash ourselv at the spring but as we wash
baleka look up and gave a cry of fear for there on the crest of the
hill about ten spearthrow awai wa a parti of six arm men peopl
of my own tribechildren of my father makedamawho still pursu us to
take us or kill us thei saw usthei rais a shout and began to run
we too sprang up and ranran like buck for fear had touch our feet
now the land lai thu befor us the ground wa open and slope down to
the bank of the white umfolozi which twist through the plain like a
great and shine snake on the other side the ground rose again and we
did not know what wa beyond but we thought that in thi direct lai
the kraal of chaka we ran for the riverwher els were we to run
and after us came the warrior thei gain on us thei were strong
and thei were angri becaus thei had come so far run as we would still
thei gain now we near the bank of the river it wa full and wide
abov us the water ran angrili break into swirl of white where
thei pass over sunken rock below wa a rapid in which none might
live between the two a deep pool where the water wa quiet but the
stream strong
ah my brother what shall we do gasp baleka
there is thi to choos i answer perish on the spear of our
peopl or try the river
easier to die by water than on iron she answer
good i said now mai our snake look toward us and the spirit of
our father be with us at the least we can swim and i led her to
the head of the pool we threw awai our blanketseveryth except an
assegai which i held in my teethand we plung in wade as far as
we could now we were up to our breast now we had lost the earth and
were swim toward the middl of the river the dog koo lead the
wai
then it wa that the soldier appear upon the bank ah littl
peopl on cri you swim do you well you will drown and if you
do not drown we know a ford and we will catch you and kill youy if
we must run over the edg of the world after you we will catch you
and he hurl an assegai after us which fell between us like a flash of
light
while he spoke we swam hard and now we were in the current it swept
us downward but still we made wai for we could swim well it wa just
thi if we could reach the bank befor we were swept into the rapid
we were safe if not thengoodnight now we were near the other side
but ala we were also near the lip of the foam water we strain
we struggl baleka wa a brave girl and she swam brave but the
water push her down below me and i could do noth to help her i
got my foot upon the rock and look round there she wa and eight
pace from her the broken water boil i could not go back i wa too
weak and it seem that she must perish but the dog koo saw he swam
toward her bark then turn round head for the shore she
grasp him by the tail with her right hand then he put out hi
strengthh wa veri strong she took struck out with her feet and
left hand and slowlyveri slowlydrew near then i stretch out
the handl of my assegai toward her she caught it with her left hand
alreadi her feet were over the brink of the rapid but i pull and
koo pull and we brought her safe into the shadow and from the
shallow to the bank and there she fell gasp
now when the soldier on the other bank saw that we had cross thei
shout threat at us then ran awai down the bank
aris baleka i said thei have gone to see a ford
ah let me die she answer
but i forc her to rise and after awhil she got her breath again
and we walk on as fast as we could up the long rise for two hour
we walk or more till at last we came to the crest of the rise and

blind with weari and terror and not see my purpos stagger

heart beat and the blood drum in my ear but when thei drew near and
i roseth assegai in my handonc more the red cloth seem to go up

him through the back it wa all done in the shake of a leaf my father
in the shake of a leaf he also wa dead then i ran for i had no
stomach for the other two my valour wa gone
about a hundr pace from me baleka wa stagger along with her arm

left her altogeth ye there she fell senseless and i stood by her
and there too i should have been kill had not thi chanc sinc
the other two men have stai on instant by their dead fellow came
on against me mad with rage for at that moment the gate of the kraal
open and through it ran a parti of soldier drag a prison by
the arm after them walk a great man who wore a leopard skin on
hi shoulder and wa laugh and with him were five or six ring
councillor and after them again came a compani of warrior
the soldier saw that kill wa go on and ran up just as the

just then the tall chief saw blood and heard word he stalk up and
he wa a great man to look at though still quit young in year for
he wa taller by a head than ani round him and hi chest wa big as the
chest of two hi face wa fierc and beauti and when he grew angri

while the soldier murmur ou he is wise he is great hi justic

round
veri well mopo and thy sister baleka said chaka grimli

sister now tell me thy tale speak onli the truth
so i sat down and told him all nor did he grow weari of listen but
when i had done he said but on thingthat he would that the dog koo
had not been kill sinc if he had still been aliv he would have
set him on the hut of my father makedama and made him chief over the
langeni
then he spoke to the captain of the soldier i take back my word he
said let not these men of the langeni be mutil on shall die and
the other shall go free here and he point to the man whom we had
seen led out of the kraalgat here mopo we have a man who ha
prove himself a coward yesterdai a kraal of wizard yonder wa eaten

dog wa afraid to meet him face to face he kill him with a throw
assegai and afterward he stab the woman that is noth but he
should have fought the husband hand to hand now i will do him honour
he shall fight to the death with on of these pig from thy sty and he
point with hi spear to the men of my father kraal and the on who
surviv shall be run down as thei tri to run you down i will send
back the other pig to the sty with a messag choos children of
makedama which of you will live

each of them wa will to die that the other might go free therefor
both of them step forward sai that thei would fight the zulu
what is there honour among pig said chaka then i will settl it
see thi assegai i throw it into the air if the blade fall uppermost
the tall man shall go free if the shaft fall uppermost then life is
to the short on so and he sent the littl spear whirl round and
round in the air everi ey watch it as it wheel and fell the haft
struck the ground first

1 among the zulu it is a veri bad omen for a dog to climb the roof
of a hut the sai convei a threat to be appreci by everi

the man turn shook hi brother by the hand and went bear the
word of evil omen
then chaka call to the zulu and the last of those who had follow
us to kill us bid them fight so when thei had prais the princ
thei fought fierc and the end of it wa that the man of my peopl
conquer the zulu but as soon as he had found hi breath again he wa
set to run for hi life and after him ran five chosen men
still it came about that he outran them doubl like a hare and got
awai safe nor wa chaka angri at thi for i think that he bade the
men who hunt him to make speed slowli there wa onli on good thing
in the cruel heart of chaka that he would alwai save the life of a
brave man if he could do so without make hi word noth and for my
part i wa glad to think that the man of my peopl had conquer him

in the earththat wa all men women and children we wipe them out
the land wa clean of them next came the turn of ufaku chief of the
amapondo ah where is ufaku now
and so it went on and on till even the zulu were weari of war and the
sharpest assegai grew blunt
chapter vi the birth of umslopogaa
thi wa the rule of the life of chaka that he would have no children
though he had mani wive everi child born to him by hi sister wa
put awai at onc
what mopo he said to me shall i rear up children to put me to the
assegai when thei grow great thei call me tyrant sai how do those
chief die whom men name tyrant thei die at the hand of those whom
thei have bred nai mopo i will rule for my life and when i join the
spirit of my father let the strongest take my power and my place
now it chanc that shortli after chaka had spoken thu my sister
baleka the king wife fell in labour and on that same dai my wife
macropha wa brought to bed of twin and thi but eight dai after my
second wife anadi had given birth to a son you ask my father how
i came to be marri see that chaka forbad marriag to all hi
soldier till thei were in middl life and had put the man ring upon
their head it wa a boon he grant me as inyanga of medicin sai
it wa well that a doctor should know the sick of women and
learn how to cure their evil temper as though my father that were
possibl
when the king heard that baleka wa sick he did not kill her outright
becaus he love her a littl but he sent for me command me to
attend her and when the child wa born to caus it bodi to be brought
to him accord to custom so that he might be sure that it wa dead
i bent to the earth befor him and went to do hi bid with a heavi
heart for wa not baleka my sister and would not her child be of my
own blood still it must be so for chaka whisper wa as the shout of
other king and if we dare to disobei then our live and the live
of all in our kraal would answer for it better that an infant should
die than that we should becom food for jackal present i came to the
emposeni the place of the king wive and declar the king word to
the soldier on guard thei lower their assegai and let me pass and
i enter the hut of baleka in it were other of the king wive but
when thei saw me thei rose and went awai for it wa not law that
thei should stai where i wa thu i wa left alon with my sister
for awhil she lai silent and i did not speak though i saw by the
heav of her breast that she wa weep

it is the king child woman
it is the king child and it is not also my child must my babe be
drag from my breast and be strangl and by you mopo have i
not love you mopo did i not flee with you from our peopl and the

you pai me you come to kill my child my firstborn child
it is the king word woman i answer sternli but my heart wa
split in two within me
then baleka said no more but turn her face to the wall of the hut
she wept and groan bitterli
now as she wept i heard a stir without the hut and the light in the
doorwai wa darken a woman enter alon i look round to see
who it wa then fell upon the ground in salut for befor me wa
unandi mother of the king who wa name mother of the heaven that
same ladi to whom my mother had refus the milk

greet mopo she answer sai why doe baleka weep is it
becaus the sorrow of women is upon her

then baleka spoke i weep mother of a king becaus thi man who is
my brother ha come from him who is my lord and thei son to murder
that which shall be born of me o thou whose breast have given suck
plead for me thy son wa not slain at birth
perhap it were well if he had been so slain baleka said unandi
then had mani anoth man live to look upon the sun who is now dead

love him mother of the zulu
never baleka as a babe he bit my breast and tore my hair as the man

yet mai hi child be otherwis mother of the heaven think thou hast
no grandson to comfort thee in thy ag wilt thou then see all thy
stock wither the king our lord live in war he too mai die and what
then
then the root of senzangacona is still green ha the king no
brother
thei ar not of thei flesh mother what thou dost not hearken then
as a woman to woman i plead with thee save my child or slai me with my
child
now the heart of unandi grew gentl and she wa move to tear
how mai thi be done mopo she said the king must see the dead
infant and if he suspect and even reed have ear you know the heart
of chaka and where we shall lie tomorrow
ar there then no other newborn babe in zululand said baleka
sit up and speak in a whisper like the hiss of a snake listen

from zululand i could not and i dare not do thi thing what should
i kill my own child that it life might be given for the life of the
babe of baleka and should i lift up my will against the will of the
king save the child to look upon the sun which he had doom to
dark nai i would fly leav all and seek out some far tribe
where i might begin to live again here i could not live here in the
shadow of chaka wa noth but death

suffer none to enter the hut till i return i said and speak no word
of the child that seem to be dead if you allow ani to enter or if you
speak a word then my medicin will not work and the babe will be dead

chapter vii umslopogaa answer the king
now the year went on and thi matter slept noth more wa heard of
it but still it onli slept and my father i fear greatli for
the hour when it should awak for the secret wa known by two
womenunandi mother of the heaven and baleka my sister wife of the
king and by two moremacropha and anadi my wivesit wa guess at
how then should it remain a secret forev moreov it came about
that unandi and baleka could not restrain their fond for thi child
who wa call my son and name umslopogaa but who wa the son of
chaka the king and of the baleka and the grandson of unandi so it
happen that veri often on or the other of them would come into my
hut make pretenc to visit my wive and take the boi upon her lap
and fondl it in vain did i prai them to forbear love pull at their
heartstr more heavili than my word and still thei came thi wa
the end of itthat chaka saw the child sit on the knee of unandi
hi mother
what doe my mother with that brat of thine mopo he ask of me
cannot she kiss me if she will find a child to kiss and he laugh
like a wolf
i said that i did not know and the matter pass over for awhil
but after that chaka caus hi mother to be watch now the boi
umslopogaa grew great and strong there wa no such lad of hi year
for a dai journei round but from a babe he wa somewhat surli of few
word and like hi father chaka afraid of noth in all the world
there were but two peopl whom he lovedthes were i mopo who wa
call hi father and nada she who wa said to be hi twin sister
now it must be told of nada that as the boi umslopogaa wa the
strongest and bravest of children so the girl nada wa the gentlest and
most fair of a truth my father i believ that her blood wa not all
zulu though thi i cannot sai for certain at the least her ey were
softer and larger than those of our peopl her hair longer and less
tightli curl and her skin wa lightermor of the colour of pure
copper these thing she had from her mother macropha though she wa
fairer than macrophafair inde than ani woman of my peopl whom
i have seen her mother macropha my wife wa of swazi blood and wa
brought to the king kraal with other captiv after a raid and given
to me as a wife by the king it wa said that she wa the daughter of a
swazi headman of the tribe of the halakazi and that she wa born of hi
wife is true but whether he wa her father i do not know for i have
heard from the lip of macropha herself that befor she wa born there
wa a white man stai at her father kraal he wa a portugues from
the coast a handsom man and skill in the work of iron thi
white man love the mother of my wife macropha and some held that
macropha wa hi daughter and not that of the swazi headman at least
i know thi that befor my wife birth the swazi kill the white man
but none can tell the truth of these matter and i onli speak of them
becaus the beauti of nada wa rather as is the beauti of the white
peopl than of our and thi might well happen if her grandfath
chanc to be a white man
now umslopogaa and nada were alwai togeth togeth thei at
togeth thei slept and wander thei thought on thought and spoke
with on tongu ou it wa pretti to see them twice while thei were
still children did umslopogaa save the life of nada
the first time it came about thu the two children had wander far
from the kraal seek certain berri that littl on love on thei
wander and on sing as thei went till at length thei found the
berri and at heartili then it wa near sundown and when thei had
eaten thei fell asleep in the night thei woke to find a great wind
blow and a cold rain fall on them for it wa the begin of
winter when fruit ar ripe
up nada said umslopogaa we must seek the kraal or the cold will
kill us
so nada rose frighten and hand in hand thei stumbl through the
dark but in the wind and the night thei lost their path and when
at length the dawn came thei were in a forest that wa strang to them
thei rest awhil and find berri at them then walk again
all that dai thei wander till at last the night came down and thei
pluck branch of tree and pile the branch over them for warmth
and thei were so weari that thei fell asleep in each other arm at
dawn thei rose but now thei were veri tire and berri were few so
that by middai thei were spent then thei lai down on the side of a
steep hill and nada laid her head upon the breast of umslopogaa
here let us die my brother she said
but even then the boi had a great spirit and he answer time to die
sister when death choos us see now do you rest here and i will
climb the hill and look across the forest
so he left her and climb the hill and on it side he found mani
berri and a root that is good for food and fill himself with them
at length he came to the crest of the hill and look out across the sea
of green lo there far awai to the east he saw a line of white that
lai like smoke against the black surfac of a cliff and knew it for the
waterfal beyond the royal town then he came down the hill shout
for joi and bear root and berri in hi hand but when he reach
the spot where nada wa he found that her sens had left her through
hunger cold and weari she lai upon the ground like on asleep
and over her stood a jackal that fled as he drew nigh now it would seem
that there but two shoot to the stick of umslopogaa on wa to save
himself and the other to lie down and die by nada yet he found a
third for undo the strip of hi moocha he made rope of them
and with the rope he bound nada on hi back and start for the king
kraal he could never have reach it for the wai wa long yet at
even some messeng run through the forest came upon a nake
lad with a girl bound to hi back and a staff in hi hand who stagger
along slowli with start ey and foam upon hi lip he could not
speak he wa so weari and the rope had cut through the skin of hi
shoulder yet on of the messeng knew him for umslopogaa the son
of mopo and thei bore him to the kraal thei would have left the girl
nada think her dead but he point to her breast and feel it
thei found that her heart still beat so thei brought her also and the
end of it wa that both recov and love each other more than ever
befor
now after thi i mopo bade umslopogaa stai at home within the kraal
and not lead hi sister to the wild but the boi love roam like a
fox and where he went there nada follow so it came about that on
dai thei slip from the kraal when the gate were open and sought out
a certain deep glen which had an evil name for it wa said that spirit
haunt it and put those to death who enter there whether thi wa
true i do not know but i know that in the glen dwelt a certain woman
of the wood who had her habit in a cave and live upon what she
could kill or steal or dig up with her hand now thi woman wa
mad for it had chanc that her husband had been smelt out by the
witchdoctor as a worker of magic against the king and slain then
chaka accord to custom despatch the slayer to eat up hi kraal
and thei came to the kraal and kill hi peopl last of all thei
kill hi children three young girl and would have assegai their
mother when suddenli a spirit enter into her at the sight and she
went mad so that thei let her go be afraid to touch her afterward
so she fled and took up her abod in the haunt glen and thi wa
the natur of her mad that whenev she saw children and more
especi girl children a long came upon her to kill them as her
own had been kill thi inde she did often for when the moon
wa full and her mad at it highest she would travel far to find
children snatch them awai from the kraal like a hyena still
none would touch her becaus of the spirit in her not even those whose
children she had murder
so umslopogaa and nada came to the glen where the childslay live
and sat down by a pool of water not far from the mouth of her cave
weav flower into a garland present umslopogaa left nada to
search for rock lili which she love as he went he call back to
her and hi voic awok the woman who wa sleep in her cave for
she came out by night onli like a jackal then the woman step forth
smell blood and have a spear in her hand present she saw nada
seat upon the grass weav flower and crept toward her to kill
her now as she cameso the child told mesuddenli a cold wind seem
to breath upon nada and fear took hold of her though she did not see
the woman who would murder her she let fall the flower and look
befor her into the pool and there mirror in the pool she saw the
greedi face of the childslay who crept down upon her from abov
her hair hang about her brow and her ey shine like the ey of a
lion
then with a cry nada sprang up and fled along the path which umslopogaa
had taken and after her leapt and ran the mad woman umslopogaa heard
her cry he turn and rush back over the brow of the hill and lo
there befor him wa the murderess alreadi she had grasp nada by the
hair alreadi her spear wa lift to pierc her umslopogaa had no
spear he had noth but a littl stick without a knob yet with it he
rush at the mad woman and struck her so smartli on the arm that she
let go of the girl and turn on him with a yell then lift her
spear she struck at him but he leapt asid again she struck but he
sprang into the air and the spear pass beneath him a third time the
woman struck and though he fell to earth to avoid the blow yet the
assegai pierc hi shoulder but the weight of hi bodi as he fell
twist it from her hand and befor she could grasp him he wa up and
beyond her reach the spear still fast in hi shoulder
then the woman turn scream with rage and mad and ran at nada
to kill her with her hand but umslopogaa set hi teeth and draw
the spear from hi wound charg her shout she lift a great
stone and hurl it at himso hard that it flew into fragment against
anoth stone which it struck yet he charg on and smote at her so
truli that he drove the spear through her and she fell down dead after
that nada bound up hi wound which wa deep and with much pain he
reach the king kraal and told me thi stori
now there were some who cri that the boi must be put to death becaus
he had kill on possess with a spirit but i said no he should not
be touch he had kill the woman in defenc of hi own life and the
life of hi sister and everi on had a right to slai in selfdef
except as against the king or those who did the king bid
moreov i said if the woman had a spirit it wa an evil on for no
good spirit would ask the live of children but rather those of cattl
for it is against our custom to sacrific human be to the amatonga
even in war though the basuta dog do so still the tumult grew for
the witchdoctor were set upon the boi death sai that evil would
come of it if he wa allow to live have kill on inspir and at
last the matter came to the ear of the king then chaka summon me and
the boi befor him and he also summon the witchdoctor
first the witchdoctor set out their case demand the death of
umslopogaa chaka ask them what would happen if the boi wa not
kill thei answer that the spirit of the dead woman would lead him
to bring evil on the royal hous chaka ask if he would bring evil on

him but on on of the royal hous who should be after him chaka said
that he care noth what happen to those who came after him or

that is noth said chaka if i order thee to be kill for ani
caus should i not also order all within thy gate to be kill with

now i grew afraid for i fear lest chaka should slai him who
wa call my son becaus of the word of the doctor but the boi
umslopogaa look up and answer boldli not as on who plead for hi
life but as on who demand a right
i have thi to sai eaterup of enemi and if it is not enough let

so we went out but as we pass them i saw the doctor mutter
togeth for thei were illpleas and forebod evil also thei were
jealou of me and wish to smite me through the heart of him who wa

chapter viii the great ingomboco
after thi there wa quiet until the feast of the firstfruit wa
end but few peopl were kill at these feast though there wa
a great ingomboco or witchhunt and mani were smelt out by the
witchdoctor as work magic against the king now thing had come
to thi pass in zululandthat the whole peopl cower befor the
witchdoctor no man might sleep safe for none knew but that on the
morrow he would be touch by the wand of an isanusi as we name a
finder of witch and led awai to hi death for awhil chaka said
noth and so long as the doctor smelt out those onli whom he wish
to get rid ofand thei were manyh wa well pleas but when thei
began to work for their own end and to do those to death whom he did
not desir to kill he grew angri yet the custom of the land wa
that he whom the witchdoctor touch must die he and all hi hous
therefor the king wa in a cleft stick for he scarc dare to save
even those whom he love on night i came to doctor him for he wa
sick in hi mind on that veri dai there had been an ingomboco and five
of the bravest captain of the armi had been smelt out by the abangoma

he said to me where then is it to end shall i myself be smelt out
and slain these isanusi ar too strong for me thei lie upon the land
like the shadow of night tell me how mai i be free of them
those who walk the bridg of spear o king fall off into nowher
i answer darkli even witchdoctor cannot keep a foot on that
bridg ha not a witchdoctor a heart that can ceas to beat ha he
not blood that can be made to flow
chaka look at me strang thou art a bold man who darest to speak
thu to me mopo he said dost thou not know that it is sacrileg to
touch an isanusi
i speak that which is in the king mind i answer hearken o
king it is inde sacrileg to touch a true isanusi but what if the
isanusi be a liar what if he smell out fals bring those to death
who ar innoc of evil is it then sacrileg to bring him to that end
which he ha given to mani anoth sai o king
good word answer chaka now tell me son of makedama how mai
thi matter be put to proof
then i lean forward whisper into the ear of the black on and he
nod heavili
thu i spoke then becaus i too saw the evil of the isanusi i who
knew their secret also i fear for my own life and for the live of
all those who were dear to me for thei hate me as on instruct in
their magic on who had the see ey and the hear ear
on morn thereaft a new thing came to pass in the royal kraal for
the king himself ran out cry aloud to all peopl to come and see the
evil that had been work upon him by a wizard thei came togeth and
saw thi on the doorpost of the gatewai of the intunkulu the hous
of the king were great smear of blood the knee of men strong in the
battl trembl when thei saw it women wail aloud as thei wail over
the dead thei wail becaus of the horror of the omen
who ha done thi thing cri chaka in a terribl voic who ha
dare to bewitch the king and to strike blood upon hi hous
there wa no answer and chaka spoke again thi is no littl matter
he said to be wash awai with the blood of on or two and be
forgotten the man who wrought it shall not die alon or travel with a
few to the world of spirit all hi tribe shall go with him down to
the babi in hi hut and cattl in hi kraal let messeng go out east

quarter let them summon the captain from everi regiment and the
headmen from everi kraal on the tenth dai from now the circl of the
ingomboco must be set and there shall be such a smell out of wizard
and of witch as ha not been known in zululand
so the messeng went out to do the bid of the king take the
name of those who should be summon from the lip of the induna
and dai by dai peopl flock up to the gate of the royal kraal and
creep on their knee befor the majesti of the king prais him
aloud but he vouchsaf an answer to none on nobl onli he caus to
be kill becaus he carri in hi hand a stick of the royal red wood
which chaka himself had given him in bygon year 1
1 thi beauti wood is known in natal as red ivori
on the last night befor the form of the ingomboco the
witchdoctor male and femal enter the kraal there were a hundr
and a half of them and thei were made hideou and terribl with the
white bone of men with bladder of fish and of oxen with fat of

red rise the moon oer the plain red sink the sun in the west
look wizard and bid them farewel

then thei were silent and went in silenc to the place appoint for
them there to pass the night in mutter and magic but those who
were gather togeth shiver with fear when thei heard their word
for thei knew well that mani a man would be switch with the gnu tail
befor the sun sank onc more and i too trembl for my heart wa
full of fear ah my father those were evil dai to live in when chaka

peopl and on at the slayer and wherev hi ey fell men turn grei
with fear then he stalk on and sat himself upon a stool to the north
of the great ring look toward the open space
for awhil there wa silenc then from the gate of the women
quarter came a band of maiden arrai in their bead dancingdress
and carri green branch in their hand as thei came thei clap
their hand and sang softli
we ar the herald of the king feast ai ai

thei ceas and rang themselv in a bodi behind us then chaka held

in the air behind them their face shone with the fat of anoint
their ey start like the ey of fish and their lip twitch
hungrili as thei glare round the deathr ha ha littl did those
evil children guess who should be the slayer and who should be the

then ten of the women stood forward and at their head wa the most
famou witchdoctress of that dayan ag woman name nobela a woman

who heard the voic of the dead as thei cri in the night and spoke

then thei crept nearer crept on their hand and knee till thei were

the fierc face of the isanusi befor me as thei crept crept like
snake i glanc behind and saw the slayer grasp their kerri for
the deed of death and i sai i felt like on for whom the bitter is
overpast then i rememb the word which the king and i had whisper
togeth of the caus for which thi ingomboco wa set and hope crept
back to me like the first gleam of the dawn upon a stormi night still
i did not hope overmuch for it well might happen that the king had but
set a trap to catch me
now thei were quit near and halt

thei lift their head from the ground like snake and nod and as

thei drew their head to a circl and nobela thrust her into the
centr of the circl and said a word

i saw her come i felt the blow on my face as a man feel in a dream i
heard the feet of the slayer as thei bound forward to hale me to the
dread death but my tongu clave to the roof of my mouthi could not
sai a word i glanc at the king and as i did so i thought that i
heard him mutter near the mark not in it
then he held up hi spear and all wa silenc the slayer stop in
their stride the witchdoctor stood with outstretch arm the world
of men wa as though it had been frozen into sleep
hold he said stand asid son of makedama who art name an
evildo stand asid thou nobela and those with thee who have name
him evildo what shall i be satisfi with the life of on dog smell
on ye vultur compani by compani smell on for the dai the labour
at night the feast
i rose astonish and stood on on side the witchdoctress also
stood on on side wonderstruck sinc no such smell out as thi had
been seen in the land for till thi hour when a man wa swept with the
gnu tail of the isanusi that wa the instant of hi death why then
men ask in their heart wa the death delai the witchdoctor
ask it also and look to the king for light as men look to a
thundercloud for the flash but from the black on there came no word
so we stood on on side and a second parti of the isanusi women began
their rite as the other had done so thei did and yet thei work
otherwis for thi is the fashion of the isanusi that no two of them
smell out in the same wai and thi parti swept the face of certain of
the king councillor name them guilti of the witchwork
stand ye on on side said the king to those who had been smelt out
and ye who have hunt out their wicked stand ye with those who
name mopo son of makedama it well mai be that all ar guilti
so these stood on on side also and a third parti took up the tale
and thei name certain of the great gener and were in turn bidden to
stand on on side togeth with those whom thei had name
so it went on through all the dai compani by compani the women doom
their victim till there were no more left in their number and were
command to stand asid togeth with those whom thei had doom then
the male isanusi began and i could see well that by thi time their
heart were fear for thei smelt a snare yet the king bid must
be done and though their magic fail them here victim must be found
so thei smelt out thi man and that man till we were a great compani of
the doom who sat in silenc on the ground look at each other with
sad ey and watch the sun which we deem our last climb slowli
down the sky and ever as the dai wane those who were left untri of
the witchdoctor grew madder and more fierc thei leap into the air
thei ground their teeth and roll upon the ground thei drew forth
snake and devour them aliv thei shriek out to the spirit and
call upon the name of ancient king
at length it drew on to even and the last compani of the
witchdoctor did their work smell out some of the keeper of
the emposeni the hous of the women but there wa on man of their
compani a young man and a tall who held back and took no share in the
work but stood by himself in the centr of the great circl fix hi
ey on the heaven
and when thi compani had been order to stand asid also togeth with
those whom thei had smelt out the king call aloud to the last of the
witchdoctor ask him of hi name and tribe and why he alon did
not do hi offic
my name is indabazimbi the son of arpi o king he answer and i
am of the tribe of the maquilisini doe the king bid me to smell out
him of whom the spirit have spoken to me as the worker of thi deed
i bid thee said the king
then the young man indabazimbi step straight forward across the ring
make no cri or gestur but as on who walk from hi gate to the
cattl kraal and suddenli he struck the king in the face with the tail
in hi hand sai i smell out the heaven abov me 2
2 a zulu titl for the king
now a great gasp of wonder went up from the multitud and all look to
see thi fool kill by tortur but chaka rose and laugh aloud
thou hast said it he cri and thou alon listen ye peopl i did
the deed i smote blood upon the gatewai of my kraal with my own hand
i smote it that i might learn who were the true doctor and who were
the fals now it seem that in the land of the zulu there is on true
doctorthi young manand of the fals look at them and count them
thei ar like the leav see there thei stand and by them stand those
whom thei have doomedth innoc whom with their wive and children
thei have doom to the death of the dog now i ask you my peopl what
reward shall be given to them
then a great roar went up from all the multitud let them die o
king
ay he answer let them die as liar should
now the isanusi men and women scream aloud in fear and cri for
merci tear themselv with their nail for least of all thing did
thei desir to tast of their own medicin of death but the king onli
laugh the more
hearken ye he said point to the crowd of us who had been
smelt out ye were doom to death by these fals prophet now glut
yourselv upon them slai them my children slai them all wipe them
awai stamp them outal all save thi young man
then we bound from the ground for our heart were fierc with hate
and with long to aveng the terror we had born the doom slew the
doomer while from the circl of the ingomboco a great roar of laughter
went up for men rejoic becaus the burden of the witchdoctor had
fallen from them
at last it wa done and we drew back from the heap of the dead
noth wa heard there nowno more cri or prayer or curs the
witchfind travel the path on which thei had set the feet of mani
the king drew near to look he came alon and all who had done hi
bid bent their head and crept past him prais him as thei went
onli i stood still cover as i wa with mire and filth for i did not
fear to stand in the presenc of the king chaka drew near and look
at the piledup heap of the slain and the cloud of dust that yet hung
over them
there thei lie mopo he said there lie those who dare to propheci
fals to the king that wa a good word of thine mopo which taught
me to set the snare for them yet methought i saw thee start when
nobela queen of the witchdoctress switch death on thee well
thei ar dead and the land breath more freeli and for the evil which
thei have done it is as yonder dust that shall soon sink again to
earth and there be lost
thu he spoke then ceasedfor lo someth move beneath the cloud
of dust someth broke a wai through the heap of the dead slowli it
forc it path push the slain thi wai and that till at length it
stood upon it feet and totter toward usa thing dread to look
on the shape wa the shape of an ag woman and even through the blood
and mire i knew her it wa nobela she who had doom me she whom but
now i had smitten to earth but who had come back from the dead to curs
me
on she totter her apparel hang round her in red rag a hundr
wound upon her face and form i saw that she wa dy but life still
flicker in her and the fire of hate burn in her snaki ey
hail king she scream
peac liar he answer thou art dead
not yet king i heard thy voic and the voic of yonder dog whom i
would have given to the jackal and i will not die till i have spoken
i smelt him out thi morn when i wa aliv now that i am as on
alreadi dead i smell him out again he shall bewitch thee with blood
inde chakah and unandi thy mother and baleka thy wife think of
my word when the assegai redden befor thee for the last time king
farewel and she utter a great cry and roll upon the ground dead
the witch li hard and di hard said the king carelessli and
turn upon hi heel but those word of dead nobela remain fix in
hi memori or so much of them as had been spoken of unandi and baleka
there thei remain like seed in the earth there thei grew to bring
forth fruit in their season
and thu end the great ingomboco of chaka the greatest ingomboco that
ever wa held in zululand
chapter ix the loss of umslopogaa
now after the smell out of the witchdoctor chaka caus a watch
to be kept upon hi mother unandi and hi wife baleka my sister and
report wa brought to him by those who watch that the two women came
to my hut by stealth and there kiss and nurs a boyon of
my children then chaka rememb the propheci of nobela the dead
isanusi and hi heart grew dark with doubt but to me he said noth
of the matter for then as alwai hi ey look over my head he did
not fear me or believ that i plot against him i who wa hi dog
still he did thi though whether by chanc or design i do not know he
bade me go on a journei to a distant tribe that live near the border
of the amaswazi there to take count of certain of the king cattl
which were in the charg of that tribe and to bring him account of
the tale of their increas so i bow befor the king and said that
i would run like a dog to do hi bid and he gave me men to go with
me
then i return to my hut to bid farewel to my wive and children
and there i found that my wife anadi the mother of moosa my son had
fallen sick with a wander sick for strang thing came into her
mind and what came into her mind that she said be as i did not
doubt bewitch by some enemi of my hous
still i must go upon the king busi and i told thi to my wife
macropha the mother of nada and as it wa thought of umslopogaa
the son of chaka but when i spoke to macropha of the matter she burst
into tear and clung to me i ask her why she wept thu and she
answer that the shadow of evil lai upon her heart for she wa sure
that if i left her at the king kraal when i return again i should
find neither her nor nada my child nor umslopogaa who wa name my
son and whom i love as a son still in the land of life then i tri
to calm her but the more i strove the more she wept sai that she
knew well that these thing would be so
now i ask her what could be done for i wa stir by her tear and
the dread of evil crept from her to me as shadow creep from the vallei
to the mountain
she answer take me with you my husband that i mai leav thi evil
land where the veri ski rain blood and let me rest awhil in the
place of my own peopl till the terror of chaka ha gone by
how can i do thi i said none mai leav the king kraal without
the king pass
a man mai put awai hi wife she repli the king doe not stand
between a man and hi wife sai my husband that you love me no longer
that i bear you no more children and that therefor you send me back
whenc i came byandby we will come togeth again if we ar left
among the live
so be it i answer leav the kraal with nada and umslopogaa thi
night and tomorrow morn meet me at the river bank and we shall
go on togeth and for the rest mai the spirit of our father hold us
safe
so we kiss each other and macropha went on secretli with the
children
now at the dawn on the morrow i summon the men whom the king had
given me and we start upon our journei when the sun wa well up we
came to the bank of the river and there i found my wife macropha and
with her the two children thei rose as i came but i frown at my wife
and she gave me no greet those with me look at her askanc
i have divorc thi woman i said to them she is a wither tree a
worn out old hag and now i take her with me to send her to the countri
of the swazi whenc she came ceas weep i ad to macropha it
is my last word
what sai the king ask the men
i will answer to the king i said and we went on
now i must tell how we lost umslopogaa the son of chaka who wa then
a great lad draw on to manhood fierc in temper well grown and
broad for hi year
we had journei seven dai for the wai wa long and on the night of
the seventh dai we came to a mountain countri in which there were few
kraal for chaka had eaten them all up year befor perhap you know
the place my father in it is a great and strang mountain it is
haunt also and name the ghost mountain and on the top of it is a
grei peak rude shape like the head of an ag woman here in thi
wild place we must sleep for dark drew on now we soon learn that
there were mani lion in the rock around for we heard their roar
and were much afraid all except umslopogaa who fear noth so we
made a circl of thornbush and sat in it hold our assegai readi
present the moon came upit wa a fullgrown moon and veri bright so
bright that we could see everyth for a long wai round now some six
spearthrow from where we sat wa a cliff and at the top of the cliff
wa a cave and in thi cave live two lion and their young when the
moon grew bright we saw the lion come out and stand upon the edg of
the cliff and with them were two littl on that plai about like
kitten so that had we not been frighten it would have been beauti
to see them
oh umslopogaa said nada i wish that i had on of the littl lion
for a dog
the boi laugh sai then shall i fetch you on sister
peac boi i said no man mai take young lion from their lair and
live
such thing have been done my father he answer laugh and no
more wa said of the matter
now when the cub had plai awhil we saw the lioness take up the cub
in her mouth and carri them into the cave then she came out again and
went awai with her mate to seek food and soon we heard them roar
in the distanc now we stack up the fire and went to sleep in our
enclosur of thorn without fear for we knew that the lion were far
awai eat game but umslopogaa did not sleep for he had determin
that he would fetch the cub which nada had desir and be young
and foolhardi he did not think of the danger which he would bring upon
himself and all of us he knew no fear and now as ever if nada spoke
a word nai even if she thought of a thing to desir it he would not
rest till it wa won for her so while we slept umslopogaa crept like
a snake from the fenc of thorn and take an assegai in hi hand
he slip awai to the foot of the cliff where the lion had their den
then he climb the cliff and come to the cave enter there and
grope hi wai into it the cub heard him and think that it wa
their mother who return began to whine and purr for food guid by
the light of their yellow ey he crept over the bone of which there
were mani in the cave and came to where thei lai then he put out hi
hand and seiz on of the cub kill the other with hi assegai
becaus he could not carri both of them now he made hast thenc befor
the lion return and came back to the thorn fenc where we lai just
as dawn as break
i awok at the come of the dawn and stand up i look out lo
there on the farther side of the thorn fenc look larg in the
grei mist stood the lad umslopogaa laugh in hi teeth he held the
assegai yet drip with blood and in hi hand the lion cub that
despit it whine and struggl he grasp by the skin of the neck and
the hind leg
awak my sister he cri here is the dog you seek ah he bite
now but he will soon grow tame
nada awok and rise cri out with joi at the sight of the cub but
for a moment i stood astonish
fool i cri at last let the cub go befor the lion come to rend
us
i will not let it go my father he answer sullenli ar there not
five of us with spear and can we not fight two cat i wa not afraid
to go alon into their den ar you all afraid to meet them in the
open
you ar mad i said let the cub go and i ran toward umslopogaa
to take it from him but he sprang asid and avoid me
i will never let that go of which i have got hold he said at least
not live and suddenli he seiz the head of the cub and twist it
neck then threw it on to the ground and ad see now i have done
your bid my father
as he spoke we heard a great sound of roar from the cave in the
cliff the lion had return and found on cub dead and the other gone
into the fenceback into the fenc i cri and we sprang over
the thornbush where those with us were make readi their spear
trembl as thei handl them with fear and the cold of the morn we
look up there down the side of the cliff came the lion bound
on the scent of him who had rob them of their young the lion ran
first and as he came he roar then follow the lioness but she did
not roar for in her mouth wa the cub that umslopogaa had assegai in
the cave now thei drew near mad with furi their mane bristl and
lash their flank with their long tail
curs you for a fool son of mopo said on of the men with me to
umslopogaa present i will beat you till the blood come for thi
trick
first beat the lion then beat me if you can answer the lad and
wait to curs till you have done both
now the lion were close to us thei came to the bodi of the second cub
that lai outsid the fenc of thorn the lion stop and snif it
then he roaredah he roar till the earth shook as for the lioness
she drop the dead cub which she wa carri and took the other into
her mouth for she could not carri both
get behind me nada cri umslopogaa brandish hi spear the
lion is about to spring
as the word left hi mouth the great brute crouch to the ground then
suddenli he sprang from it like a bird and like a bird he travel
through the air toward us
catch him on the spear cri umslopogaa and by natur as it were
we did the boi bid for huddl ourselv togeth we held out
the assegai so that the lion fell upon them as he sprang and their
blade sank far into him but the weight of hi charg carri us to
the ground and he fell on to us strike at us and at the spear and
roar with pain and furi as he struck present he wa on hi leg
bite at the spear in hi breast then umslopogaa who alon did not
wait hi onslaught but had step asid for hi own end utter a
loud cry and drove hi assegai into the lion behind the shoulder so
that with a groan the brute roll over dead
meanwhil the lioness stood without the fenc the second dead cub in
her mouth for she could not bring herself to leav either of them but
when she heard her mate last groan she drop the cub and gather
herself togeth to spring umslopogaa alon stood up to face her
for he onli had withdrawn hi assegai from the carcass of the lion she
swept on toward the lad who stood like a stone to meet her now she
met hi spear it sunk in it snap and down fell umslopogaa dead
or senseless beneath the mass of the lioness she sprang up the broken
spear stand in her breast snif at umslopogaa then as though
she knew that it wa he who had rob her she seiz him by the loin
and moocha and sprang with him over the fenc
oh save him cri the girl nada in bitter woe and we rush after
the lioness shout
for a moment she stood over her dead cub umslopogaa hang from her
mouth and look at them as though she wonder and we hope that she
might let him fall then hear our cri she turn and bound awai
toward the bush bear umslopogaa in her mouth we seiz our spear
and follow but the ground grew stoni and search as we would we
could find no trace of umslopogaa or of the lioness thei had vanish
like a cloud so we came back and ah my heart wa sore for i love
the lad as though he had inde been my son but i knew that he wa
dead and there wa an end
where is my brother cri nada when we came back
lost i answer lost never to be found again
then the girl gave a great and bitter cry and fell to the earth sai
i would that i were dead with my brother
let us be go said macropha my wife
have you no tear to weep for your son ask a man of our compani
what is the us of weep over the dead doe it then bring them
back she answer let us be go
the man thought these word strang but he did not know that
umslopogaa wa not born of macropha
still we wait in that place a dai think that perhap the
lioness would return to her den and that at least we might kill her
but she came back no more so on the next morn we roll up our
blanket and start forward on our journei sad at heart in truth
nada wa so weak from grief that she could hardli travel but i never
heard the name of umslopogaa pass her lip again dure that journei
she buri him in her heart and said noth and i too said noth
but i wonder why it had been brought about that i should save the life
of umslopogaa from the jaw of the lion of zulu that the lioness of
the rock might devour him
and so the time went on till we reach the kraal where the king
busi must be done and where i and my wife should part
on the morn after we came to the kraal have kiss in secret
though in public we look sullenli on on anoth we part as those
part who meet no more for it wa in our thought that we should never
see each other face again nor inde did we do so and i drew nada
asid and spoke to her thu we part my daughter nor do i know when
we shall meet again for the time ar troubl and it is for your
safeti and that of your mother that i rob my ey of the sight of you
nada you will soon be a woman and you will be fairer than ani woman
among our peopl and it mai come about that mani great men will seek
you in marriag and perhap that i your father shall not be there
to choos for you whom you shall wed accord to the custom of our
land but i charg you as far as mai be possibl for you to do so take
onli a man whom you can love and be faith to him alon for thu
shall a woman find happi
here i stop for the girl took hold of my hand and look into my
face peac my father she said do not speak to me of marriag
for i will wed no man now that umslopogaa is dead becaus of my
foolish i will live and die alon and oh mai i die quickli that
i mai go to seek him whom i love onli
nai nada i said umslopogaa wa your brother and it is not
fit that you should speak of him thu even though he is dead
i know noth of such matter my father she said i speak what my
heart tell me and it tell me that i love umslopogaa live and
though he is dead i shall love him alon to the end ah you think me
but a child yet my heart is larg and it doe not lie to me
now i upbraid the girl no more becaus i knew that umslopogaa wa
not her brother but on whom she might have marri onli i marvel
that the voic of natur should speak so truli in her tell her that
which wa law even when it seem to be most unlaw
speak no more of umslopogaa i said for sure he is dead and
though you cannot forget him yet speak of him no more and i prai of
you my daughter that if we do not meet again yet you should keep me
in your memori and the love i bear you and the word which from
time to time i have said to you the world is a thorni wilder my
daughter and it thorn ar water with a rain of blood and we wander
in our wretched like lost travel in a mist nor do i know why
our feet ar set on thi wander but at last there come an end and
we die and go henc none know where but perhap where we go the evil
mai chang to the good and those who were dear to each other on the
earth mai becom yet dearer in the heaven for i believ that man
is not born to perish altogeth but is rather gather again to the
umkulunkulu who sent him on hi journei therefor keep hope my
daughter for if these thing ar not so at least sleep remain and
sleep is soft and so farewel
then we kiss and part and i watch macropha my wife and nada
my daughter till thei melt into the sky as thei walk upon
their journei to swaziland and wa veri sad becaus have lost
umslopogaa he who in after dai wa name the slaughter and the
woodpeck i must lose them also

into the emposeni and so swiftli that the guard at the gate could not
stop her but when she reach her own hut baleka strength fail her
and she fell senseless on the ground but the boi moosa my son be
overcom with terror stai where he wa and chaka believ him to
be hi son murder him also and with hi own hand
then he stalk out of the hut and leav the three guard at the
gate command a compani of soldier to surround the kraal and fire it
thi thei did and as the peopl rush out thei kill them and those
who did not run out were burn in the fire thu then perish all my
wive my children my servant and those who were within the gate in
their compani the tree wa burn and the bee in it and i alon wa
left livingi and macropha and nada who were far awai
nor wa chaka yet satisfi with blood for as ha been told he sent
messeng bid them kill macropha my wife and nada my daughter
and him who wa name by son but he command the messeng that thei
should not slai me but bring me live befor them
now when the soldier did not kill me i took counsel with myself for it
wa my belief that i wa save aliv onli that i might die later and
in a more cruel fashion therefor for awhil i thought that it would be
well if i did that for myself which anoth purpos to do for me why
should i who wa alreadi doom wait to meet my doom what had i left
to keep me in the place of life see that all whom i love were
dead or gone to die would be easi for i knew the wai of death in my
girdl i carri a secret medicin he who eat of it my father will
see the sun shadow move no more and will never look upon the star
again but i wa mind to know the assegai or the kerri nor would i
perish more slowli beneath the knive of the tormentor nor be parch
by the pang of thirst or wander eyeless to my end therefor it wa
that sinc i had sat in the doom ring look hour after hour into the
face of death i had born thi medicin with me by night and by dai
sure now wa the time to us it
so i thought as i sat through the watch of the night ay and drew out
the bitter drug and laid it on my tongu but as i did so i rememb
my daughter nada who wa left to me though she sojourn in a far
countri and my wife macropha and my sister baleka who still live so
said the soldier though how it came about that the king had not kill
her i did not know then also anoth thought wa born in my heart
while life remain to me i might be reveng upon him who had wrought
me thi woe but can the dead strike ala the dead ar strengthless
and if thei still have heart to suffer thei have no hand to give back
blow for blow nai i would live on time to die when death could no
more be put awai time to die when the voic of chaka spoke my doom
death choos for himself and answer no question he is a guest to
whom none need open the door of hi hut for when he will he can pass
through the thatch like air not yet would i tast of that medicin of
mine
so i live on my father and the soldier led me back to the kraal of
chaka now when we came to the kraal it wa night for the sun had sunk
as we pass through the gate still as he had been command the
captain of those who watch me went in befor the king and told him
that i lai without in bond and the king said let him be brought
befor me who wa my physician that i mai tell him how i have doctor
those of hi hous
so thei took me and led me to the royal hous and push me through the
doorwai of the great hut
now a fire burn in the hut for the night wa cold and chaka sat on
the further side of the fire look toward the open of the hut
and the smoke from the fire wreath him round and it light shone upon
hi face and flicker in hi terribl ey
at the door of the hut certain councillor seiz me by the arm and
drag me toward the fire but i broke from them and prostrat
myself for my arm were free i prais the king and call him by hi
royal name the councillor sprang toward me to seiz me again
but chaka said let him be i would talk with my servant then the
councillor bow themselv on either side and laid their hand on
their stick their forehead touch the ground but i sat down on the
floor of the hut over against the king and we talk through the fire
tell me of the cattl that i sent thee to number mopo son of
makedama said chaka have my servant dealt honestli with my cattl
thei have dealt honestli o king i answer
tell me then of the number of the cattl and of their mark mopo
forget none
so i sat and told him ox by ox cow by cow and heifer by heifer
forget none and chaka listen silent as on who is asleep but i
knew that he did not sleep for all the while the firelight flicker
in hi fierc ey also i knew that he did but torment me or that
perhap he would learn of the cattl befor he kill me at length all
the tale wa told
so said the king it goe well there ar yet honest men left in the
land knowest thou mopo that sorrow ha come upon thy hous while thou

my ehlos who had put into my heart those word which i should answer
i hope also that chaka would now let me go but it wa not to be for
thi wa but the begin of my trial
knowest thou mopo said the king that as my mother di yonder in
the flame of thy kraal she cri out strang and terribl word which
came to my ear through the sing of the fire these were her word

great voic nai mopo be not so backward shall i sit warm and see

fear for i saw that if i did noth death would swiftli end my doubt

firenot into the hottest of the fire but where the smoke leapt from
the flame now my flesh wa wet with the sweat of fear and for a littl
moment the flame curl round it and did not burn me but i knew that
the torment wa to come

the heat and the flame got hold of me and at into my flesh and it
torment wa great but of thi i show no sign upon my face for i knew
well that if i show sign or utter cry then have fail in the

the heaven and the earth unseen and unheard and thu i prai that i
might yet live to kill chaka as he had kill those who were dear to me
and while i prai i slept or if i did not sleep the light of thought
went out of me and i becam as on dead then there came a vision to
me a vision that wa sent in answer to my prayer or perchanc it
wa a mad born of my sorrow for my father it seem to me that i
stood upon the bank of a great and wide river it wa gloomi there the
light lai low upon the face of the river but far awai on the farther
side wa a glow like the glow of a stormi dawn and in the glow i saw a
mighti bed of reed that swai about in the breath of dawn and out of
the reed came men and women and children by hundr and thousand
and plung into the water of the river and were buffet about by
them now my father all the peopl that i saw in the water were black
peopl and all those who were torn out of the reed were blackthei
were none of them white like your peopl my father for thi vision wa
a vision of the zulu race who alon ar torn out of the reed now
i saw that of those who swam in the river some pass over veri quickli
and some stood still as it were still in the watera in life
my father some die soon and some live for mani year and i saw the
countless face of those in the water among them were mani that i knew
there my father i saw the face of chaka and near him wa my own face
there too i saw the face of dingaan the princ hi brother and the
face of the boi umslopogaa and the face of nada my daughter and then
for the first time i knew that umslopogaa wa not dead but onli lost
now i turn in my vision and look at that bank of the river on which
i stood then i saw that behind the bank wa a cliff mighti and black
and in the cliff were door of ivori and through them came light and
the sound of laughter there were other door also black as though
fashion of coal and through them came dark and the sound of
groan i saw also that in front of the door wa set a seat and on the
seat wa the figur of a gloriou woman she wa tall and she alon wa
white and clad in robe of white and her hair wa like gold which is
molten in the fire and her face shone like the middai sun then i saw
that those who came up out of the river stood befor the woman the
water yet run from them and cri aloud to her
hail inkosazanayzulu hail queen of the heaven
now the figur of the gloriou woman held a rod in either hand and the
rod in her right hand wa white and of ivori and the rod in her left
hand wa black and of eboni and as those who came up befor her throne
greet her so she point now with the wand of ivori in her right
hand and now with the wand of eboni in her left hand and with the wand
of ivori she point to the gate of ivori through which came light and
laughter and with the wand of eboni she point to the gate of coal
through which came black and groan and as she point so those
who greet her turn and went some through the gate of light and
some through the gate of black
present as i stood a hand of peopl came up from the bank of the
river i look on them and knew them there wa unandi the mother of
chaka there wa anadi my wife and moosa my son and all my other
wive and children and those who had perish with them
thei stood befor the figur of the woman the princess of the heaven
to whom the umkulunkulu ha given it to watch over the peopl of the
zulu and cri aloud hail inkosazanayzulu hail
then she the inkosazana point with the rod of ivori to the gate of
ivori but still thei stood befor her not move now the woman spoke
for the first time in a low voic that wa sad and aw to hear
pass in children of my peopl pass in to the judgment why tarri ye
pass in through the gate of light
but still thei tarri and in my vision unandi spoke we tarri queen
of the heavensw tarri to prai for justic on him who murder us

mad i do not know but it is true that i seem to see them
i woke when the sky wa grei with the morn light it wa the pain of
my burnt hand that arous me from my sleep or from my stupor i rose
shake the ash from me and went without the kraal to wash awai their
defil then i return and sat outsid the gate of the emposeni

chapter xii the tale of galazi the wolf
now my father i will go back a littl for my tale is long and wind
in and out like a river in a plain and tell of the fate of umslopogaa
when the lion had taken him as he told it to me in the after year
the lioness bound awai and in her mouth wa umslopogaa onc he
struggl but she bit him hard so he lai quiet in her mouth and
look back he saw the face of nada as she ran from the fenc of
thorn cry save him he saw her face he heard her word then he
saw and heard littl more for the world grew dark to him and he pass
as it were into a deep sleep present umslopogaa awok again
feel pain in hi thigh where the lioness had bitten him and heard a
sound of shout he look up near to him stood the lioness that had
loos him from her jaw she wa snort with rage and in front of
her wa a lad long and strong with a grim face and a wolf hide
black and grei bound about hi shoulder in such fashion that the
upper jar and teeth of the wolf rest on hi head he stood befor the
lioness shout and in on hand he held a larg warshield and in
the other he grasp a heavi club shod with iron
now the lioness crouch herself to spring growl terribl but the
lad with the club did not wait for her onset he ran in upon her and
struck her on the head with the club he smote hard and well but thi
did not kill her for she rear herself upon her hind leg and struck
at him heavili he caught the blow upon hi shield but the shield wa
driven against hi breast so strongli that he fell backward beneath it
and lai there howl like a wolf in pain then the lioness sprang upon
him and worri him still becaus of the shield as yet she could not
come at him to slai him but umslopogaa saw that thi might not endur
for present the shield would be torn asid and the stranger must
be kill now in the breast of the lioness still stood the half of
umslopogaass broken spear and it blade wa a span deep in her breast
then thi thought came into the mind of umslopogaa that he would drive
the spear home or die so he rose swiftli for strength came back to him
in hi need and ran to where the lioness worri at him who lai beneath
the shield she did not heed him so he flung himself upon hi knee
befor her and seiz the haft of the broken spear drive it deep
into her and wrench it round now she saw umslopogaa and turn
roar and claw at him tear hi breast and arm then as he
lai he heard a mighti howl and behold grei wolv and black
leap upon the lioness and rent and worri her till she fell and wa
torn to piec by them after thi the sens of umslopogaa left him
again and the light went out of hi ey so that he wa as on dead
at length hi mind came back to him and with it hi memori and he
rememb the lioness and look up to find her but he did not find
her and he saw that he lai in a cave upon a bed of grass while all
about him were the skin of beast and at hi side wa a pot fill
with water he put out hi hand and take the pot drank of the water
and then he saw that hi arm wa wast as with sick and that hi
breast wa thick with scar scarc skin over
now while he lai and wonder the mouth of the cave wa darken and

look on me with no like moreov i wish to be a chief myself
even if i live alon so i left the kraal by night and walk on not

now on the third night i came to a littl kraal that stand on the
farther side of the river at the foot of the mountain in front of the
kraal sat a veri old woman bask in the rai of the set sun she
saw me and spoke to me sai young man you ar tall and strong and
swift of foot would you earn a famou weapon a club that destroi all

then the old woman rose and creep on her hand went into the hut

galazi held it up befor the ey of umslopogaa
in truth my father that wa a club for i mopo saw it in after dai
it wa great and knotti black as iron that had been smoke in the fire
and shod with metal that wa worn smooth with smite
i look at it went on galazi and i tell you stranger a great
desir came into my heart to possess it
how is thi club name i ask of the old woman
it is name watcher of the ford she answer and it ha
not watch in vain five men have held that club in war and a
hundredandseventythre have given up their live beneath it stroke
he who held it last slew twenti befor he wa slain himself for thi
fortun goe with the clubthat he who own it shall die hold it
but in a nobl fashion there is but on other weapon to match with
it in zululand and that is the great ax of jikiza the chief of
the peopl of the ax who dwell in the kraal yonder the ancient
hornhaft imbubuzi the groanmak that bring victori were ax
groanmak and club watcher of the ford side by side there ar
no thirti men in zululand who could stand befor them i have said
choos and the ag woman watch me cunningli through her horni ey
she speak truli now said on of those who stood near let the club

still the old woman watch me through her horni ey at length she
rose la la she said the watcher is not for thi on thi is but
a child i must seek me a man i must seek me a man
not so fast old wife i said will you lend me thi club to hold in
my hand while i go to find the bone of your son and to snatch them from

or of the good club either

watcher go seek the bone if you die let the club be lost with you
if you fail bring it back to me but if you win the bone then it is

last hold him aloft among the dead
so on the morrow at dawn i took the club watcher in my hand and a
littl danc shield and made readi to start the old woman bless me
and bade me farewel but the other peopl of the kraal mock sai
a littl man for so big a club bewar littl man lest the ghost

granddaught of the old womanl me asid prai me not to go
for the forest on the ghost mountain had an evil name none dare walk
there sinc it wa certainli full of spirit who howl like wolv i
thank the girl but to the other i said noth onli i ask of the
path to the ghost mountain
now stranger if you have strength come to the mouth of the cave and
look out for the moon is bright
so umslopogaa rose and crept through the narrow mouth of the cave
there abov him a great grei peak tower high into the air shape
like a seat woman her chin rest upon her breast the place where
the cave wa be as it were on the lap of the woman below thi
place the rock slope sharpli and wa cloth with littl bush lower
down yet wa a forest great and dens that stretch to the top of a
cliff and at the foot of the cliff beyond the water of the river lai
the wide plain of zululand
yonder stranger said galazi point with the club watcher of the
ford far awai to the plain beneath yonder is the kraal where the ag
woman dwelt there is a cliff rise from the plain up which i must
climb there is the forest where dwell the amatongo the peopl of the
ghost there on the hither side of the forest run the path to the
cave and here is the cave itself see thi stone ly at the mouth of
the cave it turn thu shut up the entranc holeit turn gentli
though it is so larg a child mai move it for it rest upon a sharp
point of rock onli mark thi the stone must be push too far for
look if it came to here and he point to a mark in the mouth of the
cave then that man need be strong who can draw it back again though i
have done it myself who am not a man full grown but if it pass beyond
thi mark then see it will roll down the neck of the cave like a
pebbl down the neck of a gourd and i think that two men on strive
from within and on drag from without scarc could avail to
push it clear look now i close the stone as is my custom of a night
soand he grasp the rock and swung it round upon it pivot on
which it turn as a door turn thu i leav it and though except
those to whom the secret is know none would guess that a cave wa here
yet it can be roll back again with a push of the hand but enough of
the stone enter again wander and i will go forward with my tale
for it is long and strang
i start from the kraal of the old woman and the peopl of the kraal
follow me to the brink of the river it wa in flood and few had
dare to cross it
ha ha thei cri now your journei is done littl man watch by
the ford you who would win the watcher of the ford beat the water with
the club perhap so it shall grow gentl that your feet mai pass it
i answer noth to their mock onli i bound the shield upon my
shoulder with a string and the bag that i had brought i made fast
about my middl and i held the great club in my teeth by the thong
then i plung into the river and swam twice stranger the current
bore me under and those on the bank shout that i wa lost but i rose
again and in the end i won the farther shore
now those on the bank mock no more thei stood still wonder and
i walk on till i came to the foot of the cliff that cliff is hard to
climb stranger when you ar strong upon your feet i will show you the
path yet i found a wai up it and by middai i came to the forest here
on the edg of the forest i rest awhil and at a littl food that i
had brought with me in the bag for now i must gather up my strength to
meet the ghost if ghost there were then i rose and plung into the
forest the tree were great that grow there stranger and their leav
ar so think that in certain place the light is as that of night when
the moon is young still i wend on often lose my path but from
time to time between the top of the tree i saw the figur of the grei
stone woman who sit on the top of ghost mountain and shape my cours
toward her knee my heart beat as i travel through the forest in
dark and loneli like that of the night and ever i look round
search for the ey of the amatongo but i saw no spirit though at
time great spot snake crept from befor my feet and perhap these
were the amatongo at time also i caught glimps of some grei wolf
as he slunk from tree to tree watch me and alwai high abov my head
the wind sigh in the great bough with a sound like the sigh of
women
still i went on sing to myself as i went that my heart might not
be faint with fear and at length toward the end of the second hour
the tree grew fewer the ground slope upward and the light pour
down from the heaven again but stranger you ar weari and the night
wear on sleep now and tomorrow i will end the tale sai first how
ar you name
i am name umslopogaa son of mopo he answer and my tale shall
be told when your is done let us sleep
now when galazi heard thi name he start and wa troubl but said
noth so thei laid them down to sleep and galazi wrap umslopogaa
with the skin of buck
but galazi the wolf wa so hardi that he lai on the bare ground and had
no cover so thei slept and without the door of the cave the wolv
howl scent the blood of men
chapter xiii galazi becom king of the wolv
on the morrow umslopogaa awok and knew that strength wa grow on
him fast still all that dai he rest in the cave while galazi
went out to hunt in the even he return bear a buck upon hi
shoulder and thei skin the buck and at of it as thei sat by the
fire and when the sun wa down galazi took up hi tale
now umslopogaa son of mopo hear i had pass the forest and had
come as it were to the leg of the old stone witch who sit up aloft
there forev wait for the world to die here the sun shone merrili
here lizard ran and bird flew to and fro and though it grew toward
the eveningfor i had wander long in the foresti wa afraid no
more so i climb up the steep rock where littl bush grow like
hair on the arm of a man till at last i came to the knee of the stone
witch which ar the space befor the cave i lift by head over the
brink of the rock and look and i tell you umslopogaa my blood ran
cold and my heart turn to water for there befor the cave roll
wolv mani and great some slept and growl in their sleep some
gnaw at the skull of dead game some sat up like dog and their
tongu hung from their grin jaw i look i saw and beyond i
discov the mouth of the cave where the bone of the boi should be
but i had no wish to come there be afraid of the wolv for now
i knew that these were the ghost who live upon the mountain so i
bethought me that i would fly and turn to go and umslopogaa even
as i turn the great club watcher of the ford swung round and smote
me on the back with such a blow as a man smite upon a coward now
whether thi wa by chanc or whether the watcher would shame him who
bore it sai you for i do not know at the least shame enter into
me should i go back to be mock by the peopl of the kraal and by the
old woman and if i wish to go should i not be kill by the ghost
at night in the forest nai it wa better to die in the jaw of the
wolv and at onc
thu i thought in my heart then tarri not lest fear should come
upon me again i swung up the watcher and cry aloud the warcri of
the halakazi i sprang over the brink of the rock and rush upon the
wolv thei too sprang up and stood howl with bristl hide and
fieri ey and the smell of them came into my nostril yet when thei
saw it wa a man that rush upon them thei were seiz with sudden
fear and fled thi wai and that leap by great bound from the place
of rock which is the knee of the stone witch so that present i
stood alon in front of the cave now have conquer the wolf ghost
and no blow struck my heart swell within me and i walk to the
mouth of the cave proudli as a cock walk upon a roof and look in
through the open as it chanc the sink sun shone at thi hour
full into the cave so that all it dark wa made red with light
then onc more umslopogaa i grew afraid inde for i could see the
end of the cave
look now there is a hole in the wall of the cave where the firelight
fall below the shadow of the roof twice the height of a man from the
floor it is a narrow hole and a high is it nota though on had cut
it with iron and a man might sit in it hi leg hang toward the
floor of the cave ay umslopogaa a man might sit in it might he not
and there a man sat or that which had been a man there sat the bone
of a man and the black skin had wither on hi bone hold them
togeth and make him aw to see hi hand were open besid him
he lean upon them and in the right hand wa a piec of hide from hi
moocha it wa half eaten umslopogaa he had eaten it befor he di
hi ey also were bound round with a band of leather as though to hide
someth from their gaze on foot wa gone on hung over the edg of
the nich toward the floor and beneath it on the floor red with rust
lai the blade of a broken spear
now come hither umslopogaa place your hand upon the wall of the
cave just here it is smooth is it notsmooth as the stone on which
women grind their corn what made it so smooth you ask i will tell
you
when i peer through the door of the cave i saw thi on the floor of
the cave lai a shewolf pant as though she had gallop mani a
mile she wa great and fierc near to her wa anoth wolfh wa
a dogold and black bigger than ani i have seen a veri father of
wolv and all hi head and flank were streak with grei but thi
wolf wa on hi feet as i watch he drew back nearli to the mouth of
the cave then of a sudden he ran forward and bound high into the air
toward the wither foot of that which hung from the cleft of the rock
hi pad struck upon the rock here where it is smooth and there for a
second he seem to cling while hi great jaw close with a clash but
a spear breadth beneath the dead man foot then he fell back with
a howl of rage and drew slowli down the cave again he ran and leap
again the great jaw close again he fell down howl then the
shewolf rose and thei sprang togeth strive to pull down him who
sat abov but it wa all in vain thei could never come nearer than
within a spear breadth of the dead man foot and now umslopogaa
you know why the rock is smooth and shine from month to month and year
to year the wolv had raven there seek to devour the bone of him
who sat abov night upon night thei had leap thu against the wall of
the cave but never might their clash jaw close upon hi foot on
foot thei had inde but the other thei could not come by
now as i watch fill with fear and wonder the shewolf her tongu
loll from her jaw made so mighti a bound that she almost reach
the hang foot and yet not quit she fell back and then i saw that
the leap wa her last for that time for she had oversprung herself and
lai there howl the black blood flow from her mouth the wolf saw
also he drew near snif at her then know that she wa hurt
seiz her by the throat and worri her now all the place wa fill
with groan and choke howl as the wolv roll over and over
beneath him who sat abov and in the bloodr light of the dy sun
the sight and sound were so horrid that i trembl like a child
the shewolf grew faint for the fang of her mate were buri in her
throat then i saw that now wa the time to smite him lest when he had
kill her he should kill me also so i lift the watcher and sprang
into the cave have it in my mind to slai the wolf befor he lift up
hi head but he heard my footstep or perhap my shadow fell upon him
loos hi grip he look up thi father of wolv then make no
sound he sprang straight at my throat
i saw him and whirl the watcher aloft i smote with all my
strength the blow met him in midair it fell full on hi chest and
struck him backward to the earth but there he would not sai for
rise befor i could smite again onc more he sprang at me thi time
i leap asid and struck downward and the blow fell upon hi right
leg and broke it so that he could spring no more yet he ran at me on
three feet and though the club fell on hi side he seiz me with hi
teeth bite through that leather bag which wa wound about my middl
into the flesh behind then i yell with pain and rage and lift the
watcher endwai drove it down with both hand as a man drive a stake
into the earth and that with so great a stroke that the skull of the
wolf wa shatter like a pot and he fell dead drag me with him
present i sat up on the ground and place the handl of the watcher
between hi jaw i forc them open free my flesh from the grip
of hi teeth then i look at my wound thei were not deep for the
leather bag had save me yet i feel them to thi hour for there is
poison in the mouth of a wolf present i glanc up and saw that the
shewolf had found her feet again and stood as though unhurt for thi
is the natur of these ghost umslopogaa that though thei fight
continu thei cannot destroi each other thei mai be kill by man
alon and that hardli there she stood and yet she did not look at me
or on her dead mate but at him who sat abov i saw and crept softli
behind her then lift the watcher i dash him down with all my
strength the blow fell on her neck and broke it so that she roll
over and at onc wa dead
now i rest awhil then went to the mouth of the cave and look
out the sun wa sink all the depth of the forest wa black but the
light still shone on the face of the stone woman who sit forev on the
mountain here then i must bide thi night for though the moon shone
white and full in the sky i dare not wend toward the plain alon
with the wolv and the ghost and if i dare not go alon how much
less should i dare to go bear with me him who sat in the cleft of
the rock nai here i must bide so i went out of the cave to the spring
which flow from the rock on the right yonder and wash my wound and
drank then i came back and sat in the mouth of the cave and watch
the light die awai from the face of the world while it wa dy there
wa silenc but when it wa dead the forest awok a wind sprang up
and toss it till the green of it bough wave like troubl water on
which the moon shine faintli from the heart of it too came howl
of ghost and wolv that were answer by howl from the rock
abovehearken umslopogaa such howl as we hear tonight
it wa aw here in the mouth of the cave for i had not yet learn
the secret of the stone and if i had known it should i have dare to
close it leav myself alon with the dead wolv and him whom
the wolv had struggl to tear down i walk out yonder on to the
platform and look up the moon shone full upon the face of the stone
witch who sit aloft forev she seem to grin at me and oh i grew
afraid for now i knew that thi wa a place of dead men a place where
spirit perch like vultur in a tree as thei sweep round and round
the world i went back to the cave and feel that i must do someth
lest i should go mad i drew to me the carcas of the great dogwolf
which i had kill and take my knife of iron i began to skin it by
the light of the moon for an hour or more i skin sing to myself
as i work and strive to forget him who sat in the cleft abov and
the howl which ran about the mountain but ever the moonlight shone
more clearli into the cave now by it i could see hi shape of bone and
skin ay and even the bandag about hi ey why had he ti it there
i wonderedperhap to hide the face of the fierc wolv as thei
sprang upward to grip him and alwai the howl drew nearer now
i could see grei form creep to and fro in the shadow of the rocki
place befor me ah there befor me glare two red ey a sharp
snout snif at the carcas which i skin with a yell i lift the
watcher and smote there came a scream of pain and someth gallop
awai into the shadow
now the skin wa off i cast it behind me and seiz the carcas
drag it to the edg of the rock and left it present the sound of
howl drew near again and i saw the grei shape creep up on by on
now thei gather round the carcas now thei fell upon it and rent it
fight horribl till all wa finish then lick their red chop
thei slunk back to the forest
did i sleep or did i wake nai i cannot tell but i know thi that
of a sudden i seem to look up and see i saw a lightperch
umslopogaa it wa the light of the moon shine upon him that sat
aloft at the end of the cave it wa a red light and he glow in it
as glow a thing that is rotten i look or seem to look and then
i thought that the hang jaw move and from it came a voic that wa
harsh and hollow as of on who speak from an empti belli through a
wither throat
hail galazi child of siguyana said the voic galazi the wolf
sai what dost thou here in the ghost mountain where the stone witch
sit forev wait for the world to die

mist but the grei light glint upon the face of her who sit in stone
abov now i rememb the dream that i had dream and i would see
if it were all a dream so i rose and leav the cave found a place
where i might climb up to the breast and head of the stone witch i

piledup rock for thi umslopogaa is the wai of witch be thei of
stone or fleshwhen you draw near to them thei chang their shape
now i wa on the breast of the mountain and wander to and for awhil
between the great heap of stone at length i found as it were a crack
in the stone thrice as wide as a man can jump and in length half a
spear throw and near thi crack stood great stone blacken by fire
and beneath them broken pot and a knife of flint i look down into
the crackit wa veri deep and green with moss and tall fern grew

club struck on someth that wa yellow and round like a stone and
from the yellow thing came a hollow sound i lift it umslopogaa it
wa the skull of a child
i dug deeper and scrape awai more moss till present i saw beneath
the moss wa noth but the bone of menold bone that had lain there
mani year the littl on had rot the larger on remainedsom
were yellow some black and other still white thei were not broken
as ar those that hyena and wolv have worri yet on some of them
i could see the mark of teeth then umslopogaa i went back to the
cave never look behind me

also when i had finish the sun wa up and i knew that it wa time to
go but i could not go aloneh who sat aloft in the cleft of the cave
must go with me i greatli fear to touch himthi dead on who had
spoken to me in a dream yet i must do it so i brought stone and pile
them up till i could reach him then i lift him down for he wa veri
light be but skin and bone when he wa down i bound the hide of
the wolv about me then leav the leather bag into which he could
not enter i took the dead on and place him on my shoulder as a man
might carri a child for hi leg were fix somewhat apart and hold
him by the foot which wa left on him i set out for the kraal down the
slope i went as swiftli as i could for now i knew the wai see and
hear noth except onc when there came a rush of wing and a
great eagl swept down at that which sat upon my shoulder i shout
and the eagl flew awai then i enter the dark of the forest here i
must walk softli lest the head of him i carri should strike against
the bough and be smitten from him
for awhil i went on thu till i drew near to the heart of the forest
then i heard a wolf howl on my right and from the left came answer
howl and these again were answer by other in front of and behind
me i walk on boldli for i dare not stai guid myself by the sun
which from time to time shone down on me redli through the bough of the
great tree now i could see form grei and black slink near my path
snif at the air as thei went and now i came to a littl open place
and behold all the wolv in the world were gather togeth there
my heart melt my leg trembl beneath me on everi side were the
brute great and hungri and i stood still with club aloft and slowli
thei crept up mutter and growl as thei came till thei form a
deep circl round me yet thei did not spring on me onli drew nearer
and ever nearer present on sprang inde but not at me he sprang
at that which sat upon my shoulder i move asid and he miss hi
aim and come to the ground again stood there growl and whine
like a beast afraid then i rememb the word of my dream if dream
it were how that the dead on had given me wisdom that i should be king
of the ghostwolvesi and anoth whom a lion should bear to me wa it
not so if it wa not so how came it that the wolv did not devour me
for a moment i stood think then i lift up my voic and howl
like a wolf and lo umslopogaa all the wolv howl in answer with a
mighti howl i stretch out my hand and call to them thei ran to
me gather round me as though to devour me but thei did not harm me
thei lick my leg with their red tongu and fight to come near
me press themselv against me as doe a cat on inde snatch
at him who sat on my shoulder but i struck him with the watcher and he
slunk back like a whip hound moreov the other bit him so that
he yell now i knew that i had no more to fear for i wa king of the
ghostwolv so i walk on and with me came all the great pack of
them i walk on and on and thei trot besid me silent and the
fallen leav crackl beneath their feet and the dust rose up about
them till at length i reach the edg of the forest
now i rememb that i must not be seen thu by men lest thei should
think me a wizard and kill me therefor at the edg of the forest
i halt and made sign to the wolv to go back at thi thei howl
piteous as though in grief but i call to them that i would come
again and be their king and it seem as though their brute heart
understood my word then thei all went still howl till present i
wa alon

the patter of their feet and thei came round me by ten and by
twenti and fawn upon me i count their number thei number

them that thei do stai umslopogaa now you ar strong again and if

els befor a man could count hi finger twice there would be littl
enough left of you bind it about the neck and beneath the arm and see
that the fasten do not burst lest it be the wors for you
so umslopogaa took the grei wolf hide and bound it on with thong of
leather and it teeth gleam upon hi head and he took a spear in hi
hand galazi also bound on the hide of the king of the wolv and thei
went out on to the space befor the cave galazi stood there awhil and
the moonlight fell upon him and umslopogaa saw that hi face grew wild
and beastlik that hi ey shone and hi teeth grin beneath hi
curl lip he lift up hi head and howl out upon the night
thrice galazi lift hi head and thrice he howl loudli and yet more
loud but befor ever the echo had di in the air from the height
of the rock abov and the depth of the forest beneath there came
howl in answer nearer thei grew and nearer now there wa a sound
of feet and a wolf great and grei bound toward them and after him
mani anoth thei came to galazi thei sprang upon him fawn round

umslopogaa and rush at him openmouth
stand and do not move cri galazi be not afraid
i have alwai fondl dog answer umslopogaa shall i learn to
fear them now
yet though he spoke boldli in hi heart he wa afraid for thi wa the
most terribl of all sight the wolv rush on him openmouth from
befor and from behind so that in a breath he wa wellnigh hidden by
their form yet no fang pierc him for as thei leapt thei smelt the
smell of the skin upon him then umslopogaa saw that the wolv leapt
at him no more but the shewolv gather round him who wore the
shewolf skin thei were great and gaunt and hungri all were
fullgrown there were no littl on and their number wa so mani
that he could not count them in the moonlight umslopogaa look into

the pack is gather now for the hunt cri galazi make your feet
swift my brother for we shall journei far tonight ho blackfang ho

he spoke and bound forward and with him went umslopogaa and after
him stream the ghostwolv thei fled down the mountain side
leap from boulder to boulder like buck present thei stood by a
kloof that wa thick with tree galazi stop hold up the watcher
and the wolv stop with him
i smell a quarri he cri in my peopl in
then the wolv plung silent into the great kloof but galazi and
umslopogaa drew to the foot of it and wait present there came a
sound of break bough and lo befor them stood a buffalo a bull
who low fierc and snif the air
thi on will give us a good chase my brother see he is gaunt and
thin ah that meat is tender which my peopl have hunt to the death
as galazi spoke the first of the wolv drew from the covert and saw
the buffalo then give tongu thei sprang toward it the bull
saw also and dash down the hill and after him came galazi and
umslopogaa and with them all their compani and the rock shook with
the music of their hunt thei rush down the mountain side and
it came into the heart of umslopogaa that he too wa a wolf thei
rush madli yet hi feet were swift as the swiftest no wolf could
outstrip him and in him wa but on desireth desir of prei now
thei near the border of the forest and galazi shout he shout
to greysnout and to blackfang to blood and to deathgrip and these
four leap forward from the pack run so swiftli that their belli
seem to touch the ground thei pass about the bull turn him from
the forest and set hi head up the slope of the mountain then the
chase wheel the bull leap and bound up the mountain side and
on on flank lai greysnout and deathgrip and on the other lai blood
and blackfang while behind came the wolfbrethren and after them the
wolv with loll tongu up the hill thei sped but the feet of
umslopogaa never weari hi breath did not fail him onc more thei
drew near the lap of the grei witch where the cave wa on rush the
bull mad with fear he ran so swiftli that the wolv were left behind
sinc here for a space the ground wa level to hi feet galazi look
on umslopogaa at hi side and grin
you do not run so ill my brother who have been sick of late see now
if you can outrun me who shall touch the quarri first
now the bull wa ahead by two spearthrow umslopogaa look and
grin back at galazi good he cri awai
thei sped forward with a bound and for awhil it seem to umslopogaa
as though thei stood side by side onli the bull grew nearer and nearer
then he put out hi strength and the swift of hi feet and lo when
he look again he wa alon and the bull wa veri near never were
feet so swift as those of umslopogaa now he reach the bull as he
labour on umslopogaa place hi hand upon the back of the bull and
leap he wa on him he sat him as you white men sit a hors then he
lift the spear in hi hand and drove it down between the shoulder
to the spine and of a sudden the great buffalo stagger stop and
fell dead
galazi came up who now is the swiftest galazi cri umslopogaa
i or you or your wolf host
you ar the swiftest umslopogaa said galazi gasp for hi
breath never did a man run as you run nor ever shall again
now the wolv stream up and would have torn the carcas but galazi
beat them back and thei rest awhil then galazi said let us cut
meat from the bull with a spear
so thei cut meat from the bull and when thei had finish galazi
motion to the wolv and thei fell upon the carcas fight
furious in a littl while noth wa left except the larger bone
and yet each wolf had but a littl
then thei went back to the cave and slept
afterward umslopogaa told galazi all hi tale and galazi ask him if
he would abid with him and be hi brother and rule with him over the
wolfkind or seek hi father mopo at the kraal of chaka
umslopogaa said that it wa rather in hi mind to seek hi sister nada
for he wa weari of the kraal of chaka but he thought of nada dai and
night
where then is nada your sister ask galazi
she sleep in the cave of your peopl galazi she tarri with the
halakazi
stai awhil umslopogaa cri galazi stai till we ar men inde
then we will seek thi sister of your and snatch her from the cave of
the halakazi
now the desir of thi wolflif had enter into the heart of
umslopogaa and he said that it should be so and on the morrow thei
made them bloodbrethren to be on till death befor all the compani
of ghostwolv and the wolv howl when thei smelt the blood of men
in all thing thenceforth these two were equal and the ghostwolv
hearken to the voic of both of them and on mani a moonlight night
thei and the wolv hunt togeth win their food at time thei
cross the river hunt in the plain for game wa scarc on the
mountain and the peopl of the kraal would come out hear the mighti
howl and watch the pack sweep across the veldt and with them a man
or men then thei would sai that the ghost were abroad and creep into
their hut shiver with fear but as yet the wolfbrethren and their
pack kill no men but game onli or at time eleph and lion
now when umslopogaa had abod some moon in the witch mountain on a
night he dream of nada and awaken soft at heart bethought himself
that he would learn tide concern me hi father mopo and what
had befallen me and her whom he deem hi mother and nada hi sister
and hi other brethren so he cloth himself hide hi naked
and leav galazi descend to that kraal where the old woman had
dwelt and there gave it out that he wa a young man a chief son from
a far place who sought a wife the peopl of the kraal listen to him
though thei held that hi look wa fierc and wild and on ask if
thi were galazi the wolf galazi the wizard but anoth answer that
thi wa not galazi for their ey had seen him umslopogaa said that
he knew noth of galazi and littl of wolv and lo while he spoke
there came an impi of fifti men and enter the kraal umslopogaa
look at the leader of the impi and knew them for captain of chaka
at first he would have spoken to them but hi ehlos bade him hold hi
peac so he sat in a corner of the big hut and listen present the
headman of the kraal who trembl with fear for he believ that
the impi had been sent to destroi him and all that were hi ask the
captain what wa hi will
a littl matter and a vain said the captain we ar sent by the
king to search for a certain youth umslopogaa the son of mopo the
king doctor mopo gave it out that the youth wa kill by a lion near
these mountain and chaka would learn if thi is true
we know noth of the youth said the headman but what would ye
with him
onli thi answer the captain to kill him
that is yet to do thought umslopogaa
who is thi mopo ask the headman
an evildo whose hous the king ha eaten upman woman and child
answer the captain
chapter xv the death of the king slayer
when umslopogaa heard these word hi heart wa heavi and a great
anger burn in hi breast for he thought that i mopo wa dead with
the rest of hi hous and he love me but he said noth onli
watch till none were look he slip past the back of the
captain and won the door of the hut soon he wa clear of the kraal
and run swiftli cross the river and came to the ghost mountain
meanwhil the captain ask the headman of the kraal if he knew
anyth of such a youth as him for whom thei sought the headman told
the captain of galazi the wolf but the captain said that thi could not
be the lad for galazi had dwelt mani moon upon the ghost mountain
there is anoth youth said the headman a stranger fierc strong
and tall with ey that shine like spear he is in the hut now he
sit yonder in the shadow
the captain rose and look into the shadow but umslopogaa wa gone
now thi youth is fled said the headman and yet none saw him fly
perhap he also is a wizard inde i have heard that now there ar two
of them upon the ghost mountain and that thei hunt there at night with
the ghostwolv but i do not know if it is true
now i am mind to kill you said the captain in wrath becaus you
have suffer thi youth to escap me without doubt it is umslopogaa
son of mopo
it is no fault of mine said the headmen these young men ar
wizard who can pass hither and thither at will but i sai thi to you
captain of the king if you will go on the ghost mountain you must go
there alon with your soldier for none in these part dare to tread
upon that mountain
yet i shall dare tomorrow said the captain we grow brave at the
kraal of chaka there men do not fear spear or ghost or wild beast or
magic but thei fear the king word alon the sun setsgiv us food
tomorrow we will search the mountain
thu my father did thi captain speak in hi follyh who should
never see anoth sun
now umslopogaa reach the mountain and when he had pass the
forestof which he had learn everi secret wayth dark gather
and the wolv awok in the dark and drew near howl umslopogaa
howl in answer and present that great wolf deathgrip came to him
umslopogaa saw him and call him by hi name but behold the brute
did not know him and flew at him growl then umslopogaa rememb
that the shewolf skin wa not bound about hi shoulder and
therefor it wa that the wolf deathgrip knew him not for though in
the daytim when the wolv slept he might pass to and fro without the
skin at night it wa not so he had not brought the skin becaus he
dare not wear it in the sight of the men of the kraal lest thei should
know him for on of the wolfbrethren and it had not been hi plan
to seek the mountain again that night but rather on the morrow
now umslopogaa knew that hi danger wa great inde he beat back
deathgrip with hi kerri but other were behind him for the wolv
gather fast then he bound awai toward the cave for he wa so
swift of foot that the wolv could not catch him though thei press
him hard and onc the teeth of on of them tore hi moocha never
befor did he run so fast and in the end he reach the cave and roll
the rock to and as he did so the wolv dash themselv against it
then he clad himself in the hide of the shewolf and push asid the
stone came out and lo the ey of the wolv were open and thei
knew him for on of the brethren who rule over them and slunk awai at
hi bid
now umslopogaa sat himself down at the mouth of the cave wait
for galazi and he thought present galazi came and in few word
umslopogaa told him all hi tale
you have run a great risk my brother said galazi what now
thi said umslopogaa these peopl of our ar hungri for the flesh
of men let us feed them full on the soldier of chaka who sit yonder
at the kraal seek my life i would take vengeanc for mopo my
father and all my brethren who ar dead and for my mother the wive
of mopo what sai you
galazi laugh aloud that will be merri my brother he said i
weari of hunt beast let us hunt men tonight
ay tonight said umslopogaa nod i long to look upon that
captain as a maid long for her lover kiss but first let us rest and
eat for the night is young then galazi summon our impi
so thei rest and at and afterward went out arm and galazi howl
to the wolv and thei came in ten and twenti till all were gather
togeth galazi move among them shake the watcher as thei sat upon
their haunch and follow him with their fieri ey
we do not hunt game tonight littl peopl he cri but men and
you love the flesh of men
now all the wolv howl as though thei understood then the pack
divid itself as wa it custom the shewolv follow umslopogaa
the dogwolv follow galazi and in silenc thei move swiftli down
toward the plain thei came to the river and swam it and there eight
spear throw awai on the farther side of the river stood the kraal
now the wolfbrethren took counsel togeth and galazi with the
dogwolv went to the north gate and umslopogaa with the shewolv
to the south gate thei reach them safe and in silenc for at the
bid of the brethren the wolv ceas from their howl the gate
were stop with thorn but the brethren pull out the thorn and
made a passag as thei did thi it chanc that certain dog in the
kraal heard the sound of the stir bough and awaken caught the
smell of the wolv that were with umslopogaa for the wind blew from
that quarter these dog ran out bark and present thei came to the
south gate of the kraal and flew at umslopogaa who pull awai the
thorn now when the wolv saw the dog thei could be restrain no
longer but sprang on them and tore them to fragment and the sound
of their worri came to the ear of the soldier of chaka and of the
dweller in the kraal so that thei sprang from sleep snatch their
arm and as thei came out of the hut thei saw in the moonlight a man
wear a wolf hide rush across the empti cattl kraal for the
grass wa long and the cattl were out at graze and with him countless
wolv black and grei then thei cri aloud in terror sai that the
ghost were on them and turn to flee to the north gate of the kraal
but behold here also thei met a man clad in a wolf skin onli and
with him countless wolv black and grei
now some flung themselv to earth scream in their fear and some
strove to run awai but the greater part of the soldier and with them
mani of the men of the kraal came togeth in knot be mind to
die like men at teeth of the ghost and that though thei shook with
fear then umslopogaa howl aloud and howl galazi and thei flung
themselv upon the soldier and the peopl of the kraal and with them
came the wolv then a cry and a bai rose up to heaven as the
grei wolv leap and bit and tore littl thei heed the spear and
kerri of the soldier some were kill but the rest did not stai
present the knot of men broke up and to each man wolv hung by two
and three drag him to earth some few fled inde but the wolv
hunt them by gaze and scent and pull them down befor thei pass
the gate of the kraal
the wolfbrethren also raven with the rest busi wa the watcher and
mani bow beneath him and often the spear of umslopogaa flash in
the moonlight it wa finish none were left live in that kraal and
the wolv growl sullenli as thei took their fill thei who had been

joi becaus thei had slaughter those who were sent out to slaughter
thei call to the wolv bid them search the hut and the wolv
enter the hut as dog enter a thicket and kill those who lurk
there or drove them forth to be slain without present a man great
and tall sprang from the last of the hut where he had hidden himself
and the wolv outsid rush on him to drag him down but umslopogaa
beat them back for he had seen the face of the man it wa that captain
whom chaka had sent out to kill him he beat them back and stalk up
to the captain sai greet to you captain of the king now
tell us what is your errand here beneath the shadow of her who sit
in stone and he point with hi spear to the grei witch on the ghost

more with the spear but with the ax alon it wa to seek an ax that
i ran to and fro like a coward but thi is a poor thing see the
haft is split becaus of the great of my stroke now thi is my
desireto win that great ax of jikiza which is call groanmak of
which we have heard tell so that ax and club mai stand togeth in the
frai
that must be for anoth night said galazi we have not done so
ill for onc now let us search for pot and corn of which we stand in
need and then to the mountain befor dawn find us
thu then did the wolfbrethren bring death on the impi of chaka and
thi wa but the first of mani death that thei wrought with the help
of the wolv for ever thei raven through the land at night and
fall on those thei hate thei at them up till their name and the
name of the ghostwolv becam terribl in the ear of men and the
land wa swept clean but thei found that the wolv would not go abroad
to worri everywher thu on a certain night thei set out to fall upon
the kraal of the peopl of the ax where dwelt the chief jikiza who
wa name the unconqu and own the ax groanmak but when thei
near the kraal the wolv turn back and fled then galazi rememb
the dream that he had dream in which the dead on in the cave had
seem to speak tell him that there onli where the meneat had
hunt in the past might the wolv hunt todai so thei return home
but umslopogaa set himself to find a plan to win the ax
chapter xvi umslopogaa ventur out to win the ax
now mani moon had gone by sinc umslopogaa becam a king of the
wolv and he wa a man full grown a man fierc and tall and keen a
slayer of men fleet of foot and of valour unequal see by night
as well as by dai but he wa not yet name the slaughter and not
yet did he hold that iron chieftai the ax groanmak still the
desir to win the ax wa foremost in hi mind for no woman had enter
there who when she enter drive out all other desireai my father
even that of good weapon at time inde umslopogaa would lurk in
the reed by the river look at the kraal of jikiza the unconqu
and would watch the gate of hi kraal and onc as he lurk he saw a
man great broad and hairi who bore upon hi shoulder a shine ax
haft with the horn of a rhinocero after that hi greed for thi ax
enter into umslopogaa more and more till at length he scarc
could sleep for think of it and to galazi he spoke of littl els
weari him much with hi talk for galazi love silenc but for all
hi long he could find no mean to win it
now it befel that as umslopogaa hid on even in the reed watch
the kraal of jikiza he saw a maiden straight and fair whose skin shone
like the copper anklet on her limb she walk slowli toward the
reed where he lai hidden nor did she top at the brink of the reed
she enter them and sat herself down within a spear length of where
umslopogaa wa seat and at onc began to weep speak to herself
as she wept
would that the ghostwolv might fall on him and all that is hi she
sob ay and on masilo also i would hound them on even if i myself
must next know their fang better to die by the teeth of the wolv
than to be sold to thi fat pig of a masilo oh if i must wed him i
will give him a knife for the bride kiss oh that i were a ladi of
the ghostwolv there should be a pick of bone in the kraal of
jikiza befor the moon grow young again
umslopogaa heard and of a sudden rear himself up befor the maid
and he wa great and wild to look on and the shewolf fang shone
upon hi brow
the ghostwolv ar at hand damsel he said thei ar ever at hand
for those who need them
now the maid saw him and scream faintli then grew silent wonder
at the great and the fierc ey of the man who spoke to her
who ar you she ask i fear you not whoever you ar
there you ar wrong damsel for all men fear me and thei have caus
to fear i am on of the wolfbrethren whose name have been told of
i am a wizard of the ghost mountain take heed now lest i kill you
it will be of littl avail to call upon your peopl for my feet ar
fleeter than their
i have no wish to call upon my peopl wolfman she answer and
for the rest i am too young to kill
that is so maiden answer umslopogaa look at her beauti what
were the word upon your lip as to jikiza and a certain masilo were
thei not fierc word such as my heart like well
it seem that you heard them answer the girl what need to wast
breath in speak them again
no need maiden now tell me your stori perhap i mai find a wai to
help you
there is littl to tell she answer it is a small tale and a
common my name is zinita and jikiza the unconqu is my stepfath
he marri my mother who is dead but none of hi blood is in me now
he would give me in marriag to a certain masilo a fat man and an old
whom i hate becaus masilo offer mani cattl for me
is there then anoth whom you would wed maiden ask umslopogaa
there is none answer zinita look him in the ey
and is there no path by which you mai escap from masilo
there is onli on path wolfmanbi death if i die i shall escap
if masilo di i shall escap but to littl end for i shall be given
to anoth but if jikiza di then it will be well what of that
wolfpeopl of your ar thei not hungri wolfman
i cannot bring them here answer umslopogaa is there no other
wai
there is anoth wai said zinita if on can be found to try it
and again she look at him strang caus the blood to beat within
him hearken do you not know how our peopl ar govern thei ar
govern by him who hold the ax groanmak he that can win the ax
in war from the hand of him who hold it shall be our chief but if
he who hold the ax di unconqu then hi son take hi place and
with it the ax it ha been thu inde for four gener sinc
he who held groanmak ha alwai been unconquer but i have heard
that the greatgrandfath of jikiza won the ax from him who held it
in hi dai he won it by fraud for when the ax had fallen on him
but lightli he fell over feign death then the owner of the ax
laugh and turn to walk awai but the forefath of jikiza sprang
up behind him and pierc him through with a spear and thu he becam
chief of the peopl of the ax therefor it is the custom of jikiza to
hew off the head of those whom he kill with the ax
doe he then slai mani ask umslopogaa
of late year few inde she said for none dare stand against
himno not with all to win for hold the ax groanmak he is
unconquer and to fight with him is sure death fiftyandon have
tri in all and befor the hut of jikiza there ar pile fiftyandon
white skull and know thi the ax must be won in fight if it is
stolen or found it ha no virtuenai it bring shame and death to him
who hold it
how then mai a man give battl to jikiza he ask again
thu onc in everi year on the first dai of the new moon of the
summer season jikiza hold a meet of the headmen then he must rise
and challeng all or ani to come forward and do battl with him to win
the ax and becom chief in hi place now if on come forward thei go
into the cattl kraal and there the matter is end afterward when
the head is hewn from hi foe jikiza goe back to the meet of the
headmen and thei talk as befor all ar free to come to the meet
and jikiza must fight with them if thei wish it whoever thei be
perhap i shall be there said umslopogaa
after thi meet at the new moon i am to be given in marriag to
masilo said the maid but should on conquer jikiza then he will be
chief and can give me in marriag to whom he will
now umslopogaa understood her mean and knew that he had found
favour in her sight and the thought move him a littl for women were
strang to him as yet
if perchanc i should be there he said and if perchanc i should
win the iron chieftai the ax groanmak and rule over the
peopl of the ax you should not live far from the shadow of the ax
thenceforward maid zinita
it is well wolfman though some might not wish to dwell in that
shadow but first you must win the ax mani have tri and all have
fail
yet on must succe at last he said and so farewel and he
leap into the torrent of the river and swam it with great stroke
now the maid zinita watch him till he wa gone and love of him
enter into her hearta love that wa fierc and jealou and strong
but as he wend to the ghost mountain umslopogaa thought rather of ax
groanmak than of maid zinita for ever at the bottom umslopogaa
love war more than women though thi ha been hi fate that women
have brought sorrow on hi head
fifteen dai must pass befor the dai of the new moon and dure thi
time umslopogaa thought much and said littl still he told galazi
someth of the tale and that he wa determin to do battl with
jikiza the unconqu for the ax groanmak galazi said that he
would do well to let it be and that it wa better to stai with the
wolv than to go out seek strang weapon he said also that even
if he won the ax the matter might not stai there for he must take the
girl also and hi heart bode no good of women it had been a girl
who poison hi father in the kraal of the halakazi to all of which
umslopogaa answer noth for hi heart wa set both on the ax and
the girl but more on the first than the last
so the time wore on and at length came the dai of the new moon at the
dawn of that dai umslopogaa aros and clad himself in a moocha bind
the shewolf skin round hi middl beneath the moocha in hi hand
he took a stout fightingshield which he had made of buffalo hide and
that same light moonshap ax with which he had slain the captain of
chaka
a poor weapon with which to kill jikiza the unconquer said
galazi ey it askanc
it shall serv my turn answer umslopogaa
now umslopogaa at and then thei move togeth slowli down the
mountain and cross the river by a ford for he wish to save hi
strength on the farther side of the river galazi hid himself in the
reed becaus hi face wa known and there umslopogaa bade him
farewel not know if he should look upon him again afterward he
walk up to the great place of jikiza now when he reach the gate
of the kraal he saw that mani peopl were stream through them and
mingl with the peopl present thei came to the open space in front
of the hut of jikiza and there the headmen were gather togeth in
the centr of them and befor a heap of the skull of men which were
pile up against hi doorpost sat jikiza a huge man a hairi and a
proud who glare about him roll hi ey fasten to hi arm by a
thong of leather wa the great ax groanmak and each man as he came
up salut the ax call it inkosikaa or chieftai but he did
not salut jikiza umslopogaa sat down with the peopl in front of the
councillor and few took ani notic of him except zinita who move
sullenli to and fro bear gourd of beer to the councillor near to
jikiza on hi right hand sat a fat man with small and twinkl ey
who watch the maid zinita greedili
yon man thought umslopogaa is masilo the better for bloodlet
will you be masilo
present jikiza spoke roll hi ey thi is the matter befor
you councillor i have settl it in my mind to give my stepdaught
zinita in marriag to masilo but the marriag gift is not yet agre
on i demand a hundr head of cattl from masilo for the maid is fair
and straight a proper maid and moreov my daughter though not
of my blood but masilo offer fifti head onli therefor i ask you to

we hear you lord of the ax answer on of the councillor but
first o unconqu you must on thi dai of the year accord to
ancient custom give public challeng to ani man to fight you for the
groanmak and for your place as chief of the peopl of the ax
thi is a wearisom thing grumbl jikiza can i never have done in
it fiftyandthre have i slain in my youth without a wound and now
for mani year i have challeng like a cock on a dunghil and none
crow in answer
ho now is there ani man who will come forward and do battl with me
jikiza for the great ax groanmak to him who can win it it shall
be and with it the chieftainship of the peopl of the ax
thu he spoke veri fast as a man gabbl a prayer to a spirit in whom
he ha littl faith then turn onc more to talk of the cattl of
masilo and of the maid zinita but suddenli umslopogaa stood up
look at him over the top of hi war shield and cry here is on
o jikiza who will do battl with you for the ax groanmak and for
the chieftainship that is to him who hold the ax
now all the peopl laugh and jikiza glare at him
come forth from behind that big shield of your he said come out
and tell me your name and lineagey who would do battl with the
unconqu for the ancient ax
then umslopogaa came forward and he look so fierc though he wa
but young that the peopl laugh no more
what is my name and lineag to you jikiza he said let it be and
hasten to do me battl as you must by the custom for i am eager to
handl the groanmak and to sit in your seat and settl thi matter of
the cattl of masilo the pig when i have kill you i will take a name

now onc more the peopl laugh but jikiza grew mad with wrath and
sprang up gasp
what he said you dare to speak thu to me you babe unwean to

ax i tell you all that present i will stand upon hi head and then
we will settl the matter of masilo
babbl not so fast man quoth umslopogaa or if you must babbl
speak those word which you would sai er you bid the sun farewel
now jikiza choke with rage and foam came from hi lip so that he
could not speak but the peopl found thi sportal except masilo who
look askanc at the stranger tall and fierc and zinita who look
at masilo and with no love so thei move down to the cattl kraal and
galazi see it from afar could keep awai no longer but drew near
and mingl with the crowd
chapter xvii umslopogaa becom chief of the peopl of the ax
now when umslopogaa and jikiza the unconqu had come to the cattl
kraal thei were set in it centr and there were ten pace between
them umslopogaa wa arm with the great shield and the light
moonshap ax jikiza carri the groanmak and a small danc
shield and look at the weapon of the two peopl thought that the
stranger would furnish no sport to the holder of the ax
he is illarm said an old man it should be otherwiselarg ax
small shield jikiza is unconquer and the big shield will not help
thi longleg stranger when groanmak rattl on the buffalo hide
the old man spoke thu in the hear of galazi the wolf and galazi
thought that he spoke wise and sorrow for the fate of hi brother
now the word wa given and jikiza rush on umslopogaa roar for
hi rage wa great but umslopogaa did not stir till hi foe wa about
to strike then suddenli he leap asid and as jikiza pass he smote
him hard upon the back with the flat of hi ax make a great sound
for it wa not hi plan to try and kill jikiza with thi ax now
a shout of laughter went up from the hundr of the peopl and the
laughter went up from the hundr of the peopl and the heart of
jikiza nearli burst with rage becaus of the shame of that blow round
he came like a bull that is mad and onc more rush at umslopogaa
who lift hi shield to meet him then of a sudden just when the
great ax leapt on high umslopogaa utter a cry as of fear and
turn fled befor the face of jikiza now onc more the shout of
laughter went up while umslopogaa fled swiftli and after him rush
jikiza blind with furi round and about the kraal sped umslopogaa
scarc a spear length ahead of jikiza and he ran keep hi
back to the sun as much as might be that he might watch the shadow of
jikiza a second time he sped round while the peopl cheer the
chase as hunter cheer a dog which pursu a buck so cunningli did
umslopogaa run that though he seem to reel with weak in such
fashion that men thought hi breath wa gone yet he went ever faster
and faster draw jikiza after him
now when umslopogaa knew by the breath of hi foe and by the
stagger of hi shadow that hi strength wa spent suddenli he made
as though he were about to fall himself and stumbl out of the path
far to the right and as he stumbl he let drop hi great shield full
in the wai of jikiza feet then it came about that jikiza rush
on blindli caught hi feet in the shield and fell headlong to earth
umslopogaa saw and swoop on him like an eagl to a dove befor men
could so much as think he had seiz the ax groanmak and with a
blow of the steel he held had sever the thong of leather which bound
it to the wrist of jikiza and sprung back hold the great ax aloft
and cast down hi own weapon upon the ground now the watcher saw
all the cun of hi fight and those of them who hate jikiza shout
aloud but other were silent
slowli jikiza gather himself from the ground wonder if he were
still aliv and as he rose he grasp the littl ax of umslopogaa
and look at it he wept but umslopogaa held up the great
groanmak the iron chieftai and examin it curv point of
blue steel the goug that stand behind it and the beauti of it haft
bound about with wire of brass and end in a knob like the knob of
a stick as a lover look upon the beauti of hi bride then befor all
men he kiss the broad blade and cri aloud
greet to thee my chieftai greet to thee wife of my youth
whom i have won in war never shall we part thou and i and togeth
will we die thou and i for i am not mind that other should handl
thee when i am gone
thu he cri in the hear of men then turn to jikiza who stood
weep becaus he had lost all
where now is your pride o unconqu laugh umslopogaa fight
on you ar as well arm as i wa a while ago when i did not fear to
stand befor you
jikiza look at him for a moment then with a curs he hurl the
littl ax at him and turn fled swiftli toward the gate of the
cattl kraal
umslopogaa stoop and the littl ax sped over him then he stood for
a while watch and the peopl thought that he meant to let jikiza go
but that wa not hi desir he wait inde until jikiza had cover
nearli half the space between him and the gate then with a roar he
leap forward as light leap from a cloud and so fast did hi feet
fly that the watcher could scarc see them move jikiza fled fast also
yet he seem but as on who stand still now he reach the gate of
the kraal now there wa rush a light of downward fall steel and
someth swept past him then behold jikiza fell in the gatewai of
the cattl kraal and all saw that he wa dead smitten to death by
that mighti ax groanmak which he and hi father had held for mani
year
a great shout went up from the crowd of watcher when thei knew that
jikiza the unconqu wa kill at last and there were mani who
hail umslopogaa name him chief and lord of the peopl of the ax
but the son of jikiza to the number of ten great men and brave rush
on umslopogaa to kill him umslopogaa ran backward lift up the
groanmak when certain councillor of the peopl flung themselv in
between them cry hold
is not thi your law ye councillor said umslopogaa that have
conquer the chief of the peopl of the ax i myself am chief
that is our law inde stranger answer an ag councillor but
thi also is our law that now you must do battl on by on with
all who come against you so it wa in my father time when the
grandfath of him who now li dead won the ax and so it must be
again todai
i have noth to sai against the rule said umslopogaa now who is
there who will come up against me to do battl for the ax groanmak
and the chieftainship of the peopl of the ax
then all the ten son of jikiza step forward as on man for their
heart were made with wrath becaus of the death of their father and
becaus the chieftainship had gone from their race so that in truth
thei care littl if thei live or di but there were none besid
these for all men fear to stand befor umslopogaa and the
groanmak
umslopogaa count them there ar ten by the head of chaka he
cri now if i must fight all these on by on no time will be left
to me thi dai to talk of the matter of masilo and of the maid zinita
hearken what sai you son of jikiza the conquer if i find on other
to stand besid me in the frai and all of you come on at onc against
us twain ten against two to slai us or be slain will that be to your
mind
the brethren consult togeth and held that so thei should be in
better case than if thei went up on by on
so be it thei said and the councillor assent
now as he fled round and round umslopogaa had seen the face of
galazi hi brother in the throng and knew that he hunger to share
the fight so he call aloud that he whom he should choos and who
would stand back to back with him in the frai if victori were their
should be the first after him among the peopl of the ax and as he
call he walk slowli down the line scan the face of all till
he came to where galazi stood lean on the watcher
here is a great fellow who bear a great club said umslopogaa how
ar you name fellow
i am name wolf answer galazi
sai now wolf ar you will to stand back to back with me in thi
frai of two against ten if victori is our you shall be next to me
amongst thi peopl
better i love the wild wood and the mountain breast than the kraal
of men and the kiss of wive axebear answer galazi yet becaus
you have shown yourself a warrior of might and to tast again of the
joi of battl i will stand back to back with you axebear and see
thi matter end
a bargain wolf cri umslopogaa and thei walk side by sidea
mighti pairtil thei came to the centr of the cattl kraal all
there look on them wonder and it came into the thought of some
of them that these were none other than the wolfbrethren who dwelt upon
the ghost mountain
now ax groanmak and club watcher ar come togeth galazi said
umslopogaa as thei walk and i think that few can stand befor
them
some shall find it so answer galazi at the least the frai will
be merri and what matter how frai end
ah said umslopogaa victori is good but death end all and is best
of all
then thei spoke of the fashion in which thei would fight and
umslopogaa look curious at the ax he carri and at the point on
it hammer balanc it in hi hand when he had look long the pair
took their stand back to back in the centr of the kraal and peopl saw
that umslopogaa held the ax in a new fashion it curv blade be
inward toward hi breast and the hollow point turn toward the foe
the ten brethren gather themselv togeth shake their assegai
five of them stood befor umslopogaa and five befor galazi the wolf
thei were all great men made fierc with rage and shame
now noth except witchcraft can save these two said a councillor to
on who stood by him
yet there is virtu in the ax answer the other and for the club
it seem that i know it i think it is name watcher of the ford and
woe to those who stand befor the watcher i myself have seen him aloft
when i wa young moreov these ar no craven who hold the ax and
the club thei ar but lad inde yet thei have drunk wolf milk
meanwhil an ag man drew near to speak the word of onset it wa that
same man who had set out the law to umslopogaa he must give the signal
by throw up a spear and when it struck the ground then the fight
would begin the old man took the spear and threw it but hi hand wa
weak and he cast so clumsili that it fell among the son of jikiza who
stood befor umslopogaa caus them to open up to let it pass between
them and draw the ey of all ten of them to it but umslopogaa
watch for the touch of the spear onli be careless where it
touch as the point of it kiss the earth he said a word and lo
umslopogaa and galazi not wait for the onslaught of the ten as men
had thought thei must sprang forward each at the line of foe who were
befor him while the ten still stood confus for it had been their
plan to attack the wolfbrethren were upon them groanmak wa up
but as for no great stroke he did but peck as a bird peck with hi
bill and yet a man drop dead the watcher also wa up but he fell
like a fall tree and wa the death of on through the line of the
ten pass the wolfbrethren in the gap that each had made then thei
turn swiftli and charg toward each other again again groanmak
peck again the watcher thunder and lo onc more umslopogaa stood
back to back unhurt but befor them lai four men dead
the onslaught and the return were so swift that men scarc understood
what had been done even those of the son of jikiza who were left
stare at each other wonder then thei knew that thei were but six
for four of them were dead with a shout of rage thei rush upon the
pair from both side but in either case on wa the most eager and
outstep the other two and thu it came about that time wa given
the wolfbrethren to strike at him alon befor hi fellow were at hi
side he who came at umslopogaa drove at him with hi spear but he
wa not to be caught thi for he bent hi middl sidewai so that the
spear onli cut hi skin and as he bent tap with the point of the ax
at the head of the smiter deal death on him
yonder woodpeck ha a bill of steel and he can us it well said
the councillor to him who stood by him
thi is a slaughter inde the man answer and the peopl heard
the name thenceforth thei knew umslopogaa as the woodpeck and as
bulalio or the slaughter and by no other name now he who came at
galazi the wolf rush on wildli hold hi spear short but galazi
wa cun in war he took on step forward to meet him then swing
the watcher backward he let him fall at the full length of arm and
club the child of jikiza lift hi shield to catch the blow but the
shield wa to the watcher what a leaf is to the wind full on it hide
the huge club fell make a loud sound the warshield doubl up like
a raw skin and he who bore it fell crush to the earth
now for a moment the four who were left of the son of jikiza hover
round the pair feint at them from afar but never come within
reach of ax or club on threw a spear inde and though umslopogaa
leap asid and as it sped toward him smote the haft in two with
the blade of groanmak yet it head flew on wound galazi in the
flank then he who had thrown the spear turn to fly for hi hand
were empti and the other follow swiftli for the heart wa out of
them and thei dare to do battl with these two no more
thu the fight wa end and from it begin till the finish wa not
longer than the time in which men might count a hundr slowli
it seem that none ar left for us to kill galazi said umslopogaa
laugh aloud ah that wa a cun fight ho you son of the
unconqu who run so fast stai your feet i give you peac you
shall live to sweep my hut and to plough my field with the other women
of my kraal now councillor the fight is done so let us to the
chief hut where masilo wait us and he turn and went with galazi
and after him follow all the peopl wonder and in silenc
when he reach the hut umslopogaa sat himself down in the place where
jikiza had sat that morn and the maid zinita came to him with a wet
cloth and wash the wound that the spear had made he thank her
then she would have wash galazi wound also and thi wa deeper
but galazi bade her to let him be roughli as he would have no woman
meddl with hi wound for neither then nor at ani other time did
galazi turn to women but he hate zinita most of them all
then umslopogaa spoke to masilo the pig who sat befor him with a
frighten face sai it seem o masilo that you have sought thi
maid zinita in marriag and against her will persecut her now i
had intend to kill you as an offer to her anger but there ha been
enough bloodlet todai yet you shall have a marriag gift to thi
girl whom i myself will take in marriag you shall give a hundr head
of cattl then get you gone from among the peopl of the ax lest a
wors thing befal you masilo the pig
so masilo rose up and went and hi face wa green with fear but he
paid the hundr head of cattl and fled toward the kraal of chaka
zinita watch him go and she wa glad of it and becaus the
slaughter had name her for hi wife
i am well rid of masilo she said aloud in the hear of galazi
but i had been better pleas to see him dead befor me
thi woman ha a fierc heart thought galazi and she will bring no
good to umslopogaa my brother
now the councillor and the captain of the peopl of the ax konza
to him whom thei name the slaughter do homag to him as chief
and holder of the ax and also thei did homag to the ax itself so
umslopogaa becam chief over thi peopl and their number wa mani
and he grew great and fat in cattl and wive and none dare to gainsai
him from time to time inde a man ventur to stand up befor him in
fight but none could conquer him and in a littl while no on sought
to face groanmak when he lift himself to peck
galazi also wa great among the peopl but dwelt with them littl for
best he love the wild wood and the mountain breast and often as of
old he swept at night across the forest and the plain and the howl
of the ghostwolv went with him
but henceforth umslopogaa the slaughter hunt veri rare with the
wolv at night he slept at the side of zinita and she love him much
and bore him children

knew thi when all were brought togeth a great pit wa dug and the
bone were set out in order in the pit and buri but not alon for
round them were place twelv maiden of the servant of unandi and
these maiden were cover over with the earth and left to die in the
pit by the bone of unandi their mistress moreov all those who were
present at the burial were made into a regiment and command that thei

should be sown that year that the milk of the cow should be spill
upon the ground and that no woman should give birth to a child for a
full year and that if ani should dare to bear children then that thei
should be slain and their husband with them and for a space of some
month these thing were done my father and great sorrow came upon the
land
then for a littl while there wa quiet and chaka went about heavili
and he wept often and we who wait on him wept also as we walk till
at length it came about by us that we could weep without ceas for
mani hour no angri woman can weep as we wept in those dai it wa an
art my father for the teach of which i receiv mani cattl for
woe to him who had no tear in those dai then it wa also that chaka
sent out the captain and fifti soldier to search for umslopogaa for
though he said noth more to me of thi matter he did not believ all
the tale that i had told him of the death of umslopogaa in the jaw of
a lion and the tale of those who were with me how that compani fare at
the hand of umslopogaa and of galazi the wolf and at the fang of
the peopl black and grei i have told you my father none of them ever
came back again in after dai it wa report to the king that these
soldier were miss never have return but he onli laugh
sai that the lion which at umslopogaa son of mopo wa a fierc

at last came the night of the new moon that dread night to be
follow by a more dread morrow i sat in the kraal of chaka and he
put hi arm about my neck and groan and wept for hi mother whom he
had murder and i groan also but i did not weep becaus it wa
dark and on the morrow i must weep much in the sight of king and men
therefor i spare my tear lest thei should fail me in my need
all night long the peopl drew on from everi side toward the kraal
and as thei came in thousand and ten of thousand thei fill the
night with their cri till it seem as though the whole world were
mourn and loudli none might ceas their cry and none dare
to drink so much as a cup of water the daylight came and chaka rose
sai come let us go forth mopo and look on those who mourn with
us so we went out and after us came men arm with club to do the
bid of the king
outsid the kraal the peopl were gather and their number wa
countless as the leav upon the tree on everi side the land wa black
with them as at time the veldt is black with game when thei saw the
king thei ceas from their howl and sang the warsong then onc
again thei howl and chaka walk among them weep now my father
the sight becam dread for as the sun rose higher the dai grew hot
and utter weari came upon the peopl who were pack togeth like
herd of cattl and though oxen slain in sacrific lai around thei
might neither eat nor drink some fell to the ground and were trampl
to death other took too much snuff to make them weep other stain
their ey with saliva other walk to and fro their tongu hang
from their jaw while groan broke from their parch throat
now mopo we shall learn who ar the wizard that have brought these
ill upon us said the king and who ar the trueheart men
as we spoke we cam upon a man a chief of renown he wa name
zwaumbana chief of the amabovu and with him were hi wive and
follow thi man could weep no more he gasp with thirst and heat
the king look at him
see mopo he said see that brute who ha no tear for my mother who
is dead oh the monster without a heart shall such as he live to look
upon the sun while i and thou must weep mopo never never take him
awai and all those who ar with him take them awai the peopl without
heart who do not weep becaus my mother is dead by witchcraft
and chaka walk on weep and i follow also weep but the chief
zwaumbana and those with him were all slain by those who do the bid
of the king and the slayer also must weep as thei slew present
we came upon anoth man who see the king took snuff secretli to
bring tear to hi ey but the glanc of chaka wa quick and he note
it
look at him mopo he said look at the wizard who ha no tear
though my mother is dead by witchcraft see he take snuff to bring
tear to hi ey that ar dry with wicked take him awai the
heartless brute oh take him awai
so thi on also wa kill and these were but the first of thousand
for present chaka grew mad with wicked with furi and with the
lust of blood he walk to and fro weep go now and again into
hi hut to drink beer and i with him for he said that we who sorrow
must have food and ever as he walk he would wave hi arm or hi
assegai sai take them awai the heartless brute who do not weep
becaus my mother is dead and those who chanc to stand befor hi
arm were kill till at length the slayer could slai no more and
themselv were slain becaus their strength had fail them and thei
had no more tear and i also i must slai lest if i slew not i should
myself be slain
and now at length the peopl also went mad with their thirst and the
furi of their fear thei fell upon each other kill each other everi
man who had a foe sought him out and kill him none were spare the
place wa but a shambl there on that dai di full seven thousand
men and still chaka walk weep among them sai take them awai
the heartless brute take them awai yet my father there wa cun
in hi cruelti for though he destroi mani for sport alon also he
slew on thi dai all those whom he hate or whom he fear
at length the night came down the sun sank red that dai all the sky
wa like blood and blood wa all the earth beneath then the kill
ceas becaus none had now the strength to kill and the peopl lai
pant in heap upon the ground the live and the dead togeth i
look at them and saw that if thei were not allow to eat and drink
befor dai dawn again the most of them would be dead and i spoke to
the king for i care littl in that hour if i live or di even my
hope of vengeanc wa forgotten in the sick of my heart
a mourn inde o king i said a merri mourn for trueheart

eaten nor drunk for a dai and a night and for a dai and a night thei
have wail and moan look without black on there thei lie in heap

now chaka thought awhil and he saw that the work would go too far
leav him but a small peopl over whom to rule
it is hard mopo he said that thou and i must mourn alon over
our woe while these dog feast and make merri yet becaus of the
gentl of my heart i will deal gentli with them go out son of
makedama and bid my children eat and drink if thei have the heart for

spirit will haunt my dream yet becaus of the gentl of my
heart i declar thi mourn end let my children eat and drink if
inde thei have the heart
happi ar the peopl over whom such a king is set i said in answer
then i went out and told the word of chaka to the chief and captain
and those of them who had the voic left to them prais the good of
the king but the most gave over suck the dew from their stick
and rush to the water like cattl that have wander five dai in the
desert and drank their fill some of them were trampl to death in the
water
afterward i slept as i might best it wa not well my father for i
knew that chaka wa not yet gut with slaughter
on the morrow mani of the peopl went back to their home have sought
leav from the king other drew awai the dead to the place of bone
and yet other were sent out in impi to kill such as had not come to
the mourn of the king when middai wa past chaka said that he would
walk and order me and other of hi induna and servant to walk with
him we went on in silenc the king lean on my shoulder as on a
stick what of thy peopl mopo he said at length what of the
langeni tribe were thei at my mourn i did not see them
then i answer that i did not know thei had been summon but the wai
wa long and the time short for so mani to march so far
dog should run swiftli when their master call mopo my servant
said chaka and the dread light came into hi ey that never shone
in the ey of ani other man then i grew sick at heart my fatherai
though i love my peopl littl and thei had driven me awai i grew
sick at heart now we had come to a spot where there is a great rift
of black rock and the name of that rift is udongalukatatiyana on
either side of thi donga the ground slope steepli down toward it
yawn lip and from it end a man mai see the open countri here
chaka sat down at the end of the rift ponder present he look up
and saw a vast multitud of men women and children who wound like a
snake across the plain beneath toward the kraal gibamaxegu
i think mopo said the king that by the colour of their shield
yonder should be the langeni tribethin own peopl mopo
it is my peopl o king i answer
then chaka sent messeng run swiftli and bade them summon the
langeni peopl to him where he sat other messeng he sent also to the
kraal whisper in their ear but what he said i did not know then
now for a while chaka watch the long black snake of men wind
toward him across the plain till the messeng met them and the snake
began to climb the slope of the hill
how mani ar these peopl of thine mopo ask the king
i know not o eleph i answer who have not seen them for mani
year perhap thei number three full regiment
nai more said the king what thinkest thou mopo would thi peopl
of thine fill the rift behind us and he nod at the gulf of stone
now my father i trembl in all my flesh see the purpos of chaka
but i could find no word to sai for my tongu clave to the roof of my
mouth
the peopl ar mani said chaka yet mopo i bet thee fifti head of
cattl that thei will not fill the donga
the king is pleas to jest i said
yea mopo i jest yet as a jest take thou the bet
as the king will i murmuredwho could not refus now the peopl
of my tribe drew near at their head wa an old man with white hair and
beard and look at him i knew him for my father makedama when he
came within earshot of the king he gave him the royal salut of bayet
and fell upon hi hand and knee crawl toward him and konza to
the king prais him as he came all the thousand of the peopl also
fell on their hand and knee and prais the king aloud and the sound
of their prais wa like the sound of a great thunder
at length makedama my father writh on hi breast like a snake lai
befor the majesti of the king chaka bade him rise and greet him
kindli but all the thousand of the peopl yet lai upon their breast
beat the dust with their head
rise makedama my child father of the peopl of the langeni said
chaka and tell me why art thou late in come to my mourn
the wai wa far o king answer makedama my father who did not
know me the wai wa far and the time short moreov the women and
the children grew weari and footsor and thei ar weari in thi hour

with me an houri it not so now hearken bid thy peopl pass to the
right and to the left of me and stand in all their number upon the
slope of the grass that run down to the lip of the rift
so makedama my father bade the peopl do the bid of the king for
neither he nor the induna saw hi purpos but i who knew hi wick
heart i saw it then the peopl file past to the right and to the
left by hundr and by thousand and present the grass of the slope
could be seen no more becaus of their number when all had pass
chaka spoke again to makedama my father bid him climb down to the
bottom of the donga and thenc lift up hi voic in mourn the old
man obei the king slowli and with much pain he clamber to the
bottom of the rift and stood there it wa so deep and narrow that the
light scarc seem to reach to where he stood for i could onli see
the white of hi hair gleam far down in the shadow
then stand far beneath he lift up hi voic and it reach the
thousand of those who cluster upon the slope it seem still and
small yet it came to them faintli like the voic of on speak from a
mountaintop in a time of snow

let your tear fall as the rain fall let your cri be as the cri

children
mourn peopl of the langeni let the voic of your mourn beat
against the ski and rend them
ouai ouai ouai
thu sang the old man my father makedama far down in the deep of the
cleft he sang it in a still small voic but line after line hi
song wa caught up by the thousand who stood on the slope abov
and thunder to the heaven till the mountain shook with it sound
moreov the nois of their cry open the bosom of a heavi
raincloud that had gather as thei mourn and the rain fell in
great slow drop as though the sky also wept and with the rain came
lightn and the roll of thunder
chaka listen and larg tear cours down hi cheek whose heart
wa easili stir by the sound of song now the rain hiss fierc
make as it were a curtain about the thousand of the peopl but still
their cry went up through the rain and the roll of the thunder wa lost
in it present there came a hush and i look to the right there
abov the head of the peopl come over the brow of the hill were
the plume of warrior and in their hand gleam a hedg of spear
i look to the left there also i saw the plume of warrior dimli
through the fall rain and in their hand a hedg of spear i look
befor me toward the end of the cleft there also loom the plume of
warrior and in their hand wa a hedg of spear
then from all the peopl there aros anoth cry a cry of terror and
of agoni
ah now thei mourn inde mopo said chaka in my ear now thy peopl
mourn from the heart and not with the lip alon
as he spoke the multitud of the peopl on either side of the rift
surg forward like a wave surg back again onc more surg forward
then with a dread cry driven on by the merciless spear of the
soldier thei began to fall in a torrent of men women and children
far into the black depth below
my father forgiv me the tear that fall from these blind ey of mine
i am veri ag i am but as a littl child and as a littl child i
weep i cannot tell it at last it wa done and all grew still
thu wa makedama buri beneath the bodi of hi peopl thu wa

about and thu did chaka take vengeanc for that cup of milk which wa
refus to him mani a year befor

i look up my father and i saw thi i saw baleka my sister walk
toward us and on her shoulder wa a kaross of wildcat skin and
behind her were two soldier she walk proudli hold her head high
and her step wa like the step of a queen now she saw the sight of
death for the dead lai befor her like black water in a sunless pool a
moment she stood shiver have guess all then walk on and stood
befor chaka
what is thy will with me o king she said
thou art come in a good hour sister said chaka turn hi ey
from her it is thu mopo my servant and thy brother made a bet
with me a bet of cattl it wa a littl matter that we wager ona
to whether the peopl of the langeni tribethin own tribe baleka my
sisterwould fill yonder place udongalukatatiyana when thei heard
of the bet my sister the peopl of the langeni hurl themselv into
the rift by thousand be eager to put the matter to the proof and
now it seem that thy brother ha lost the bet for there is yet place
for on yonder er the donga is full then my sister thy brother mopo
brought it to my mind that there wa still on of the langeni tribe left
upon the earth who should she sleep in that place would turn the bet
in hi favour and prai me to send for her so my sister as i would
not take that which i have not won i have done so and now do thou go
apart and talk with mopo thy brother alon upon thi matter as onc
befor thou didst talk when a child wa born to thee my sister
now baleka took no heed of the word of chaka which he spoke of me for
she knew hi mean well onli she look him in the ey and said
ill shalt thou sleep from thi night forth chaka till thou comest to
a land where no sleep is i have spoken
chaka saw and heard and of a sudden he quail grow afraid in hi
heart and turn hi head awai
mopo my brother said baleka let us speak togeth for the last
time it is the king word
so i drew apart with baleka my sister and a spear wa in my hand
we stood togeth alon by the peopl of the dead and baleka threw
the corner of the kaross about her brow and spoke to me swiftli from
beneath it shadow
what did i sai to you a while ago mopo it ha come to pass swear to
me that you will live on and that thi same hand of your shall taken

that night the curs of baleka fell upon chaka and he slept ill so
ill did he sleep that he summon me to him bid me walk abroad with
him i went and we walk alon and in silenc chaka lead the wai
and i follow after him now i saw that hi feet led him toward the
udongalukatatiyana that place where all my peopl lai dead and
with them baleka my sister we climb the slope of the hill slowli
and came to the mouth of the cleft to that same spot where chaka had
stood when the peopl fell over the lip of the rock like water then
there had been nois and cry now there wa silenc for the night
wa veri still the moon wa full also and light up the dead who lai
near to us so that i could see them all ye i could see even the face
of baleka my sisterthei had thrown her into the midst of the dead
never had it look so beauti as in thi hour and yet as i gaze i
grew afraid onli the far end of the donga wa hid in shadow
thou wouldst not have won thy bet now mopo my servant said chaka
see thei have sunk togeth the donga is not full by the length of a
stabbingspear
i did not answer but at the sound of the king voic jackal stir
and slunk awai
present he spoke again laugh loudli as he spoke thou shouldst
sleep well thi night my mother for i have sent mani to hush thee to
rest ah peopl of the langeni tribe you forgot but i rememb you
forgot how a woman and a boi came to you seek food and shelter and
you would give them noneno not a gourd of milk what did i promis
you on that dai peopl of the langeni tribe did i not promis you that
for everi drop the gourd i crave would hold i would take the life of a
man and have i not kept my promis do not men lie here more in number
than the drop of water in a gourd and with them woman and children
countless as the leav o peopl of the langeni tribe who refus
me milk when i wa littl have grown great i am aveng upon you
have grown great ah who is there so great as i the earth shake
beneath my feet when i speak the peopl trembl when i frown thei
diethei die in thousand i have grown great and great i shall
remain the land is mine far as the feet of man can travel the land
is mine and mine ar those who dwell in it and i shall grow greater
yetgreat ever greater is it thy face baleka that stare upon
me from among the face of the thousand whom i have slain thou didst
promis me that i should sleep ill henceforth baleka i fear thee
notat the least thou sleepest sound tell me balekaris from thy
sleep and tell me whom there is that i should fearand suddenli he
ceas the rave of hi pride
now my father while chaka the king spoke thu it came into my mind to
make an end of thing and kill him for my heart wa made with rage and
the thirst of vengeanc alreadi i stood behind him alreadi the stick
in my hand wa lift to strike out hi brain when i stop also for
i saw someth there in the midst of the dead i saw an arm stir it
stir it lift itself it beckon toward the shadow which hid the
head of the cleft and the piledup corps that lai there and it seem
to me that the arm wa the arm of baleka perchanc it wa not her arm
perchanc it wa but the arm of on who yet live among the thousand
of the dead sai you my father at the least the arm rose at her side
and wa ring with such bracelet as baleka wore and it beckon from
her side though her cold face chang not at all thrice the arm rose
thrice it stood awhil in air thrice it beckon with crook finger
as though it summon someth from the depth of the shadow and from
the multitud of the dead then it fell down and in the utter silenc
i heard it fall and a clank of brazen bracelet and as it fell there
rose from the shadow a sound of sing of sing wild and sweet such
as i had never heard the word of that song came to me then my father
but afterward thei pass from me and i rememb them no more onli
i know thi that the song wa of the make of thing and of the
begin and the end of peopl it told of how the black folk grew
and of how the white folk should eat them up and wherefor thei were
and wherefor thei should ceas to be it told of evil and of good of
woman and of man and of how these war against each other and why it
is that thei war and what ar the end of the struggl it told also of
the peopl of the zulu and it spoke of a place of a littl hand where
thei should conquer and of a place where a white hand should prevail
against them and how thei shall melt awai beneath the shadow of the
white hand and be forgotten pass to a land where thing do not die
but live on forev the good with the good the evil with the evil it
told of life and of death of joi and of sorrow of time and of that sea
in which time is but a float leaf and of why all these thing ar
mani name also came into the song and i knew but a few of them yet my
own wa there and the name of baleka and the name of umslopogaa and
the name of chaka the lion but a littl while did the voic sing yet
all thi wa in the songai and much more but the mean of the song
is gone from me though i knew it onc and shall know it again when all
is done the voic in the shadow sang on till the whole place wa full
of the sound of it sing and even the dead seem to listen chaka
heard it and shook with fear but hi ear were deaf to it burden
though mine were open
the voic came nearer and now in the shadow there wa a faint glow of
light like the glow that gather on the sixdai dead slowli it drew
nearer through the shadow and as it came i saw that the shape of the
light wa the shape of a woman now i could see it well and i knew the
face of glori my father it wa the face of the inkosazanayzulu the
queen of heaven she came toward us veri slowli glide down the gulf
that wa full of dead and the path she trod wa pave with the dead
and as she came it seem to me that shadow rose from the dead
follow her the queen of the deadthousand upon thousand of them
and ah her glori my fatherth glori of her hair of molten goldof
her ey that were as the noondai skyth flash of her arm and
breast that were like the driven snow when it glow in the sunset her
beauti wa aw to look on but i am glad to have live to see it as it
shone and chang in the shift robe of light which wa her garment
now she drew near to us and chaka sank upon the earth huddl up
in fear hide hi face in hi hand but i wa not afraid my
fatheronli the wick need fear to look on the queen of heaven nai
i wa not afraid i stood upright and gaze upon her glori face to face
in her hand she held a littl spear haft with the royal wood it wa
the shadow of the spear that chaka held in hi hand the same with which
he had slain hi mother and wherewith he should himself be slain now
she ceas her sing and stood befor the crouch king and befor
me who wa behind the king so that the light of her glori shone upon
us she lift the littl spear and with it touch chaka son of
senzangacona on the brow give him to doom then she spoke but
though chaka felt the touch he did not hear the word that were for my
ear alon
mopo son of makedama said the low voic stai thy hand the cup of
chaka is not full when for the third time thou seest me ride down
the storm then smite mopo my child
thu she spoke and a cloud swept over the face of the moon when it
pass she wa gone and onc more i wa alon with chaka with the
night and the dead
chaka look up and hi face wa grei with the sweat of fear
who wa thi mopo he said in a hollow voic
thi wa the inkosazana of the heaven she who watch ever over the
peopl of our race o king and who from time to time is seen of men er
great thing shall befal
i have heard speak of thi queen said chaka wherefor came she now
what wa the song she sang and why did she touch me with a spear
she came o king becaus the dead hand of baleka summon her as thou
sawest the song she sang wa of thing too high for me and why she
touch thee on the forehead with the spear i do not know o king
perchanc it wa to crown thee chief of a yet greater realm
yea perchanc to crown me chief of a realm of death
that thou art alreadi black on i answer glanc at the silent
multitud befor us and the cold shape of baleka
again chaka shudder come let us be go mopo he said now i
have learnt what it is to be afraid
earli or late fear is a guest that all must feast even king o
earthshak i answer and we turn and went homeward in silenc
now after thi night chaka gave it out that the kraal of gibamaxegu wa
bewitch and bewitch wa the land of the zulu becaus he might
sleep no more in peac but woke ever cry out with fear and
mutter the name of baleka therefor in the end he move hi kraal
far awai and built the great town of duguza here in natal
look now my father there on the plain far awai is a place of the white
menit is call stanger there where is the white man town stood
the great kraal duguza i cannot see for my ey ar dark but you can
see where the gate of the kraal wa built there is a hous it is the
place where the white man give out justic that is the place of the
gate of the kraal through which justic never walk behind is anoth
hous where the white men who have sin against him prai to the king
of heaven for forgiv there on that spot have i seen mani a on who
had done no wrong prai to a king of men for merci but i have never seen
but on who found it ou the word of chaka have come true i will tell
them to you present my father the white man hold the land he goe
to and fro about hi busi of peac where impi ran forth to kill
hi children laugh and gather flower where men di in blood by
hundr thei bath in the water of the imbozamo where onc the
crocodil were fed daili with human flesh hi young men woo the
maiden where other maid have kiss the assegai it is chang
noth is the same and of chaka ar left onli a grave yonder and a
name of fear
now after chaka had come to the duguza kraal for a while he sat quiet
then the old thirst of blood came on him and he sent hi impi against
the peopl of the pondo and thei destroi that peopl and brought
back their cattl but the warrior might not rest again thei
were doctor for war and sent out by ten of thousand to conquer
sotyangana chief of the peopl who live north of the limpopo thei
went sing after the king had look upon them and bidden them return
victori or not at all their number wa so great that from the hour
of dawn till the sun wa high in the heaven thei pass the gate of
the kraal like countless herd of cattlethei the unconqu littl
did thei know that victori smile on them no more that thei must die
by thousand of hunger and fever in the marsh of the limpopo and
that those of them who return should come with their shield in their
belli have devour their shield becaus of their raven hunger
but what of them thei were noth dust wa the name of on of
the great regiment that went out against sotyangana and dust thei
weredust to be driven to death by the breath of chaka lion of the
zulu
now few men remain in the kraal duguza for nearli all had gone
with the impi and onli women and ag peopl were left dingaan and
umhlangana brother of the king were there for chaka would not suffer
them to depart fear lest thei should plot against him and he look
on them alwai with an angri ey so that thei trembl for their live
though thei dare not show their fear lest fate should follow fear but
i guess it and like a snake i wound myself into their secret and we
talk togeth darkli and in hint but of that present my father
for i must tell of the come of masilo he who would have wed zinita
and whom umslopogaa the slaughter had driven out from the kraal of
the peopl of the ax
it wa on the dai after the impi had left that masilo came to the kraal
duguza crave leav to speak with the king chaka sat befor hi hut
and with him were dingaan and umhlangana hi royal brother i wa
there also and certain of the induna councillor of the king chaka
wa weari that morn for he had slept badli as now he alwai did
therefor when on told him that a certain wander name masilo would
speak with him he did not command that the man should be kill but
bade them bring him befor him present there wa a sound of prais
and i saw a fat man much worn with travel who crawl through the dust
toward us give the sibonga that is name the king by hi royal
name chaka bade him ceas from prais and tell hi busi then
the man sat up and told all that tale which you have heard my father
of how a young man great and strong came to the place of the peopl of
the ax and conquer jikiza the holder of the ax and becom chief of
that peopl and of how he had taken the cattl of masilo and driven him
awai now chaka knew noth of thi peopl of the ax for the land wa
great in those dai my father and there were mani littl tribe in it
live far awai of whom the king had not even heard so he question
masilo about them and of the number of their fightingmen of their
wealth in cattl of the name of the young man who rule them and
especi as to the tribut which thei paid to the king
masilo answer sai that the number of their fightingmen wa
perhap the half of a full regiment that their cattl were mani for
thei were rich that thei paid no tribut and that the name of the
young man wa bulalio the slaughtererat the least he wa known by
that name and he had heard no other
then the king grew wroth aris masilo he said and run to thi
peopl and speak in the ear of the peopl and of him who is name the
slaughter sai there is anoth slaughter who sit in a kraal
that is name duguza and thi is hi word to you o peopl of the ax
and to thee thou who holdest the ax rise up with all the peopl and
with all the cattl of your peopl and come befor him who sit in the
kraal duguza and lai in hi hand the great ax groanmak rise up
swiftli and do thi bid lest ye sit down shortli and for the last
time of all 1
1 the zulu ar buri sit
masilo heard and said that it should be so though the wai wa far and
he fear greatli to appear befor him who wa call the slaughter
and who sat twenti dai journei to the north beneath the shadow of the
witch mountain
begon said the king and stand befor me on the thirtieth dai from
now with the answer of thi boi with an ax if thou standest not befor
me then some shall come to seek thee and the boi with an ax also
so masilo turn and fled swiftli to do the bid of the king and
chaka spoke no more of that matter but i wonder in my heart who thi
young man with an ax might be for i thought that he had dealt with
jikiza and with the son of jikiza as umslopogaa would have dealt with
them had he come to the year of hi manhood but i also said noth of
the matter
now on thi dai also there came to me new that my wife macropha and
my daughter nada were dead among their peopl in swaziland it wa said
that the men of the chief of the halakazi tribe had fallen on their
kraal and put all in it to the assegai and among them macropha and
nada i heard the new but i wept no tear for my father i wa so
lost in sorrow that noth could move me ani more
chapter xx mopo bargain with the princ
eightandtwenti dai went by my father and on the nineandtwentieth
it befel that chaka have dream a dream in hi troubl sleep
summon befor him certain women of the kraal to the number of
a hundr or more some of these were hi women whom he name hi
sister and some were maiden not yet given in marriag but all
were young and fair now what thi dream of chaka mai have been i do not
know or have forgotten for in those dai he dream mani dream and
all hi dream led to on end the death of men he sat in front of hi
hut scowl and i wa with him to the left of him were gather the
girl and women and their knee were weak with fear on by on thei
were led befor him and stood befor him with bow head then he
would bid them be of good cheer and speak softli to them and in the
end would ask them thi question hast thou my sister a cat in thy
hut
now some would sai that thei had a cat and some would sai that thei
had none and some would stand still and make no answer be dumb with
fear but whatev thei said the end wa the same for the king would
sigh gentli and sai fare thee well my sister it is unfortun for
thee that there is a cat in thy hut or that there is no cat in thy
hut or that thou canst not tell me whether there be a cat in thy hut
or no
then the woman would be taken by the slayer drag without the kraal
and their end wa swift so it went on for the most part of that dai
till sixtyandtwo women and girl had been slaughter but at last a
maiden wa brought befor the king and to thi on her snake had given
a readi wit for when chaka ask her whether or no there wa a cat in
her hut she answer sai that she did not know but that there wa
a half a cat upon her and she point to a catsskin which wa bound
about her loin
then the king laugh and clap hi hand sai that at length hi
dream wa answer and he kill no more that dai nor ever againsav
onc onli
that even my heart wa heavi within me and i cri in my heart
how longnor might i rest so i wander out from the kraal that wa
name duguza to the great cleft in the mountain yonder and sat down
upon a rock high up in the cleft so that i could see the wide land
roll to the north and the south to my right and to my left now the
dai wa draw toward the night and the air wa veri still for the
heat wa great and a tempest wa gather as i who am a heavenherd
knew well the sun sank redli flood the land with blood it wa as
though all the blood that chaka had shed flow about the land which
chaka rule then from the womb of the night great shape of cloud rose
up and stood befor the sun and he crown them with hi glori and in
their heart the lightn quiver like a blood of fire the shadow
of their wing fell upon the mountain and the plain and beneath their
wing wa silenc slowli the sun sank and the shape of cloud gather
togeth like a host at the word of it captain and the flicker of the
lightn wa as the flash of the spear of a host i look and my
heart grew afraid the lightn di awai the silenc deepen and
deepen till i could hear it no leaf move no bird call the world
seem deadi alon live in the dead world
now of a sudden my father a bright star fell from the height of
heaven and lit upon the crest of the storm and as it lit the storm
burst the grei air shiver a moan ran about the rock and di awai
then an ici breath burst from the lip of the tempest and rush across
the earth it caught the fall star and drove it on toward me a
rush globe of fire and as it came the star grew and took shape and
the shape it took wa the shape of a woman i knew her now my father
while she wa yet far off i knew herth inkosazana who came as she
had promis ride down the storm on she swept born forward by
the blast and oh she wa terribl to see for her garment wa the
lightn lightn shone from her wide ey and lightn were in
her stream hair while in her hand wa a spear of fire and she shook
it as she came now she wa at the mouth of the pass befor her wa
still behind her beat the wing of the storm the thunder roar
the rain hiss like snake she rush on past me and as she pass
she turn her aw ey upon me wither me she wa there she wa
gone but she spoke no word onli shook her flame spear yet it seem
to me that the storm spoke that the rock cri aloud that the rain
hiss out a word in my ear and the word wa
smite mopo
i heard it in my heart or with my ear what doe it matter then i
turn to look through the rush of the tempest and the reek of the
rain still i could see her sweep forward high in air now the kraal
duguza wa beneath her feet and the flame spear fell from her hand
upon the kraal and fire leap up in answer
then she pass on over the edg of the world seek her own place
thu my father for the third and last time did my ey see the
inkosazanayzulu or mayhap my heart dream that i saw her soon i
shall see her again but it will not be here
for a while i sat there in the cleft then i rose and fought my wai
through the furi of the storm back to the kraal duguza as i drew near
the kraal i heard cri of fear come through the roar of the wind
and the hiss of the rain i enter and ask on of the matter and it
wa told me that fire from abov had fallen on the hut of the king as he
lai sleep and all the roof of the hut wa burn awai but that the
rain had put out the fire
then i went on till i came to the front of the great hut and i saw by
the light of the moon which now shone out in the heaven that there
befor it stood chaka shake with fear and the water of the rain wa
run down him while he stare at the great hut of which all the
thatch wa burn
i salut the king ask him what evil thing had happen see me
he seiz me by the arm and clung to me as when the slayer ar at
hand a child cling to hi father draw me after him into a small
hut that wa near
what evil thing ha befallen o king i said again when light had
been made

ay as much afraid as when onc on a bygon night the dead hand of
baleka summon someth that walk upon the face of the dead
and what fearest thou o king who art the lord of all the earth
now chaka lean forward and whisper to me hearken mopo i have

chapter xxi the death of chaka
now on the morrow two hour befor middai chaka came from the
hut where he had sat through the night and move to a littl kraal
surround by a fenc that wa some fifti pace distant from the hut
for it wa my duti dai by dai to choos that place where the king
should sit to hear the counsel of hi induna and give judgment on
those whom he would kill and todai i had chosen thi place chaka went
alon from hi hut to the kraal and for my own reason i accompani
him walk after him as we went the king glanc back at me over hi
shoulder and said in a low voic
is all prepar mopo
all is prepar black on i answer the regiment of the slayer
will be here by noon
where ar the princ mopo ask the king again
the princ sit with their wive in the hous of their women o king
i answer thei drink beer and sleep in the lap of their wive
chaka smile grimli for the last time mopo
for the last time o king
we came to the kraal and chaka sat down in the shade of the reed fenc
upon an oxhid that wa brai soft near to him stood a girl hold a
gourd of beer there were also present the old chief inguazonca brother
of unandi mother of the heaven and the chief umxamama whom chaka
love when we had sat a littl while in the kraal certain men came
in bear crane feather which the king had sent them to gather a
month journei from the kraal duguza and thei were admit befor
the king these men had been awai long upon their errand and chaka
wa angri with them now the leader of the men wa an old captain of
chaka who had fought under him in mani battl but whose servic wa
done becaus hi right hand had been shorn awai by the blow of an ax
he wa a great man and veri brave
chaka ask the man why he had been so long in find the feather
and he answer that the bird had flown from that part of the countri
whither he wa sent and he must wait there till thei return that he
might snare them
thou shouldst have follow the crane ye if thei flew through the
sunset thou disobedi dog said the king let him be taken awai
and all those who were with him
now some of the men prai a littl for merci but the captain did but
salut the king call him father and crave a boon befor he
di
what wouldst thou ask chaka
my father said the man i would ask thee two thing i have fought
mani time at thy side in battl while we both were young nor did i
ever turn my back upon the foe the blow that shore the hand from off
thi arm wa aim at thy head o king i stai it with my nake arm
it is noth at thy will i live and at thy will i die who am i that
i should question the word of the king yet i would ask thi that thou
wilt withdraw the kaross from about thee o king that for the last time
my ey mai feast themselv upon the bodi of him whom abov all men i
love
thou art longwind said the king what more
thi my father that i mai bid farewel to my son he is a littl
child so high o king and he held hi hand abov hi knee
thy first boon is grant said the king slip the kaross from hi
shoulder and show the great breast beneath for the second it shall
be grant also for i will not willingli divid the father and the son
bring the boi here thou shalt bid him farewel then thou shalt slai
him with thine own hand er thou thyself art slain it will be good
sport to see
now the man turn grei beneath the black of hi skin and trembl
a littl as he murmur the king will is the will of hi servant
let the child be brought
but i look at chaka and saw that the tear were run down hi face
and that he onli spoke thu to try the captain who love him to the
last
let the man go said the king him and those with him
so thei went glad at heart and prais the king
i have told you thi my father though it ha not to do with my stori
becaus then and then onli did i ever see chaka show merci to on whom
he had doom to die
as the captain and hi peopl left the gate of the kraal it wa spoken
in the ear of the king that a man sought audienc with him he wa
admit crawl on hi knee i look and saw that thi wa that
masilo whom chaka had charg with a messag to him who wa name
bulalio or the slaughter and who rule over the peopl of the ax
it wa masilo inde but he wa no longer fat for much travel had made
him thin moreov on hi back were the mark of rod as yet scarc
heal over
who art thou said chaka
i am masilo of the peopl of the ax to whom command wa given to run
with a messag to bulalio the slaughter their chief and to return
on the thirtieth dai behold o king i have return though in a sorri
plight
it seem so said the king laugh aloud i rememb now speak on
masilo the thin who wast masilo the fat what of thi slaughter doe
he come with hi peopl to lai the ax groanmak in my hand
nai o king he come not he met me with scorn and with scorn
he drove me from hi kraal moreov as i went i wa seiz by the
servant of zinita she whom i woo but who is now the wife of the
slaughter and laid on my face upon the ground and beaten cruelli
while zinita number the stroke
hah said the king and what were the word of thi puppi
these were hi word o king bulalio the slaughter who sit
beneath the shadow of the witch mountain to bulalio the slaughter who
sit in the kraal duguzato thee i pai no tribut if thou wouldst
have the ax groanmak come to the ghost mountain and take it thi
i promis thee thou shalt look on a face thou knowest for there is on
there who would be aveng for the blood of a certain mopo
now while masilo told thi tale i had seen two thingsfirst that a
littl piec of stick wa thrust through the straw of the fenc and
secondli that the regiment of the bee wa swarm on the slope
opposit to the kraal in obedi to the summon i had sent them in
the name of umhlangana the stick told me that the princ were hidden
behind the fenc wait the signal and the come of the regiment that
it wa time to do the deed
when masilo had spoken chaka sprang up in furi hi ey roll hi
face work foam flew from hi lip for such word as these had never
offend hi ear sinc he wa king and masilo knew him littl els he
had not dare to utter them
for a while he gasp shake hi small spear for at first he could
not speak at length he found word
the dog he hiss the dog who dare thu to spit in my face
hearken all as with my last breath i command that thi slaughter
be torn limb from limb he and all hi tribe and thou thou darest to
bring me thi talk from a skunk of the mountain and thou too mopo
thy name is name in it well of thee present ho umxamama my
servant slai me thi slave of a messeng beat out hi brain with thy
stick swift swift
now the old chief umxamama sprang up to do the king bid but he
wa feebl with ag and the end of it wa that masilo be mad with
fear kill umxamama not umxamama masilo then inguazonca brother of
unandi mother of the heaven fell upon masilo and end him but wa
hurt himself in so do now i look at chaka who stood shake the
littl red spear and thought swiftli for the hour had come
help i cri on is slai the king
as i spoke the reed fenc burst asund and through it plung the
princ umhlangana and dingaan as bull plung through a brake
then i point to chaka with my wither hand sai behold your
king
now from beneath the shelter of hi kaross each princ drew out a
short stab spear and plung it into the bodi of chaka the king
umhlangana smote him on the left shoulder dingaan struck him in the
right side chaka drop the littl spear handl with the red wood and
look round and so royal that the princ hi brother grew afraid
and shrank awai from him
twice he look on each then he spoke sai what do you slai me
my brothersdog of mine own hous whom i have fed do you slai me
think to possess the land and to rule it i tell you it shall not
be for long i hear a sound of run feetth feet of a great white
peopl thei shall stamp you flat children of my father thei shall
rule the land that i have won and you and your peopl shall be their
slave
thu chaka spoke while the blood ran down him to the ground and again
he look on them royal like a buck at gaze
make an end o ye who would be king i cri but their heart had
turn to water and thei could not then i mopo sprang forward and
pick from the ground that littl assegai handl with the royal
woodth same assegai with which chaka had murder unandi hi mother
and moosa my son and lift it on high and while i lift it my
father onc more as when i wa young a red veil seem to wave befor
my ey
wherefor wouldst thou kill me mopo said the king
for the sake of baleka my sister to whom i swore the deed and of all
my kin i cri and plung the spear through him he sank down upon
the tan oxhid and lai there dy onc more he spoke and onc
onli sai would now that i had hearken to the voic of nobela
who warn me against thee thou dog
then he wa silent for ever but i knelt over him and call in hi ear
the name of all those of my blood who had di at hi handsth name
of makedama my father of my mother of anadi my wife of moosa my son
and all my other wive and children and of baleka my sister hi ey
and ear were open and i think my father that he saw and understood
i think also that the hate upon my face as i shook my wither hand
befor him wa more fear to him that the pain of death at the least
he turn hi head asid shut hi ey and groan present thei
open again and he wa dead
thu then my father did chaka the king the greatest man who ha ever
live in zululand and the most evil pass by my hand to those kraal
of the inkosazana where no sleep is in blood he di as he had live in
blood for the climber at last fall with the tree and in the end the
swimmer is born awai by the stream now he trod that path which had
been beaten flat for him by the feet of peopl whom he had slaughter
mani as the blade of grass upon a mountainsid but it is a lie to
sai as some do that he di a coward prai for merci chaka di
as he had live a brave man ou my father i know it for these ey
saw it and thi hand let out hi life
now he wa dead and the regiment of the bee drew near nor could i know
how thei would take thi matter for though the princ umhlangana wa
their gener yet all the soldier love the king becaus he had no
equal in battl and when he gave he gave with an open hand i look
round the princ stood like men amaz the girl had fled the
chief umxamama wa dead at the hand of dead masilo and the old chief
inguazonca who had kill masilo stood by hurt and wonder there
were no other in the kraal
awak ye king i cri to the brother the impi is at the gate
swift now stab that manand i point to the old chiefand leav
the matter to my wit
then dingaan rous himself and spring upon inguazonca the brother
of unandi smote him a great blow with hi spear so that he sank down
dead without a word then again the princ stood silent and amaz
thi on will tell no tale i cri point at the fallen chief
now a rumour of the slai had got abroad among the women who had
heard cri and seen the flash of spear abov the fenc and from
the women it had come to the regiment of the bee who advanc to the
gate of the kraal sing then of a sudden thei ceas their sing
and rush toward the hut in front of which we stood
then i ran to meet them utter cri of woe hold in my hand the
littl assegai of the king red with the king blood and spoke with the
captain in the gate sai
lament ye captain and ye soldier weep and lament for your father
is no more he who nurs you is no more the king is dead now earth
and heaven will come togeth for the king is dead
how so mopo cri the leader of the bee how is our father dead
he is dead by the hand of a wick wander name masilo who when
he wa doom to die by the king snatch thi assegai from the king
hand and stab him and afterward befor he could be cut down
himself by us three the princ and myself he kill the chief
inguazonca and umxamama also draw near and look on him who wa the
king it is the command of dingaan and umhlangana the king that you
draw near and look on him who wa the king that hi death at the hand
of masilo mai be told through all the land
you ar better at make of king mopo than at the save of on who
wa your king from the stroke of a wander said the leader of the
bee look at me doubtfulli
but hi word pass unheed for some of the captain went forward to
look on the great on who wa dead and some togeth with most of
the soldier ran thi wai and that cry in their fear that now the
heaven and earth would come togeth and the race of man would ceas to
be becaus chaka the king wa dead
now my father how shall i whose dai ar few tell you of all the
matter that happen after the dead of chaka were i to speak of them
all thei would fill mani book of the white men and perhap some of
them ar written down there for thi reason it is that i mai be brief
i have onli spoken of a few of those event which befel in the reign of
chaka for my tale is not of the reign of chaka but of the live of a
hand of peopl who live in those dai and of whom i and umslopogaa
alon ar left aliveif inde umslopogaa the son of chaka is
still live on the earth therefor in a few word i will pass over
all that came about after the fall of chaka and till i wa sent down by
dingaan the king to summon him to surrend to the king who wa call
the slaughter and who rule the peopl of the ax ah would that i
had known for certain that thi wa none other than umslopogaa for
then had dingaan gone the wai that chaka went and which umhlangana
follow and umslopogaa rule the peopl of the zulu as their king
but ala my wisdom fail me i paid no heed to the voic of my heart
which told me that thi wa umslopogaa who sent the messag to chaka
threaten vengeanc for on mopo and i knew noth till too late
sure i thought the man spoke of some other mopo for thu my
father doe destini make fool of us men we think that we can shape
our fate but it is fate that shape us and noth befal except fate
will it all thing ar a great pattern my father drawn by the hand of
the umkulunkulu upon the cup whenc he drink the water of hi wisdom
and our live and what we do and what we do not do ar but a littl
bit of the pattern which is so big that onli the ey of him who is
abov the umkulunkulu can see it all even chaka the slayer of men
and all those he slew ar but as a tini grain of dust in the great
of that pattern how then can we be wise my father who ar but the
tool of wisdom how can be build who ar but pebbl in a wall how can
we give life who ar babe in the womb of fate or how can we slai who
ar but spear in the hand of the slayer
thi came about my father matter were made straight in the land after
the death of chaka at first peopl said that masilo the stranger had
stab the king then it wa known that mopo the wise man the doctor
and the bodyserv of the king had slain the king and that the
two great bull hi brother umhlangana and dingaan children of
senzangacona had also lift spear against him but he wa dead and
earth and heaven had not come togeth so what did it matter moreov
the two new king promis to deal gentli with the peopl and to
lighten the heavi yoke of chaka and men in a bad case ar alwai readi
to home for a better so it came about that the onli enemi the
princ found were each other and engwad the son of unandi chaka
halfbroth but i mopo who wa now the first man in the land after
the king ceas to be a doctor and becom a gener went up
against engwad with the regiment of the bee and the regiment of the
slayer and smote him in hi kraal it wa a hard fight but in the end
i destroi him and all hi peopl engwad kill eight men with hi
own hand befor i slew him then i came back to the kraal with the few
that were left aliv of the two regiment
after that the two king quarrel more and more and i weigh them
both in my balanc for i would know which wa the most favour to
me in the end i found that both fear me but that umhlangana would
certainli put me to death if he gain the upper hand wherea thi
wa not yet in the mind of dingaan so i press down the balanc of
umhlangana and rais that of dingaan send the fear of umhlangana
to sleep till i could caus hi hut to be surround then umhlangana
follow upon the road of chaka hi brother the road of the assegai
and dingaan rule alon for awhil such ar the thing that befal
princ of thi earth my father see i am but a littl man and my lot
is humbl at the last yet i have brought about the death of three of
them and of these two di by my hand
it wa fourteen dai after the pass awai of the princ umhlangana
that the great armi came back in a sorri plight from the marsh of the
limpopo for half of them were left dead of fever and the might of the
foe and the rest were starv it wa well for them who yet live that
chaka wa no more els thei had join their brethren who were dead
on the wai sinc never befor for mani year had a zulu impi return
unvictori and without a singl head of cattl thu it came about
that thei were glad enough to welcom a king who spare their live and
thenceforth till hi fate found him dingaan reign unquest
now dingaan wa a princ of the blood of chaka inde for like chaka
he wa great in presenc and cruel at heart but he had not the might
and the mind of chaka moreov he wa treacher and a liar and
these chaka wa not also he love women much and spent with them the
time that he should have given to matter of the state yet he reign
awhil in the land i must tell thi also that dingaan would have
kill panda hi halfbroth so that the hous of senzangacona hi
father might be swept out clean now panda wa a man of gentl
heart who did not love war and therefor it wa thought that he
wa halfwit and becaus i love panda when the question of hi
slai came on i and the chief mapita spoke against it and plead
for him sai that there wa noth to be fear at hi hand who
wa a fool so in the end dingaan gave wai sai well you ask me to
spare thi dog and i will spare him but on dai he will bite me
so panda wa made governor of the king cattl yet in the end the
word of dingaan came true for it wa the grip of panda teeth that
pull him from the throne onli if panda wa the dog that bit i
mopo wa the man who set him on the hunt
chapter xxii mopo goe to seek the slaughter
now dingaan desert the kraal duguza move back to zululand
and built a great kraal by the mahlabatin which he name
umgugundhlovuthat is the rumbl of the eleph also he
caus all the fairest girl in the land to be sought out as hi wive
and though mani were found yet he crave for more and at thi time
a rumour came to the ear of the king dingaan that there live in
swaziland among the halakazi tribe a girl of the most wonder beauti
who wa name the lili and whose skin wa whiter than ar the skin of
our peopl and he desir greatli to have thi girl to wife so dingaan
sent an embassi to the chief of the halakazi demand that the girl
should be given to him at the end of a month the embassi return
again and told the king that thei had found noth but hard word at
the kraal of the halakazi and had been driven thenc with scorn and
blow
thi wa the messag of the chief of the halakazi to dingaan king of
the zulu that the maid who wa name the lili wa inde the wonder
of the earth and as yet unw for she had found no man upon whom she
look with favour and she wa held in such love by thi peopl that it
wa not their wish to forc ani husband on her moreov the chief said
that he and hi peopl defi dingaan and the zulu as their father
had defi chaka befor him and spat upon hi name and that no maid of
their should go to be the wife of a zulu dog
then the chief of the halakazi caus the maid who wa name the lili to
be led befor the messeng of dingaan and thei found her wonderfulli
fair for so thei said she wa tall as a reed and her grace wa the
grace of a reed that is shaken in the wind moreov her hair curl
and hung upon her shoulder her ey were larg and brown and soft as
a buck her colour wa the colour of rich cream her smile wa like a
rippl on the water and when she spoke her voic wa low and sweeter
than the sound of an instrument of music thei said also that the girl
wish to speak with them but the chief forbad it and caus her to
be led thenc with all honour
now when dingaan heard thi messag he grew mad as a lion in a net
for he desir thi maid abov everyth and yet he who had all thing
could not win the maid thi wa hi command that a great impi should
be gather and sent to swaziland against the halakazi tribe to destroi
them and seiz the maid but when the matter came on to be discuss
with the induna in the presenc of the king at the amapakati or
council i as chief of the induna spoke against it sai that the
tribe of the halakazi were great and strong and that war with them
would mean war with the swazi also moreov thei had their dwell
in cave which were had to win also i said that thi wa no time to
send impi to seek a singl girl for few year had gone by sinc the
black on fell and foe were mani and the soldier of the land had
wax few with slaughter half of them have perish in the marsh of
the limpopo now time must be given them to grow up again for todai
thei were as a littl child or like a man wast with hunger maid
were mani let the king take them and satisfi hi heart but let him
make no war for thi on
thu i spoke boldli in the face of the king as none had dare to speak
befor chaka and courag pass from me to the heart of the other
induna and gener and thei echo my word for thei knew that
of all folli to begin a new war with the swazi peopl would be the
greatest
dingaan listen and hi brow grew dark yet he wa not so firmli
seat on the throne that he dare put awai our word for still there
were mani in the land who love the memori of chaka and rememb that
dingaan had murder him and umhlangana also for now that chaka wa
dead peopl forgot how evilli he had dealt with them and rememb
onli that he wa a great man who had made the zulu peopl out of
noth as a smith fashion a bright spear from a lump of iron also
though thei had chang master yet their burden wa not lessen
for as chaka slew so dingaan slew also and as chaka oppress so did
dingaan oppress therefor dingaan yield to the voic of hi induna
and no impi wa sent against the halakazi to seek the maid that wa
name the lili but still he hanker for her in hi heart and from
that hour he hate me becaus i had cross hi will and rob him of
hi desir
now my father there is thi to be told though i did not know it then
the maid who wa name the lili wa no other than my daughter nada the
thought inde came into my mind that none but nada could be so fair
yet i knew for certain that nada and her mother macropha were dead for
he who brought me the new of their death had seen their bodi lock
in each other arm kill as it were by the same spear yet as
it chanc he wa wrong for though macropha inde wa kill it wa
anoth maid who lai in blood besid her for the peopl whither i had
sent macropha and nada were tributari to the halakazi tribe and that
chief of the halakazi who sat in the place of galazi the wolf had
quarrel with them and fallen on them by night and eaten them up
as i learn afterward the caus of their destruct as in later
dai it wa the caus of the slai of the halakazi wa the beauti of
nada and noth els for the fame of her loveli had gone about
the land and the old chief of the halakazi had command that the girl
should be sent to hi kraal to live there that her beauti might shine
upon hi place like the sun and that if so she will she should
choos a husband from the great men of the halakazi but the headmen
of the kraal refus for none who had look on her would suffer their
ey to lose sight of nada the lili though there wa thi fate about
the maid that none strove to wed her against her will mani inde
ask her in marriag both there and among the halakazi peopl but
ever she shook her head and said nai i would wed no man and it wa
enough
for it wa the sai among men that it wa better that she should
remain unmarri and all should look on her than that she should pass
from their sight into the hous of a husband sinc thei held that her
beauti wa given to be a joi to all like the beauti of the dawn and
of the even yet thi beauti of nada wa a dread thing and the
mother of much death as shall be told and becaus of her beauti and
the great love she bore she the lili herself must wither and the
cup of my sorrow must be fill to overflow and the heart of
umslopogaa the slaughter son of chaka the king must becom desol
as the black plain when fire ha swept it so it wa ordain my
father and so it befel see that thu all men white and black
seek that which is beauti and when at last thei find it then it
pass swiftli awai or perchanc it is their death for great joi and
great beauti ar wing nor will thei sojourn long upon the earth thei
come down like eagl out of the sky and into the sky thei return again
swiftli
thu then it came about my father that i mopo believ my daughter
nada to be dead littl guess that it wa she who wa name the lili
in the kraal of the halakazi and whom dingaan the king desir for a
wife
now after i had thwart him in thi matter of the send of an impi to
pluck the lili from the garden of the halakazi dingaan learn to hate
me also i wa in hi secret and with me he had kill hi brother
chaka and hi brother umhlangana and it wa i who held him back from
the slai of hi brother panda also and therefor he hate me as
is the fashion of smallheart men with those who have lift them up
yet he did not dare to do awai with me for my voic wa loud in the
land and when i spoke the peopl listen therefor in the end he
cast about for some wai to be rid of me for a while till he should grow
strong enough to kill me
mopo said the king to me on dai as i sat befor him in council with
other of the induna and gener mindest thou of the last word
of the great eleph who is dead thi he said mean chaka hi
brother onli he did not name him for now the name of chaka wa blonipa
in the land as is the custom with the name of dead kingsthat is my
father it wa not law that it should pass the lip
i rememb the word o king i answer thei were omin word
for thi wa their burden that you and your hous should not sit long
in the throne of king but that the white men should take awai your
royalti and divid your territori such wa the propheci of the lion
of the zulu why speak of it onc befor i heard him propheci and hi
word were fulfil mai the omen be an egg without meat mai it never
becom fledg mai that bird never perch upon your roof o king
now dingaan trembl with fear for the word of chaka were in hi mind
by night and by dai then he grew angri and bit hi lip sai
thou fool mopo canst thou not hear a raven croak at the gate of a
kraal but thou must need go tell those who dwell within that he wait
to pick their ey such crier of ill to come mai well find ill at
hand mopo he ceas look on me threateningli awhil and went on
i did not speak of those word roll by chanc from a tongu half
loos by death but of other that told of a certain bulalio of a
slaughter who rule the peopl of the ax and dwell beneath the
shadow of the ghost mountain far awai to the north yonder sure i
heard them all as i sat beneath the shade of the reedfenc befor ever
i came to save him who wa my brother from the spear of masilo the
murder whose spear stole awai the life of a king
i rememb those word also o king i said is it the will of the
king that an impi should be gather to eat up thi upstart such wa
the command of the on who is gone given as it were with hi last
breath
nai mopo that is not my will if no impi can be found by thee to wipe
awai the halakazi and bring on whom i desir to delight my ey then
sure none can be found to eat up thi slaughter and hi peopl
moreov bulalio chief of the peopl of the ax ha not offend
against me but against an eleph whose trumpet ar done now thi
is my will mopo my servant that thou shouldst take with thee a few
men onli and go gentli to thi bulalio and sai to him a greater
eleph stalk through the land than he who ha gone to sleep and it
ha come to hi earsthat thou chief of the peopl of the ax dost
pai no tribut and hast said that becaus of the death of a certain
mopo thou wilt have noth to do with him whose shadow li upon the
land now on mopo is sent to thee slaughter to know if thi tale is
true for if it be true then shalt thou learn the weight of the hoof
of that eleph who trumpet in the kraal of umgugundhlovu think
then and weigh thy word befor thou dost answer slaughter
now i mopo heard the command of the king and ponder them in my
mind for i knew well that it wa the design of dingaan to be rid of me
for a space that he might find time to plot my overthrow and that he
care littl for thi matter of a petti chief who live far awai had
dare to defi chaka yet i wish to go for there had arisen in me a
great desir to see thi bulalio who spoke of vengeanc to be taken for
on mopo and whose deed were such as the deed of umslopogaa would
have been had umslopogaa live to look upon the light therefor i
answer
i hear the king the king word shall be done though o king thou
sendest a big man upon a littl errand
not so mopo answer dingaan my heart tell me that thi chicken
of a slaughter will grow to a great cock if hi comb is not cut
present and thou mopo art vers in cut comb even of the
tallest
i hear the king i answer again
so my father it came about that on the morrow take with me but ten
chosen men i mopo start on my journei toward the ghost mountain
and as i journei i thought much of how i had trod that path in bygon
dai then macropha my wife and nada my daughter and umslopogaa
the son of chaka who wa thought to be my son walk at my side now
as i imagin all were dead and i walk alon doubtless i also should
soon be dead well peopl live few dai and evil in those time and
what did it matter at the least i had wreak vengeanc on chaka and
satisfi my heart
at length i came on night to that lone spot where we had camp in
the evil hour when umslopogaa wa born awai by the lioness and onc
more i look upon the cave whenc he had drag the cub and upon the
aw face of the stone witch who sit aloft upon the ghost mountain
forev and forev i could sleep littl that night becaus of the
sorrow at my heart but sat awak look in the bright of the
moon upon the grei face of the stone witch and on the depth of the
forest that grew about her knee wonder the while if the bone of
umslopogaa lai broken in that forest now as i journei mani tale
had been told to me of thi ghost mountain which all swore wa haunt
so said some by men in the shape of wolv and so said some by the
esemkofuthat is by men who have di and who have been brought back
again by magic thei have no tongu the esemkofu for had thei
tongu thei would cry aloud to mortal the aw secret of the dead
therefor thei can but utter a wail like that of a babe sure on
mai hear them in the forest at night as thei wail aiah aiah
among the silent tree
you laugh my father but i did not laugh as i thought of these tale
for if men have spirit where do the spirit go when the bodi is dead
thei must go somewher and would it be strang that thei should return
to look upon the land where thei were born yet i never thought much
of such matter though i am a doctor and know someth of the wai
of the amatongo the peopl of the ghost to speak truth my father
i have had so much to do with the loos of the spirit of men that i
never troubl myself overmuch with them after thei were loos there
will be time to do thi when i myself am of their number
so i sat and gaze on the mountain and the forest that grew over it like
hair on the head of a woman and as i gaze i heard a sound that came
from far awai out of the heart of the forest as it seem at first
it wa faint and far off a distant thing like the cry of children in
a kraal across a vallei then it grew louder but still i could not sai
what it might be now it swell and swell and i knew itit wa the
sound of wild beat at chase nearer came the music the rock rang with
it and it voic set the blood beat but to hearken to it that pack
wa great which ran ahunt through the silent night and now it wa
night on the other side of the slope onli and the sound swell so
loud that those who were with me awok also and look forth now of a
sudden a great koodoo bull appear for an instant stand out against
the sky on the crest of the ridg then vanish in the shadow he wa
run toward us present we saw him again speed on hi path with
great bound we saw thi alsoform grei and gaunt and gallop in
number countless that leap along hi path appear on the crest of
the rise disappear into the shadow seen again on the slope lost in
the vallei and with them two other shape the shape of men
now the big buck bound past us not half a spear throw awai and
behind him stream the countless wolv and from the throat of the
wolv went up that aw music and who were these two that came with
the wolv shape of men great and strong thei ran silent and swift
wolv teeth gleam upon their head wolv hide hung about their
shoulder in the hand of on wa an axeth moonlight shone upon
itin the hand of the other a heavi club neck and neck thei ran never
befor had we seen men travel so fast see thei sped down the slope
toward us the wolv were left behind all except four of them we
heard the beat of their feet thei came thei pass thei were gone
and with them their unnumb compani the music grew faint it di
it wa dead the hunt wa far awai and the night wa still again
now my brethren i ask of those who were with me what is thi
that we have seen
then on answer we have seen the ghost who live in the lap of the
old witch and those men ar the wolfbrethren the wizard who ar
king of the ghost
chapter xxiii mopo reveal himself to the slaughter
all that night we watch but we neither saw nor heard ani more of the
wolv nor of the men who hunt with them on the morrow at dawn i
sent a runner to bulalio chief of the peopl of the ax sai that a
messeng came to him from dingaan the king who desir to speak with
him in peac within the gate of hi kraal i charg the messeng
howev that he should not tell my name but should sai onli that it
wa mouth of dingaan then i and those with me follow slowli on the
path of the man whom i sent forward for the wai wa still far and i
had bidden him return and meet me bear the word of the slaughter
holder of the ax
all that dai till the sun grew low we talk round the base of the great
ghost mountain follow the line of the river we met no on but onc
we came to the ruin of a kraal and in it lai the broken bone of
mani men and with the bone rusti assegai and the remain of oxhid
shield black and white in colour now i examin the shield and
knew from their colour that thei had been carri in the hand of those
soldier who year ago were sent out by chaka to seek for umslopogaa
but who had return no more
now i said it ha fare ill with those soldier of the black on
who is gone for i think that these ar the shield thei bore and
that their ey onc look upon the world through the hole in yonder
skull
these ar the shield thei bore and those ar the skull thei wore
answer on see mopo son of makedama thi is no man work that
ha brought them to their death men do not break the bone of their
foe in piec as these bone ar broken wow men do not break them
but wolv do and last night we saw wolv ahunt nor did thei hunt
alon mopo wow thi is a haunt land
then we went on in silenc and all the wai the stone face of the witch
who sit aloft forev stare down on us from the mountain top at
length an hour befor sundown we came to the open land and there on
the crest of a rise beyond the river we saw the kraal of the peopl
of the ax it wa a great kraal and well built and their cattl were
spread about the plain like to herd of game for number we went to
the river and pass it by the ford then sat down and wait till
present i saw the man whom i had sent forward return toward us he
came and salut me and i ask him for new
thi is my new mopo he said i have seen him who is name bulalio
and he is a great manlong and lean with a fierc face and carri
a mighti ax such an ax as he bore last night who hunt with the
wolv when i had been led befor the chief i salut him and spoke to
himth word you laid upon my tongu i told to him he listen
then laugh aloud and said tell him who sent you that the mouth of
dingaan shall be welcom and shall speak the word of dingaan in peac
yet i would that it were the head of dingaan that came and not hi mouth
onli for then ax groanmak would join in our talkai becaus of
on mopo whom hi brother chaka murder it would also speak with
dingaan still the mouth is not the head so the mouth mai come in
peac
now i start when for the second time i heard talk of on mopo whose
name had been on the lip of bulalio the slaughter who wa there
that would thu have love mopo except on who wa long dead and yet
perhap the chief spoke of some other mopo for the name wa not my
own onlyin truth chaka had kill a chief of that name at the great
mourn becaus he said that two mopo in the land were on too mani
and that though thi mopo wept sore when the tear of other were dry
so i said onli that thi bulalio had a high stomach and we went on to
the gate of the kraal
there were none to meet us at the gate and none stood by the door of
the hut within them but beyond from the cattl kraal that wa in the
centr of the hut rose a dust and a din as of men gather for war
now some of those were with me were afraid and would have turn back
fear treacheri and thei were yet more afraid when on come to the
inner entranc of the cattl kraal we saw some five hundr soldier
be muster there compani by compani by two great men who ran up
and down the rank shout
but i cri nai nai turn not back bold look melt the heart of
foe moreov if thi bulalio would have murder us there wa no
need for him to call up so mani of hi warrior he is a proud chief
and would show hi might not know that the king we serv can muster
a compani for everi man he ha let us go on boldli
so we walk forward toward the impi that wa gather on the further
side of the kraal now the two great men who were marshal the
soldier saw us and came to meet us on follow the other he who
came first bore the ax upon hi shoulder and he who follow swung
a huge club i look upon the foremost of them and ah my father
my heart grew faint with joi for i knew him across the year it wa
umslopogaa my fosterl umslopogaa and none other now grown
into manhoodai into such a man as wa not to be found besid him in
zululand he wa great and fierc somewhat spare in frame but wide
shoulder and shallow flank hi arm were long and not over big but
the muscl stood out on them like knot in a rope hi leg were long
also and veri thick beneath the knee hi ey wa like an eagl hi
nose somewhat hook and he held hi head a littl forward as a man
who search continu for a hidden foe he seem to walk slowli and
yet he came swiftli but with a glide movement like that of a wolf or
a lion and alwai hi finger plai round the horn handl of the ax
groanmak as for him who follow he wa great also shorter than
umslopogaa by the half of a head but of a sturdier build hi ey
were small and twinkl unceasingli like littl star and hi look wa
veri wild for now and again he grin show hi white teeth
when i saw umslopogaa my father my bowel melt within me and i
long to run to him and throw myself upon hi neck yet i took council
with myself and did notnai i drop the corner of the kaross i wrote
over my ey hide my face lest he should know me present he stood
befor me search me out with hi keen ey for i drew forward to
greet him
greet mouth of dingaan he said in a loud voic you ar a littl
man to be the mouth of so big a chief
the mouth is a littl member even of the bodi of a great king o chief
bulalio ruler of the peopl of the ax wizard of the wolv that ar
upon the ghost mountain who aforetim wa name umslopogaa son of
mopo son of makedama
now when umslopogaa heard these word he start like a child at a
rustl in the dark and stare hard at me
you ar well instruct he said
the ear of the king ar larg if hi mouth be small o chief
bulalio i answer and i who am but the mouth speak what the ear
have heard
how know you that i have dwelt with the wolv upon the ghost mountain
o mouth he ask
the ey of the king see far o chief bulalio thu last night thei saw
a great chase and a merri it seem that thei saw a koodoo bull run
at speed and after him countless wolv make their music and with
the wolv two men clad in wolv skin such men as you bulalio and
he with the club who follow you
now umslopogaa lift the ax groanmak as though he would cut me
down then let it fall again while galazi the wolf glare at me with
wideopen ey
how know you that onc i wa name umslopogaa who have lost that name
these mani dai speak o mouth lest i kill you
slai if you will umslopogaa i answer but know that when the
brain ar scatter the mouth is dumb he who scatter brain lose
wisdom
answer he said

hi kraal is stamp flat and that is why i hate the black on and
therefor i hate dingaan hi brother and will be as ar mopo and the
hous of mopo befor i pai him tribut of a singl ox
all thi while i had spoken to umslopogaa in a feign voic my
father but now i spoke again and in my own voic sai
so now you speak from your heart young man and by dig i have
reach the root of the matter it is becaus of thi dead dog of a mopo
that you defi the king
umslopogaa heard the voic and trembl no more with anger but rather
with fear and wonder he look at me hard answer noth
have you a hut near by o chief bulalio foe of dingaan the king where
i the mouth of the king mai speak with you a while apart for i would
learn your messag word by word that i mai deliv it without fault
fear not slaughter to sit alon with me in an empti hut i am
unarm and old and there is that in your hand which i should fear
and i point to the ax
now umslopogaa still shake in hi limb answer follow me o
mouth and you galazi stai with these men
so i follow umslopogaa and present we came to a larg hut he
point to the doorwai and i crept through it and he follow after
me now for a while it seem dark in the hut for the sun wa sink
without and the place wa full of shadow so i wait while a man might
count fifti till our ey could search the dark then of a sudden i
threw the blanket from my face and look into the ye of umslopogaa
look on me now o chief bulalio o slaughter who onc wa name
umslopogaaslook on me and sai who am i then he look at me and hi
jaw fell
either you ar mopo my father grown oldmopo who is dead or the
ghost of mopo he answer in a low voic
i am mopo your father umslopogaa i said you have been long in
know me who knew you from the first
then umslopogaa cri aloud but yet softli and let fall the ax
groanmak he flung himself upon my breast and wept there and i wept
also
oh my father he said i thought that you were dead with the other
and now you have come back to me and i i would have lift the ax
against you in my folli oh it is well that i have live and not di
sinc onc more i look upon your faceth face that i thought dead
but which yet live though it be sore chang as though by grief and
year
peac umslopogaa my son i said i also deem you dead in the
lion mouth though in truth it seem strang to me that ani other man
than umslopogaa could have wrought the deed which i have heard of as
done by bulalio chief of the peopl of the axeai and thrown defianc
in the teeth of chaka but you ar not dead and i i am not dead it
wa anoth mopo whom chaka kill i slew chaka chaka did not slai
me
and of nada what of nada my sister he said
macropha your mother and nada your sister ar dead umslopogaa
thei ar dead at the hand of the peopl of the halakazi who dwell in
swaziland
i have heard of that peopl he answer present and so ha galazi
the wolf yonder he ha a hate to satisfi against themthei murder
hi father now i have two for thei have murder my mother and my
sister ah nada my sister nada my sister and the great man cover
hi face with hi hand and rock himself to and fro in hi grief
now my father it came into my thought to make the truth plain to
umslopogaa and tell him that nada wa no sister of hi and that he
wa no son of mine but rather of that chaka whom my hand had finish
and yet i did not though now i would that i had done so for i saw well
how great wa the pride and how high wa the heart of umslopogaa and
i saw also that if onc he should learn that the throne of zululand wa
hi by right noth could hold him back for he would swiftli break
into open rebellion against dingaan the king and in my judgment the
time wa not ripe for that had i known inde but on short year
befor that umslopogaa still live he had sat where dingaan sat thi
dai but i did not know it and the chanc had gone by for a while now
dingaan wa king and muster mani regiment about him for i had held
him back from war as in the case of the raid that he wish to make
upon the swazi the chanc had gone by but it would come again and
till it came i must sai noth i would do thi rather i would bring
dingaan and umslopogaa togeth that umslopogaa might becom known in
the land as a great chief and the first of warrior then i would caus
him to be advanc to be an induna and a gener readi to lead the
impi of the king for he who lead the impi is alreadi half a king
so i held my peac upon thi matter but till the dawn wa grei
umslopogaa and i sat togeth and talk each tell the tale of
those year that had gone sinc he wa born from me in the lion
mouth i told him how all my wive and children had been kill how i
had been put to the torment and show him my white and wither hand
i told him also of the death of baleka my sister and of all my peopl
of the langeni and of how i had reveng my wrong upon chaka and made
dingaan to be king in hi place and wa now the first man in the land
under the king though the king fear me much and love me littl but
i did not tell him that baleka my sister wa hi own mother
when i had done my tale umslopogaa told me hi how galazi had rescu
him from the lioness how he becam on of the wolfbrethren how he had
conquer jikiza and the son of jikiza and becom chief of the peopl
of the ax and taken zinita to wife and grown great in the land
i ask him how it came about that he still hunt with the wolv as
he had done last night he answer that now he wa great and there wa
noth more to win and at time a weari of life came upon him
and then he must up and togeth with galazi hunt and harri with the
wolv for thu onli could he find rest
i said that i would show him better game to hunt befor all wa done
and ask him further if he love hi wife zinita umslopogaa answer
that he would love her better if she love him not so much for she wa
jealou and quick to anger and that wa a sorrow to him then when
he had slept awhil he led me from the hut and i and my peopl were
feast with the best and i spoke with zinita and with galazi the wolf
for the last i like him well thi wa a good man to have at on
back in battl but my heart spoke to me against zinita she
wa handsom and tall but with fierc ey which alwai watch
umslopogaa my fosterl and i note that he who wa fearless of all
other thing yet seem to fear zinita neither did she love me for
when she saw how the slaughter clung to me as it wee instantli she
grew jealousa alreadi she wa jealou of galaziand would have been
rid of me if she might thu it came about that my heart spoke against
zinita nor did it tell me wors thing of her than those which she wa
to do
chapter xxiv the slai of the boer
on the morrow i led umslopogaa apart and spoke to him thu
my son yesterdai when you did not know me except as the mouth of
dingaan you charg me with a certain messag for dingaan the king
that had it been deliv into the ear of the king had sure
brought death upon you and all your peopl the tree that stand by
itself on a plain umslopogaa think itself tall and that there is no
shade to equal it shade yet ar there other and bigger tree you ar
such a solitari tree umslopogaa but the topmost branch of him whom
i serv ar thicker than your trunk and beneath hi shadow live mani
woodcutt who go out to lop those that would grow too high you ar
no match for dingaan though dwell here alon in an empti land you
have grown great in your own ey and in the ey of those about you
moreov umslopogaa know thi dingaan alreadi hate you becaus of
the word which in bygon year you sent by masilo the fool to the black
on who is dead for he heard those word and it is hi will to eat you
up he ha sent me hither for on reason onli to be rid of me awhil
and whatev the word i bring back to him the end will be the
samethat night shall come when you will find an impi at your gate
then what need to talk more of the matter my father ask
umslopogaa that will come which must come let me wait here for the
impi of dingaan and fight till i do
not so umslopogaa my son there ar more wai of kill a man than
by the assegai and a crook stick can still be bent straight in the
stream it is my desir umslopogaa that instead of hate dingaan
should give you love instead of death advanc and that you shall
grow great in hi shadow listen dingaan is not what chaka wa though
like chaka he is cruel thi dingaan is a fool and it mai well come
about that a man can be found who grow up in hi shadow in the end
shall overshadow him i might do iti myself but i am old and
be worn with sorrow have no long to rule but you ar young
umslopogaa and there is no man like you in the land moreov there
ar other matter of which it is not well to speak that shall serv you
as a raft whereon to swim to power
now umslopogaa glanc up sharpli for in those dai he wa ambiti
and desir to be first among the peopl inde have the blood of
chaka in hi vein how could it be otherwis
what is your plan my father he ask sai how can thi be brought
about
thi and thu umslopogaa among the tribe of the halakazi in
swaziland there dwell a maid who is name the lili she is a girl of
the most wonder beauti and dingaan is afir with long to have her
to wife now awhil sinc dingaan dispatch an embassi to the chief of
the halakazi ask the lili in marriag and the chief of the halakazi
sent back insol word sai that the beauti of the earth should
be given to no zulu dog as a wife then dingaan wa angri and he would
have gather hi impi and sent them against the halakazi to destroi
them and bring him the maid but i held him back from it sai
that now wa no time to begin a new war and it is for thi caus that
dingaan hate me he is so set upon the pluck of the swazi lili do
you understand now umslopogaa
someth he answer but speak clearli
wow umslopogaa half word ar better than whole on in thi land
of our listen then thi is my plan that you should fall upon the
halakazi tribe destroi it and bring back the maid as a peaceoff
to dingaan
that is a good plan my father he answer at the least maid or
no maid there will be fight in it and cattl to divid when the
fight is done
first conquer then reckon up the spoil umslopogaa
now he thought awhil then said suffer that i summon galazi the wolf
my captain do not fear he is trusti and a man of few word
present galazi came and sat down befor us then i put the matter to
him thu that umslopogaa would fall upon the halakazi and bring to
dingaan the maid he long for as a peaceoff but that i wish
to hold him back from the ventur becaus the halakazi peopl were great
and strong i spoke in thi sens so that i might have a door to creep
out should galazi betrai the plot and umslopogaa read my purpos
though my craft wa needless for galazi wa a true man
galazi the wolf listen in silenc till i had finish then he
answer quietli but it seem to me that a fire shone in hi ey as
he spoke
i am chief by right of the halakazi o mouth of dingaan and know them
well thei ar a strong peopl and can put two full regiment under
arm wherea bulalio here can muster but on regiment and that a
small on moreov thei have watchmen out by night and dai and
spi scatter through the land so that it will be hard to take them
unawar also their stronghold is a vast cave open to the sky in the
middl and none have won that stronghold yet nor could it be found
except by those who know it secret thei ar few yet i am on of them
for my father show it to me when i wa a lad therefor mouth of
dingaan you will know that thi is no easi task which bulalio would set
himself and usto conquer the halakazi that is the face of the matter
so far as it concern bulalio but for me o mouth it ha anoth face
know that long year ago i swore to my father as he lai dy by
the poison of a witch of thi peopl that i would not rest till i had
aveng himai till i had stamp out the halakazi and slain their
men and brought their women to the hous of stranger and their
children to bond year by year and month by month and night by night
as i have lain alon upon the ghost mountain yonder i have wonder how
i might bring my oath to pass and found no wai now it seem that there
is a wai and i am glad yet thi is a great adventur and perhap
befor it is done with the peopl of the ax will be no more and he
ceas and took snuff watch our face over the spoon
galazi the wolf said umslopogaa for me also the matter ha anoth
face you have lost your father at the hand of these halakazi dog
and though till last night i did not know it i have lost my mother by
their spear and with her on whom i love abov all in the world
my sister nada who love me also both ar dead and the halakazi have
kill them thi man the mouth of dingaan and he point to me
mopo thi man sai that if i can stamp out the halakazi and make
captiv of the lili maid i shall win the heart of dingaan littl do
i care for dingaan i who would go my wai alon and live while i
mai live and die when i must by the hand of dingaan as by those of
anotherwhat doe it matter yet for thi reason becaus of the death
of macropha my mother and nada the sister who wa dear to me i will
make war upon these halakazi and conquer them or be conquer by them
perhap o mouth of dingaan you will see me soon at the king kraal
on the mahlabatin and with me the lili maid and the cattl of the
halakazi or perhap you shall not see me and then you will know that i
am dead and the warrior of the ax ar no more
so umslopogaa spoke to me befor galazi the wolf but afterward he
embrac me and bade me farewel for he had no great hope that we
should meet again and i also doubt it for as galazi said the
adventur wa great yet as i had seen mani time it is the bold
thrower who oftenest win so we partedi to return to dingaan and tell
him that bulalio chief of the peopl of the ax had gone up against
the halakazi to win the lili maid and bring her to him in aton
while umslopogaa remain to make readi hi impi for war
i went swiftli from the ghost mountain back to the kraal umgugundhlovu
and present myself befor dingaan who at first look on me coldli
but when i told him my messag and how that the chief bulalio the
slaughter had taken the warpath to win him the lili hi manner
chang he took me by the hand and said that i had done well and he
had been foolish to doubt me when i lift up my voic to persuad him
from send an impi against the halakazi now he saw that it wa my
purpos to rake thi halakazi fire with anoth hand than hi and to
save hi hand from the burn and he thank me
moreov he said that if thi chief of the peopl of the ax brought
him the maid hi heart desir not onli would he forgiv him the word
he had spoken by the mouth of masilo to the black on who wa dead but
also all the cattl of the halakazi should be hi and he would make him
great in the land i answer that all thi wa as the king will i
had but done my duti by the king and work so that whatev befel a
proud chief should be weaken and a foe should be attack at no cost
to the king in such fashion also that perhap it might come about that
the king would shortli have the lili at hi side
then i sat down to wait what might befal
now it is my father that the white men come into my stori whom we
name the amaboona but you call the boer ou i think ill of those
amaboona though it wa i who gave them the victori over dingaani and
umslopogaa
befor thi time inde a few white men had come to and fro to the
kraal of chaka and dingaan but these came to prai and not to fight
now the boer both fight and prai also thei steal or us to steal
which i do not understand for the prayer of you white men sai that
these thing should not be done
well when i had been back from the ghost mountain someth less than a
moon the boer came sixti of them command by a captain name
retief a big man and arm with roersth long gun thei had in
those daysor perhap thei number a hundr in all count their
servant and afterrid thi wa their purpos to get a grant of
the land in natal that li between the tugela and the umzimoubu river
but by my council and that of other induna dingaan bargain with
the boer that first thei should attack a certain chief name sigomyela
who had stolen some of the king cattl and who live near the
quathlamba mountain and bring back those cattl thi the boer agre
to and went to attack the chief and in a littl while thei came back
again have destroi the peopl of sigomyela and drive hi cattl
befor them as well as those which had been stolen from the king
the face of dingaan shone when he saw the cattl and that night he
call us the council of the amapakati togeth and ask us as
to the grant of the countri i spoke the first and said that it
matter littl if he grant it see that the black on who wa dead
had alreadi given it to the english the peopl of georg and the end
of the matter would be that the amaboona and the peopl of georg would
fight for the land yet the word of the black on were come to pass
for alreadi it seem we could hear the sound of the run of a white
folk who should eat up the kingdom
now when i had spoken thu the heart of dingaan grew heavi and hi face
dark for my word stuck in hi breast like a barb spear still he
made no answer but dismiss the council
on the morrow the king promis to sign the paper give the land thei
ask for to the boer and all wa smooth as water when there is no
wind befor the paper wa sign the king gave a great danc for there
were mani regiment gather at the kraal and for three dai thi danc
went on but on the third dai he dismiss the regiment all except
on an impi of lad who were command to stai now all thi while
i wonder what wa in the mind of dingaan and wa afraid for the
amaboona but he wa secret and told noth except to the captain of
the regiment aloneno not even to on of hi council yet i knew that
he plan evil and wa half inclin to warn the captain retief but
did not fear to make myself foolish ah my father if i had spoken
how mani would have live who were soon dead but what doe it matter
in ani case most of them would have been dead by now
on the fourth morn earli dingaan sent a messeng to the boer
bid them meet him in the cattl kraal for there he would mark the
paper so thei came stack their gun at the gate of the kraal
for it wa death for ani man white or black to come arm befor the
presenc of the king now my father the kraal umgugundhlovu wa built
in a great circl after the fashion of royal kraal first came the
high outer fenc then the thousand of hut that ran three part round
between the great fenc and the inner on within thi inner fenc wa
the larg open space big enough to hold five regiment and at the top
of itopposit the entrancestood the cattl kraal itself that cut
off a piec of the open space by anoth fenc bent like a bow behind
thi again were the emposeni the place of the king women the
guardhous the labyrinth and the intunkulu the hous of the king
dingaan came out on that dai and sat on a stool in front of the cattl
kraal and by him stood a man hold a shield over hi head to keep
the sun from him also we of the amapakati the council were there and
rang round the fenc of the space arm with short stick onlynot
with kerri my fatherwa that regiment of young men which dingaan
had not sent awai the captain of the regiment be station near to
the king on the right
present the boer came in on foot and walk up to the king in a
bodi and dingaan greet them kindli and shook hand with retief their
captain then retief drew the paper from a leather pouch which set out
the boundari of the grant of land and it wa translat to the king
by an interpret dingaan said that it wa good and put hi mark upon
it and retief and all the boer were pleas and smile across their
face now thei would have said farewel but dingaan forbad them
sai that thei must not go yet first thei must eat and see the
soldier danc a littl and he command dish of boil flesh which
had been made readi and bowl of milk to be brought to them the boer
said that thei had alreadi eaten still thei drank the milk pass
the bowl from hand to hand
now the regiment began to danc sing the ingomo that is the war
chant of us zulu my father and the boer drew back toward the centr
of the space to give the soldier room to danc in it wa at thi
moment that i heard dingaan give an order to a messeng to run swiftli
to the white doctor of prayer who wa stai without the kraal
tell him not to be afraid and i wonder what thi might mean for
why should the prayer doctor fear a danc such as he had often seen
befor present dingaan rose and follow by all walk through the
press to where the captain retief stood and bade him goodby shake
him by the hand and bid him hambla gachl to go in peac then he
turn and walk back again toward the gatewai which led to hi
royal hous and i saw that near thi entranc stood the captain of the
regiment as on stand by who wait for order
now of a sudden my father dingaan stop and cri with a loud
voic bulalani abatakati slai the wizard and have cri it he
cover hi face with the corner of hi blanket and pass behind the
fenc
we the councillor stood astound like men who had becom stone but
befor we could speak or act the captain of the regiment had also cri
aloud bulalani abatakati and the signal wa caught up from everi
side then my father came a yell and a rush of thousand of feet and
through the cloud of dust we saw the soldier hurl themselv upon the
amaboona and abov the shout we heard the sound of fall stick
the amaboona drew their knive and fought brave but befor a man
could count a hundr twice it wa done and thei were be drag
some few dead but the most yet live toward the gate of the
kraal and out on to the hill of slaughter and there on the hill of
slaughter thei were massacr everi on of them how ah i will not
tell youthei were massacr and pile in a heap and that wa the end
of their stori my father
now i and the other councillor turn awai and walk silent toward
the hous of the king we found him stand befor hi great hut
and lift our hand we salut him silent sai no word it
wa dingaan who spoke laugh a littl as he spoke like a man who is
uneasi in hi mind
ah my captain he said when the vultur plume themselv thi
morn and shriek to the sky for blood thei did not look for such a
feast as i have given them and you my captain you littl guess how
great a king the heaven have set to rule over you nor how deep is the
mind of the king that watch ever over hi peopl welfar now the
land is free from the white wizard of whose footstep the black on
croak as he gave up hi life or soon shall be for thi is but a
begin ho messeng and he turn to some men who stood behind
him awai swiftli to the regiment that ar gather behind the
mountain awai to them bear the king word to the captain thi
is the king word that the impi shall run to the land of natal and
slai the boer there wipe them out man woman and child awai
now the messeng cri out the royal salut of bayet and leap
forward like spear from the hand of the thrower were gone at onc but
we the councillor the member of the amapakati still stood silent
then dingaan spoke again address me
is thy heart at rest now mopo son of makedama ever hast thou bleat
in my ear of thi white peopl and of the deed that thei shall do and
lo i have blown upon them with my breath and thei ar gone sai mopo
ar the amaboona wizard yonder all dead if ani be left aliv i desir
to speak with on of them
then i look dingaan in the face and spoke
thei ar all dead and thou o king thou also art dead
it were well for thee thou dog said dingaan that thou shouldst
make thy mean plain
let the king pardon me i answer thi is my mean thou canst
not kill thi white men for thei ar not of on race but of mani
race and the sea is their home thei rise out of the black water
destroi those that ar here and other shall come to aveng them more
and more and more now thou hast smitten in thy hour in their thei
shall smite in turn now thei lie low in blood at thy hand in a dai to
come o king thou shalt lie low in blood at their mad ha taken
hold of thee o king that thou hast done thi thing and the fruit
of thy mad shall be thy death i have spoken i who am the king
servant let the will of the king be done
then i stood still wait to be kill for my father in the furi of
my heart at the wicked which had been work i could not hold back
my word thrice dingaan look on me with a terribl face and yet
there wa fear in hi face strive with it rage and i wait calmli
to see which would conquer the fear or the rage when at last he spoke
it wa on word go not three word take him awai so i went yet
live and with me the councillor leav the king alon
i went with a heavi heart my father for of all the evil sight that i
have seen it seem to me that thi wa the most evilthat the amaboona
should be slaughter thu treacher and that the impi should be
sent out treacher to murder those who were left of them togeth
with their women and children ay and thei slewsix hundr of them
did thei slayyond in weenen the land of weep
sai my father why doe the umkulunkulu who sit in the heaven abov
allow such thing to be done on the earth beneath i have heard the
preach of the white men and thei sai that thei know all about
himthat hi name ar power and merci and love why then doe he
suffer these thing to be donewhi doe he suffer such men as chaka and
dingaan to torment the peopl of the earth and in the end pai them but
on death for all the thousand that thei have given to other becaus
of the wicked of the peopl you sai but no no that cannot be
for do not the guiltless go with the guiltyai do not the innoc
children perish by the hundr perchanc there is anoth answer
though who am i my father that i in my folli should strive to search
out the wai of the unsearch perchanc it is but a part of the great
plan a littl piec of that pattern of which i spoketh pattern on
the cup that hold the water of hi wisdom wow i do not understand
who am but a wild man nor have i found more knowledg in the heart of
you tame white peopl you know mani thing but of these you do not
know you cannot tell us what we were an hour befor birth nor what we
shall be an hour after death nor why we were born nor why we die you
can onli hope and believethat is all and perhap my father befor
mani dai ar sped i shall be wiser than all of you for i am veri ag
the fire of my life sink lowit burn in my brain alon there it is
still bright but soon that will go out also and then perhap i shall
understand
chapter xxv the war with the halakazi peopl
now my father i must tell of how umslopogaa the slaughter and
galazi the wolf fare in their war against the peopl of the halakazi
when i had gone from the shadow of the ghost mountain umslopogaa
summon a gather of all hi headmen and told them it wa hi desir
that the peopl of the ax should no longer be a littl peopl that
thei should grow great and number their cattl by ten of thousand
the headmen ask how thi might be brought aboutwould he then make
war on dingaan the king umslopogaa answer no he would win the
favour of the king thu and he told them of the lili maid and of the
halakazi tribe in swaziland and of how he would go up against that
tribe now some of the headmen said yea to thi and some said nai and
the talk ran high and last till the even but when the even wa
come umslopogaa rose and said that he wa chief under the ax and none
other and it wa hi will that thei should go up against the halakazi
if there wa ani man there who would gainsai hi will let him stand
forward and do battl with him and he who conquer should order all
thing to thi there wa no answer for there were few who care to
face the beak of groanmak and so it came about that it wa agre
that the peopl of the ax should make war upon the halakazi and
umslopogaa sent out messeng to summon everi fightingman to hi
side
but when zinita hi head wife came to hear of the matter she wa
angri and upbraid umslopogaa and heap curs on me mopo whom
she knew onli as the mouth of dingaan becaus as she said truli i had
put thi scheme into the mind of the slaughter what she went on
do you not live here in peac and plenti and must you go to make war
on those who have not harm you there perhap to perish or to come
to other ill you sai you do thi to win a girl for dingaan and to find
favour in hi sight ha not dingaan girl more than he can count it
is more like that weari of us your wive you go to get girl for
yourself bulalio and as for find favour rest quiet so shall you
find most favour if the king send hi impi against you then it will
be time to fight o fool with littl wit
thu zinita spoke to him veri roughlyfor she alwai blurt out what
wa in her mind and umslopogaa could not challeng her to battl so
he must bear her talk as best he might for it is often thu my father
that the greatest of men grow small enough in their own hut moreov
he knew that it wa becaus zinita love him that she spoke so bitterli
now on the third dai all the fightingmen were gather and there might
have been two thousand of them good men and brave then umslopogaa
went out and spoke to them tell them of thi adventur and galazi
the wolf wa with him thei listen silent and it wa plain to see
that as in the case of the headmen some of them thought on thing and
some anoth then galazi spoke to them briefli tell them that he
knew the road and the cave and the number of the halakazi cattl but
still thei doubt thereon umslopogaa ad these word
tomorrow at the dawn i bulalio holder of the ax chief of the
peopl of the ax go up against the halakazi with galazi the wolf
my brother if but ten men follow us yet we will go now choos you
soldier let those come who will and let those who will stop at home
with the women and the littl children
now a great shout rose from everi throat
we will go with you bulalio to victori or death
so on the morrow thei march and there wa wail among the women of
the peopl of the ax onli zinita did not wail but stood by in wrath
forebod evil nor would she bid her lord farewel yet when he wa
gone she wept also
now umslopogaa and hi impi travel fast and far hunger and
thirst till at length thei came to the land of the umswazi and
after a while enter the territori of the halakazi by a high and narrow
pass the fear of galazi the wolf wa that thei should find thi pass
held for though thei had harm none in the kraal as thei went and
taken onli enough cattl to feed themselv yet he knew well that
messeng had sped by dai and night to warn the peopl of the halakazi
but thei found no man in the pass and on the other side of it thei
rest for the night wa far spent at dawn umslopogaa look out
over the wide plain beyond and galazi show him a long low hill two
hour march awai
there my brother he said li the head kraal of the halakazi
where i wa born and in that hill is the great cave
then thei went on and befor the sun wa high thei came to the crest
of a rise and heard the sound of horn on it farther side thei stood
upon the rise and look and lo yet far off but run toward
them wa the whole impi of the halakazi and it wa a great impi
thei have gather their strength inde said galazi for everi man
of our there ar three of these swazi
the soldier saw also and the courag of some of them sank low then
umslopogaa spoke to them
yonder ar the swazi dog my children thei ar mani and we ar few
yet shall it be told at home that we men of the zulu blood were
hunt by a pack of swazi dog shall our women and children sing that
song in our ear o soldier of the ax
now some cri never but some were silent so umslopogaa spoke
again
turn back all who will there is yet time turn back all who will but
ye who ar men come forward with me or if ye will go back all of
you and leav ax groanmak and club watcher to see thi matter out
alon
now there aros a mighti shout of we will die togeth who have live
togeth
do you swear it cri umslopogaa hold groanmak on high
we swear it by the ax thei answer
then umslopogaa and galazi made readi for the battl thei post all
the young men in the broken ground abov the bottom of the slope
for these could best be spare to the spear and galazi the wolf took
command of them but the veteran stai upon the hillsid and with
them umslopogaa
now the halakazi came on and there were four full regiment of them
the plain wa black with them the air wa rent with their shout
and their spear flash like lightn on the farther side of the
slope thei halt and sent a herald forward to demand what the peopl of
the ax would have from them the slaughter answer that thei would
have three thing first the head of their chief whose place galazi
should fill henceforth secondli that fair maid whom men name the
lili thirdli a thousand head of cattl if these demand were grant
then he would spare them the halakazi if not he would stamp them out
and take all
so the herald return and when he reach the rank of the halakazi he
call aloud hi answer then a great roar of laughter went up from the
halakazi regiment a roar that shook the earth the brow of umslopogaa
the slaughter burn red beneath the black when he heard it and he
shook groanmak toward their host
ye shall sing anoth song befor thi sun is set he cri and
strode along the rank speak to thi man and that by name and
lift up their heart with great word
now the halakazi rais a shout and charg to come at the young men
led by galazi the wolf but beyond the foot of the slope wa peati
ground and thei came through it heavili and as thei came galazi and
the young men fell upon them and slew them still thei could not hold
them back for long becaus of their great number and present the
battl rang all along the slope but so well did galazi handl the
young men and so fierc did thei fight beneath hi ey that befor
thei could be kill or driven back all the forc of the halakazi wa
do battl with them ay and twice galazi charg with such as he
could gather and twice he check the halakazi rush throw them into
confus till at length compani wa mix with compani and regiment
with regiment but it might not endur for now more than half the young
men were down and the rest were be push back up the hill fight
madli
but all thi while umslopogaa and the veteran sat in their rank upon
the brow of the slope and watch those swazi dog have a fool for
their gener quoth umslopogaa he ha no men left to fall back
on and galazi ha broken hi arrai and mix hi regiment as milk and
cream ar mix in a bowl thei ar no longer an impi thei ar a mob
now the veteran move restlessli on their haunch push their leg
out and draw them in again thei glanc at the frai thei look
into each other ey and spoke a word here a word there well
smitten galazi wow that on is down a brave lad ho a good club is
the watcher the fight draw near my brother and ever as thei spoke
their face grew fiercer and their finger plai with their spear
at length a captain call aloud to umslopogaa

as he spoke the halakazi huddl themselv togeth and with a rush
drove back galazi and those who were left of the young men ye at last
thei were forc to flee and after them came the swazi and in the
forefront of the pursuit wa their chief ring round with a circl of
hi bravest
umslopogaa saw it and bound to hi feet roar like a bull at
them now wolv he shout
then the line of warrior sprang up as a wave spring and their crest
were like foam upon the wave as a wave that swell to break thei rose
suddenli like a break wave thei pour down the slope in front of
them wa the slaughter hold groanmak aloft and oh hi feet
were swift so swift were hi feet that strive as thei would he outran
them by the quarter of a spear throw galazi heard the thunder of
their rush he look round and as he look lo the slaughter swept
past him run like a buck then galazi too bound forward and
the wolfbrethren sped down the hill the length of four spear between
them
the halakazi also saw and heard and strove to gather themselv
togeth to meet the rush in front of umslopogaa wa their chief a
tall man hedg about with assegai straight at the shieldhedg drove

sandsnow the foe is swept like float weed and from all the line
there come a hiss like the hiss of thin water sgee sai the
hiss sgee sgee
there my father i am old what have i do with the battl ani more
with the battl and it joi yet it is better to die in such a fight
as that than to live ani other wai i have seen suchi have seen mani
such oh we could fight when i wa a man my father but none that i
knew could ever fight like umslopogaa the slaughter son of chaka
and hi bloodbroth galazi the wolf so so thei swept them awai
those halakazi thei swept them as a maid sweep the dust of a hut as
the wind sweep the wither leav it wa soon done when onc it wa
begun some were fled and some were dead and thi wa the end of that
fight no no not of all the war the halakazi were worst in the
field but mani live to win the great cave and there the work must be
finish thither then went the slaughter present with such of
hi impi as wa left to him ala mani were kill but how could thei
have di better than in that fight also those who were left were as
good as all for now thei knew that thei should not be overcom easili
while ax and club still led the wai
now thei stood befor a hill measur perhap three thousand pace
round it base it wa of no great height and yet unclimb for
after a man had gone up a littl wai the side of it were sheer
offer no foothold except to the rockrabbit and the lizard no on
wa to be seen without thi hill nor in the great kraal of the halakazi
that lai to the east of it and yet the ground about wa trampl with
the hoof of oxen and the feet of men and from within the mountain came
a sound of low cattl
here is the nest of halakazi quoth galazi the wolf
here is the nest inde said umslopogaa but how shall we come at
the egg to suck them there ar no branch on thi tree
but there is a hole in the trunk answer the wolf
now he led them a littl wai till thei came to a place where the soil
wa trampl as it is at the entranc to a cattl kraal and thei saw
that there wa a low cave which led into the cliff like an archwai such
as you white men build but thi archwai wa fill up with great block
of stone place upon each other in such a fashion that it could not be
forc from without after the cattl were driven in it had been fill
up
we cannot enter here said galazi follow me
so thei follow him and came to the north side of the mountain and
there two spearcast awai a soldier wa stand but when he saw
them he vanish suddenli
there is the place said galazi and the fox ha gone to earth in
it
now thei ran to the spot and saw a littl hole in the rock scarc
bigger than an antbear burrow and through the hole came sound and
some light
now where is the hyena who will try a new burrow cri umslopogaa
a hundr head of cattl to the man who win through and clear the
wai
then two young men sprang forward who were flush with victori and
desir noth more than to make a great name and win cattl cry
here ar hyena bulalio
to earth then said umslopogaa and let him who win through hold
the path awhil till other follow
the two young men sprang at the hole and he who reach it first went
down upon hi hand and knee and crawl in ly on hi shield and
hold hi spear befor him for a littl while the light in the burrow
vanish and thei heard the sound of hi crawl then came the nois
of blow and onc more light crept through the hole the man wa dead
thi on had a bad snake said the second soldier hi snake desert
him let me see if mine is better
so down he went on hi hand and knee and crawl as the first had
done onli he put hi shield over hi head for awhil thei heard him
crawl then onc more came the sound of blow echo on the oxhid
shield and after the blow groan he wa dead also yet it seem that
thei had left hi bodi in the hole for now no light came through thi
wa the caus my father when thei struck the man he had wriggl back
a littl wai and di there and none had enter from the farther side
to drag him out
now the soldier stare at the mouth of the passag and none seem to
love the look of it for thi wa but a poor wai to die umslopogaa and
galazi also look at it think
now i am name wolf said galazi and a wolf should not fear the
dark also these ar my peopl and i must be the first to visit
them and he went down on hi hand and knee without more ado but
umslopogaa have peer onc more down the burrow said hold
galazi i will go first i have a plan do you follow me and you my
children shout loudli so that none mai hear us move and if we win
through follow swiftli for we cannot hold the mouth of that place for
long hearken also thi is my counsel to you if i fall choos anoth
chiefgalazi the wolf if he is still live
nai slaughter do not name me said the wolf for togeth we live
or die
so let it be galazi then choos you some other man and try thi road
no more for if we cannot pass it none can but seek food and sit down
here till those jackal bolt then be readi farewel my children
farewel father thei answer go warili lest we be left like
cattl without a herdsman wander and desol
then umslopogaa crept into the hole take no shield but hold
groanmak befor him and at hi heel crept galazi when he had
cover the length of six spear he stretch out hi hand and as he
trust to do he found the feet of that man who had gone befor and
di in the place then umslopogaa the wai did thi he put hi head
beneath the dead man leg and thrust himself onward till all the bodi
wa on hi back and there he held it with on hand grip it two
wrist in hi hand then he crawl forward a littl space and saw that
he wa come to the inner mouth of the burrow but that the shadow wa
deep there becaus of a great mass of rock which lai befor the burrow
shut out the light thi is well for me thought umslopogaa for
now thei will not know the dead from the live i mai yet look upon the
sun again now he heard the halakazi soldier talk without
the zulu rat do not love thi run said on thei fear the
ratcatch stick thi is good sport and a man laugh
then umslopogaa push himself forward as swiftli as he could hold
the dead man on hi back and suddenli came out of the hole into the
open place in the dark shadow of the great rock
by the lili cri a soldier here a third take thi zulu rat
and he struck the dead man heavili with a kerri and that cri
anoth drive hi spear through him so that it prick umslopogaa
beneath and that and thi and that said other as thei smote and
stab
now umslopogaa groan heavili in the deep shadow and lai still no
need to wast more blow said the man who had struck first thi on
will never go back to zululand and i think that few will care to follow
him let us make an end run some of you and find stone to stop the
burrow for now the sport is done
he turn as he spoke and so did the other and thi wa what the
slaughter sought with a swift movement he freed himself from the dead
man and sprang to hi feet thei heard the sound and turn again but
as thei turn groanmak peck softli and that man who had sworn
by the lili wa no more a man then umslopogaa leap forward and
bound on to the great rock stood there like a buck against the sky
a zulu rat is not so easili slain o ye weasel he cri as thei
came at him from all side at onc with a roar he smote to the right
and the left and so swiftli that men could scarc see the blow fall
for he struck with groanmak beak but though men scarc saw the
blow yet my father men fell beneath them now foe were all
around leap up at the slaughter as rush water leap to hide a
rockeverywher shone spear thrust at him from thi side and from
that those in front and to the side groanmak serv to stai but on
wound umslopogaa in the neck and anoth wa lift to pierc hi
back when the strength of it holder wa bow to the dustto the dust
to becom of the dust
for now the wolf wa through the hole also and the watcher grew veri
busi he wa so busi that soon the back of the slaughter had noth
to fearyet those had much to fear who stood behind hi back the pair
fought brave make a great slaughter and present on by on
plume head of the peopl of the ax show through the burrow and
strong arm mingl in the frai swiftli thei came leap into battl
as otter leap to the waternow there were ten of them now there were
twentyand now the halakazi broke and fled sinc thei did not bargain
for thi then the rest of the men of the ax came through in peac and
the even grew toward the dark befor all had pass the hole
chapter xxvi the find of nada
umslopogaa marshal hi compani
there is littl light left he said but it must serv us to start
these coni from their burrow come my brother galazi you know where
the coni hide take my place and lead us
so galazi led the impi turn a corner of the glen he came with them
to a larg open space that had a fountain in it midst and thi place
wa full of thousand of cattl then he turn again to the left and
brought them to the inner side of the mountain where the cliff hung
over and here wa the mouth of a great cave now the cave wa dark but
by it door wa stack a pile of resin wood to serv as torch
here is that which will give us light said galazi and on man of
everi two took a torch and lit it at a fire that burn near the mouth
of the cave then thei rush in wave the flare torch and with
assegai aloft here for the last time the halakazi stood against them
and the torch float up and down upon the wave of war but thei did
not stand for veri long for all the heart wa out of them wow ye
mani were killedi do not know how mani i know thi onli that the
halakazi ar no more a tribe sinc umslopogaa who is name bulalio
stamp them with hi feetthei ar noth but a name now the peopl
of the ax drove them out into the open and finish the fight by
starlight among the cattl
in on corner of the cave umslopogaa saw a knot of men cluster round
someth as though to guard it he rush at the men and with him went
galazi and other but when umslopogaa wa through by the light of hi
torch he perceiv a tall and slender man who lean against the wall
of the cave and held a shield befor hi face
you ar a coward he cri and smote with groanmak the great ax
pierc the hide but miss the head behind rang loudli against the
rock and as it struck a sweet voic said
ah soldier do not kill me why ar you angri with me
now the shield had come awai from it holder hand upon the blade of
the ax and there wa someth in the note of the voic that caus
umslopogaa to smite no more it wa as though a memori of childhood
had come to him in a dream hi torch wa burn low but he thrust it
forward to look at him who crouch against the rock the dress wa the
dress of a man but thi wa no man formnai rather that of a love
woman wellnigh white in colour she drop her hand from befor her
face and now he could see her well he saw ey that shone like star
hair that curl and fell upon the shoulder and such beauti as wa not
known among our peopl and as the voic had spoken to him of someth
that wa lost so did the ey seem to shine across the black of
mani year and the beauti to bring back he knew not what
he look at the girl in all her loveli and she look at him in
hi fierc and hi might red with war and wound thei both look
long while the torchlight flare on them on the wall of the cave and
the broad blade of groanmak and from around rose the sound of the
frai
how ar you name who ar so fair to see he ask at length
i am name the lili now onc i had anoth name nada daughter of
mopo i wa onc but name and all els ar dead and i go to join them
kill me and make an end i will shut my ey that i mai not see the
great ax flash
now umslopogaa gaze upon her again and groanmak fell from hi
hand
look on me nada daughter of mopo he said in a low voic look at
me and sai who am i
she look onc more and yet again now her face wa thrust forward as
on who gaze over the edg of the world it grew fix and strang by
my heart she said by my heart you ar umslopogaa my brother who
is dead and whom dead as live i have love ever and alon
then the torch flare out but umslopogaa took hold of her in the
dark and press her to him and kiss her the sister whom he found
after mani year and she kiss him
you kiss me now she said yet not long ago that great ax shore
my lock miss me but by a fingersbreadthand still the sound of
fight ring in my ear ah a boon of you my brothera boon let
there be no more death sinc we ar met onc more the peopl of the
halakazi ar conquer and it is their just doom for thu in thi
same wai thei kill those with whom i live befor yet thei have
treat me well not forc me into wedlock and protect me from
dingaan so spare them my brother if you mai
then umslopogaa lift up hi voic command that the kill should
ceas and sent messeng run swiftli with these word thi is
the command of bulalio that he should lift hand against on more of
the peopl of the halakazi shall be kill himself and the soldier
obei him though the order came somewhat late and no more of the
halakazi were brought to doom thei were suffer to escap except
those of the women and children who were kept to be led awai as
captiv and thei ran far that night nor did thei come togeth again
to be a peopl for thei fear galazi the wolf who would be chief
over them but thei were scatter wide in the world to sojourn among
stranger
now when the soldier had eaten abundantli of the store of the halakazi
and guard had been sent to ward the cattl and watch against surpris
umslopogaa spoke long with nada the lili take her apart and he told
her all hi stori she told him also the tale which you know my father
of how she had live with the littl peopl that were subject to the
halakazi she and her mother macropha and how the fame of her beauti
had spread about the land then she told him how the halakazi had
claim her and of how in the end thei had taken her by forc of
arm kill the peopl of that kraal and among them her own mother
thereaft she had dwelt among the halakazi who name her anew
call her the lili and thei had treat her kindli give her
rever becaus of her sweet and beauti and not forc her into
marriag
and why would you not wed nada my sister ask umslopogaa you
who ar far past the ag of marriag
i cannot tell you she answer hang her head but i have no
heart that wai i onli seek to be left alon
now umslopogaa thought awhil and spoke do you not know then nada
why it is that i have made thi war and why the peopl of the halakazi
ar dead and scatter and their cattl the prize of my arm i will tell
you i am come here to win you whom i knew onli by report as the lili
maid the fairest of women to be a wife to dingaan the reason that i
began thi war wa to win you and make my peac with dingaan and now i
have carri it through to the end
now when she heard these word nada the lili trembl and wept
and sink to the earth she clasp the knee of umslopogaa in
supplic oh do not thi cruel thing by me your sister she
prai take rather that great ax and make an end of me and of the
beauti which ha wrought so much woe and most of all to me who wear it
would that i had not move my head behind the shield but had suffer
the ax to fall upon it to thi end i wa dress as a man that i
might meet the fate of a man ah a curs be on my woman weak that
snatch me from death to give me up to shame
thu she prai to umslopogaa in her low sweet voic and hi heart wa
shaken in him though inde he did not now purpos to give nada to
dingaan as baleka wa given to chaka perhap in the end to meet the
fate of baleka
there ar mani nada he said who would think it no misfortun that
thei should be given as a wife to the first of chief
then i am not of their number she answer nai i will die first
by my own hand if need be
now umslopogaa wonder how it came about that nada look upon
marriag thu but he did not speak of the matter he said onli tell
me then nada how i can deliv myself of thi charg i must go to
dingaan as i promis our father mopo and what shall i sai to dingaan
when he ask for the lili whom i went out to pluck and whom hi heart
desir what shall i sai to save myself aliv from the wrath of
dingaan
then nada thought and answer you shall sai thi my brother you
shall tell him that the lili be cloth in the wardress of a
warrior fell by chanc in the frai see now none of your peopl know
that you have found me thei ar think of other thing than maid in
the hour of their victori thi then is my plan we will search now by
the starlight till we find the bodi of a fair maid for doubtless some
were kill by hazard in the fight and on her we will set a warrior
dress and lai by her the corps of on of your own men tomorrow at
the light you shall take the captain of your soldier and have laid
the bodi of the girl in the dark of the cave you shall show it to them
hurriedli and tell them that thi wa the lili slain by on of your
own peopl whom in your wrath you slew also thei will not look long on
so common a sight and if by hazard thei see the maid and think her not
so veri fair thei will deem that it is death which ha rob her of
her comeli so the tale which you must tell to dingaan shall be
built up firmli and dingaan shall believ it to be true
and how shall thi be nada ask umslopogaa how shall thi be
when men see you among the captiv and know you by your beauti ar
there then two such lili in the land
i shall not be known for i shall not be seen umslopogaa you must
set me free tonight i will wander henc disguis as a youth and
cover with a blanket and if ani meet me who shall sai that i am the
lili
and where will you wander nada to your death must we then meet
after so mani year to part again for ever
where wa it that you said you live my brother beneath the shade
of a ghost mountain that men mai know by a shape of stone which is
fashion like an old woman frozen into stone wa it not tell me of
the road thither
so umslopogaa told her the road and she listen silent
good she said i am strong and my feet ar swift perhap thei
mai serv to bring me so far and perhap if i win the shadow of that
mountain you will find me a hut to hide in umslopogaa my brother
sure it shall be so my sister answer umslopogaa and yet the
wai is long and mani danger lie in the path of a maid journei alon
without food or shelter and as he spoke umslopogaa thought of zinita
hi wife for he guess that she would not love nada although she wa
onli hi sister
still it must be travel and the danger must be brave she
answer smile ala there is no other wai
then umslopogaa summon galazi the wolf and told him all thi stori
for galazi wa the onli man whom he could trust the wolf listen in
silenc marvel the while at the beauti of nada as the starlight
show it when everyth wa told he said onli that he no longer
wonder that the peopl of the halakazi had defi dingaan and brought
death upon themselv for the sake of thi maid still to be plain hi
heart thought ill of the matter for death wa not done with yet there
befor them shone the star of death and he point to the lili
now nada trembl at hi word of evil omen and the slaughter grew
angri but galazi would neither add to them nor take awai from them i
have spoken that which my heart hear he answer
then thei rose and went to search among the dead for a girl who would
suit their purpos soon thei found on a tall and fair maiden and
galazi bore her in hi arm to the great cave here in the cave were
none but the dead and toss hither and thither in their last sleep
thei look aw in the glare of the torch
thei sleep sound said the lili gaze on them rest is sweet
we shall soon win it maiden answer galazi and again nada
trembl
then have arrai her in the dress of a warrior and put a shield and
spear by her thei laid down the bodi of the girl in a dark place in the
cave and find a dead warrior of the peopl of the ax place him
besid her now thei left the cave and pretend that thei visit
the sentri umslopogaa and galazi pass from spot to spot while
the lili walk after them like a guard hide her face with a shield
hold a spear in her hand and have with her a bag of corn and dri
flesh
so thei pass on till at length thei came to the entranc in the
mountain side the stone that had block it were pull down so as to
allow those of the halakazi to fly who had been spare at the entreati
of nada but there were guard by the entranc to watch that none came
back umslopogaa challeng them and thei salut him but he saw that
thei were worn out with battl and journei and knew littl of what
thei saw or said then he galazi and nada and pass through the
open on to the plain beyond
here the slaughter and the lili bade each other farewel while galazi
watch and present the wolf saw umslopogaa return as on who is
heavi at heart and caught sight of the lili skim across the plain
lightli like a swallow
i do not know when we two shall meet again said umslopogaa so soon
as she had melt into the shadow of the night
mai you never meet answer galazi for i am sure that if you meet
that sister of your will bring death on mani more than those who now
lie low becaus of her loveli she is a star of death and when she
set the sky shall be blood red
umslopogaa did not answer but walk slowli through the archwai in the
mountain side
how is thi chief said he who wa captain of the guard three went
out but onli two return
fool answer umslopogaa ar you drunk with halakazi beer or
blind with sleep two went out and two return i sent him who wa with
us back to the camp
so be it father said the captain two went out and two return all
is well
chapter xxvii the stamp of the fire
on the morrow the impi awok refresh with sleep and after thei had
eaten umslopogaa muster them ala nearli half of those who had
seen the sun of yesterdai would wake no more forev the slaughter
muster them and thank them for that which thei had done win
fame and cattl thei were merri reck littl of those who were dead
and sang hi prais and the prais of galazi in a loud song when the
song wa end umslopogaa spoke to them again sai that the victori
wa great and the cattl thei had won were countless yet someth wa
lackingsh wa lack whom he came to seek to be a gift to dingaan
the king and for whose sake thi war wa made where now wa the lili
yesterdai she had been here clad in a moocha like a man and bear a
shield thi he knew from the captiv where then wa she now
then all the soldier said that thei had seen noth of her when
thei had done galazi spoke a word as wa agre between him and
umslopogaa he said that when thei storm the cave he had seen a man
run at a warrior in the cave to kill him then as he came he who wa
about to be slain threw down the shield and cri for merci and galazi
knew that thi wa no warrior of the halakazi but a veri beauti
girl so he call to the man to let her alon and not to touch her
for the order wa that no women should be kill but the soldier be
made with the lust of fight shout that maid or man she should die
and slew her thereon hegalaziin hi wrath ran up and smote the man
with the watcher and kill him also and he prai that he had done no
wrong
you have done well my brother said umslopogaa come now some of
you and let us look at thi dead girl perhap it is the lili and if
so that is unlucki for us for i do not know what tale we shall tell to
dingaan of the matter
so the captain went with umslopogaa and galazi and came to the spot
where the girl had been laid and by her the man of the peopl of the
ax
all is as the wolf my brother ha told said umslopogaa wave
the torch in hi hand over the two who lai dead here without a doubt
li she who wa name the lili whom we came to win and by her that
fool who slew her slain himself by the blow of the watcher an ill
sight to see and an ill tale for me to tell at the kraal of dingaan
still what is is and cannot be alter and thi maid who wa the
fairest of the fair is now none to love to look on let us awai and
he turn swiftli then spoke again sai
bind up thi dead girl in ox hide cover her with salt and let her be
brought with us and thei did so
then the captain said sure it is so my father now it cannot be
alter and dingaan must miss hi bride so said thei all except that
man who had been captain of the guard when umslopogaa and galazi and
anoth pass through the archwai thi man inde said noth yet
he wa not without hi thought for it seem to him that he had seen
three pass through the archwai and not two it seem to him moreov
that the kaross which the third wore had slip asid as she press
past him and that beneath it he had seen the shape of a beauti
woman and abov it had caught the glint of a woman eyean ey full
and dark like a buck
also thi captain note that bulalio call none of the captiv to
swear to the bodi of the lili maid and that he shook the torch to and
fro as he held it over herh whose hand wa of the steadiest all of
thi he kept in hi mind forget noth
now it chanc afterward on the homeward march my father that
umslopogaa had caus to speak angrili to thi man becaus he tri to
rob anoth of hi share of the spoil of the halakazi he spoke sharpli
to him degrad him from hi rank and set anoth over him also
he took cattl from the man and gave them to him whom he would have
rob
and thereaft though he wa justli serv thi man thought more and
more of the third who had pass through the arch of the cave and had
not return and who seem to him to have a fair woman shape and
ey which gleam like those of a woman
on that dai then umslopogaa began hi march to the kraal
umgugundhlovu where dingaan sat but befor he set hi face homeward
in the presenc of the soldier he ask galazi the wolf if he
would come back with him or if he desir to stai to be chief of the
halakazi as he wa by right of birth and war then the wolf laugh
and answer that he had come out to seek for vengeanc and not for the
place of a chief also that there were few of the halakazi peopl left
over whom he might rule if he wish moreov he ad thi that
like twin tree thei two bloodbrethren had grown up side by side till
their root were mat togeth and that were on of them dug up and
plant in swazi soil he fear lest both should wither or at the
last that he galazi would wither who love but on man and certain
wolv
so umslopogaa said no more of the chieftainship but began hi journei
with him he brought a great number of cattl to be a gift for dingaan
and a multitud of captiv young women and children for he would
appeas the heart of dingaan becaus he did not bring her whom he
soughtth lili flower of flower yet becaus he wa cautiou and
put littl faith in the kind of king umslopogaa so soon as he
reach the border of zululand sent the best of the cattl and the
fairest of the maid and children on to the kraal of the peopl of the
ax by the ghost mountain and he who had been captain of the guard but
now wa a common soldier notic thi also
now it chanc that on a certain morn i mopo sat in the kraal
umgugundhlovu in attend on dingaan for still i wait on the king
though he had spoken no word to me good or bad sinc the yesterdai
when i foretold to him that in the blood of the white men whom he had
betrai grew the flower of hi own death for my father it wa on the
morrow of the slai of the amaboona that umslopogaa came to the kraal
umgugundhlovu
now the mind of dingaan wa heavi and he sought someth to lighten
it present he bethought himself of the white prai man who had
come to the kraal seek to teach us peopl of the zulu to worship
other god than the assegai and the king now thi wa a good man
but no luck went with hi teach which wa hard to understand and
moreov the induna did not like it becaus it seem to set a master
over the master and a king over the king and to preach of peac to
those whose trade wa war still dingaan sent for the white man that
he might disput with him for dingaan thought that he himself wa the
cleverest of all men
now the white man came but hi face wa pale becaus of that which he
had seen befal the boer for he wa gentl and hate such sight the
king bade him be seat and spoke to him sai
the other dai o white man thou toldest me of a place of fire whither
those go after death who have done wickedli in life tell me now of thy
wisdom do my father lie in that place
how can i know king answer the prayerdoctor who mai not judg
of the deed of men thi i sai onli that those who murder and rob and
oppress the innoc and bear fals wit shall lie in that place of
fire
it seem that my father have done all these thing and if thei ar in
thi place i would go there also for i am mind to be with my father
at the last yet i think that i should find a wai to escap if ever i
came there
how king
now dingaan had set thi trap for the prayerdoctor in the centr of
that open space where he had caus the boer to be fallen upon he had
built up a great pyre of woodbrushwood beneath and on top of the
brushwood log and even whole tree perhap my father there were
sixti full wagonload of dry wood pile togeth there in the centr of
the place
thou shalt see with thine ey white man he answer and bid
attend set fire to the pile all round he summon that regiment of
young men which wa left in the kraal mayb there were a thousand and
half a thousand of themnot moreth same that had slain the boer
now the fire began to burn fierc and the regiment file in and
took it place in rank by the time that all had come the pyre wa
everywher a sheet of rage flame and though we sat a hundr pace
from it it heat wa great when the wind turn our wai
now doctor of prayer is thy hot place hotter than yonder fire said
the king
he answer that he did not know but the fire wa certainli hot
then i will show thee how i will come out of it if ever i go to lie
in such a fireai though it be ten time as big and fierc ho my
children he cri to the soldier and spring up you see yonder
fire run swiftli and stamp it flat with your feet where there wa fire
let there be black and ash
now the white man lift hi hand and prai dingaan not to do thi
thing that should be the death of mani but the king bade him be silent
then he turn hi ey upward and prai to hi god for a moment
also the soldier look on each other in doubt for the fire rage
furious and spout of flame shot high toward the heaven and abov
it and about it the hot air danc but their captain call to them
loudli great is the king hear the word of the king who honour you
yesterdai we at up the amaboonait wa noth thei were unarm
there is a foe more worthi of our valour come my children let us wash
in the firew who ar fiercer than the fire great is the king who
honour us
thu he spoke and ran forward and with a roar after him sprang the
soldier rank by rank thei were brave men inde moreov thei knew
that if death lai befor them death also await him who lag behind
and it is far better to die with honour than asham on thei went as
to the joi of battl their captain lead them and as thei went thei
sang the ingomo the warchant of the zulu now the captain near the
rage fire we saw him lift hi shield to keep off it heat then he
wa goneh had sprung into the heart of the furnac and but littl
of him wa ever found again after him went the first compani in thei
went beat at the flame with their oxhid shield stamp them
out with their nake feet tear down the burn log and cast
them asid not on man of that compani live my father thei fell
down like moth which flutter through a candl and where thei fell thei
perish but after them came other compani and it wa well for those
in thi fight who were last to grappl with the foe now a great smoke
wa mix with the flame now the flame grew less and less and the
smoke more and more and now blacken men hairless nake and
blister white with the scorch of the fire stagger out on the
farther side of the flame fall to earth here and there after them
came other now there wa no flame onli a great smoke in which men
move dimli and present my father it wa done thei had conquer
the fire and that with but veri littl hurt to the last seven
compani though everi man had trodden it how mani perishednai
i know not thei were never count but what between the dead and the
injur that regiment wa at half strength till the king draft more
men into it
see doctor of prayer said dingaan with a laugh thu shall i
escap the fire of that land of which thou tellest if such there be
inde i will bid my impi stamp them out
then the prai man went from the kraal sai that he would teach no
more among the zulu and afterward he left the land when he had gone
the burnt wood and the dead were clear awai the injur were doctor
or kill accord to their hurt and those who had littl harm came
befor the king and prais him
new shield and headress must be found for you my children said
dingaan for the shield were black and shrivel and of head of hair
and plume there were but few left among that regiment
wow said dingaan again look at the soldier who still live
shave will be easi and cheap in that place of fire of which the white
man speak
then he order beer to be brought to the men for the heat had made
them thirsti
now though you mai not guess it my father i have told you thi tale
becaus it ha someth to do with my stori for scarc had the
matter been end when messeng came sai that bulalio chief of
the peopl of the ax and hi impi were without have return with
much spoil from the slai of the halakazi in swaziland now when i
heard thi my heart leapt for joi see that i had fear greatli for
the fate of umslopogaa my fosterl dingaan also wa veri glad and
spring up danc to and fro like a child
now at last we have good tide he said at onc forget the
stamp of the fire and now shall my ey behold that lili whom my
hand ha long to pluck let bulalio and hi peopl enter swiftli
for awhil there wa silenc then from far awai without the high fenc
of the great place there came a sound of sing and through the
gate of the kraal rush two great men wear black plume upon their
head have black shield in their left hand and in their right
on an ax and on a club while about their shoulder were bound
wolfskin thei ran low neck and neck with outstretch shield and
head held forward as a buck run when he is hard press by dog and
no such run had been seen in the kraal umgugundhlovu as the run
of the wolfbrethren half across the space thei ran and halt
suddenli and as thei halt the dead ash of the fire flew up befor
their feet in a littl cloud
by my head look these come arm befor me said dingaan frown
and to do thi is death now sai who is that man great and fierc
who bear an ax aloft did i not know him dead i should sai it wa the
black on my brother as he wa in the dai of the smite of zwide so
wa hi head set on hi shoulder and so he wa wont to look round like
a lion
i think that is bulalio the slaughter chief of the peopl of the
ax o king i answer
and who is the other with him he is a great man also never have i
seen such a pair
i think that is galazi the wolf he who is bloodbroth to the
slaughter and hi gener i said again
now after these two came the soldier of the peopl of the ax arm
with short stick alon four by four thei came all hold their head
low and with black shield outstretch and form themselv into
compani behind the wolfbrethren till all were there then after
them the crowd of the halakazi slave were driven inwomen boi and
maid a great numberand thei stood behind the rank huddl togeth
like frighten calv
a gallant sight truli said dingaan as he look upon the compani
of blackplum and shield warrior i have no better soldier in my
impi and yet my ey behold these for the first time and again he
frown
now suddenli umslopogaa lift hi ax and start forward at full
speed and after him thunder the compani on thei rush and their
plume lai back upon the wind till it seem as though thei must stamp
us flat but when he wa within ten pace of the king umslopogaa lift
groanmak again and galazi held the watcher on high and everi man
halt where he wa while onc more the dust flew up in cloud thei
halt in long unbroken line with outstretch shield and head held
low no man head rose more than the length of a danc kerri from the
earth so thei stood on minut then for the third time umslopogaa
lift groanmak and in an instant everi man straighten himself
each shield wa toss on high and from everi throat wa roar the
royal salut bayet
a pretti sight forsooth quoth dingaan but these soldier ar too
well drill who have never done me servic nor the black on who wa
befor me and thi slaughter is too good a captain i sai come
hither ye twain he cri aloud
then the wolfbrethren strode forward and stood befor the king and for
awhil thei look upon each other
chapter xxviii the lili is brought to dingaan
how ar you name said dingaan
we ar name bulalio the slaughter and galazi the wolf o king
answer umslopogaa
wa it thou who didst send a certain messag to the black on who is
dead bulalio
yea o king i sent a messag but from all i have heard masilo my
messeng gave more than the messag for he stab the black on
masilo had an evil heart
now dingaan winc for he knew well that he himself and on mopo had
stab the black on but he thought that thi outland chief had not
heard the tale so he said no more of the messag
how is it that ye dare to come befor me arm know ye not the rule
that he who appear arm befor the king di
we have not heard that law o king said umslopogaa moreov there
is thi to be told my virtu of the ax i bear i rule alon if i am
seen without the ax then ani man mai take my place who can for the
ax is chieftai of the peopl of the ax and he who hold it is it
servant
a strang custom said dingaan but let it pass and thou wolf what
hast thou to sai of that great club of thine
there is thi to be told of the club o king answer galazi by
virtu of the club i guard my life if i am seen without the club then
mai ani man take my life who can for the club is my watcher not i
watcher of the club
never wast thou nearer to the lose of both club and life said
dingaan angrili
it mai be so o king answer the wolf when the hour is then
without a doubt the watcher shall ceas from hi watch
ye ar a strang pair quoth dingaan where have you been now and
what is your busi at the place of the eleph
we have been in a far countri o king answer umslopogaa we have
wander in a distant land to search for a flower to be a gift to a
king and in our search we have trampl down a swazi garden
and yonder ar some of those who tend itand he point to the
captivesand without ar the cattl that plough it
good slaughter i see the garden and i hear the low of the
cattl but what of the flower where is thi flower ye went so far to
dig in swazi soil wa it a lilybloom perchanc
it wa a lilybloom o king and yet ala the lili ha wither
noth is left but the stalk white and wither as ar the bone of
men
what meanest thou said dingaan start to hi feet
that the king shall learn answer umslopogaa and turn he
spoke a word to the captain who were behind him present the rank
open up and four men ran forward from the rear of the compani
on their shoulder thei bore a stretcher and upon the stretcher lai
someth wrap about with raw oxhid and bound round with rimpi
the men salut and laid their burden down befor the king
open said the slaughter and thei open and there within the
hide pack in salt lai the bodi of a girl who onc wa tall and
fair
here li the lili stalk o king said umslopogaa point with
the ax but if her flower bloom on ani air it is not here
now dingaan stare at the sight of death and bitter of heart took
hold of him sinc he desir abov all thing to win the beauti of the
lili for himself
bear awai thi carrion and cast it to the dog he cri for thu he
could speak of her whom he would have taken to wife when onc he deem
her dead take it awai and thou slaughter tell me how it came
about that the maid wa slain it will be well for thee if thou hast a
good answer for know thy life hang on the word
so umslopogaa told the king all that tale which had been made readi
against the wrath of dingaan and when he had finish galazi told hi
stori of how he had seen the soldier kill the maid and in hi wrath
had kill the soldier then certain of the captain who had seen the
soldier and the maid ly in on death came forward and spoke to it
now dingaan wa veri angri and yet there wa noth to be done the
lili wa dead and by no fault of ani except of on who wa also dead
and beyond hi reach
get you henc you and your peopl he said to the wolfbrethren i
take the cattl and the captiv be thank that i do not take all
your live alsofirst becaus ye have dare to make war without my
word and secondli becaus have made war ye have so brought it
about that though ye bring me the bodi of her i sought ye do not bring
the life
now when the king spoke of take the live of all the peopl of the
ax umslopogaa smile grimli and glanc at hi compani then
salut the king he turn to go but as he turn a man sprang
forward from the rank and call to dingaan sai
is it grant that i mai speak truth befor the king and afterward
sleep in the king shadow
now thi wa that man who had been captain of the guard on the night
when three pass out through the archwai and two return that same
man whom umslopogaa had degrad from hi rank
speak on thou art safe answer dingaan
o king thy ear have been fill with li said the soldier
hearken o king i wa captain of the guard of the gate on that
night of the slai of the halakazi three came to the gate of the
mountainthei were bulalio the wolf galazi and anoth that other
wa tall and slim bear a shield highso as the third pass the
gate the kaross he wore brush against me and slip asid beneath
that kaross wa no man breast o king but the shape of a woman
almost white in colour and veri fair in draw back the kaross thi
third on move the shield behind that shield wa no man face o
king but the face of a girl loveli than the moon and have ey
brighter than the star three went out at the mountain gate o king
onli two return and peep after them it seem that i saw the
third run swiftli across the plain as a young maid run o king
thi also eleph bulalio yonder deni me when as captain of the
guard i ask for the third who had pass the gate sai that onli
two had pass further none of the captiv were call to swear
to the bodi of the maid and now it is too late and that man who lai
besid her wa not kill by galazi in the cave he wa kill outsid
the cave by a blow of a halakazi kerri i saw him fall with my own
ey and slew the man who smote him on thing more king of the world
the best of the captiv and the cattl ar not here for a gift to
theethei ar at the kraal of bulalio chief of the peopl of the ax
i have spoken o king ye becaus my heart love not li i have
spoken the truth and now do thou protect me from these wolfbrethren o
king for thei ar veri fierc
now all thi while that the traitor told hi tale umslopogaa inch by
inch wa edg near to him and yet nearer till at length he might
have touch him with an outstretch spear none note him except
i mopo alon and perhap galazi for all were watch the face of
dingaan as men watch a storm that is about to burst
fear thou not the wolfbrethren soldier gasp dingaan roll hi
red ey the paw of the lion guard thee my servant
er the word had left the king lip the slaughter leapt he leap
full on to the traitor speak never a word and oh hi ey were
aw he leap upon him he seiz him with hi hand lift no
weapon and in hi terribl might he broke him as a child break a
sticknai i know not how it wa too swift to see he broke him and
hurl him on high cast him dead at the feet of dingaan cry in a
great voic
take thy servant king sure he sleep in thy shadow
then there wa silenc onli through the silenc wa heard a gasp
of fear and wonder for no such deed as thi had been wrought in the
presenc of the kingno not sinc the dai of senzangacona the root
now dingaan spoke and hi voic came thick with rage and hi limb
trembl
slai him he hiss slai the dog and all those with him
now we come to a game which i can plai answer umslopogaa ho
peopl of the ax will you stand to be slaughter by these sing
rat and he point with groanmak at those warrior who had escap
without hurt in the fire but whose face the fire had scorch
then for answer a great shout went up a shout and a roar of laughter
and thi wa the shout
no slaughter not so ar we mind and right and left thei face
to meet the foe while from all along the compani came the crackl
of the shaken shield
back sprang umslopogaa to head hi men forward leap the soldier of
the king to work the king will if so thei might and galazi the wolf
also sprang forward toward dingaan and as he sprang swung up the
watcher cry in a great voic
hold
again there wa silenc for men saw that the shadow of the watcher lai
dark upon the head of dingaan
it is a piti that mani should die when on will suffic cri the
wolf again let a blow be struck and where hi shadow li there shall
the watcher be and lo the world will lack a king a word king
now dingaan look up at the great man who stood abov him and felt
the shadow of the shine club lie cold upon hi brow and again he
shookthi time it wa with fear
begon in peac he said
a good word for thee king said the wolf grin and slowli he
drew himself backward toward the compani sai prais the king
the king bid hi children go in peac
but when dingaan felt that hi brow wa no longer cold with the shadow
of death hi rage came back to him and he would have call to
the soldier to fall upon the peopl of the ax onli i stai him
sai
thy death is in it o king the slaughter will grind such men as thou
hast here beneath hi feet and then onc more shall the watcher look
upon thee
now dingaan saw that thi wa true and gave no command for he had onli
those men with him whom the fire had left all the rest were gone to
slaughter the boer in natal still he must have blood so he turn on
me
thou art a traitor mopo as i have known for long and i will serv
thee as yonder dog serv hi faithless servant and he thrust at me
with the assegai in hi hand
but i saw the stroke and spring high into the air avoid it
then i turn and fled veri swiftli and after me came certain of the
soldier the wai wa not far to the last compani of the peopl of the
ax moreov it saw me come and head by umslopogaa who walk
behind them all ran to meet me then the soldier who follow to kill
me hung back out of reach of the ax
here with the king is no place for me ani more my son i said to
umslopogaa
fear not my father i will find you a place he answer
then i call a messag to the soldier who follow me sai
tell thi to the king that he ha done ill to drive me from him for
i mopo set him on the throne and i alon can hold him there tell him
thi also that he will do yet wors to seek me where i am for that
dai when we ar onc more face to face shall be hi dai of death thu
speak mopo the inyanga mopo the doctor who never yet prophesi that
which should not be
then we march from the kraal umgugundhlovu and when next i saw that
kraal it wa to burn all of it which dingaan had left unburnt and when
next i saw dingaanah that is to be told of my father
we march from the kraal none hinder us for there were none
to hinder and after we had gone a littl wai umslopogaa halt and
said
now it is in my mind to return whenc we came and slai thi dingaan
er he slai me
yet it is well to leav a frighten lion in hi thicket my son for a
lion at bai is hard to handl doubt not that everi man young and old
in umgugundhlovu now stand arm about the gate lest such a thought
should take you my son and though just now he wa afraid yet dingaan
will strike for hi life when you might have kill you did not kill
now the hour ha gone
wise word said galazi i would that the watcher had fallen where
hi shadow fell
what is your counsel now father ask umslopogaa
thi then that you two should abid no more beneath the shadow of the
ghost mountain but should gather your peopl and your cattl and pass
to the north on the track of mosilikatz the lion who broke awai
from chaka there you mai rule apart or togeth and never dream of
dingaan
i will not do that father he answer i will dwell beneath the
shadow of the ghost mountain while i mai
and so will i said galazi or rather among it rock what shall my
wolv lack a master when thei would go ahunt shall greysnout and
blackfang blood and deathgrip and their compani black and grei howl
for me in vain
so be it children ye ar young and will not listen to the counsel of
the old let it befal as it chanc
i spoke thu for i did not know then why umslopogaa would not leav
hi kraal it wa for thi reason becaus he had bidden nada to meet
him there
afterward when he found her he would have gone but then the sky wa
clear the dangercloud had melt for awhil
oh that umslopogaa my fosterl had listen to me now he would have
reign as a king not wander an outcast in strang land i know not
where and nada should have live not di nor would the peopl of the
ax have ceas to be a peopl
thi of dingaan when he heard my messag he grew afraid onc more for
he knew me to be no liar
therefor he held hi hand for awhil send no impi to smite
umslopogaa lest it might come about that i should bring him hi death
as i had promis and befor the fear had worn awai it happen that
dingaan hand were full with the war against the amaboona becaus of
hi slaughter of the white peopl and he had no soldier to spare with
whom to wreak vengeanc on a petti chief live far awai
yet hi rage wa great becaus of what had chanc and after hi
custom he murder mani innoc peopl to satisfi it
chapter xxix mopo tell hi tale
now afterward as we went upon our road umslopogaa told me all there
wa to tell of the slai of the halakazi and of the find of nada
when i heard that nada my daughter still live i wept for joi though
like umslopogaa i wa torn by doubt and fear for it is far for an
unaid maid to travel from swaziland to the ghost mountain yet all
thi while i said noth to umslopogaa of the truth as to hi birth
becaus on the journei there were mani around us and the veri tree
have ear and the same wind to which we whisper might whisper to the
king still i knew that the hour had come now when i must speak for it
wa in my mind to bring it about that umslopogaa should be proclaim
the son of chaka and be made king of the zulu in the place of dingaan
hi uncl yet all these thing had gone cross for us becaus it wa
fate so my father had i known that umslopogaa still live when i
slew chaka then i think that i could have brought it about that he
should be king or had thing fallen out as i plan and the lili maid
been brought to dingaan and umslopogaa grew great in hi sight then
perhap i could have brought it about but all thing had gone wrong
the lili wa none other than nada and how could umslopogaa give nada
whom he thought hi sister and who wa my daughter to dingaan against
her will also becaus of nada dingaan and umslopogaa were now at
bitter enmiti and for thi same caus i wa disgrac and a fugit
and my counsel would no longer be heard in the ear of the king
so everyth must be begun afresh and as i walk with the impi
toward the ghost mountain i thought much and often of the manner in
which thi might be done but as yet i said noth
now at last we were beneath the ghost mountain and look upon the face
of the old witch who sit there aloft forev wait for the world to
die and that same night we came to the kraal of the peopl of the ax
and enter it with a great sing but galazi did not enter at that
time he wa awai to the mountain to call hi flock of wolv and as we
pass it foot we heard the welcom that the wolv howl in greet
to him
now as we drew near the kraal all the women and children came out
to meet us head by zinita the head wife of umslopogaa thei came
joyfulli but when thei found how mani were want who a moon befor
had gone thenc to fight their joi wa turn to mourn and the
voic of their weep went up to heaven
umslopogaa greet zinita kindli and yet i thought that there wa
someth lack at first she spoke to him softli but when she
learn all that had come to pass her word were not soft for she
revil me and sang a loud song at umslopogaa
see now slaughter she said see now what ha came about becaus
you listen to thi ag foolthat wa i my fatherthi fool who
call himself mouth ay a mouth he is a mouth out of which proce
folli and li what did he counsel you to doto go up against these
halakazi and win a girl for dingaan and what have you doney have
fallen upon the halakazi and doubtless have kill mani innoc peopl
with that great ax of your also you have left nearli half of the
soldier of the ax to whiten in the swazi cave and in exchang have
brought back certain cattl of a small breed and girl and children
whom we must nourish
nor doe the matter end here you went it seem to win a girl whom
dingaan desir yet when you find that girl you let her go becaus
inde you sai she wa your sister and would not wed dingaan forsooth
is not the king good enough for thi sister of your now what is the
end of the tale you try to plai trick on the king becaus of your
sister and ar found out then you kill a man befor dingaan and
escap bring thi fool of an ag mouth with you that he mai teach
you hi own folli so you have lost half of your men and you have
gain the king for a foe who shall bring about the death of all of us
and a fool for a councillor wow slaughter keep to your trade and
let other find you wit
thu she spoke without ceas and there wa some truth in her word
zinita had a bitter tongu i sat silent till she had finish and
umslopogaa also remain silent though hi anger wa great becaus
there wa no crack in her talk through which a man might thrust a word
peac woman i said at length do not speak ill of those who ar
wise and who had seen much befor you were born
speak no ill of him who is my father growl umslopogaa ay though
you do not know it thi mouth whom you revil is mopo my father
then there is a man among the peopl of the ax who ha a fool for a
father of all tide thi is the worst
there is a man among the peopl of the ax who ha a jade and a scold
for a wife said umslopogaa spring up begon zinitaand know
thi that if i hear you snarl such word of him who is my father you
shall go further than your own hut for i will put you awai and drive
you from my kraal i have suffer you too long
i go said zinita oh i am well serv i made you chief and now
you threaten to put me awai
my own hand made me chief said umslopogaa and spring up he
thrust her from the hut
it is a poor thing to be wed to such a woman my father he said
present
ye a poor thing umslopogaa yet these ar the burden that men must
bear learn wisdom from it umslopogaa and have as littl to do with
women as mai be at the least do not love them overmuch so shall
you find the more peac thu i spoke smile and would that he had
listen to my counsel for it is the love of women which ha brought
ruin on umslopogaa
all thi wa mani year ago and but late i have heard that
umslopogaa is fled into the north and becom a wander to hi death
becaus of the matter of a woman who had betrai him make it seem
that he had murder on loustra who wa hi blood brother just as
galazi had been i do not know how it came about but he who wa so
fierc and strong had that weak like hi uncl dingaan and it ha
destroi him at the last and for thi caus i shall behold him no
more
now my father for awhil we were silent and alon in the hut and as
we sat i thought i heard a rat stir in the thatch
then i spoke umslopogaa at length the hour ha come that i should
whisper someth into your ear a word which i have held secret ever
sinc you were born
speak on my father he said wonder
i crept to the door of the hut and look out the night wa dark and i
could see none about and could hear no on move yet be cautiou i
walk round the hut ah my father when you have a secret to tell
be not so easili deceiv it is not enough to look forth and to peer
round dig beneath the floor and search the roof also then have
done all thi go elsewher and tell your tale the woman wa right i
wa but a fool for all my wisdom and my white hair had i not been a
fool i would have smoke out that rat in the thatch befor ever i open
my lip for the rat wa zinita my fatherzinita who had climb
the hut and now lai there in the dark her ear upon the smokehol
listen to everi word that pass it wa a wick thing to do and
moreov the worst of omen but there is littl honour among women
when thei learn that which other wish to hide awai from them nor
inde do thei then weight omen
so have search and found noth i spoke to umslopogaa my
fosterl not know that death in a woman shape lai on the hut
abov us hearken i said you ar no son of mine umslopogaa
though you have call me father from a babe you spring from a loftier
stock slaughter
yet i wa well pleas with my father old man said umslopogaa
the breed is good enough for me sai then whose son am i
now i bent forward and whisper to him yet ala not low enough you
ar the son of the black on who is dead yea sprung from the blood of
chaka and of baleka my sister
i still have some kinship with you then mopo and that i am glad of
wow who would have guess that i wa the son of the silwana of that
hyena man perhap it is for thi reason that like galazi i love the
compani of the wolv though no love grow in my heart for my father or
ani of hi hous
you have littl caus to love him umslopogaa for he murder your
mother baleka and would have slain you also but you ar the son of
chaka and of no other man
well hi ey must be keen inde my uncl who can pick hi own
father out of a crowd and yet i onc heard thi tale befor though i
had long forgotten it
from whom did you hear it umslopogaa an hour sinc it wa known to
on alon the other ar dead who knew it now it is known to twoah
my father i did not guess of the thirdfrom whom then did you hear
it
it wa from the dead at least galazi the wolf heard it from the dead
on who sat in the cave on ghost mountain for the dead on told him
that a man would come to be hi brother who should be name umslopogaa
bulalio son of chaka and galazi repeat it to me but i had long
forgotten it
it seem that there is wisdom among the dead i answer for lo
todai you ar name umslopogaa bulalio and todai i declar you the
son of chaka but listen to my tale
then i told him all the stori from the hour of hi birth onward and
when i spoke of the word of hi mother baleka after i had told my
dream to her and of the manner of her death by the command of chaka
and of the great fashion in which she had di then i sai umslopogaa
wept who i think seldom wept befor or after but as my tale drew it
it end i saw that he listen ill as a man listen who ha a weightier
matter press on hi heart and befor it wa well done he broke in
so mopo my uncl if i am the son of chaka and baleka nada the lili
is no sister to me
nai umslopogaa she is onli your cousin
over near of blood he said yet that shall not stand between us
and hi face grew glad
i look at him in question
you grow dull my uncl thi is my mean that i will marri nada if
she still live for it come upon me now that i have never love ani
woman as i love nada the lili and while he spoke i heard the rat stir
in the thatch of the hut
wed her if you will umslopogaa i answer yet i think that on
zinita your inkosikasi will find word to sai in the matter
zinita is my head wife inde but shall she hold me back from take
other wive after the law custom of our peopl he ask angrili
and hi anger show that he fear the wrath of zinita
the custom is law and good i said but it ha bred troubl at
time zinita can have littl to sai if she continu in her place and
you still love her as of old but enough of her nada is not yet at your
gate and perhap she will never find them see umslopogaa it is my
desir that you should rule in zululand by right of blood and though
thing point otherwis yet i think a wai can be found to bring it
about
how so he ask
thu mani of the great chief who ar friend to me hate dingaan and
fear him and did thei know that a son of chaka live and that son the
slaughter he well might climb to the throne upon their shoulder
also the soldier love the name of chaka though he dealt cruelli with
them becaus at least he wa brave and gener but thei do not love
dingaan for hi burden ar the burden of chaka but hi gift ar the
gift of dingaan therefor thei would welcom chaka son if onc thei
knew him for certain but it is here that the necklet chafe for there
is but my word to prove it yet i will try
perhap it is worth try and perhap it is not my uncl answer
umslopogaa on thing i know i had rather see nada at my gate
tonight than hear all the chief in the land cry hail o king
you will live to think otherwis umslopogaa and now spi must be
set at the kraal umgugundhlovu to give us warn of the mind of the
king lest he should send an impi suddenli to eat you up perhap hi
hand mai be too full for that er long for those white amaboona will
answer hi assegai with bullet and on more word let noth be said
of thi matter of your birth least of all to zinita your wife or to
ani other woman
fear not uncl he answer i know how to be silent
now after awhil umslopogaa left me and went to the hut of zinita hi
inkosikasi where she lai wrap in her blanket and as it seem
asleep
greet my husband she said slowli like on who waken i have
dream a strang dream of you i dream that you were call a king
and that all the regiment of the zulu file past give you the royal
salut bayet
umslopogaa look at her wonder for he did not know if she had
learn someth or if thi wa an omen such dream ar danger
he said and he who dream them doe well to lock them fast till thei
be forgotten
or fulfil said zinita and again umslopogaa look at her
wonder
now after thi night i began my work for i establish spi at the
kraal of dingaan and from them i learn all that pass with the king
at first he gave order that an impi should be summon to eat up the
peopl of the ax but afterward came tide that the boer to
the number of five hundr mount men were march on the kraal
umgugundhlovu so dingaan had no impi to spare to send to the ghost
mountain and we who were beneath it shadow dwelt there in peac
thi time for boer were beaten for bogoza the spy led them into
an ambush still few were kill and thei did but draw back that thei
might jump the further and dingaan knew thi at thi time also the
english white men of natal the peopl of georg who attack dingaan
by the lower tugela were slain by our soldier and those with them
also by the help of certain witchdoctor i fill the land with
rumour propheci and dark sai and i work cunningli on the
mind of mani chief that were known to me send them messag hardli
to be understood such as should prepar their thought for the come
of on who should be declar to them thei listen but the task wa
long for the men dwelt far apart and some of them were awai with the
regiment
so the time went by till mani dai had pass sinc we reach the
ghost mountain umslopogaa had no more word with zinita but she
alwai watch him and he went heavili for he await nada and nada
did not come
but at length nada came
chapter xxx the come of nada
on nightit wa a night of full mooni sat alon with umslopogaa
in my hut and we spoke of the matter of our plot then when we had
finish that talk we spoke of nada the lili

nada she is sure dead or in bond otherwis she had been here
long ago i have sought far and wide and can hear no tide and find
noth
all that is hidden is not lost i answer yet i myself believ that
there wa an end of nada
then we were silent awhil and present in the silenc a dog bark
we rose and crept out of the hut to see what it might be that stir
for the night drew on and it wa need to be wari sinc a dog might
bark at the stir of a leaf or perhap it might be the distant
footfal of an impi that it heard
we had not far to look for stand gaze at the hut like on who is
afraid to call wa a tall slim man hold an assegai in on hand
and a littl shield in the other we could not see the face of the man
becaus the light wa behind him and a rag blanket hung about hi
shoulder also he wa footsor for he rest on on leg now we
were peer round the hut and it shadow hid us so that the man saw
noth for awhil he stood still then he spoke to himself and hi
voic wa strang soft
here ar mani hut said the voic now how mai i know which is the
hous of my brother perhap if i call i shall bring soldier to me and
be forc to plai the man befor them and i am weari of that well i
will lie here under the fenc till morn it is a softer bed than

figur sigh and turn so that the light of the moon fell full upon
it face

so mani year yet across the year i knew it at onc ye though the
bud had becom a flower i knew it the face wa weari and worn but ah
it wa beauti never befor nor sinc have i seen such beauti for
there wa thi about the loveli of my daughter the lili it seem
to flow from withiny as light will flow through the thin rind of a
gourd and in that she differ from the other women of our peopl who
when thei ar fair ar fair with the flesh alon
now my heart went out to nada as she stood in the moonlight on
forsaken not have where to lai her head nada who alon wa left
aliv of all my children i motion to umslopogaa to hide himself in
the shadow and step forward
ho i said roughli who ar you wander and what do you here

moocha is of a swazi make and here we do not love swazi
were you not old i would beat you for your insol said nada
strive to look brave and all the while search a wai to escap
also i have no stick onli a spear and that is for warrior not for
an old umfagozan like you ay my father i live to hear my daughter
name me an umfagozana low fellow
now make pretenc to be angri i leap at her with my kerri up
and forget her courag she drop her spear and utter a littl
scream but she still held the shield befor her face i seiz her
by the arm and struck a blow upon the shield with my kerrieit would
scarc have crush a fly but thi brave warrior trembl sore
where now is your valour you who name my umfagozan i said you who
cry like a maid and whose arm is soft as a maid
she made no answer but hug her tatter blanket round her and
shift my grip from her arm i seiz it and rent it show her
breast and shoulder then i let her go laugh and said
lo here is the warrior that would beat an old umfagozan for hi
insol a warrior well shape for war now my pretti maid who wander
at night in the garment of a man what tale have you to tell swift with
it lest i drag you to the chief as hi prize the old man seek a new
wife thei tell me
now when nada saw that i had discov her she threw down the shield
after the spear as a thing that wa of no more us and hung her head
sullenli but when i spoke of drag her to the chief then she flung
herself upon the ground and clasp my knee for sinc i call him
old she thought that thi chief could not be umslopogaa
oh my father said the lili oh my father have piti on me ye
ye i am a girl a maidno wifeand you who ar old you perchanc
have daughter such as i and in their name i ask for piti my father
i have journei far i have endur mani thing to find my wai to a

wrong kraal forgiv me that i spoke to you so my father it wa but a
woman feint and i wa hard press to hide my sex for my father you
know it is ill to be a lone girl among strang men
now i said noth in answer for thi reason onli that when i heard
nada call me father not know me and saw her clasp my knee and prai
to me in my daughter name i who wa childless save for her went
nigh to weep but she thought that i did not answer her becaus i wa
angri and about to drag her to thi unknown chief and implor me the
more even with tear
my father she said do not thi wick thing by me let me go and
show me the path that i shall ask you who ar old you know that i am
too fair to be drag befor thi chief of your hearken all i knew
ar dead i am alon except for thi brother i seek oh if you betrai
me mai such a fate fall upon your own daughter also mai she also know
the dai of slaveri and the love that she will not and she ceas
sob
now i turn my head and spoke toward the hut chief i said your
ehlos is kind to you tonight for he ha given you a maid fair as the
lili of the halakaziher nada glanc up wildli come then and
take the girl
now nada turn to snatch up the assegai from the ground but whether to
kill me or the chief she fear so much or herself i do not know and
as she turn in her woe she call upon the name of umslopogaa she
found the assegai and straighten herself again and lo there befor
her stood a tall chief lean on an ax but the old man who threaten
her wa gonenot veri far in truth but round the corner of the hut
now nada the lili look then rub her ey and look again
sure i dream she said at last but now i spoke to an old man and
in hi place there stand befor me the shape of on whom i desir to
see
i thought maiden that the voic of a certain nada call upon on
umslopogaa said he who lean upon the ax
ay i call but where is the old man who treat me so scurvili nai
what doe it matterwher he is there let him stop at least you ar
umslopogaa my brother or should be by your great and the ax to
the man i cannot altogeth swear in thi light but to the ax i can
swear for onc it pass so veri near my ey
thu she spoke on gain time and all the while she watch
umslopogaa till she wa sure that it wa he and no other then she
ceas talk and fling herself on him she kiss him
now i trust that zinita sleep sound murmur umslopogaa for
suddenli he rememb that nada wa no sister of hi as she thought
nevertheless he took her by the hand and said enter sister of all
maiden in the world you ar the most welcom here for know i believ
you dead
but i mopo ran into the hut befor her and when she enter she found
me sit by the fire
now here my brother said nada point at me with her finger
here is that old umfagozan that low fellow who unless i dream but
a veri littl while ago brought shame upon meai my brother he struck
me a maid with hi kerri and that onli becaus i said that i would
stab him for hi insol and he did wors he swore that he would
drag me to some old chief of hi to be a gift to him and thi he
wa about to do had you not come will you suffer these thing to go
unpunish my brother
now umslopogaa smile grimli and i answer
what wa it that you call me just now nada when you prai me to
protect you father wa it not and i turn my face toward the blaze
of the fire so that the full light fell upon it
ye i call you father old man it is not strang for a homeless
wander must find father where she canand yet no it cannot beso
changedand that white hand and yet oh who ar you onc there wa
a man name mopo and he had a littl daughter and she wa call
nadaoh my father my father i know you now
ay nada and i knew you from the first through all your man
wrap i knew you after these mani year
so the lili fell upon my neck and sob there and i rememb that i
also wept
now when she had sob her fill of joi umslopogaa brought nada the
lili mass to eat and meali porridg she at the curdl milk but the
porridg she would not eat sai that she wa too weari
then she told us all the tale of her wander sinc she had fled awai
from the side of umslopogaa at the stronghold of the halakazi and
it wa long so long that i will not repeat it for it is a stori by
itself thi i will sai onli that nada wa captur by robber and for
awhil pass herself off among them as a youth but in the end thei
found her out and would have given her as a wife to their chief onli
she persuad them to kill the chief and make her their ruler thei
did thi becaus of that medicin of the ey which nada had onli among
women for as she rule the halakazi so she rule the robber but at
the last thei all love her and she gave it out that she would wed
the strongest then some of them fell to fight and while thei kill
each otherfor it came about that nada brought death upon the robber
as on all otherssh escap for she said that she did not wish to
look upon their struggl but would await the upshot in a place apart
after that she had mani further adventur but at length she met an old
woman who guid her on her wai to the ghost mountain and who thi old
woman wa none could discov but galazi swore afterward that she wa
the stone witch of the mountain who put on the shape of an ag woman
to guid nada to umslopogaa to be the sorrow and the joi of the peopl
of the ax i do not know my father yet it seem to me that the old
witch would scarc have put off her stone for so small a matter
now when nada had made an end of her tale umslopogaa told hi of how
thing had gone with dingaan when he told her how he had given the bodi
of the girl to the king sai that it wa the lili stalk she said
it had been well done and when he spoke of the slai of the traitor
she clap her hand though nada whose heart wa gentl did not love
to hear of deed of death at last he finish and she wa somewhat
sad and said it seem that her fate follow her and that now the
peopl of the ax were in danger at the hand of dingaan becaus of her
ah my brother she cri take umslopogaa by the hand it were
better i should die than that i should bring evil upon you also
that would not mend matter nada he answer for whether you be
dead or aliv the hate of dingaan also nada know thi i am not your
brother
when the lili heard these word she utter a littl cry and let
fall the hand of umslopogaa clasp mine shrink up against me
what is thi tale father she ask he who wa my twin he with
whom i have been bred up sai that he ha deceiv me these mani year
that he is not my brother who then is he father
he is your cousin nada
ah she answer i am glad it would have griev me had he whom i
love been shown to be but a stranger in whom i have no part and she
smile a littl in the ey and at the corner of her mouth but tell
me thi tale also
so i told her the tale of the birth of umslopogaa for i trust her
ah she said when i had finish ah you come of a bad stock
umslopogaa though it is a kingli on i shall love you littl
henceforth child of the hyena man
then that is bad new said umslopogaa for know nada i desir now
that you should love me more than everthat you should be my wife and
love me as your husband
now the lili face grew sad and sweet and all the hidden mockeri went
out of her talkfor nada love to mock
did you not speak to me on that night in the halakazi cave
umslopogaa of on zinita who is your wife and inkosikaa of the
peopl of the ax
then the brow of umslopogaa darken what of zinita he said it is
true she is my chieftai is it not allow a man to take more than
on wife
so i trust answer nada smile els men would go unw for long
for few maid would marri them who then must labour alon all their
dai but umslopogaa if there ar twenti wive yet on must be
first now thi ha come about hitherto that wherev i have been it
ha been thrust upon me to be first and perhap it might be thu onc
morewhat then umslopogaa
let the fruit ripen befor you pluck it nada he answer if you
love me and will wed me it is enough
i prai that it mai not be more than enough she said stretch out
her hand to him listen umslopogaa ask my father here what were the
word i spoke to him mani year ago befor i wa a woman when with my
mother macropha i left him to go among the swazi peopl it wa after
you had been born awai by the lion umslopogaa i told my father that
i would marri no man all my life becaus i love onli you who were
dead my father reproach me sai that i must not speak thu of my
brother but it wa my heart which spoke and it spoke truli for see
umslopogaa you ar no brother to me i have kept that vow how mani
men have sort me in wedlock sinc i becam a woman umslopogaa i tell
you that thei ar as the leav upon a tree yet i have given myself to
none and thi ha been my fortun that none have sought to constrain
me to marriag now i have my reward for he whom i lost is found again
and to him alon i give my love yet umslopogaa bewar littl luck

who have but sought to look on me
i will bear the risk nada the slaughter answer and gather
her to hi great breast he kiss her
present she slip from hi arm and bade him begon for she wa
weari and would rest
so he went
chapter xxxi the war of the women
now on the morrow at daybreak leav hi wolv galazi came down from
the ghost mountain and pass through the gate of the kraal
in front of my hut he saw nada the lili and salut her for each
rememb the other then he walk on to the place of assembl and
spoke to me
so the star of death ha risen on the peopl of the ax mopo he
said wa it becaus of her come that my grei peopl howl so
strang last night i cannot tell but i know thi the star shone
first on me thi morn and that is my doom well she is fair enough
to be the doom of mani mopo and he laugh and pass on swing
the watcher but hi word troubl me though thei were foolish for i
could not but rememb that wherev the beauti of nada had pleas the
sight of men there men had been given to death
then i went to lead nada to the place of assembl and found her await
me she wa dress now in some woman garment that i had brought her
her curl hair fell upon her shoulder on her wrist and neck and knee
were bracelet of ivori and in her hand she bore a lili bloom which she
had gather as she went to bath in the river perhap she did thi my
father becaus she wish here as elsewher to be known as the lili
and it is the zulu fashion to name peopl from some such trifl but
who can know a woman reason or whether a thing is by chanc alon my
father also she had beg me of a cape i had it wa cunningli made by
basutu of the whitest feather of the ostrich thi she put about her
shoulder and it hung down to her middl it had been a custom with
nada from childhood not to go about as do other girl nake except for
their girdl for she would alwai find some rag or skin to lie upon
her breast perhap it wa becaus her skin wa fairer than that of
other women or perhap becaus she knew that she who hide her beauti
often seem the loveliest or becaus there wa truth in the tale of her
white blood and the fashion came to her with the blood i do not know
my father at the least she did so
now i took nada by the hand and led her through the morn air to the
place of assembl and ah she wa sweeter than the air and fairer than
the dawn
there were mani peopl in the place of assembl for it wa the dai of
the monthli meet of the council of the headmen and there also were
all the women of the kraal and at their head stood zinita now it had
got about that the girl whom the slaughter went to seek in the cave
of the halakazi had come to the kraal of the peopl of the ax and all
ey watch for her
wow said the men as she pass smile look neither to the right
nor to the left yet see allwow but thi flower is fair littl
wonder that the halakazi di for her
the women look also but thei said noth of the beauti of nada thei
scarc seem to see it
that is she for whose sake so mani of our peopl lie unburi said
on
where then doe she find her fine cloth quoth anoth she who
came here last night a footsor wander
feather ar not enough for her look she must bear flower also
sure thei ar fitter to her hand than the handl of a hoe said a
third
now i think that the chief of the peopl of the ax will find on to
worship abov the ax and that some will be left mourn put in a
fourth glanc at zinita and the other women of the household of the
slaughter
thu thei spoke throw word like assegai and nada heard them all
and knew their mean but she never ceas from smile onli zinita
said noth but stood look at nada from beneath her bent brow
while by on hand she held the littl daughter of umslopogaa her
child and with the other plai with the bead about her neck
present we pass her and nada know well who thi must be
turn her ey full upon the angri ey of zinita and held them there
awhil now what there wa in the glanc of nada i cannot sai but i
know that zinita who wa afraid of few thing found someth to fear
in it at the least it wa she who turn her head awai and the lili
pass on smile and greet umslopogaa with a littl nod
hail nada said the slaughter then he turn to hi headmen and
spoke thi is she whom we went to the cave of the halakazi to seek
for dingaan ou the stori is known now on told it up at the kraal
umgugundhlovu who shall tell it no more she prai me to save her from
dingaan and so i did and all would have gone well had it not been for
a certain traitor who is done with for i took anoth to dingaan look
on her now my friend and sai if i did not well to win herth lili
flower such as there is no other in the world to be the joi of the
peopl of the ax and a wife to me
with on accord the headmen answer inde you did well
slaughter for the glamour of nada wa upon them and thei would
cherish her as other had cherish her onli galazi the wolf shook hi
head but he said noth for word do not avail against fate now as
i found afterward sinc zinita the head wife of umslopogaa had
learn of what stock he wa she had known that nada wa no sister to
him yet when she heard him declar that he wa about to take the lili
to wife she turn upon him sai
how can thi be lord
why do you ask zinita he answer is it not allow to a man to
take anoth wife if he will
sure lord she said but men do not wed their sister and i have
heard that it wa becaus thi nada wa your sister that you save her
from dingaan and brought the wrath of dingaan upon the peopl of the
ax the wrath that shall destroi them
so i thought then zinita he answer now i know otherwis nada is
daughter to mopo yonder inde but he is no father to me though he
ha been name so nor wa the mother of nada my mother that is so
councillor
then zinita look at me and mutter o fool of a mouth not for
noth did i fear evil at your hand
i heard the word and took no note and she spoke again to umslopogaa
sai here is a mysteri o lord bulalio will it then pleas you to
declar to us who is your father
i have no father he answer wax wroth the heaven abov ar
my father i am born of blood and fire and she the lili is born of
beauti to be my mate now woman be silent he thought awhil
and ad nai if you will know my father wa indabazimbi the
witchfind the smellerout of the king the son of arpi thi
umslopogaa said at a hazard sinc have deni me he must declar
a father and dare not name the black on who wa gone but in
after year the sai wa taken up in the land and it wa told that
umslopogaa wa the son of indabazimbi the witchfind who had long
ago fled the land nor did he deni it for when all thi game had been
plai out he would not have it known that he wa the son of chaka he
who no longer sought to be a king lest he should bring down the wrath
of panda upon him
when the peopl heard thi thei thought that umslopogaa mock zinita
and yet in hi anger he spoke truth when he said first that he wa
born of the heaven abov for so we zulu name the king and so the
witchdoctor indabazimbi name chaka on the dai of the great smell
out but thei did not take it in thi sens thei held that he
spoke truli when he gave it out that he wa born of indabazimbi the
witchdoctor who had fled the land whither i do not know
then nada turn to zinita and spoke to her in a sweet and gentl voic
if i am not sister to bulalio yet i shall soon be sister to you who
ar the chief inkosikaa zinita shall that not satisfi you and will
you not greet me kindli and with a kiss of peac who have come from
far to be your sister zinita and nada held out her hand toward
her though whether she did thi from the heart or becaus she would
put herself in the right befor the peopl i do not know but zinita
scowl and jerk at her necklac of bead break the string
on which thei were thread so that the bead roll upon the black
earthen floor thi wai and that
keep your kiss for our lord girl zinita said roughli as my bead
ar scatter so shall you scatter thi peopl of the ax
now nada turn awai with a littl sigh and the peopl murmur for
thei thought that zinita had treat her badli then she stretch out
her hand again and gave the lili in it to umslopogaa sai
here is a token of our betroth lord for never a head of cattl
have my father and i to sendw who ar outcast and inde the
bridegroom must pai the cattl mai i bring you peac and love my
lord
umslopogaa took the flower and look somewhat foolish with ith who
wa wont to carri the ax and not a flower and so that talk wa end
now as it chanc thi wa that dai of the year when accord to
ancient custom the holder of the ax must challeng all and sundri to
come up against him to fight in singl combat for groanmak and
the chieftainship of the peopl therefor when the talk wa done
umslopogaa rose and went through the challeng not think that ani
would answer him sinc for some year none had dare to stand befor
hi might yet three men step forward and of these two were
captain and men whom the slaughter love with all the peopl he
look at them astonish
how is thi he said in a low voic to that captain who wa nearest
and who would do battl with him
for answer the man point to the lili who stood by then umslopogaa
understood that becaus of the medicin of nada beauti all men desir
to win her and sinc he who could win the ax would take her also he
must look to fight with mani well fight he must or be shame
of the frai there is littl to tell umslopogaa kill first on man
and then the other and swiftli for grow fear the third did not
come up against him
ah said galazi who watch what did i tell you mopo the curs
begin to work death walk ever with that daughter of your old man
i fear so i answer and yet the maiden is fair and good and
sweet
that will not mend matter said galazi
now on that dai umslopogaa took nada the lili to wife and for awhil
there wa peac and quiet but thi evil thing came upon umslopogaa
that from the dai when he wed nada he hate even to look upon
zinita and not at her alon but on all hi other wive also galazi
said it wa becaus nada had bewitch him but i know well that the
onli witcheri she us were the medicin of her ey her beauti and
her love still it came to pass that henceforward and until she had
long been dead the slaughter love her and her alon and that is a
strang sick to come upon a man
as mai be guess my father zinita and the other women took thi ill
thei wait awhil inde think that it would wear awai then thei
began to murmur both to their husband and in the ear of other peopl
till at length there were two parti in the town the parti of zinita
and the parti of nada
the parti of zinita wa made up of women and of certain men who love
and fear their wive but that of nada wa the greatest and it wa
all of men with umslopogaa at the head of them and from thi divis
came much bitter abroad and quarrel in the hut yet neither
the lili nor umslopogaa heed it greatli nor inde anyth so
lost and well content were thei in each other love
now on a certain morn after thei had been marri three full moon
nada came from her husband hut when the sun wa alreadi high and went
down through the rock gulli to the river to bath on the right of
the path to the river lai the mealiefield of the chief and in
them labour zinita and the other women of umslopogaa weed
the mealiepl thei look up and saw nada pass then work on
sullenli after awhil thei saw her come again fresh from the bath veri
fair to see and have flower twine among her hair and as she walk
she sang a song of love now zinita cast down her hoe
is thi to be born my sister she said
no answer anoth it is not to be born what shall we doshal
we fall upon her and kill her now
it would be more just to kill bulalio our lord answer zinita
nada is but a woman and after the fashion of us women take all that
she can gather but he is a man and a chief and should know wisdom and
justic
she ha bewitch him with her beauti let us kill her said the other
women
nai answer zinita i will speak with her and she went and stood
in the path along which the lili walk sing her arm fold across
her breast
now nada saw her and ceas her song stretch out her hand to
welcom her sai greet sister but zinita did not take it
it is not fit sister she said that my hand stain with toil
should defil your fresh with the scent of flower but i am charg
with a messag on my own behalf and the behalf of the other wive of
our lord bulalio the weed grow thick in yonder corn and we women ar
few now that your love dai ar over will not you come and help us if
you brought no hoe from your swazi home sure we will bui you on
now nada saw what wa meant and the blood pour to her head yet she
answer calmli
i would willingli do thi my sister though i have never labour in
the field for wherev i have dwelt the men have kept me back from all
work save such as the weav of flower or the string of bead
but there is thi against itumslopogaa my husband charg me that i
should not toil with my hand and i mai not disobei my husband
our husband charg you so nada nai then it is strang see now i
am hi head wife hi inkosikaasit wa i who taught him how to win the
ax yet he ha laid no command on me that i should not labour in the
field after the fashion of women i who have born him children nor
inde ha he laid such a command upon ani of our sister hi other
wive can it then be that bulalio love you better than us nada
now the lili wa in a trap and she knew it so she grew bold
on must be most love zinita she said as on must be most
fair you have had your hour leav me mine perhap it will be short
moreov thi umslopogaa and i love each other much long year befor
you or ani of hi wive saw him and we love each other to the end
there is no more to sai
nai nada there is still someth to sai there is thi to sai
choos on of two thing go and leav us to be happi with our lord or
stai and bring death on all
now nada thought awhil and answer did i believ that my love would
bring death on him i love it might well chanc that i would go and
leav him though to do so would be to die but zinita i do not
believ it death chiefli love the weak and if he fall it will be on
the flower not on the slayer of men and she slip past zinita and
went on sing no more
zinita watch her till she wa over the ridg and her face grew evil
as she watch then she return to the women
the lili flout us all my sister she said now listen my counsel
is that we declar a feast of women to be held at the new moon in a
secret place far awai all the women and the children shall come to it
except nada who will not leav her lover and if there be ani man whom
a woman love perhap my sister that man would do well to go on a
journei about the time of the new moon for evil thing mai happen at
the town of the peopl of the ax while we ar awai celebr our
feast
what then shall befal my sister ask on
nai how can i tell she answer i onli know that we ar mind
to be rid of nada and thu to be aveng on a man who ha scorn our
loveai and on those men who follow after the beauti of nada is it
not so my sister
it is so thei answer
then be silent on the matter and let us give out our feast
now nada told umslopogaa of those word which she had bandi
with zinita and the slaughter wa troubl yet becaus of hi
foolish and of the medicin of nada ey he would not turn from
hi wai and wa ever at her side think of littl els except of
her thu when zinita came to him and ask leav to declar a feast
of women that should be held far awai he consent and gladli for
abov all thing he desir to be free from zinita and her angri look
for awhil nor did he suspect a plot onli he told her that nada should
not go to the feast and in a breath both zinita and nada answer that
is word wa their will as inde it wa in thi matter
now i mopo saw the glamour that had fallen upon my fosterl and
spoke of it with galazi sai that a mean must be found to wake him
then i took galazi fulli into my mind and told him all that he did not
know of umslopogaa and that wa littl also i told him of my plan
to bring the slaughter to the throne and of what i had done to that
end and of what i propos to do and thi wa to go in person on a
journei to certain of the great chief and win them over
galazi listen and said that it wa well or ill as the chanc might
be for hi part he believ that the daughter would pull down faster
than i the father could build up and he point to nada who walk
past us follow umslopogaa
yet i determin to go and that wa on the dai befor zinita won leav
to celebr the feast of women so i sought umslopogaa and told him
and he listen indiffer for he would be go after nada and
weari of my talk of polici i bade him farewel and left him to nada
also i bade farewel she kiss me yet the name of her husband wa
mingl with her goodby
now mad ha come upon these two i said to myself well it will
wear off thei will be chang befor i come again
i guess littl my father how chang thei would be
chapter xxxii zinita come to the king
dingaan the king sat upon a dai in the kraal umgugundhlovu wait
till hi impi should return from the incom that is now name the blood
river he had sent them thither to destroi the laager of the boer and
thenc as he thought thei would present return with victori idli
he sat in the kraal watch the vultur wheel abov the hill of
slaughter and round him stood a regiment
my bird ar hungri he said to a councillor

councillor answer
as he spoke on came near sai that a woman sought leav to speak to

i ask blood o king
the blood of whom

now dingaan sprang up and swore an oath by the head of the black on who
wa gone
what he cri doe the lili then live as the soldier thought
she live o king she is wife to the slaughter and becaus of
her witchcraft he ha put me hi first wife awai against all law and

thou comest in a bad hour here i have but on regiment and i think
that the slaughter mai take some kill wait till my impi return

whose ar those children
thei ar my children and the children of bulalio who wa my husband
the children of him whom thou wouldst caus to be slain
yea king
sure woman thou art as good a mother as wife said dingaan now i
have spokenbegon
but the heart of zinita wa hungri for vengeanc vengeanc swift and
terribl on the lili who lai in her place and on her husband who had
thrust her asid for the lili sake she did not desir to waitno
not even for an hour
hearken o king she cri the tale is not yet all told thi man
bulalio plot against thy throne with mopo son of makedama who wa
thy councillor
he plot against my throne woman the lizard plot against the cliff
on which it sun itself then let him plot and as for mopo i will
catch him yet
ye o king but that is not all the tale thi man ha anoth
nameh is name umslopogaa son of mopo but he is no son of mopo
he is son to the black on who is dead the mighti king who wa thy
brother by baleka sister to mopo ye i know it from the lip of
mopo i know all the tale he is heir to thy throne by blood o king
and thou sittest in hi place
for a littl while dingaan sat astound then he command zinita to
draw near and tell him that tale
now behind the stool on which he sat stood two councillor nobl whom
dingaan love and these alon had heard the last word of zinita he
bade these nobl stand in front of him out of earshot and awai from
everi other man then zinita drew near and told dingaan the tale of
the birth of umslopogaa and all that follow and by mani a token and
mani a deed of chaka which he rememb dingaan the king knew that
it wa a true stori
when at length she had done he summon the captain of the regiment
that stood around he wa a great man name faku and he also summon
certain men who do the king bid to the captain of the impi he
spoke sharpli sai
take three compani and guid and come by night to the town of the
peopl of the ax that is by ghost mountain and burn it and slai
all the wizard who sleep therein most of all slai the chief of the
peopl who is name bulalio the slaughter or umslopogaa kill him
by tortur if you mai but kill him and bring hi head to me take that
wife of hi who is known as nada the lili aliv if ye can and bring
her to me for i would caus her to be slain here bring the cattl
also now go and go swiftli thi hour if ye return have fail in
on jot of my command ye die everi on of youy die and slowli
begon
the captain salut and run to hi regiment issu a command
three full compani leapt forward at hi word and ran after him
through the gate of the kraal umgugundhlovu head for the ghost
mountain
then dingaan call to those who do the king bid and point
to the two nobl hi councillor who had heard the word of zinita
command that thei should be kill
the nobl heard and have salut the king cover their face
know that thei must die becaus thei had learn too much so thei
were kill now it wa on of these councillor who had said that
doubtless meat would soon be found to feed the king bird
then the king command those who do hi bid that thei should take
the children of zinita and make awai with them
but when zinita heard thi she cri aloud for she love her children
then dingaan mock her
what he said art thou a fool as well as wick thou sayest that
thy husband whom thou hast given to death is born of on who is dead
and is heir to my throne thou sayest also that these children ar born
of him therefor when he is dead thei will be heir to my throne am
i then mad that i should suffer them to live woman thou hast fallen
into thine own trap take them awai
now zinita tast of the cup which she had brew for other lip and
grew distraught in her miseri and wrung her hand cry that she
repent her of the evil and would warn umslopogaa and the lili of that
which await them and she turn to run toward the gate but the
king laugh and nod and thei brought her back and present she
wa dead also
thu then my father prosper the wicked of zinita the head wife
of umslopogaa my fosterl
now these were the last slai that were wrought at the kraal
umgugundhlovu for just as dingaan had made an end of them and onc more
grew weari he lift hi ey and saw the hillsid black with men who
by their dress were of hi own impimen whom he had sent out against
the boer
and yet where wa the proud arrai where the plume and shield where
the song of victori here inde were soldier but thei walk in
group like women and hung their head like chidden children
then he learn the truth the impi had been defeat by the bank of
the incom thousand had perish at the laager mow down by the gun
of the boer thousand more had been drown in the incom till the
water were red and the bodi of the slain push each other under and
those who still live walk upon them
dingaan heard and wa seiz with fear for it wa said that the
amaboona follow fast on the track of the conquer
that dai he fled to the bush on the black umfolozi river and that night
the sky wa crimson with the burn of the kraal umgugundhlovu where
the eleph should trumpet no more and the vultur were scare from
the hill of slaughter by the roar of the flame
galazi sat on the lap of the stone witch gaze toward the wide plain
below that were yet white with the moon though the night grew toward
the morn greysnout whine at hi side and deathgrip thrust hi
muzzl into hi hand but galazi took no heed for he wa brood on
the fall of umslopogaa from the man that he had been to the level of a
woman slave and on the break up of the peopl of the ax becaus
of the come of nada for all the women and the children were gone to
thi feast of women and would not return for long and it seem to
galazi that mani of the men had slip awai also as though thei smelt
some danger from afar
ah deathgrip said galazi aloud to the wild brute at hi side
chang is the wolf king my brother all chang becaus of a woman
kiss now he hunt no more no more shall groanmak be aloft it is
a woman kiss he crave not the touch of your rough tongu it is a
woman hand he hold not the smooth haft of horn he who of all men
wa the fiercest and the first for thi last shame ha overtaken
him sure chaka wa a great king though an evil and he show hi
great when he forbad marriag to the warrior marriag that make
the heart soft and turn blood to water
now galazi ceas and gaze idli toward the kraal of the peopl of the
ax and as he look hi ey caught a gleam of light that seem
to travel in and out of the edg of the shadow of ghost mountain as
a woman needl travel through a skin now seen and now lost in the
skin
he start and watch ah there the light came out from the shadow
now by chaka head it wa the light of spear
on moment more galazi watch it wa a littl impi perhap thei
number two hundr men run silent but not to battl for thei
wore no plume yet thei went out to kill for thei ran in compani
and each man carri assegai and a shield
now galazi had heard tell of such impi that hunt by night and he knew
well that these were the king dog and their game wa men a big
kraal of sleep men otherwis there had been fewer dog is a whole
pack sent out to catch an antelop on it form galazi wonder whom
thei sought ah now thei turn to the ford and he knew it wa hi
brother umslopogaa and nada the lili and the peopl of the ax these
were the king dog and zinita had let them slip for thi reason she
had call a feast of women and taken the children with her for thi
reason so mani had been summon from the kraal by on mean or anoth
it wa that thei might escap the slaughter
galazi bound to hi feet for on moment he thought might not these
hunter be hunt could he not destroi them by the jaw of the wolv
as onc befor thei had destroi a certain impi of the king ay if
he had seen them but on hour befor then scarc a man of them should
have live to reach the stream for he would have waylaid them with
hi wolv but now it might not be the soldier near the ford and
galazi knew well that hi grei peopl would not hunt on the further
plain though for thi he had heard on reason onli that which wa
given him by the lip of the dead in a dream
what then might be done on thing alon warn umslopogaa yet how
for him who could swim a rush river there wa inde a swifter wai
to the place of the peopl of the axea wai that wa to the path of the
impi as is the bowstr to the strung bow and yet thei had travel
wellnigh half the length of the bow still he might do it he whose
feet were the swiftest in the land except those of umslopogaa at the
least he would try mayhap the impi would tarri to drink at the ford
so galazi thought in hi heart and hi thought wa swift as the light
then with a bound he wa awai down the mountain side from boulder to
boulder he leapt like a buck he crash through the brake like a bull
he skim the level like a swallow the mountain wa travel now
there in front of him lai the yellow river foam in it flood so he
had swum it befor when he went to see the dead ah a good leap far out
into the torrent it wa strong but he breast it he wa through he
stood upon the bank shake the water from him like a dog and now he
wa awai up the narrow gorg of stone to the long slope run low as
hi wolv ran
befor him lai the townon side shone silver with the sink moon
on wa grei with the break dawn ah thei were there he saw them
move through the grass by the eastern gate he saw the long line of
slayer creep to the left and the right
how could he pass them befor the circl of death wa drawn
six spearthrow to run and thei had but such a littl wai the
mealiepl were tall and at a spot thei almost touch the fenc up
the path could umslopogaa hi brother move more fast he wonder
than the wolf who sped to save him he wa there hidden by the meali
stalk and there along the fenc to the right and to the left the
slayer crept
wow what wa that said on soldier of the king to anoth man as
thei join their guard complet the death circl wow someth
great and black crash through the fenc befor me
i heard it brother answer the other man i heard it but i saw
noth it must have been a dog no man could leap so high
more like a wolf said the first at the least let us prai that it
wa not an esedowan 1 who will put us into the hole in it back is
your fire readi brother wow these wizard shall wake warm the signal
should be soon
1 a fabul anim report by the zulu to carri off human be
in a hole in it back
then aros the sound of a great voic cry awak ye sleeper the
foe is at your gate
chapter xxxiii the end of the peopl black and grei
galazi rush through the town cry aloud and behind him rose a stir
of men all slept and no sentinel were set for umslopogaa wa so lost
in hi love for lili that he forgot hi wisdom and thought no more of
war or death or of the hate of dingaan present the wolf came to the
larg new hut which umslopogaa had caus to be built for nada the
lili and enter it for there he knew that he should find hi brother
bulalio on the far side of the hut the two lai sleep and the head
of umslopogaa rest on the lili breast and by hi side gleam the
great ax groanmak
awak cri the wolf
now umslopogaa sprang to hi feet grasp at hi ax but nada threw
her arm wide murmur let me sleep on sweet is sleep
sound shall ye sleep anon gasp galazi swift brother bind on
the wolf hide take shield swift i sayfor the slayer of the king
ar at your gate
now nada sprang up also and thei did hi bid like peopl in a
dream and while thei found their garment and a shield galazi took
beer and drank it and got hi breath again thei stood without the hut
now the heaven wa grei and east and west and north and south tongu
of flame shot up against the sky for the town had been fire by the
slayer
umslopogaa look and hi sens came back to him he understood which
wai brother he said
through the fire and the impi to our grei peopl on the mountain said
galazi there if we can win it we shall find succour
what of my peopl in the kraal ask umslopogaa
thei ar not mani brother the women and the children ar gone i have
rous the menmost will escap henc er we burn
now thei ran toward the fenc and as thei went men join them to the
number of ten half awaken fearstricken armedsom with spear
some with clubsand for the most part nake thei sped on togeth
toward the fenc of the town that wa now but a ring of fire
umslopogaa and galazi in front each hold the lili by a hand thei
near the fencefrom without came the shout of the slayerslo it
wa afir nada shrank back in fear but umslopogaa and galazi drag
her on thei rush at the blaze fenc smite with ax and club it
broke befor them thei were through but littl harm without were a
knot of the slayer stand back a small space becaus of the heat of
the flame the slayer saw them and cry thi is bulalio kill the
wizard sprang toward them with uplift spear now the peopl of the
ax made a ring round nada and in the front of it were umslopogaa
and galazi then thei rush on and met those of the slayer who stood
befor them and the men of dingaan were swept awai and scatter by
groanmak and the watcher as dust is swept of a wind as grass is
swept by a sickl
thei were through with onli on man slain but the cry went up that the
chief of the wizard and the lili hi wife had fled then as it wa
these whom he wa chiefli charg to kill the captain call off the
impi from watch for the dweller in the town and start in pursuit
of umslopogaa now at thi time nearli a hundr men of the peopl of
the ax had been kill and of the slayer some fifti men for have
been awaken by the cry of galazi the soldier of the ax fought
brave though none saw where hi brother stood and none knew whither
their chief had fled except those ten who went with the brethren
meanwhil the wolfbrethren and those with them were well awai and it
had been easi for them to escap who were the swiftestfoot of ani in
the land but the pace of a regiment is the pace of it slowestfoot
soldier and nada could not run with the wolfbrethren yet thei made
good speed and were halfwai down the gorg that led to the river befor
the compani of dingaan pour into it now thei came to the end of it
and the foe wa nearthi end of the gorg is narrow my father like
the neck of a gourdthen galazi stop and spoke
halt ye peopl of the ax he said and let us talk awhil with
these who follow till we get our breath again but you my brother pass

but if perchanc we cannot find you you know what must be done set
the lili in the cave then return and call up the grei impi wow my
brother i must find you if i mai for if these men of dingaan have a
mind for sport there shall be such a hunt on the ghost mountain as
the old witch ha not seen go now my brother
it is not my wai to turn and run while other stand and fight growl
umslopogaa yet becaus of nada it seem that i must
oh heed me not my love said nada i have brought thee sorrowi am
weari let me die kill me and save yourselv
for answer umslopogaa took her by the hand and fled toward the river
but befor he reach it he heard the sound of the frai the warcri of
the slayer as thei pour upon the peopl of the ax the howl of hi
brother the wolf when the battl joinedai and the crash of the
watcher as the blow went home
well bitten wolf he said stop that on shall need no more
oh that i mightbut again he look at nada and sped on
now thei had leap into the foam river and here it wa well that
the lili could swim els both had been lost but thei won through and
pass forward to the mountain flank here thei walk on among the
tree till the forest wa almost pass and at length umslopogaa heard
the howl of a wolf
then he must set nada on hi shoulder and carri her as onc galazi had
carri anoth for it wa death for ani except the wolfbrethren to
walk on the ghost mountain when the wolv were awak
present the wolv flock around him and leap upon him in joi
glare with fierc ey at her who sat upon hi shoulder nada saw
them and almost fell from her seat faint with fear for thei were
mani and dread and when thei howl her blood turn to ic
but umslopogaa cheer her tell her that these were hi dog with
whom he went out hunt and with whom he should hunt present at
length thei came to the knee of the old witch and the entranc to
the cave it wa empti except for a wolf or two for galazi abod here
seldom now but when he wa on the mountain would sleep in the forest
which wa nearer the kraal of hi brother the slaughter
here you must stai sweet said umslopogaa when he had driven out the
wolv here you must rest till thi littl matter of the slayer is
finish would that we had brought food but we had littl time to seek
it see now i will show you the secret of the stone thu far i will
push it no farther now a touch onli is need to send it over the
socket and home but then thei must be two strong men who can pull it
back again therefor push it no farther except in the utmost need lest
it remain where it fall whether you will it or not have no fear you
ar safe here none know of thi place except galazi myself and the
wolv and none shall find it now i must be go to find galazi if
he still live if not to make what plai i can against the slayer
alon with the wolv
now nada wept sai that she fear to be left and that she should
never see him more and her grief rung hi heart nevertheless
umslopogaa kiss her and went close the stone after him in that
fashion of which he had spoken when the stone wa shut the cave wa
almost dark except for a rai of light that enter by a hole littl
larger than a man hand that look at from within wa on the right
of the stone nada sat herself so that thi rai struck full on her for
she love light and without it she would pine as flower do there
she sat and thought in the darksom cave and wa fill with fear and
sorrow and while she brood thu suddenli the rai went out and she
heard a nois as of some beast that smell at prei she look and in
the gloom she saw the sharp nose and grin fang of a wolf that were
thrust toward her through the littl hole
nada cri aloud in fear and the fang were snatch back but
present she heard a scratch without the cave and saw the stone
shake then she thought in her foolish that the wolf knew how to
open the stone and that he would do thi and devour her for she had
heard the tale that all these wolv were the ghost of evil men have
the understand of men so in her fear and folli she seiz the rock
and drag on it as umslopogaa had shown her how to do it shook it
slip over the socket ledg and roll home like a pebbl down the
mouth of a gourd
now i am safe from the wolv said nada see i cannot so much as
stir the stone from within and she laugh a littl then ceas from
laugh and spoke again yet it would be ill if umslopogaa came
back no more to roll awai that rock for then i should be like on in a
gravea on who is place in a grave be yet strong and quick she
shudder as she thought of it but present start up and set her
ear to the hole to listen for from far down the mountain there rose a
mighti howl and a din of men
when umslopogaa had shut the cave he move swiftli down the mountain
and with him went certain of the wolv not all for he had not
summon them hi heart wa heavi for he fear that galazi wa no
more also he wa mad with rage and plot in himself to destroi the
slayer of the king everi man of them but first he must learn what
thei would do present as he wend he heard a long low howl far
awai in the forest then he rejoic for he knew the callit wa the
call of galazi who had escap the spear of the slayer
swiftli he ran call in answer he won the place there seat on a
stone rest himself wa galazi and round him surg the number
of the grei peopl umslopogaa came to him and look at him for he
seem somewhat weari there were flesh wound on hi great breast and
arm the littl shield wa wellnigh hewn to strip and the watcher
show sign of war
how went it brother ask umslopogaa
not so ill but all those who stood with me in the wai ar dead and
with them a few of the foe i alon am fled like a coward thei came on
us thrice but we held them back till the lili wa safe then all our
men be down i ran umslopogaa and swam the torrent for i wa
mind to die here in my own place
now though he said littl of it i must tell you my father that
galazi had made a great slaughter there in the neck of the donga
afterward i count the slain and thei were mani the nine men of the
peopl of the ax were hidden in them
perhap it shall be the slayer who die brother
perhap at least there shall be death for some still it is in my
mind slaughter that our brotherhood draw to an end for the fate of
him who bear the watcher and which my father foretold is upon me
if so farewel while it last our friendship ha been good and it
end shall be good moreov it would have endur for mani a year
to come had you not sought slaughter to make good better and to
complet our joi of fellowship and war with the love of women from that
sourc flow these ill as a river from a spring but so it wa fate
if i fall in thi frai mai you yet live on to fight in mani anoth and
at the last to die glorious with ax aloft and mai you find a brisker
man and a better watcher to serv you in your need should you fall and
i live on i promis thi i will aveng you to the last and guard the
lili whom you love offer her comfort but no more now the foe draw
on thei have travel round about by the ford for thei dare not face
the torrent and thei cri to me that thei ar sworn to slai us or be
slain as dingaan the king command so the fight will be of the
best if inde thei do not run befor the fang of the grei peopl
now chief speak your word that i mai obei it
thu galazi spoke in the circl of the wolv while umslopogaa lean
upon hi ax groanmak and listen to him ay and wept as he
listen for after the lili and me mopo he love galazi most dearli
of all who live then he answer
were it not for on in the cave abov who is helpless and tender i
would swear to you wolf that if you fall on your carcas i will die
and i do swear that should you fall while i live groanmak shall
be busi from year to year till everi man of yonder impi is as you ar
perchanc i did ill galazi when first i hearken to the word of
zinita and suffer women to come between us mai we on dai find a land
where there ar no women and war onli for in that land we shall
grow great but now at the least we will make a good end to thi
fellowship and the grei peopl shall fight their fill and the old
witch who sit aloft wait for the world to die shall smile to see
that fight if she never smile befor thi is my word that we fall
upon the men of dingaan twice onc in the glade of the forest whither
thei will come present and if we ar beaten back then we must stand
for the last time on the knee of the witch in front of the cave where
nada is sai wolf will the grei folk fight
to the last brother so long as on is left to lead them after that
i do not know still thei have onli fang to set against spear
slaughter your plan is good come i am rest
so thei rose and number their flock and all were there though it
wa not as it had been year ago when first the wolfbrethren hunt
on ghost mountain for mani of the wolv had di by men spear when
thei harri the kraal of men and no young were born to them then
as onc befor the pack wa halv and half the shewolv went with
umslopogaa and half the dogwolv went with galazi
now thei pass down the forest path and hid in the tangl of the
thicket at the head of the darksom glen on on each side of the glen
here thei wait till thei heard the footfal of the impi of the king
slayer as it came slowli along seek them in front of the impi went
two soldier watch for an ambush and these two men were the same who
had talk togeth that dawn when galazi sprang between them now also
thei spoke as thei peer thi wai and that then see noth stood
awhil in the mouth of the glen wait the come of their compani and
their word came to the ear of umslopogaa
an aw place thi my brother said on a place full of ghost and
strang sound of hand that seem to press us back and whine as of
invis wolv it is name ghost mountain and well name would
that the king had found other busi for us than the slai of these
sorcerersfor thei ar sorcer inde and thi is the home of their
sorceri tell me brother what wa that which leap between us thi
morn in the dark i sai it wa a wizard wow thei ar all wizard
could ani who wa but a man have done the deed which he who is name
the wolf wrought down by the river yonder and then have escap had
the ax but stai with the club thei would have eaten up our impi
the ax had a woman to watch laugh the other ye it is true thi
is a place of wizard and evil thing methink i see the red ey of
the esedowana glare at us through the dark of the tree and smell
their smell yet these wizard must be caught for know thi my
brother if we return to umgugundhlovu with the king command undon
then there ar stake harden in the fire of which we shall tast the
point if we ar all kill in the catch and some it seem ar
miss alreadi yet thei must be caught sai my brother shall we draw
on the impi is nigh would that faku our captain yonder might find
two other to take our place for in thi thicket i had rather run last
than first well here lead the spoora wondrou mass of wolfspoor
mix with the footprint of men perhap thei ar sometim the on and
sometim the otherwho know my brother it is a land of ghost and
wizard let us on let us on
now all thi while the wolfbrethren had much ado to keep their peopl
quiet for their mouth water and their ey shone at the sight of the
men and at length it could be done no more for with a howl a singl
shewolf rush from her laid and leapt at the throat of the man who
spoke nor did she miss her grip down went wolf and man roll
togeth on the ground and there thei kill each other
the esedowana the esedowana ar upon us cri the other scout
and turn fled toward the impi but he never reach it for with
fear howl the ghostwolv broke their cover and rush on him
from the right and the left and lo there wa noth of him left
except hi spear alon
now a low cry of fear rose from the impi and some turn to fly but
faku the captain a great and brave man shout to them stand firm
children of the king stand firm these ar no esedowana these ar but
the wolfbrethren and their pack what will ye run from dog ye who
have laugh at the spear of men ring round stand fast
the soldier heard the voic of their captain and thei obei hi
voic form a doubl circl a ring within a ring thei look to the
right there groanmak aloft the wolf fang on hi brow the worn
wolfhid stream on the wind bulalio rush upon them like a storm
and with him came hi redei compani thei look to the leftah
well thei know that mighti watcher have thei not heard hi stroke down
by the river and well thei know the giant who wield it like a wand
the wolf king with the strength of ten wow thei ar here see the
peopl black and grei hear them howl their warchant look how thei
leap like waterleap in a foam of fang against the hedg of spear
the circl is broken groanmak ha broken it ha galazi also is
through the doubl ring now must men stand back to back or perish
how long did it last who can sai time fli fast when blow fall
thick at length the brethren ar beaten back thei break out as thei
broke in and ar gone with such of their wolffolk as were left aliv
yet that impi wa somewhat the wors but onethird of those live
who look on the sun without the forest the rest lai smitten torn
mangl dead hidden under the heap of bodi of wild beast
now thi is a battl of evil spirit that live in the shape of wolv
and as for the wolfbrethren thei ar sorcer of the rarest said
faku the captain and such sorcer i love for thei fight furious
yet i will slai them or be slain at the least if there be few of us
left the most of the wolv ar dead also and the arm of the wizard
grow weari
so he move forward up the mountain with those of the soldier who
remain and all the wai the wolv harri them pull down a man
here and a man there but though thei heard and saw them cheer on
their pack the wolfbrethren attack them no more for thei save their
strength for the last fight of all
the road wa long up the mountain and the soldier knew littl of
the path and ever the ghostwolv harri on their flank so it wa
even befor thei came to the feet of the stone witch and began to
climb to the platform of her knee there on her knee as it were thei
saw the wolfbrethren stand side by side such a pair as were not
elsewher in the world and thei seem afir for the sunset beat upon
them and the wolv crept round their feet red with blood and fire
a gloriou pair quoth great faku would that i fought with them
rather than against them yet thei must die then he began to climb to
the knee of the witch
now umslopogaa glanc up at the stone face of her who sat aloft and
it wa alight with the sunset
said i not that the old witch should smile at thi frai he cri
lo she smile up galazi let us spend the remnant of our peopl on
the foe and fight thi fight out man to man with no beast to spoil
it ho blood and greysnout ho deathgrip ho wooddwel grei and
black at them my children
the wolv heard thei were few and thei were sorri to see with
weari and wound but still thei were fierc with a howl for the
last time thei leap down upon the foe tear harri and kill
till thei themselv were dead by the spear everi on of them except
deathgrip who crept back sore wound to die with galazi
now i am a chief without a peopl cri galazi well it ha been
my lot in life so it wa in the halakazi kraal so it is on ghost
mountain at the last and so also shall it be even for the greatest
king when thei come to their end see that thei too must die
alon sai slaughter choos where you will stand to the left or to
the right
now my father the track below separ becaus of a boulder and
there were two littl path which led to the platform of the witch
knee with perhap ten pace between them umslopogaa guard the
lefthand path and galazi took the right then thei wait have
spear in their hand present the soldier came round the rock and
rush up against them some on on path and some on the other
then the brethren hurl their spear at them and kill three men
now the assegai were done and the foe wa on them umslopogaa bend
forward hi long arm shoot out the ax gleam and a man who came on
fall back
on cri umslopogaa
on my brother answer galazi as he draw back the watcher from hi
blow

ground it smite upward befor the spearsman can strike the horn of
groanmak ha sped from chin to brain

two cri galazi from the right

again two men come on on against each to find no better luck the cry
of three pass from brother to brother and after it rise the cry
of four
now faku bid the men who ar left to hold their shield togeth and
push the two from the mouth of the path and thi thei do lose four
more men at the hand of the brethren befor it is done
now we ar on the open ring them round and down with them cri
faku
but who shall ring round groanmak that shine on all side at onc
groanmak who fall heavili no more but peck and peck and peck
like a woodbird on a tree and never peck in vain who shall ring
round those feet swifter than the sassabi of the plain wow he is
here he is there he is a sorcer death is in hi hand and death

umslopogaa the son of chaka and faku the captain of dingaan gaze
on each other thei alon were left stand upon the mountain for the
rest were all down umslopogaa had mani wound faku wa unhurt he wa
a strong man also arm with an ax
faku laugh aloud so it ha come to thi slaughter he said

chapter xxxiv the lili farewel
umslopogaa listen but he made no answer to the word of faku the
captain though he like them well for he would not wast hi breath in
talk and the light grew low
i am readi man of dingaan he said and lift hi ax
now for awhil the two circl round and round each wait for a
chanc to strike present faku smote at the head of umslopogaa but
the slaughter lift groanmak to ward the blow faku crook
hi arm and let the ax curl downward so that it keen edg smote
umslopogaa upon the head sever hi man ring and the scalp
beneath
made mad with the pain the slaughter awok as it were he grasp
groanmak with both hand and struck thrice the first blow hew awai
the plume and shield of faku and drive him back a spear length the
second miss it aim the third and mightiest twist in hi wet hand
so that the ax smote sidewai nevertheless it fell full on the breast
of the captain faku shatter hi bone and sweep him from the
ledg of rock on to the slope beneath where he lai still
it is finish with the daylight said umslopogaa smile grimli
now dingaan send more slayer to seek your slain and he turn to
find nada in the cave
but faku the captain wa not yet dead though he wa hurt to death he
sat up and with hi last strength he hurl the ax in hi hand at
him whose might had prevail against him the ax sped true and
umslopogaa did not see it fly it sped true and it point struck him
on the left templ drive in the bone and make a great hole then
faku fell back dy and umslopogaa threw up hi arm and drop like
an ox drop beneath the blow of the butcher and lai as on dead under
the shadow of a stone
all dai long nada crouch in the cave listen to the sound of war
that crept faintli up the mountain side howl of wolv shout
of men and the clamour of iron on iron all dai long she sat and now
even came apac and the nois of battl drew near swell and
sank and di awai she heard the voic of the wolfbrethren as thei
call to each other like buck name the number of the slain she
heard galazi cry of victori and her heart leapt to it though she
knew that there wa death in the cry then for the last time she heard
the faint ring of iron on iron and the light went out and all grew
still
all grew still as the night there came no more shout of men and
no more clash of arm no howl of wolv no cri of pain or
triumphal wa quiet as death for death had taken all
for awhil nada the lili sat in the dark of the cave sai to herself
present he will come my husband he will sure come the slayer
ar slainh doe not but tarri to bind hi wound a scratch
perchanc here and there ye he will come and it is well for i am
weari of my loneli and thi place is grim and evil
thu she spoke to herself in hope but noth came except the silenc
then she spoke again and her voic echo in the hollow cave now i
will be bold i will fear noth i will push asid the stone and go
out to find him i know well he doe but linger to tend some who ar
wound perhap galazi doubtless galazi is wound i must go and
nurs him though he never love me and i do not love him overmuch who
would stand between me and my husband thi wild wolfman is a foe to
women and most of all a foe to me yet i will be kind to him come i
will go at onc and she rose and push at the rock
why what wa thi it did not stir then she rememb that she had
pull it beyond the socket becaus of her fear of the wolf and that
the rock had slip a littl wai down the neck of the cave umslopogaa
had told her that she must not do thi and she had forgotten hi word
in her foolish perhap she could move the stone no not by the
breadth of a grain of corn she wa shut in without food or water and
here she must bide till umslopogaa came and if he did not come then
she must sure die
now she shriek aloud in her fear call on the name of umslopogaa
the wall of the cave answer umslopogaa umslopogaa and that wa
all
afterward mad fell upon nada my daughter and she lai in the
cave for dai and night nor knew ever how long she lai and with her
mad came vision for she dream that the dead on whom galazi had
told her of sat onc more aloft in hi nich at the end of the cave and
spoke to her sai
galazi is dead the fate of him who bear the watcher ha fallen on
him dead ar the ghostwolv i also am of hunger in thi cave and as
i di so shall you die nada the lili nada star of death becaus of
whose beauti and foolish all thi death ha come about
thi is seem to nada in her mad that the shadow of him who had
sat in the nich spoke to her from hour to hour
it seem to nada in her mad that twice the light shone through
the hole by the rock and that wa dai and twice it went out and that
wa night a third time the rai shone and di awai and lo her mad
left her and she awok to know that she wa dy and that a voic she
love spoke without the hole sai in hollow accent
nada do you still live nada
yea she answer hoars water give me water
next she heard a sound as of a great snake drag itself along
painfulli a while pass then a trembl hand thrust a littl gourd
of water through the hole she drank and now she could speak though
the water seem to flow through her vein like fire
is it inde you umslopogaa she said or ar you dead and do i
dream of you
it is i nada said the voic hearken have you drawn the rock
home
ala ye she answer perhap if the two of us strive at it it
will move
ay if our strength were what it wasbut now still let us try
so thei strove with a rock but the two of them togeth had not the
strength of a girl and it would not stir
give over umslopogaa said nada we do but wast the time that is
left to me let us talk
for awhil there wa no answer for umslopogaa had faint and nada
beat her breast think that he wa dead
present he spoke howev sai it mai not be we must perish
here on on each side of the stone not see the other face for
my might is as water nor can i stand upon my feet to go and seek for
food

ay nada i am pierc to the brain with the point of an ax no fair
stroke the captain of dingaan hurl it at me when i thought him dead
and i fell i do not know how long i have lain yonder under the shadow
of the rock but it must be long for my limb ar wast and those who
fell in the frai ar pick clean by the vultur all except galazi
for the old wolf deathgrip li on hi breast dy but not dead
lick my brother wound and scare the fowl awai it wa the beak
of a vultur who had smelt me out at last that woke me from my sleep
beneath the stone nada and i crept hither would that he had not

while till you perish thu like a trap fox nada and present i

and of the happi hour that we have spent sinc your great ax rang upon
the rock in the halakazi cave and my fear told you the secret of my
womanhood see i thrust my hand through the hole can you not kiss it
umslopogaa
now umslopogaa stoop hi shatter head and kiss the lili littl
hand then he held it in hi own and so thei sat till the endh
without rest hi back against the rock she within ly on her
side her arm stretch through the littl hole thei spoke of their
love and tri to forget their sorrow in it he told her also of the
frai which had been and how it went
ah she said that wa zinita work zinita who hate me and
justli doubtless she set dingaan on thi path
a littl while gone quoth umslopogaa and i hope that your last
breath and mine might pass togeth nada and that we might go togeth
to seek great galazi my brother where he is now i hope that help
will find me and that i mai live a littl while becaus of a certain
vengeanc which i would wreak
speak not of vengeanc husband she answer i too am near to
that land where the slayer and the slain the shedder of blood and the
aveng of blood ar lost in the same dark i would die with love
and love onli in my heart and your name and your onli on my lip
so that if anywher we live again it shall be readi to spring forth to
greet you yet husband it is in my heart that you will not go with me
but that you shall live on to die the greatest of death far awai from

dark of thi cave i saw you umslopogaa a great man gaunt and grei
stricken to the death and the ax groanmak waver aloft and mani
a man dead upon a white and shimmer wai and about you the fair face
of white women and you had a hole in your forehead husband on the
left side
that is like to be true if i live he answer for the bone of my
templ is shatter
now nada ceas speak and for a long while wa silent umslopogaa
wa also silent and torn with pain and sorrow becaus he must lose the
lili thu and she must die so wretchedli for on reason onli that the
cast of faku had rob him of hi strength ala he who had done mani
deed might not save her now he could scarc hold himself upright
against the rock he thought of it and the tear flow down hi face
and fell on to the hand of the lili she felt them fall and spoke
weep not my husband she said i have been all too ill a wife to
you do not mourn for me yet rememb that i love you well and again
she wa silent for a long space
then she spoke and for the last time of all and her voic came in a
gasp whisper through the hole in the rock

love umslopogaa ah i die
umslopogaa could make no answer onli he watch the littl hand he
held twice it open twice it close upon hi own then it open for

dawn i mopo came from my mission back to the kraal of the peopl of
the ax have succeed in my end for that great chief whom i had
gone out to visit had hearken to my word as the light broke i
reach the town and lo it wa a black and a desol
here is the footmark of dingaan i said to myself and walk to and
fro groan heavili present i found a knot of men who were of the
peopl that had escap the slaughter hide in the mealiefield lest
the slayer should return and from them i drew the stori i listen
in silenc for my father i wa grown old in misfortun then i ask
where were the slayer of the king thei repli that thei did not know
the soldier had gone up the ghost mountain after the wolfbrethren
and nada the lili and from the forest had come a howl of beast and
sound of war then there wa silenc and none had been seen to return
from the mountain onli all dai long the vultur hung over it
let us go up the mountain i said
at first thei fear becaus of the evil name of the place but in the
end thei came with me and we follow on the path of the impi of the
slayer and guess all that had befallen it at length we reach

hi sens return to him i caus a great hole to be dug in the floor
of the cave and there in the hole i buri nada my daughter and we
heap lili bloom upon her to keep the earth from her and then close
in her grave for i wa not mind that umslopogaa should look upon her

to follow her also i buri galazi the wolf in the cave and set the
watcher in hi hand and there thei both sleep who ar friend at last

children of umslopogaa did not come back also a spy reach me from
the mahlabatin and told me of the end of zinita and of the flight of
dingaan befor the boer
now when umslopogaa had recov i ask him what he would do and
whether or not i should pursu my plot to make him king of the land
but umslopogaa shook hi head sai that he had no heart that wai he
would destroi a king inde but now he no longer desir to be a
king he sought reveng alon i said that it wa well i also sought
vengeanc and seek togeth we would find it
