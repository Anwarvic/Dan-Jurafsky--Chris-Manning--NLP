author note
it mai be thought that even in a stori of old egypt to repres a ka
or doubl as remain in activ occup of a throne while the
owner of the said doubl goe upon a long journei and achiev sundri
adventur is in fact to take a liberti with doubl yet i believ
that thi is scarc the case the ka or doubl which wiedermann
aptli call the person within the person appear accord to
egyptian theori to have had an exist of it own it did not die
when the bodi di for it wa immort and await the resurrect
of that bodi with which henceforth it would be reunit and dwell
etern to quot wiedermann again the ka could live without the
bodi but the bodi could not live without the ka it wa
materi in just the same wa as the bodi itself also it would seem
that in certain wai it wa superior to and more power than the bodi
sinc the egyptian monarch ar often repres as make offer to
their own ka as though these were god again in the stori of setna
and the magic book translat by maspero and by mr flinder petri
in hi egyptian tale the ka plai a veri distinct part of it own
thu the husband is buri at memphi and the wife in kopto yet the
ka of the wife goe to live in her husband tomb hundr of mile
awai and convers with the princ who come to steal the magic book
although i know no actual preced for it in the case of a
particularli power doubl such as wa given in thi romanc to queen
netertua by her spiritu father amen the greatest of the egyptian
god it seem therefor legitim to suppos that in order to save
her from the abomin of a forc marriag with her uncl and her
father murder the ka would be allow to anticip matter a
littl and to plai the part record in these page
it must not be understood howev that the fact of marriag with an
uncl would have shock the egyptian mind sinc these peopl and
especi their royal hous made a habit of wed their own
brother and sister as in thi tale merm wed hi half sister asti
i mai add that there is author for the magic waxen imag which the
sorcer kaku and hi accomplic us to bewitch pharaoh in the dai of
rames iii over three thousand year ago a plot wa made to murder
the king in pursuanc of which such imag were us god of wax
for enfeebl the limb of peopl which were great crime of
death the great abomin of the land also a certain magic roll
wa brought into plai which enabl it user to emploi the magic power
of the god
still the end of these wizard wa not encourag to other for thei
were found guilti and oblig to take their own live
but even if i am held to have stretch the prerog of the ka
or of the waxen imag which by the wai ha surviv almost to our own
time and in west africa as a fetish is still pierc with pin or
nail i can urg in excus that i have tri so far as a modern mai
to reproduc someth of the atmospher and colour of old egypt as
it ha appear to a travel in that countri and a student of it
record if netertua never sat upon it throne at least anoth
daughter of amen a mighti queen hatshepu wore the crown of the upper
and the lower land and sent her embassi to search out the mysteri
of punt of romanc also in high place there must have been
abund though the shortcut record of the religi text of the
priest do not troubl themselv with such matter
at ani rate so believ in the hope that it mai interest reader
of todai i have ventur to discov and present on such romanc
whereof the motiv we mai be sure is more ancient by far than the
old egyptian name the triumph of true love over great difficulti
and danger it is pleasant to dream that the god ar on the side of
such lover and deign for their sake to work the miracl in which for
thousand of year mankind ha believ although the scientist tell us
that thei do not happen
how larg a part marvel and magic of the most terribl and exalt kind
plai in the life of old egypt and of the nation with which she fought
and trade we need go no further than the book of exodu to learn
also all her histori is full of it sinc among the egyptian it wa an
articl of faith that the divin which thei worship under so mani
name and symbol made us of such mysteri mean to influenc or
direct the affair of men and bring about the accomplish of it

promis of the priceless cup which he had long covet kaku bow
obsequi he pick up hi crumpl roll and wa about to retir
when through the gloom of the fall night some men mount upon ass
were seen ride over the mud flat that border the nile at thi spot
toward that bank where the ship wa moor
the captain of my guard said abi who saw the starlight gleam upon
a bronz helmet who bring me pharaoh answer nai go not bide and
hear it kaku and give us your counsel on it your true counsel
so the astrolog stood asid and wait till present the captain
appear salut
what sai pharaoh my brother ask the princ
lord he sai that he will receiv you though as he did not send for
you he think that you can scarc come upon ani necessari errand
as he ha heard long ago of your victori over the desertdwel
barbarian and doe not want the offer of the salt head of their
offic which you bring to him
good said abi contemptu the divin pharaoh wa ever a woman in
such matter as in other let him be thank that he ha gener who
know how to make war and to cut off the head of hi enemi in defenc
of the kingdom we will wait upon him tomorrow
lord ad the captain that is not all pharaoh messag he sai
that it ha been report to him that you ar accompani by a guard of
three hundr soldier these soldier he refus to allow within the
gate he direct that you shall appear befor hi majesti attend by
five person onli
inde answer abi with a scorn laugh doe pharaoh fear then
lest i should captur him and hi armi and the great citi with three
hundr soldier
no princ answer the captain bluntli but i think he fear lest
you should kill him and declar yourself pharaoh as next in blood
ah said abi as next of blood then i suppos that there ar still
no children at the court
none o princ i saw ahura the royal wife the ladi of the two land
that fairest of women and other lesser wive and beauti slave girl
without number but never a on of them had an infant on her breast or
at her knee pharaoh remain childless
ah said abi again then he walk forward out of the pavilion whereof
the curtain were drawn back and stood a while upon the prow of the
vessel
by now night had fallen and the great moon rise from the earth as it
were pour her flood of silver light over the desert the mountain
the limitless citi of thebe and the wide rippl bosom of the nile
the pylon and obelisk glitter with copper and with gold tower
to the tender sky in the window place of palac and of ten thousand
home lamp shone like star from garden street and the court of
templ float the faint sound of sing and of music while on the
great embattl wall the watchmen call the hour from post to post
it wa a wondrou scene and the heart of abi swell as he gaze upon
it what wealth lai yonder and what power there wa the gloriou hous
of hi brother pharaoh the god in human form who for all hi godship
had never a child to follow after him when he ascend to osiri as he
who wa sickli probabl must do befor so veri long
ye but befor then a miracl might happen in thi wai or in that a
successor to the throne might be found and acknowledg for were not
pharaoh and hi hous belov by all the priest of amen and by the
peopl and wa not he abi fear and dislik becaus he wa fierc
and the hate savag blood flow in hi vein oh what evil god had
put it in hi father heart to give him a princess of the hykso for a
mother the hykso whom the egyptian loath when he had the fairest
women of the world from whom to choos well it wa done and could
not be undon though becaus of it he might lose hi heritag of the
greatest throne in all the earth also wa it not to thi fierc hykso
blood that he ow hi strength and vigour
why should he wait why should he not set hi fortun on a cast he had
three hundr soldier with him pick men and brave children of the
sea and the desert sworn to hi hous and interest it wa a time of
festiv those gate were illguard why should he not forc them
at the dead of night make hi wai to the palac caus pharaoh to be
gather to hi father and at the dawn discov himself seat upon
pharaoh throne at the thought of it abi heart leapt in hi breast
hi wide nostril spread themselv and he erect hi strong head as
though alreadi he felt upon it the weight of the doubl crown then he
turn and walk back to the pavilion
i am mind to strike a blow he said sai now my offic would you
and the soldier follow me into the heart of yonder citi tonight to win
a throneor a grave if it were the first you should be the gener
of all my armi and you astrolog should becom vizier ye after
pharaoh you two should be the greatest men in all the land
thei look at him and gasp
a venturesom deed princ said the captain at length yet with such
a prize to win i think that i would dare it though for the soldier
i cannot speak first thei must be told what is on foot and out of so
mani how know we that the heart of on or more would not fail a word
from a traitor and befor thi time tomorrow the embalm or the
jackal would be busi
abi heard and look from him to hi companion
princ said kaku put such thought from you buri them deep let
them rise no more in the heaven i read someth of thi busi
but then i did not understand but now i see the black depth of hell
open beneath our feet ye hell would be our home if we dare to
lift hand against the divin person of the pharaoh i sai that the god
themselv would fight against us let it be princ let it be and you
shall have mani year of rule who if you strike now will win noth
but a crown of shame a nameless grave and the everlast torment of
the damn
as he spoke abi consid the man face and saw that all craft had
left it thi wa no charlatan that spoke to him but on in earnest who
believ what he said
so be it he answer i accept your judgment and will wait upon my
fortun moreov you ar both right the thing is too danger
and evil often fall on the head of those who shoot arrow at a god
especi if thei have not enough arrow let pharaoh live on while i
make readi perhap tomorrow i mai work upon him to name me hi heir
the astrolog sigh in relief nor did the captain seem disappoint
my head feel firmer on my shoulder than it did just now he said
and doubtless there ar time when wisdom is better than valour
sleep well princ pharaoh will receiv you tomorrow two hour after
sunris have we your leav to retir
if i were wise said abi finger the hilt of hi sword as he spoke
you would both of you retir for ever who know all the secret of my
heart and with a whisper could bring doom upon me
now the pair look at each other with frighten ey and like hi
master the captain began to plai with hi sword
life is sweet to all men princ he said significantli and we have
never given you caus to doubt us
no answer abi had it been otherwis i should have struck first
and spoken afterward onli you must swear by the oath which mai not be
broken that in life or death no word of thi shall pass your lip
so thei swore both of them by the holi name of osiri the judg and
the redeem
captain said abi you have serv me well your pai is doubl and
i confirm the promis that i made to youshould i ever rule yonder you
shall be my gener
while the soldier bow hi thank the princ said to kaku
master of the star my gold cup is your is there aught els of mine
that you desir

just now
how do you know that i box her ear ask abi quickli did the
star tell you that also well i am tire of the sly hussytak her
soon i think she will box your

contempt but within it dwelt the proud spirit of the descend of
a hundr king
abi advanc to the step of the throne and knelt there till after a
littl paus pharaoh stretch out the sceptr in hi hand for him to
kiss then he spoke in hi light quick voic
welcom princ and my brother he said we quarrel long ago

yield up the scourg of osiri whereof you speak to him who lent it
me but enough of myself let us to busi afterward we will talk
of such matter togeth why have you left your govern at memphi
without leav ask to visit me here in my citi of the gate
be not wrath with me answer abi humbl a while ago in obedi
to your divin command i attack the barbarian who threaten your
dominion in the desert like menthu god of war i fell upon them
i took them by surpris i smote them thousand of them bit the dust
befor me two of their king i captur with their womenthei wait
without to be slain by your majesti i bring with me the head of
a hundr of their captain and the hand of five hundr of their
soldier in earnest of the truth of my word let them be spread out
befor you i report to your divin majesti that those barbarian ar no
more that for a gener at least i have made the land safe to your
uttermost dominion in the north suffer that the head and the hand be
brought in and count out befor your majesti that the smell of them
mai rise like incens to your divin nostril
no no said pharaoh my offic shall count them without for i
love not such sight of death and i take your word for the number what
payment do you ask for thi servic my brother for with great gift
would i reward you who have done so well for me and egypt
befor he answer abi look at the beauti queen ahura who sat at
pharaoh side and at the other royal consort and women
your majesti he said i see here mani wive and ladi but royal
children i do not see grantfor doubtless thei ar in their own
chambersgr o pharaoh that thei mai be led hither that my ey mai
feed upon their loveli and that i mai tell of them each of them
to their cousin who await me at memphi
at these word a flush as of shame spread itself over the love face of
ahura the royal wife the ladi of the two land while the women turn
their head awai whisper to each other bitterli for the insult hurt
them onli pharaoh set hi pale face and answer with digniti
princ abi to affront those whom the god have smitten be thei king
or peasant is an unworthi deed which the god will not forget you
know well that i have no children why then do you ask me to show you
their loveli
i had heard rumour o pharaoh answer the princ no more inde
i did not believ them for where there ar so mani wive i wa certain
that there would be some mother therefor i ask to be sure befor
i proffer a petit which now i will make to you not for my own sake
but for egypt and your o pharaoh have i your leav to speak here in
public
speak on said pharaoh sternli let aught that is for the welfar of
egypt be heard by egypt
your majesti ha told me repli abi bow that the god be
wrath have deni you children not so much as on girl of your blood
have thei given to you to fill your throne after you when in due season
it pleas you to depart to osiri were it otherwis were there even
but a singl womanchild of your divin race i would sai noth i
would be silent as the grave but so it is and though your queen be
fair and mani so it would seem that it must remain sinc the ear of
the god have been deaf to your plead for so long although you
have built them gloriou templ and made them offer without count
will scarc now be open even amen your father amen whose name you
bear will perform no miracl for you o pharaoh who ar so great that
he ha decre that you shall shine alon like the full moon at night
not share your glori with a singl star
now ahura the queen who all thi while had been listen intent
spoke for the first time in a quick angri voic sai
how know you that princ of memphi sometim the god relent and
that which thei have withheld for a space thei give my lord live and
i live and a child of hi mai yet fill the throne of egypt
it mai be so o queen said abi bow and for my part i prai that
it will be so for who am i that i should know the purpos of the king
of heaven if but on girl be born of you and pharaoh then i take
back my word and give to you that titl which for mani year ha been
written fals upon your throne and monument the titl of royal
mother
now ahura would have answer again for thi sneer taunt stung her

chapter iii
rame the princess and the crocodil
at the appoint time to ahura the royal wife wa born a child a
girl with a fresh and love face and wave hair and ey that from the
first were blue like the summer sky at even also on her breast wa a
mole of the length of a finger nail which mole wa shape like the holi
sign of life
now pharaoh and hi hous and the priest in everi templ and inde
all egypt went mad with joi though there were mani who in secret
mourn over the sex of the infant whisper that a man and not a
woman should wear the doubl crown but in public thei said noth
sinc the stori of thi child had gone abroad and folk declar that it
wa sent by the god and divin and that the goddess isi nepthi
and hathor with khemu the maker of mankind were seen in the birth
chamber glow like gold
also pharaoh issu a decre that wherev the name of the queen ahura
wa graven in all the land to it should be ad the titl by the
will of amen mother of hi morn star and that a new hall should be
built in the templ of amen in the northern apt and all about it carv
the stori of the come of princ abi and of the vision of the queen
but ahura never live to see thi gloriou place sinc from the hour of
her daughter birth she began to sink on the fourteenth dai the dai
of purif she bade the nurs bring the beauti babe and gaze
at it long and bless it and spoke with the ka or doubl of the child
which she said she saw ly on her arm besid it bid that ka
protect it well through the danger of life and death until the hour of
resurrect then she said that she heard amen call to her to pai
the price which she had promis for the gift of the divin child the
price of her own life and smile upon pharaoh her husband and di
happili with a radiant face
now joi wa turn to mourn and dure all the dai of embalm
egypt wept for ahura until at length the time came when her bodi wa
row across the nile to the splendid tomb which she had made readi in
the vallei of the queen caus mason and artist to labour at it
without ceas for ahura knew from the dai of her vision that she wa
doom to die and rememb that the tomb of the dead remain as the
live hand leav them sinc few wast gold and toil upon the etern
hous of on who is dead
so ahura wa buri with great pomp and all her jewel and pharaoh who
mourn her truli made splendid offer in the chapel of her tomb
and have laid in the mouth of it the funer boat in which she wa
born across the nile he built it up for ever and pour sand over the
rock so that none should find it place until the dai of awaken
meanwhil the infant grew and flourish and when it wa six month
old wa taken to the colleg of the priestess of amen there to be
rear and taught
now on the dai of the birth of the princess netertua there happen
anoth birth with which our stori ha to do the captain of the
guard of the templ of amen wa on merm who had marri hi own
halfsist asti the enchantress as wa well known thi merm wa
by right and true descent the last of that hous of pharaoh which had
fill the throne of egypt until their line wa cast down gener
befor by the dynasti that now rule the land whereof the reign
pharaoh and hi daughter netertua alon remain a long while past in
the earli dai of hi reign hi council ha whisper in pharaoh ear
that he should kill merm and hi sister lest a dai should come when
thei rebel against him proclaim that thei did so by right of
blood but pharaoh who wa gentl and hate murder instead of slai
merm sent for him and told him all
then merm a noblelook man as becam the stock from which he
sprang prostrat himself and said
o pharaoh why should you kill me it ha pleas the god to debas
my hous and to set up your have i ever lift up my heel against you
becaus my forefath were king or plot with the discont to
overthrow you see i am satisfi with my station which is that of a
nobl and a soldier in your armi therefor let me and my halfsist
the wise ladi asti whom i purpos to marri dwell on in peac as your
true and humbl servant dip not your hand in our innoc blood
o pharaoh lest the god send a curs upon you and your hous and our
ghost come back from the grave to haunt you
when pharaoh heard these word hi heart wa move in him and he
stretch out hi sceptr for merm to kiss therebi grant to him
life and protect
merm he said you ar an honour man and my equal in blood if
not in place for their own purpos the god rais up on and cast down
anoth that at last their end mai be fulfil i believ that you
will work no harm against me and mine and therefor i will work no
harm against you and your sister asti mistress of magic rather shall
you be my friend and counsellor
then pharaoh offer high rank and offic to him but merm would not
take them answer that if he did envi would be stir up against
him and in thi wai or that bring him to hi death sinc tall tree
ar the first to fall so in the end pharaoh made merm captain of the
guard of amen and gave him land and hous enough to enabl him to
live as a nobl of good estat but no more also he becam a friend of
pharaoh and on of hi inner council to whose voic he alwai listen
for merm wa a trueheart man
afterward merm marri asti but like pharaoh for a long while he
remain childless sinc he took no other wive on the dai of the
birth of the princess tua the morn star of amen howev asti bore
a son a royallook child of great strength and beauti and veri fair
in colour as tradit said that the king of hi race had been befor
him but with black and shine ey
see said the midwif here is a head shape to wear a crown
whereon asti hi mother forget her caution in her joi or perhap
inspir by the god for from her childhood she wa a prophetess
answer
ye and i think that thi head and a crown will come close togeth
and she kiss him and name him rame after her royal forefath the
founder of their line
as it chanc a spy overheard thi sai and report it to the
council and the council urg pharaoh to caus the boi to be put awai
as thei had urg in the case of hi father merm becaus of the
word of omen that asti had spoken and becaus she had given her son a
royal name name him after the majesti of ra as though he were inde
the child of a king but pharaoh would not ask with hi soft smile
whether thei wish him to baptis hi daughter in the blood of anoth
infant who drew hi first breath upon the same dai and ad
ra shed hi glori upon all and thi highborn boi mai live to be a
friend in need to her whom amen ha given to egypt let thing befal as
the god decre who am i that i should make myself a god and destroi a
life that thei have fashion
so the boi rame live and throve and merm and asti when thei came
to hear of these thing thank pharaoh and bless him
now the hous of merm as captain of the guard wa within the wall of
the great templ of amen near to the palac of the priestess of amen
where the princess netertua wa nurtur thu it came about that when
the queen ahura di the ladi asti wa name as nurs to the princess
sinc pharaoh said that she should drink no milk save that of on in
whose vein ran royal blood so asti wa tua foster mother and
night by night she slept in her arm togeth with her own son rame
afterward too when thei were wean the babe were taught to walk and
speak togeth and later as children thei becam playmat
thu from the first these two love each other as brother and sister
love when thei ar twin but although the boi wa bold and brave thi
littl princess alwai had the masteri of him not becaus she wa a
princess and heir to the throne of egyptfor all the high titl
thei gave her fell idli on her ear nor did she think anyth of
the bow of courtier and of priestsbut from some strength within
herself she it wa that set the game thei plai and when she talk
he wa oblig to listen for although she wa so sound and healthi
thi tua differ from other children
thu she had what she call her silent hour when she would suffer no
on to come near her not her ladi or her fostermoth asti herself
nor even rame then follow by the women at a distanc she would
wander among the great column of the templ and studi the sculptur
on the wall and sinc all place were open to her pharaoh child
enter the sanctuari and stare at the god that sat in them fashion
in granit and in alabast thi she would do even in the solemn
moonlight when mortal were afraid to approach these sacr shrine and
come thenc unconcern and smile
what do you see there o morn star ask littl rame of her onc
thei ar dull thing those stone god that have never move sinc the
begin of the world also thei frighten me especi when ra is
set
thei ar not dull and thei do not frighten me answer tua thei
talk to me and although i cannot understand all thei sai i am happi
with them
talk he said contemptu how can stone talk
i do not know i think it is their spirit that talk tell me
stori which happen befor i wa born and that shall happen after
i am dead ye and after thei seem to be dead now be silenti sai
that thei talk to meit is enough
for me it would be more than enough said the boi but then i am not
call child of amen who onli worship menthu god of war
when rame wa seven year of ag everi morn he wa taken to school
in the templ where the priest taught him to write with pen of reed
upon tablet of wood and told him more about the god of egypt than he
ever want to hear again dure these hour except when she wa be
instruct by the great ladi of the court or by highpriestess
tua wa left solitari sinc by the command of pharaoh no other children
were allow to plai with her perhap becaus there were none in the
templ of her ag whose birth wa nobl
onc when he came back from hi school in the even rame ask her
if she had not been lone without him she answer no as she had
anoth companion
who is it he ask jealous show me and i will fight him
no on that you can see rame she repli onli my own ka
your ka i have heard of ka but i never saw on what is it like
just like me except that it throw no shadow and onli come when i
am quit by myself and then although i hear it often i see it rare
for it is mix up with the light
i dont believ in ka exclaim rame scornfulli you make them up
out of your head
a littl while after thi talk someth happen that caus rame to
chang hi mind about ka or at ani rate the ka of tua in a hidden
court of the templ wa a deep pool of water with cement side where
it wa said live a sacr crocodil an enorm beast that had
dwelt there for hundr of year rame and tua have heard of thi
crocodil often talk of it and long to see it but could not for
there wa a high wall round the tank and in it a door of copper that
wa kept lock except when onc in everi eight dai the priest took
in food to the crocodileliv goat and sheep and sometim a calf
none of which ever came back again
now on dai rame watch them return saw the priest who wa call
guardian of the door put hi hand behind him to thrust the kei with
which he had just lock the door into hi wallet and miss the
mouth of the wallet let it fall upon the sand then go upon hi wai
know noth of what he had done
when he had gone in a great hurri for he wa a fat old priest and the
dinner hour wa at hand rame pounc upon the kei and hid it in hi
robe then he sought out the princess and said
morn star thi even when i come back from school and am allow
to plai with you we can look at the wonder beast in the tank for
look i have the kei which that fat priest will not search for till
seven dai ar gone by befor which i can take it to him sai that i
found it in the sand or perhap put it back into hi wallet
when she heard thi tua ey shone sinc abov all thing she desir
to see thi holi monster but in the even when the boi came run
to her eagerlyfor he had thought of noth but the crocodil all
dai and had bought a pigeon from a schoolfellow with which to feed the
bruteh found tua in a differ mood
i dont think that we will go to see the holi crocodil rame she
said look at him thoughtfulli
why not he ask amaz there is no on about and i have put fat
upon the kei so that it will make no nois
becaus my ka ha been with me rame and told me that it is a bad act
and if we do troubl will come to us
oh mai the fiend set take your ka repli the lad in a rage show
it to me and i will talk with it
i cannot rame for it is me moreov if set took it he would
take me also and you ar wick to wish such a thing
now the boi began to cry with vexat sob out that she wa not to
be trust and that he had paid awai hi bronz knife which pharaoh
had given him when last he visit the templ for a pigeon to tempt the
beast to the top of the water so that thei might see it although the
knife wa worth mani pigeon and pharaoh would be angri if he heard
that he had part with it
why should we take the life of a poor pigeon to pleas ourselv
ask tua soften a littl at the sight of hi grief
it taken alreadi he answer it flutter so that i had to sit on
it to hide it from the priest and when he had gone it wa dead look
and he open the linen bag he held and show her the dove cold and
stiff
as you did not mean to kill it that make a differ said tua
judici well perhap my ka did not mean that we should not have
on peep and it is a piti to wast the poor pigeon which then will
have di for noth
rame agre that it would be the greatest of piti so the two
children slip awai through the tree of the garden into the shadow of
the wall along which thei crept till thei came to the bronz door then
guiltili enough rame put the great kei into the lock and with the help
of a piec of wood which he had also made readi that he set in the ring
of the kei to act as a lever the two of them turn togeth shot back
the heavi bolt
take out the kei lest it should betrai them thei open the door
a littl and squeez themselv through into the forbidden place no
sooner had thei done so than almost thei wish themselv back again
for there wa someth about the spot that frighten them to sai
noth of the horribl smell which made tua feel ill it wa a great
tank with a littl artifici island in it centr full of slimi water
that look almost black becaus of the shadow of the high wall and
round it ran a narrow stone path at on spot in thi path howev
where grew some danklook tree and bush wa a slope also of
stone and on the slope with it prow rest in the water a littl
boat and in the boat oar but of the crocodil there wa noth to

so thei walk round the tank but wherev it might lurk the sleep
crocodil refus to wake
let us get into the boat and look for it suggest rame perhap it
is hide on the island
so he led her to the stone slope where to her horror tua saw the
remain of the crocodil last meal a sight that caus her to forget
her doubt and jump into the boat veri quickli then rame gave it a
push and sprang in after her so that thei found themselv float
on the water now stand in the bow the boi took an oar and paddl
round the island but still there were no sign of the crocodil
i dont believ it is here at all he said recov hi courag

smell felt her curios return
thi wa a good thought upon which rame act at onc take the dead
bird from the bag he spread out it wing to make it look as though

she made no answer onli her lip seem to shape themselv to a
certain sound that thei did not utter the two women look each other
in the ey then asti shook her head
it mai not be she whisper for mani reason and amongst them that
by the solemn decre of long ago whereof i have told you our blood is

and over them thi veil and follow meif you dare
along narrow passag thei crept and down mani a secretstair till at
length thei came to a door at the foot of a long slope of rock
thi door asti unlock and thrust open then when thei had enter
relock it behind them
what is thi place whisper tua
the burial crypt of the high priestess of amen where it is said that
the god watch none have enter it for hard on thirti year see here
in the dust run the footstep of those who bore the last priestess to
her rest
she held up her lamp and by the light of it tua saw that thei were in a
great cave paint with figur of the god which had on either side of
it recess in each of these wa set a coffin with a gild face and
behind it an alabast statu of her who lai therein and in front of
it a tabl of offer at the head of the crypt stood a small altar of
black stone for the rest the place wa empti
asti led tua to a step in front of the altar and bid her kneel
depart with the lamp which she hid awai in some side chapel so that
now the dark wa intens present through the utter silenc tua
heard her creep back toward her for although she walk so softli the
dust seem to cry beneath her feet and her everi footstep echo round
the vault wall moreov a glow came from her the glow of her life
in that place of death she pass tua and knelt by the altar and the
echo of her movement di awai onli it seem to tua that from each of
the tomb to the right and to the left rose the ka of her who wa buri
there and drew near to watch and listen she could not see them she
could not hear them yet she knew that thei were there and wa abl to
count their numberthirti and two in allwhil within herself rose
a pictur of them each differ from the other but all white
expect solemn
now tua heard asti murmur secret invoc that she did not
understand in that place and silenc thei sound weird and dread
and as she hearken to them for the first time fear crept over her
kneel there upon her knee she bent her head almost to the dust
and put up prayer to amen that he might be pleas to hear her and to
satisfi the long of her heart she prai and prai till she grew
faint and weari while alwai asti utter her invoc but no
answer came no deiti appear no voic spoke at length asti rose and
come to her whisper in her ear
let us depart er the watch spirit whose rest we have broken grow
wrath with us the god ha shut hi ear
so tua rose cling to asti for now she knew not why her fear grew
and deepen for a moment she stood upon her feet then sank to her
knee again for there at the far end of the great tomb near to the
door by which thei had enter appear a glow upon the dark
slowli it took form the form of a woman clad in the royal robe of
egypt and bear in it hand a sceptr the figur of light advanc
toward them so that present thei saw it face tua did not know the
face though it seem to her to be like her own but asti knew it and
at the sight sank to the ground
now the figur stood in front of them a thing of light frame in the
thick dark and now in a sweet low voic it spoke
hail queen of egypt it said hail netertua daughter of amen art
thou afraid to look on the spirit of her who bore thee thou that didst
dare to summon the father of the god to do thy bid
i am afraid answer tua shake in all her limb
and thou asti the magician art thou afraid also who but now wast
bold enough to cry to amenracom from thy high heaven and make

you both that had the god arisen as in your wicked ye will

merci and in hi place ha sent me hi messeng that ye mai live to
look upon tomorrow sun
let amen pardon us gasp tua it wa my sin o mother for i

am torn with doubt and fear for myself and for anoth i would know
the futur
why o queen netertua why wouldst thou know the futur if hell yawn
beneath thy feet why wouldst thou peep through it golden door befor
the time the futur is hid from mortal becaus could thei pierc it

asti crept forward and the glow shape in the royal robe bent over
her so that the light of it shone upon her face it bent over her and
seem to whisper in her ear then it held out it hand toward tua as
though in bless and instantli wa not

chapter v
how rame fought the princ of kesh
now for a whole moon there were great festiv in thebe and in all of
these netertua gloriou in ra hathor strong in beauti morn
star of amen must take her part as newcrown queen of egypt feast
follow feast and at each of them on of the suitor of her hand wa
the guest of honour
then after it wa done pharaoh her father and hi councillor would
wait upon her and ask if thi man wa pleas to her be wise tua
would give no direct answer onli of most of them she wa rid in thi
wai
she demand that the write of the dream of her mother ahura should
be brought and read befor her and when it had been read she point
out that amen promis to her a royal lover and that these chief and
gener were not royal therefor it wa not of them that amen spoke
nor did she dare to turn her ey on on whom the god had forbidden to
her
of other who declar that thei were king but who be unabl to
leav their countri were repres by ambassador she said that
not have seen them she could sai noth when thei appear at the
court of egypt she would consid them
so at length onli on suitor wa left the man whom she knew well
pharaoh and hi councillor desir that she should take as husband
thi wa amathel the princ of kesh whose father an ag king rule
at napata a great citi far to the south situat in a land that wa
call an island becaus the river nile embrac it in it two arm
it wa said that after egypt thi countri wa the richest in the whole
world for there gold wa so plenti that men thought it of less valu
than copper and iron also there were mine in which beauti stone
were found and the soil grew corn in abund
moreov onc in the far past a race of pharaoh sprung from thi citi
of napata had sat on the throne of egypt until at length the peopl of
egypt head by the priest had risen and overthrown them becaus
thei were foreign and had introduc nubian custom into the land
therefor it wa decre by an unalter law that none of their race
should ever again wear the doubl crown of the descend of these
pharaoh rame tua playmat wa the last law child
but although the egyptian had cast them down at heart thei alwai
griev over the rich territori of napata which wa lost to them for
when those pharaoh fell kesh declar itself independ and set up
anoth dynasti to rule over it of which dynasti amathel princ of kesh
wa the heir
therefor thei hope that it might come back to them by marriag between
amathel and the young queen netertua ever sinc she wa born the great
lord and councillor of egypt ye and pharaoh himself see that he
had no son to whom he might marri her after the fashion of the countri
had been work to thi end it wa by secret treati that the princ
amathel wa present at the crown of the queen of whose hand he had
been assur on the sole condit that he came to dwell with her at
thebe it is true that there were other suitor but these as all of
them knew well were but pawn in a game plai to amus the peopl
the king destin to take the great queen captiv wa amathel and no
other tua knew it for had not asti told her and wa it not becaus of
her fear of thi man and her love for rame that she had dare to commit
the sacrileg of attempt to summon amen from the ski still as
yet the pharaoh had not spoken to her of amathel nor had she met him
it wa said that he had been present at her crown in disguis for
thi proud princ gave out that were she ten time queen of egypt
he would not pledg himself to wed as hi royal wife on who wa
displeas to him and that therefor he must see her befor he press
hi suit
now that he had seen her in her loveli and glori he announc that
he wa well satisfi which wa but half the truth for in fact she
had set all hi southern blood on fire and there wa noth that he
desir more than to call her wife
on the night which had been appoint for amathel to meet hi destin
bride a feast had been prepar richer by far than ani that went
befor tua feign ignor on enter the great unroof hall lit
with hundr of torch down all it length and see the multitud
at the tabl ask of the pharaoh her father who wa the guest that
he would welcom with such magnific which seem worthi of a god
rather than of a man
my daughter answer the old monarch nervous it is none other
than the princ of kesh who in hi own countri thei worship as divin
as we ar worship here in egypt and who in truth is or will be
on of the greatest of king
kesh she answer i thought that we claim sovereignti over that
land
onc it wa our daughter said her father with a sigh or rather
the king of kesh were also king of egypt but their dynasti fell
befor my greatgreatgrandfath wa call to the throne and now but
three of their blood ar left merm captain of the guard of amen
asti the seer and priestess hi wife your fostermoth and wait
ladi and the young count rame a soldier in our armi who wa your
playmat and as you mai rememb save you from the sacr crocodil
ye i rememb said tua but then why is not merm king of kesh
becaus the peopl of the citi of napata rais up anoth hous to
rule over them of whom amathel is the heir
a usurp heir sure my father if there be anyth in blood
sai not that tua repli pharaoh sharpli for then merm should be
pharaoh in our place also
tua made no repli onli as thei took their seat in the golden chair at
the head of the hall she ask carelessli
is thi princ of kesh also a suitor for my hand o pharaoh
what els should he be my daughter did you not know it be graciou
to him now sinc it is decre that you shall take him as a husband
hush answer not he come
as he spoke a sound of wild music aros and at the far end of the great
hall appear a band of player gorgeous attir who blew horn made
from small tusk of the eleph clash brazen cymbal and beat gild
drum these advanc a littl wai up the hall and stood there plai
while after them march a bodyguard of twenti gigant nubian soldier
who carri broadblad spear with shield of hippopotamu hide
curious work and were cloth in tunic and cap of leopardskin
next appear the princ of kesh himself a short stout
broadshould young man thickfeatur heavyfac and have
larg roll ey he wa clad in festal garment and hung about with
heavi chain of gold fasten with clasp of glitter stone
while from hi crisp black hair rose a tall plume of nod ostrich
feather fan bearer walk besid him and the train of hi long cloak
wa born by two black and hideou dwarf fullgrown men but no taller
than a child of eight
with on swift glanc while he wa yet far awai tua studi the man
from head to foot and hate him as she had never hate anyon befor
then she look over hi head as from her rais seat upon the dai she
wa abl to do and saw that behind him came a second guard of pick
egyptian soldier and that in command of them simpli clad in hi
scale armour of bronz and wear upon hi thigh the goldenhandl
sword that pharaoh had given him wa none other than the young count
rame her playmat and fosterbroth the man whom her heart love at
the sight of hi tall and nobl form and finecut face rise abov the
coars squat figur of the ethiopian princ tua blush rosi red but
pharaoh note it onli thought as other did that it wa becaus now
for the first time her ey fell upon him who would be her husband
why tua wonder wa rame chosen to attend upon the princ amathel
at onc the answer rose in her mind doubtless it had been done to
gratifi the pride of amathel not by pharaoh who would know noth
of such matter but by some bribe councillor or steward of the
household rame wa of more ancient blood than amathel and by right
should be the king of kesh as he should also be pharaoh of egypt
therefor to humbl him he wa set to wait upon amathel
moreov it wa guess that the young queen look kindli upon thi
count rame with whom she had been nurs and who like herself wa
beauti to behold therefor to abas him in her ey he had been
command to appear walk in the train of amathel and given charg
over hi sacr person at the feast
in a moment tua understood it all and made a vow befor her father
amen that soon or late those who had plan thi outrag should pai it
price nor did she forget that promis in the after dai
now the princ had mount the dai and wa bow low to pharaoh and to
her and thei must rise and bow in answer then pharaoh welcom him to
egypt in few wellchosen word give him all hi titl and speak
meaningli of the ancient ti which had link their kingdom ti
which he prai might yet draw them close again
he ceas and look at tua who as queen had also a speech to deliv
that had been given to her in write although she rememb thi well
enough for the roll lai besid her never a word would she read but
turn round and bade on of her waitingladi bring her a fan
so after a paus that seem somewhat long amathel deliv hi answer
that wa learn by rote for it repli to gentl word from the lip
of the divin queen that made hi heart to flower like the desert after
rain not on of which had she spoken thereon tua look over
the top of her fan saw rame smile grimli while unabl to restrain
themselv some of the great personag at the feast broke out
laugh and bow down their head to hide their merriment
with an angri scowl the princ turn and command that the gift
should be brought now slave advanc bear cup of work gold
eleph and other beast fashion in gold and golden vase full of
incens which he present to pharaoh on behalf of hi father the king
of kesh and himself sai boastfulli that in hi countri such thing
were common and that he would have brought more of them had it not been
for their weight
when pharaoh had thank him answer gentli that egypt too wa not
poor as he hope that he would find upon the morrow the princ on
hi own behalf alon offer to the queen other present among
them pector and necklac without price fashion of amethyst and
sapphir also becaus she wa known to be the first of musician and
the sweetestvo ladi in the landfor these were the greatest of the
gift that tua had from amenh gave to her a wonderfulli work harp
of ivori with golden string the frame of the harp be fashion to
the shape of a woman and two black femal slave laden with ornament
who were said to be the best singer in the southern land
now pharaoh whisper to tua to put on on of the necklac but she
would not sai that the colour of the stone did not match her white
robe and the blue lotu flower which she wore instead she thank
amathel coldli but courteous and without look at hi gift told
the royal nurs asti who stood behind her to bear them awai and to
place them at a distanc as the perfum that had been pour over
them oppress her onli as though by an afterthought she bade them
leav the ivori harp
thu inauspici enough the feast began at it amathel drank much of
the sweet wine of asi or cypru command rame who stood behind him
to fill hi cup again and again though whether he did thi becaus he
wa nearest to him or to lower him to the rank of a butler tua did not
know at least have no choic rame obei though cupfil wa
no fit task for a count of egypt and an offic of pharaoh guard
when the wait women clad in net work with spangl of gold
had born awai the meat conjur appear who did wonder feat
amongst other thing caus a like of queen netertua wear her
royal robe and have a star upon her brow to aris out of a vase
then as thei had arrang thei strove to do the same for the princ
amathel but asti who had more magic than all of them watch behind
tua chair put out her strength and threw a spell upon them
behold instead of the form of the princ which these conjur
summon loudli and by name there appear out of the vase a monkei
wear a crown and feather that yet resembl him somewhat which
black and hideou ap stood there for a while seem to gibber at them
then fell down and vanish awai
now some of the audienc laugh and some were silent but pharaoh not
know whether thi were a plot or an evil omen from the god frown
and look anxious at hi guest as it chanc howev the princ
fire with wine wa so engag in stare at the loveli of tua
that he took no note of the thing while the queen look upward and
seem to see noth as for the conjur thei fled from the hall
fear for their live and wonder what strong spirit had enter
into the vase and spoilt the trick which thei had prepar
as thei went singer and danc women hurriedli took their place till
tua weari of the stare of amathel wave her hand and said that she
wish to hear those two nubian slave whose voic were said to be so
wonder so thei were brought forward with their harp and have
prostrat themselv began to plai and sing veri sweetli nubian song
melancholi and wild whereof few could understand the mean so well
did thei sing inde that when thei had done netertua said
you have pleas me much and in payment i give you a royal gift i
give you your freedom and appoint that henceforth you shall sing befor
the court if you think fit to stai here not as slave but for hire
then the two women prostrat themselv again befor her majesti and
bless her for thei knew that thei could earn wealth by their gift
and the rich courtier take the queen cue flung ring and ornament
to them so that in a minut thei got more gold than ever thei had
dream of who were but kidnap slave but princ amathel grew angri
and said
some might have been pleas to keep the priceless gift of the best
singer in the world
do you sai that these sweetvoic women ar the best singer in the
world o princ ask tua speak to him for the first time now
if you will be pleas to listen you provok me to make trial of my own
small skill that i mai learn how far i fall short of the best singer
in the world
then she lift up the ivori harp with the string of gold and swept
her finger over it try it note and adjust them with the agat
screw look at amathel all the while with a challeng in her love
ey
nai nai my daughter said pharaoh it is scarc fit that a
queen of egypt should sing befor all thi nobl compani
why not my father she ask tonight we all do honour to the heir
of hi majesti of kesh pharaoh receiv him pharaoh daughter accept
hi gift the highest in the land surround him then she paus and
ad slowli on of blood more ancient than hi own wait on him as
cupbear on whose race built up the throne hi father fill and
she point to rame who stood near by hold the vase of wine why
then should not egypt queen seek to pleas our royal guest as best
she maysinc she ha no other gift to give him
then in the dead silenc which follow thi bold speech whereof none
could mistak the mean netertua morn star of amen rose from
her seat press the ivori harp against her young breast she
bent over it her head crown with the crown of upper egypt whereon
glisten the royal uru a snake about to strike and swept the
welltun string
such magic wa in her touch that instantli all els wa forgotten even
the pharaoh lean back in hi golden chair to listen softli she struck
at first then by slow degre ever louder till the music of the harp
rang through the pillar hall now at length she lift up her
heavenli voic and began to sing in a strain so wild and sweet that it
seem to pierc to the watch star
it wa a sad and ancient lovetal that she sang which told how a
priestess of hathor of high degre love and wa belov by a simpl
scribe whom she might not wed it told how the scribe madden by hi
passion crept at night into the veri sanctuari of the templ hope to
find her there and for hi sacrileg wa slain by the angri goddess
it told how the beauti priestess come alon to make prayer in the
sanctuari for strength to resist her love stumbl over the lover
corps and know it di of grief it told how hathor goddess
of love melt by the piteou sight breath back life into their
nostril and sinc thei might not remain upon earth waft them to the
underworld where thei awok and embrac and dwell on for ever and for
ay triumphant and rejoic
all had heard thi old old stori but none had ever heard it so
divin sung as tua pure and love voic float over them the
listen seem to see that lover dare all in hi desir creep into
the solemn sanctuari of the templ thei saw hathor appear in her wrath
and smite him cold in death thei saw the beauteou priestess with her
lamp and heard her wail her life awai upon her darl corps saw
too the dead born by spirit over the border of the world
then came that last burst of music thrill and divin and it rich
passion note seem to open the heaven to their sight there in the
deep sky thei perceiv the awaken of the lover and their embrac
of perfect joi and when a glori hid them heard the victori chant of
the priestess of love sigh itself awai faint and ever fainter till
at length it last distant echo di in the utter silenc of the place
of soul
tua ceas her music rest her still quiver harp upon the board
she sank back in her chair of state outworn trembl while in her
pale face the blue ey shone like star there wa still in
the hall the spell of that magic voic lai on the listen none
applaud it seem even that none dare to move for men rememb
that thi wonder young queen wa said to be daughter of amen master
of the world and thought that it had been given to them to hearken not
to a royal maiden but to a goddess of the ski
quiet thei sat as though sleep had smitten them onli everi man of their
number stare at the sweet pale face and at those radiant ey drunk
with passion and with wine amathel princ of kesh lean hi heavi
head upon hi hand and stare like the rest but those ey did not stai
on him had he been a stone thei could not have note him less thei
pass over him seek someth beyond
slowli he turn to see what it might be at which the morn star of
amen gaze and perceiv that the young captain who wait on him he
who wa said to be of a race more ancient and purer than hi own he
whose hous had reign in the southern land when hi ancestor were but
traffick in gold wa also gaze at thi royal singer ye he bent
forward to gaze as though a spell drew him a spell or the ey of
the queen and there wa that upon hi face which even a drunken nubian
could not fail to understand
in the hand of rame wa the tall golden vase of wine and as amathel
thrust back hi chair it topmost ivori bar struck the foot of the
vase and tilt it so that the red wine pour in a torrent over the
princ head and gorgeou robe stain him from hi crest of plume
to hi feet as though with blood up sprang the princ of kesh roar
with furi
dogdescend slave he shout hoghead brother of swine is it
thu that you wait upon my royalti and with the cup in hi hand he
smote rame on the face then drew the sword at hi side to kill him
but rame also wore a sword that sword haft with the golden crocodil
which pharaoh had given him long agothat sword which asti the
foresight had seen red with royal blood with a wild low cry he
snatch it from it sheath and to avoid the blow that amathel struck
at him befor he could guard himself sprang backward from the dai
to the open space in the hall that had been left clear for the dancer
after him leapt amathel call him coward and next instant the
pillar echo not with tua music but with the stern ring of
bronz upon bronz
now in their fear and amaz men look up to pharaoh wait hi word
but pharaoh overcom by the horror of the scene appear to have
swoon at least he lai back in hi chair with hi ey shut like on
asleep then thei look to the queen but tua made no sign onli with
part lip and heav breast watch watch and wait for the end
as for rame he forgot everyth save that he a soldier and a nobl
of royal race had been struck across the mouth by a black nubian who
call himself a princ hi blood boil up in him and through a
red haze as it were he saw tua gloriou ey beckon him on to a
victori he saw and sprang as spring the lion of the desert sprang
straight at the throat of amathel the blow went high an ostrich plume
float to the groundno more and amathel wa a sturdi fighter and had
the strength of mad moreov hi wa the longer weapon it fell
upon the scale of armour of rame and beat him back it fell again
on hi shoulder and struck him to hi knee it fell a third time
and glanc from the mail wound him in the thigh so that the blood
flow now a soldier of pharaoh guard shout to encourag hi
captain and the nubian shout back cry to their princ to slit
the hog throat
then rame seem to awak he leapt from hi knee he smote and the
blow went home though the iron which the nubian wore beneath hi robe
stai it he smote again more fierc and now it wa the blood
of amathel that flow then bend almost to the ground befor the
answer stroke he leapt and thrust with all the strength of young
limb train to war he thrust and behold between the broad shoulder
of amathel pierc from breast to back appear the point of the
egyptian sword for a moment the princ stood still then he fell
backward heavili and lai dead
now with a shout of rage the giant of the nubian guard rush at rame
to aveng their master death so that he must fly backward befor
their spear backward into the rank of the pharaoh guard in a
flash the nubian were on them also and how none could tell a fear
frai began for these soldier hate each other as their father had
done befor them and there were none who could come between them
sinc at thi feast no man bore weapon save the guard fierc wa the
battl but the nubian lack a captain while rame led veteran of
thebe pick for their valour
the giant began to give here and there thei fell till at length but
three of them were left upon their feet who threw down their arm and
cri for merci then it wa for the first time that rame understood
what he had done with bent head hi red sword in hi hand he climb
the dai and knelt befor the throne of pharaoh sai
i have aveng my honour and the honour of egypt slai me o pharaoh
but pharaoh made no answer for hi swoon still held him
then rame turn to tua and said
pharaoh sleep but in your hand is the sceptr slai me o queen
now tua who all thi while had watch like on frozen into stone
seem to thaw to life again her danger wa past she could never be
forc to wed that coars blacksoul nubian for rame had kill
him yonder he lai dead in all hi fineri with hi hideou giant about
him like fallen tree and oh in her rebelli human heart she bless
rame for the deed
but as she who wa train in statecraft knew well enough if he had
escap the sword of princ amathel it wa but to fall into a peril
from which there seem to be no escap thi dead princ wa the heir
of a great king of a king so great that for a centuri egypt had dare
to make no war upon hi countri for it wa far awai wellfortifi and
hard to come at across desert and through savag tribe moreov the
man had been slain at a feast in pharaoh court and by an offic of
pharaoh guard which afterward had kill hi escort under the ey
of egypt monarch the hand of on of whom he sought in marriag such
a deed must mean a bitter war for egypt and to those who struck the
blowdeath as rame himself knew well
tua look at him kneel befor her and her heart ach fierc
despairingli she thought throw her soul afar to seek out wisdom and
a wai of escap for rame present in the black of her mind there
aros a plan and as ever wa her fashion she act swiftli lift
her head she command that the door should be lock and guard so
that none might go in or out and that those physician who were amongst
the compani should attend to the wound and to pharaoh who wa
ill then she call the high council of the kingdom all of whom were
gather there about her and spoke in a cold calm voic while the
compani flock round to listen
lord and peopl she said the god for their own purpos have
suffer a fear thing to come to pass egypt guest and hi guard
have been slain befor egypt king ye at their feast and in their
veri presenc and it will be said far and wide that thi ha been done
by treacheri yet you know well as i do that it wa no treacheri
but a mischanc the divin princ who is dead as all of you saw
grew drunken after the fashion of hi peopl and in hi drunken he
struck a highborn man a count of egypt and an offic of pharaoh who
to do him greater honour wa set to wait upon him call him by vile
name and drew hi sword upon him to kill him am i right did you see
and hear these thing
ay answer the council and the audienc
then went on tua thi offic forget all save hi outrag
honour dare to fight for hi life even against the princ of kesh and
be the better man slew him afterward the servant of the princ of
kesh attack him and pharaoh guard and were conquer and the most
of them kill sinc none here had arm wherewith to part them have i
spoken truth
yea o queen thei answer again by their spokesman rame and the
royal guard have littl blame in the matter and from the rest of them
rose a murmur of assent
now went on tua with gather confid for she felt that all saw
with her ey to add to our woe pharaoh my father ha been smitten
by the god he sleep he cannot speak i know not whether he will live
or die and therefor it would seem that i the dulycrown queen of
egypt must act for him as wa provid in such a case sinc the matter
is veri urgent and mai not be delai is it your will she ad
address the council that i should so act as the god mai show me
how to do
it is right and fit answer the vizier the king companion on
behalf of all of them
then priest lord and peopl continu the queen what cours
shall we take in thi sore strait speak with the voic of all of
you and on your behalf i can command that the count rame and all those
other chosen men whom pharaoh love who fought with him shall be slain
forthwith thi inde she ad slowli i should wish to do sinc
although rame had suffer intoler insult such as no highborn man
can be ask to bear even from a princ and he and all of them were
but fight to save their live and to show the nubian that we ar not
coward here in egypt without doubt thei have conquer and slain the
heir of kesh and hi black giant who were our guest and for thi deed
their live ar forfeit
she paus watch while although here and there a voic answer
ye or thei must die from the rest aros a murmur of dissent for
in their heart the compani were on the side of rame and pharaoh
guard moreov thei were proud of the young captain skill and
courag and glad that the nubian whom thei hate with an ancient
hate had been defeat by the lesser men of egypt some of whom were
their friend or rel
now while thei argu among themselv tua rose from her chair and
went to look at pharaoh whom the physician were attend chafe hi
hand and pour water on hi brow present she return with tear
stand in her beauti ey for she love her father and said in a
heavi voic
ala pharaoh is veri ill set the evil ha smitten him and it is
hard my peopl that he perchanc mai be taken from us and we must
bear such woe becaus of the ill behaviour of a royal foreign for i
cannot forget that it wa he who caus thi tumult
the audienc agre that it wa veri hard and look angrili at the
surviv nubian but tua conquer herself continu
we must bear the blow that the fate rain on us nor suffer our
privat grief to dull the sword of justic now as i have said even
though we love them as our brother or our husband yet the count rame
and hi brave comrad should perish by a death of shame such a death
as littl befit the flower of pharaoh guard
again she paus then went on in the midst of an intens silenc for
even the physician ceas from their work to hearken to her decre as
suprem judg of egypt
and yet and yet my peopl even as i wa about to pass sentenc upon
them utter the doom that mai not be recal some guardian spirit
of our land sent a thought into my heart on which i think it right
to take your judgment if we destroi these men as i desir to destroi
them will thei not sai in the southern countri and in all the nation
around that first thei had been told to murder the princ of kesh and
hi escort and then were themselv execut to cover up our crime
will it not be believ that there is blood upon the hand of pharaoh
and of egypt the blood of a royal guest who it is well known wa
welcom here with love and joi that he mightoh forgiv me i am but
a maiden i cannot sai it nai piti me not and answer not till i have
set out all the case as best i mai which i fear me is but ill it is
certain that thi will be saiday and believ and we of egypt all
call traitor and that these men who after all howev evil ha
been their deed ar brave and upright will be written in all the book
of all the land as common murder and go down to osiri with that
ill name brand on their brow ye and their shame will cling to the
pure hand of pharaoh and hi councillor
now at thi pictur the peopl murmur and some of the nobl women
there began to weep outright
but proceed tua with her plead voic how if we were to take
anoth cours how if we command thi count rame and hi companion
to journei with an escort such as befit the majesti of pharaoh to the
far citi of napata and there to lai befor the great king of that land
by write and the mouth of wit all the sad stori of the death
of hi onli son how if we sent letter to thi majesti of kesh sai
thou hast heard our tale thou knowest all our woe now judg if thou
art nobleheart and it pleas thee to acquit these men acquit them
and we will prais thee but if thou art wroth and stern and it pleas
thee to condemn these men condemn them and send them back to us for
punish that punish which thou dost decre is that plan good
my peopl can hi majesti of kesh complain if he is made judg in hi
own caus can the king and captain of other land then declar that
in egypt we work murder on our guest tell me who have so littl
wisdom if thi plan is good as i dare to sai to you it seem to me
now with on voic the council and all the guest and especi the
guard themselv who were on their trial save rame who still knelt
in silenc befor the queen cri out that it wa veri good ye thei
clap their hand and shout vow to each other that thi young
queen of their wa the spirit of wisdom come to earth and that her
excel person wa fill with the soul of a god
but she frown at their prais and hold up her sceptr sternli
command silenc

so spoke tua and the royal decre have been written down swiftli and
read aloud she seal and sign with her signmanu as queen that it
might not be chang or alter and command that copi of it should
be sent to all the governor of the nome of egypt and a duplic
prepar and despatch with thi royal embassi for so she name it to

then at length the door were thrown open and the compani dispers
rame and the guard be led awai by the council and place in safe
keep also pharaoh still senseless but breath quietli wa
carri to hi bed and the dead were taken to the embalm whilst
tua so weari that she could scarc walk depart to her chamber
lean on the shoulder of the royal nurs asti the mother of rame
chapter vi
the oath of rame and of tua
still robe tua lai upon a couch for she would not seek her bed while
asti stood near to her a dark command figur
your majesti ha done strang thing tonight said asti in her quiet
voic
tua turn her head and look at her then answer
veri strang nurs you see the god and that troublesom son of
your and pharaoh sudden sick threw the string of fate into
my hand andi pull them i alwai had a fanci for the pull of
string but the chanc never came my wai befor
it seem to me that for a beginn your majesti pull somewhat hard
said asti drili
ye nurs so hard that i think i have pull your son off the
scaffold into a place of some honour if he know how to stai there
though it wa the council and the lord and the ladi who thought that
thei pull you see on must commenc as on mean to go on
your majesti is veri clever you will make a great queenif you do not
overpul yourself
not half so clever as you were asti when you made that monkei come
out of the vase answer tua laugh somewhat hyster oh do
not look innoc i know it wa your magic for i could feel it pass
over my head how did you do it asti
if your majesti will tell me how you made the lord of egypt consent to
the send of an arm expedit to napata under the command of a lad
a mere captain who had just kill it heirappar befor their ey
which decre if i know anyth of rame will mean a war between kesh
and egypt i will tell you how i made the monkei come out of the vase
then i shall never learn nurs for i cant becaus i dont know it
came into my mind as music come into my throat that is all rame
should have been behead at onc shouldnt he for not let that
black boar tusk him do you think he pour the wine over amathel head
on purpos and again she laugh
ye i suppos that he should have been kill as he would have been
if your majesti had not chanc to be so fond
talk of wine broke in tua give me a cup of it the divin princ
of kesh who wa to have been my husbanddid you understand asti that
thei realli meant to make that black barbarian my husbandi sai that
the divin princ who now sup with osiri drank so much that i could
not touch a drop and i am tire and thirsti and have still some thing
to do tonight
asti went to a tabl where stood a flagon of wine wreath in vine
leav and by it cup of glass and fill on of them brought it to
tua
here to the memori of the divin princ and mai he have left the
tabl of osiri befor i come there and here to the hand that sent

of it and threw the cup to the marbl floor where it shatter into
bit
what god ha enter into your majesti tonight ask asti quietli
on that know hi own mind i think repli tua there i feel
strong again i go to visit pharaoh come with me asti
when tua arriv at the bedsid of pharaoh she found that the worst of
the danger wa over fear for hi life the physician had bled him
and now the fit had pass awai and hi ey were open although he wa
unabl to speak and did not know her or anyon she ask whether he
would live or die and wa told that he would live or so hi doctor
believ but that for a long while he must lie quit quiet see as
few peopl as possibl and abov all be troubl with no busi
sinc if he were weari or excit the fit would certainli return
and kill him so rejoic at thi new which wa better than she had
expect tua kiss her father and left him
now will your majesti go to bed ask asti when she had return to
her own apart
by no mean answer tua i wear pharaoh shoe and have much
busi left to do tonight summon merm your husband
so merm came and stood befor her he wa still what he had been
in the old dai when tua plai as an infant in hi hous stern
noblelook and of few word but now hi hair had grown white and hi
face wa drawn with grief both for the sake of rame whose hot blood
had brought him into so much danger and becaus pharaoh who wa hi
friend lai between life and death
tua look at him and love him more than ever for now that he wa
troubl some new like to rame appear upon hi face which she had
never seen befor
take heart nobl merm she said gentli thei sai that pharaoh
stai with us yet a while
i thank amen he answer for had he di hi blood would have been
upon the hand of my hous
not so merm it would have been upon the hand of the god you
spring from a royal line sai what would you have thought of your son
if after be struck by that fat nubian he had cower at hi feet and
prai for hi life like ani slave
merm flush and smile a littl then said
the question is ratherwhat would you have thought o queen
i answer tua well as a queen i should have prais him much
sinc then egypt would have been spare great troubl but as a woman
and a friend i should never have spoken to him again honour is more
than life merm
certainli honour is more than life repli merm stare at the
ceil perhap to hide the look upon hi face and for a littl while
rame seem to be in the wai of it but those who ar set high have far
to fall o queen andforg mehe is my onli child now when pharaoh
recov
rame will be far awai broke in tua go bring him here at onc and
with him the vizier and the chief scribe of the council take thi ring
it will open all door and she drew the signet from her finger and
hand it to him
at thi hour your majesti said merm in a doubt voic
have i not spoken she answer impati when the welfar of
egypt is at stake i do not sleep
so merm bow and went and while he wa gone tua caus asti to
smooth her hair and chang her robe and ornament for other which
although she did not sai so she thought becam her better then she
sat her down in a chair of state in her chamber of audienc and wait
while asti stood besid her ask no question but wonder
at length the door were open and through them appear merm and
the vizier and the chief of the scribe both of them try to hide
their yawn for thei had been summon from their bed who were not
wont to do state busi at such hour after them limp rame for
hi wound had grown stiff who look bewild but otherwis just as
he had left the feast
now without wait for the greet of ceremoni tua began to
question the vizier as to what step had been taken in further of
her decre and when he assur her that the busi wa on foot went
into it everi detail with him as to the ship and the offic and the
provis of the men and so forth next she set herself to dictat
despatch to the captain and baron who held the fortress on the
upper nile commun to them pharaoh order on thi matter and
the commiss of rame wherebi he whose hand had done the ill wa
put in command of the great embassi that went to make amend
these be finish she sent awai the scribe to spend the rest of the
night in write them in duplic bid him bring them to her in the
earli morn to be seal next address rame she command him to
start on the morrow with those troop which were readi to takensit
abov the first cataract of the nile which wa the frontier fortress of
egypt and there wait until the remaind of the soldier join them
bear with them her present to the king of kesh and the embalm
bodi of the princ amathel
rame bow and said that her order should be obei and the audienc
be finish still bow and support by merm began to walk
backward toward the door hi ey fix upon the face of tua who sat
with bent head clasp the arm of her chair like on in difficulti
and doubt when he had gone a few step she seem to come to some
determin for with an effort she rais herself and said
return count rame i have a messag to give you for the king of kesh
who unhappi man ha lost hi son and heir and it is on that no other
ear must hear leav me a while with thi captain o merm and asti
and see that none listen to our talk present i will summon you to
conduct him awai
thei hesit for thi thing seem strang then note the look she
gave them depart through the door behind the royal seat
now rame and the queen were left alon in that great light chamber
with bent head and fold arm he stood befor her while she look at
him intent yet seem to find no word to sai at length she spoke in
a sweet low voic
it is mani year sinc we were playmat in the court of the templ
yonder and sinc then we have never been alon togeth have we

i am but a humbl soldier who cannot hope to consort with queen

then smile in her quiet fashion hi mother drew from the bosom
of her robe some object that wa wrap in linen and touch her
forehead with the royal seal that fasten it gave it to rame with
trembl finger he broke the seal and there within the linen lai a
ring which for some year as rame knew tua had worn upon the first
finger of her right hand it wa massiv and of plain gold and upon the
bezel of it wa cut the symbol of the sun on either side of which knelt
a man and a woman crown with the doubl crown of egypt and hold
in their right hand the loop sign of life which thei stretch up
toward the glori of the sun
do you know who wore that ring in long past dai ask asti of rame
who press it to hi lip
he shook hi head who rememb onli that tua had worn it
it wa your forefath and mine rame the last of the royal ruler of
our line who reign over egypt and also over the land of kesh a
while ago the embalm recloth hi divin bodi in the tomb and the
princess who wa present there with your father and myself drew thi
ring off hi dead hand and offer it to merm who would not take it

her own reason she send it to you perhap to give you author in
kesh where that mighti seal is known
i thank the queen he murmur i shall wear it alwai
then let it be on your breast till you have pass the frontier lest

went on quickli you dare to love thi queen of our
in truth i do mother did not you who know everyth know that
also it is your fault who brought us up togeth
nai my son the fault of the god who have so decre butdo she

you ar alwai with her mother ask her yourself if you need to ask
at least she ha sent me her own ring oh mother mother guard her
night and dai for if harm come to her then i die mother queen
cannot give themselv where thei will as other women can it is polici
that thrust their husband on them keep her unw mother though it
should cost her her throne still i sai let her not be cast into the
arm of on she hate protect her in her trial if such should come
and if strength fail and the god desert her then hide her in the web
of the magic that you have and preserv her undefil for so shall i
bless your name for ever
you fly at a rare bird rame and there ar mani stronger hawk about
besid that on you slew ye royal eagl who mai strike down the
pair of you yet i will do my best who have long foreseen thi hour

ring upon your heart and your secret in it as i shall lest you should
return no more to egypt moreov follow your royal star and no other
whatev counsel she mai have given you follow it also stir not to
right or left for i sai that in that maiden breast of her there dwell
the wisdom of the god
then hold up her hand over hi head as though in bless asti
too turn and left him
so rame went and wa no more seen and by degre the talk as to the
matter of hi victori over the princ of kesh and as to hi appoint
by the whim of the maiden queen to command the splendid embassi of
aton which she had despatch to the old king the dead man
father di awai for lack of anyth to feed on
tua kept her counsel well nor wa aught known of that midnight
interview with the young count her gener moreov napata wa far
awai so far that start at the season when it did the embassi could
scarc return till two year had gone by if ever it did return also
few believ that whoever came back rame would be on of them sinc
it wa said openli that so soon as he wa beyond the frontier of
egypt the soldier had order to kill him and take on hi bodi as a
peaceoff
inde all prais the wit and wisdom of the queen who by thi polit
devic had rid herself of a troublesom busi with as littl scandal
as possibl and avoid stain her own hand in the blood of a
fosterbroth had she order hi death forthwith thei said it would
have been suppos also that she had put him awai becaus he wa of a
royal race on who in the futur might prove a rival or at least
caus some rebellion
meanwhil greater question fill the mouth of men would pharaoh die
and leav netertua the young and love to hold hi throne and if
so what would happen it wa a thousand year sinc a woman had reign
in egypt and none had reign who were not wed therefor it seem
necessari that a husband should be found for her as soon as might be
but pharaoh did not die on the contrari though veri slowli he
recov and wa stronger than he had been for year for the fit that
struck him down seem to have clear hi blood for some three month
he lai helpless as a child amus himself as a child doe with littl
thing and talk of children whom he had known in hi youth or when
some of these chanc to visit him as old men ask them to plai with
him with top or ball
then on dai came a chang and rise from hi bed he command the
presenc of hi councillor and when thei came inquir of them what
had happen and why he could rememb noth sinc the feast
thei put him off with soft word and soon he grew weari and dismiss
them but after thei had gone and he had eaten he sent for merm the
captain of the guard of amen and hi friend and question him
the last thing i rememb he said wa see the drunken princ of
kesh fight with your son that handsom fieryei count rame whom
some fool or enemi had set to wait upon him at tabl it wa a dog
trick merm for after all your blood is purer and more ancient than
that of the present king of kesh well the horror of the sight of my
royal guest the suitor for my daughter hand fight with an offic
of my own guard at my own board struck me as a butcher strike an ox
and after it all wa black what chanc merm
thi pharaoh my son kill amathel in fair fight then those black
nubian giant in their furi attack your guard but led by rame the
egyptian though thei were the lesser men overcam them and slew most
of them i am an old soldier but never have i seen a finer frai
a finer frai a finer frai gasp pharaoh why thi will mean a
war between kesh and egypt and then did the council order rame to be
execut as you must admit he deserv although you ar hi father
not so o pharaoh moreov i admit noth though had he plai a
coward part befor all the lord of egypt gladli would i have slain
him with my own hand
ah said pharaoh there speak the soldier and the parent well i
understand he wa affront wa he not by that bedizen black man
were i in your place i should sai as much butwhat happen
your majesti have becom unconsci explain merm her majesti
the queen netertua gloriou in ra took command of affair accord
to her oath of crown she ha sent an embassi of aton of two
thousand pick soldier to the king of kesh bear with them the
embalm bodi of the divin amathel and mani royal gift
that is good enough in it wai said pharaoh but why two thousand
men whereof the cost will be veri great when a score would have
suffic it is an armi not an embassi and when my royal brother of
kesh see it advanc bear with it the illomen gift of hi onli
son bodi he mai take alarm
merm respectfulli agre that he might do so
what gener is in command of thi embassi as it pleas you to call
it
the count rame my son is in command your majesti
now weak as he wa still pharaoh nearli leapt from hi chair
rame that young cutthroat who kill the princ rame who is the
last of the old right dynasti of kesh rame a mere captain in
command of two thousand of my veteran oh i must still be mad who
gave him the command
the queen netertua star of amen she gave him the command o pharaoh
immedi after the frai in the hall she utter her decre and caus
it to be record in the usual fashion
send for the queen said pharaoh with a groan
so tua wa summon and present swept in glorious arrai and on
see her father sit up and well ran to him and embrac him and
for a long time refus to listen to hi talk of matter of state at
length howev he made her sit by him still hold hi hand and
ask her why in the name of amen she had sent that handsom young
firebrand rame in command of the expedit to kesh then she
answer veri sweetli that she would tell him and tell him she did at
such length that befor she had finish pharaoh whose strength as yet
wa small had fallen into a doze
now you understand she said as he woke up with a start the
respons wa thrust upon me and i had to act as i thought best
to have slain thi young rame would have been imposs for all
heart were with him
but sure daughter you might have got him out of the wai
my father that is what i have done i have sent him to napata which
is veri much out of the waymani month journei i am told
but what will happen tua either the king of kesh will kill him and
my two thousand soldier or perhap he will kill the king of kesh as he
kill hi son and seiz the throne which hi own forefath held for
gener have you thought of that
ye my father i thought of it and if thi last should happen through
no fault of our would egypt weep think you
now pharaoh stare at tua and tua look back at pharaoh and smile
i perceiv daughter he said slowli that in you ar the make of
a great queen for within the silken scabbard of a woman folli i see
the statesman sword of bronz onli run not too fast lest you should
fall upon that sword and it should pierc you
now tua who had heard such word befor from asti smile again but
made no answer
you need a husband to hold you back went on pharaoh some great man
whom you can love and respect
find me such a man my father and i will wed him gladli answer tua
in a sweet voic onli she ad i know not where he mai be sought
now that the divin amathel is dead at the hand of the count rame our
gener and ambassador to kesh
so when he grew stronger pharaoh renew hi search for a husband meet
to marri the queen of egypt now as befor suitor were not lack
inde hi ambassador and councillor sent in their name by two and
three but alwai when thei were submit to her tua found someth
against everyon of them till at last it wa said that she must be
destin for a god sinc no mere mortal would serv her turn but when
thi wa report to her tua onli answer with a smile that she wa
destin to that royal lover of whom amen had spoken to her mother in a
dream not to a god but to the chosen of the god and that when she saw
him she felt sure she would know him at onc and love him much
after some month had gone by pharaoh quit weari of thi plai ask
the advic of hi council thei suggest to him that he should journei
through the great citi of egypt both becaus the chang might
complet reestablish hi divin health and in the hope that on her
travel the queen netertua would meet someon of royal blood with whom
she could fall in love for by now it wa evid to all of them that
unless she did fall in love she would not marri
so that veri night pharaoh ask hi daughter if she would undertak
such a journei
she answer that noth would pleas her better as she weari of
thebe and desir to see the other great citi of the land to make
herself known to those who dwell in them and in each to be proclaim
as it futur ruler also she wish to look upon the ocean whereof she
had heard that it wa so big that all the water of the nile flow
into it dai and night made no differ to it volum
thu then began that pilgrimag which afterward tua record in the
histori of her reign on the wall of the wonder templ that she
built her own wish wa that thei should sail south to the frontier of
egypt sinc there she hope that she might hear some tide of rame
and hi expedit whereof latterli no certain word had come thi
project howev wa overrul becaus in the south there were
no great town also the inhabit of the border desert were
turbul and might choos that moment to attack
so in the end thei went down and not up the nile tarri for a while
at everi great citi and especi at atbu the holi place where the
head of osiri is buri and ten of thousand of the great men of
egypt have their tomb here tua wa crown afresh in the veri shrine
of osiri amidst the rejoic of the peopl
then thei sail awai to on the citi of the sun and thenc to make
offer at the great pyramid which were built by some of the earli
king who had rule egypt to serv them as their tomb
netertua enter the pyramid to look upon the bodi of these pharaoh
who had been dead for thousand of year and whose deed were all
forgotten though her father would not accompani her there becaus the
wai were so steep that he did not dare to tread them afterward with
asti and a small guard of the arab chief of the desert she mount a
dromedari and rode round them in the moonlight hope that she would
meet the ghost of those king and that thei would talk with her as the
ghost of her mother had done but she saw no ghost nor would asti try
to summon them from their sleep although tua prai her to do so
leav them alon said asti as thei paus in the shadow of the
greatest of the pyramid and stare at it shine face engrav from
base to summit with mani a mystic write
leav them alon lest thei should be angri as amen wa and tell your
majesti thing which you do not wish to hear contempl their mighti
work such as no monarch can build todai and suffer them to rest
therein undisturb by weaker folk
do you call these mighti work ask tua contemptu for she wa
angri becaus asti would not try to rais the dead what ar thei after
all but so mani stone put togeth by the labour of men to satisfi
their own vaniti and of those who built them what stori remain there
is none at all save some vain legend now if i live i will rear a
greater monument for histori shall tell of me till time be dead
perhap netertua if you live and the god will it though for
my part i think that these old stone will surviv the stori of most
deed
on the morrow of thi visit to the pyramid pharaoh and the queen hi
daughter made their state entri into the great whitewal citi of
memphi where thei were royal receiv by pharaoh brother the
princ abi who wa still the ruler of all thi town and district as
it chanc these two had not met sinc abi mani year befor came to
thebe ask a share in the govern of egypt and to be nomin as
successor to the throne
like everi other lord and princ he had been invit to be present at
the great ceremoni of the crown of netertua but at the last moment
sent hi excus sai that he wa ill which seem to be true at
ani rate the spi report that he wa confin to hi bed though
whether sick or hi own will took him thither at thi moment there
wa noth to show at the time pharaoh and hi council wonder a
littl that he had made no propos for the marriag of on of hi son
of whom he had four to their royal cousin netertua but decid that
he had not done so becaus he wa sure that it would not be accept
for the rest dure all thi period abi had kept quiet in hi own
govern which he rule well and strongli remit hi tax to
thebe at the proper time with a ceremoni letter of homag and even
increas the amount of them
so it came about that pharaoh who by natur wa kindli and
unsuspici had long ago put awai all mistrust of hi brother whose
ambit he wa sure had come to an end with the birth of an heiress
to the throne
yet when escort onli by five hundr of hi guard for thi wa
a peac visit pharaoh rode into the mighti citi and saw how
impregn were it wall and how strong it gate saw also that the
street were line with thousand of wellarm troop doubt which he
dismiss as unworthi did creep into hi heart but if he said noth
of them tua who rode in the chariot with him wa not so silent
my father she said in a low voic while the crowd shout their
welcom for thei were alon in the chariot the hors of which were
led thi uncl of mine keep a great state in memphi
ye daughter why should he not he is it governor
a stranger who did not know the truth might think he wa it king
my father and to be plain if i were pharaoh and had chosen to enter
here it would have been with a larger forc
we can go awai when we like tua said pharaoh uneasili
you mean my father that we can go awai when it pleas the princ
your brother to open those great bronz gate that i heard clash behind
usthen and not befor
at thi moment their talk came to an end for the chariot wa stai
at the step of the great hall where abi wait to receiv hi royal
guest he stood at the head of the step a huge coars vigor man
of about sixti year of ag on whose fat swarthi face there wa
still oddli enough some resembl to the delic refinedfeatur
pharaoh
tua sum him up in a singl glanc and instantli hate him even more
than she had hate amathel princ of kesh also she who had not fear
the emptyhead drunken amathel wa penetr with a strang terror
of thi man whom she felt to be strong and intellig and whose
great greedi ey rest on her beauti as though thei could not tear
themselv awai
now thei were ascend the step and now princ abi wa welcom them
to hi humbl hous give them their throne name and sai
how rejoic he wa to see them hi sovereign within the wall of
memphi while all the time he stare at tua
pharaoh who wa tire made no repli but the young queen stare back
at him answer
we thank you for your greet but then my uncl abi why did you
not meet us outsid the gate of memphi where we expect to find
it governor wait to deliv up the kei of pharaoh citi to the
offic of pharaoh
now abi who had thought to see some shrink child cloth in the
emblem of a queen look astonish at thi tall and royal maiden who
had so sharp a tongu and found no word to answer her so she swept
past him and command to be shown where she should lodg in memphi
thei led her to it greatest palac that had been prepar for pharaoh
and herself a place surround by palm grove in the midst of the citi
but have studi it with her quick ey she said that it did not
pleas her so search wa made elsewher and in the end she chose
anoth smaller palac that onc had been a templ of sekhet the
tigerhead goddess of vengeanc and of chastiti whereof the pylon
tower front on the nile which at it flood wash against them
inde thei were now part of the wall of memphi for the great unus
gatewai between them had been built up with huge block of stone
surround thi palac and outsid it court lai the old garden of
the templ where the priest of sekhet us to wander enclos within a
lofti limeston wall here sai that the air from the river would be
more healthi for him tua persuad pharaoh to establish himself and hi
court and to encamp the guard under the command of hi friend merm
in the outer colonnad and garden
when it wa point out to the queen that ow to the lack of
dwellingroom none which were fit were left for her to occupi she
repli that thi matter noth sinc in the old pylon tower were
two small chamber hollow in the thick of it wall which were
veri pleas to her becaus of the prospect of the nile and the wide
flat land and the distant pyramid command from the lofti roof
and windowplac so these chamber in which none had dwelt for
gener were hastili clean out and furnish and in them tua and
asti her fostermoth took up their abod
chapter viii
the magic imag
that night pharaoh and tua rest in privaci with those member of the
court whom thei had brought with them but on the morrow began a round
of festiv such as histori scarc told of in egypt inde the
feast with which it open wa more splendid than ani tua had seen at
thebe even at the time of her crown or on that dai of blood and
happi when amathel and hi nubian guard were slain and she and
rame declar their love at thi feast pharaoh and the young queen sat
in chair of gold while the princ abi wa place on her right hand
and not on that of pharaoh as he should have been as host and subject
i am too much honour said tua look at him sidewai why do you
not sit by pharaoh my uncl
who am i that i should take the seat of honour when my sovereign come
to visit me answer abi bow hi great head let it be reserv
for the highpriest of osiri that holi on whom after ptah we
worship here abov all other deiti for he is cloth with the majesti
of the god of death
of death said tua is that why you put him by my father
inde not repli abi spread out hi hand though if a choic
must be made i would rather that he sat near on who is old and must
soon be call the everliv than at the side of the loveliest
queen that egypt ha ever seen to whom it is said that amen himself ha
sworn a long life and again he bow
you mean that you think pharaoh will soon die nai deni it not
princ abi i can read your thought and thei ar illomen said tua
sharpli and turn her head awai began to watch those about her
soon she notic that behind abi amongst hi other offic stood a
tall grizzl man clad in the robe and cap of an astrolog who
appear to be studi everyth and especi pharaoh and herself
for whenev she look round it wa to find hi quick black ey fix
upon her
who is that man she whisper present to asti who wait on her
the famou astrolog kaku queen i have seen him befor when he
visit thebe with the princ befor your birth i will tell you of him
afterward watch him well
so tua watch and discov sever thing among them that kaku
observ everyth that she and pharaoh did what thei at to whom
thei spoke and ani word which fell from their lip such as those that
she had utter about the god osiri all of these he note down from
time to time on hi waxen tablet doubtless that he might make us of
them afterward in hi interpret of the omen of the futur
now among the ladi of the court who fan pharaoh and wait on him
wa that danc girl of abi who mani year befor had betrai him at
thebe merytra ladi of the footstool now a woman of middl ag but
still beauti of whom although tua dislik her pharaoh wa fond
becaus she wa clever and witti of speech and amus him for thi
reason in spite of her histori he had advanc her to wealth and
honour and kept her about hi person as a companion of hi lighter
hour someth in thi woman manner attract tua attent for
continu she look at the astrolog kaku who suddenli awok to
her presenc and smile as though he recognis an old friend then
when it wa the turn of anoth to take her place behind pharaoh
merytra drew alongsid of kaku and under shelter of her broad fan
spoke to him quickli as though she were make some arrang with
him and he nod in assent after which thei separ again
the feast wore on it weari cours till at length the door open and
slave appear bear the mummi of a dead man which thei set upon it
feet in the centr of the hall whereon a toastmast cri
drink and be merri all ye great on of the earth who know not how
soon ye shall come to thi last lowli state
now thi bring in of the mummi wa a veri ancient rite but on that
had fallen into gener disus so that as it chanc tua who had never
seen it practis befor look on it with curios not unmingl with
disgust
why is a dead king drag from hi sepulchr back into the world of
life my uncl she ask point to the royal emblem with which the
corps wa cloth
it is no king your majesti answer abi but onli the bone of some
humbl person or perhap a block of wood that wear the uru and
carri the sceptr in honour of pharaoh our chief guest
now tua frown and pharaoh who had overheard the talk said smile
sadli
a somewhat poor compliment my brother to on who like myself is
old and sickli and not far from hi etern habit yet why should i
grumbl at it who need no such remind of that which await me and all
of us and he lean back in hi chair and sigh while tua look at
him anxious
then abi order the mummi to be remov declar with mani
apolog that it had been brought there onli becaus such wa the
ancient custom of memphi which unlik thebe did not chang it
fashion he ad that thi same bodi or figur for he knew not which
it wa have never troubl to inquir had been look upon by at
least thirti pharaoh all as dead as it todai sinc it wa the
same that wa us at the royal feast befor long ago the seat of
govern wa move to thebe
if so broke in tua who wa angri it is time that it should be
buri if flesh and bone or burn if wood but pharaoh is weari
have we your leav to depart my uncl
without answer abi rose as she thought to dismiss the compani but
it wa not so for he rais a great golden cup of wine and said
befor we part my guest let memphi drink a welcom to the mighti
lord of the two land who for the first time in hi long and gloriou
reign honour it with hi presenc here todai as he said to me but
now my royal brother is weak and ag with sick nor can we hope
that onc hi visit is end he will return again to the whitewal
citi but as it chanc the god have given him a boon which thei deni
for long the love daughter who share hi throne and who as we
believ and prai will reign after him when it pleas him to ascend
into the kingdom of osiri yet my friend it is evil that the safe
and law govern of egypt should hang on on frail life therefor
thi is the toast to which i drinkthat the queen netertua morn
star of amen hathor strong in beauti who ha reject so mani suitor
mai befor she depart from among us find on to her like some
husband of royal blood skill in the art of rule whose strength and
knowledg mai serv to support her woman weak and inexperi in
that sad hour when she find herself alon
now the audienc who well understood the inner mean and object of
thi speech rose and cheer furious as thei had been school to
do empti their cup to pharaoh and to tua and shout
we know the man take him gloriou queen take him daughter of amen
and reign for ever
what do thei mean mutter pharaoh i do not understand thank them
my daughter my voic is weak and let us begon
so tua rose when at length there wa silenc and look round her
with flash ey said in her clear voic that reach the furthest
recess of the hall
the pharaoh my father and i the queen of the upper and the lower
land return thank to you our peopl of thi citi for your loyal
greet but as for the word that the princ abi ha spoken we
understand them not my prayer is that the pharaoh mai still reign in
glori for mani year but if he depart and i remain learn o peopl
that you have naught to fear from the weak and inexperi of your
queen learn also that she seek no husband nor when she seek will she
ever find on within the wall of memphi rest you well o peopl and
you my uncl abi as now with your good leav we will do also
then turn she took her father by the hand and went without more
word leav abi stare at hi guest while hi guest stare back at
him
when tua had reach the pylon tower where she lodg and her ladi
had unrob her and gone she call asti to her from the adjoin
chamber and said
you ar wise my nurs tell me what did abi mean
if your majesti cannot guess then you ar duller than i thought
answer asti in her quick dry fashion ad howev i will try to
translat the princ abi your nobl uncl mean that he ha trap
you here and that you shall not leav these wall save as hi wife
now furi took hold of tua
how dare he speak such word she gasp spring to her feet i
the wife of that old riverhog my father brother who might be my
grandfath that hideou ancient lump of wicked who boast that he
ha a hundr son and daughter i the queen of egypt whose birth wa
decre by amen ihow dare you and she ceas choke in her wrath
the question ishow he dare queen still that is hi plot which
he will carri through if he is abl i suspect it from the first
and that is why i alwai oppos thi visit to memphi but you will
rememb that you bade me be silent sai that you had determin to
see the most ancient citi in egypt
you should not have been silent you should have said what wa in your
mind even if i order you from my presenc neither abi nor ani of hi
son propos for my hand when the other did therefor i suspect
noth
after the fashion of women who have alreadi given their heart queen
and forget that thei have other thing to givea kingdom for instanc
the snake doe not roar like the lion yet it is more to be fear
onc i am out of thi place it is the snake that shall have caus
to fear asti for i will break it back and throw it writh to the
kite nurs we must leav memphi
that is not easi queen sinc some ceremoni is plan for each of the
next eight dai if pharaoh were to go awai without attend them he
would anger all the peopl of the north which he ha not visit sinc
he wa crown
then let them be anger pharaoh can do as he will
ye queen at least that is the sai but do you think that pharaoh
wish to bring about a civil war and risk hi crown and your listen
abi is veri strong and under hi command he ha a greater armi than
pharaoh can muster in these time of peac for in addit to hi
train troop all the thousand of the bedouin tribe of the desert
look on him as lord and at hi word will fall on the wealth of egypt
like famish vultur on a fat ox moreov here you have but a
guard of five hundr men wherea abi regiment summon to do you
honour and hi ship of war block the river and the southern road how
then will you leav memphi without hi good leav how will you even
send messeng to summon aid which could not reach you under fifti
dai
now when she saw the great of the danger tua grew quit calm and
answer
you have done wrong asti if you foresaw all these thing of which i
never thought you should have warn pharaoh and hi council
queen i did warn them and merm warn them also but thei would not
listen sai that thei were but the idl dream of on who strive to
peep into the futur and see fals pictur there more pharaoh sent
for me himself and whilst thank me and merm my husband told me
that he had inquir into the matter and found no caus to distrust abi
or those under hi command moreov he forbad me to speak to your
majesti about it lest be but young and a woman you might be
frighten and your pleasur spoilt
who wa hi counsellor ask tua
a strang on i think queen you know hi waitingwoman merytra she
of whom he is so fond and who stood behind him with a fan thi night
ay i know her repli tua with emphasi she wa ever whisper
with that tall astrolog at the feast but doe pharaoh take counsel
with waitingladi of hi privat household
with thi waitingladi it seem queen perhap you have not heard all
her stori in the year befor your birth merytra came up the nile with
abi she wa then quit young and veri pretti on of abi women it
seem that the princ struck her for some fault and be clever she
determin to be reveng upon him soon she got her chanc for she
heard abi disclos to the astrolog kaku that same man whom you saw
tonight talk with her a plan that he had made to murder pharaoh and
declar himself king from which kaku dissuad him have thi secret
and be bold she fled at onc from the ship of abi and that night
told pharaoh everyth but he forgav abi and sent him home again
with honour who should have slain him for hi treason onli merytra
remain in the court and from that time forward pharaoh who trust
her and wa caught by her wit and beauti made it a habit to send for
her when he wish to have new of memphi where she wa born becaus
she seem alwai to know even the most secret thing that were pass
in that citi moreov often her inform prove true
that is not to be wonder at nurs see that doubtless it came
from thi kaku abi astrolog and magician
no queen it is not to be wonder at especi as she paid back
secret for secret well i believ that after i had warn pharaoh of
what i knew never mind how he sent for merytra who laugh the tale
to scorn and told him that abi hi brother had long ago abandon all
ambit be well content with hi great place and power which on
of hi son would inherit after him she told him also that the troop
were but assembl to do the greater honour to your majesti who had no
more loyal or love subject than the princ abi whom for her part she
hate with good caus as she love pharaoh and hi housewith good
caus if there were ani danger she ask would she dare to put herself
within the reach of abi the man that she had onc betrai becaus her
heart wa pure and true and she wa faith to her king so pharaoh
believ her and i obei the order of pharaoh know that if i
did not do so he would grow angri and perhap separ me from you my
belov queen and fosterl which now that rame ha gone would i
think have meant my death yet i fear that i have er
ye i fear also that you have er asti but everyth is forgiven
to those who err through love answer tua kindli and kiss her
oh my father pharaoh what god fashion you so weak that an evil
spirit in a woman shape can plai the rudder to your polici leav me
now asti for i must sleep and call on amen to aid hi daughter the
snare is strong and cun but perchanc in my dream he will show
me how it mai be broke
that night when the feast wa end merytra pharaoh favour
waitingmaid did not return with the rest of the royal retinu to
the templ where he lodg as thei went from the hall in state she
whisper a few word into the ear of the chief butler of the household
who know that she had the royal pass to come in and out as she
would answer that the gate should be open to her and let her go
so cover her head with a dark cloak merytra slip behind a certain
statu in the antehal and wait till present a tall figur also

down sundri passag and up a narrow stair that seem almost endless

she thought a moment look at the wizen but powerfulfac old
magician then answer
i will take the oath and keep my share of it see that you keep your
kaku or it will be the wors for you for women have their own evil
power
i know it merytra and from the begin the wise have held that the
spirit dwell not in the heart or brain or liver but in the femal
tongu now stand up
she obei and from some hidden place in the wall kaku produc a book
or rather a roll of magic write that wa encas in iron the
metal of the evil god typhon
there is no other such book as thi he said for it wa written by
the greatest of wizard who live befor mena when the godk rule

and to everlast torment in the next at the claw and fang
of beasthead demon who dwell in the dark beyond the sun
appoint by name those be who should work the torment and
summon them as wit to the bond
merytra listen then said
you have left out your part of the oath friend name that you
promis that i shall be the onli wife of pharaoh vizier and hold equal
power with him
i forgot said kaku and ad the word
then thei both swore touch their brow with the book and as she
look up again merytra saw a strang flamelik light puls in
the crystal globe that hung abov her head which becam present
infiltr with crimson flow through it as blood might flow from a
wound till it glow dull red out of which red a great ey watch
her then the ey vanish and the blood vanish and in place of them
queen netertua sat in glori on her throne while the nation worship
her and by her side sat a man in royal robe whose face wa hidden in a
cloud
what do you see ask kaku follow her gaze to the crystal
she told him and he ponder a while then answer doubtfulli

guard and he sai that she came to the gate accompani by a tall man
wrap in a dark cloak who spoke with her earnestli and left her

first chariot and tua attend by abi eldest daughter a roundei
ladi much older than herself in the second next came the offic of
the priest of amen over which netertua as daughter of amen and
highpriestess must presid to dedic the templ to the glori of the
god then the foundat deposit of littl vase of offer and model
of workmen tool and a ring drawn from pharaoh hand engrav with
hi royal name were bless and set by the mason in hollow prepar
for them and the two great cornerston let down hide them for
ever and declar respect by pharaoh and by netertua morn
star of amen joint sovereign of egypt to be well and truli laid
afterward architect those who drew the line exhibit plan of the
templ and receiv gift from pharaoh and when these thing were done
came the middai feast and speech
at length all wa over and the great process return by anoth
rout to the templ of sekhet where pharaoh lodg a veri tediou
journei in the hot sun sinc it involv a circuit of the endless wall
of memphi with stoppag befor all the templ of the god at each
of which pharaoh must make offer nor weari as he wa might he
rest for in the outer court of the old shrine throne had been set up
and seat on them he and tua must hear petit till sunset and give
judgment or postpon them for further consider
at last there came to an end but as pharaoh tire out rose from hi
throne abi hi brother who all thi time had not left them said that
he also had a privat petit to prefer so thei went into an inner
court that had been a sanctuari and sat down again there be present

histori of the land ani queen of egypt had ever marri her uncl
the councillor who wa note for hi histor studi answer that
at the moment he could recal no such case
then said tua coolli and still address him it seem that it
would be scarc wise to creat a preced which other poor young
women of the royal race might be call upon to follow
pharaoh caught someth of the word though abi did not for thei were
spoken in a low voic and bethought him of a wai out of hi difficulti

come nurs said tua let us go to the roof and watch the set

so thei went support each other up the step for thei grew weak
from thi lofti place thei saw that save on the nile side of it which

at the sight of her clad in the mail which she still wore a murmur
rose from them like the murmur of the sea follow by a deep silenc
sinc thei dare not declar the piti which move them all in the midst
of thi silenc whilst the sun sank behind the pyramid of the ancient
king netertua lift up her gloriou voic and sang the even hymn
to amenra as the last note di awai in the still air again the
murmur rose while the dark gather about the pylon hide her from

so she laid herself down upon the bed and take her hand that had
grown so thin the tall and nobl asti bent over her in the dark
and began to sing a gentl chant or lullabi
tua ey close her breath came slow and deep then asti the magician
ceas her song and gather up her secret strength put out her

against the dai of judgment when we all shall meet and plead our caus

there you shall find that royal loveli which you desir take it to
be your wife as you desir for it shall not sai you nai be wed to
that loveli with pomp befor all the ey of egypt and reign by
right of that royalti until you meet on rame son of merm whom
you also murder and with him a certain beggarman who is charg with
anoth messag for you o abi ascend the nile to thebe and lai thi
bodi of mine in the splendid tomb which i have made readi and sit in
my seat and do those thing which that royal loveli you have wed
command to you for it you shall obei but hasten hasten abi to
hollow for yourself a grave and let it be near to mine for when you
ar dead thi my ka would come to visit you as it doe tonight
then the ka or the bodi of pharaohi know not which it wasceas
from speak and lai there a while stare at me with it cold ey
till at length the spirit of my four son who ar dead enter the
chamber and lift up the shape carri it awai i awok shake
like a reed in the wind and ran hither up a thousand step to find you
brawl with thi lowborn slut dead pharaoh wornout shoe that in
bygon year i kick from off my foot
now merytra would have answer for she love not such name but
the two men look at her so fierc that her rage di and she wa
silent
read me thi vision man and be swift for the torment of it haunt
me went on abi if you cannot i strip you of your offic and give
your carcas to the rod until you find wisdom it wa you who set me
on thi path and by the god you shall keep me safe in it or die by
inch
now see hi great danger kaku grew cold and cun
it is true o princ he said that i set you on thi path thi high
and splendid path and it is true also that from the begin i have
kept you safe in it had it not been for me and my counsel long ago
you would have becom but a forgotten traitor rememb that night at
thebe when in your pride you desir to smite at the heart of pharaoh
and how i held your hand and rememb how mani a time my wisdom ha
been your guid when left to your own rash folli you must have fail
or perish it is true also princ that in the futur as in the past
with me and by me you stand or fall yet if you think otherwis find
some wiser man to lead you and wait the end all the rod in egypt
cannot be broken on my back o abi now shall i speak who alon have
knowledg or will you seek anoth counsellor
speak on answer abi sullenli we ar fish in the same net and
share each other fortun to the end whether it be set gridiron or
fat egypt pleasur pond fear not what i have promis you shall have
while it is mine to give
just now you promis rod remark kaku make a wry face and
replac the remain of hi wig upon hi bald head but let that pass
now as to thi dream of your i find it mean good how did pharaoh
come to you not as a live spirit but in the fashion of a dead man
and who care for dead men
i do for on when thei cut my mouth with broken crystal
interrupt merytra who wa bath her wound in a basin of water
would that thei had cut your tongu instead of your lip woman
snarl abi continu kaku and heed her not
and what wa hi messag went on the magician why that you shall
marri the majesti of egypt and rule in her right and sit in the seat
of king ar not these the veri thing that you desir and have work
for year to win
ye kaku but you forget all that about on rame and the tomb that i
must hollow and the rest
rame merytra here can tell you of him princ he is the madcap young
count who kill the princ of kesh and wa sent by netertua far to
the southland that the barbarian there might make an end of him
without scandal if ever he should come back with the beggarman and
hi messag which is not like you can answer him with the halter he
deserv
ay kaku but how will the queen answer him there ar stori
afloat
li everi on of them princ she would have execut him at onc
had it not been for the influenc of merm and her fostermoth
asti thi rame ha in him the royal blood of the last dynasti and the
star of amen is not on who will share her sky with a rival star unless
he be her law lord which is your part if rame or the foul beggar
bring you ani messag it will be that you ar king of kesh as well as
of egypt and then you can kill him and take the heritag a fig for
rame and it stalk for the beggar
perhap repli abi more cheerfulli at ani rate i do not fear that
risk but how about all pharaoh talk of tomb
be dead princ it is natur that the mind of hi ka should run
on tomb and hi own royal burial which as a matter of polici we must
give to him besid there the prophesi wa safe sinc to these same
tomb all must come especi those of us who have seen the nile rise
over sixti timesa i have he ad hastili when we reach the tomb
it will be time to deal with it affair till then let us be content
with life and the good thing it offer such as throne and find the
love of the most beauti woman in the world and the rest harvest
your corn when it is ripe princ and do not troubl about next year
crop or whether in hi grave pharaoh doubl eat white bread or brown
pharaoh daughteror amensi your busi not hi ghost
ye good soothsay said abi she is my busi but on more
question why did that accurs mummi speak of her as itin my dream
i meana though she were no woman but someth beyond woman
for a moment kaku hesit for the point wa hard to answer then he
repli boldli
becaus as i believ princ thi queen with whom the god ar
reward your desert is in truth more than woman be amen veri
daughter and therefor in those realm whenc the dream came she is
known not as woman but by her titl of royal loveli oh went on
kaku simul an enthusiasm that in truth did not glow within hi
breast great and gloriou is your lot king of the world and splendid
the path which i have open to your triumphant feet it wa i who
show you how pharaoh might be trap in memphi be but a poor
fool easi to deceiv and it wa ior rather merytra yonderwho rid
you of him and now it is i the master whom you threaten with rod
that alon can interpret to you the happi omen of a dream which you
thought fearsom think of the end of it princ and banish everi
doubt who bore awai the shape of pharaoh why the spirit of your son
thu symbolis the triumph of your hous
at least thei will have no share in it kaku for thei ar dead said
abi with a groan for he had love hi son
what of that princ thei di brave and we mourn them but here
again fortun is with you for had thei live troubl might have arisen
between them and those other son which the queen of egypt shall bear to
you
mayhap mayhap repli abi wave hi hand for the subject wa
pain to him but thi queen is not yet my wife she is starv in
yonder tower and what am i to do if i try to forc my presenc upon
her she will destroi herself as she swore and if i leav her there ani
longer be mortal she must die moreov i dare not for even these
folk of memphi who love me begin to murmur egypt queen is egypt
queen and thei will not suffer that she should perish miser be
beauti and young and on who take all heart thi night at sunset
thei gather in ten of thousand round the tower to hear her sing that
even hymn to ra and afterward march past my palac shout
in the dark give food to her majesti and free her or we will
moreov by now the new must have come to thebe and there a great
armi will gather to liber or aveng her what am i to do prophet
do what dead pharaoh bade you in your dream princ at the hour of
dawn go to the templ of sekhet where you will find the queen becom
obedi to your wish for did not the dream declar that she will not
sai you nai then lead her to your palac and marri her in the face
of all men and rule by right of her majesti and of your own conquer
arm
it can be tri said abi for then at least we shall learn what
truth there is in dream but what of thi asti her companion
asti ha been an ill guid to her majesti princ repli kaku

hunger if she still live merytra here will take her in charg and care

which were pet of the same master well we shall have much to sai to
each other onli bewar husband asti is no weakl your magic mai
be strong but her is stronger for she is a great priestess and draw
it from godsnot devil
so it came about that at dawn princ abi clad in magnific robe and
accompani by councillor among them kaku and by a small guard wa
carri in a litter to the gate of the old templ of sekhet be too
heavi to walk so far and there descend as there were none to defend
them these gate were open easili enough and thei pass through
leav the guard without when thei came to the inner court abi
stop and ask where thei should search
in on place onli your high answer kaku that pylon tower
which overlook the nile for there her majesti starv with asti
pylon tower grumbl abi have i not climb enough step thi
night still lead on
so thei went to the narrow stair up which the thin kaku ran like a cat
while the offic push and led the huge abi behind him on the third
land thei all halt at abi command
hurri not he said in a thick whisper her majesti dwell on the next
floor of thi hate tower and sinc asti is with her she cannot be
surpris bewar then of frighten her by your sudden appear
lest she should run to the top of the pylon and hurl herself into the
nile as she ha sworn that she will do halt now and i will call to
her when i have got my breath
so after a while he call sai
o queen ceas to starv yourself in thi miser abod and come
down to dwell in plenti with your faith subject
he call it onc and twice and thrice but there wa no answer now
abi grew afraid
she must have perish he said and egypt will demand her blood at
my hand kaku go up and see what ha happen you ar a magician and
have noth to fear
but the astrolog thought otherwis and hesit till abi in a rage
lift hi cedar wand to strike him on the back then he went step by
step slowli paus at each step to address prayer and prais to her
majesti of egypt at length he came to the door of the queen chamber
and kneel down peep into it to see that it wa quit empti next
he crawl across the land to the chamber opposit that which
had been asti and found it empti also then made bold by fear he
ascend to the pylon roof but here too there wa no on to be seen
so he return and told abi who shout

on me or she ha sought death in the nile to rais the god upon me
which is wors so much for your interpret of dream o cheat
wait till you ar sure befor you call me such name princ repli
kaku indignantli let us search the templ she mai be elsewher

up hi throne while he sojourn at memphi thi hall wa a dark place
into which light flow onli through the grate in the clerestori
be roof in with block of granit laid upon it lotusshap
column now at the hour of sunris the gloom in it wa still deep
so deep that the searcher felt their wai from pillar to pillar see

thei shrank back thei huddl themselv togeth in the doorwai and

chapter xii
the royal marriag
a strang rumour ran through memphi it wa said that the queen had
yield it wa said that she would marri the princ abi that she
wa alreadi at the great white hous wait to be made a bride men
wrangl about in the street thei swore that it could not be true for
would thi high ladi the anoint pharaoh of egypt take her father
murder and her own uncl to husband would she not rather die in her
prison tower on which night by night thei had seen her stand and sing
in their heart thei thought that she should die for thu thei had
sum her up thi pure highheart daughter of amen whom fate had
caught in an evil net ye be men thei held that she ought to die
and leav a stori in the world whereof egypt could be proud for ever
but their wive and daughter mock at them after all she wa but a
woman thei argu and wa it like that she would throw asid the
pomp of rule and the prospect of long year in order to steal awai into
the shadow of a forgotten tomb henceforth it wa true she must take
second place for abi would be a stern master to her still ani place
wa better than a funer barg she had felt the pinch of hunger yonder
in that old templ her fierc spirit had been tame she had kiss the
rod and after long year of wait abi would be pharaoh in egypt
the disput grew hot for even those men who rebel against her in
their heart had set her high and griev to think of her the divin
ladi bow her neck to the common yoke of circumst and sell
herself for safeti and a seat on the step of her own throne but the
women mock on and show them that as thei had alwai said she wa
no better than other of her sex
present the matter wa settl for herald appear cry throughout
the citi that the marriag would take place in the great hall of the
white hous on hour befor sundown then the women laugh in triumph
and the men were silent
it wa the appoint hour and that hall wa fill to overflow by
all who could gain entranc there between the tower obelisk that
stood on either side the open cedar door folk hung upon it step like
hive bee the vast squar without and all the street that led to it
were black with them here it is true thei could see noth still
thei fought for the merest foothold and some of those who fell never
rose again at the head of the hall were set two throne the greater
and the richer throne for abi the princ the lesser throne for
netertua the queen he had arrang it thu sinc kaku the cun
point out to him that from the first he should show the peopl that it
wa he who rule and not pharaoh daughter
it wa the appoint hour and at some signal from everi templ top rang
out the blare of trumpet thrice thei sound and echo into silenc
in that hot still air thu announc that in the templ of hathor
and the presenc of the priest of all the god the hand of abi and
netertua had been join in marriag
anoth rumour began to run among the crowd like the ring set circl
by a stone in water it spread from mouth to mouth ever widen as it
went
marvel had happen in the templ of hathor that wa the rumour
moreov it gave detail that the highpriest had hand to the bride
the accustom lotusbud the flower of the goddess and lo it open
in her hand also it wa said that present the stem of it turn
to a sceptr of gold and the cup of the bloom to sapphir stone more
perfect far than ani from the desert mine
nor wa thi all so went the tale for when as he must the bridegroom
abi offer the white dove to hathor in her shrine a hawk swept through
the doorwai and smote it in hi veri hand ye there in the gloom of
the shrine smote it and left it dead blood run from it beak and
breast dead upon the knee of the goddess left it and wa gone again
now what hawk ask the peopl of each other dare such a deed as
thi unless in truth it wa sent by the hawkhead horu the son of
amenra
soon these matter were forgotten for the moment sinc now it wa known
that the royal pair were enter the great white hall there to show
themselv to the peopl and receiv the homag of the nobl chief
and captain first advanc by the cover wai which led from the
templ of hathor appear the priest in their robe chant as thei
walk follow by the master of ceremoni butler and herald
next surround by hi offic and guard came the princ abi himself
accompani by hi vizier kaku he whose magic wa said to have brought
pharaoh to hi end
not all hi pomp nor the splendour of hi apparel whereof the
white as mani note wa spot with illomen blood nor even
the royal crown which now for the first time wa set upon hi huge
round head could hide from those who watch that thi bridegroom wa
ill at eas even as he stood there bow in answer to the obsequi
shout of the multitud the sceptr in hi fat hand shook and hi red
lip blanch and trembl still he smile and bow on till at length
the shout di awai and quiet fell upon the place
abi wa forgotten thei wait the come of the queen and though no
herald call her advent yet everi heart of all those thousand felt
that she drew near to them look yonder she stood thei had watch
close enough yet none saw her come doubtless becaus the shadow
were thick but there she stood quit alon upon the edg of the dai
in front of the two throne and oh she wa differ from what thei
had expect thu now she wore no gorgeou robe but onli a simpl
garment of purest white cut low upon her bosom where the red rai of
the sink sun strike up the hall reveal to everi ey that dark
mole shape like the cross of life which wa her wondrou birthmark
but two ornament adorn her the doubl snake of royalti golden with
red ey set in front of her tall white headdress which none but
she might wear the crown of upper and of lower egypt and of all
the subject land and in her hand a sceptr fashion of gold and
surmount by a lotusbloom of sapphir that sceptr of which rumour
had told the magic tale
ye she wa differ thei had thought to see a woman weak and pale
her ey still red with grief her face still stain with tear on
who had been tame by misfortun hunger and the fear of death whenc
she had bought herself by marriag with her conqueror but it wa not
so for never had the star of amen shone half so beauti never had
thei seen such majesti in those deep blue ey that look them through
and through as though thei read the secret heart of everi on of them
her tall and love form had not wast her cheek were red with the
glow of health power and digniti flow from her presenc fear seem
beneath her feet
now no voic wa lift up thei stare at her and smile a littl
she answer them with her calm ey till their head sank beneath her
gaze then at length in the midst of that dead oppress silenc which
none dare to break she turn and thei heard the sweep of her silken
robe upon the alabast floor
with an effort two chamberlain step forward their wand of offic
in their hand to lead her to her seat but she wave them back and
said in her clear voic
nai here i am alon of all the million who serv her not on is
left to lead amen daughter and egypt queen to her right place
therefor she take it of her own strength now and for evermor
then veri slowli still in the midst of silenc she mount the greater
throne that had been prepar for abi and there seat herself and
wait
now murmur rose among the courtier and kaku whisper into abi
ear while the multitud held it breath abi stamp hi foot and
issu order which all seem to fear to execut at length he step
forward address the queen in a hoars voic
ladi he said doubtless you know it not but that place is mine
your seat is on my left be pleas to take it
why so princ abi she ask quietli
ladi he answer becaus the husband take preced of the wife

voic should you not have saidth murder of the murder and hi
seed nai princ abi you ar wrong the sovereign of egypt by right

god whose will she ha come to execut to command her to give to him
the name of husband until that will is more fulli known come now and do
homag to your queen and after you those slave of your who dare to
lift the sword against her
then a great tumult aros a tumult of rage and of dismai for well nigh
all in that vast place were partner in thi crime and knew that if
netertua prevail death yawn wide for them
thei shout to abi to take no heed of her thei shout to him to tear
her from the throne to kill her and seiz the crown thei drew their
sword and rage like an angri sea those who were loyal among them to
pharaoh hous and those who fear turmoil began to work their wai
backward and slip by two and three out of the great open door
till tua had no friend left in all that hall but ever as thei went

slaughter of pharaoh guard took their place pour in from the mob
without

she end her prayer and sink back upon the throne rest her chin
upon her hand and gaze steadili upon the splendour of the sink sun
nor did she gaze alon for everi man in that vast hall turn himself
about and stare at it depart glori there in the red light thei
stood and stare and sinc the place wa open to the sky the shadow
of the two tower obelisk without fell on them like the shadow of
sword whereof the point met togeth at the foot of tua throne thei
did not believ that anyth would happen no not even the priest
believ it who here at memphi the citi of ptah thought littl of
amen the god of thebe thei thought that thi piteou prayer wa but
a last cry of dy faith wrung from a proud and fallen woman in her
wretched
and yet and yet thei stare for she had spoken with a strang
certainti like on who knew the god and wa she not name star of
amen and were there not wondrou tale as to her birth and had not a
lotusbloom seem to turn to gold and jewel in the hand of thi young
anoint queen who bore the cross of life upon her breast no noth
would happen but still thei stare
it wa a veri strang sunset for dai the heat had been great but now
it wa fear also a marvel still reign in heaven and earth
noth seem to stir in all the citi no dog bark no child cri
no leaf quiver upon the tall palm it might have been a citi of the
dead
dens cloud aros upon the sky and move though no wind blew where
the sun rai touch them thei were gold and red and purpl but abov
these of an inki black thei took strang shape those cloud and
marshal themselv like a host gather for battl there were the
command move quickli to and fro there the chariot and there the
sullen line of footmen with their gleam spear now on cloud higher
than the rest seem to shoot itself across the arch of heaven and it
fashion wa that of a woman with outspread hair of gold her feet stood
upon the sun her bodi bent itself athwart the sky and upon the far
horizon in the east her hand held the pale globe of the rise moon
the watcher were frighten at thi cloud it is isi with the moon in
her arm said on nai it is the mother goddess nout brood upon
the world answer anoth and though thei onli spoke softli in that
aw silenc their voic reach tua on the throne and for the first
time her face chang for on it came a cold curiou smile
kaku began to whisper into abi ear and there wa fear in the ey of
both of them he point with hi finger at two star which of a sudden
shone out through the green haze abov the sunset glow and then turn
and look at the queen urg hi master eagerli at last abi spoke
ra is set he said come let us make an end of all thi folli
not yet answer tua quietli not yet awhil
as she said the word of a sudden as though at a given signal all the
long line of palm tree that grew in the rich garden upon the river
bank were seen to bow themselv toward the east as though thei did
obeis to the queen upon her throne thrice thei bow thu without
a wind and then were straight and still onc more next the cloud
rush togeth as though a black pall had been drawn across the
heaven onli in the west the halfhidden globe of the sun shone on
through an open in them shone like a great and furiou ey by slow
degre it sank till noth wa left save a littl rim of fire all
the hall grew dark and through the dark netertua could be heard
call on the name of amen
ra is dead shout a voic have done bastard ra is dead
ay she answer in a cold triumphant cry but amen live behold
hi sword ye traitor
as the word left her lip the heaven were cleft in twain by a fear
flash of lightn and in it the peopl saw that onc again the
palmtre bow themselv thi time almost to the ground then with a
roar the wind were loos and beneath their feet the solid earth began
to heav as though a giant lift it thrice it heav like a heav
wave and the third time through the thick cover of the dark there
rose a shriek of terror and of agoni follow by the aw crash of
fall stone
now the whole sky seem to melt in fire and in that fierc light wa

chapter xiv
the boat of ra
tua star of amen open her ey for some time alreadi she had lain
as on li between sleep and wake and it seem to her that she
heard the sound of dip oar and of water that rippl gentli
against the side of a ship she thought to herself that she dream
doubtless she wa in her bed in the palac at thebe and present
when it wa light her ladi would come to waken her
in the palac at thebe why now she rememb that it wa month
sinc she had seen that royal citi she who had travel far sinc
then and come at last to whitewal memphi where mani terribl
thing had befallen her on by on thei came into her mind the snare
pharaoh murder by magic the battl and the slaughter of her guard
the starvat in the tower with death on on hand and the hate abi
on the other the wondrou vision of that spirit who wore her face and
said she wa the guardian ka given to her at birth the word it spoke
and her dread resolv and last of all asti and herself stand in
the lofti window nich then a flame of fire befor her face and that
fear downward rush
oh without a doubt it wa over she wa dead and these dream and
memori were such as come to the dweller in the underworld onli then
why did she hear the sound of lap water and of dip oar
veri slowli she open her ey for tua greatli fear what she might
see light flow upon her the light of the moon which hung in a clear
sky like some great lamp of gold by it she saw that robe all in
white she lai upon a couch in a pavilion whereof the silken curtain
were drawn back in front and ti to gild post at her side wrap
in a grei robe lai anoth figur which she knew for asti it wa
still so still that she wa sure it must be dead yet she knew that
thi wa asti perchanc asti dream also and could hear in her
dream at least she would speak to her
asti she whisper asti can you hear me
the grei figur at her side stir and the head turn toward her
then the voic of asti none other answer
ay ladi i hear and see but sai where ar we now
in the underworld i think asti oh that fire wa death and now we
journei to the place of soul
if so ladi it is strang that we should still have ey and flesh and
voic as mortal women have let us sit up and look
so thei sat up their arm about each other and peer through the open
curtain behold thei were on a ship more beauti than ani thei had
ever seen for it seem to be cover with gold and silver while sweet
odour float from it hold their pavilion wa set in the centr of
the ship and look aft thei perceiv line of whiteclad rower
seat at their oar in the shadow of the bulwark and on the high
sternalso robe in whitea tall steersman whose face wa veil
behind whom in the dim glimps of the moon thei caught sight of a wide
and silveri river and on it distant bank palm and templ tower
it is the boat of ra murmur tua which bear us down the river of
death to the kingdom behind the sun
then she sank back upon her cushion and onc more fell into swoon or
sleep
tua woke again and lo the sun wa shine brightli and at her side
sat asti watch her moreov in front of them wa set a tabl spread
with delic food
tell me what ha chanc nurs she said faintli for i am
bewild and know not in what world we wander
our own queen i think answer asti but in charg of those who
ar not of it for sure thi is no mortal boat nor do mortal guid
her to her port come we need food let us eat while we mai
so thei at and drank heartili enough and when thei had finish even
dare to go out of the pavilion look around them thei saw that thei
stood upon a high deck in the midst of a great ship but that thi ship
wa enclos with a net of silver cord in which thei could find no
open look through it mesh thei note that the oar were
inboard and the great purpl sail set upon the mast also that the
rower were gone perchanc to rest beneath the deck while on the
forecastl of the ship stood the captain whiterob and mask and
aft the steersman also still mask so that thei could see noth of
their face now too thei were no longer sail on a river but down
a canal border by bank of sand on either side beyond which stretch
desert farther than the ey could reach
asti studi the desert then turn and said
i think i know thi canal ladi for onc i sail it as a child i
think it is that which wa dug by the pharaoh of old and repair
after the fall of the hykso king and that it run from bubasti to
that bai down which wander sail toward the rise sun
mayhap answer tua at least thi is the world that bore us and no
other and by the merci of amen and the power of my spirit we ar still
aliv and not dead or so it seem call now to the captain on yonder
deck perhap he will tell whither he bear us in hi magic ship
so asti call but the captain made no sign that he saw or heard her
next she call to the steersman but although hi veil face wa
toward them he also made no sign so that at last thei believ either
that these were spirit or that thei were men born deaf and dumb in the
end grow weari of stare at thi beauti ship at the canal and
the desert beyond it and of wonder where thei were and how thei
came thither thei return to the pavilion to avoid the heat of the
sun here thei found that dure their absenc some hand unseen had
arrang the silken bedcloth on their couch and clear awai the
fragment of their meal reset the beauti tabl with other food
truli here is wizardri at work said tua as she sank into a
leathers ivori chair that wa place readi
who doubt it answer asti calmli by wizardri were you born by
wizardri wa pharaoh slain by wizardri we ar save to an end that we
cannot guess by wizardri or what men so name doe the whole world
move onli be so near we see it not
tua thought a while then said
well thi golden ship is better than the sty of abi the hog nor do i
believ that we journei to no purpos still i wonder what that spirit
who name herself my ka doe on the throne of egypt also how we came on
board thi boat and whither we sail
wonder not for all these thing we shall learn in due season and for
my part although i hate him i am sorri for abi answer asti drili
so thei sat there in the pavilion watch the desert over the sand
of which their ship seem to move till at length the sun grew low
and thei went to walk upon the deck then thei return to eat of the
delici food that wa alwai provid for them in such plenti and at
nightfal sought their couch and slept heavili for thei need rest
when thei awok again it wa daylight though no sun shone through the
ski and their vessel roll onward across a wide and sullen sea out
of sight of land also the silken pavilion about them wa gone and
replac by a cabin of massiv cedar wood though of thi be sate
with marvel tua and asti took littl note inde have neither of
them been on an angri ocean befor a strang dizzi overcam them
which caus them to sleep much and think littl for three whole dai
and night
at length on even as the sun sank thei perceiv that the violent
motion of the vessel had ceas with the roar of the gale abov
which for all thi while had driven them onward at such fear speed
ventur from their cedar hous thei saw that thei had enter the
mouth of a great river upon the bank of which grew enorm tree that
sent out long crook root into the water and that among these root
crouch crocodil and other noisom reptil also the whiterob
oarsmen had appear again and as there wa no wind row the ship up
the river till at length thei came to a spit of sand which jut out
into the stream and here cast anchor
now tua and asti desir for food return to them and thei at
just as thei had finish their meal and the sun wa sink suddenli
there appear befor them two mask men each of whom bore a basket
in hi hand asti began to question them but like the captain and
the steersman thei seem to be deaf and dumb at least thei made no
answer onli prostrat themselv humbl and point toward the shore
where now tua saw a fire burn on a rock though who had lit it she
did not know
thei mean us to leav the ship said asti come queen let us follow
our fortun for doubtless these ar high
as you will answer tua see that we should scarc have been
brought here to no end
so thei accompani the men to the side of that splendid vessel for now
the net that confin them had been remov to find that a gangwai
had been laid from it bulwark to the shore as thei step on to
thi gangwai their mask companion hand to each of them on of the
basket then again bow humbl and were gone soon thei gain the
bank and scarc had their feet touch it when the gangwai wa
withdrawn and the great oar began to beat the muddi water
round swung the ship and for a minut hung in midstream there stood
the captain on the foredeck and there wa the steersman at the helm
and the red light of the sink sun turn them into figur of flame
suddenli with a simultan motion these men tore off their mask so
that for a moment asti and tua saw their facesand behold the face of
the captain wa the face of pharaoh tua father and the face of the
steersman wa the face of merm asti husband
for on moment onli did thei see them then a dark cloud hid the dy
sun and when it pass that ship wa gone whither thei knew not
the two women look at each other and for the first time were much
afraid
truli said tua we ar haunt if ever mortal were for yonder ship
ha ghost for marin
ay ladi answer asti so have i thought from the first still
take heart for these ghost onc were men who love us well and
doubtless thei love us still be sure that for no ill purpos have we
been snatch out of the hand of abi and brought live and unharm by
the shade of pharaoh your sire and merm my husband to thi secret
shore see yonder burn a fire let us go to it and await what mai
befal brave know that at least it can be naught but good
so thei went to the rock and dark be come sat themselv down
by the fire alongsid of which lai wood for it replenish and near
the wood soft robe of camelhair to shield them from the cold
these robe thei put on with thank and have fed the flame
bethought them of and open the basket which were given to them when
thei left the ship the first basket that which asti held thei found
to contain food cake dri meat and date as much as on woman
could carri but the second that which had been given to tua wa
otherwis provid for in the mouth of it lai a love harp of ivori
with golden string whereof the frame wa fashion to the shape of a
woman tua drew it out and look at it by the light of the fire
it is my own harp she said in an aw voic the harp that the
princ of kesh whom rame slew brought as a gift to me to the note
of which i sang the song of the lover but just befor the giver di
ye it is my own harp that i left in thebe sai now nurs how came
it here
how came we here answer asti shortli answer my question and i
will answer your
then lai down the harp tua look again into her basket and
found that beneath a layer of dri papyru leav were hidden pearl
thousand of pearl of all size and of such lustr and beauti as she
had never seen thei were strung upon thread of silk all those of a
like size be set upon a singl thread except the veri biggest which
were as great as a finger nail or even larger that lai wrap up
separ in cloth at the bottom of the basket
sure said tua amaz no queen in all the earth ever had a dower
of such priceless pearl moreov what good thei and the harp can be
to us in thi forest i mai not guess
doubtless we shall discov in due cours answer asti meanwhil
let us thank the god for their gift and eat
so thei at and then have noth els to do lai down by the fire
and would have slept
but scarc had thei close their ey when the forest seem to awak
first from down by the river there came dread roar which thei
knew must be the voic of lion for there were tame beast of thi sort
in the garden at thebe next thei heard the whine and wimper of
wolv and jackal and mingl with them great snort such as ar
made by the rhinocero and the riverhors
nearer nearer came these aw sound till at length thei saw yellow
ey move like star in the dark at the edg of the forest while
cross the patch of sand beneath their rock gallop swift shape which
halt and snif toward them also on the river side of them appear
huge hoglik beast with gleam tusk and red cavern mouth
and beyond these again crash through the brushwood a gigant brute
that bore a singl horn upon it snout
now our end is at hand said tua faintli for sure these creatur
will devour us
but asti onli threw more wood upon the fire and wait think that
the flame would frighten them awai yet it did not for so curiou or
so hungri were thei that the lion crept and crept nearer and still
more near till at length thei lai lash their tail in the distanc
almost within spring distanc of the rock while on the farther side
of these like a court wait on it monarch gather the hyena and
other beast
thei will spring present whisper tua
did the spirit of the divin pharaoh your father and of merm my
lord bring us here in the boat of ra that we should be devour by wild
anim like lost sheep in the desert ask asti then as though by
an inspir she ad ladi take that harp of your and plai and
sing to it
so tua took the harp and swept it golden chord and lift up her
love voic she began to sing at first it trembl a littl but by
degre as she forgot all save the music it grew strong and rang out
sweetli in the silenc of the forest and the great slowmov river
and lo as she sang thu the wild brute grew still and seem to
listen as though thei were charm ye even a snake wriggl out from
between the rock and listen wave it crest head to and fro
at length tua ceas and as the echo di awai the brute everi on
of them turn and vanish into the forest or the river all save the
snake that coil itself up and slept where it wa so still came
again and tua and asti slept also nor did thei wake until the sun wa
shine in the heaven
then thei aros wonder and went down over the patch of sand that wa
mark with the footprint of all the beast to the river brink and
drank and wash themselv peer the while through the mist for
thei thought that perchanc thei would see that golden ship with the
veil crew which had carri them from memphi return and await
them in midstream
but no ship wa there noth wa there except the riverhors which
rose and sank and the crocodil on the mudbank and the wildfowl
that flight inward from the sea to feed so thei went back to the
ash of their fire and at of the food in asti basket and when thei
had eaten look at each other not know what to do then tua said
come nurs let us be go up the river and down the river we cannot
walk for there ar noth but weed and mud so we must strike out
through the forest whither the god mai lead us
asti nod and clad in the light warm cloth of camelhair thei set
the basket upon their head after the fashion of the peasant women of
egypt and start forward the harp of ivori and of gold hang upon
tua back
for hour after hour thei march thu through the forest thread
their path between the big bole of the tree and head alwai for
the south for that wai ran the woodland glade beyond which wa dens
bush great ap chatter abov them in the tree top and now
and again some beast of prei cross their path and vanish in the
underwood but noth els did thei see at length toward middai the
ground began to rise and the tree grew smaller and farther apart till
at last thei reach the edg of a sandi desert and walk out to a
littl oasi where the green grass show them thei would find water
in thi oasi there wa a spring and by the edg of it thei sat down
and drank and at of their store of food and afterward slept a while
suddenli tua in her sleep heard a voic and awak with a
start saw a man who stood near by lean on a thornwood staff and
contempl them he wa a veri strang man appar of great ag
for hi long white hair fell down upon hi shoulder and hi white
beard reach to hi middl onc he must have been veri tall but now
he wa bent with ag and the bone of hi gaunt frame thrust out hi
rag garment hi dark ey also were horni inde it seem as
though he could scarc see with them for he lean forward to peer at
their face where thei lai hi face wa score by a thousand wrinkl
and almost black with exposur to the sun and wind but yet of a
marvel tender and beauti inde except that it wa far more
ancient and the featur were on a larger and a grander scale it

asti

rock and from the crest of it perceiv a larg wall town set in a
green and fertil vallei not veri far beneath them toward thi town
kepher who march at a distanc in front guid them till thei
reach a clump of tree on the outskirt of the cultiv land here

chapter xv
tua and the king of tat
in the morn after tua and asti had put on the clean robe that lai
to their hand and eaten suddenli thei look up and perceiv that
kepher the ancient beggar of the desert wa in the room with them
though neither of them had heard or seen him enter
you come silent friend said asti look at him with a curiou
ey a doubl could not move with less nois andwher is your
shadow she ad stare first at the sun without and then at the
floor upon which he stood
i forgot it he answer in hi deep voic on so poor as i am
cannot alwai afford a shadow but look there it is now and for the
rest what do you know of doubl which those who ar uninstruct
cannot discern now i have heard of a ladi in egypt who by some chanc
bore your name and who ha the power not onli to see the doubl but
to draw it forth from the bodi of the live and furnish it with everi
semblanc of mortal life also i have heard that she who reign in egypt
todai ha such a ka or doubl that can take her place and none know
the differ save that thi ka which amen gave her at her birth
work the vengeanc of the god without piti or remors tell me friend
asti when you were a slavewoman in egypt did you ever hear talk of
such thing as these
now he look at asti and asti look at him till at length he move
hi old hand in a certain fashion whereon she bow her head and wa
silent
but tua who wa terrifi at thi talk for she knew not what would
befal them if the truth were guess broke in sai
welcom father howev it mai pleas you to come and with or without
a shadow sure we have much to thank you for who have found us thi
fine hous and servant and foodbi the wai will you not eat again
nai he answer smile as you mai have guess yesterdai i touch
meat seldom as a rule onc onli in three dai and then take my fill
life is so short that i cannot wast time in eat
oh said tua if you feel thu whose youth began more than a hundr
year ago how must it seem to the rest of us but father kepher what
ar we to do in thi town tat
i have told you maiden asti here will deal in pearl and other good
and you will sing but alwai behind the curtain sinc here in tat you
must suffer no man to see your beauti and least of all him who rule
it now give me two more pearl for i go out to bui for you other
thing that ar need and after that perhap you will see me no
more for a long while yet if troubl should fall upon you go to the
windowplac wherev you mai be and strike upon that harp of your
and call thrice upon the name of kepher doubtless there will be some
listen who will hear you and bring me the new in the desert where i
dwell who do not love town and then i mai be abl to help you
i thank you my father and i will rememb but pardon me if i ask how
can on so and she paus
so old so rag and so miser give help to man or womanthat is
what you would sai daughter nefert is it not well judg not from
the outward seem good wine is often found in jar of common clai
and the fire hid in a rough flint can destroi a citi
and therefor a wander who can swallow hi own shadow can aid anoth
wander in distress remark tua drili my father i understand
who although i am still young have seen mani thing and er now been
drag out of deep water by strang hand
such as those of phoenician pirat suggest kepher well goodby
i go to purchas what you need with the price of these pearl and then
the desert call me for a while rememb what i told you and do
not seek to leav thi town of tat until the rain ha fallen on the
mountain and there is water in the well goodby friend asti also
when i come again we will talk more of doubl until which time mai
the great god of egypth is call amen is he nothav you and your
ladi in hi keep
then he turn and went
what is that man ask tua when thei had heard the door of the hous
close behind him
man answer asti i have told you that he is no man do men unfold
their shadow like a garment he is a god or a ghost wear a beggar
shape
man or ghost i like him well for he ha befriend us in our need
nurs
that we shall know when he ha done with us answer asti
an hour later whilst thei were still talk of kepher and all the
marvel that had befallen them porter began to arriv bear bundl
which when open were found to contain silk and broideri in gold
and silver thread and leather richli work such as the arab make
and alabast pot of ointment and brass work from syria and copper
jar from cypru with mani other good all veri costli and in number
more than enough for a wealthi trader store
these good the porter set out on the mat and shelv of the larg
front room of the hous that open to the street which room seem to
have been built to receiv them then thei depart ask no fee
and there appear a man ride a fine white hors who dismount and
bow low toward the screen of pierc woodwork behind which tua and
asti were hidden laid a write upon a littl tabl and rode awai
when he had gone asti open the door in the screen and took the write
which she found she could read well enough for it wa in the egyptian
charact and languag
it prove to be the titlede of the hous and garden convei to them
jointli and also of the rich good which the porter had brought at
the foot of thi document wa written
receiv by kepher the wander in payment of the abov hous and land
and good three pearl and on full meal of meat and date
then follow the seal of kepher in wax a fine cut scarabu hold
the symbol of the sun between it two front feet
a proud seal for a tatter wander though it is but hi name writ in
wax said tua
but asti onli answer
if small pearl have such valu in thi citi what price will the larg
on bring well let us to our busi for we have time upon our
hand and cannot live upon pearl and costli stuff
so it happen that netertua star of amen queen of egypt and asti
her nurs the mistress of magic becam merchant in the town of tat
thi wa the manner of their trade for on hour in the morn and on
in the afternoon asti heavili veil and a woman of the servant whom
thei had found in the hous would sit on stool amidst the good and
traffic with all comer sell to those who would bui and take
payment in gold dust or other articl of valu or bui from those
who would sell then when the hour drew toward it close tua would
sweep her harp behind the screen that hid her and begin to sing whereon
all would ceas from their chaffer and listen for never befor had
thei heard so sweet a voic inde at these time the broad street
in front of their hous wa pack with peopl for the fame of thi
sing of her went through the citi and far into the countri that
lai beyond then the traffic came to an end with her song and leav
their good in charg of the servant tua and asti depart to the back
room of the hous and at their meal or wander in the larg wall
garden that lai behind
thu the week went on and soon although thei sold few of the pearl
and those the smallest for of the larger gem thei said littl or
noth thei began to grow rich and to hoard up such a weight of gold
in dust and nugget and so mani preciou thing that thei scarc
knew what thei should do with them still tat seem to be a peac
citi or at the least none tri to rob or molest them perhap becaus
a rumour wa abroad that these stranger who had come out of the unknown
were under the protect of some god
there wa noth to show how or why thi rumour had arisen in the citi
but on account of it if for no other reason these pearlmerch
as thei were call suffer no wrong and although thei were onli
undefend women whatev credit thei might give the debt wa alwai
paid also their servant to whom thei ad as thei had mean were
all faith to them so there thei remain and trade keep their
secret and await the appoint hour of escap but never ventur
to leav the shelter of their own wall
now as it happen when thei came thither the king of tat wa awai
make war upon anoth king whose countri lai upon the coast but after
thei had dwelt for mani week in the place thi king who wa name
jane return victori from hi war and prepar to celebr a
triumph
while he wa make readi for thi triumph hi courtier told him of
these pearlmerch and desir pearl for hi adorn on that
great dai he went in disguis to the hous of those who sold them as
it chanc he arriv late and request to see the gem just as tua
accord to her custom wa plai upon her harp then she began to
sing and thi king jane who wa a man of under forti year of ag
listen intent to her beauti voic forget all about the
pearl that he had come to bui her song finish the veil asti rose
and bow to all the compani gather in the street bade her servant
shut up the coffer and remov the good
but i would bui pearl merchant if you have such to sell said
jane
then you must return thi afternoon purchas repli asti scan
hi pale and haughti face for even if you were the king of tat i would
not sell to you out of my hour
you speak high word woman exclaim jane angrili
high or low thei ar what i mean answer asti and went awai
the end of it wa that thi king jane return at the even hour
led thither more by a desir to hear that love voic again than to
purchas gem still he ask to see pearl and asti show him some
which he thrust asid as too small then she produc those that were
larger and again he thrust them asid and so it went on for a long
while at length from somewher in her cloth asti drew two of the
biggest that she had perfect pearl of the size of the middl nail of
a man finger and at the sight of these the ey of jane brighten
for such gem he had never seen befor then he ask the price asti
answer carelessli that it wa doubtless more than he would wish to
pai sinc there were few such pearl in the whole world and she name
a weight in gold that caus him to step back from her amaz for it
wa a quarter of the tribut that he had taken from hi newconqu
kingdom
woman you jest he said sure there is some abat
man she answer i jest not there is no abat and she
replac the pearl in her garment
now he grew veri angri and ask
did you know that i am the king of tat and if i will can take your
pearl without ani payment at all
ar you ask asti look at him coolli i should never have
guess it well if you steal my good as you sai you can you will be
king of thiev also
now those who heard thi sai laugh and the king thought it best to
join in their merriment then the bargain went on but befor it wa
finish at her appoint hour tua began to sing behind the screen
have done said the king to asti tomorrow you shall be paid your
price i would listen to that music which is abov price
so jane listen like on fascin for tua wa sing her best
step by step he drew ever nearer to the screen though thi asti did
not notic for she wa engag in lock up her good at length
he reach it and thrust hi finger through the open in the
pierc woodwork rest hi weight upon it like a man who is faint as
perhap he wa with the sweet of that music then of a sudden by
craft or chanc he swung himself backward and with him came the frail
screen down it clatter to the floor and lo beyond it unveil but
clad in rich attir stood tua sweep her harp of ivori and gold like
sunlight from a cloud the bright vision of her beauti struck the ey of
the peopl gather there and seem to dazzl them sinc for a while
thei were silent then on said
sure thi woman is a queen and anoth answer
nai she is a goddess but er the word had left hi lip tua wa
gone
as for jane the king he stare at her openmouth reel a littl
upon hi feet then as she fled turn to asti sai
is thi ladi your slave
nai king my daughter whom you have done ill to spy upon
then said jane slowli i who might do less desir to make thi
daughter of your my queendo you understand merchant of pearlsmi
queen and as a gift you shall have as much gold again as i have
promis for your gem
other king have desir as much and offer more but she is not for
you or ani of them answer asti look him in the face
now jane made a movement as though he would strike her then seem to
chang hi mind for he repli onli
a rough answer to a fair offer see that none know who you ar or
whenc you come but there ar ey upon us i will talk with you again
tomorrow till then rest in peac
it is useless began asti but he wa alreadi gone
present asti found tua in the garden and told her everyth
now i wish that kepher of the desert were at hand said tua nervous
for it seem that i am in a snare who like thi jane no better than
i did abi or the princ of kesh and will never be hi queen
then i think we had better fly to the wilder and seek him there
thi veri night for ladi you know what chanc to men who look upon
your loveli
i know what chanc to the princ of kesh and what will chanc to abi
at the hand of on i left behind me i can guess perhap thi jane
will fare no better still let us go
asti nod then by an afterthought went into the hous and ask some
question of the servant present she return and said
it is useless soldier ar alreadi station about the place and some
of our women who tri to go out have been turn back for thei sai
that by the king order none mai leav our door
now shall i strike upon the harp and call upon the name of kepher as
he bade me ask tua
i think not yet awhil ladi thi danger mai pass by or the night
bring counsel and then he would be angri if you summon him for
naught let us go in and eat
so thei went in and while thei sat at their food suddenli thei heard
a nois and look up perceiv by the light of the lamp that women
were crowd into the room led by two eunuch
tua drew a dagger from her robe and sprang up but the head eunuch an
old whitehair man bow low befor her and said
ladi you can kill me if you will for i am unarm but there ar mani
more of us without and to resist is useless hearken no harm shall be
done to you or to your companion but it is the king desir that on
so royal and beauti should be better lodg than in thi place
of traffic therefor he ha command me to take you and all your
household and all your good to no less a place than hi own palac
where he would speak with you
sheath the dagger and wast no word upon these slave daughter
said asti sinc we have no choic let us go
so after thei had veil and robe thei suffer themselv to be led
out and place in a doubl litter with their pearl and gold while the
king women collect all the rest of their good and took them awai
togeth with their servant leav the hous quit empti then
guard by soldier thei were born through the silent street till
thei came to great gate which close behind them and have pass up
mani stair the litter wa set down in a larg and beauti room lit
with silver lamp of scent oil here and in other room beyond
thei found women of the royal household and their own servant alreadi
arrang their possess
soon it wa done and food and wine have been set for them thei were
left alon in that room and stood look at each other
now shall i strike and call said tua lift the harp which she had
brought with her look yonder is a windowplac such as that of which
kepher spoke
not yet i think ladi let us learn all our case er we call for
help and as the word left her lip the door open and through it
clad in hi royal robe walk jane the king
now in the centr of thi great room wa a marbl basin fill with pure
water which perhap had serv as the bath of the queen who dwelt
there in former dai or perhap wa so design for the sake of
cool in time of heat tua and asti stood upon on side of thi
basin and to the other came the king so that the water lai between
them thrice he bow to tua then said
ladi who as your servant tell me ar known as nefert a maiden of
egypt and for lack of the true name doubtless thi will serv ladi
i come to ask your pardon for what must seem to you to be a grievou
wrong o ladi nefert thi must be my excus that i have no choic by
