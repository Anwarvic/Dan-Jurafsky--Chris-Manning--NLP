it and on the top of the gate pillar sat two stone lion which
were so hideou that i wa afraid of them perhap thi sentiment wa
prophet on could see the hous by peep through the bar of the
gate it wa a gloomylook place with a tall yew hedg round it
but in the summertim some flower grew about the sundial in the grass
plat thi hous wa call the hall and squir carson live there on

myself that my mother made of me in which thi peculiar is strongli
mark on thi occas of the christmastre i rememb that mr

at that moment the nurs came hurri in and whisper someth in hi
ear my father face turn deadli pale he clutch at the tabl to
support himself then stagger from the room my mother wa dy
it wa some dai afterward i do not know exactli how long that my
father took me by the hand and led me upstair into the big room which
had been my mother bedroom there she lai dead in her coffin with
flower in her hand along the wall of the room were arrang three
littl white bed and on each of the bed lai on of my brother thei
all look as though thei were asleep and thei all had flower in their
hand my father told me to kiss them becaus i should not see them ani

the lord hath given he said and the lord hath taken awai bless
be the name of the lord
i cri veri much and he took me downstair and after that i have onli
a confus memori of men dress in black carri heavi burden toward
the grei churchyard
next come a vision of a great ship and wide toss water my father
could no longer bear to live in england after the loss that had fallen
on him and made up hi mind to emigr to south africa we must have
been poor at the timeinde i believ that a larg portion of
our incom went from my father on my mother death at ani rate we
travel with the steerag passeng and the intens discomfort of
the journei with the rough wai of our fellow emigr still remain
upon my mind at last it came to an end and we reach africa which i
wa not to leav again for mani mani year
in those dai civil had not made ani great progress in southern
africa my father went up the countri and becam a missionari among the
kaffir near to where the town of cradock now stand and here i grew
to manhood there were a few boer farmer in the neighbourhood and
gradual a littl settlement of white gather round our mission
stationa drunken scotch blacksmith and wheelwright wa about the most
interest charact who when he wa sober could quot the scottish
poet burn and the ingoldsbi legend then recent publish liter
by the page it wa from that i contract a fond for the latter
amus write which ha never left me burn i never care for so
much probabl becaus of the scottish dialect which repel me what
littl educ i got wa from my father but i never had much lean
toward book nor he much time to teach them to me on the other hand
i wa alwai a keen observ of the wai of men and natur by the time
that i wa twenti i could speak dutch and three or four kaffir dialect
perfectli and i doubt if there wa anybodi in south africa who
understood nativ wai of thought and action more complet than i
did also i wa realli a veri good shot and horseman and i thinka
inde my subsequ career prove to have been the casea great deal
tougher than the major of men though i wa then as now light and
small noth seem to tire me i could bear ani amount of exposur
and privat and i never met the nativ who wa my master in feat
of endur of cours all that is differ now i am speak of my
earli manhood
it mai be wonder that i did not run absolut wild in such
surround but i wa held back from thi by my father societi he
wa on of the gentlest and most refin men that i ever met even the
most savag kaffir love him and hi influenc wa a veri good on
for me he us to call himself on of the world failur would that
there were more such failur everi morn when hi work wa done he
would take hi prayerbook and sit on the littl stoep or verandah
of our station would read the even psalm to himself sometim
there wa not light enough for thi but it made no differ he knew
them all by heart when he had finish he would look out across the
cultiv land where the mission kaffir had their hut
but i knew it wa not these he saw but rather the grei english church
and the grave rang side by side befor the yew near the wicket gate
it wa there on the stoep that he di he had not been well and on
even i wa talk to him and hi mind went back to oxfordshir and
my mother he spoke of her a good deal sai that she had never been
out of hi mind for a singl dai dure all these year and that he
rejoic to think he wa draw near that land wither she had gone
then he ask me if i rememb the night when squir carson came into
the studi at the vicarag and told him that hi wife had run awai and
that he wa go to chang hi name and buri himself in some remot
land
i answer that i rememb it perfectli
i wonder where he went to said my father and if he and hi daughter
stella ar still aliv well well i shall never meet them again but
life is a strang thing allan and you mai if you ever do give them
my kind love
after that i left him we had been suffer more than usual from the
depred of the kaffir thiev who stole our sheep at night and
as i had done befor and not without success i determin to watch the
kraal and see if i could catch them inde it wa from thi habit of
mine of watch at night that i first got my nativ name of macumazahn
which mai be roughli translat as he who sleep with on ey open so
i took my rifl and rose to go but he call me to him and kiss me on
the forehead sai god bless you allan i hope that you will think
of your old father sometim and that you will lead a good and happi
life
i rememb that i did not much like hi tone at the time but set it
down to an attack of low spirit to which he grew veri subject as the
year went on i went down to the kraal and watch till within an hour
of sunris then as no thiev appear return to the station as i
came near i wa astonish to see a figur sit in my father chair
at first i thought it must be a drunken kaffir then that my father had
fallen asleep there
and so he hadfor he wa dead
chapter ii
the firefight
when i had buri my father and seen a successor instal in hi
placefor the station wa the properti of the societyi set to work to
carri out a plan which i had long cherish but been unabl to execut
becaus it would have involv separ from my father put shortli
it wa to undertak a trade journei of explor right through the
countri now known as the free state and the transvaal and as much
further north as i could go it wa an adventur scheme for though
the emigr boer had begun to occupi posit in these territori
thei were still to all practic purpos unexplor but i wa now
alon in the world and it matter littl what becam of me so driven
on by the overmast love of adventur which old as i am will
perhap still be the caus of my death i determin to undertak the
journei
accordingli i sold such stock and good as we had upon the station
reserv onli the two best waggon and two span of oxen the proce
i invest in such good as were then in fashion for trade purpos
and in gun and ammunit the gun would have move ani modern
explor to merriment but such as thei were i manag to do a good deal
of execut with them on of them wa a singlebarrel smooth
bore fit for percuss capsa roer we call itwhich threw a
threeounc ball and wa charg with a hand of coars black powder
mani is the eleph that i kill with that roer although it gener
knock me backward when i fire it which i onli did under compuls
the best of the lot perhap wa a doublebarrel no 12 shotgun
but it had flint lock also there were some old tower musket which
might or might not throw straight at seventi yard i took six kaffir
with me and three good hors which were suppos to be saltedthat
is proof against the sick among the kaffir wa an old fellow
name indabazimbi which be translat mean tongu of iron
i suppos he got thi name from hi strident voic and exhaustless
eloqu thi man wa a great charact in hi wai he had been a
note witchdoctor among a neighbour tribe and came to the station
under the follow circumst which as he plai a consider
part in thi histori ar perhap worth record
two year befor my father death i had occas to search the countri
round for some lost oxen after a long and useless quest it occur
to me that i had better go to the place where the oxen were bred by a
kaffir chief whose name i forget but whose kraal wa about fifti mile
from our station there i journei and found the oxen safe at home
the chief entertain me handsom and on the follow morn i went
to pai my respect to him befor leav and wa somewhat surpris to
find a collect of some hundr of men and women sit round him
anxious watch the sky in which the thundercloud were bank up
in a veri omin wai
you had better wait white man said the chief and see the
raindoctor fight the lightn
i inquir what he meant and learn that thi man indabazimbi had
for some year occupi the posit of wizardinchief to the tribe
although he wa not a member of it have been born in the countri now
known as zululand but a son of the chief a man of about thirti
had late set up as a rival in supernatur power thi irrit
indabazimbi beyond measur and a quarrel ensu between the two
witchdoctor that result in a challeng to trial by lightn be
given and accept these were the condit the rival must await the
come of a seriou thunderstorm no ordinari tempest would serv their
turn then carri assegai in their hand thei must take their stand
within fifti pace of each other upon a certain patch of ground where
the big thunderbolt were observ to strike continu and by the
exercis of their occult power and invoc to the lightn must
strive to avert death from themselv and bring it on their rival the
term of thi singular match had been arrang a month previous
but no storm worthi of the occas had arisen now the local
weatherprophet believ it to be brew
i inquir what would happen if neither of the men were struck and wa
told that thei must then wait for anoth storm if thei escap the
second time howev thei would be held to be equal in power and be
jointli consult by the tribe upon occas of import
the prospect of be a spectat of so unusu a sight overcam my
desir to be gone and i accept the chief invit to see it
out befor middai i regret it for though the western heaven grew
darker and darker and the still air herald the come of the storm
yet it did not come by four oclock howev it becam obviou that
it must burst soonat sunset the old chief said and in the compani
of the whole assembl i move down to the place of combat the kraal wa
built on the top of a hill and below it the land slope gentli to the
bank of a river about half a mile awai on the hither side of the
bank wa the piec of land that wa the nativ said love of the
lightn here the magician took up their stand while the spectat
group themselv on the hillsid about two hundr yard awaywhich
wa i thought rather too near to be pleasant when we had sat there
for a while my curios overcam me and i ask leav of the chief to
go down and inspect the arena he said i might do so at my own risk i
told him that the fire from abov would not hurt white men and went
to find that the spot wa a bed of iron or thinli cover with grass
which of cours account for it attract the lightn from the
storm as thei travel along the line of the river at each end of
thi ironston area were place the combat indabazimbi face the
east and hi rival the west and befor each there burn a littl
fire made of some scent root moreov thei were dress in all the
paraphernalia of their craft snakeskin fishbladd and i know not
what besid while round their neck hung circlet of baboon teeth
and bone from human hand first i went to the western end where
the chief son stood he wa point with hi assegai toward the
advanc storm and invok it in a voic of great excit
come fire and lick up indabazimbi
hear me storm devil and lick indabazimbi with your red tongu
spit on him with your rain
whirl him awai in your breath
make him as nothingmelt the marrow in hi bone
run into hi heart and burn awai the li
show all the peopl who is the true witch finder
let me not be put to shame in the ey of thi white man
thu he spoke or rather chant and all the while rub hi broad
chestfor he wa a veri fine manwith some filthi compound of medicin
or mouti
after a while get tire of hi song i walk across the
ironston to where indabazimbi sat by hi fire he wa not chant
at all but hi perform wa much more impress it consist in
stare at the eastern sky which wa perfectli clear of cloud and
everi now and again beckon at it with hi finger then turn round
to point with the assegai toward hi rival for a while i look at him
in silenc he wa a curiou wizen man appar over fifti year
of ag with thin hand that look as tough as wire hi nose wa much
sharper than is usual among these race and he had a queer habit of
hold hi head sidewai like a bird when he spoke which in
addit to the humour that lurk in hi ey gave him a most comic
appear anoth strang thing about him wa that he had a singl
white lock of hair among hi black wool at last i spoke to him
indabazimbi my friend i said you mai be a good witchdoctor but
you ar certainli a fool it is no good beckon at the blue sky while
your enemi is get a start with the storm
you mai be clever but dont think you know everyth white man the
old fellow answer in a high crack voic and with someth like a
grin
thei call you irontongu i went on you had better us it or the
storm devil wont hear you
the fire from abov run down iron he answer so i keep my tongu
quiet oh ye let him curs awai ill put him out present look
now white man
i look and in the eastern sky there grew a cloud at first it wa
small though veri black but it gather with extraordinari rapid
thi wa odd enough but as i had seen the same thing happen befor it
did not particularli astonish me it is by no mean unusu in africa
for two thunderstorm to come up at the same time from differ point
of the compass
you had better get on indabazimbi i said the big storm is come
along fast and will soon eat up that babi of your and i point to
the west
babi sometim grow to giant white man said indabazimbi
beckon awai vigor look now at my cloudchild
i look the eastern storm wa spread itself from earth to sky and
in shape resembl an enorm man there wa it head it shoulder
and it leg ye it wa like a huge giant travel across the
heaven the light of the set sun escap from beneath the lower
edg of the western storm shot across the interven space in a sheet
of splendour and light upon the advanc figur of cloud wrap
it middl in hue of glori too wonder to be describ but beneath
and abov thi glow belt hi feet and head were black as jet
present as i watch an aw flash of light shot from the head of
the cloud circl it about as though with a crown of live fire and
vanish
aha chuckl old indabazimbi my littl boi is put on hi man
ring and he tap the gum ring on hi own head which nativ assum
when thei reach a certain ag and digniti now white man unless you
ar a bigger wizard than either of us you had better clear off for the
firefight is about to begin
i thought thi sound advic
good luck go with you my black uncl i said i hope you dont feel
the iniqu of a misspent life weigh on you at the last
you look after yourself and think of your own sin young man he
answer with a grim smile and take a pinch of snuff while at that
veri moment a flash of lightn i dont know from which storm struck
the ground within thirti pace of me that wa enough for me i took
to my heel and as i went i heard old indabazimbi dry chuckl of
amus
i climb the hill till i came to where the chief wa sit with hi
induna or headmen and sat down near to him i look at the man
face and saw that he wa intens anxiou for hi son safeti and
by no mean confid of the young man power to resist the magic of
indabazimbi he wa talk in a low voic to the induna next to him
i affect to take no notic and to be concentr my attent on
the novel scene befor me but in those dai i had veri quick ear and
caught the drift of the convers
hearken the chief wa sai if the magic of indabazimbi prevail
against my son i will endur him no more of thi i am sure that when
he ha slain my son he will slai me me also and make himself chief in
my place i fear indabazimbi ou
black on answer the induna wizard die as dog die and onc
dead dog bark no more
and onc dead said the chief wizard work no more spell and he
bent and whisper in the induna ear look at the assegai in hi
hand as he whisper
good my father good said the induna present it shall be done
tonight if the lightn doe not do it first
a bad lookout for old indabazimbi i said to myself thei mean to
kill him then i thought no more of the matter for a while the scene
befor me wa too tremend
the two storm were rapidli rush togeth between them wa a gulf of
blue sky and from time to time flash of blind light pass across
thi gulf leap from cloud to cloud i rememb that thei remind
me of the stori of the heathen god jove and hi thunderbolt the storm
that wa shape like a giant and ring with the glori of the sink
sun made an excel jove and i am sure that the bolt which leapt
from it could not have been surpass even in mytholog time
oddli enough as yet the flash were not follow by thunder a deadli
still lai upon the place the cattl stood silent on the hillsid
even the nativ were aw to silenc dark shadow crept along the
bosom of the hill the river to the right and left wa hidden in
wreath of cloud but befor us and beyond the combat it shone
like a line of silver beneath the narrow space of open sky now the
western tempest wa scrawl all over with line of intoler light
while the inki head of the cloudgiant to the east wa continu
suffus with a white and deadli glow that came and went in puls as
though a blood of flame wa be pump into it from the heart of the
storm
the silenc deepen and deepen the shadow grew blacker and blacker
then suddenli all natur began to moan beneath the breath of an ici
wind on sped the wind the smooth surfac of the river wa ruffl by
it into littl wave the tall grass bow low befor it and in it
wake came the hiss sound of furiou rain
ah the storm had met from each there burst an aw blaze of dazzl
flame and now the hill on which we sat rock at the nois of the
follow thunder the light went out of the sky dark fell suddenli
on the land but not for long present the whole landscap grew vivid
in the flash it appear and disappear now everyth wa visibl
for mile now even the men at my side vanish in the black the
thunder roll and crack and peal like the trump of doom whirlwind
tore round lift dust and even stone high into the air and in a
low continu underton rose the hiss of the rush rain
i put my hand befor my ey to shield them from the terribl glare
and look beneath it toward the list of ironston as flash follow
flash from time to time i caught sight of the two wizard thei were
slowli advanc toward on anoth each point at hi foe with the
assegai in hi hand i could see their everi movement and it seem to
me that the chain lightn wa strike the ironston all round them
suddenli the thunder and lightn ceas for a minut everyth grew
black and except for the rain silent
it is over on wai or the other chief i call out into the
dark
wait white man wait answer the chief in a voic thick with
anxieti and fear
hardli were the word out of hi mouth when the heaven were lit up
again till thei liter seem to flame there were the men not ten
pace apart a great flash fell between them i saw them stagger beneath
the shock indabazimbi recov himself firstat ani rate when the
next flash came he wa stand bolt upright point with hi assegai
toward hi enemi the chief son wa still on hi leg but he wa
stagger like a drunken man and the assegai had fallen from hi hand
dark then again a flash more fear if possibl than ani that
had gone befor to me it seem to come from the east right over the
head of indabazimbi at that instant i saw the chief son wrap
as it were in the heart of it then the thunder peal the rain burst
over us like a torrent and i saw no more
the worst of the storm wa done but for a while the dark wa so
dens that we could not move nor inde wa i inclin to leav the
safeti of the hillsid where the lightn wa never known to strike
and ventur down to the ironston occasion there still came
flash but search as we would we could see no trace of either of
the wizard for my part i believ that thei were both dead now the
cloud slowli roll awai down the cours of the river and with them
went the rain and now the star shone in their wake
let us go and see said the old chief rise and shake the water
from hi hair the firefight is end let us go and see who ha
conquer
i rose and follow him drip as though i had swum a hundr yard
with my cloth on and after me came all the peopl of the kraal
we reach the spot even in that light i could see where the ironston
had been split and fuse by the thunderbolt while i wa stare about
me i suddenli heard the chief who wa on my right give a low moan
and saw the peopl cluster round him i went up and look there on
the ground lai the bodi of hi son it wa a dread sight the hair
wa burnt off hi head the copper ring upon hi arm were fuse the
assegai handl which lai near wa liter shiver into thread and
when i took hold of hi arm it seem to me that everi bone of it wa
broken
the men with the chief stood gaze silent while the women wail
great is the magic of indabazimbi said a man at length the chief
turn and struck him a heavi blow with the kerri in hi hand
great or not thou dog he shall die he cri and so shalt thou if
thou singest hi prais so loudli
i said noth but think it probabl that indabazimbi had share
the fate of hi enemi i went to look but i could see noth of him
and at length be thoroughli chill with the wet start back to my
waggon to chang my cloth on reach it i wa rather surpris to
see a strang kaffir seat on the drivingbox wrap up in a blanket
hullo come out of that i said
the figur on the box slowli unrol the blanket and with great
deliber took a pinch of snuff
it wa a good firefight white man wa it not said indabazimbi
in hi high crack voic but he never had a chanc against me
poor boi he knew noth about it see white man what becom of
presumpt in the young it is sad veri sad but i made the flash
fly didnt i
you old humbug i said unless you ar care you will soon learn
what come of presumpt in the old for your chief is after you with
an assegai and it will take all your magic to dodg that
now you dont sai so said indabazimbi clamber off the waggon
with rapid and all becaus of thi wretch upstart there
gratitud for you white man i expos him and thei want to kill me
well thank you for the hint we shall meet again befor long and
he wa gone like a shot and not too soon for just then some of the
chief men came up to the waggon
on the follow morn i start homeward the first face i saw on
arriv at the station wa that of indabazimbi
how do you do macumazahn he said hold hi head on on side and
nod hi white lock i hear you ar christian here and i want to
try a new religion mine must be a bad on see that my peopl want
to kill me for expos an impostor
chapter iii
northward
i make no apolog to myself or to anybodi who mai happen to read thi
narr in futur for have set out the manner of my meet with
indabazimbi first becaus it wa curiou and secondli becaus he
take some hand in the subsequ event if that old man wa a
humbug he wa a veri clever on what amount of truth there wa in hi
pretens to supernatur power it is not for me to determin though
i mai have my own opinion on the subject but there wa no mistak as to
the extraordinari influenc he exercis over hi fellown also
he quit got round my poor father at first the old gentleman declin
to have him at the station for he had a great horror of these kaffir
wizard or witchfind but indabazimbi persuad him that he wa
anxiou to investig the truth of christian and challeng him to
a discuss the argument last two yearsto the time of my father
death inde at the conclus of each stage indabazimbi would
remark in the word of the roman governor almost prai white man
thou persuadest me to becom a christian but he never quit becam
oneinde i do not think he ever meant to it wa to him that my
father address hi letter to a nativ doubter thi work which
unfortun remain in manuscript is full of wise saw and learn
instanc it ought to be publish togeth with a prci of the
doubter answer which were verbal
so the talk went on if my father had live i believ it would be go
on now for both the disput were quit inexhaust meanwhil
indabazimbi wa allow to live on the station on condit that he
practis no witchcraft which my father firmli believ to be a wile of
the devil he said that he would not but for all that there wa never
an ox lost or a sudden death but he wa consult by those interest
when he had been with us a year a deput came to him from the tribe
he had left ask him to return thing had not gone well with them
sinc he went awai thei said and now the chief hi enemi wa
dead old indabazimbi listen to them till thei had done and as he
listen rake sand into a littl heap with hi toe then he spoke
point to the littl heap there is your tribe todai he said
then he lift hi heel and stamp the heap flat there is your tribe
befor three moon ar gone noth is left of it you drove me awai i
will have no more to do with you but when you ar be kill think of
my word
the messeng went three month afterward i heard that the whole
commun had been wipe out by an impi of raid pondo
when i wa at length readi to start upon my expedit i went to old
indabazimbi to sai goodby to him and wa rather surpris to find
him engag in roll up medicin assegai and other sundri in hi
blanket
goodby indabazimbi i said i am go to trek north
ye macumazahn he answer with hi head on on side and so am
ii want to see that countri we will go togeth
will we i said wait till you ar ask you old humbug
you had better ask me then macumazahn for if you dont you will
never come back aliv now that the old chief my father is gone to
where the storm come from and he nod to the sky i feel myself
get into bad habit again so last night i just threw up the bone
and work out about your journei and i can tell you thi that if you
dont take me you will die and what is more you will lose on who is
dearer to you than life in a strang fashion so just becaus you gave
me that hint a coupl of year ago i made up my mind to come with you
dont talk stuff to me i said
ah veri well macumazahn veri well but what happen to my own
peopl six month ago and what did i tell the messeng would happen
thei drove me awai and thei ar gone if you drive me awai you will
soon be gone too and he nod hi white lock at me and smile now
i wa not more superstiti than other peopl but somehow old
indabazimbi impress me also i knew hi extraordinari influenc over
everi class of nativ and bethought me that he might be us in that
wai
all right i said i appoint you witchfind to the expedit
without pai
first serv then ask for wage he answer i am glad to see that
you have enough imagin not to be altogeth a fool like most white
men macumazahn ye ye it is want of imagin that make
peopl fool thei wont believ what thei cant understand you cant
understand my propheci ani more than the fool at the kraal could
understand that i wa hi master with the lightn well it is time to
trek but if i were you macumazahn i should take on waggon not two
why i said
becaus you will lose your waggon and it is better to lose on than
two
oh nonsens i said
all right macumazahn live and learn and without anoth word he
walk to the foremost waggon put hi bundl into it and climb on to
the front seat
so have bid an affection adieu to my white friend includ the
old scotchman who got drunk in honour of the event and quot burn
till the tear ran down hi face at length i start and travel
slowli northward for the first three week noth veri particular
befel me such kaffir as we came in contact with were friendli and
game liter swarm nobodi live in those part of south africa
nowadai can have the remotest idea of what the veldt wa like even
thirti year ago
often and often i have crept shiver on to my waggonbox just as the
sun rose and look out at first on would see noth but a vast field
of white mist suffus toward the east by a tremul golden glow
through which the top of stoni koppi stood up like gigant beacon
from the dens mist would come strang soundssnort grunt
bellow and the thunder of countless hoof present thi great
curtain would grow thinner then it would melt as the smoke from a
pipe melt into the air and for mile on mile the wide roll countri
interspers with bush open to the view but it wa not tenantless as
it is now for as far as the ey could reach it would be liter black
with game here to the right might be a herd of vilderbeest that could
not number less than two thousand some were graze some gambol
whisk their white tail into the air while all round the old bull
stood upon hillock snif suspici at the breez there in
front a hundr yard awai though to the unpractis ey thei look
much closer becaus of the dazzl clear of the atmospher wa
a great herd of springbok trek along in singl file ah thei have
come to the waggontrack and do not like the look of it what will thei
dogo back not a bit of it it is nearli thirti feet wide but that
is noth to a springbok see the first of them bound into the air
like a ball how beautifulli the sunshin gleam upon hi golden
hide he ha clear it and the other come after him in numberless
success all except the fawn who cannot jump so far and have to
scamper over the doubt path with a terrifi bah what is that
yonder move abov the top of the mimosa in the littl dell at the
foot of the koppi giraff by georg three of them there will be
marrowbon for supper tonight hark the ground shake behind us and
over the brow of the rise rush a vast herd of blesbock on thei come at
full gallop their long head held low thei look like so mani beard
goat i thought sobehind them is a pack of wild dog their fur
draggl their tongu loll thei ar in full cry the giraff hear
them and ar awai roll round the koppi like a ship in a heavi sea
no marrowbon after all see the foremost dog ar close on a buck
he ha gallop far and is outworn on spring at hi flank and miss
him the buck give a kind of groan look wildli round and see the
waggon he seem to hesit a moment then in hi despair rush up
to it and fall exhaust among the oxen the dog pull up some thirti
pace awai pant and snarl now boi the gunno not the rifl
the shotgun load with looper
bang bang there my friend two of you will never hunt buck again
no dont touch the buck for he ha come to us for shelter and he
shall have it
ah how beauti is natur befor man come to spoil it
such a sight as thi have i seen mani a hundr time and i hope to see
it again befor i die
the first real adventur that befel me on thi particular journei wa
with eleph which i will relat becaus of it curiou termin
just befor we cross the orang river we came to a stretch of
forestland some twenti mile broad the night we enter thi forest
we camp in a love open glade a few yard ahead tambouki grass wa
grow to the height of a man or rather it had been now with the
except of a few stalk here and there it wa crush quit flat it
wa alreadi dusk when we camp but after the moon got up i walk from
the fire to see how thi had happen on glanc wa enough for me
a great herd of eleph had evid pass over the tall grass not
mani hour befor the sight of their spoor rejoic me exceedingli
for though i had seen wild eleph at that time i had never shot
on moreov the sight of eleph spoor to the african hunter is what
colour in the pan is to the prospector of gold it is by the ivori
that he live and to shoot it or trade it is hi chief aim in life my
resolut wa soon taken i would camp the waggon for a while in the
forest and start on horseback after the eleph
i commun my decis to indabazimbi and the other kaffir the
latter were not loth for your kaffir love hunt which mean plenti
of meat and congeni occup but indabazimbi would express no
opinion i saw him retir to a littl fire that he had lit for himself
and go through some mysteri perform with bone and clai mix
with ash which were watch with the greatest interest by the other
kaffir at length he rose and come forward inform me that it wa
all right and that i did well to go and hunt the eleph as i should
get plenti of ivori but he advis me to go on foot i said i should
do noth of the sort but meant to ride i am wiser now thi wa
the first and last time that i ever attempt to hunt eleph on
horseback
accordingli we start at dawn i indabazimbi and three men the rest
i left with the waggon i wa on horseback and so wa my driver a
good rider and a skil shot for a kaffir but indabazimbi and the
other walk from dawn till middai we follow the trail of the herd
which wa as plain as a high road then we offsaddl to let the hors
rest and feed and about three oclock start on again anoth hour or
so pass and still there wa no sign of eleph evid the herd
had travel fast and far and i began to think that we should have to
give it up when suddenli i caught sight of a brown mass move through
the thorntre on the side of a slope about a quarter of a mile awai
my heart seem to jump into my mouth where is the hunter who ha not
felt like thi at the sight of hi first eleph
i call a halt and then the wind be right we set to work to stalk
the bull veri quietli i rode down the hither side of the slope till we
came to the bottom which wa dens cover with bush here i saw the
eleph had been feed for broken branch and upturn tree lai
all about i did not take much notic howev for all my thought
were fix upon the bull i wa stalk when suddenli my hors gave
a violent start that nearli threw me from the saddl and there came a
mighti rush and upheav of someth in front of me i look there
wa the hinder part of a second bull eleph not four yard off i
could just catch sight of it outstretch ear project on either
side i had disturb it sleep and it wa run awai
obvious the best thing to do would have been to let it run but i wa
young in those dai and foolish and in the excit of the moment i
lift my roer or eleph gun and fire at the great brute over my
hors head the recoil of the heavi gun nearli knock me off the
hors i recov myself howev and as i did so saw the bull
lurch forward for the impact of a threeounc bullet in the flank will
quicken the movement even of an eleph by thi time i had realiz
the folli of the shot and devoutli hope that the bull would take
no further notic of it but he took a differ view of the matter
pull himself up in a seri of plung he spun round and came for
me with outstretch ear and uplift trunk scream terribl i wa
quit defenceless for my gun wa empti and my first thought wa of
escap i dug my heel into the side of my hors but he would not move
an inch the poor anim wa paralyz with terror and he simpli stood
still hi foreleg outstretch and quiver all over like a leaf
on rush the eleph aw to see i made on more vain effort to
stir the hors now the trunk of the great bull swung aloft abov my
head a thought flash through my brain quick as light i roll from
the saddl by the side of the hors lai a fallen tree as thick through
as a man bodi the tree wa lift a littl off the ground by the
broken bough which took it weight and with a singl movement so
activ is on in such necess i flung myself beneath it as i did
so i heard the trunk of the eleph descend with a mighti thud on the
back of my poor hors and the next instant i wa almost in dark
for the hors whose back wa broken fell over across the tree under
which i lai ensconc but he did not stop there long in ten second
more the bull had wound hi trunk about my dead nag neck and with a
mighti effort hurl him clear of the tree i wriggl backward as far
as i could toward the root of the tree for i knew what he wa after
present i saw the red tip of the bull trunk stretch itself
toward me if he could manag to hook it round ani part of me i wa
lost but in the posit i occupi that wa just what he could not
do although he knelt down to facilit hi oper on came the
snap tip like a great openmouth snake it close upon my hat
which vanish again it wa thrust down and a scream of rage wa
bellow through it within four inch of my head now it seem to
elong itself oh heaven now it had me by the hair which luckili
for myself wa not veri long then it wa my turn to scream for next
instant half a squar inch of hair wa drag from my scalp by the
root i wa be pluck aliv as i have seen cruel kaffir kitchen
boi pluck a fowl
the eleph howev disappoint with these moder result chang
hi tactic he wound hi trunk round the fallen tree and lift the
tree stir but fortun the broken branch embed in the spongi
soil and some root which still held prevent it from be turn
over though he lift it so much that had it occur to him he could
now easili have drawn me out with hi trunk again he hoist with all
hi mighti strength and i saw that the tree wa come and roar
aloud for help some shot were fire close by in answer but if thei
hit the bull their onli effect wa to stir hi energi to more activ
life in anoth few second my shelter would be torn awai and i should
be done for a cold perspir burst out over me as i realiz that i
wa lost then of a sudden i rememb that i had a pistol in my belt
which i often us for despatch wound game it wa load and
cap by thi time the tree wa lift so much that i could easili get
my hand down to my middl and draw the pistol from it case i drew and
cock it now the tree wa come over and there within three feet of
my head wa the great brown trunk of the eleph i place the
muzzl of the pistol within an inch of it and fire the result wa
instantan down sunk the tree again give on of my leg a
consider squeez and next instant i heard a crash sound the
eleph had bolt
by thi time what between fright and struggl i wa pretti well
tire i cannot rememb how i got from under the fallen tree or inde
anyth until i found myself sit on the ground drink some peach
brandi from a flask and old indabazimbi opposit to me nod
hi white lock sage while he fire off moral reflect on the
narrow of my escap and my unwisdom in not have taken hi advic
to go on foot that remind me of my horsei got up and went to look
at it it wa quit dead the blow of the eleph trunk had fallen
on the saddl break the framework and render it useless i
reflect that in anoth two second it would have fallen on me then
i call to indabazimbi and ask which wai the eleph had gone
there he said point down the gulli and we had better go after
them macumazahn we have had the bad luck now for the good
there wa philosophi in thi though to tell the truth i did not feel
particularli sharp set on eleph at the moment i seem to have had
enough of them howev it would never do to show the white feather
befor the boi so i assent with much outward readi and we
start i on the second hors and the other on foot when we had
travel for the best part of an hour down the vallei all of a sudden
we came upon the whole herd which number a littl more than eighti
just in front of them the bush wa so thick that thei seem to hesit
about enter it and the side of the vallei were so rocki and steep
at thi point that thei could not climb them
thei saw us at the same moment as we saw them and inwardli i wa fill
with fear lest thei should take it into their head to charg back up
the gulli but thei did not trumpet aloud thei rush at the thick
bush which went down befor them like corn befor a sickl i do not
think that in all my experi i ever heard anyth to equal the
sound thei made as thei crash through and over the shrub and tree
befor them wa a dens forest belt from a hundr to a hundr and
fifti feet in width as thei rush on it fell so that behind them
wa noth but a level roadwai strew with fallen trunk crush
branch and here and there a tree too strong even for them left
strand amid the wreck on thei went and notwithstand the natur
of the ground over which thei had to travel thei kept their distanc
ahead of us thi sort of thing continu for a mile or more and then
i saw that in front of the eleph the vallei open into a space
cover with reed and grassit might have been five or six acr in
extentbeyond which the vallei ran on again
the herd reach the edg of thi expans and for a moment pull up
hesitatingevid thei mistrust it my men yell aloud as onli
kaffir can and that settl them head by the wound bull whose
martial ardour like my own wa somewhat cool thei spread out and
dash into the treacher swampfor such it wa though just then
there wa no water to be seen for a few yard all went well with them
though thei clearli found it heavi go then suddenli the great bull
sank up to hi belli in the stiff peati soil and remain fix the
other mad with fear took no heed of hi struggl and trumpet
but plung on to meet the same fate in five minut the whole herd of
them were hopelessli bog and the more thei struggl to escap the
deeper thei sunk there wa on except inde a cow manag to win
back to firm shore and lift her trunk prepar to charg us as we
came up but at that moment she heard the scream of her calf and rush
back to it assist onli to be bog with the other
such a scene i never saw befor or sinc the swamp wa spot all
over with the larg form of the eleph and the air rang with their
scream of rage and terror as thei wave their trunk wildli to and fro
now and then a monster would make a great effort and drag hi mass from
it peati bed onli to stick fast again at the next step it wa a most
pitiabl sight though on that gladden the heart of my men even the
best nativ have littl compass for the suffer of anim
well the rest wa easi the marsh that would not bear the eleph
carri our weight well enough befor midnight all were dead for we
shot them by moonlight i would gladli have spare the young on and
some of the cow but to do so would onli have meant leav them to
perish of hunger it wa kinder to kill them at onc the wound bull i
slew with my own hand and i cannot sai that i felt much compunct in
so do he knew me again and made a desper effort to get at me
but i am glad to sai that the peat held him fast
the pan present a curiou sight when the sun rose next morn ow
to the support given by the soil few of the dead eleph had fallen
there thei stood as though thei were asleep
i sent back for the waggon and when thei arriv on the morrow form
a camp about a mile awai from the pan then began the work of cut
out the eleph tusk it took over a week and for obviou reason
wa a disgust task inde had it not been for the help of some
wander bushmen who took their pai in eleph meat i do not think
we could ever have manag it
at last it wa done the ivori wa far too cumbersom for us to carri
so we buri it have first got rid of our bushmen alli my boi
want me to go back to the cape with it and sell it but i wa too much
bent on my journei to do thi the tusk lai buri for five year then
i came and dug them up thei were but littl harm ultim i sold
the ivori for someth over twelv hundr poundsnot bad pai for on
dai shoot
thi wa how i began my career as an eleph hunter i have shot mani
hundr of them sinc but have never again attempt to do so on
horseback
chapter iv
the zulu impi
after buri the eleph tusk and have taken care note of the
bear and peculiar of the countri so that i might be abl to
find the spot again we proceed on our journei for a month or more
i trek along the line which now divid the orang free state
from griqualand west and the transvaal from bechuanaland the
onli difficulti met with were such as ar still common to african
travellersoccasion want of water and troubl about cross sluit
and river i rememb that i outspan on the spot where kimberlei now
stand and had to press on again in a hurri becaus there wa no water
i littl dream then that i should live to see kimberlei a great
citi produc million of pound worth of diamond annual and old
indabazimbi magic cannot have been worth so much after all or he
would have told me
i found the countri almost entir depopul not veri long befor
mosilikatz the lion chaka gener had swept across it in hi
progress toward what is now matabeleland hi footstep were evid
enough time upon time i trek up to what had evid been the site
of kaffir kraal now the kraal were ash and pile of tumbl stone
and strewn about among the rank grass were the bone of hundr of men
women and children all of whom had kiss the zulu assegai i rememb
that in on of these desol place i found the skull of a child in
which a groundlark had built it nest it wa the twitter of the
young bird insid that first call my attent to it shortli after
thi we met with our second great adventur a much more seriou and
tragic on than the first
we were trek parallel with the kolong river when a herd of blesbock
cross the track i fire at on of them and hit it behind it gallop
about a hundr yard with the rest of the herd then lai down as we
were in want of meat not have met with ani game for a few dai past
i jump on to my hors and tell indabazimbi that i would overtak
the waggon or meet them on the further side of a rise about an hour
trek awai i start after the wound buck as soon as i came within
a hundr yard of it howev it jump up and ran awai as fast
as though it were untouch onli to lie down again at a distanc i
follow think that strength would soon fail it thi happen three
time on the third occas it vanish behind a ridg and though
by now i wa out of both temper and patienc i thought i might as well
ride to the crest and see if i could get a shot at it on the further
side
i reach the ridg which wa strewn with stone look over it and
sawa zulu impi
i rub my ey and look again ye there wa no doubt of it thei
were halt about a thousand yard awai by the water some were ly
down some were cook at fire other were stalk about with spear
and shield in their hand there might have been two thousand or
more of them in all while i wa wonderingand that with no littl
uneasinesswhat on earth thei could be do there suddenli i heard a
wild cry to the right and left of me i glanc first on wai then the
other from either side a great zulu wa bear down on me their broad
stab assegai aloft and black shield in their left hand the man
to the right wa about fifteen yard awai he to the left wa not more
than ten on thei came their fierc ey almost start out of their
head and i felt with a cold thrill of fear that in anoth three
second those broad bangwan might be buri in my vital on such
occas we act i suppos more from instinct than from anyth
elsether is no time for thought at ani rate i drop the rein
and rais my gun fire point blank at the lefthand man the bullet
struck him in the middl of hi shield pierc it and pass through
him and over he roll upon the veldt i swung round in the saddl
most happili my hors wa accustom to stand still when i fire from
hi back also he wa so surpris that he did not know which wai to
shy the other savag wa almost on me hi outstretch shield reach
the muzzl of my gun as i pull the trigger of the left barrel it
explod the warrior sprung high into the air and fell against my
hors dead hi spear pass just in front of my face
without wait to reload or even to look if the main bodi of the zulu
had seen the death of their two scout i turn my hors and drove
my heel into hi side as soon as i wa down the slope of the rise i
pull a littl to the right in order to intercept the waggon befor
the zulu saw them i had not gone three hundr yard in thi new
direct when to my utter astonish i struck a trail mark with
waggonwheel and the hoof of oxen of waggon there must have been
at least eight and sever hundr cattl moreov thei had pass
within twelv hour i could tell that by the spoor then i understood
the impi wa follow the track of the waggon which in all
probabl belong to a parti of emigr boer
the spoor of the waggon ran in the direct i wish to go so i
follow it about a mile further on i came to the crest of a rise and
there about five furlong awai i saw the waggon drawn up in a rough
laager upon the bank of the river there too were my own waggon
trek down the slope toward them
in anoth five minut i wa there the boersfor boer thei
werewer stand about outsid the littl laager watch the
approach of my two waggon i call to them and thei turn and saw
me the veri first man my ey fell on wa a boer name han botha whom
i had known well year ago in the cape he wa not a bad specimen of hi
class but a veri restless person with a great object to author
or as he express it a love of freedom he had join a parti of
the emigr boer some year befor but as i learn present
had quarrel with it leader and wa now trek awai into the
wilder to found a littl coloni of hi own poor fellow it wa hi
last trek
how do you do meinheer botha i said to him in dutch
the man look at me look again then startl out of hi dutch
stolid cri to hi wife who wa seat on the box of the waggon
come here frau come here is allan quatermain the englishman the
son of the predic how goe it heer quatermain and what is the
new down in the cape yonder
i dont know what the new is in the cape han i answer solemnli
but the new here is that there is a zulu impi upon your spoor and
within two mile of the waggon that i know for i have just shot two
of their sentri and i show him my empti gun
for a moment there wa a silenc of astonish and i saw the bronz
face of the men turn pale beneath their tan while on or two of the
women gave a littl scream and the children crept to their side
almighti cri han that must be the umtetwa regiment that dingaan
sent against the basutu but who could not come at them becaus of the
marsh and so were afraid to return to zululand and struck north to
join mosilikatz
laager up carl laager up for your live and on of you jump on a
hors and drive in the cattl
at thi moment my own waggon came up indabazimbi wa sit on the
box of the first wrap in a blanket i call him and told him the
new
ill tide macumazahn he said there will be dead boer about
tomorrow morn but thei will not attack till dawn then thei will
wipe out the laager so and he pass hi hand befor hi mouth
stop that croak you whitehead crow i said though i knew
hi word were true what chanc had a laager of ten waggon all told
against at least two thousand of the bravest savag in the world
macumazahn will you take my advic thi time indabazimbi said
present
what is it i ask
thi leav your waggon here jump on that hors and let us two run
for it as hard as we can go the zulu wont follow us thei will be
look after the boer
i wont leav the other white men i said it would be the act of a
coward if i die i die
veri well macumazahn then stai and be kill he answer take
a pinch of snuff come let us see about the waggon and we walk
toward the laager
here everyth wa in confus howev i got hold of han botha and
put it to him if it would not be best to desert the waggon and make a
run for it
how can we do it he answer two of the women ar too fat to go
a mile on is sick in childb and we have onli six hors among us
besid if we did we should starv in the desert no heer allan we
must fight it out with the savag and god help us
god help us inde think of the children han
i cant bear to think he answer in a broken voic look at hi
own littl girl a sweet curlyhair blueei child of six name
tota whom i had often nurs as a babi oh heer allan your father
the predic alwai warn me against trek north and i never
would listen to him becaus i thought him a curs englishman now i see
my folli heer allan if you can try to save my child from those black
devil if you live longer than i do or if you cant save her kill
her and he clasp my hand
it hasnt come to that yet han i said
then we set to work on the laager the waggon of which includ
my two there were ten were drawn into the form of a squar and the
disselboom of each secur lash with reim to the underwork of that
in front of it the wheel also were lock and the space between the
ground and the bedplank of the waggon wa stuf with branch
of the waitabit thorn that fortun grew near in consider
quantiti in thi wai a barrier wa form of no mean strength as
against a foe unprovid with firearm place be left for the men
to fire from in a littl over an hour everyth wa done that could be
done and a discuss aros as to the dispos of the cattl which had
been driven up close to the camp some of the boer were anxiou to get
them into the laager small as it wa or at least as mani of them as it
would hold i argu strongli against thi point out that the brute
would probabl be seiz with panic as soon as the fire began and
trampl the defend of the laager under foot as an altern plan
i suggest that some of the nativ servant should drive the herd along
the vallei of the river till thei reach a friendli tribe or some other
place of safeti of cours if the zulu saw them thei would be taken
but the natur of the ground wa favour and it wa possibl that
thei might escap if thei start at onc the proposit wa promptli
agre to and what is more it wa settl that on dutchman and such
of the women and children as could travel should go with them in half
an hour time twelv of them start with the nativ the boer in
charg and the cattl three of my own men went with the latter the
three other and indabazimbi stop with me in the laager
the part wa a heartbreak scene upon which i do not care to
dwell the women wept the men groan and the children look on with
scare white face at length thei were gone and i for on wa thank
of it there remain in the laager seventeen white men four nativ
the two boer frau who were too stout to travel the woman in childb
and her babi and han bother littl daughter tota whom he could not
make up hi mind to part with happili her mother wa alreadi dead and
here i mai state that ten of the women and children togeth with about
half of the cattl escap the zulu impi never saw them and on the
third dai of travel thei came to the fortifi place of a griqua chief
who shelter them on receiv half the cattl in payment thenc
by slow degre thei journei down to the cape coloni reach a
civil region within a littl more than a year from the date of the
attack on the laager
the afternoon wa now draw toward even but still there were no
sign of the impi a wild hope struck us that thei might have gone
on about their busi ever sinc indabazimbi had heard that the
regiment wa suppos to belong to the umtetwa tribe he had i notic
been plung in deep thought present he came to me and volunt
to go out and spy upon their movement at first han botha wa against
thi idea sai that he wa a verdomd swartzelan accurs black
creatureand would betrai us i point out that there wa noth to
betrai the zulu must know where the waggon were but it wa import
for us to gain inform of their movement so it wa agre that
indabazimbi should go i told him thi he nod hi white lock said
all right macumazahn and start i notic with some surpris
howev that befor he did so he went to the waggon and fetch hi
mouti or medicin which togeth with hi other magic apparatu
he alwai carri in a skin bag i ask him why he did thi he
answer that it wa to make himself invulner against the spear
of the zulu i did not in the least believ hi explan for in my
heart i wa sure that he meant to take the opportun to make a bolt
of it leav me to my fate i did not howev interfer to prevent
thi for i had an affect for the old fellow and sincer hope
that he might escap the doom which overshadow us
so indabazimbi saunter off and as i look at hi retreat form i
thought i should never see it again but i wa mistaken and littl knew
that he wa risk hi life not for the boer whom he hate on and
all but for me whom in hi queer wai he love
when he had gone we complet our prepar for defenc
strengthen the waggon and the thorn beneath with earth and stone
then at sunset we at and drank as heartili as we could under the
circumst and when we had done han botha as head of the parti
offer up prayer to god for our preserv it wa a touch sight
to see the burli dutchman hi hat off hi broad face lit up by the
last rai of the set sun prai aloud in home simpl languag
to him who alon could save us from the spear of a cruel foe i
rememb that the last sentenc of hi prayer wa almighti if we must
be kill save the women and children and my littl girl tota from the
accurs zulu and do not let us be tortur
i echo the request veri earnestli in my own heart that i know for in
common with the other i wa dreadfulli afraid and it must be admit
not without reason
then the dark came on and we took up our appoint place each
with a rifl in hi hand and peer out into the gloom in silenc
occasion on of the boer would light hi pipe with a brand from the
smoulder fire and the glow of it would shine for a few moment on
hi pale anxiou face
behind me on of the stout frau lai upon the ground even the terror
of our posit could not keep her heavi ey from their accustom
sleep and she snore loudli on the further side of her just by the
fire lai littl tota wrap in a kaross she wa asleep also her
thumb in her mouth and from time to time her father would come to look
at her
so the hour wore on while we wait for the zulu but from my intim
knowledg of the habit of nativ i had littl fear that thei would
attack us at night though had thei done so thei could have compass
our destruct with but small loss to themselv it is not the habit
of thi peopl thei like to fight in the light of dayat dawn for
prefer
about eleven oclock just as i wa nod a littl at my post i heard
a low whistl outsid the laager instantli i wa wide awak and all
along the line i heard the click of lock as the boer cock their
gun
macumazahn said a voic the voic of indabazimbi ar you there
ye i answer
then hold a light so that i can see how to climb into the laager he
said
yah yah hold a light put in on of the boer i dont trust
that black schepsel of your heer quatermain he mai have some of
hi countrymen with him accordingli a lantern wa produc and held
toward the voic there wa indabazimbi alon we let him into the
laager and ask him the new
thi is the new white men he said i wait till dark and
creep up to the place where the zulu ar encamp hid myself behind
a stone and listen thei ar a great regiment of umtetwa as baa
botha yonder thought thei struck the spoor of the waggon three dai
ago and follow it tonight thei sleep upon their spear tomorrow at
daybreak thei will attack the laager and kill everybodi thei ar veri
bitter against the boer becaus of the battl at blood river and the
other fight and that is why thei follow the waggon instead of go
straight north after mosilikatz
a kind of groan went up from the group of listen dutchmen
i tell you what it is heeren i said instead of wait to be
butcher here like buck in a pitfal let us go out now and fall upon
the impi while it sleep
thi proposit excit some discuss but in the end onli on man
could be found to vote for it boer as a rule lack that dash which
make great soldier such forlorn hope ar not in their line and
rather than embark upon them thei prefer to take their chanc in a
laager howev poor that chanc mai be for my own part i firmli
believ that had my advic been taken we should have rout the zulu
seventeen desper white men arm with gun would have produc no
small effect upon a camp of sleep savag but it wa not taken so
it is no us talk about it
after that we went back to our post and slowli the weari night wore
on toward the dawn onli those who have watch under similar
circumst while thei wait the advent of almost certain and cruel
death can know the tortur suspens of those heavi hour but thei
went somehow and at last in the far east the sky began to lighten
while the cold breath of dawn stir the tilt of the waggon and
chill me to the bone the fat dutchwoman behind me woke with a yawn
then rememb all moan aloud while her teeth chatter with
cold and fear han botha went to hi waggon and got a bottl of peach
brandi from which he pour into a tin pannikin give us each a stiff
dram and make attempt to be cheer as he did so but hi affect
jocular onli seem to depress hi comrad the more certainli it
depress me
now the light wa grow and we could see some wai into the mist which
still hung dens over the river and nowah there it wa from the
other side of the hill a thousand yard or more from the laager came
a faint hum sound it grew and grew till it gather to a chantth
aw war chant of the zulu soon i could catch the word thei were
simpl enough
we shall slai we shall slai is it not so my brother our spear
shall blush bloodr is it not so my brother for we ar the
suckl of chaka blood is our milk my brother awak children
of the umtetwa awak the vultur wheel the jackal sniff the air
awak children of the umtetwacri aloud ye ring men there is
the foe we shall slai them is it not so my brother sgee sgee
sgee
such is a rough translat of that hate chant which to thi veri dai
i often seem to hear it doe not look particularli impos on paper
but if while he wait to be kill the reader could have heard it
as it roll through the still air from the throat of nearli three
thousand warrior sing all to time he would have found it impress
enough
now the shield began to appear over the brow of the rise thei came
by compani each compani about nineti strong altogeth there were
thirtyon compani i count them when all were over thei form
themselv into a tripl line then trot down the slope toward us
at a distanc of a hundr and fifti yard or just out of the shot of
such gun as we had in those dai thei halt and began sing again
yonder is the kraal of the white mana littl kraal my
brother
we shall eat it up we shall trampl it flat my brother
but where ar the white man cattlewher ar hi oxen my
brother
thi question seem to puzzl them a good deal for thei sang the song
again and again at last a herald came forward a great man with ivori
ring about hi arm and put hi hand to hi mouth call out to
us ask where our cattl were
han botha climb on to the top of a waggon and roar out that thei
might answer that question themselv
then the herald call again sai that he saw the cattl had been
sent awai
we shall go and find the cattl he said then we shall come and kill
you becaus without cattl you must stop where you ar but if we wait
to kill you befor we get the cattl thei mai have trek too far for
us to follow and if you try to run awai we shall easili catch you white
men
thi struck me as a veri odd speech for the zulu gener attack an
enemi first and take hi cattl afterward still there wa a certain
amount of plausibl about it while i wa still wonder what it
all might mean the zulu began to run past us in compani toward the
river suddenli a shout announc that thei had found the spoor of the
cattl and the whole impi of them start down it at a run till thei
vanish over a rise about a quarter of a mile awai
we wait for half an hour or more but noth could we see of them
now i wonder if the devil have realli gone said han botha to me
it is veri strang
i will go and see said indabazimbi if you will come with me
macumazahn we can creep to the top of the ridg and look over
at first i hesit but curios overcam me i wa young in those
dai and weari with suspens
veri well i said we will go
so we start i had my eleph gun and ammunit indabazimbi had
hi medicin bag and an assegai we crept to the top of the rise like
sportsmen stalk a buck the slope on the other side wa strewn with
rock among which grew bush and tall grass
thei must have gone down the donga i said to indabazimbi i cant
see on of them
as i spoke there came a roar of men all round me from everi rock from
everi tuft of grass rose a zulu warrior befor i could turn befor i
could lift a gun i wa seiz and thrown
hold him hold the white spirit fast cri a voic hold him or
he will slip awai like a snake dont hurt him but hold him fast let
indabazimbi walk by hi side
i turn on indabazimbi you black devil you have betrai me i
cri
wait and see macumazahn he answer coolli now the fight is go
to begin
chapter v
the end of the laager
i gasp with wonder and rage what did that scoundrel indabazimbi
mean why had i been drawn out of the laager and seiz and why be
seiz wa i not instantli kill thei call me the white spirit
could it be that thei were keep me to make me into medicin i had
heard of such thing be done by zulu and kindr tribe and my
blood ran cold at the thought what an end to be pound up made
medicin of and eaten
howev i had littl time for further reflect for now the whole
impi wa pour back from the donga and riverbank where it had hidden
while their ruse wa carri out and onc more form up on the side
of the slope i wa taken to the crest of the slope and place in the
centr of the reserv line in the especi charg of a huge zulu name
bombyan the same man who had come forward as a herald thi brute
seem to regard me with an affection curios now and again he
poke me in the rib with the handl of hi assegai as though to assur
himself that i wa solid and sever time he ask me to be so good
as to prophesi how mani zulu would be kill befor the amaboona as
thei call the boer were eaten up
at first i took no notic of him beyond scowl but present goad
into anger i prophesi that he would be dead in an hour
he onli laugh aloud oh white spirit he said is it so well
iv walk a long wai from zululand and shall be glad of a rest
and he got it shortli as will be seen
now the zulu began to sing again
we have caught the white spirit my brother my brother
irontongu whisper of him he smelt him out my brother
now the maboona ar oursthei ar alreadi dead my brother
so that treacher villain indabazimbi had betrai me suddenli the
chief of the impi a greyhair man name sususa held up hi assegai
and instantli there wa silenc then he spoke to some induna who stood
near him instantli thei ran to the right and left down the first
line sai a word to the captain of each compani as thei pass
him present thei were at the respect end of the line and
simultan held up their spear as thei did so with an aw
roar of bulala amaboonaslai the boer the entir line number
nearli a thousand men bound forward like a buck startl from it
form and rush down upon the littl laager it wa a splendid sight
to see them their assegai glitter in the sunlight as thei rose and
fell abov their black shield their warplum bend back upon the
wind and their fierc face set intent on the foe while the solid
earth shook beneath the thunder of their rush feet i thought of my
poor friend the dutchmen and trembl what chanc had thei against so
mani
now the zulu run in the shape of a bow so as to wrap the laager
round on three side were within seventi yard and now from everi
waggon broke tongu of fire over roll a number of the umtetwa
but the rest care littl forward thei sped straight to the laager
strive to forc a wai in but the boer pli them with vollei after
vollei and pack as the zulu were the eleph gun load with
slug and small shot did fright execut onli on man even got on
to a waggon and as he did so i saw a boer woman strike him on the head
with an ax he fell down and slowli amid howl of deris from the
two line on the hillsid the zulu drew back
let us go father shout the soldier on the slope among whom i
wa to their chief who had come up you have sent out the littl
girl to fight and thei ar frighten let us show them the wai
no no the chief sususa answer laugh wait a minut and the
littl girl will grow to women and women ar good enough to fight
against boer
the attack zulu heard the mockeri of their fellow and rush
forward again with a roar but the boer in the laager had found time to
load and thei met with a warm recept reserv their fire till the
zulu were pack like sheep in a kraal thei loos into them with the
roer and the warrior fell in littl heap but i saw that the blood
of the umtetwa wa up thei did not mean to be beaten back thi time
and the end wa near see six men had leapt on to a waggon slain the
man behind it and sprung into the laager thei were kill there but
other follow and then i turn my head but i could not shut my ear
to the cri of rage and death and the terribl sgee sgee of the
savag as thei did their work of murder onc onli i look up and saw
poor han botha stand on a waggon smite down men with the butt of
hi rifl the assegai shot up toward him like tongu of steel and
when i look again he wa gone
i turn sick with fear and rage but ala what could i do thei were
all dead now and probabl my own turn wa come onli my death with
not be so swift
the fight wa end and the two line on the slope broke their order
and move down to the laager present we were there and a dread
sight it wa mani of the attack zulu were deadquit fifti i
should sai and at least a hundr and fifti were wound some of them
mortal the chief sususa gave an order the dead men were pick up
and pile in a heap while those who were slightli hurt walk off to
find some on to tie up their wound but the more seriou case met
with a differ treatment the chief or on of hi induna consid
each case and if it wa in ani wai bad the man wa taken up and thrown
into the river which ran near none of them offer ani object
though on poor fellow swam to shore again he did not stop there long
howev for thei push him back and drown him by forc
the strangest case of all wa that of the chief own brother he had
been captain of the line and hi ankl wa smash by a bullet sususa
came up to him and have examin the wound rate him soundli for
fail in the first onslaught
the poor fellow made the excus that it wa not hi fault as the boer
had hit him in the first rush hi brother admit the truth of thi
and talk to him amic
well he said at length offer him a pinch of snuff you cannot
walk again
no chief said the wound man look at hi ankl
and tomorrow we must walk far went on sususa
ye chief
sai then will you sit here on the veldt or and he nod
toward the river
the man drop hi head on hi breast for a minut as though in
thought present he lift it and look sususa straight in the face
my ankl pain me my brother he said i think i will go back to
zululand for there is the onli kraal i wish to see again even if i
creep about it like a snake
the zulu believ that after death their spirit enter
into the bodi of larg green snake which glide about the
kraal to kill these snake is sacrileg
it is well my brother said the chief rest softli and have
shaken hand with him he gave an order to on of the induna and
turn awai
then men came and support the wound man led him down to the
bank of the stream here at hi request thei ti a heavi stone
round hi neck and then threw him into a deep pool i saw the whole sad
scene and the victim never even winc it wa imposs not to admir
the extraordinari courag of the man or to avoid be struck with
the coldblood cruelti of hi brother the chief and yet the act wa
necessari from hi point of view the man must either die swiftli or
be left to perish of starvat for no zulu forc will encumb itself
with wound men year of merciless warfar had so harden these
peopl that thei look on death as noth and were to do them
justic as will to meet it themselv as to inflict it on other
when thi veri impi had been sent out by the zulu king dingaan it
consist of some nine thousand men now it number less than three
all the rest were dead thei too would probabl soon be dead what did
it matter thei live by war to die in blood it wa their natur end
kill till you ar kill that is the motto of the zulu soldier it
ha the merit of simplic
meanwhil the warrior were loot the waggon includ my own
have first thrown all the dead boer into a heap i look at the
heap all of them were there includ the two stout frau poor
thing but i miss on bodi that of han botha daughter littl
tota a wild hope came into my heart that she might have escap but
no it wa not possibl i could onli prai that she wa alreadi at rest
just then the great zulu bombyan who had left my side to indulg in
the congeni occup of loot came out of a waggon cry that
he had got the littl white on i look he wa carri the child
tota grip her frock in on of hi huge black hand he stalk
up to where we were and held the child befor the chief is it dead
father he said with a laugh
now as i could well see the child wa not dead but had been hidden
awai and faint with fear
the chief glanc at it carelessli and said
find out with your kerri
act on thi hint the black devil held up the child and wa about to
kill it with hi knobstick thi wa more than i could bear i sprang at
him and struck him with all my forc in the face littl care if i wa
spear or not he drop tota on the ground
ou he said put hi hand to hi nose the white spirit ha a
hard fist come spirit i will fight you for the child
the soldier cheer and laugh ye ye thei said let bombyan
fight the white spirit for the child let them fight with assegai
for a moment i hesit what chanc had i against thi black giant
but i had promis poor han to save the child if i could and what did
it matter as well die now as later howev i had wit enough left to
make a favour of it and intim to the chief through indabazimbi
that i wa quit will to condescend to kill bombyan on condit
that if i did so the child life should be given to me indabazimbi
interpret my word but i notic that he would not look on me as
he spoke but cover hi face with hi hand and spoke of me as the
ghost or the son of the spirit for some reason that i have never
quit understood the chief consent to the duel i fanci it wa
becaus he believ me to be more than mortal and wa anxiou to see
the last of bombyan
let them fight he said give them assegai and no shield the child
shall be to him who conquer
ye ye cri the soldier let them fight dont be afraid
bombyan if he is a spirit he a veri small on
i never wa frighten of man or beast and i am not go to run awai
from a white ghost answer the redoubt bombyan as he examin
the blade of hi great bangwan or stab assegai
then thei made a ring round us gave me a similar assegai and set us
some ten pace apart i kept my face as calm as i could and tri to
show no sign of fear though in my heart i wa terribl afraid humanli
speak my doom wa on me the giant warrior befor me had us the
assegai from a childi had no experi of the weapon moreov
though i wa quick and activ he must have been at least twice as
strong as i am howev there wa no help for it so set my teeth
i grasp the great spear breath a prayer and wait
the giant stood awhil look at me and as he stood indabazimbi
walk across the ring behind me mutter as he pass keep cool
macumazahn and wait for him i will make it all right
as i had not the slightest intent of commenc the frai i thought
thi good advic though how indabazimbi could make it all right i
fail to see
heaven how long that halfminut seem it happen mani year ago
but the whole scene rise up befor my ey as i write there behind us
wa the bloodstain laager and near it lai the pile of dead round
us wa rank upon rank of plume savag stand in silenc to wait
the issu of the duel and in the centr stood the greyhair chief and
gener sususa in all hi war fineri a cloak of leopard skin upon hi
shoulder at hi feet lai the senseless form of littl tota to my
left squat indabazimbi nod hi white lock and mutter
somethingprob spell while in front wa my giant antagonist hi
spear aloft and hi plume waver in the gentl wind then over all
over grassi slope river and koppi over the waggon of the laager
the pile of dead the dens mass of the live the swoon
child over all shone the bright imparti sun look down like the
indiffer ey of heaven upon the loveli of natur and the cruelti
of man down by the river grew thorntre and from them float
the sweet scent of the mimosa flower and came the sound of coo
turtledov i never smell the on or hear the other without the scene
flash into my mind again complet in it everi detail
suddenli without a sound bombyan shook hi assegai and rush
straight at me i saw hi huge form come like a man in a dream i saw
the broad spear flash on high now he wa on me then prompt to it by
some providenti impulseor had the spell of indabazimbi anyth to
do with the matteri drop to my knee and quick as light stretch
out my spear he drove at me the blade pass over my head i felt
a weight on my assegai it wa wrench from my hand hi great limb
knock against me i glanc round bombyan wa stagger along with
head thrown back and outstretch arm from which hi spear had fallen
hi spear had fallen but the blade of mine stood out between hi
shouldersi had transfix him he stop swung slowli round as
though to look at me then with a sigh the giant sank downdead
for a moment there wa silenc then a great cry rosea cry of
bombyan is dead the white spirit ha slain bombyan kill the wizard
kill the ghost who ha slain bombyan by witchcraft
instantli i wa surround by fierc face and spear flash befor my
ey i fold my arm and stood calmli wait the end in a moment
it would have come for the warrior were mad at see their champion
overthrown thu easili but present through the tumult i heard the
high crack voic of indabazimbi
stand back you fool it cri can a spirit then be kill
spear him spear him thei roar in furi let us see if he is a
spirit how did a spirit slai bombyan with an assegai spear him
rainmak and we shall see
stand back cri indabazimbi again and i will show you if he
can be kill i will kill him myself and call him back to life again
befor your ey
macumazahn trust me he whisper in my ear in the sisutu tongu
which the zulu did not understand trust me kneel on the grass befor
me and when i strike at you with the spear roll over like on dead
then when you hear my voic again get up trust meit is your onli
hope
have no choic i nod my head in assent though i had not the
faintest idea of what he wa about to do the tumult lessen somewhat
and onc more the warrior drew back
great white spiritspirit of victori said indabazimbi address
me aloud and cover hi ey with hi hand hear me and forgiv me
these children ar blind with folli and think thee mortal becaus thou
hast dealt death upon a mortal who dare to stand against thee deign to
kneel down befor me and let me pierc thy heart with thi spear then
when i call upon thee aris unhurt
i knelt down not becaus i wish to but becaus i must i had not
overmuch faith in indabazimbi and thought it probabl that he wa
in truth about to make an end of me but realli i wa so worn out with
fear and the horror of the night and dai had so shaken my nerv
that i did not greatli care what befel me when i had been kneel
thu for about half a minut indabazimbi spoke
peopl of the umtetwa children of tchaka he said draw back a
littl wai lest an evil fall on you for now the air is thick with
ghost
thei drew back a space leav us in a circl about twelv yard in
diamet
look on him who kneel befor you went on indabazimbi and
listen to my word to the word of the witchfind the word of the
rainmak indabazimbi whose fame is known to you he seem to be a
young man doe he not i tell you children of the umtetwa he is no
man he is the spirit who give victori to the white men he it is who
gave them assegai that thunder and taught them how to slai why were
the impi of dingaan roll back at the blood river becaus he
wa there why did the amaboona slai the peopl of mosilikatz by the
thousand becaus he wa there and so i sai to you that had i not
drawn him from the laager by my magic but three hour ago you would
have been conqueredy you would have been blown awai like the dust
befor the wind you would have been burnt up like the dry grass in
the winter when the fire is awak among it ay becaus he had but been
there mani of your bravest were slain in overcom a fewa pinch
of men who could be count on the finger but becaus i love you
becaus your chief sususa is my halfbrotherfor had we not on
fatheri came to you i warn you then you prai me and i drew the
spirit forth but you were not satisfi when the victori wa your
when the spirit of all you had taken ask but on littl thinga
white child to take awai and sacrific to himself to make the medicin
of hi magic of
here i could hardli restrain myself from interrupt but thought
better of it
you said him nai you said let him fight with our bravest man let
him fight with bombyan the giant for the child and he deign to slai
bombyan as you have seen and now you sai slai him he is no spirit
now i will show you if he is a spirit for i will slai him befor
your ey and call him to life again but you have brought thi upon
yourselv had you believ had you offer no insult to the spirit
he would have stai with you and you should have becom unconquer
now he will aris and leav you and woe be on you if you try to stai
him
now all men he went on look for a space upon thi assegai that i
hold up and he lift the bangwan of the deceas bombyan high abov
hi head so that all the multitud could see it everi ey wa fix
upon the broad bright spear for a while he held it still then he move
it round and round in a circl mutter as he did so and still their
gaze follow it for my part i watch hi movement with the greatest
anxieti that assegai had alreadi been nearer my person than i found at
all pleasant and i had no desir to make a further acquaint with
it nor inde wa i sure that indabazimbi wa not realli go to
kill me i could not understand hi proceed at all and at the best
i did not relish plai the corpu vile to hi magic experi
look look look he scream
then suddenli the great spear flash down toward my breast i felt
noth but to my sight it seem as though it had pass through me
see roar the zulu indabazimbi ha spear him the red assegai
stand out behind hi back
roll over macumazahn indabazimbi hiss in my ear roll over and
pretend to diequick quick
i lost no time in follow these strang instruct but fall
on to my side threw my arm wide kick my leg about and di as
artist as i could present i gave a stage shiver and lai still
see said the zulu he is dead the spirit is dead look at the
blood upon the assegai
stand back stand back cri indabazimbi or the ghost will haunt
you ye he is dead and now i will call him back to life again look
and put down hi hand he pluck the spear from wherev it wa
fix and held it aloft the spear is red is it not watch men
watch it grow white
ye it grow white thei said ou it grow white
it grow white becaus the blood return to whenc it came said
indabazimbi now great spirit hear me thou art dead the breath ha
gone out of thy mouth yet hear me and aris awak white spirit awak
and show thy power awak aris unhurt
i began to respond cheerfulli to thi impos invoc
not so fast macumazahn whisper indabazimbi
i took the hint and first held up my arm then lift my head and let
it fall again
he live by the head of tchaka he live roar the soldier
stricken with mortal fear
then slowli and with the greatest digniti i gradual aros stretch
my arm yawn like on awak from heavi sleep turn and look
upon them unconcernedli while i did so i notic that old indabazimbi
wa almost faint from exhaust bead of perspir stood upon
hi brow hi limb trembl and hi breast heav
as for the zulu thei wait for no more with a howl of terror the
whole regiment turn and fled across the rise so that present we
were left alon with the dead and the swoon child
how on earth did you do that indabazimbi i ask in amaz
do not ask me macumazahn he gasp you white men ar veri clever
but you dont quit know everyth there ar men in the world who can
make peopl believ thei see thing which thei do not see let us be
go while we mai for when those umtetwa have got over their fright
thei will come back to loot the waggon and then perhap thei will
begin ask question that i cant answer
and here i mai as well state that i never got ani further inform on
thi matter from old indabazimbi but i have my theori and here it is
for whatev it mai be worth i believ that indabazimbi mesmer
the whole crowd of onlook myself includ make them believ that
thei saw the assegai in my heart and the blood upon the blade the
reader mai smile and sai imposs but i would ask him how
the indian juggler do their trick unless it is by mesmer the
spectat seem to see the boi go under the basket and there pierc
with dagger thei seem to see women in a tranc support in midair
upon the point of a singl sword in themselv these thing ar not
possibl thei violat the law of natur as those law ar known to
us and therefor must sure be illus and so through the glamour
thrown upon them by indabazimbi will that zulu impi seem to see me
transfix with an assegai which never touch me at least that is my
theori if ani on ha a better let him adopt it the explan li
between illus and magic of a most impos charact and i prefer to
accept the first altern
chapter vi
stella
i wa not slow to take indabazimbi hint about a hundr and fifti
yard to the left of the laager wa a littl dell where i had hidden
my hors togeth with on belong to the boer and my saddl and
bridl thither we went i carri the swoon tota in my arm to our
joi we found the hors safe for the zulu had not seen them now of
cours thei were our onli mean of locomot for the oxen had been
sent awai and even had thei been there we could not have found time to
inspan them i laid tota down caught my hors undid hi knee halter
and saddl up as i wa do so a thought struck me and i told
indabazimbi to run to the laager and see if he could find my
doublebarrel gun and some powder and shot for i had onli my
eleph roer and a few charg of powder and ball with me
he went and while he wa awai poor littl tota came to herself and
began to cry till she saw my face
ah i have had such a bad dream she said in dutch i dream that
the black kaffir were go to kill me where is my papa
i winc at the question your papa ha gone on a journei dear i
said and left me to look after you we shall find him on dai you
dont mind go with heer allan do you
no she said a littl doubtfulli and began to cry again present
she rememb that she wa thirsti and ask for water i led her to
the river and she drank why is my hand red heer allan she ask
point to the smear of bombyan bloodstain finger
at thi moment i felt veri glad that i had kill bombyan
it is onli paint dear i said see we will wash it and your face
as i wa do thi indabazimbi return the gun were all gone
he said the zulu had taken them and the powder but he had found some
thing and brought them in a sack there wa a thick blanket about
twenti pound weight of biltong or sundri meat a few doublehand
of biscuit two waterbottl a tin pannikin some match and
sundri
and now macumazahn he said we had best be go for those
umtetwa ar come back i saw on of them on the brow of the rise
that wa enough for me i lift littl tota on to the bow of my saddl
climb into it and rode off hold her in front of me indabazimbi
slip a reim into the mouth of the best of the boer hors threw
of the sack of sundri on to it back and mount also hold the
eleph gun in hi hand we went eight or nine hundr yard in silenc
till we were quit out of rang of sight from the waggon which were
in a hollow then i pull up with such a feel of thank in
my heart as cannot be told in word for now i knew that mount as
we were those black demon could never catch us but where were we to
steer for i put the question to indabazimbi ask him if he thought
that we had better try and follow the oxen which we had sent awai with
the kaffir and women on the preced night he shook hi head
the umtetwa will go after the oxen present he answer and we
have seen enough of them
quit enough i answer with enthusiasm i never want to see
anoth but where ar we to go here we ar alon with on gun and a
littl girl in the vast and lone veldt which wai shall we turn
our face were toward the north befor we met the zulu answer
indabazimbi let us still keep them to the north ride on macumazahn
tonight when we offsaddl i will look into the matter
so all that long afternoon we rode on follow the cours of the
river from the natur of the ground we could onli go slowli but befor
sunset i had the satisfact of know that there must be at least
twentyf mile between us and those accurs zulu littl tota slept
most of the wai the motion of the hors wa easi and she wa worn out
at last the sunset came and we offsaddl in a dell by the river
there wa not much to eat but i soak some biscuit in water for tota
and indabazimbi and i made a scanti meal of biltong when we had done i
took off tota frock wrap her up in a blanket near the fire we had
made and lit a pipe i sat there by the side of the sleep orphan
child and from my heart thank provid for save her life and mine
from the slaughter of that dai what a horribl experi it had been
it seem like a nightmar to look back upon and yet it wa sober fact
on among those mani tragedi which dot the path of the emigr
boer with the bone of men women and children these horror ar
almost forgotten now peopl live in natal now for instanc can
scarc realiz that some forti year ago six hundr white peopl
mani of them women and children were thu massacr by the impi of
dingaan but it wa so and the name of the district weenen or the
place of weep will commemor them for ever
then i fell to reflect on the extraordinari adroit old
indabazimbi had shown in save my life it appear that he himself
had live among the umtetwa zulu in hi earlier manhood and wa a
note raindoctor and witchfind but when tchaka dingaan brother
order a gener massacr of the witchfind he alon had save hi
life by hi skill in magic and ultim fled south for reason too
long to set out here when he heard therefor that the regiment wa
an umtetwa regiment which leav their wive and children had broken
awai from zululand to escap the cruelti of dingaan under pretenc
of spy on them he took the bold cours of go straight up to the
chief sususa and address him as hi brother which he wa the
chief knew him at onc and so did the soldier for hi fame wa still
great among them then he told them hi cock and bull stori about my
be a white spirit whose presenc in the laager would render it
invinc and with the object of save my life in the slaughter which
he knew must ensu agre to charm me out of the laager and deliv me
into their keep how the plan work ha alreadi been told it wa a
riski on still but for it my troubl would have been done with these
mani dai
so i lai and thought with a heart full of gratitud and as i did so saw
old indabazimbi sit by the fire and go through some mysteri
perform with bone which he produc from hi bag and ash mix
with water i spoke to him and ask what he wa about he repli that
he wa trace out the rout that we should follow i felt inclin to
answer bosh but rememb the veri remark instanc which he
had given of hi prowess in occult matter i held my tongu and take
littl tota into my arm worn out with toil and danger and emot i
went to sleep
i awok just as the dawn wa begin to flame across the sky in sheet
of primros and of gold or rather it wa littl tota who woke me by
kiss me as she lai between sleep and wake and call me papa
it wrung my heart to hear her poor orphan child i got up wash
and dress her as best i could and we breakfast as we had sup
on biltong and biscuit tota ask for milk but i had none to give her
then we caught the hors and i saddl mine
well indabazimbi i said now what path do your bone point to
straight north he said the journei will be hard but in about four
dai we shall come to the kraal of a white man an englishman not
a boer hi kraal is in a beauti place and there is a great peak
behind it where there ar mani baboon
i look at him thi is all nonsens indabazimbi i said whoever
heard of an englishman build a hous in these wild and how do you
know anyth about it i think that we had better strike east toward
port natal
as you like macumazahn he answer but it will take us three
month journei to get to port natal if we ever get there and the
child will die on the road sai macumazahn have my word come true
heretofor or have thei not did i not tell you not to hunt the
eleph on horseback did i not tell you to take on waggon with you
instead of two as it is better to lose on than two
you told me all these thing i answer
and so i tell you now to ride north macumazahn for there you will
find great happinessy and great sorrow but no man should run awai
from happi becaus of the sorrow as you will as you will
again i look at him in hi divin i did not believ yet i came
to the conclus that he wa speak what he knew to be the truth it
struck me as possibl that he might have heard of some white man live
like a hermit in the wild but prefer to keep up hi prophet
charact would not sai so
veri well indabazimbi i said let us ride north
shortli after we start the river we had follow hitherto turn
off in a westerli direct so we left it all that dai we rode across
roll upland and about an hour befor sunset halt at a littl
stream which ran down from a rang of hill in front of us by thi time
i wa heartili tire of the biltong so take my eleph riflefor i
had noth elsei left tota with indabazimbi and start to try if i
could shoot someth oddli enough we had seen no game all the dai nor
did we see ani on the subsequ dai for some mysteri reason thei
had temporarili left the district i cross the littl streamlet in
order to enter the belt of thorn which grew upon the hillsid beyond
for there i hope to find buck as i did so i wa rather disturb to
see the spoor of two lion in the soft sandi edg of a pool breath
a hope that thei might not still be in the neighbourhood i went on into
the belt of scatter thorn for a long while i hunt about without
see anyth except on duiker buck which bound off with a crash
from the other side of a stone without give me a chanc at length
just as it grew dusk i spi a peti buck a grace littl creatur
scarc bigger than a larg hare stand on a stone about forti
yard from me under ordinari circumst i should never have dream
of fire at such a thing especi with an eleph gun but we were
hungri so i sat down with my back against a rock and aim steadili at
it head i did thi becaus if i struck it in the bodi the threeounc
ball would have knock it to bit at last i pull the trigger
the gun went off with the report of a small cannon and the buck
disappear i ran to the spot with more anxieti than i should have felt
in an ordinari wai over a koodoo or an eland to my delight there the
littl creatur layth huge bullet had decapit it consid all
the circumst i do not think i have often made a better shot than
thi but if ani on doubt let him try hi hand at a rabbit head
fifti yard awai with an eleph gun and a threeounc ball
i pick up the peti in triumph and return to the camp there we
skin him and toast hi flesh over the fire he just made a good
meal for us though we kept the hind leg for breakfast
there wa no moon thi night and so it chanc that when i suddenli
rememb about the lion spoor and suggest that we had better tie
up the hors quit close to us we could not find them though we knew
thei were graze within fifti yard thi be so we could onli make
up the fire and take our chanc shortli afterward i went to sleep
with littl tota in my arm suddenli i wa awaken by hear that
peculiarli pain sound the scream of a hors quit close to the
fire which wa still burn brightli next second there came a nois
of gallop hoof and befor i could even rise my poor hors appear
in the ring of firelight as in a flash of lightn i saw hi stare
ey and widestretch nostril and the broken reim with which he had
been kneehalt fly in the air also i saw someth els for on
hi back wa a great dark form with glow ey and from the form came
a growl sound it wa a lion
the hors dash on he gallop right through the fire for which he
had run in hi terror fortun howev without tread on us and
vanish into the night we heard hi hoof for a hundr yard or more
then there wa silenc broken now and again by distant growl as mai
be imagin we did not sleep ani more that night but wait anxious
till the dawn broke two hour later
as soon as there wa suffici light we rose and leav tota
still asleep crept cautious in the direct in which the hors had
vanish when we had gone fifti yard or so we made out it remain
ly on the veldt and caught sight of two great catlik form
slink awai in the grei light
to go ani further wa useless we knew all about it now so we turn
to look for the other hors but our cup of misfortun wa not yet full
the hors wa nowher to be found terrifi by the sight and smell of
the lion it had with a desper effort also burst the reim with which
it had been kneehalt and gallop far awai i sat down feel
as though i could cry like a woman for now we were left alon in these
vast solitud without a hors to carri us and with a child who wa not
old enough to walk for more than a littl wai at a time
well it wa no us give in so with a few word we went back to our
camp where i found tota cry becaus she had woke to find herself
alon then we at a littl food and prepar to start first we divid
such articl as we must take with us into two equal part reject
everyth that we could possibl do without then by an afterthought
we fill our waterbottl though at the time i wa rather against
do so becaus of the extra weight but indabazimbi overrul me
in the matter fortun for all three of us i settl to look after
tota for the first march and to give the eleph gun to indabazimbi
at length all wa readi and we set out on foot by the help of
occasion lift over rough place tota manag to walk up the slope of
the hillsid where i had shot the peti buck at length we reach it
and look at the countri beyond i gave an exclam of dismai to
sai that it wa desert would be sai too much it wa more like the
karroo in the capea vast sandi wast stud here and there with low
shrub and scatter rock but it wa a great expans of desol land
stretch further than the ey could reach and border far awai by
a line of purpl hill in the centr of which a great solitari peak
soar high into the air
indabazimbi i said we can never cross thi if we take six dai
as you will macumazahn he answer but i tell you that thereand
he point to the peakther the white man live turn which wai you
like but if you turn you will perish
i reflect for a moment our case wa humanli speak almost
hopeless it matter littl which wai we went we were alon almost
without food with no mean of transport and a child to carri as well
perish in the sandi wast as on the roll veldt or among the tree
of the hillsid provid alon could save us and we must trust to
provid
come on i said lift tota on to my back for she wa alreadi
tire all road lead to rest
how am i to describ the miseri of the next four dai how am i to tell
how we stumbl on through that aw desert almost without food and
quit without water for there were no stream and we saw no spring
we soon found how the case wa and save almost all the water in our
bottl for the child to look back on it is like a nightmar i can
scarc bear to dwell on it dai after dai by turn carri the
child through the heavi sand night after night ly down in the scrub
chew the leav and lick such dew as there wa from the scanti
grass not a spring not a pool not a head of game it wa the third
night we were nearli mad with thirst tota wa in a comatos condit
indabazimbi still had a littl water in hi bottleperhap a
wineglass with it we moisten our lip and blacken tongu then
we gave the rest to the child it reviv her she awok from her swoon
to sink into sleep
see the dawn wa break the hill were not more than eight mile or
so awai now and thei were green there must be water there
come i said
indabazimbi lift tota into the kind of sling that we had made out of
the blanket in which to carri her on our back and we stagger on for
an hour through the sand she awok cry for water and ala we
had none to give her our tongu were hang from our lip we could
scarc speak
we rest awhil and tota mercifulli swoon awai again then
indabazimbi took her though he wa so thin the old man strength wa
wonder
anoth hour the slope of the great peak could not be more than two
mile awai now a coupl of hundr yard off grew a larg baobab
tree could we reach it shade we had done half the distanc when
indabazimbi fell from exhaust we were now so weak that neither of
us could lift the child on to our back he rose again and we each
took on of her hand and drag her along the road fifti yardsthei
seem to be fifti mile ah the tree wa reach at last compar
with the heat outsid the shade of it dens foliag seem like the
dusk and cool of a vault i rememb think that it wa a good place
to die in then i rememb no more
i woke with a feel as though the bless rain were fall on my face
and head slowli and with great difficulti i open my ey then shut
them again have seen a vision for a space i lai thu while the rain
continu to fall i saw now that i must be asleep or off my head with
thirst and fever if i were not off my head how came i to imagin that a
love darkei girl wa bend over me sprinkl water on my face a
white girl too not a kaffir woman howev the dream went on
hendrika said a voic in english the sweetest voic that i had ever
heard somehow it remind me of wind whisper in the tree at night
hendrika i fear he di there is a flask of brandi in my saddlebag
get it
ah ah grunt a harsh voic in answer let him die miss stella he
will bring you bad lucklet him die i sai i felt a movement of air
abov me as though the woman of my vision turn swiftli and onc again
i open my ey she had risen thi dream woman now i saw that she
wa tall and grace as a reed she wa angri too her dark ey
flash and she point with her hand at a femal who stood befor her
dress in nondescript kind of cloth such as might be worn by either
a man or a woman the woman wa young of white blood veri short with
bow leg and enorm shoulder in face she wa not badlook
but the brow reced the chin and ear were prominentin short she
remind me of noth so much as a veri handsom monkei she might have
been the miss link
the ladi wa point at her with her hand how dare you she said
ar you go to disobei me again have you forgotten what i told you
babyan
baboon
ah ah grunt the woman who seem liter to curl and shrivel up
beneath her anger dont be angri with me miss stella becaus i cant

then dream or no dream i determin to speak
not brandi i gasp in english as well as my swollen tongu would
allow give me water
ah he live cri the beauti girl and he talk english see
sir here is water in your own bottl you were quit close to a spring
it is on the other side of the tree
i struggl to a sit posit lift the bottl to my lip and
drank from it oh that drink of cool pure water never had i tast
anyth so delici with the first gulp i felt life flow back into
me but wise enough she would not let me have much no more no
more she said and drag the bottl from me almost by forc
the child i saidi the child dead
i do not know yet she answer we have onli just found you and i
tri to reviv you first
i turn and crept to where tota lai by the side of indabazimbi it
wa imposs to sai if thei were dead or swoon the ladi sprinkl
tota face with the water which i watch greedili for my thirst
wa still aw while the woman hendrika did the same offic for
indabazimbi present to my vast delight tota open her ey and
tri to cry but could not poor littl thing becaus her tongu and
lip were so swollen but the ladi got some water into her mouth and
as in my case the effect wa magic we allow her to drink about a
quarter of a pint and no more though she cri bitterli for it just
then old indabazimbi came to with a groan he open hi ey glanc
round and took in the situat
what did i tell you macumazahn he gasp and seiz the bottl he
took a long pull at it
meanwhil i sat with my back against the trunk of the great tree and
tri to realiz the situat look to my left i saw too good
horseson bareback and on with a rude made ladi saddl on
it by the side of the hors were two dog of a stout greyhound breed
that sat watch us and near the dog lai a dead orib buck which
thei had evid been cours
hendrika said the ladi present thei must not eat meat just yet
go look up the tree and see if there is ani ripe fruit on it
the woman ran swiftli into the plain and obei present she return
i see some ripe fruit she said but it is high quit at the top
fetch it said the ladi
easier said than done i thought to myself but i wa much mistaken
suddenli the woman bound at least three feet into the air and caught
on of the spread bough in her larg flat hand then came a swing
that would have fill an acrobat with envyand she wa on it
now there is an end i thought again for the next bough wa beyond
her reach but again i wa mistaken she stood up on the bough grip
it with her bare feet and onc more sprang at the on abov caught it
and swung herself into it
i suppos that the ladi saw my express of astonish do not
wonder sir she said hendrika is not like other peopl she will not
fall
i made no answer but watch the progress of thi extraordinari person
with the most breathless interest on she went swing herself from
bough to bough and run along them like a monkei at last she
reach the top and began to swarm up a thin branch toward the ripe
fruit when she wa near enough she shook the branch violent there
wa a cracka crashit broke i shut my ey expect to see her
crush on the ground befor me
dont be afraid said the ladi again laugh gentli look she is
quit safe
i look and so she wa she had caught a bough as she fell clung to
it and wa now calmli drop to anoth old indabazimbi had also
watch thi perform with interest but it did not seem to astonish
him overmuch baboonwoman he said as though such peopl were
common and then turn hi attent to sooth tota who wa moan
for more water meanwhil hendrika came down the tree with extraordinari
rapid and swing by on hand from a bough drop about eight
feet to the ground
in anoth two minut we were all three suck the pulpi fruit in
an ordinari wai we should have found it tasteless enough as it wa i
thought it the most delici thing i had ever tast after three dai
spent without food or water in the desert on is not particular while
we were still eat the fruit the ladi of my vision set her companion
to work to partial flai the orib which her dog had kill and
busi herself in make a fire of fallen bough as soon as it burn
brightli she took strip of the orib flesh toast them and gave them
to us on leav we at and now were allow a littl more water after

of speech by ani more polit term sometim she grunt like a monkei
sometim she click like a bushman and sometim she did both
togeth when she becam quit unintellig
i expostul against thi propos arrang sai that we could
walk which wa a fib for i do not think that i could have done a mile
but stella would not listen she would not even let me carri my eleph
gun but took it herself so we mount with some difficulti and
hendrika took up the sleep tota in her long sinewi arm
see that the baboonwoman doe not run awai into the mountain with
the littl white on said indabazimbi to me in kaffir as he climb
slowli on to the hors
unfortun hendrika understood hi speech her face twist and grew
livid with furi she put down tota and liter sprang at indabazimbi
as a monkei spring but weari and worn as he wa the old gentleman
wa too quick for her with an exclam of genuin fright he threw
himself from the hors on the further side with the somewhat ludicr
result that all in a moment hendrika wa occupi the seat which he had
vacat just then stella realiz the posit
come down you savag come down she said stamp her foot
the extraordinari creatur flung herself from the hors and liter
grovel on the ground befor her mistress and burst into tear
pardon miss stella she click and grunt in villain english
but he call me babyanfrau baboonwoman
tell your servant that he must not us such word to hendrika mr
allan stella said to me if he doe she ad in a whisper
hendrika will certainli kill him
i explain thi to indabazimbi who be consider frighten
deign to apolog but from that hour there wa hate and war between
these two
harmoni have been thu restor we start the dog follow us
a small strip of desert interven between us and the slope of the
peakperhap it wa two mile wide we cross it and reach rich
grass land for here a consider stream gather from the hill but
it did not flow across the barren land it pass to the east along
the foot of the hill thi stream we had to cross by a ford hendrika
walk boldli through it hold tota in her arm stella leapt across
from stone to stone like a roebuck i thought to myself that she wa the
most grace creatur that i had ever seen after thi the track pass
around a pleasantlywood shoulder of the peak which wa i found
known as babyan kap or baboon head of cours we could onli go at
a foot pace so our progress wa slow stella walk for some wai in
silenc then she spoke
tell me mr allan she said how it wa that i came to find you
dy in the desert
so i began and told her all it took an hour or more to do so and she
listen intent now and again ask a question
it is all veri wonder she said when i had done veri wonder
inde do you know i went out thi morn with hendrika and the dog
for a ride mean to get back home by middai for my father is ill
and i do not like to leav him for long but just as i wa go to
turn when we were about where we ar nowy that wa the veri
bushan orib got up and the dog chase it i follow them for the
gallop and when we came to the river instead of turn to the left as
buck gener do the orib swam the stream and took to the bad land
beyond i follow it and within a hundr yard of the big tree the
dog kill it hendrika want to turn back at onc but i said that
we would rest under the shade of the tree for i knew that there wa a
spring of water near well we went and there i saw you all ly like
dead but hendrika who is veri clever in some wai said noand you
know the rest ye it is veri wonder
it is inde i said now tell me miss stella who is hendrika
she look round befor answer to see that the woman wa not near
her is a strang stori mr allan i will tell you you must know that
all these mountain and the countri beyond ar full of baboon when i
wa a girl of about ten i us to wander a great deal alon in the hill
and vallei and watch the baboon as thei plai among the rock there
wa on famili of baboon that i watch especiallythei us to live
in a kloof about a mile from the hous the old man baboon wa veri
larg and on of the femal had a grei face but the reason why
i watch them so much wa becaus i saw that thei had with them a
creatur that look like a girl for her skin wa quit white and
what wa more that she wa protect from the weather when it happen
to be cold by a fur belt of some sort which wa ti round her throat
the old baboon seem to be especi fond of her and would sit with
their arm round her neck for nearli a whole summer i watch thi
particular whiteskin baboon till at last my curios quit
overmast me i notic that though she climb about the cliff
with the other monkei at a certain hour a littl befor sundown thei
us to put her with on or two other much smaller on into a littl
cave while the famili went off somewher to get food to the meali
field i suppos then i got an idea that i would catch thi white
baboon and bring it home but of cours i could not do thi by myself
so i took a hottentota veri clever man when he wa not drunkwho
live on the stead into my confid he wa call hendrik and wa
veri fond of me but for a long while he would not listen to my plan
becaus he said that the babyan would kill us at last i bribe him
with a knife that had four blade and on afternoon we start hendrik
carri a stout sack made of hide with a rope run through it so
that the mouth could be drawn tight
well we got to the place and hide ourselv carefulli in the tree
at the foot of the kloof watch the baboon plai about and grunt
to each other till at length accord to custom thei took the white
on and three other littl babi and put them in the cave then the old
man came out look carefulli round call to hi famili and went off
with them over the brow of the kloof now veri slowli and cautious we
crept up over the rock till we came to the mouth of the cave and look
in all the four littl baboon were fast asleep with their back
toward us and their arm round each other neck the white on be
in the middl noth could have been better for our plan hendrik
who by thi time had quit enter into the spirit of the thing crept
along the cave like a snake and suddenli drop the mouth of the hide
bag over the head of the white baboon the poor littl thing woke up and
gave a violent jump which caus it to vanish right into the bag then
hendrik pull the string tight and togeth we knot it so that
it wa imposs for our captiv to escap meanwhil the other babi
baboon had rush from the cave scream and when we got outsid thei
were nowher to be seen
come on missi said hendrik the babyan will soon be back he
had shoulder the sack insid of which the white baboon wa kick
violent and scream like a child it wa dread to hear it
shriek
we scrambl down the side of the kloof and ran for home as fast as
we could manag when we were near the waterfal and within about three
hundr yard of the garden wall we heard a voic behind us and there
leap from rock to rock and run over the grass wa the whole
famili of baboon head by the old man
run missi run gasp hendrik and i did like the wind leav
him far behind i dash into the garden where some kaffir were
work cry the babyan the babyan luckili the men had their
stick and spear by them and ran out just in time to save hendrik who
wa almost overtaken the baboon made a good fight for it howev
and it wa not till the old man wa kill with an assegai that thei ran
awai
well there is a stone hut in the kraal at the stead where my father
sometim shut up nativ who have misbehav it is veri strong and
ha a bar window to thi hut hendrik carri the sack and have
unti the mouth put it down on the floor and ran from the place
shut the door behind him in anoth moment the poor littl thing
wa out and dash round the stone hut as though it were mad it sprung
at the bar of the window clung there and beat it head against them
till the blood came then it fell to the floor and sat upon it cry
like a child and rock itself backward and forward it wa so sad
to see it that i began to cry too
just then my father came in and ask what all the fuss wa about i
told him that we had caught a young white baboon and he wa angri and
said that it must be let go but when he look at it through the bar
of the window he nearli fell down with astonish
why he said thi is not a baboon it is a white child that the
baboon have stolen and brought up
now mr allan whether my father is right or wrong you can judg for
yourself you see hendrikaw name her that after hendrik who caught
hersh is a woman not a monkei and yet she ha mani of the wai
of monkei and look like on too you saw how she can climb for
instanc and you hear how she talk also she is veri savag and when
she is angri or jealou she seem to go mad though she is as clever as
anybodi i think that she must have been stolen by the baboon when
she wa quit tini and nurtur by them and that is why she is so like
them
but to go on my father said that it wa our duti to keep hendrika
at ani cost the worst of it wa that for three dai she would eat
noth and i thought that she would die for all the while she sat
and wail on the third dai howev i went to the bar of the window
place and held out a cup of milk and some fruit to her she look at
it for a long while then crept up moan took the milk from my hand
drank it greedili and afterward at the fruit from that time forward
she took food readili enough but onli if i would feed her
but i must tell you of the dread end of hendrik from the dai that
we captur hendrika the whole place began to swarm with baboon which
were evid emploi in watch the kraal on dai hendrik went out
toward the hill alon to gather some medicin he did not come back
again so the next dai search wa made by a big rock which i can show
you thei found hi scatter and broken bone the fragment of hi
assegai and four dead baboon thei had set upon him and torn him to
piec
my father wa veri much frighten at thi but still he would not let
hendrika go becaus he said that she wa human and that it wa our
duti to reclaim her and so we didto a certain extent at least after
the murder of hendrik the baboon vanish from the neighbourhood
and have onli return quit recent so at length we ventur to let
hendrika out by thi time she had grown veri fond of me still on the
first opportun she ran awai but in the even she return again
she had been seek the baboon and could not find them shortli
afterward she began to speaki taught herand from that time she ha
love me so that she will not leav me i think it would kill her if i
went awai from her she watch me all dai and at night sleep on the
floor of my hut onc too she save my life when i wa swept down the
river in flood but she is jealou and hate everybodi els look how
she is glare at you now becaus i am talk to you
i look hendrika wa tramp along with the child in her arm and
stare at me in a most sinist fashion out of the corner of her ey
while i wa reflect on the baboonwoman strang stori and think
that she wa an exceedingli awkward custom the path took a sudden
turn
look said stella there is our home is it not beauti
it wa beauti inde here on the western side of the great peak a
bai had been form in the mountain which might have measur eight
hundr or a thousand yard across by threequart of a mile in depth
at the back of thi indent the sheer cliff rose to the height of
sever hundr feet and behind it and abov it the great babyan peak
tower up toward the heaven the space of ground embrac thu in
the arm of the mountain as it were wa laid out as though by the
cun hand of man in three terrac that rose on abov the other to
the right and left of the topmost terrac were chasm in the cliff and
down each chasm fell a waterfal from no great height inde but of
consider volum these two stream flow awai on either side of
the enclos space on toward the north and the other the cours
of which we had been follow round the base of the mountain at each
terrac thei made a cascad so that the travel approach had a
view of eight waterfal at onc along the edg of the stream to our
left were place kaffir kraal built in orderli group with verandah
after the basutu fashion and a veri larg part of the entir space of
land wa under cultiv all of thi i note at onc as well as the
extraordinari rich and depth of the soil which for mani ag past
had been wash down from the mountain height then follow the line
of an excel waggon road on which we now found ourselv that wound
up from terrac to terrac my ey lit upon the crown wonder of the
scene for in the centr of the topmost platform or terrac which mai
have enclos eight or ten acr of ground and almost surround by
grove of orang tree gleam build of which i had never seen the
like there were three group of them on in the middl and on on
either side and a littl to the rear but as i afterward discov
the plan of all wa the same in the centr wa an edific construct
like an ordinari zulu hutthat is to sai in the shape of a beehiv
onli it wa five time the size of ani hut i ever saw and built
of block of hewn white marbl fit togeth with extraordinari
knowledg of the principl and properti of arch build and with so
much accuraci and finish that it wa often difficult to find the joint
of the massiv block from thi centr hut ran three cover passag
lead to other build of an exactli similar charact onli
smaller and each whole block wa enclos by a marbl wall about four
feet in height
of cours we were as yet too far off to see all these detail but the
gener outlin i saw at onc and it astonish me consider even
old indabazimbi whom the baboonwoman had been unabl to move deign
to show wonder
ou he said thi is a place of marvel who ever saw kraal built of
white stone
stella watch our face with an express of intens amus but
said noth
did your father build those kraal i gasp at length
my father no of cours not she answer how would it have been
possibl for on white man to do so or to have made thi road he found
them as you see
who built them then i said again
i do not know my father think that thei ar veri ancient for the
peopl who live here now do not know how to lai on stone upon anoth
and these hut ar so wonderfulli construct that though thei must
have stood for ag not a stone of them had fallen but i can show you
the quarri where the marbl wa cut it is close by and behind it is the
entranc to an ancient mine which my father think wa a silver mine
perhap the peopl who work the mine built the marbl hut the
world is old and no doubt plenti of peopl have live in it and been
forgotten
kraal of a somewhat similar natur to those describ
by mr quatermain have been discov in the marico
district of the transvaal and an illustr of them is to
be found in mr anderson twentyf year in a waggon
vol ii p 55 mr anderson sai in thi district ar the
ancient stone kraal mention in an earli chapter but it
requir a fuller descript to show that these extens
kraal must have been erect by a white race who understood
build in stone and at right angl with doorpost
lintel and sill and it requir more than kaffir skill
to erect the stone hut with stone circular roof
beautifulli form and most substanti erect strong
enough if not disturb to last a thousand year
editor
then we rode on in silenc i have seen mani beauti sight in africa
and in such matter as in other comparison ar odiou and worthless
but i do not think that i ever saw a loveli scene it wa no on
thingit wa the combin of the mighti peak look forth on to the
everlast plain the great cliff the waterfal that sparkl
in rainbow hue the river girdl the rich cultiv land the
goldspeck green of the orang tree the flash dome of the marbl
hut and a thousand other thing then over all brood the peac of
even and the infinit glori of the sunset that fill heaven with
chang hue of splendour that wrap the mountain and cliff in
cloak of purpl and of gold and lai upon the quiet face of the water
like the smile of a god
perhap also the contrast and the memori of those three aw dai
and night in the hopeless desert enhanc the charm and perhap the
beauti of the girl who walk besid me complet it for of thi i am
sure that of all sweet and love thing that i look on then she wa
the sweetest and the loveliest
ah it did not take me long to find my fate how long will it be befor
i find her onc again
chapter viii
the marbl kraal
at length the last platform or terrac wa reach and we pull up
outsid the wall surround the central group of marbl hutsfor so
i must call them for want of a better name our approach had been
observ by a crowd of nativ whose race i have never been abl to
determin accur thei belong to the basutu and peac section
of the bantu peopl rather than to the zulu and warlik sever of
these ran up to take the hors gaze on us with astonish not
unmix with aw we dismountedspeak for myself not without
difficultyinde had it not been for stella support i should have
fallen
now you must come and see my father she said i wonder what he will
think of it it is all so strang hendrika take the child to my hut
and give her milk then put her into my bed i will come present
hendrika went off with a somewhat ugli grin to do her mistresss
bid and stella led the wai through the narrow gatewai in the marbl
wall which mai have enclos nearli half an erf or threequart of

ha the appear of have been sedul prick with a pin stella
open it and we enter the interior of the hut wa the size of a
larg and lofti room the wall be form of plain polish marbl
it wa light somewhat dimli but quit effect by peculiar
open in the roof from which the rain wa exclud by overhang
eav the marbl floor wa strewn with nativ mat and skin of
anim bookcas fill with book were place against the wall
there wa a tabl in the centr chair seat with rimpi or strip of
hide stood about and beyond the tabl wa a couch on which a man wa

that you had lost yourself again

let us go out and i will show you our home
i rose and went to my sleepingplac to fetch my hat when i return
mr carsonfor after all that wa hi name though he would never allow
it to be spokenhad come into the hut he felt better now he said and
would accompani us on our walk if stella would give him an arm
so we start and after us came hendrika with tota and old indabazimbi
whom i found sit outsid as fresh as paint noth could tire that
old man
the view from the platform wa almost as beauti as that from the
lower ground look up to the peak the marbl kraal as i have said
face west consequ all the upper terrac lai in the shadow of the
great peak till nearli eleven oclock in the morninga great advantag
in that warm latitud first we walk through the garden which wa
beautifulli cultiv and on of the most product that i ever saw
there were three or four nativ work in it and thei all salut
my host as baba or father then we visit the other two group of
marbl hut on of these wa us for stabl and outbuild the
other as storehous the centr hut have been howev turn into
a chapel mr carson wa not ordain but he earnestli tri to convert
the nativ most of whom were refuge who had come to him for shelter
and he had practis the more elementari rite of the church for so long
that i think he began to believ that he realli wa a clergyman for
instanc he alwai marri those of hi peopl who would consent to a
monogam exist and baptiz their children
when we had examin those wonder remain of antiqu the marbl
hut and admir the orang tree the vine and fruit which thrive
like weed in thi marvel soil and climat we descend to the next
platform and saw the farm oper in full swing i think that it
wa the best farm i have ever seen in africa there wa ampl water
for purpos of irrig the grass land below gave pasturag for
hundr of head of cattl and hors and for nativ the peopl were
most industri moreov the whole place wa manag by mr carson on
the cooper system he onli took a tith of the produceinde in
thi land of teem plenti what wa he to do with more consequ
the tribesmen who by the wai call themselv the children of
thoma were abl to accumul consider wealth all their disput
were refer to their father and he also wa judg of offenc and
crime some were punish by imprison whip and loss of good
other and graver transgress by expuls from the commun a fiat
which to on of these favour nativ must have seem as heavi as the
decre that drove adam from the garden of eden
old mr carson lean upon hi daughter arm and contempl the scene
with pride
i have done all thi allan quatermain he said when renounc
civil i wander here by chanc seek a home in the remotest
place of the world i found thi lone spot a wilder noth
wa to be seen except the site the dome of the marbl hut and the
waterfal i took possess of the hut i clear the path of garden
land and plant the orang grove i had onli six nativ then but by
degre other join me now my tribe is a thousand strong here we
live in profound peac and plenti i have all i need and i seek no
more heaven ha prosper me so farmai it do so to the end which for
me draw nigh and now i am tire and will go back if you wish to see
the old quarri and the mouth of the ancient mine stella will show them
to you no my love you need not troubl to come i can manag look
some of the headmen ar wait to see me
so he went but still follow by hendrika and indabazimbi we turn
and walk along the bank of on of the river pass up behind the
marbl kraal and came to the quarri whenc the materi of which thei
were built had been cut in some remot ag the pit open up a veri
thick seam of the whitest and most beauti marbl i know anoth
like it in natal but by whom it had been work i cannot sai not
by nativ that is certain though the builder of these kraal had
condescend to borrow the shape of nativ hut for their model by
the wai the onli relic of those builder that i ever saw wa a highli
finish bronz pickax which stella had found on dai in the quarri
after we had examin thi quarri we climb the slope of the hill
till we came to the mouth of the ancient mine which were situat in a
gorg i believ them to have been silver mine the gorg wa long and
narrow and the moment we enter it there rose from everi side a sound
of groan and bark that wa almost enough to deafen us i knew what
it wa at onc the whole place wa fill with baboon which clamber
down the rock toward us from everi direct and in a manner that
struck me as be unnatur fearless stella turn a littl pale and
clung to my arm
it is veri silli of me she whisper i am not at all nervou but
ever sinc thei kill hendrik i cannot bear the sight of those anim
i alwai think that there is someth human about them
meanwhil the baboon drew nearer talk to each other as thei came
tota began to cry and clung to stella stella clung to me while i
and indabazimbi put as bold a front on the matter as we could onli
hendrika stood look at the brute with an unconcern smile on her
monkei face when the great ap were quit near she suddenli call
aloud instantli thei stop their hideou clamour as though at a word
of command then hendrika address them i can onli describ it so
that is to sai she began to make a nois such as baboon do when thei
convers with each other i have known hottentot and bushmen who said
that thei could talk with the baboon and understand their languag but
i confess i never heard it done befor or sinc
from the mouth of hendrika came a success of grunt groan
squeal click and everi other abomin nois that can be conceiv
convei to my mind a gener idea of expostul at ani rate the
baboon listen on of them grunt back some answer and then the
whole mob drew off to the rock
i stood astonish and without a word we turn back to the kraal for
hendrika wa too close to allow me to speak when we reach the dine
hut stella went in follow by hendrika but indabazimbi pluck me by
the sleev and i stop outsid
macumazahn he said baboonwomandevilwoman be care
macumazahn she love that star the nativ aptli enough call stella
the star and is jealou be care macumazahn or the star will
set
chapter ix
let us go in allan
it is veri difficult for me to describ the period of time which elaps
between my arriv at babyan peak and my marriag with stella when i
look back on it it seem sweet as with the odour of flower and dim
as with the happi dusk of summer ev while through the sweet come
the sound of stella voic and through the gloom shine the starlight
of her ey i think that we love each other from the first though for
a while we said no word of love dai by dai i went about the place with
her accompani by littl tota and hendrika onli while she attend
to the thousand and on matter which her father evergrow weak
had laid upon her or rather as time drew on i attend to the
busi and she accompani me all dai through we were togeth then
after supper when the night had fallen we would walk togeth in the
garden and come at length to hear her father read aloud sometim from
the work of a poet sometim from histori or if he did not feel
well stella would read and when thi wa done mr carson would
celebr a short form of prayer and we would separ till the morn
onc more brought our happi hour of meet
so the week went by and with everi week i grew to know my darl
better often i wonder now if my fond fanci deceiv me or if inde
there ar women as sweet and dear as she wa it solitud that had given
such depth and gentl to her wa it the long year of commun
with natur that had endow her with such peculiar grace the grace we
find in open flower and bud tree had she caught that murmur
voic from the sound of the stream which fall continu about her
rocki home wa it the tender of the even sky beneath which she
love to walk that lai like a shadow on her face and the light of the
even star that shone in her quiet ey at the least to me she wa
the realiz of that dream which haunt the sleep of sinstain men
so my memori paint her so i hope to find her when at last the sleep
ha roll awai and the fever dream ar done
at last there came a dayth most bless of my life when we told our
love we had been togeth all the morn but after dinner mr carson
wa so unwel that stella stop in with him at supper we met again
and after supper when she had put littl tota to whom she had grown
much attach to bed we went out leav mr carson doze on the
couch
the night wa warm and love and without speak we walk up the
garden to the orang grove and sat down upon a rock there wa a littl
breez which shook the petal of the orang bloom over us in shower
and bore their delic fragranc far and wide silenc reign around
broken onli by the sound of the fall waterfal that now di to a
faint murmur and now as the waver breez turn boom loudli
in our ear the moon wa not yet visibl but alreadi the dark cloud
which float through the sky abov usfor there had been rainshow
a glow of silver tell us that she shone brightli behind the peak
stella began to talk in her low gentl voic speak to me of her
life in the wilder how she had grown to love it how her mind had
gone on from idea to idea and how she pictur the great rush world
that she had never seen as it wa reflect to her from the book which
she had read it wa a curiou vision of life that she had thing were
out of proport to it it wa more like a dream than a realitya
mirag than the actual face of thing the idea of great citi and
especi of london had a kind of fascin for her she could
scarc realiz the rush the roar and hurri the hard crowd of men
and women stranger to each other feverishli seek for wealth and
pleasur beneath a murki sky and tread on anoth down in the furi
of their competit
what is it all for she ask earnestli what do thei seek have so
few year to live why do thei wast them thu
i told her that in the major of instanc it wa actual hard
necess that drove them on but she could bare understand me live
as she had done in the midst of the teem plenti of a fruit earth
she did not seem to be abl to grasp the fact that there were million
who from dai to dai know not how to stai their hunger
i never want to go there she went on i should be bewild and
frighten to death it is not natur to live like that god put adam
and ev in a garden and that is how he meant their children to livein
peac and look alwai on beauti thing thi is my idea of
perfect life i want no other
i thought you onc told me that you found it lone i said
so i did she answer innoc but that wa befor you came now
i am not lone ani more and it is perfectperfect as the night
just then the full moon rose abov the elbow of the peak and her
rai stole far and wide down the misti vallei gleam on the water
brood on the plain search out the hidden place of the rock
wrap the fair form of natur as in a silver bridal veil through
which her beauti shone mysteri
stella look down the terrac vallei she turn and look up at the
scar face of the golden moon and then she look at me the beauti
of the night wa about her face the scent of the night wa on her hair
the mysteri of the night shone in her shadow ey she look at me i
look on her and all our heart love blossom within us we spoke no
wordw had no word to speak but slowli we drew near till lip were
press to lip as we kiss our etern troth
it wa she who broke that holi silenc speak in a chang voic
in soft deep note that thrill me like the lowest chord of a smitten
harp
ah now i understand she said now i know why we ar lone and how
we can lose our loneli now i know what it is that stir us in the
beauti of the sky in the sound of water and in the scent of flower
it is love who speak in everyth though till we hear hi voic we
understand noth but when we hear then the riddl is answer and
the gate of our heart ar open and allan we see the wai that wend
through death to heaven and is lost in the glori of which our love is
but a shadow
let us go in allan let us go befor the spell break so that
whatev overtak us sorrow death or separ we mai alwai have
thi perfect memori to save us come dearest let us go
i rose like a man in a dream still hold her by the hand but as i
rose my ey fell upon someth that gleam white among the foliag
of the orang bush at my side i said noth but look the breez
stir the orang leav the moonlight struck for a moment full upon
the white object
it wa the face of hendrika the babyanwoman as indabazimbi had
call her and on it wa a glare of hate that made me shudder
i said noth the face vanish and just then i heard a baboon bark
in the rock behind
then we went down the garden and stella pass into the centr hut i
saw hendrika stand in the shadow near the door and went up to her
hendrika i said why were you watch miss stella and myself in the
garden
she drew her lip up till her teeth gleam in the moonlight
have i not watch her these mani year macumazahn shall i ceas to
watch becaus a wander white man come to steal her why were you
kiss her in the garden macumazahn how dare you kiss her who is a
star
i kiss her becaus i love her and becaus she love me i answer
what ha that to do with you hendrika
becaus you love her she hiss in answer and do i not love her
also who save me from the babyan i am a woman as she is and you ar
a man and thei sai in the kraal that men love women better than women
love women but it is a lie though thi is true that if a woman love
a man she forget all other love have i not seen it i gather her
flowersbeauti flower i climb the rock where you would never dare
to go to find them you pluck a piec of orang bloom in the garden and
give it to her what doe she dosh take the orang bloom she put
it in her breast and let my flower die i call to hersh doe not
hear mesh is think you whisper to some on far awai and she
hear and smile she us to kiss me sometim now she kiss that
white brat you brought becaus you brought it oh i see it allal i
have seen it from the first you ar steal her from us steal her
to yourself and those who love her befor you came ar forgotten be
care macumazahn be care lest i am reveng upon you you you
hate me you think me half a monkei that servant of your call me
baboonwoman well i have live with baboon and thei ar clevery
thei can plai trick and know thing that you dont and i am clever
than thei for i have learnt the wisdom of white peopl also and i sai
to you walk softli macumazahn or you will fall into a pit and with
on more look of malic she wa gone
i stood for a moment reflect i wa afraid of thi strang creatur
who seem to combin the cun of the great ap that had rear
her with the passion and skill of human kind i forebod evil at her
hand and yet there wa someth almost touch in the fierc of
her jealousi it is gener suppos that thi passion onli exist in
strength when the object love is of anoth sex from the lover but i
confess that both in thi instanc and in some other which i have met
with thi ha not been my experi i have known men and especi
uncivil men who were as jealou of the affect of their friend
or master as ani lover could be of that of hi mistress and who ha
not seen case of the same thing where parent and their children ar
concern but the lower on get in the scale of human the more
readili thi passion thrive inde it mai be said to come to it
intensest perfect in brute women ar more jealou than men
smallheart men ar more jealou than those of larger mind and wider
sympathi and anim ar the most jealou of all now hendrika wa in
some wai not far remov from anim which mai perhap account for the
feroc of her jealousi of her mistresss affect
shake off my presenti of evil i enter the centr hut mr
carson wa rest on the sofa and by him knelt stella hold hi
hand and her head rest on hi breast i saw at onc that she had
been tell him of what had come about between us nor wa i sorri
for it is a task that a wouldb soninlaw is gener glad to do by
deputi
come here allan quatermain he said almost sternli and my heart
gave a jump for i fear lest he might be about to requir me to go
about my busi but i came
stella tell me he went on that you two have enter into a
marriag engag she tell me also that she love you and that you
sai that you love her
i do inde sir i broke in i love her truli if ever a woman wa
love in thi world i love her
i thank heaven for it said the old man listen my children mani
year ago a great shame and sorrow fell upon me so great a sorrow that
as i sometim think it affect my brain at ani rate i determin
to do what most men would have consid the act of a madman to go far
awai into the wilder with my onli child there to live remot from
civil and it evil i did so i found thi place and here we
have live for mani year happili enough and perhap not without do
good in our gener but still in a wai unnatur to our race and
statu at first i thought i would let my daughter grow up in a state of
complet ignor that she should be natur child but as time went
on i saw the folli and the wicked of my plan i had no right to
degrad her to the level of the savag around me for if the fruit
of the tree of knowledg is a bitter fruit still it teach good from
evil so i educ her as well as i wa abl till in the end i knew
that in mind as in bodi she wa in no wai inferior to her sister the
children of the civil world she grew up and enter into womanhood
and then it came into my mind that i wa do her a bitter wrong that
i wa separ her from her kind and keep her in a wilder where
she could find neither mate nor companion but though i knew thi i
could not yet make up my mind to return to activ life i had grown to
love thi place i dread to return into the world i had abjur again
and again i put my resolut asid then at the commenc of thi
year i fell ill for a while i wait hope that i might get better
but at last i realiz that i should never get better that the hand of
death wa upon me
ah no father not that stella said with a cry
ye love that and it is true now you will be abl to forget our
separ in the happi of a new meet and he glanc at me
and smile well when thi knowledg came home to me i determin to
abandon thi place and trek for the coast though i well knew that
the journei would kill me i should never live to reach it but stella
would and it would be better than leav her here alon with savag
in the wilder on the veri dai that i had made up my mind to take
thi step stella found you dy in the bad land allan quatermain and
brought you here she brought you of all men in the world you whose
father had been my dear friend and who onc with your babi hand had
save her life from fire that she might live to save your from thirst
at the time i said littl but i saw the hand of provid in thi and
i determin to wait and see what came about between you at the worst
if noth came about i soon learn that i could trust you to see her
safe to the coast after i wa gone but mani dai ago i knew how it
stood between you and now thing ar determin as i prai thei might
be god bless you both my children mai you be happi in your love
mai it endur till death and beyond it god bless you both and he
stretch out hi hand toward me
i took it and stella kiss him
present he spoke again
it is my intent he said if you two consent to marri you next
sundai i wish to do so soon for i do not know how much longer will be
allow to me i believ that such a ceremoni solemnli celebr
and enter into befor wit will under the circumst be
perfectli legal but of cours you will repeat it with everi formal
the first moment it li in your power so to do and now there is
on more thing when i left england my fortun were in a shatter
condit in the cours of year thei have recov themselv
the accumul rent as i heard but recent when the waggon last
return from port natal have suffic to pai off all charg and
there is a consider balanc over consequ you will not marri on
noth for of cours you stella ar my heiress and i wish to make
a stipul it is thi that so soon as my death occur you should
leav thi place and take the first opportun of return to england
i do not ask you to live there alwai it might prove too much for
peopl rear in the wild as both of you have been but i do ask you
to make it your perman home do you consent and promis thi
i do i answer
and so do i said stella
veri well he answer and now i am tire out again god bless you
both and goodnight
chapter x
hendrika plot evil
on the follow morn i had a convers with indabazimbi first
of all i told him that i wa go to marri stella
oh he said i thought so macumazahn did i not tell you that you
would find happi on thi journei most men must be content to watch
the star from a long wai off to you it is given to wear her on your
heart but rememb macumazahn rememb that star set
can you not stop your croak even for a dai i answer angrili
for hi word sent a thrill of fear through me
a true prophet must tell the ill as well as the good macumazahn i
onli speak what is on my mind but what of it what is life but loss
loss upon loss till life itself be lost but in death we mai find all
the thing that we have lost so your father taught macumazahn and
there wa wisdom in hi gentl ou i do not believ in death it is
chang that is all macumazahn look now the rain fall the drop of
rain that were on water in the cloud fall side by side thei sink into
the ground present the sun will come out the earth will be dry the
drop will be gone a fool look and sai the drop ar dead thei will
never be on again thei will never again fall side by side but i am a
rainmak and i know the wai of rain it is not true the drop will
drain by mani path into the river and will be on water there thei
will go up to the cloud again in the mist of morn and there will
again be as thei have been we ar the drop of rain macumazahn when
we fall that is our life when we sink into the ground that is death
and when we ar drawn up again to the sky what is that macumazahn no
no when we find we lose and when we seem to lose then we shall realli
find i am not a christian macumazahn but i am old and have watch
and seen thing that perhap christian do not see there i have
spoken be happi with your star and if it set wait macumazahn wait
till it rise again it will not be long on dai you will go to sleep
then your ey will open on anoth sky and there your star will be
shine macumazahn
i made no answer at the time i could not bear to talk of such a thing
but often and often in the after year i have thought of indabazimbi
and hi beauti simil and gather comfort from it he wa a strang
man thi old rainmak savag and there wa more wisdom in him than
in mani learn atheiststhos spiritu destroy who in the name
of progress and human would divorc hope from life and leav us
wander in a lonesom selfconsecr hell
indabazimbi i said chang the subject i have someth to sai
and i told him of the threat of hendrika
he listen with an unmov face nod hi white lock at interv as
the narr went on but i saw that he wa disturb by it
macumazahn he said at length i have told you that thi is an evil
woman she wa nourish on baboon milk and the baboon natur is in
her vein such creatur should be kill not kept she will make you
mischief if she can but i will watch her macumazahn look the star is
wait for you go or she will hate me as hendrika hate you
so i went noth loth for attract as wa the wisdom of
indabazimbi i found a deeper mean in stella simplest word all
the rest of that dai i pass in her compani and the greater part of
the two follow dai at last came saturdai night the ev of our
marriag it rain that night so we did not go out but spent the
even in the hut we sat hand in hand sai littl but mr carson
talk a good deal tell us tale of hi youth and of countri
that he had visit then he read aloud from the bibl and bade us
goodnight i also kiss stella and went to bed i reach my hut by
the cover wai and befor i undress open the door to see what the
night wa like it wa veri dark and rain wa still fall but as
the light stream out into the gloom i fanci that i caught sight of
a duski form glide awai the thought of hendrika flash into my mind
could she be skulk about outsid there now i had said noth of
hendrika and her threat either to mr carson or stella becaus i did
not wish to alarm them also i knew that stella wa attach to thi
strang person and i did not wish to shake her confid in her unless
it wa absolut necessari for a minut or two i stood hesit
then reflect that if it wa hendrika there she should stop i went
in and put up the stout wooden bar that wa us to secur the door for
the last few night old indabazimbi had made a habit of sleep in the
cover passag which wa the onli other possibl wai of access as i
came to bed i had step over him roll up in hi blanket and to all
appear fast asleep so it be evid that i had noth to fear
i promptli dismiss the matter from my mind which as mai be imagin
wa inde fulli occupi with other thought
i got into bed and for awhil lai awak think of the great happi
in store for me and of the providenti cours of event that had
brought it within my reach a few week sinc and i wa wander in
the desert a dy man bear a dy child and with scarc a
possess left in the world except a store of buri ivori that i never
expect to see again and now i wa about to wed on of the sweetest
and loveliest women on the whole eartha woman whom i love more than
i could have thought possibl and who love me back again also as
though that were not good fortun enough i wa to acquir with her
veri consider possess quit suffici larg to enabl us to
follow ani plan of life we found agreeabl as i lai and reflect on
all thi i grew afraid of my good fortun old indabazimbi melancholi
propheci came into my mind hitherto he had alwai prophesi truli
what if these should be true also i turn cold as i thought of it and
prai to the power abov to preserv us both to live and love togeth
never wa prayer more need while it word were still upon my lip i
drop asleep and dream a most dread dream
i dream that stella and i were stand togeth to be marri
she wa dress in white and radiant with beauti but it wa a wild
spiritu beauti which frighten me her ey shone like star a pale
flame plai about her featur and the wind that blew did not stir her
hair nor wa thi all for her white robe were death wrap and
the altar at which we stood wa form of the piledup earth from an
open grave that yawn between us so we stood wait for on to wed
us but no on came present from the open grave sprang the form of
hendrika in her hand wa a knife with which she stab at me but
pierc the heart of stella who without a cry fell backward into the
grave still look at me as she fell then hendrika leap after her
into the grave i heard her feet strike heavili
awak macumazahn awak cri the voic of indabazimbi
i awok and bound from the bed a cold perspir pour from me
in the dark on the other side of the hut i heard sound of furiou
struggl luckili i kept my head just by me wa a chair on which were
match and a rush taper i struck a match and held it to the taper now
in the grow light i could see two form roll on over the other on
the floor and from between them came the flash of steel the fat melt
and the light burnt up it wa indabazimbi and the woman hendrika who
were struggl and what is more the woman wa get the better of
the man strong as he wa i rush toward them now she wa uppermost
now she had wrench herself from hi fierc grip and now the great
knife she had in her hand flash up
but i wa behind her and place my hand beneath her arm jerk
with all my strength she fell backward and in her effort to save
herself most fortun drop the knife then we flung ourselv
upon her heaven the strength of that shedevil nobodi who ha not
experienc it could believ it she fought and scratch and bit
and at on time nearli master the two of us as it wa she did break
loos she rush at the bed sprung on it and bound thenc straight
up at the roof of the hut i never saw such a jump and could not
conceiv what she meant to do in the roof were the peculiar hole which
i have describ thei were design to admit light and cover with
overhang eav she sprung straight and true like a monkei and
catch the edg of the hole with her hand strove to draw herself
through it but here her strength exhaust with the long struggl
fail her for a moment she swung then drop to the ground and fell
senseless
ou gasp indabazimbi let us tie the devil up befor she come to
life again
i thought thi a good counsel so we took a reim that lai in the corner
of the room and lash her hand and feet in such a fashion that even
she could scarc escap then we carri her into the passag and
indabazimbi sat over her the knife in hi hand for i did not wish to
rais an alarm at that hour of the night
do you know how i caught her macumazahn he said for sever night
i have slept here with on ey open for i thought she had made a plan
tonight i kept wide awak though i pretend to be asleep an hour
after you got into the blanket the moon rose and i saw a beam of light
come into the hut through the hole in the roof present i saw the beam
of light vanish at first i thought that a cloud wa pass over the
moon but i listen and heard a nois as though some on wa squeez
himself through a narrow space present he wa through and hang by
hi hand then the light came in again and in the middl of it i saw
the babyanfrau swing from the roof and about to drop into the
hut she clung by both hand and in her mouth wa a great knife she
drop and i ran forward to seiz her as she drop and grip her
round the middl but she heard me come and seiz the knife struck
at me in the dark and miss me then we struggl and you know the
rest you were veri nearli dead tonight macumazahn
veri nearli inde i answer still pant and arrang the rag
of my nightdress round me as best i might then the memori of my horrid
dream flash into my mind doubtless it had been conjur up by the
sound of hendrika drop to the floorin my dream it had been a grave
that she drop into all of it then had been experienc in that
second of time well dream ar swift perhap time itself is noth
but a dream and event that seem far apart realli occur simultan
we pass the rest of the night watch hendrika present she came
to herself and struggl furious to break the reim but the untan
buffalo hide wa too strong even for her and moreov indabazimbi
unceremoni sat upon her to keep her quiet at last she gave it up
in due cours the dai brokemi marriag dai leav indabazimbi to
watch my wouldb murderess i went and fetch some nativ from the
stabl and with their aid bore hendrika to the prison hutthat
same hut in which she had been confin when she had been brought
a baboonchild from the rock here we shut her up and leav
indabazimbi to watch outsid i return to my sleepingplac and
dress in the best garment that the babyan kraal could furnish but
when i look at the reflect of my face i wa horrifi it wa
cover with scratch inflict by the nail of hendrika i doctor
them up as best i could then went out for a walk to calm my nerv
which what between the event of the past night and of those pend
that dai were not a littl disturb
when i return it wa breakfast time i went into the dine hut and
there stella wa wait to greet me dress in simpl white and with
orang flower on her breast she came forward to me shyli enough then
see the condit of my face start back
why allan what have you been do to yourself she ask
as i wa about to answer her father came in lean on hi stick and
catch sight of me instantli ask the same question
then i told them everyth both of hendrika threat and of her
fierc attempt to carri them into execut but i did not tell my
horrid dream
stella face grew white as the flower on her breast but that of her
father becam veri stern
you should have spoken of thi befor allan he said i now see that
i did wrong to attempt to civil thi wick and reveng creatur
who if she is human ha all the evil passion of the brute that
rear her well i will make an end of it thi veri dai
oh father said stella dont have her kill it is all dread
enough but that would be more dread still i have been veri fond of
her and bad as she is she ha love me do not have her kill on my
marriag dai
no her father answer she shall not be kill for though she
deserv to die i will not have her blood upon our hand she is a
brute and ha follow the natur of brute she shall go back whenc

no more wa said on the matter at the time but when breakfastwhich
wa rather a farcewa done mr carson sent for hi headman and gave
him certain order
we were to be marri after the servic which mr carson held everi
sundai morn in the larg marbl hut set apart for that purpos the
servic began at ten oclock but long befor that hour all the nativ
on the place came up in troop sing as thei came to be present at
the wed of the star it wa a pretti sight to see them the men
dress in all their fineri and carri shield and stick in their
hand and the women and children bear green branch of tree
fern and flower at length about halfpast nine stella rose
press my hand and left me to my reflect a few minut to ten she
reappear again with her father dress in a white veil a wreath of
orang flower on her dark curl hair a bouquet of orang flower
in her hand to me she seem like a dream of loveli with her came
littl tota in a high state of glee and excit she wa stella
onli bridesmaid then we all pass out toward the church hut the bare
space in front of it wa fill with hundr of nativ who set up
a song as we came but we went on into the hut which wa crowd with
such of the nativ as usual worship there here mr carson as
usual read the servic though he wa oblig to sit down in order to
do so when it wa doneand to me it seem interminablemr carson
whisper that he meant to marri us outsid the hut in sight of all the
peopl so we went out and took our stand under the shade of a larg
tree that grew near the hut face the bare space where the nativ were
gather
mr carson held up hi hand to enjoin silenc then speak in the
nativ dialect he told them that he wa about to make us man and wife

of god and man for all that is necessari to make a marriag bind
is that it should be celebr accord to the custom of the countri

rob him of hi life which is a littl thing compar to that which i
have lost at hi hand i have fail and i am sorri for it for had i

never murmur stella in my ear but mr carson turn white with
wrath

she pai me back me and my daughter whom she swear she love she sai
that she would have murder a man who ha done her no evil the man who

death repeat the head induna ad if you save her my
father we will slai her with our own hand she is a babyanwoman a
devilwoman ah ye we have heard of such befor let her be slain

herself she said that i whose life had been attempt forgav her
and she my wife who had nearli been left a widow befor she wa made a

now her father listen readili enough for he had no intent of
kill hendrikainde he had alreadi promis not to do so but the
peopl were in a differ humour thei look upon hendrika as a devil
and would have torn her to piec there and then could thei have had
their wai nor were matter mend by indabazimbi who had alreadi
gain a great reput for wisdom and magic in the place suddenli
the old man rose and made quit an impass speech urg them to
kill hendrika at onc or mischief would come of it
at last matter got veri bad for two of the induna came forward to
drag her off to execut and it wa not until stella burst into tear
that the sight of her grief back by mr carson order and my own
remonstr carri the dai
all thi while hendrika had been stand quit unmov at last the
tumult ceas and the lead induna call to her to go promis
that if ever she show her face near the kraal again she should be
stab like a jackal then hendrika spoke to stella in a low voic and
in english

stella did not answer and thei loos her she step forward and
look at the nativ with a stare of hate then she turn and walk
past me and as she pass whisper a nativ phrase in my ear that

the same signific as the french au revoir
it frighten me for i knew she meant that she had not done with me
and saw that our merci wa misplac see my face chang she ran
swiftli from me and as she pass indabazimbi with a sudden movement
snatch her great knife from hi hand when she had gone about twenti
pace she halt look long and earnestli on stella gave on loud cry
of anguish and fled a few minut later we saw her far awai bound
up the face of an almost perpendicular cliffa cliff that nobodi except
herself and the baboon could possibl climb
look said indabazimbi in my earlook macumazahn there goe the
babyanfrau but macumazahn she will come back again ah why
will you not listen to my word have thei not alwai been true word
macumazahn and he shrug hi shoulder and turn awai
for a while i wa much disturb but at ani rate hendrika wa gone for
the present and stella my dear and love wife wa there at my side
and in her smile i forgot my fear
for the rest of that dai why should i write of itther ar thing
too happi and too sacr to be written of
at last i had if onli for a littl while found that rest that perfect
joi which we seek so continu and so rare clasp
chapter xi
gone
i wonder if mani marri coupl ar quit as happi as we found
ourselv cynic a grow class declar that few illus can
surviv a honeymoon well i do not know about it for i onli marri
onc and can but speak from my limit experi but certainli our
illus or rather the great truth of which it is the shadow did
surviv as to thi dai it surviv in my heart across all the year of
utter separ and across the unansw gulf of gloom
but complet happi is not allow in thi world even for an hour
as our marriag dai had been shadow by the scene which ha been
describ so our marri life wa shadow by it own sorrow
three dai after our wed mr carson had a stroke it had been long
impend now it fell we came into the centr hut to dinner and found
him ly speechless on the couch at first i thought that he wa dy
but thi wa not so on the contrari within four dai he recov hi
speech and some power of movement but he never recov hi memori
though he still knew stella and sometim myself curious enough he
rememb littl tota best of all three though occasion he thought
that she wa hi own daughter in her childhood and would ask her where
her mother wa thi state of affair last for some seven month
the old man gradual grew weaker but he did not die of cours hi
condit quit preclud the idea of our leav babyan kraal till all
wa over thi wa the more distress to me becaus i had a nervou
presenti that stella wa incur danger by stai there and also
becaus the state of her health render it desir that we should
reach a civil region as soon as possibl howev it could not be
help
at length the end came veri suddenli we were sit on even by
mr carson bedsid in hi hut when to our astonish he sat up and
spoke in a strong full voic
i hear you he said ye ye i forgiv you poor woman you too
have suffer and he fell back dead
i have littl doubt that he wa address hi lost wife some vision
of whom had flash across hi dy sens stella of cours wa
overwhelm with grief at her loss till i came her father had been her
sole companion and therefor as mai be imagin the tie between them
wa much closer than is usual even in the case of father and daughter
so deepli did she mourn that i began to fear for the effect upon her
health nor were we the onli on to griev all the nativ on the
settlement call mr carson father and as a father thei lament
him the air resound with the wail of women and the men went about
with bow head sai that the sun had set in the heaven now onli
the star stella remain indabazimbi alon did not mourn he said
that it wa best that the inkoo should die for what wa life worth
when on lai like a logmoreov that it would have been well for all
if he had di sooner
on the follow dai we buri him in the littl graveyard near the
waterfal it wa a sad busi and stella cri veri much in spite
of all i could do to comfort her
that night as i sat outsid the hut smokingfor the weather wa hot
and stella wa ly down insideold indabazimbi came up salut and
squat at my feet
what is it indabazimbi i said
thi macumazahn when ar you go to trek toward the coast
i dont know i answer the star is not fit to travel now we must
wait awhil
no macumazahn you must not wait you must go and the star must take
her chanc she is strong it is noth all will be well
why do you sai so why must we go
for thi reason macumazahn and he look cautious round and spoke
low the baboon have come back in thousand all the mountain is full
of them
i did not know that thei had gone i said
ye he answer thei went after the marriag all but on or two
now thei ar back all the baboon in the world i think i saw a whole
cliff back with them
is that all i said for i saw that he had someth behind i am not
afraid of a pack of baboon
no macumazahn it is not all the babyanfrau hendrika is with
them
now noth had been heard or seen of hendrika sinc her expuls and
though at first she and her threat had haunt me somewhat by degre
she to a great extent had pass out of my mind which wa fulli
preoccupi with stella and my fatherinlaw ill i start
violent how do you know thi i ask
i know it becaus i saw her macumazahn she is disguis she is
dress up in baboon skin and her face is stain dark but though she
wa a long wai off i knew her by her size and i saw the white flesh
of her arm when the skin slip asid she ha come back macumazahn
with all the baboon in the world and she ha come back to do evil now
do you understand why you should trek
ye i said though i dont see how she and the baboon can harm
us i think that it will be better to go if necessari we can camp the
waggon somewher for a while on the journei hearken indabazimbi sai
noth of thi to the star i will not have her frighten and hearken
again speak to the headmen and see that watcher ar set all round the
hut and garden and kept there night and dai tomorrow we will get
the waggon readi and next dai we will trek
he nod hi white lock and went to do my bid leav me not a
littl disturbedunreason so inde it wa a strang stori that
thi woman had the power of convers with baboon i knew that wa
not so veri wonder see that the bushmen claim to be abl to do
the same thing and she had been nurtur by them but that she had
been abl to muster them and by the strength of her human will and
intellig muster them in order to forward her end of reveng seem
to me so incred that after reflect my fear grew light still i
determin to trek after all a journei in an ox waggon would not be
such a veri terribl thing to a strong woman accustom to rough it
whatev her state of health and when all wa said and done i did
not like thi tale of the presenc of hendrika with countless host of
baboon
for an instanc of thi see anderson twentyf
year in a waggon vol i p 262editor
so i went in to stella and without sai a word to her of the baboon
stori told her i had been think matter over and had come to the
conclus that it wa our duti to follow her father instruct to
the letter and leav babyan kraal at onc into all our talk i need
not enter but the end of it wa that she agre with me and declar
that she could quit well manag the journei sai moreov that now
that her dear father wa dead she would be glad to get awai
noth happen to disturb us that night and on the follow morn
i wa up earli make prepar the despair of the peopl when thei
learn that we were go to leav them wa someth quit pitiabl i
could onli consol them by declar that we were but on a journei and
would return the follow year
thei had live in the shadow of their father who wa dead thei
declar ever sinc thei were littl thei had live in hi shadow he
had receiv them when thei were outcast and wander without a mat
to lie on or a blanket to cover them and thei had grown fat in hi
shadow then he had di and the star their father daughter had
marri me macumazahn and thei had believ that i should take their
father place and let them live in my shadow what should thei do when
there wa no on to protect them the tribe were kept from attack
them by fear of the white man if we went thei would be eaten up and
so on ala there wa but too much foundat for their fear
i return to the hut at middai to get some dinner stella said
that she wa go to pack dure the afternoon so i did not think it
necessari to caution her about go out alon as i did not wish to
allud to the subject of hendrika and the baboon unless i wa oblig
to i told her howev that i would come back to help her as soon as
i could get awai then i went down to the nativ kraal to sort out such
cattl as had belong to mr carson from those which belong to the
kaffir for i propos to take them with us it wa a larg herd
and the busi took an incalcul time at length a littl befor
sundown i gave it up and leav indabazimbi to finish the job got
on my hors and rode homeward
arriv i gave the hors to on of the stabl boi and went into the
central hut there wa no sign of stella though the thing she had
been pack lai about the floor i pass first into our sleep hut
thenc on by on into all the other but still saw no sign of her
then i went out and call to a kaffir in the garden ask him if he
had seen hi mistress
he answer ye he had seen her carri flower and walk toward
the graveyard hold the littl white girlmi daughtera he call
her by the hand when the sun stood there and he point to a spot
on the horizon where it would have been about an hour and a half befor
the two dog were with them he ad i turn and ran toward the
graveyard which wa about a quarter of a mile from the hut of cours
there wa no reason to be anxiousevid she had gone to lai the
flower on her father grave and yet i wa anxiou
when i got near the graveyard i met on of the nativ who by my
order had been set round the kraal to watch the place and notic
that he wa rub hi ey and yawn clearli he had been asleep i
ask him if he had seen hi mistress and he answer that he had not
which under the circumst wa not wonder without stop
to reproach him i order the man to follow me and went on to the
graveyard there on mr carson grave lai the droop flower which
stella had been carri and there in the fresh mould wa the spoor of
tota veldschoon or hide slipper but where were thei
i ran from the graveyard and call aloud at the top of my voic but no
answer came meanwhil the nativ wa more profit engag in trace
their spoor he follow it for about a hundr yard till he came to
a clump of mimosa bush that wa situat between the stream and the
ancient marbl quarri just over the waterfal and at the mouth of the
ravin here he stop and i heard him give a startl cry i rush
to the spot pass through the tree and saw thi the littl open
space in the centr of the glade had been the scene of a struggl
there in the soft earth were the mark of three pair of human
feettwo shod on nakedstella tota and hendrika nor wa
thi all there close by lai the fragment of the two dogsthei were
noth moreand on baboon not yet quit dead which had been
bitten in the throat by the dog all round wa the spoor of numberless
baboon the full horror of what had happen flash into my mind
my wife and tota had been carri off by the baboon as yet thei had
not been kill for if so their remain would have been found with
those of the dog thei had been carri off the brute act under
the direct of that womanmonkei hendrika had drag them awai to
some secret den there to keep them till thei diedor kill them
for a moment i liter stagger beneath the terror of the shock then
i rous myself from my despair i bade the nativ run and alarm the
peopl at the kraal tell them to come arm and bring me gun and
ammunit he went like the wind and i turn to follow the spoor for
a few yard it wa plain enoughstella had been drag along i could
see where her heel had struck the ground the child had i presum
been carriedat least there were no mark of her feet at the water
edg the spoor vanish the water wa shallow and thei had gone along
in it or at least hendrika and her victim had in order to obliter
the trail i could see where a mossgrown stone had been freshli turn
over in the waterb i ran along the bank some wai up the ravin in
the vain hope of catch a sight of them present i heard a bark in
the cliff abov me it wa answer by anoth and then i saw that
score of baboon were hidden about among the rock on either side and
were softli swing themselv down to bar the path to go on unarm
as i wa would be useless i should onli be torn to piec as the dog
had been so i turn and fled back toward the hut as i drew near i
could see that my messeng had rous the settlement for nativ with
spear and kerri in their hand were run up toward the kraal
when i reach the hut i met old indabazimbi who wore a veri seriou
face
so the evil ha fallen macumazahn he said
it ha fallen i answer
keep a good heart macumazahn he said again she is not dead nor is
the littl maid and befor thei die we shall find them rememb thi
hendrika love her she will not harm her or allow the babyan to harm
her she will try to hide her awai from you that is all
prai god that we mai find her i groan the light is go fast

moonlight it is useless to start now see the sun sink let us get
the men togeth eat and make thing readi hamba gachla hasten

as there wa no help i took hi advic i could eat no food but i
pack some up to take with us and made readi rope and a rough kind
of litter if we found them thei would scarc be abl to walk ah if
we found them how slowli the time pass it seem hour befor the
moon rose but at last it did rise
then we start in all we were about a hundr men but we onli
muster five gun between us my eleph roer and four that had
belong to mr carson
chapter xii
the magic of indabazimbi
we gain the spot by the stream where stella had been taken the
nativ look at the torn fragment of the dog and at the mark of
violenc and i heard them swear to each other that whether the
star live or di thei would not rest till thei had extermin everi
baboon on babyan peak i echo the oath and as shall be seen we
kept it
we start on along the stream follow the spoor of the baboon as we
best could but the stream left no spoor and the hard rocki bank veri
littl still we wander on all night we wander through the lone
moonlit vallei startl the silenc into a thousand echo with our
cri but no answer came to them in vain our ey search the side
of precipic form of waterriven rock fantast pile on
upon anoth in vain we search through endless dell and fernclad
cranni there wa noth to be found how could we expect to find
two human be hidden awai in the recess of thi vast stretch of
mountain ground which no man yet had ever fulli explor thei were
lost and in all human probabl lost for ever
to and fro we wander hopelessli till at last dawn found us footsor
and weari nearli at the spot whenc we had start we sat down wait
for the sun to rise and the men at of such food as thei had brought
with them and sent to the kraal for more
i sat upon a stone with a break heart i cannot describ my feel
let the reader put himself in my posit and perhap he mai get some
idea of them near me wa old indabazimbi who sat stare straight
befor him as though he were look into space and take note of
what went on there an idea struck me thi man had some occult power
sever time dure our adventur he had prophesi and in everi case
hi propheci had prove true he it wa who when we escap from the
zulu impi had told me to steer north becaus there we should find the
place of a white man who live under the shadow of a great peak that wa
full of baboon perhap he could help in thi extremityat ani rate it
wa worth try
indabazimbi i said you sai that you can send your spirit through
the door of space and see what we cannot see at the least i know that
you can do strang thing can you not help me now if you can and will
save her i will give you half the cattl that we have here
i never said anyth of the sort macumazahn he answer i do
thing i do not talk about them neither do i seek reward for what i do
like a common witchdoctor it is well that you have ask me to us my
wisdom macumazahn for i should not have us it again without be
askedno not even for the sake of the star and yourself whom i love
for if so my spirit would have been angri in the other matter i had a
part for my life wa concern as well as your but in thi matter i
have no part and therefor i might not us my wisdom unless you thought
well to call upon my spirit howev it would have been no good to ask
me befor for i have onli just found the herb i want and he produc
a hand of the leav of a plant that wa unfamiliar to me it had
prickli leav shape veri much like those of the common english
nettl
now macumazahn he went on bid the men leav us alon and then
follow me present to the littl glade down there by the water
i did so when i reach the glade i found indabazimbi kindl a small
fire under the shadow of a tree by the edg of the water
sit there macumazahn he said point to a stone near the fire
and do not be surpris or frighten at anyth you see if you move
or call out we shall learn noth
i sat down and watch when the fire wa alight and burn brightli
the old fellow strip himself stark nake and go to the foot of
the pool dip himself in the water then he came back shiver with
the cold and lean over the littl fire thrust leav of the plant
i have mention into hi mouth and began to chew them mutter as he
chew most of the remain leav he threw on to the fire a dens
smoke rose from them but he held hi head in thi smoke and drew
it down hi lung till i saw that he wa exhibit everi sign of
suffoc the vein in hi throat and chest swell he gasp
loudli and hi ey from which tear were stream seem as though
thei were go to start from hi head present he fell over on hi
side and lai senseless i wa terribl alarm and my first impuls
wa to run to hi assist but fortun i rememb hi caution
and sat quiet
indabazimbi lai on the ground like a person quit dead hi limb had
all the utter relax of death but as i watch i saw them begin
to stiffen exactli as though rigor morti had set in then to my
astonish i perceiv them onc more relax and thi time there
appear upon hi chest the stain of decomposit it spread and
spread in three minut the man to all appear wa a livid corps
i sat amaz watch thi uncanni sight and wonder if ani further
natur process wa about to be enact perhap indabazimbi wa
go to fall to dust befor my ey as i watch i observ that
the discolor wa begin to fade first it vanish from the
extrem then from the larger limb and lastli from the trunk
then in turn came the third stage of relax the second stage of
stiff or rigor and the first stage of afterdeath collaps when
all these had rapidli succeed each other indabazimbi quietli woke
up
i wa too astonish to speak i simpli look at him with my mouth
open
well macumazahn he said put hi head on on side like a bird
and nod hi white lock in a comic fashion it is all right i
have seen her
seen who i said
the star your wife and the littl maid thei ar much frighten but
unharm the babyanfrau watch them she is mad but the baboon obei
her and do not hurt them the star wa sleep from weari so i
whisper in her ear and told her not to be frighten for you would
soon rescu her and that meanwhil she must seem to be pleas to have
hendrika near her
you whisper in her ear i said how could you whisper in her ear
bah macumazahn how could i seem to die and go rotten befor your
ey you dont know do you well i will tell you on thing i had to
die to pass the door of space as you call them i had to draw all the
healthi strength and life from my bodi in order to gather power to speak
with the star it wa a danger busi macumazahn for if i had let
thing go a littl further thei must have stop so and there would
have been an end of indabazimbi ah you white men you know so much
that you think you know everyth but you dont you ar alwai
stare at the cloud and cant see the thing that lie at your feet
you hardli believ me now do you macumazahn well i will show you
have you anyth on you that the star ha touch or worn
i thought for a moment and said that i had a lock of her hair in my
pocketbook he told me to give it him i did so go to the fire he
lit the lock of hair in the flame and let it burn to ash which he
caught in hi left hand these ash he mix up in a past with the
juic of on of the leav of the plant i have spoken of
now macumazahn shut your ey he said
i did so and he rub hi past on to my eyelid at first it burnt
me then my head swam strang present thi effect pass off and
my brain wa perfectli clear again but i could not feel the ground with
my feet indabazimbi led me to the side of the stream beneath us wa a
pool of beautifulli clear water
look into the pool macumazahn said indabazimbi and hi voic
sound hollow and far awai in my ear
i look the water grew dark it clear and in it wa a pictur
i saw a cave with a fire burn in it against the wall of the cave
rest stella her dress wa torn almost off her she look dreadfulli
pale and weari and her eyelid were red as though with weep but she
slept and i could almost think that i saw her lip shape my name in her
sleep close to her her head upon stella breast wa littl tota
she had a skin thrown over her to keep out the night cold the child wa
awak and appear to be moan with fear by the fire and in such a
posit that the light fell full upon her face and engag in cook
someth in a rough pot shape from wood sat the baboonwoman
hendrika she wa cloth in baboon skin and her face had been
rub with some dark stain which wa howev wear off it in
the interv of her cook she would turn on stella her wild ey
in which glare visibl mad with an express of tender that
amount to worship then she would stare at the child and gnash her
teeth as though with hate clearli she wa jealou of it round the
entranc arch of the cave peep and peer the head of mani baboon
present hendrika made a sign to on of them appar she did not
speak or rather grunt in order not to wake stella the brute hop
forward and she gave it a second rude wooden pot which wa ly by
her it took it and went the last thing that i saw as the vision
slowli vanish from the pool wa the dim shadow of the baboon
return with the pot full of water
present everyth had gone i ceas to feel strang there beneath
me wa the pool and at my side stood indabazimbi smile
you have seen thing he said
i have i answer and made no further remark on the matter what wa
there to sai do you know the path to the cave i ad
for some almost equal remark instanc of kaffir
magic the reader is refer to a work name among the
zulu by david leslieeditor
he nod hi head i did not follow it all just now becaus it
wind he said but i know it we shall want the rope
then let us be start the men have eaten
he nod hi head again and go to the men i told them to make
readi ad that indabazimbi knew the wai thei said that wa all
right if indabazimbi had smelt her out thei should soon find the
star so we start cheerfulli enough and my spirit were so much
improv that i wa abl to eat a boil meali cob or two as we walk
we went up the vallei follow the cours of the stream for about a
mile then indabazimbi made a sudden turn to the right along anoth
kloof of which there were countless number in the base of the great
hill
on we went through kloof after kloof indabazimbi who led us wa
never at a loss he turn up gullei and struck across neck of hill
with the certainti of a hound on a hot scent at length after about
three hour march we came to a big silent vallei on the northern slope
of the great peak on on side of thi vallei wa a seri of stoni
koppi on the other rose a sheer wall of rock we march along
the wall for a distanc of some two mile then suddenli indabazimbi
halt
there is the place he said point to an open in the cliff thi
open wa about forti feet from the ground and ellipseshap
it cannot have been more than twenti feet high by ten wide and wa
partial hidden by fern and bush that grew about it in the surfac
of the cliff keen as my ey were i doubt if i should ever have
notic it for there were mani such crack and cranni in the rocki
face of the great mountain
we drew near and look carefulli at the place the first thing i
notic wa that the rock which wa not quit perpendicular had been
worn by the continu passag of baboon the second that someth
white wa hang on a bush near the top of the ascent
it wa a pockethandkerchief
now there wa no more doubt about the matter with a beat heart i
began the ascent for the first twenti feet it wa compar easi
for the rock shelv the next ten feet wa veri difficult but still
possibl to an activ man and i achiev it follow by indabazimbi
but the last twelv or fifteen feet could onli be scale by throw a
rope over the trunk of a stunt tree which grew at the bottom of the
open thi we accomplish with some troubl and the rest wa easi
a foot or two abov my head the handkerchief flutter in the wind
hang to the rope i grasp it it wa my wife as i did so i
notic the face of a baboon peer at me over the edg of the cleft
the first baboon we had seen that morn the brute gave a bark and
vanish thrust the handkerchief into my breast i set my feet
against the cliff and scrambl up as hard as i could go i knew that
we had no time to lose for the baboon would quickli alarm the other i
gain the cleft it wa a mere arch passag cut by water end in
a gullei which led to a wide open space of some sort i look through
the passag and saw that the gullei wa black with baboon on thei came
by the hundr i unslung my eleph gun from my shoulder and wait
call to the men below to come up with all possibl speed the brute
stream on down the gloomi gulf toward me bark grunt and
show their huge teeth i wait till thei were within fifteen yard
then i fire the eleph gun which wa load with slug right into
the thick of them in that narrow place the report echo like a cannon
shot but it sound wa quickli swallow in the vollei of pierc
humansound groan and scream that follow the charg of heavi
slug had plough through the host of baboon of which at least a
dozen lai dead or dy in the passag for a moment thei hesit
then thei came on again with a hideou clamour fortun by thi time
indabazimbi who also had a gun wa stand by my side otherwis i
should have been torn to piec befor i could reload he fire both
barrel into them and again check the rush but thei came on again
and notwithstand the appear of two other nativ with gun which
thei let off with more or less success we should have been overwhelm
by the great and feroci ap had i not by thi time succeed in
reload the eleph gun when thei were right on us i fire with
even more deadli effect than befor for at that distanc everi slug
told on their long line the howl and scream of pain and rage were
now someth inconceiv on might have thought that we were do
battl with a host of demon inde in that lightfor the overhang
arch of rock made it veri darkth gnash snout and sombr glow
ey of the ap look like those of devil as thei ar repres by
monkish fanci but the last shot wa too much for them thei withdrew
drag some of their wound with them and thu gave us time to get
our men up the cliff in a few minut all were there and we advanc
down the passag which present open into a rocki gullei with
shelv side thi gullei had a waterwai at the bottom of it it wa
about a hundr yard long and the slope on either side were top
by precipit cliff i look at these slope thei liter swarm
with baboon grunt bark scream and beat their breast
with their long arm in furi i look up the waterwai along it
accompani by a mob or as it were a guard of baboon ran hendrika
her long hair fly mad written on her face and in her arm wa
the senseless form of littl tota
she saw us and a foam of rage burst from her lip she scream aloud
to me the sound wa a mere inarticul cry but the baboon clearli
understood it for thei began to roll rock down on to us on boulder
leap past me and struck down a kaffir behind anoth fell from the
roof of the arch on to a man head and kill him indabazimbi lift
hi gun to shoot hendrika i knock it up so that the shot went over
her cry that he would kill the child then i shout to the men
to open out and form a line from side to side of the shelv gullei
furiou at the loss of their two comrad thei obei me and keep
in the waterwai myself togeth with indabazimbi and the other gun
i gave the word to charg
then the real battl began it is difficult to sai who fought the most
fierc the nativ or the baboon the kaffir charg along the
slope and as thei came encourag by the scream of hendrika who
rush to and fro hold the wretch tota befor her as a shield the
ap bound at them in furi score were kill by the assegai and
mani more fell beneath our gunshot but still thei came on nor did
we go scathless occasion a man would slip or be pull over in the
grip of a baboon then the other would fling themselv upon him like
dog on a rat and worri him to death we lost five men in thi wai and
i myself receiv a bite through the fleshi part of the left arm but
fortun a nativ near me assegai the anim befor i wa pull
down
at length and all of a sudden the baboon gave up a panic seem to
seiz them notwithstand the cri of hendrika thei thought no more
of fight but onli of escap some even did not attempt to get awai from
the assegai of the kaffir thei simpli hid their horribl face in
their paw and moan piteous wait to be slain
hendrika saw that the battl wa lost drop the child from her arm
she rush straight at us a veri pictur of horribl insan i lift
my gun but could not bear to shoot after all she wa but a mad thing
half ap half woman so i sprang to on side and she land full on

wail terribl she rush down the gullei and through the arch
follow by a few of the surviv baboon and vanish from our sight
chapter xiii
what happen to stella
the fight wa over in all we had lost seven men kill and sever
more sever bitten while but few had escap without some token
wherebi he might rememb what a baboon teeth and claw ar like how
mani of the brute we kill i never knew becaus we did not count but
it wa a vast number i should think that the stock must have been low
about babyan peak for mani year afterward from that dai to thi
howev i have alwai avoid baboon feel more afraid of them than
ani beast that live
the path wa clear and we rush forward along the watercours but
first we pick up littl tota the child wa not in a swoon as i had
thought but paralyz by terror so that she could scarc speak
otherwis she wa unhurt though it took her mani a week to recov her
nerv had she been older and had she not rememb hendrika i doubt
if she would have recov it she knew me again and flung her littl
arm about my neck cling to me so close that i did not dare to
give her to ani on els to carri lest i should add to her terror so i
went on with her in my arm the fear that pierc my heart mai well be
imagin should i find stella live or dead should i find her at all
well we should soon know now we stumbl on up the stoni watercours
notwithstand the weight of tota i led the wai for suspens lent me
wing now we were through and an extraordinari scene lai befor us we
were in a great natur amphitheatr onli it wa three time the size
of ani amphitheatr ever shape by man and the wall were form of
precipit cliff rang from on to two hundr feet in height
for the rest the space thu enclos wa level stud with parklik
tree brilliant with flower and have a stream run through
the centr of it that as i afterward discov well up from the
ground at the head of the open space
we spread ourselv out in a line search everywher for tota wa
too overcom to be abl to tell us where stella wa hidden awai for
nearli half an hour we search and search scan the wall of
rock for ani possibl open to a cave in vain we could find none i
appli to old indabazimbi but hi foresight wa at fault here all
he could sai wa that thi wa the place and that the star wa hidden
somewher in a cave but where the cave wa he could not tell at last
we came to the top of the amphitheatr there befor us wa a wall of
rock of which the lower part were here and there cloth in grass
lichen and creeper i walk along it call at the top of my
voic
present my heart stood still for i thought i heard a faint answer i
drew nearer to the place from which the sound seem to come and again
call ye there wa an answer in my wife voic it seem to come
from the rock i went up to it and search among the creeper but
still could find no open
move the stone cri stella voic the cave is shut with a stone
i took a spear and prod at the cliff whenc the sound came suddenli
the spear sunk in through a mass of lichen i swept the lichen asid
reveal a boulder that had been roll into the mouth of an open in
the rock which it fit so accur that cover as it wa by
the overhang lichen it might well have escap the keenest ey we
drag the boulder out it wa two men work to do it beyond wa
a narrow waterworn passag which i follow with a beat heart
present the passag open into a small cave shape like a pickl
bottl and come to a neck at the top end we pass through and found
ourselv in a second much larger cave that i at onc recogn as
the on of which indabazimbi had shown me a vision in the water light
reach it from abovehow i know notand by it i could see a form
halfsit half ly on some skin at the top end of the cave i
rush to it it wa stella stella bound with strip of hide bruis
torn but still stella and aliv
she saw me she gave on cry then as i caught her in my arm she
faint it wa happi inde that she did not faint befor for had it
not been for the sound of her voic i do not believ we should ever have
found that cunningli hidden cave unless inde indabazimbi magic
on which be bless had come to our assist
we bore her to the open air laid her beneath the shade of a tree and
cut the bond loos from her ankl as we went i glanc at the cave
it wa exactli as i had seen it in the vision there burnt the fire
there were the rude wooden vessel on of them still half full of the
water which i had seen the baboon bring i felt aw as i look and
marvel at the power wield by a savag who could not even read and
write
now i could see stella clearli her face wa scratch and haggard
with fear and weep her cloth were almost torn off her and her
beauti hair wa loos and tangl i sent for water and we sprinkl
her face then i forc a littl of the brandi which we distil from
peach at the kraal between her lip and she open her ey and
throw her arm about me clung to me as littl tota had done sob
thank god thank god
after a while she grew quieter and i made her and tota eat some food
from the store that we had brought with us i too at and wa thank
for with the except of the meali cob i had tast noth for
nearli fourandtwenti hour then she wash her face and hand and
tidi her rag of dress as well as she wa abl as she did so by
degre i drew her stori from her
it seem that on the previou afternoon be weari with pack
she went out to visit her father grave take tota with her and wa
follow there by the two dog she wish to lai some flower on the
grave and take farewel of the dust it cover for as we had expect
to trek earli on the morrow she did not know if she would find a later
opportun thei pass up the garden and gather some flower from
the orang tree and elsewher went on to the littl graveyard here
she laid them on the grave as we had found them and then sit down
fell into a deep and sad reveri such as the occas would natur
induc while she sat thu tota who wa a live child and activ as
a kitten strai awai without stella observ it with her went the
dog who also had grown tire of inact a while pass and suddenli
she heard the dog bark furious about a hundr and fifti yard
awai then she heard tota scream and the dog also yell with fear
and pain she rose and ran as swiftli as she could toward the spot
whenc the sound came present she wa there befor her in the
glade hold the scream tota in her arm wa a figur in which
notwithstand the rough disguis of baboon skin and colour matter
she had no difficulti in recogn hendrika and all about her were
number of baboon roll over and over in two hideou heap of which
the centr were the unfortun dog now in process of be rent to
fragment
hendrika stella cri what doe thi mean what ar you do with
tota and those brute
the woman heard her and look up then stella saw that she wa mad
mad stare from her ey she drop the child which instantli
flew to stella for protect stella clasp it onli to be herself
clasp by hendrika she struggl fierc but it wa of no useth
babyanfrau had the strength of ten she lift her and tota as though
thei were noth and ran off with them follow the bed of the
stream in order to avoid leav a spoor onli the baboon who came with
her minu the on the dog had kill would not take to the water but
kept pace with them on the bank
stella said that the night which follow wa more like a hideou
nightmar than a realiti she wa never abl to tell me all that
occur in it she had a vagu recollect of be born over rock
and along kloof while around her echo the horribl grunt and click
of the baboon she spoke to hendrika in english and kaffir implor
her to let them go but the woman if i mai call her so seem in her
mad to have entir forgotten these tongu when stella spoke she
would kiss her and stroke her hair but she did not seem to understand
what it wa she said on the other hand she could and did talk to
the baboon that seem to obei her implicitli moreov she would not
allow them to touch either stella or the child in her arm onc on
of them tri to do so and she seiz a dead stick and struck it
so heavili on the head that it fell senseless thrice stella made an
attempt to escap for sometim even hendrika giant strength wane
and she had to set them down but on each occas she caught them and
it wa in these struggl that stella cloth were so torn at length
befor daylight thei reach the cliff and with the first break of
light the ascent began hendrika drag them up the first stage but
when thei came to the precipit place she ti the strip of hide
of which she had a suppli wound round her waist beneath stella arm
steep as the place wa the baboon ascend it easili enough spring
from a knock of rock to the trunk of the tree that grew on the edg of
the crevass hendrika follow them hold the end of the hide reim
in her teeth on of the baboon hang down from the tree to assist
her ascent it wa while she wa ascend that stella bethought of
let fall her handkerchief in the faint hope that some searcher might
see it
by thi time hendrika wa on the tree and grunt out order to the
baboon which cluster about stella below suddenli these seiz her
and littl tota who wa in her arm and lift her from the ground
then hendrika abov aid by other baboon put out all her great
strength and pull the two of them up the rock twice stella swung
heavili against the cliff after the second blow she felt her sens
go and wa consum with terror lest she should drop tota but she
manag to cling to her and togeth thei reach the cleft
from that time stella went on i rememb no more till i woke to
find myself in a gloomi cave rest on a bed of skin my leg were
bound and hendrika sat near me watch me while round the edg of the
cave peer the head of those horribl baboon tota wa still in my
arm and half dead from terror her moan were piti to hear i spoke
to hendrika implor her to releas us but either she ha lost all
understand of human speech or she pretend to have done so all
she would do wa to caress me and even kiss my hand and dress with
extravag sign of affect as she did so tota shrunk closer to me
thi hendrika saw and glare so savag at the child that i fear lest
she wa go to kill her i divert her attent by make sign that
i want water and thi she gave me in a wooden bowl as you saw the
cave wa evid hendrika dwellingplac there ar store of fruit
in it and some strip of dri flesh she gave me some of the fruit and
tota a littl and i made tota eat some you can never know what i went
through allan i saw now that hendrika wa quit mad and but littl
remov from the brute to which she is akin and over which she ha
such unholi power the onli trace of human left about her wa her
affect for me evid her idea wa to keep me here with her to
keep me awai from you and to carri out thi idea she wa capabl of the
exercis of everi artific and cun in thi wai she wa sane enough
but in everi other wai she wa mad moreov she had not forgotten her
horribl jealousi alreadi i saw her glare at tota and knew that the
child murder wa onli a matter of time probabl within a few hour
she would be kill befor my ey of escap even if i had the
strength there wa absolut no chanc and littl enough of our ever
be found no we should be kept here guard by a mad thing half
ap half woman till we perish miser then i thought of you
dear and of all that you must be suffer and my heart nearli broke
i could onli prai to god that i might either be rescu or die swiftli
as i prai i drop into a kind of doze from utter weari and
then i had the strangest dream i dream that indabazimbi stood over
me nod hi white lock and spoke to me in kaffir tell me not to
be frighten for you would soon be with me and that meanwhil i must
humour hendrika pretend to be pleas to have her near me the dream
wa so vivid that i actual seem to see and hear him as i see and
hear him now
here i look up and glanc at old indabazimbi who wa sit near
but it wa not till afterward that i told stella of how her vision wa
brought about
at ani rate she went on when i awok i determin to act on my
dream i took hendrika hand and press it she actual laugh in a
wild kind of wai with happi and laid her head upon my knee then i
made sign that i want food and she threw wood on the fire which i
forgot to tell you wa burn in the cave and began to make some of
the broth that she us to cook veri well and she did not seem to
have forgotten all about it at ani rate the broth wa not bad though
neither tota nor i could drink much of it fright and weari had
taken awai our appetit
after the meal wa doneand i prolong it as much as possiblei saw
hendrika wa begin to get jealou of tota again she glare at her
and then at the big knife which wa ti round her own bodi i knew
the knife again it wa the on with which she had tri to murder you
dear at last she went so far as to draw the knife i wa paralyz with
fear then suddenli i rememb that when she wa our servant and us
to get out of temper and sulk i could alwai calm her by sing to
her so i began to sing hymn instantli she forgot her jealousi and put
the knife back into it sheath she knew the sound of the sing and
sat listen to it with a rapt face the baboon too crowd in at
the entranc of the cave to listen i must have sung for an hour or
more all the hymn that i could rememb it wa so veri strang
and dread sit there sing to mad hendrika and those hideou
manlik ap that shut their ey and nod their great head as i
sang it wa a horribl nightmar but i believ that the baboon ar
almost as human as the bushmen
well thi went on for a long time till my voic wa get exhaust
then suddenli i heard the baboon outsid rais a loud nois as thei do
when thei ar angri then dear i heard the boom of your eleph
gun and i think it wa the sweetest sound that ever came to my ear
hendrika heard it too she sprang up stood for a moment then to my
horror swept tota into her arm and rush down the cave of cours
i could not stir to follow her for my feet were ti next instant i
heard the sound of a rock be move and present the lessen of
the light in the cave told me that i wa shut in now the sound even
of the eleph gun onli reach me veri faintli and present i could
hear noth more strain my ear as i would
at last i heard a faint shout that reach me through the wall of
rock i answer as loud as i could you know the rest and oh my dear
husband thank god thank god and she fell weep into my arm
chapter xiv
fifteen year after
both stella and tota were too weari to be move so we camp that night
in the baboon home but were troubl by no baboon stella would not
sleep in the cave she said the place terrifi her so i made her up a
kind of bed under a thorntre as thi rockbound vallei wa on of the
hottest place i ever wa in i thought that thi would not matter but
when at sunris on the follow morn i saw a veil of miasmat mist
hang over the surfac of the ground i chang my opinion howev
neither stella nor tota seem the wors so as soon as wa practic
we start homeward i had alreadi on the previou dai sent some of the
men back to the kraal to fetch a ladder and when we reach the cliff
we found them wait for us beneath with the help of the ladder the
descent wa easi stella simpli got out of her rough litter at the top
of the cliff for we found it necessari to carri her climb down the
ladder and got into it again at the bottom
well we reach the kraal safe enough see noth more of
hendrika and were thi a stori doubtless i should end it here
withand live happili ever after but ala it is not so how am i
to write it
my dearest wife vital energi seem complet to fail her now that
the danger wa past and within twelv hour of our return i saw that
her state wa such as to necessit the abandon of ani idea of
leav babyan kraal at present the bodili exert the anguish of
mind and the terror which she had endur dure that dread night
combin with her delic state of health had complet broken her
down to make matter wors also she wa taken with an attack of
fever contract no doubt in the unhealthi atmospher of that accurs
vallei in time she shook the fever off but it left her dreadfulli
weak and quit unfit to face the trial befor her
i think she knew that she wa go to die she alwai spoke of my
futur never of our futur it is imposs for me to tell how sweet
she wa how gentl how patient and resign nor inde do i wish
to tell it it is too sad but thi i will sai i believ that if ever
a woman drew near to perfect while yet live on the earth stella
quatermain did so
the fatal hour drew on my boi harri wa born and hi mother live
to kiss and bless him then she sank we did what we could but we had
littl skill and might not hold her back from death all through on
weari night i watch her with a break heart
the dawn came the sun rose in the east hi rai fall on the peak
behind were reflect in glori upon the bosom of the western sky stella
awok from her swoon and saw the light she whisper to me to open the
door of the hut i did so and she fix her dy ey on the splendour
of the morn sky she look on me and smile as an angel might
smile then with a last effort she lift her hand and point to the
radiant heaven whisper
there allan there
it wa done and i wa brokenheart and brokenheart i must wander
to the end those who have endur my loss will know my sorrow it
cannot be written in such peac and at such an hour mai i also die
ye it is a sad stori but wander where we will about the world we can
never go beyond the sound of the pass bell for me as for my father
befor me and for the million who have been and who shall be there is
but on word of comfort the lord hath given and the lord hath taken
awai let us then bow our head in hope and add with a humbl heart
bless be the name of the lord
i buri her by her father side and the weep of the peopl who had
love her went up to heaven even indabazimbi wept but i could weep no
more
on the second night from her burial i could not sleep i rose dress
myself and went out into the night the moon wa shine brightli
and by it rai i shape my cours toward the graveyard i drew near
silent and as i came i thought that i heard a sound of moan on the
further side of the wall i look over it crouch by stella grave
and tear at it sod with her hand as though she would unearth that
which lai within wa hendrika her face wa wild and haggard her
form wa so emaci that when the pelt she wore slip asid the
shoulderblad seem to project almost through her skin suddenli she
look up and saw me laugh a dread maniac laugh she put her hand
to her girdl and drew her great knife from it i thought that she wa
about to attack me and prepar to defend myself as i best could for i
wa unarm but she made no effort to do so lift the knife on high
for a moment she held it glitter in the moonlight then plung it
into her own breast and fell headlong to the ground
i sprang over the wall and ran to her she wa not yet dead present
she open her ey and i saw that the mad had gone out of them
macumazahn she said speak in english and in an thick difficult
voic like on who half forgot and half rememberedmacumazahn i
rememb now i have been mad is she realli dead macumazahn

i kill her the dy woman falter and i love her ye ye i
know now i becam a brute again and drag her to the brute and now
onc more i am a woman and she is dead and i kill herbecaus i
love her so i kill her who save me from the brute i am not dead
yet macumazahn take me and tortur me to death slowli veri slowli
it wa jealousi of you that drove me mad and i have kill her and now
she never can forgiv me
ask forgiv from abov i said for hendrika had been a christian
and the torment of her remors touch me
i ask no forgiv she said mai god tortur me for ever becaus
i kill her mai i becom a brute for ever till she come to find me
and forgiv me i onli want her forgiv and wail in an anguish
of the heart so strong that her bodili suffer seem to be forgotten
hendrika the baboonwoman di
i went back to the kraal and wake indabazimbi told him what had
happen ask him to send some on to watch the bodi as i propos
to give it burial but next morn it wa gone and i found that the
nativ hear of the event had taken the corps and thrown it to the
vultur with everi mark of hate such then wa the end of hendrika
a week after hendrika death i left babyan kraal the place wa
hate to me now it wa a haunt place i sent for old indabazimbi
and told him that i wa go he answer that it wa well the place
ha serv your turn he said here you have won that joi which it wa
fate you should win and have suffer those thing that it wa fate

we mai meet again but it will not be in thi world henceforth we have
each of us a friend the less
heavi word i said

well i have littl heart to write the rest of it i went leav
indabazimbi in charg of the place and make him a present of such
cattl and good as i did not want
tota i of cours took with me fortun by thi time she had almost
recov the shock to her nerv the babi harri as he wa afterward
name wa a fine healthi child and i wa lucki in get a
respect nativ woman whose husband had been kill in the fight
with the baboon to accompani me as hi nurs
slowli and follow for a distanc by all the peopl i trek awai
from babyan kraal my rout toward natal wa along the edg of the
bad land and my first night outspan wa beneath that veri tree where
stella my lost wife had found us as we lai dy of thirst
i did not sleep much that night and yet i wa glad that i had not di
in the desert about eleven month befor i felt then as from year
to year i have continu to feel while i wander through the lone
wilder of life that i had been preserv to an end i had won my
darl love and for a littl while we had been happi togeth our
happi wa too perfect to endur she is lost to me now but she is
lost to be found again
here on the follow morn i bade farewel to indabazimbi
goodby macumazahn he said nod hi white lock at me goodby
for a while i am not a christian your father could not make me that
but he wa a wise man and when he said that those who love each other
shall meet again he did not lie and i too am a wise man in my wai
macumazahn and i sai it is true that we shall meet again all my
propheci to you have come true macumazahn and thi on shall come
true also i tell you that you shall return to babyan kraal and shall
not find me i tell you that you shall journei to a further land than
babyan kraal and shall find me farewel and he took a pinch of
snuff turn and went
of my journei down to natal there is littl to tell i met with mani
adventur but thei were of an everydai kind and in the end arriv
safe at port durban which i now visit for the first time both tota
and my babi boi bore the journei well and here i mai as well chronicl
the destini of tota for a year she remain under my charg then she
wa adopt by a ladi the wife of an english colonel who wa station
at the cape she wa taken by her adopt parent to england where
she grew up a veri charm and pretti girl and ultim marri a
clergyman in norfolk but i never saw her again though we often wrote
to each other
befor i return to the countri of my birth she too had been gather
to the land of shadow leav three children behind her ah me all
thi took place so long ago when i wa young who now am old
perhap it mai interest the reader to know the fate of mr carson
properti which should of cours have gone to hi grandson harri i
wrote to england to claim the estat on hi behalf but the lawyer
to whom the matter wa submit said that my marriag to stella not
have been celebr by an ordain priest wa not legal accord to
english law and therefor harri could not inherit foolishli enough
i acquiesc in thi and the properti pass to a cousin of my
fatherinlaw but sinc i have come to live in england i have been
inform that thi opinion is open to great suspicion and that there
is everi probabl that the court would have declar the marriag
perfectli bind as have been solemnli enter into in accord
with the custom of the place where it wa contract but i am now so
rich that it is not worth while to move in the matter the cousin is
dead hi son is in possess so let him keep it
onc and onc onli did i revisit babyan kraal some fifteen year
after my darl death when i wa a man in middl life i undertook
an expedit to the zambesi and on night outspan at the mouth of
the wellknown vallei beneath the shadow of the great peak i mount
my hors and quit alon rode up the vallei notic with a strang
prescienc of evil that the road wa overgrown and save for the music
of the waterfal the place silent as death the kraal that us to be
to the left of the road by the river had vanish i rode toward their
site the meali field were choke with weed the path were dumb with
grass present i reach the place there overgrown with grass were
the burnt ash of the kraal and there among the ash gleam in
the moonlight lai the white bone of men now it wa clear to me the
settlement had been fallen on by some power foe and it inhabit
put to the assegai the forebod of the nativ had come true babyan
kraal were peopl by memori alon
i pass on up the terrac there shone the roof of the marbl hut
thei would not burn and were too strong to be easili pull down i
enter on of themit had been our sleep hutand lit a candl
which i had with me the hut had been sack leav of book and
broken moulder fragment of the familiar furnitur lai about then
i rememb that there wa a secret place hollow in the floor and
conceal by a stone where stella us to hide her littl treasur i
went to the stone and drag it up there wa someth within wrap
in rot nativ cloth i undid it it wa the dress my wife had been
marri in in the centr of the dress were the wither wreath and
flower she had worn and with them a littl paper packet i open it
it contain a lock of my own hair
i rememb then that i had search for thi dress when i came awai
and could not find it for i had forgotten the secret recess in the
floor
take the dress with me i left the hut for the last time leav
my hors ti to a tree i walk to the graveyard through the ruin
garden there it wa a mass of weed but over my darl grave grew a
selfsown orang bush of which the scent petal fell in shower on to
the mound beneath as i drew near there wa a crash and a rush a great
baboon leapt from the centr of the graveyard and vanish into the
tree i could almost believ that it wa the wraith of hendrika doom
to keep an etern watch over the bone of the woman her jealou rage
had done to death
i tarri there a while fill with such thought as mai not be
written then leav my dead wife to her long sleep where the water
fall in melancholi music beneath the shadow of the everlast mountain
i turn and sought that spot where first we had told our love now the
orang grove wa noth but a tangl thicket mani of the tree were
dead choke with creeper but some still flourish there stood the
on beneath which we had linger there wa the rock that had been our
seat and there on the rock sat the wraith of stella the stella whom
i had wed ay there she sat and on her upturn face wa that same
spiritu look which i saw upon it in the hour when we first had kiss
the moonlight shone in her dark ey the breez waver in her curl
hair her breast rose and fell a gentl smile plai about her
part lip i stood transfix with aw and joi gaze on that lost
loveli which onc wa mine i could not speak and she spoke no
word she did not even seem to see me now her ey fell for a moment
thei met mine and their messag enter into me
then she wa gone she wa gone noth wa left but the tremul
moonlight fall where she had been the melancholi music of the
water the shadow of the everlast mountain and in my heart the
sorrow and the hope
