introduct
now that thi book is print and about to be given to the world a
sens of it shortcom both in style and content weigh veri
heavili upon me as regard the latter i can onli sai that it doe not
pretend to be a full account of everyth we did and saw there ar
mani thing connect with our journei into kukuanaland that i should
have like to dwell upon at length which as it is have been scarc
allud to amongst these ar the curiou legend which i collect
about the chain armour that save us from destruct in the great
battl of loo and also about the silent on or colossi at the mouth
of the stalactit cave again if i had given wai to my own impuls i
should have wish to go into the differ some of which ar to my
mind veri suggest between the zulu and kukuana dialect also a few
page might have been given up profit to the consider of the
indigen flora and fauna of kukuanaland1 then there remain the
most interest subjectthat as it is ha onli been touch on
incidentallyof the magnific system of militari organis in
forc in that countri which in my opinion is much superior to that
inaugur by chaka in zululand inasmuch as it permit of even more
rapid mobilis and doe not necessit the employ of the
pernici system of enforc celibaci lastli i have scarc spoken
of the domest and famili custom of the kukuana mani of which ar
exceedingli quaint or of their profici in the art of smelt and
weld metal thi scienc thei carri to consider perfect of
which a good exampl is to be seen in their tolla or heavi throw
knive the back of these weapon be made of hammer iron and the
edg of beauti steel weld with great skill on to the iron frame
the fact of the matter is i thought with sir henri curti and captain
good that the best plan would be to tell my stori in a plain
straightforward manner and to leav these matter to be dealt with
subsequ in whatev wai ultim mai appear to be desir in
the meanwhil i shall of cours be delight to give all inform
in my power to anybodi interest in such thing
and now it onli remain for me to offer apolog for my blunt wai of
write i can but sai in excus of it that i am more accustom to
handl a rifl than a pen and cannot make ani pretenc to the grand
literari flight and flourish which i see in novelsfor sometim i
like to read a novel i suppos theyth flight and flourishesar
desir and i regret not be abl to suppli them but at the same
time i cannot help think that simpl thing ar alwai the most
impress and that book ar easier to understand when thei ar
written in plain languag though perhap i have no right to set up an
opinion on such a matter a sharp spear run the kukuana sai
need no polish and on the same principl i ventur to hope that a
true stori howev strang it mai be doe not requir to be deck
out in fine word

chapter i
i meet sir henri curti
it is a curiou thing that at my agefiftyf last birthdayi
should find myself take up a pen to try to write a histori i wonder
what sort of a histori it will be when i have finish it if ever i
come to the end of the trip i have done a good mani thing in my life
which seem a long on to me ow to my have begun work so young
perhap at an ag when other boi ar at school i wa earn my
live as a trader in the old coloni i have been trade hunt
fight or mine ever sinc and yet it is onli eight month ago
that i made my pile it is a big pile now that i have got iti dont
yet know how bigbut i do not think i would go through the last
fifteen or sixteen month again for it no not if i knew that i should
come out safe at the end pile and all but then i am a timid man and
dislik violenc moreov i am almost sick of adventur i wonder why
i am go to write thi book it is not in my line i am not a
literari man though veri devot to the old testament and also to the
ingoldsbi legend let me try to set down my reason just to see if
i have ani
first reason becaus sir henri curti and captain john good ask me
second reason becaus i am laid up here at durban with the pain in my
left leg ever sinc that confound lion got hold of me i have been
liabl to thi troubl and be rather bad just now it make me limp
more than ever there must be some poison in a lion teeth otherwis
how is it that when your wound ar heal thei break out again
gener mark you at the same time of year that you got your
maul it is a hard thing when on ha shot sixtyf lion or more
as i have in the cours of my life that the sixtysixth should chew
your leg like a quid of tobacco it break the routin of the thing
and put other consider asid i am an orderli man and dont
like that thi is by the wai
third reason becaus i want my boi harri who is over there at the
hospit in london studi to becom a doctor to have someth to
amus him and keep him out of mischief for a week or so hospit work
must sometim pall and grow rather dull for even of cut up dead
bodi there mai come satieti and as thi histori will not be dull
whatev els it mai be it will put a littl life into thing for a
dai or two while harri is read of our adventur
fourth reason and last becaus i am go to tell the strangest stori
that i rememb it mai seem a queer thing to sai especi
consid that there is no woman in itexcept foulata stop though
there is gagaoola if she wa a woman and not a fiend but she wa a
hundr at least and therefor not marriag so i dont count her
at ani rate i can safe sai that there is not a petticoat in the
whole histori
well i had better come to the yoke it is a stiff place and i feel as
though i were bog up to the axl but sutj sutj as the
boer sayi am sure i dont know how thei spell itsoftli doe it a
strong team will come through at last that is if thei ar not too
poor you can never do anyth with poor oxen now to make a start
i allan quatermain of durban natal gentleman make oath and
saythat how i head my deposit befor the magistr about poor
khiva and ventvgel sad death but somehow it doesnt seem quit
the right wai to begin a book and besid am i a gentleman what is
a gentleman i dont quit know and yet i have had to do with
niggersno i will scratch out that word nigger for i do not like
it iv known nativ who ar and so you will sai harri my boi
befor you have done with thi tale and i have known mean white with
lot of monei and fresh out from home too who ar not
at ani rate i wa born a gentleman though i have been noth but a
poor travel trader and hunter all my life whether i have remain
so i known not you must judg of that heaven know iv tri i have
kill mani men in my time yet i have never slain wantonli or stain
my hand in innoc blood but onli in selfdef the almighti gave
us our live and i suppos he meant us to defend them at least i have
alwai act on that and i hope it will not be brought up against me
when my clock strike there there it is a cruel and a wick world
and for a timid man i have been mix up in a great deal of fight i
cannot tell the right of it but at ani rate i have never stolen
though onc i cheat a kafir out of a herd of cattl but then he had
done me a dirti turn and it ha troubl me ever sinc into the
bargain
well it is eighteen month or so ago sinc first i met sir henri
curti and captain good it wa in thi wai i had been up eleph
hunt beyond bamangwato and had met with bad luck everyth went
wrong that trip and to top up with i got the fever badli so soon as i
wa well enough i trek down to the diamond field sold such ivori
as i had togeth with my wagon and oxen discharg my hunter and
took the postcart to the cape after spend a week in cape town
find that thei overcharg me at the hotel and have seen
everyth there wa to see includ the botan garden which
seem to me like to confer a great benefit on the countri and the new
hous of parliament which i expect will do noth of the sort i
determin to go back to natal by the dunkeld then ly at the
dock wait for the edinburgh castl due in from england i took my
berth and went aboard and that afternoon the natal passeng from the
edinburgh castl tranship and we weigh and put to sea
among these passeng who came on board were two who excit my
curios on a gentleman of about thirti wa perhap the
biggestchest and longestarm man i ever saw he had yellow hair a
thick yellow beard clearcut featur and larg grei ey set deep in
hi head i never saw a finerlook man and somehow he remind me
of an ancient dane not that i know much of ancient dane though i
knew a modern dane who did me out of ten pound but i rememb onc
see a pictur of some of those gentri who i take it were a kind
of white zulu thei were drink out of big horn and their long
hair hung down their back as i look at my friend stand there by
the companionladd i thought that if he onli let hi grow a littl
put on of those chain shirt on to hi great shoulder and took hold
of a battleax and a horn mug he might have sat as a model for that
pictur and by the wai it is a curiou thing and just show how the
blood will out i discov afterward that sir henri curti for that
wa the big man name is of danish blood1 he also remind me
strongli of somebodi els but at the time i could not rememb who it
wa
the other man who stood talk to sir henri wa stout and dark and
of quit a differ cut i suspect at onc that he wa a naval
offic i dont know why but it is difficult to mistak a navi man i
have gone shoot trip with sever of them in the cours of my life
and thei have alwai prove themselv the best and bravest and nicest
fellow i ever met though sadli given some of them to the us of
profan languag i ask a page or two back what is a gentleman ill
answer the question now a royal naval offic is in a gener sort of
wai though of cours there mai be a black sheep among them here and
there i fanci it is just the wide sea and the breath of god wind
that wash their heart and blow the bitter out of their mind and
make them what men ought to be
well to return i prove right again i ascertain that the dark man
wa a naval offic a lieuten of thirtyon who after seventeen
year servic had been turn out of her majesti emploi with the
barren honour of a command rank becaus it wa imposs that he
should be promot thi is what peopl who serv the queen have to
expect to be shot out into the cold world to find a live just when
thei ar begin realli to understand their work and to reach the
prime of life i suppos thei dont mind it but for my own part i had
rather earn my bread as a hunter on halfpenc ar as scarc
perhap but you do not get so mani kick
the offic name i found outbi refer to the passeng
listswa goodcaptain john good he wa broad of medium height
dark stout and rather a curiou man to look at he wa so veri neat
and so veri cleanshav and he alwai wore an eyeglass in hi right
ey it seem to grow there for it had no string and he never took
it out except to wipe it at first i thought he us to sleep in it
but afterward i found that thi wa a mistak he put it in hi
trouser pocket when he went to bed togeth with hi fals teeth of
which he had two beauti set that my own be none of the best
have often caus me to break the tenth command but i am
anticip
soon after we had got under wai even close in and brought with it
veri dirti weather a keen breez sprung up off land and a kind of
aggrav scotch mist soon drove everybodi from the deck as for the
dunkeld she is a flatbottom punt and go up light as she wa
she roll veri heavili it almost seem as though she would go right
over but she never did it wa quit imposs to walk about so i
stood near the engin where it wa warm and amus myself with
watch the pendulum which wa fix opposit to me swing slowli
backward and forward as the vessel roll and mark the angl she
touch at each lurch
that pendulum wrong it is not properli weight suddenli said a
somewhat testi voic at my shoulder look round i saw the naval
offic whom i had notic when the passeng came aboard
inde now what make you think so i ask
think so i dont think at all why therea she right herself
after a rollif the ship had realli roll to the degre that thing
point to then she would never have roll again that all but it
is just like these merchant skipper thei ar alwai so confoundedli
careless
just then the dinnerbel rang and i wa not sorri for it is a
dread thing to have to listen to an offic of the royal navi when
he get on to that subject i onli know on wors thing and that is to
hear a merchant skipper express hi candid opinion of offic of the
royal navi
captain good and i went down to dinner togeth and there we found sir
henri curti alreadi seat he and captain good were place togeth
and i sat opposit to them the captain and i soon fell into talk about
shoot and what not he ask me mani question for he is veri
inquisit about all sort of thing and i answer them as well as
i could present he got on to eleph
ah sir call out somebodi who wa sit near me youv reach
the right man for that hunter quatermain should be abl to tell you
about eleph if anybodi can
sir henri who had been sit quit quiet listen to our talk
start visibl
excus me sir he said lean forward across the tabl and
speak in a low deep voic a veri suitabl voic it seem to me
to come out of those great lung excus me sir but is your name
allan quatermain
i said that it wa
the big man made no further remark but i heard him mutter fortun
into hi beard
present dinner came to an end and as we were leav the saloon sir
henri stroll up and ask me if i would come into hi cabin to smoke
a pipe i accept and he led the wai to the dunkeld deck cabin and
a veri good cabin it is it had been two cabin but when sir garnet
wolselei or on of those big swell went down the coast in the
dunkeld thei knock awai the partit and have never put it up
again there wa a sofa in the cabin and a littl tabl in front of
it sir henri sent the steward for a bottl of whiski and the three of
us sat down and lit our pipe
mr quatermain said sir henri curti when the man had brought the
whiski and lit the lamp the year befor last about thi time you
were i believ at a place call bamangwato to the north of the
transvaal
i wa i answer rather surpris that thi gentleman should be so
well acquaint with my movement which were not so far as i wa
awar consid of gener interest
you were trade there were you not put in captain good in hi
quick wai
i wa i took up a wagonload of good made a camp outsid the
settlement and stop till i had sold them
sir henri wa sit opposit to me in a madeira chair hi arm
lean on the tabl he now look up fix hi larg grei ey full
upon my face there wa a curiou anxieti in them i thought
did you happen to meet a man call nevil there
oh ye he outspan alongsid of me for a fortnight to rest hi
oxen befor go on to the interior i had a letter from a lawyer a
few month back ask me if i knew what had becom of him which i
answer to the best of my abil at the time
ye said sir henri your letter wa forward to me you said in it
that the gentleman call nevil left bamangwato at the begin of
mai in a wagon with a driver a voorloop and a kafir hunter call
jim announc hi intent of trek if possibl as far as inyati
the extrem trade post in the matabel countri where he would sell
hi wagon and proce on foot you also said that he did sell hi
wagon for six month afterward you saw the wagon in the possess of
a portugues trader who told you that he had bought it at inyati from
a white man whose name he had forgotten and that he believ the white
man with the nativ servant had start off for the interior on a
shoot trip
ye
then came a paus
mr quatermain said sir henri suddenli i suppos you know or can
guess noth more of the reason of myof mr nevil journei to
the northward or as to what point that journei wa direct
i heard someth i answer and stop the subject wa on which
i did not care to discuss
sir henri and captain good look at each other and captain good
nod
mr quatermain went on the former i am go to tell you a stori
and ask your advic and perhap your assist the agent who
forward me your letter told me that i might reli on it implicitli as
you were he said well known and univers respect in natal and
especi note for your discret
i bow and drank some whiski and water to hide my confus for i am
a modest manand sir henri went on
mr nevil wa my brother
oh i said start for now i knew of whom sir henri had remind
me when first i saw him hi brother wa a much smaller man and had a
dark beard but now that i thought of it he possess ey of the same
shade of grei and with the same keen look in them the featur too
were not unlik
he wa went on sir henri my onli and younger brother and till
five year ago i do not suppos that we were ever a month awai from
each other but just about five year ago a misfortun befel us as
sometim doe happen in famili we quarrel bitterli and i
behav unjustli to my brother in my anger
here captain good nod hi head vigor to himself the ship gave
a big roll just then so that the lookingglass which wa fix
opposit us to starboard wa for a moment nearli over our head and
as i wa sit with my hand in my pocket and stare upward i
could see him nod like anyth
as i daresai you know went on sir henri if a man di intest
and ha no properti but land real properti it is call in england it
all descend to hi eldest son it so happen that just at the time
when we quarrel our father di intest he had put off make hi
will until it wa too late the result wa that my brother who had not
been brought up to ani profess wa left without a penni of cours
it would have been my duti to provid for him but at the time the
quarrel between us wa so bitter that i did notto my shame i sai it
and he sigh deeplyoff to do anyth it wa not that i grudg
him justic but i wait for him to make advanc and he made none i
am sorri to troubl you with all thi mr quatermain but i must to
make thing clear eh good
quit so quit so said the captain mr quatermain will i am
sure keep thi histori to himself
of cours said i for i rather pride myself on my discret for
which as sir henri had heard i have some reput
well went on sir henri my brother had a few hundr pound to hi
account at the time without sai anyth to me he drew out thi
paltri sum and have adopt the name of nevil start off for
south africa in the wild hope of make a fortun thi i learn
afterward some three year pass and i heard noth of my brother
though i wrote sever time doubtless the letter never reach him
but as time went on i grew more and more troubl about him i found
out mr quatermain that blood is thicker than water
that true said i think of my boi harri
i found out mr quatermain that i would have given half my fortun
to know that my brother georg the onli relat i possess wa safe
and well and that i should see him again
but you never did curti jerk out captain good glanc at the
big man face
well mr quatermain as time went on i becam more and more anxiou
to find out if my brother wa aliv or dead and if aliv to get him
home again i set enquiri on foot and your letter wa on of the
result so far as it went it wa satisfactori for it show that till
late georg wa aliv but it did not go far enough so to cut a
long stori short i made up my mind to come out and look for him
myself and captain good wa so kind as to come with me
ye said the captain noth els to do you see turn out by my
lord of the admiralti to starv on half pai and now perhap sir you
will tell us what you know or have heard of the gentleman call
nevil
1 mr quatermain idea about ancient dane seem to be rather
confus we have alwai understood that thei were darkhair peopl
probabl he wa think of saxonseditor
chapter ii
the legend of solomon mine
what wa it that you heard about my brother journei at bamangwato
ask sir henri as i paus to fill my pipe befor repli to captain
good
i heard thi i answer and i have never mention it to a soul
till todai i heard that he wa start for solomon mine
solomon mine ejacul both my hearer at onc where ar thei
i dont know i said i know where thei ar said to be onc i saw
the peak of the mountain that border them but there were a hundr
and thirti mile of desert between me and them and i am not awar that
ani white man ever got across it save on but perhap the best thing i
can do is to tell you the legend of solomon mine as i know it you
pass your word not to reveal anyth i tell you without my
permiss do you agre to that i have my reason for ask
sir henri nod and captain good repli certainli certainli
well i began as you mai guess gener speak eleph
hunter ar a rough set of men who do not troubl themselv with much
beyond the fact of life and the wai of kafir but here and there you
meet a man who take the troubl to collect tradit from the
nativ and tri to make out a littl piec of the histori of thi
dark land it wa such a man as thi who first told me the legend of
solomon mine now a matter of nearli thirti year ago that wa when
i wa on my first eleph hunt in the mataleb countri hi name wa
evan and he wa kill the follow year poor fellow by a wound
buffalo and li buri near the zambesi fall i wa tell evan
on night i rememb of some wonder work i had found whilst
hunt koodoo and eland in what is now the lydenburg district of the
transvaal i see thei have come across these work again late in
prospect for gold but i knew of them year ago there is a great
wide wagon road cut out of the solid rock and lead to the mouth of
the work or galleri insid the mouth of thi galleri ar stack of
gold quartz pile up readi for roast which show that the worker
whoever thei were must have left in a hurri also about twenti pace
in the galleri is built across and a beauti bit of masonri it is
ay said evan but i will spin you a queerer yarn than that and
he went on to tell me how he had found in the far interior a ruin
citi which he believ to be the ophir of the bibl and by the wai
other more learn men have said the same long sinc poor evanss time
i wa i rememb listen openear to all these wonder for i wa
young at the time and thi stori of an ancient civilis and of the
treasur which those old jewish or phoenician adventur us to
extract from a countri long sinc laps into the darkest barbar
took a great hold upon my imagin when suddenli he said to me
lad did you ever hear of the suliman mountain up to the northwest
of the mushakulumbw countri i told him i never had ah well he
said that is where solomon realli had hi mine hi diamond mine i
mean
how do you know that i ask
know it why what is suliman but a corrupt of solomon1
besid an old isanusi or witch doctoress up in the manica countri
told me all about it she said that the peopl who live across those
mountain were a branch of the zulu speak a dialect of zulu but
finer and bigger men even that there live among them great wizard
who had learnt their art from white men when all the world wa dark
and who had the secret of a wonder mine of bright stone
well i laugh at thi stori at the time though it interest me
for the diamond field were not discov then but poor evan went
off and wa kill and for twenti year i never thought ani more of
the matter howev just twenti year afterwardsand that is a long
time gentlemen an eleph hunter doe not often live for twenti
year at hi businessi heard someth more definit about suliman
mountain and the countri which li beyond them i wa up beyond the
manica countri at a place call sitanda kraal and a miser
place it wa for a man could get noth to eat and there wa but
littl game about i had an attack of fever and wa in a bad wai
gener when on dai a portuge arriv with a singl companiona
halfbre now i know your lowclass delagoa portuge well there is
no greater devil unhung in a gener wai batten as he doe upon
human agoni and flesh in the shape of slave but thi wa quit a
differ type of man to the mean fellow whom i had been accustom to
meet inde in appear he remind me more of the polit dom i
have read about for he wa tall and thin with larg dark ey and
curl grei mustachio we talk togeth for a while for he could
speak broken english and i understood a littl portuge and he told
me that hi name wa jo silvestr and that he had a place near
delagoa bai when he went on next dai with hi halfbre companion he
said goodby take off hi hat quit in the old style
goodby senor he said if ever we meet again i shall be the
richest man in the world and i will rememb you i laugh a
littlei wa too weak to laugh muchand watch him strike out for
the great desert to the west wonder if he wa mad or what he
thought he wa go to find there
a week pass and i got the better of my fever on even i wa
sit on the ground in front of the littl tent i had with me
chew the last leg of a miser fowl i had bought from a nativ for
a bit of cloth worth twenti fowl and stare at the hot red sun
sink down over the desert when suddenli i saw a figur appar
that of a european for it wore a coat on the slope of the rise
ground opposit to me about three hundr yard awai the figur crept
along on it hand and knee then it got up and stagger forward a
few yard on it leg onli to fall and crawl again see that it
must be somebodi in distress i sent on of my hunter to help him and
present he arriv and who do you suppos it turn out to be
jo silvestr of cours said captain good
ye jo silvestr or rather hi skeleton and a littl skin hi
face wa a bright yellow with biliou fever and hi larg dark ey
stood nearli out of hi head for all the flesh had gone there wa
noth but yellow parchmentlik skin white hair and the gaunt bone
stick up beneath
water for the sake of christ water he moan and i saw that hi
lip were crack and hi tongu which protrud between them wa
swollen and blackish
i gave him water with a littl milk in it and he drank it in great
gulp two quart or so without stop i would not let him have ani
more then the fever took him again and he fell down and began to rave
about suliman mountain and the diamond and the desert i carri
him into the tent and did what i could for him which wa littl
enough but i saw how it must end about eleven oclock he grew
quieter and i lai down for a littl rest and went to sleep at dawn i
woke again and in the half light saw silvestr sit up a strang
gaunt form and gaze out toward the desert present the first rai
of the sun shot right across the wide plain befor us till it reach
the farawai crest of on of the tallest of the suliman mountain more
than a hundr mile awai
there it is cri the dy man in portugues and point with
hi long thin arm but i shall never reach it never no on will
ever reach it
suddenli he paus and seem to take a resolut friend he
said turn toward me ar you there my ey grow dark
ye i said ye lie down now and rest
ay he answer i shall rest soon i have time to restal
etern listen i am dy you have been good to me i will give you
the write perhap you will get there if you can live to pass the
desert which ha kill my poor servant and me
then he grope in hi shirt and brought out what i thought wa a boer
tobacco pouch made of the skin of the swartvetpen or sabl antelop
it wa fasten with a littl strip of hide what we call a rimpi and
thi he tri to loos but could not he hand it to me unti it
he said i did so and extract a bit of torn yellow linen on which
someth wa written in rusti letter insid thi rag wa a paper
then he went on feebli for he wa grow weak the paper ha all
that is on the linen it took me year to read listen my ancestor a
polit refuge from lisbon and on of the first portugues who
land on these shore wrote that when he wa dy on those mountain
which no white foot ever press befor or sinc hi name wa jo da
silvestra and he live three hundr year ago hi slave who wait
for him on thi side of the mountain found him dead and brought the
write home to delagoa it ha been in the famili ever sinc but none
have care to read it till at last i did and i have lost my life over
it but anoth mai succe and becom the richest man in the
worldth richest man in the world onli give it to no on senor go
yourself
then he began to wander again and in an hour it wa all over
god rest him he di veri quietli and i buri him deep with big

sir henri laid hi larg hand upon my shoulder sit down mr
quatermain he said i beg your pardon i see veri well you do not
wish to deceiv us but the stori sound so strang that i could
hardli believ it
you shall see the origin map and write when we reach durban i
answer somewhat mollifi for realli when i came to consid the
question it wa scarc wonder that he should doubt my good faith
but i went on i have not told you about your brother i knew the
man jim who wa with him he wa a bechuana by birth a good hunter
and for a nativ a veri clever man that morn on which mr nevil

countri myself the eleph ar get work out about here

necessari till i find him or until i know that he is dead will you

journei would be to go to certain death and put other
consider asid as i had a son to support i could not afford to
die just then
no thank you sir henri i think i had rather not i answer i am
too old for wildgoos chase of that sort and we should onli end up

chapter iii
umbopa enter our servic
it take from four to five dai accord to the speed of the vessel
and the state of the weather to run up from the cape to durban
sometim if the land is bad at east london where thei have not
yet made that wonder harbour thei talk so much of and sink such a
mint of monei in a ship is delai for twentyfour hour befor the
cargo boat can get out to take off the good but on thi occas we
had not to wait at all for there were no breaker on the bar to speak
of and the tug came out at onc with the long string of ugli
flatbottom boat behind them into which the packag were bundl
with a crash it did not matter what thei might be over thei went
slapbang whether thei contain china or woollen good thei met with
the same treatment i saw on case hold four dozen of champagn
smash all to bit and there wa the champagn fizz and boil
about in the bottom of the dirti cargo boat it wa a wick wast and
evid so the kafir in the boat thought for thei found a coupl of
unbroken bottl and knock off the neck drank the content but
thei had not allow for the expans caus by the fizz in the wine
and feel themselv swell roll about in the bottom of the
boat call out that the good liquor wa tagatithat is
bewitch i spoke to them from the vessel and told them it wa the
white man strongest medicin and that thei were as good as dead men
those kafir went to the shore in a veri great fright and i do not
think that thei will touch champagn again
well all the time that we were steam up to natal i wa think
over sir henri curtiss offer we did not speak ani more on the subject
for a dai or two though i told them mani hunt yarn all true on
there is no need to tell li about hunt for so mani curiou thing
happen within the knowledg of a man whose busi it is to hunt but
thi is by the wai
at last on beauti even in januari which is our hottest month
we steam past the coast of natal expect to make durban point by
sunset it is a love coast all along from east london with it red
sandhil and wide sweep of vivid green dot here and there with
kafir kraal and border by a ribbon of white surf which spout up
in pillar of foam where it hit the rock but just befor you come to
durban there is a peculiar rich about the landscap there ar the
sheer kloof cut in the hill by the rush rain of centuri down
which the river sparkl there is the deepest green of the bush
grow as god plant it and the other green of the meali garden
and the sugar patch while now and again a white hous smile out
at the placid sea put a finish and give an air of homeli to the
scene for to my mind howev beauti a view mai be it requir the
presenc of man to make it complet but perhap that is becaus i have
live so much in the wilder and therefor know the valu of
civilis though to be sure it drive awai the game the garden of
eden no doubt look fair befor man wa but i alwai think that it
must have been fairer when ev adorn it
to return we had miscalcul a littl and the sun wa well down
befor we drop anchor off the point and heard the gun which told
the good folk of durban that the english mail wa in it wa too late
to think of get over the bar that night so we went comfort to
dinner after see the mail carri off in the lifeboat
when we came up again the moon wa out and shine so brightli over
sea and shore that she almost pale the quick larg flash from the
lighthous from the shore float sweet spici odour that alwai
remind me of hymn and missionari and in the window of the hous
on the berea sparkl a hundr light from a larg brig ly near
also came the music of the sailor as thei work at get the anchor
up in order to be readi for the wind altogeth it wa a perfect
night such a night as you sometim get in southern africa and it
threw a garment of peac over everybodi as the moon threw a garment of
silver over everyth even the great bulldog belong to a sport
passeng seem to yield to it gentl influenc and forget hi
yearn to come to close quarter with the baboon in a cage on the
focsl snore happili at the door of the cabin dream no doubt
that he had finish him and happi in hi dream
we threethat is sir henri curti captain good and myselfw and
sat by the wheel and were quiet for a while
well mr quatermain said sir henri present have you been
think about my propos
ay echo captain good what do you think of them mr quatermain
i hope that you ar go to give us the pleasur of your compani so
far as solomon mine or wherev the gentleman you knew as nevil
mai have got to
i rose and knock out my pipe befor i answer i had not made up my
mind and want an addit moment to decid befor the burn
tobacco had fallen into the sea i had decid just that littl extra
second did the trick it is often the wai when you have been bother
a long time over a thing
ye gentlemen i said sit down again i will go and by your
leav i will tell you why and on what condit first for the term
which i ask
1 you ar to pai all expens and ani ivori or other valuabl we
mai get is to be divid between captain good and myself
2 that you give me 500 for my servic on the trip befor we start
i undertak to serv you faithfulli till you choos to abandon the
enterpris or till we succe or disast overtak us
3 that befor we trek you execut a deed agre in the event of my
death or disabl to pai my boi harri who is studi medicin
over there in london at gui hospit a sum of 200 a year for five
year by which time he ought to be abl to earn a live for himself
if he is worth hi salt that is all i think and i daresai you will
sai quit enough too
no answer sir henri i accept them gladli i am bent upon thi
project and would pai more than that for your help consid the
peculiar and exclus knowledg which you possess
piti i did not ask it then but i wont go back on my word and now
that i have got my term i will tell you my reason for make up my
mind to go first of all gentlemen i have been observ you both for
the last few dai and if you will not think me impertin i mai sai
that i like you and believ that we shall come up well to the yoke
togeth that is someth let me tell you when on ha a long
journei like thi befor on
and now as to the journei itself i tell you flatli sir henri and
captain good that i do not think it probabl we can come out of it
aliv that is if we attempt to cross the suliman mountain what wa
the fate of the old dom da silvestra three hundr year ago what wa
the fate of hi descend twenti year ago what ha been your
brother fate i tell you frankli gentlemen that as their fate were
so i believ our will be
i paus to watch the effect of my word captain good look a littl
uncomfort but sir henri face did not chang we must take our
chanc he said
you mai perhap wonder i went on why if i think thi i who am
as i told you a timid man should undertak such a journei it is for
two reason first i am a fatalist and believ that my time is
appoint to come quit without refer to my own movement and will
and that if i am to go to suliman mountain to be kill i shall go
there and shall be kill god almighti no doubt know hi mind about
me so i need not troubl on that point secondli i am a poor man for
nearli forti year i have hunt and trade but i have never made more
than a live well gentlemen i dont know if you ar awar that the
averag life of an eleph hunter from the time he take to the trade
is between four and five year so you see i have live through about
seven gener of my class and i should think that my time cannot
be far off anywai now if anyth were to happen to me in the
ordinari cours of busi by the time my debt ar paid there would
be noth left to support my son harri whilst he wa get in the
wai of earn a live wherea now he will be set up for five year
there is the whole affair in a nutshel
mr quatermain said sir henri who had been give me hi most
seriou attent your motiv for undertak an enterpris which
you believ can onli end in disast reflect a great deal of credit on
you whether or not you ar right of cours time and the event alon
can show but whether you ar right or wrong i mai as well tell you at
onc that i am go through with it to the end sweet or bitter if we
ar to be knock on the head all i have to sai is that i hope we get
a littl shoot first eh good
ye ye put in the captain we have all three of us been
accustom to face danger and to hold our live in our hand in
variou wai so it is no good turn back now and now i vote we go
down to the saloon and take an observ just for luck you know
and we didthrough the bottom of a tumbler
next dai we went ashor and i put up sir henri and captain good at the
littl shanti i have built on the berea and which i call my home
there ar onli three room and a kitchen in it and it is construct
of green brick with a galvanis iron roof but there is a good garden
with the best loquot tree in it that i know and some nice young
mango of which i hope great thing the curat of the botan
garden gave them to me it is look after by an old hunter of mine
name jack whose thigh wa so badli broken by a buffalo cow in
sikukuni countri that he will never hunt again but he can potter
about and garden be a griqua by birth you will never persuad a
zulu to take much interest in garden it is a peac art and
peac art ar not in hi line
sir henri and good slept in a tent pitch in my littl grove of orang
tree at the end of the garden for there wa no room for them in the
hous and what with the smell of the bloom and the sight of the green
and golden fruitin durban you will see all three on the tree
togetheri daresai it is a pleasant place enough for we have few
mosquito here on the berea unless there happen to come an unusu
heavi rain
well to get onfor if i do not harri you will be tire of my stori
befor ever we fetch up at suliman mountainshav onc made up my
mind to go i set about make the necessari prepar first i
secur the deed from sir henri provid for you my boi in case of
accid there wa some difficulti about it legal execut as sir
henri wa a stranger here and the properti to be charg is over the
water but it wa ultim got over with the help of a lawyer who
charg 20 for the joba price that i thought outrag then i
pocket my chequ for 500
have paid thi tribut to my bump of caution i purchas a wagon and
a span of oxen on sir henri behalf and beauti thei were it wa a
twentytwofoot wagon with iron axl veri strong veri light and
built throughout of stink wood not quit a new on have been to the
diamond field and back but in my opinion all the better for that
for i could see that the wood wa well season if anyth is go
to give in a wagon or if there is green wood in it it will show out
on the first trip thi particular vehicl wa what we call a
halftent wagon that is to sai onli cover in over the after
twelv feet leav all the front part free for the necessari we had
to carri with us in thi after part were a hide cartl or bed on
which two peopl could sleep also rack for rifl and mani other
littl conveni i gave 125 for it and think that it wa cheap at
the price
then i bought a beauti team of twenti zulu oxen which i had kept my
ey on for a year or two sixteen oxen is the usual number for a team
but i took four extra to allow for casualti these zulu cattl ar
small and light not more than half the size of the africand oxen
which ar gener us for transport purpos but thei will live
where the africand would starv and with a moder load can make
five mile a dai better go be quicker and not so liabl to
becom footsor what is more thi lot were thoroughli salt that
is thei had work all over south africa and so had becom proof
compar speak against red water which so frequent destroi
whole team of oxen when thei get on to strang veldt or grass
countri as for lung sick which is a dread form of pneumonia
veri preval in thi countri thei had all been inocul against
it thi is done by cut a slit in the tail of an ox and bind in
a piec of the diseas lung of an anim which ha di of the
sick the result is that the ox sicken take the diseas in a
mild form which caus it tail to drop off as a rule about a foot
from the root and becom proof against futur attack it seem cruel
to rob the anim of hi tail especi in a countri where there ar
so mani fli but it is better to sacrific the tail and keep the ox
than to lose both tail and ox for a tail without an ox is not much
good except to dust with still it doe look odd to trek along behind
twenti stump where there ought to be tail it seem as though natur
made a trifl mistak and stuck the stern ornament of a lot of
prize bulldog on to the rump of the oxen
next came the question of provis and medicin on which
requir the most care consider for what we had to do wa to
avoid lumber the wagon and yet to take everyth absolut
necessari fortun it turn out that good is a bit of a doctor
have at some point in hi previou career manag to pass through a
cours of medic and surgic instruct which he ha more or less
kept up he is not of cours qualifi but he know more about it
than mani a man who can write md after hi name as we found out
afterward and he had a splendid travel medicin chest and a set
of instrument whilst we were at durban he cut off a kafir big toe
in a wai which it wa a pleasur to see but he wa quit nonpluss
when the kafir who had sat stolidli watch the oper ask him
to put on anoth sai that a white on would do at a pinch
there remain when these question were satisfactorili settl two
further import point for consider name that of arm and
that of servant as to the arm i cannot do better than put down a
list of those which we final decid on from among the ampl store
that sir henri had brought with him from england and those which i
own i copi it from my pocketbook where i made the entri at the
time
three heavi breechload doubleeight eleph gun weigh about
fifteen pound each to carri a charg of eleven drachm of black
powder two of these were by a wellknown london firm most excel
maker but i do not know by whom mine which is not so highli
finish wa made i have us it on sever trip and shot a good
mani eleph with it and it ha alwai prove a most superior
weapon thoroughli to be reli on
three double500 express construct to stand a charg of six
drachm sweet weapon and admir for mediums game such as
eland or sabl antelop or for men especi in an open countri and
with the semihollow bullet
on doubl no 12 centralfir keeper shotgun full choke both
barrel thi gun prove of the greatest servic to us afterward in
shoot game for the pot
three winchest repeat rifl not carbin spare gun
three singleact colt revolv with the heavier or american
pattern of cartridg
thi wa our total armament and doubtless the reader will observ that
the weapon of each class were of the same make and calibr so that
the cartridg were interchang a veri import point i make no
apolog for detail it at length as everi experienc hunter will
know how vital a proper suppli of gun and ammunit is to the success
of an expedit
now as to the men who were to go with us after much consult we
decid that their number should be limit to five name a driver
a leader and three servant
the driver and leader i found without much difficulti two zulu name
respect goza and tom but to get the servant prove a more
difficult matter it wa necessari that thei should be thoroughli
trustworthi and brave men as in a busi of thi sort our live
might depend upon their conduct at last i secur two on a hottentot
name ventvgel or windbird and on a littl zulu name khiva who
had the merit of speak english perfectli ventvgel i had known
befor he wa on of the most perfect spoorer that is game
tracker i ever had to do with and tough as whipcord he never seem
to tire but he had on fail so common with hi race drink put
him within reach of a bottl of gin and you could not trust him
howev as we were go beyond the region of grogshop thi littl
weak of hi did not so much matter
have secur these two men i look in vain for a third to suit my
purpos so we determin to start without on trust to luck to
find a suitabl man on our wai up countri but as it happen on the
even befor the dai we had fix for our departur the zulu khiva
inform me that a kafir wa wait to see me accordingli when we
had done dinner for we were at tabl at the time i told khiva to
bring him in present a tall handsomelook man somewher about
thirti year of ag and veri lightcolour for a zulu enter and
lift hi knobstick by wai of salut squat himself down in the
corner on hi haunch and sat silent i did not take ani notic of
him for a while for it is a great mistak to do so if you rush into
convers at onc a zulu is apt to think you a person of littl
digniti or consequ i observ howev that he wa a keshla or
ring man that is he wore on hi head the black ring made of a
speci of gum polish with fat and work up in the hair which is
usual assum by zulu on attain a certain ag or digniti also it
struck me that hi face wa familiar to me
well i said at last what is your name
umbopa answer the man in a slow deep voic
i have seen your face befor
ye the inkoosi the chief my father saw my face at the place of
the littl handthat is isandhlwanaon the dai befor the battl
then i rememb i wa on of lord chelmsford guid in that
unlucki zulu war and had the good fortun to leav the camp in charg
of some wagon on the dai befor the battl while i wa wait for
the cattl to be inspan i fell into convers with thi man who
held some small command among the nativ auxiliari and he had
express to me hi doubt as to the safeti of the camp at the time i
told him to hold hi tongu and leav such matter to wiser head but
afterward i thought of hi word
i rememb i said what is it you want
it is thi macumazahn that is my kafir name and mean the man
who get up in the middl of the night or in vulgar english he who
keep hi ey open i hear that you go on a great expedit far into
the north with the white chief from over the water is it a true word
it is
i hear that you go even to the lukanga river a moon journei beyond
the manica countri is thi so also macumazahn
why do you ask whither we go what is it to you i answer
suspici for the object of our journei had been kept a dead
secret
it is thi o white men that if inde you travel so far i would
travel with you
there wa a certain assumpt of digniti in the man mode of speech
and especi in hi us of the word o white men instead of o
inkosi or chief which struck me
you forget yourself a littl i said your word run out unawar
that is not the wai to speak what is your name and where is your
kraal tell us that we mai know with whom we have to deal
my name is umbopa i am of the zulu peopl yet not of them the hous
of my tribe is in the far north it wa left behind when the zulu came
down here a thousand year ago long befor chaka reign in
zululand i have no kraal i have wander for mani year i came from
the north as a child to zululand i wa cetewayo man in the
nkomabakosi regiment serv there under the great captain
umslopogaasi of the axe1 who taught my hand to fight afterward i
ran awai from zululand and came to natal becaus i want to see the
white man wai next i fought against cetewayo in the war sinc then
i have been work in natal now i am tire and would go north again
here is not my place i want no monei but i am a brave man and am
worth my place and meat i have spoken
i wa rather puzzl by thi man and hi wai of speech it wa evid
to me from hi manner that in the main he wa tell the truth but
somehow he seem differ from the ordinari run of zulu and i
rather mistrust hi offer to come without pai be in a difficulti
i translat hi word to sir henri and good and ask them their
opinion
sir henri told me to ask him to stand up umbopa did so at the same
time slip off the long militari great coat which he wore and
reveal himself nake except for the moocha round hi centr and a
necklac of lion claw certainli he wa a magnificentlook man i
never saw a finer nativ stand about six foot three high he wa
broad in proport and veri shape in that light too hi skin
look scarc more than dark except here and there where deep black
scar mark old assegai wound sir henri walk up to him and look
into hi proud handsom face
thei make a good pair dont thei said good on as big as the
other
i like your look mr umbopa and i will take you as my servant
said sir henri in english
umbopa evid understood him for he answer in zulu it is well
and then ad with a glanc at the white man great statur and
breadth we ar men thou and i

and the want of water on strai and the other three di from
eat the poison herb call tulip five more sicken from thi
caus but we manag to cure them with dose of an infus made by
boil down the tulip leav if administ in time thi is a veri
effect antidot
the wagon and the oxen we left in the immedi charg of goza and tom
our driver and leader both trustworthi boi request a worthi
scotch missionari who live in thi distant place to keep an ey on
them then accompani by umbopa khiva ventvgel and half a dozen
bearer whom we hire on the spot we start off on foot upon our wild
quest i rememb we were all a littl silent on the occas of thi
departur and i think that each of us wa wonder if we should ever
see our wagon again for my part i never expect to do so for a while
we tramp on in silenc till umbopa who wa march in front broke
into a zulu chant about how some brave men tire of life and the
tame of thing start off into a vast wilder to find new
thing or die and how lo and behold when thei had travel far into
the wilder thei found that it wa not a wilder at all but a
beauti place full of young wive and fat cattl of game to hunt and
enemi to kill
then we all laugh and took it for a good omen umbopa wa a cheer
savag in a dignifi sort of wai when he wa not suffer from on
of hi fit of brood and he had a wonder knack of keep up our
spirit we all grew veri fond of him
and now for the on adventur to which i am go to treat myself for
i do dearli love a hunt yarn
about a fortnight march from inyati we came across a peculiarli
beauti bit of wellwat woodland countri the kloof in the hill
were cover with dens bush idoro bush as the nativ call it and
in some place with the wachteenbech or waitalittl thorn
and there were great quantiti of the love machabel tree laden
with refresh yellow fruit have enorm stone thi tree is the
eleph favourit food and there were not want sign that the
great brute had been about for not onli wa their spoor frequent but
in mani place the tree were broken down and even uproot the
eleph is a destruct feeder
on even after a long dai march we came to a spot of great
loveli at the foot of a bushclad hill lai a dry riverb in
which howev were to be found pool of crystal water all trodden
round with the hoofprint of game face thi hill wa a parklik
plain where grew clump of flattop mimosa vari with occasion
glossyleav machabel and all round stretch the sea of pathless
silent bush
as we emerg into thi riverb path suddenli we start a troop of
tall giraff who gallop or rather sail off in their strang
gait their tail screw up over their back and their hoof rattl
like castanet thei were about three hundr yard from us and
therefor practic out of shot but good who wa walk ahead and
who had an express load with solid ball in hi hand could not resist
temptat lift hi gun he let drive at the last a young cow by
some extraordinari chanc the ball struck it full on the back of the
neck shatter the spinal column and that giraff went roll head
over heel just like a rabbit i never saw a more curiou thing
curs it said goodfor i am sorri to sai he had a habit of us
strong languag when excitedcontract no doubt in the cours of
hi nautic career curs it iv kill him
ou bougwan ejacul the kafir ou ou
thei call good bougwan or glass ey becaus of hi eyeglass
oh bougwan reecho sir henri and i and from that dai good
reput as a marvel shot wa establish at ani rate among the
kafir realli he wa a bad on but whenev he miss we overlook
it for the sake of that giraff
have set some of the boi to cut off the best of the giraff
meat we went to work to build a scherm near on of the pool and
about a hundr yard to it right thi is done by cut a quantiti
of thorn bush and pile them in the shape of a circular hedg then
the space enclos is smooth and dry tambouki grass if obtain
is made into a bed in the centr and a fire or fire light
by the time the scherm wa finish the moon peep up and our
dinner of giraff steak and roast marrowbon were readi how we
enjoi those marrowbon though it wa rather a job to crack them i
know of no greater luxuri than giraff marrow unless it is eleph
heart and we had that on the morrow we at our simpl meal by the
light of the moon paus at time to thank good for hi wonder
shot then we began to smoke and yarn and a curiou pictur we must
have made squat there round the fire i with my short grizzl
hair stick up straight and sir henri with hi yellow lock which
were get rather long were rather a contrast especi as i am
thin and short and dark weigh onli nine stone and a half and sir
henri is tall and broad and fair and weigh fifteen but perhap the
most curiouslook of the three take all the circumst of the
case into consider wa captain john good rn there he sat upon
a leather bag look just as though he had come in from a comfort
dai shoot in a civilis countri absolut clean tidi and well
dress he wore a shoot suit of brown tweed with a hat to match
and neat gaiter as usual he wa beautifulli shave hi eyeglass
and hi fals teeth appear to be in perfect order and altogeth he
look the neatest man i ever had to do with in the wilder he even
sport a collar of which he had a suppli made of white guttapercha
you see thei weigh so littl he said to me innoc when i
express my astonish at the fact and i alwai like to turn out
like a gentleman ah if he could have foreseen the futur and the
raiment prepar for him
well there we three sat yarn awai in the beauti moonlight and
watch the kafir a few yard off suck their intox daccha
from a pipe of which the mouthpiec wa made of the horn of an eland
till on by on thei roll themselv up in their blanket and went to
sleep by the fire that is all except umbopa who wa a littl apart
hi chin rest on hi hand and think deepli i notic that he
never mix much with the other kafir
present from the depth of the bush behind us came a loud woof
woof that a lion said i and we all start up to listen
hardli had we done so when from the pool about a hundr yard off
we heard the strident trumpet of an eleph unkungunklovo
indlovu eleph eleph whisper the kafir and a few
minut afterward we saw a success of vast shadowi form move
slowli from the direct of the water toward the bush
up jump good burn for slaughter and think perhap that it
wa as easi to kill eleph as he had found it to shoot giraff but i
caught him by the arm and pull him down
it no good i whisper let them go
it seem that we ar in a paradis of game i vote we stop here a dai
or two and have a go at them said sir henri present
i wa rather surpris for hitherto sir henri had alwai been for
push forward as fast as possibl more especi sinc we
ascertain at inyati that about two year ago an englishman of the
name of nevil had sold hi wagon there and gone on up countri but
i suppos hi hunter instinct got the better of him for a while
good jump at the idea for he wa long to have a shot at those
eleph and so to speak the truth did i for it went against my
conscienc to let such a herd as that escap without a pull at them
all right my hearti said i i think we want a littl recreat
and now let turn in for we ought to be off by dawn and then perhap
we mai catch them feed befor thei move on
the other agre and we proceed to make our prepar good took
off hi cloth shook them put hi eyeglass and hi fals teeth into
hi trouser pocket and fold each articl neatli place it out of
the dew under a corner of hi mackintosh sheet sir henri and i
content ourselv with rougher arrang and soon were curl up
in our blanket and drop off into the dreamless sleep that reward
the travel
go go gowhat wa that
suddenli from the direct of the water came sound of violent
scuffl and next instant there broke upon our ear a success of
the most aw roar there wa no mistak their origin onli a lion
could make such a nois as that we all jump up and look toward
the water in the direct of which we saw a confus mass yellow and
black in colour stagger and struggl toward us we seiz our
rifl and slip on our veldtschoon that is shoe made of
untan hide ran out of the scherm by thi time the mass had fallen
and wa roll over and over on the ground and when we reach the
spot it struggl no longer but lai quit still
now we saw what it wa on the grass there lai a sabl antelop
bullth most beauti of all the african antelopesquit dead and
transfix by it great curv horn wa a magnific blackman
lion also dead evid what had happen wa thi the sabl
antelop had come down to drink at the pool where the lionno doubt
the same which we had heardwa ly in wait while the antelop
drank the lion had sprung upon him onli to be receiv upon the sharp
curv horn and transfix onc befor i saw a similar thing happen
then the lion unabl to free himself had torn and bitten at the back
and neck of the bull which madden with fear and pain had rush on
until it drop dead
as soon as we had examin the beast suffici we call the
kafir and between us manag to drag their carcas up to the scherm
after that we went in and lai down to wake no more till dawn
with the first light we were up and make readi for the frai we took
with us the three eightbor rifl a good suppli of ammunit and
our larg waterbottl fill with weak cold tea which i have alwai
found the best stuff to shoot on after swallow a littl breakfast
we start umbopa khiva and ventvgel accompani us the other
kafir we left with instruct to skin the lion and the sabl
antelop and to cut up the latter
we had no difficulti in find the broad eleph trail which
ventvgel after examin pronounc to have been made by between
twenti and thirti eleph most of them fullgrown bull but the
herd had move on some wai dure the night and it wa nine oclock
and alreadi veri hot befor by the broken tree bruis leav and
bark and smoke drop we knew that we could not be far from them
present we caught sight of the herd which number as ventvgel had
said between twenti and thirti stand in a hollow have finish
their morn meal and flap their great ear it wa a splendid
sight for thei were onli about two hundr yard from us take a
hand of dry grass i threw it into the air to see how the wind wa
for if onc thei wind us i knew thei would be off befor we could get
a shot find that if anyth it blew from the eleph to us we
crept on stealthili and thank to the cover manag to get within
forti yard or so of the great brute just in front of us and
broadsid on stood three splendid bull on of them with enorm
tusk i whisper to the other that i would take the middl on sir
henri cover the eleph to the left and good the bull with the big
tusk
now i whisper
boom boom boom went the three heavi rifl and down came sir
henri eleph dead as a hammer shot right through the heart mine
fell on to it knee and i thought that he wa go to die but in
anoth moment he wa up and off tear along straight past me as he
went i gave him the second barrel in the rib and thi brought him
down in good earnest hastili slip in two fresh cartridg i ran
close up to him and a ball through the brain put an end to the poor
brute struggl then i turn to see how good had fare with the big
bull which i had heard scream with rage and pain as i gave mine it
quietu on reach the captain i found him in a great state of
excit it appear that on receiv the bullet the bull had
turn and come straight for hi assail who had bare time to get
out of hi wai and then charg on blindli past him in the direct
of our encamp meanwhil the herd had crash off in wild alarm in
the other direct
for awhil we debat whether to go after the wound bull or to follow
the herd and final decid for the latter altern depart
think that we had seen the last of those big tusk i have often
wish sinc that we had it wa easi work to follow the eleph for
thei had left a trail like a carriag road behind them crush down
the thick bush in their furiou flight as though it were tambouki grass
but to come up with them wa anoth matter and we had struggl on
under the broil sun for over two hour befor we found them with
the except of on bull thei were stand togeth and i could
see from their unquiet wai and the manner in which thei kept lift
their trunk to test the air that thei were on the lookout for
mischief the solitari bull stood fifti yard or so to thi side of the
herd over which he wa evid keep sentri and about sixti yard
from us think that he would see or wind us and that it would
probabl start them off again if we tri to get nearer especi as
the ground wa rather open we all aim at thi bull and at my
whisper word we fire the three shot took effect and down he went
dead again the herd start but unfortun for them about a
hundr yard further on wa a nullah or driedout water track with
steep bank a place veri much resembl the on where the princ
imperi wa kill in zululand into thi the eleph plung and
when we reach the edg we found them struggl in wild confus to
get up the other bank fill the air with their scream and
trumpet as thei push on anoth asid in their selfish panic
just like so mani human be now wa our opportun and fire
awai as quickli as we could load we kill five of the poor beast
and no doubt should have bag the whole herd had thei not suddenli
given up their attempt to climb the bank and rush headlong down the
nullah we were too tire to follow them and perhap also a littl
sick of slaughter eight eleph be a pretti good bag for on dai
so after we were rest a littl and the kafir had cut out the heart
of two of the dead eleph for supper we start homeward veri
well pleas with our dai work have made up our mind to send the
bearer on the morrow to chop awai the tusk
shortli after we repass the spot where good had wound the
patriarch bull we came across a herd of eland but did not shoot at
them as we had plenti of meat thei trot past us and then stop
behind a littl patch of bush about a hundr yard awai wheel
round to look at us as good wa anxiou to get a near view of them
never have seen an eland close he hand hi rifl to umbopa and
follow by khiva stroll up to the patch of bush we sat down and
wait for him not sorri of the excus for a littl rest
the sun wa just go down in it reddest glori and sir henri and i
were admir the love scene when suddenli we heard an eleph
scream and saw it huge and rush form with uplift trunk and tail
silhouet against the great fieri globe of the sun next second we
saw someth els and that wa good and khiva tear back toward us
with the wound bullfor it wa hecharg after them for a moment
we did not dare to firethough at that distanc it would have been of
littl us if we had done sofor fear of hit on of them and the
next a dread thing happenedgood fell a victim to hi passion for
civilis dress had he consent to discard hi trouser and gaiter
like the rest of us and to hunt in a flannel shirt and a pair of
veldtschoon it would have been all right but as it wa hi
trouser cumber him in that desper race and present when he
wa about sixti yard from us hi boot polish by the dry grass
slip and down he went on hi face right in front of the eleph
we gave a gasp for we knew that he must die and ran as hard as we
could toward him in three second it had end but not as we
thought khiva the zulu boi saw hi master fall and brave lad as he
wa turn and flung hi assegai straight into the eleph face it
stuck in hi trunk
with a scream of pain the brute seiz the poor zulu hurl him to
the earth and place on huge foot on to hi bodi about the middl
twine it trunk round hi upper part and tore him in two
we rush up mad with horror and fire again and again till present
the eleph fell upon the fragment of the zulu
as for good he rose and wrung hi hand over the brave man who had
given hi life to save him and though i am an old hand i felt a lump
grow in my throat umbopa stood contempl the huge dead eleph
and the mangl remain of poor khiva
ah well he said present he is dead but he di like a man
chapter v
our march into the desert
we had kill nine eleph and it took us two dai to cut out the
tusk and have brought them into camp to buri them carefulli in the
sand under a larg tree which made a conspicu mark for mile round
it wa a wonderfulli fine lot of ivori i never saw a better averag
as it did between forti and fifti pound a tusk the tusk of the great
bull that kill poor khiva scale on hundr and seventi pound the
pair so nearli as we could judg
as for khiva himself we buri what remain of him in an antbear
hole togeth with an assegai to protect himself with on hi journei
to a better world on the third dai we march again hope that we
might live to return to dig up our buri ivori and in due cours
after a long and wearisom tramp and mani adventur which i have not
space to detail we reach sitanda kraal near the lukanga river
the real startingpoint of our expedit veri well do i recollect our
arriv at that place to the right wa a scatter nativ settlement
with a few stone cattl kraal and some cultiv land down by the
water where these savag grew their scanti suppli of grain and
beyond it stretch great tract of wave veld cover with tall
grass over which herd of the smaller game were wander to the left
lai the vast desert thi spot appear to be the outpost of the fertil
countri and it would be difficult to sai to what natur caus such
an abrupt chang in the charact of the soil is due but so it is
just below our encamp flow a littl stream on the farther side
of which is a stoni slope the same down which twenti year befor i
had seen poor silvestr creep back after hi attempt to reach
solomon mine and beyond that slope begin the waterless desert
cover with a speci of karoo shrub
it wa even when we pitch our camp and the great ball of the sun
wa sink into the desert send gloriou rai of manycolour
light fly all over it vast expans leav good to superintend the
arrang of our littl camp i took sir henri with me and walk
to the top of the slope opposit we gaze across the desert the air
wa veri clear and far far awai i could distinguish the faint blue
outlin here and there cap with white of the suliman berg
there i said there is the wall round solomon mine but god
know if we shall ever climb it
my brother should be there and if he is i shall reach him somehow
said sir henri in that tone of quiet confid which mark the man
i hope so i answer and turn to go back to the camp when i saw
that we were not alon behind us also gaze earnestli toward the
faroff mountain stood the great kafir umbopa
the zulu spoke when he saw that i had observ him address sir
henri to whom he had attach himself
is it to that land that thou wouldst journei incubu a nativ word
mean i believ an eleph and the name given to sir henri by the
kafir he said point toward the mountain with hi broad assegai
i ask him sharpli what he meant by address hi master in that
familiar wai it is veri well for nativ to have a name for on among
themselv but it is not decent that thei should call a white man by
their heathenish appel to hi face the zulu laugh a quiet
littl laugh which anger me
how dost thou know that i am not the equal of the inkosi whom i
serv he said he is of a royal hous no doubt on can see it in
hi size and by hi mien so mayhap am i at least i am as great a
man be my mouth o macumazahn and sai my word to the inkoo incubu
my master for i would speak to him and to thee
i wa angri with the man for i am not accustom to be talk to in
that wai by kafir but somehow he impress me and besid i wa
curiou to know what he had to sai so i translat express my
opinion at the same time that he wa an impud fellow and that hi
swagger wa outrag
ye umbopa answer sir henri i would journei there
the desert is wide and there is no water in it the mountain ar high
and cover with snow and man cannot sai what li beyond them behind
the place where the sun set how shalt thou come thither incubu and
wherefor dost thou go
i translat again
tell him answer sir henri that i go becaus i believ that a man
of my blood my brother ha gone there befor me and i journei to
seek him
that is so incubu a hottentot i met on the road told me that a white
man went out into the desert two year ago toward those mountain with
on servant a hunter thei never came back
how do you know it wa my brother ask sir henri
nai i know not but the hottentot when i ask what the white man
wa like said that he had thine ey and a black beard he said too
that the name of the hunter with him wa jim that he wa a bechuana
hunter and wore cloth
there is no doubt about it said i i knew jim well
sir henri nod i wa sure of it he said if georg set hi mind
upon a thing he gener did it it wa alwai so from hi boyhood if
he meant to cross the suliman berg he ha cross it unless some
accid overtook him and we must look for him on the other side
umbopa understood english though he rare spoke it
it is a far journei incubu he put in and i translat hi remark
ye answer sir henri it is far but there is no journei upon
thi earth that a man mai not make if he set hi heart to it there is
noth umbopa that he cannot do there ar no mountain he mai not
climb there ar no desert he cannot cross save a mountain and a
desert of which you ar spare the knowledg if love lead him and he
hold hi life in hi hand count it as noth readi to keep it or
lose it as heaven abov mai order
i translat
great word my father answer the zului alwai call him a
zulu though he wa not realli onegreat swell word fit to fill
the mouth of a man thou art right my father incubu listen what is
life it is a feather it is the seed of the grass blown hither and
thither sometim multipli itself and dy in the act sometim
carri awai into the heaven but if that seed be good and heavi it
mai perchanc travel a littl wai on the road it will it is well to
try and journei on road and to fight with the air man must die at
the worst he can but die a littl sooner i will go with thee across
the desert and over the mountain unless perchanc i fall to the
ground on the wai my father
he paus awhil and then went on with on of those strang burst of
rhetor eloqu that zulu sometim indulg in which to my mind
full though thei ar of vain repetit show that the race is by no
mean devoid of poetic instinct and of intellectu power
what is life tell me o white men who ar wise who know the secret
of the world and of the world of star and the world that li abov
and around the star who flash your word from afar without a voic
tell me white men the secret of our lifewhith it goe and whenc
it come
you cannot answer me you know not listen i will answer out of the
dark we came into the dark we go like a stormdriven bird at night we
fly out of the nowher for a moment our wing ar seen in the light of
the fire and lo we ar gone again into the nowher life is noth
life is all it is the hand with which we hold off death it is the
glowworm that shine in the nighttim and is black in the morn it
is the white breath of the oxen in winter it is the littl shadow that
run across the grass and lose itself at sunset
you ar a strang man said sir henri when he had ceas
umbopa laugh it seem to me that we ar much alik incubu perhap
i seek a brother over the mountain
i look at him suspici what dost thou mean i ask what
dost thou know of those mountain
a littl a veri littl there is a strang land yonder a land of
witchcraft and beauti thing a land of brave peopl and of tree
and stream and snowi peak and of a great white road i have heard
of it but what is the good of talk it grow dark those who live
to see will see
again i look at him doubtfulli the man knew too much
you need not fear me macumazahn he said interpret my look i
dig no hole for you to fall in i make no plot if ever we cross
those mountain behind the sun i will tell what i know but death sit
upon them be wise and turn back go and hunt eleph my master i
have spoken
and without anoth word he lift hi spear in salut and
return toward the camp where shortli afterward we found him
clean a gun like ani other kafir
that is an odd man said sir henri
ye answer i too odd by half i dont like hi littl wai he
know someth and will not speak out but i suppos it is no us
quarrel with him we ar in for a curiou trip and a mysteri
zulu wont make much differ on wai or anoth
next dai we made our arrang for start of cours it wa
imposs to drag our heavi eleph rifl and other kit with us
across the desert so dismiss our bearer we made an arrang
with an old nativ who had a kraal close by to take care of them till
we return it went to my heart to leav such thing as those sweet
tool to the tender merci of an old thief of a savag whose greedi
ey i could see gloat over them but i took some precaut
first of all i load all the rifl place them at full cock and
inform him that if he touch them thei would go off he tri the
experi instantli with my eightbor and it did go off and blew a
hole right through on of hi oxen which were just then be driven
up to the kraal to sai noth of knock him head over heel with
the recoil he got up consider startl and not at all pleas at
the loss of the ox which he had the impud to ask me to pai for
and noth would induc him to touch the gun again
put the live devil out of the wai up there in the thatch he said
or thei will murder us all
then i told him that when we came back if on of those thing wa
miss i would kill him and hi peopl by witchcraft and if we di
and he tri to steal the rifl i would come and haunt him and turn
hi cattl mad and hi milk sour till life wa a weari and would
make the devil in the gun come out and talk to him in a wai he did
not like and gener gave him a good idea of judgment to come after
that he promis to look after them as though thei were hi father
spirit he wa a veri superstiti old kafir and a great villain
have thu dispos of our superflu gear we arrang the kit we
fivesir henri good myself umbopa and the hottentot
ventvgelwer to take with us on our journei it wa small enough
but do what we would we could not get it weight down under about forti
pound a man thi is what it consist of
the three express rifl and two hundr round of ammunit
the two winchest repeat rifl for umbopa and ventvgel with
two hundr round of cartridg
five cochran waterbottl each hold four pint
five blanket
twentyf pound weight of biltongi sundri game flesh
ten pound weight of best mix bead for gift
a select of medicin includ an ounc of quinin and on or two
small surgic instrument
our knive a few sundri such as a compass match a pocket
filter tobacco a trowel a bottl of brandi and the cloth we stood
in
thi wa our total equip a small on inde for such a ventur
but we dare not attempt to carri more inde that load wa a heavi
on per man with which to travel across the burn desert for in such
place everi addit ounc tell but we could not see our wai to
reduc the weight there wa noth taken but what wa absolut
necessari
with great difficulti and by the promis of a present of a good
huntingknif each i succeed in persuad three wretch nativ
from the villag to come with us for the first stage twenti mile and
to carri a larg gourd hold a gallon of water apiec my object wa
to enabl us to refil our waterbottl after the first night march
for we determin to start in the cool of the even i gave out to
these nativ that we were go to shoot ostrich with which the
desert abound thei jabber and shrug their shoulder sai
that we were mad and should perish of thirst which i must sai seem
probabl but be desir of obtain the knive which were almost
unknown treasur up there thei consent to come have probabl
reflect that after all our subsequ extinct would be no affair
of their
all next dai we rest and slept and at sunset at a hearti meal of
fresh beef wash down with tea the last as good remark sadli we
were like to drink for mani a long dai then have made our final
prepar we lai down and wait for the moon to rise at last
about nine oclock up she came in all her glori flood the wild
countri with light and throw a silver sheen on the expans of
roll desert befor us which look as solemn and quiet and as alien
to man as the starstud firmament abov we rose up and in a few
minut were readi and yet we hesit a littl as human natur is
prone to hesit on the threshold of an irrevoc step we three
white men stood by ourselv umbopa assegai in hand and a rifl
across hi shoulder look out fixedli across the desert a few pace
ahead of us while the hire nativ with the gourd of water and
ventvgel were gather in a littl knot behind
gentlemen said sir henri present in hi deep voic we ar go
on about as strang a journei as men can make in thi world it is veri
doubt if we can succe in it but we ar three men who will stand
togeth for good or for evil to the last now befor we start let us
for a moment prai to the power who shape the destini of men and who
ag sinc ha mark out our path that it mai pleas him to direct
our step in accord with hi will
take off hi hat for the space of a minut or so he cover hi
face with hi hand and good and i did likewis
i do not sai that i am a firstrat prai man few hunter ar and
as for sir henri i never heard him speak like that befor and onli
onc sinc though deep down in hi heart i believ that he is veri
religi good too is piou though apt to swear anyhow i do not
rememb except on on singl occas ever put up a better
prayer in my life than i did dure that minut and somehow i felt the
happier for it our futur wa so complet unknown and i think that
the unknown and the aw alwai bring a man nearer to hi maker
and now said sir henri trek
so we start
we had noth to guid ourselv by except the distant mountain and
old jo da silvestr chart which consid that it wa drawn by
a dy and halfdistraught man on a fragment of linen three centuri
ago wa not a veri satisfactori sort of thing with work with still
our sole hope of success depend upon it such as it wa if we fail
in find that pool of bad water which the old dom mark as be
situat in the middl of the desert about sixti mile from our
startingpoint and as far from the mountain in all probabl we
must perish miser of thirst but to my mind the chanc of our
find it in that great sea of sand and karoo scrub seem almost
infinitesim even suppos that da silvestra had mark the pool
correctli what wa there to prevent it have been dri up by the
sun gener ago or trampl in by game or fill with the
drift sand
on we tramp silent as shade through the night and in the heavi
sand the karoo bush caught our feet and retard us and the sand
work into our veldtschoon and good shootingboot so that everi
few mile we had to stop and empti them but still the night kept
fairli cool though the atmospher wa thick and heavi give a sort
of creami feel to the air and we made fair progress it wa veri
silent and lone there in the desert oppress so inde good
felt thi and onc began to whistl the girl i left behind me but
the note sound lugubri in that vast place and he gave it up
shortli afterward a littl incid occur which though it startl
us at the time gave rise to a laugh good wa lead as the holder
of the compass which be a sailor of cours he understood
thoroughli and we were toil along in singl file behind him when
suddenli we heard the sound of an exclam and he vanish next
second there aros all around us a most extraordinari hubbub snort
groan and wild sound of rush feet in the faint light too we
could descri dim gallop form half hidden by wreath of sand the
nativ threw down their load and prepar to bolt but rememb
that there wa nowher to run to thei cast themselv upon the ground
and howl out that it wa ghost as for sir henri and myself we
stood amaz nor wa our amaz lessen when we perceiv the form
of good career off in the direct of the mountain appar
mount on the back of a hors and halloa wildli in anoth second
he threw up hi arm and we heard him come to the earth with a thud
then i saw what had happen we had stumbl upon a herd of sleep
quagga on to the back of on of which good actual had fallen and
the brute natur enough got up and made off with him call out to
the other that it wa all right i ran toward good much afraid lest
he should be hurt but to my great relief i found him sit in the
sand hi eyeglass still fix firmli in hi ey rather shaken and
veri much frighten but not in ani wai injur
after thi we travel on without ani further misadventur till about
on oclock when we call a halt and have drunk a littl water
not much for water wa preciou and rest for half an hour we
start again
on on we went till at last the east began to blush like the cheek of
a girl then there came faint rai of primros light that chang
present to golden bar through which the dawn glide out across the
desert the star grew pale and paler still till at last thei
vanish the golden moon wax wan and her mountain ridg stood out
against her sickli face like the bone on the cheek of a dy man
then came spear upon spear of light flash far awai across the
boundless wilder pierc and fire the veil of mist till the
desert wa drape in a tremul golden glow and it wa dai
still we did not halt though by thi time we should have been glad
enough to do so for we knew that when onc the sun wa fulli up it
would be almost imposs for us to travel at length about an hour
later we spi a littl pile of boulder rise out of the plain and
to thi we drag ourselv as luck would have it here we found an
overhang slab of rock carpet beneath with smooth sand which
afford a most grate shelter from the heat underneath thi we
crept and each of us have drunk some water and eaten a bit of
biltong we lai down and soon were sound asleep
it wa three oclock in the afternoon befor we woke to find our
bearer prepar to return thei had seen enough of the desert
alreadi and no number of knive would have tempt them to come a step
farther so we took a hearti drink and have empti our
waterbottl fill them up again from the gourd that thei had
brought with them and then watch them depart on their twenti mile
tramp home
at halfpast four we also start it wa lone and desol work for
with the except of a few ostrich there wa not a singl live
creatur to be seen on all the vast expans of sandi plain evid
it wa too dry for game and with the except of a deadlylook
cobra or two we saw no reptil on insect howev we found
abund and that wa the common or hous fly there thei came not
as singl spi but in battalion as i think the old testament1
sai somewher he is an extraordinari insect is the hous fly go
where you will you find him and so it must have been alwai i have
seen him enclos in amber which is i wa told quit half a million
year old look exactli like hi descend of todai and i have
littl doubt but that when the last man li dy on the earth he will
be buzz roundif thi event happen to occur in summerwatch
for an opportun to settl on hi nose
at sunset we halt wait for the moon to rise at last she came up
beauti and seren as ever and with on halt about two oclock in
the morn we trudg on wearili through the night till at last the
welcom sun put a period to our labour we drank a littl and flung
ourselv down on the sand thoroughli tire out and soon were all
asleep there wa no need to set a watch for we had noth to fear
from anybodi or anyth in that vast unten plain our onli
enemi were heat thirst and fli but far rather would i have face
ani danger from man or beast than that aw triniti thi time we were
not so lucki as to find a shelter rock to guard us from the glare of
the sun with the result that about seven oclock we woke up
experienc the exact sensat on would attribut to a beefsteak on
a gridiron we were liter be bake through and through the
burn sun seem to be suck our veri blood out of us we sat up
and gasp
phew said i grab at the halo of fli which buzz cheerfulli
round my head the heat did not affect them
my word said sir henri
it is hot echo good
it wa hot inde and there wa not a bit of shelter to be found
look where we would there wa no rock or tree noth but an unend
glare render dazzl by the heat air that danc over the surfac
of the desert as it danc over a redhot stove
what is to be done ask sir henri we cant stand thi for long
we look at each other blankli
i have it said good we must dig a hole get in it and cover
ourselv with the karoo bush
it did not seem a veri promis suggest but at least it wa better
than noth so we set to work and with the trowel we had brought
with us and the help of our hand in about an hour we succeed in
delv out a patch of ground some ten feet long by twelv wide to the
depth of two feet then we cut a quantiti of low scrub with our
huntingkn and creep into the hole pull it over us all with
the except of ventvgel on whom be a hottentot the heat had no
particular effect thi gave us some slight shelter from the burn
rai of the sun but the atmospher in that amateur grave can be better
imagin than describ the black hole of calcutta must have been a
fool to it inde to thi moment i do not know how we live through
the dai there we lai pant and everi now and again moisten our
lip from our scanti suppli of water had we follow our inclin
we should have finish all we possess in the first two hour but we
were forc to exercis the most rigid care for if our water fail us
we knew that veri soon we must perish miser
but everyth ha an end if onli you live long enough to see it and
somehow that miser dai wore on toward even about three oclock
in the afternoon we determin that we could bear it no longer it
would be better to die walk that to be kill slowli by heat and
thirst in thi dread hole so take each of us a littl drink from
our fast diminish suppli of water now warm to about the same
temperatur as a man blood we stagger forward
we had then cover some fifti mile of wilder if the reader will
refer to the rough copi and translat of old da silvestra map he
will see that the desert is mark as measur forti leagu across
and the pan bad water is set down as be about in the middl of it
now forti leagu is on hundr and twenti mile consequ we
ought at the most to be within twelv or fifteen mile of the water if
ani should realli exist
through the afternoon we crept slowli and painfulli along scarc
do more than a mile and a half in an hour at sunset we rest
again wait for the moon and after drink a littl manag to get
some sleep
befor we lai down umbopa point out to us a slight and indistinct
hillock on the flat surfac of the plain about eight mile awai at the
distanc it look like an anthil and as i wa drop off to sleep
i fell to wonder what it could be
with the moon we march again feel dreadfulli exhaust and
suffer tortur from thirst and prickli heat nobodi who ha not
felt it can know what we went through we walk no longer we
stagger now and again fall from exhaust and be oblig to
call a halt everi hour or so we had scarc energi left in us to
speak up to thi good had chat and joke for he is a merri fellow
but now he had not a joke in him
at last about two oclock utterli worn out in bodi and mind we came
to the foot of the queer hill or sand koppi which at first sight
resembl a gigant antheap about a hundr feet high and cover
at the base nearli two acr of ground
here we halt and driven to it by our desper thirst suck down
our last drop of water we had but half a pint a head and each of us
could have drunk a gallon
then we lai down just as i wa drop off to sleep i heard umbopa
remark to himself in zulu
if we cannot find water we shall all be dead befor the moon rise
tomorrow
i shudder hot as it wa the near prospect of such an aw death is
not pleasant but even the thought of it could not keep me from
sleep

chapter vi
water water
two hour later that is about four oclock i woke up for so soon as
the first heavi demand of bodili fatigu had been satisfi the
tortur thirst from which i wa suffer assert itself i could
sleep no more i had been dream that i wa bath in a run
stream with green bank and tree upon them and i awok to find
myself in thi arid wilder and to rememb as umbopa had said
that if we did not find water thi dai we must perish miser no
human creatur could live long without water in that heat i sat up and
rub my grimi face with my dry and horni hand as my lip and
eyelid were stuck togeth and it wa onli after some friction and
with an effort that i wa abl to open them it wa not far from dawn
but there wa none of the bright feel of dawn in the air which wa
thick with a hot murki that i cannot describ the other were
still sleep
present it began to grow light enough to read so i drew out a littl
pocket copi of the ingoldsbi legend which i had brought with me and
read the jackdaw of rheim when i got to where
a nice littl boi held a golden ewer
emboss and fill with water as pure
as ani that flow between rheim and namur
liter i smack my crack lip or rather tri to smack them
the mere thought of that pure water made me mad if the cardin had
been there with hi bell book and candl i would have whip in and
drunk hi water up ye even if he had fill it alreadi with the sud
of soap worthi of wash the hand of the pope and i knew that the
whole consecr curs of the cathol church should fall upon me for
so do i almost think that i must have been a littl lighthead
with thirst weari and the want of food for i fell to think how
astonish the cardin and hi nice littl boi and the jackdaw would
have look to see a burnt up brownei grizzlyhair littl
eleph hunter suddenli bound between them put hi dirti face into
the basin and swallow everi drop of the preciou water the idea
amus me so much that i laugh or rather cackl aloud which woke
the other and thei began to rub their dirti face and drag their
gummedup lip and eyelid apart
as soon as we were all well awak we began to discuss the situat
which wa seriou enough not a drop of water wa left we turn the
bottl upsid down and lick their top but it wa a failur thei
were dry as a bone good who had charg of the flask of brandi got it
out and look at it longingli but sir henri promptli took it awai
from him for to drink raw spirit would onli have been to precipit
the end
if we do not find water we shall die he said
if we can trust to the old dom map there should be some about i
said but nobodi seem to deriv much satisfact from thi remark
it wa so evid that no great faith could be put in the map now it
wa gradual grow light and as we sat stare blankli at each
other i observ the hottentot ventvgel rise and begin to walk about
with hi ey on the ground present he stop short and utter a
guttur exclam point to the earth
what is it we exclaim and rise simultan we went to where
he wa stand stare at the sand
well i said it is fresh springbok spoor what of it
springbuck do not go far from water he answer in dutch
no i answer i forgot and thank god for it
thi littl discoveri put new life into us for it is wonder when a
man is in a desper posit how he catch at the slightest hope
and feel almost happi on a dark night a singl star is better than
noth
meanwhil ventvgel wa lift hi snub nose and snif the hot air
for all the world like an old impala ram who scent danger present
he spoke again
i smell water he said
then we felt quit jubil for we knew what a wonder instinct
these wildbr men possess
just at that moment the sun came up glorious and reveal so grand a
sight to our astonish ey that for a moment or two we even forgot
our thirst
there not more than forti or fifti mile from us glitter like
silver in the earli rai of the morn sun soar sheba breast
and stretch awai for hundr of mile on either side of them ran
the great suliman berg now that sit here i attempt to describ
the extraordinari grandeur and beauti of that sight languag seem to
fail me i am impot even befor it memori straight befor us rose
two enorm mountain the like of which ar not i believ to be
seen in africa if inde there ar ani other such in the world
measur each of them at least fifteen thousand feet in height
stand not more than a dozen mile apart link togeth by a
precipit cliff of rock and tower in aw white solemn
straight into the sky these mountain place thu like the pillar of
a gigant gatewai ar shape after the fashion of a woman breast
and at time the mist and shadow beneath them take the form of a
recumb woman veil mysteri in sleep their base swell gentli
from the plain look at that distanc perfectli round and smooth
and upon the top of each is a vast hillock cover with snow exactli
correspond to the nippl on the femal breast the stretch of cliff
that connect them appear to be some thousand of feet in height and
perfectli precipit and on each flank of them so far as the ey can
reach extent similar line of cliff broken onli here and there by
flat tabletop mountain someth like the worldfam on at cape
town a format by the wai that is veri common in africa
to describ the comprehens grandeur of that view is beyond my
power there wa someth so inexpress solemn and overpow
about those huge volcanoesfor doubtless thei ar extinct
volcanoesthat it quit aw us for a while the morn light plai
upon the snow and the brown and swell mass beneath and then as
though to veil the majest sight from our curiou ey strang
vapour and cloud gather and increas around the mountain till
present we could onli trace their pure and gigant outlin show
ghostlik through the fleeci envelop inde as we afterward
discov usual thei were wrap in thi gauzelik mist which
doubtless account for our not have seen them more clearli befor
sheba breast had scarc vanish into cloudclad privaci befor
our thirstliter a burn questionreassert itself
it wa all veri well for ventvgel to sai that he smelt water but we
could see no sign of it look which wai we would so far as the ey
might reach there wa noth but arid swelter sand and karoo scrub
we walk round the hillock and gaze about anxious on the other
side but it wa the same stori not a drop of water could be found
there wa no indic of a pan a pool or a spring
you ar a fool i said angrili to ventvgel there is no water
but still he lift hi ugli snub nose snif
i smell it baa he answer it is somewher in the air
ye i said no doubt it is in the cloud and about two month
henc it will fall and wash our bone
sir henri stroke hi yellow beard thoughtfulli perhap it is on the
top of the hill he suggest
rot said good whoever heard of water be found at the top of a
hill
let us go and look i put in and hopelessli enough we scrambl up
the sandi side of the hillock umbopa lead present he stop as
though he wa petrifi
nanzia manzi that is here is water he cri with a loud voic
we rush up to him and there sure enough in a deep cut or
indent on the veri top of the sand koppi wa an undoubt pool
of water how it came to be in such a strang place we did not stop to
inquir nor did we hesit at it black and unpleas appear it
wa water or a good imit of it and that wa enough for us we
gave a bound and a rush and in anoth second we were all down on our
stomach suck up the uninvit fluid as though it were nectar fit
for the god heaven how we did drink then when we had done drink
we tore off our cloth and sat down in the pool absorb the
moistur through our parch skin you harri my boi who have onli
to turn on a coupl of tap to summon hot and cold from an unseen
vasti cistern can have littl idea of the luxuri of that muddi wallow
in brackish tepid water
after a while we rose from it refresh inde and fell to on our
biltong of which we had scarc been abl to touch a mouth for
twentyfour hour and at our fill then we smoke a pipe and lai
down by the side of that bless pool under the overhang shadow of
it bank and slept till noon
all that dai we rest there by the water thank our star that we
had been lucki enough to find it bad as it wa and not forget to
render a due share of gratitud to the shade of the longdepart da
silvestra who had set it posit down so accur on the tail of
hi shirt the wonder thing to us wa that the pan should have
last so long and the onli wai in which i can account for thi is on
the supposit that it is fed by some spring deep down in the sand
have fill both ourselv and our waterbottl as full as possibl
in far better spirit we start off again with the moon that night we
cover nearli fiveandtwenti mile but needless to sai found no
more water though we were lucki enough the follow dai to get a
littl shade behind some antheap when the sun rose and for awhil
clear awai the mysteri mist suliman berg with the two majest
breast now onli about twenti mile off seem to be tower right
abov us and look grander than ever at the approach of even we
march again and to cut a long stori short by daylight next morn
found ourselv upon the lowest slope of sheba left breast for
which we had been steadili steer by thi time our water wa
exhaust onc more and we were suffer sever from thirst nor
inde could we see ani chanc of reliev it till we reach the snow
line far far abov us after rest an hour or two driven to it by
our tortur thirst we went on toil painfulli in the burn heat
up the lava slope for we found that the huge base of the mountain wa
compos entir of lava bed belch from the bowel of the earth in
some far past ag
by eleven oclock we were utterli exhaust and gener speak
in a veri bad state inde the lava clinker over which we must drag
ourselv though smooth compar with some clinker i have heard of
such as that on the island of ascens for instanc wa yet rough
enough to make our feet veri sore and thi togeth with our other
miseri had pretti well finish us a few hundr yard abov us
were some larg lump of lava and toward these we steer with the
intent of ly down beneath their shade we reach them and to
our surpris so far as we had a capac for surpris left in us on a
littl plateau or ridg close by we saw that the clinker wa cover
with a dens green growth evid soil form of decompos lava had
rest there and in due cours had becom the receptacl of seed
deposit by bird but we did not take much further interest in the
green growth for on cannot live on grass like nebuchadnezzar that
requir a special dispens of provid and peculiar digest
organ
so we sat down under the rock and groan and for on i wish
heartili that we had never start on thi fool errand as we were
sit there i saw umbopa get up and hobbl toward the patch of
green and a few minut afterward to my great astonish i
perceiv that usual veri dignifi individu danc and shout
like a maniac and wave someth green off we all scrambl toward
him as fast as our weari limb would carri us hope that he had
found water
what is it umbopa son of a fool i shout in zulu
it is food and water macumazahn and again he wave the green thing
then i saw what he had found it wa a melon we had hit upon a patch
of wild melon thousand of them and dead ripe
melon i yell to good who wa next me and in anoth minut hi
fals teeth were fix in on of them
i think we at about six each befor we had done and poor fruit as
thei were i doubt if i ever thought anyth nicer
but melon ar not veri nutriti and when we had satisfi our
thirst with their pulpi substanc and put a stock to cool by the
simpl process of cut them in two and set them end on in the
hot sun to grow cold by evapor we began to feel exceedingli
hungri we had still some biltong left but our stomach turn from
biltong and besid we were oblig to be veri spare of it for we
could not sai when we should find more food just at thi moment a
lucki thing chanc look across the desert i saw a flock of about
ten larg bird fly straight toward us
skit baa skit shoot master shoot whisper the hottentot
throw himself on hi face an exampl which we all follow
then i saw that the bird were a flock of pauw or bustard and that
thei would pass within fifti yard of my head take on of the
repeat winchest i wait till thei were nearli over us and then
jump to my feet on see me the pauw bunch up togeth as i
expect that thei would and i fire two shot straight into the thick
of them and as luck would have it brought on down a fine fellow
that weigh about twenti pound in half an hour we had a fire made of
dry melon stalk and he wa toast over it and we made such a feed
as we had not tast for a week we at that pauw noth wa left
of him but hi legbon and hi beak and we felt not a littl the
better afterward
that night we went on again with the moon carri as mani melon as
we could with us as we ascend we found the air grew cooler and
cooler which wa a great relief to us and at dawn so far as we could
judg we were not more than about a dozen mile from the snow line
here we discov more melon and so had no longer ani anxieti about
water for we knew that we should soon get plenti of snow but the
ascent had now becom veri precipit and we made but slow progress
not more than a mile an hour also that night we at our last morsel of
biltong as yet with the except of the pauw we had seen no
live thing on the mountain nor had we come across a singl spring or
stream of water which struck us as veri odd consid the expans
of snow abov us which must we thought melt sometim but as we
afterward discov ow to a caus which it is quit beyond my
power to explain all the stream flow down upon the north side of
the mountain
now we began to grow veri anxiou about food we had escap death by
thirst but it seem probabl that it wa onli to die of hunger the
event of the next three miser dai ar best describ by copi
the entri made at the time in my notebook
21st maystart 11 am find the atmospher quit cold enough
to travel by dai and carri some watermelon with us struggl on
all dai but found no more melon have evid pass out of their
district saw no game of ani sort halt for the night at sundown
have had no food for mani hour suffer much dure the night from
cold
22ndstart at sunris again feel veri faint and weak onli
made about five mile all dai found some patch of snow of which we
at but noth els camp at night under the edg of a great
plateau cold bitter drank a littl brandi each and huddl ourselv
togeth each wrap up in hi blanket to keep ourselv aliv ar
now suffer frightfulli from starvat and weari thought that
ventvgel would have di dure the night
23rdstruggl forward onc more as soon as the sun wa well up and
had thaw our limb a littl we ar now in a dread plight and i
fear that unless we get food thi will be our last dai journei but
littl brandi left good sir henri and umbopa bear up wonderfulli
but ventvgel is in a veri bad wai like most hottentot he cannot
stand cold pang of hunger not so bad but have a sort of numb feel
about the stomach other sai the same we ar now on a level with the
precipit chain or wall of lava link the two breast and the
view is gloriou behind us the glow desert roll awai to the
horizon and befor us lie mile upon mile of smooth hard snow almost
level but swell gentli upward out of the centr of which the
nippl of the mountain that appear to be some mile in circumfer
rise about four thousand feet into the sky not a live thing is to
be seen god help us i fear that our time ha come
and now i will drop the journal partli becaus it is not veri
interest read also what follow requir tell rather more
fulli
all that dayth 23rd mayw struggl slowli up the inclin of snow
ly down from time to time to rest a strang gaunt crew we must have
look while laden as we were we drag our weari feet over the
dazzl plain glare round us with hungri ey not that there wa
much us in glare for we could see noth to eat we did not
accomplish more than seven mile that dai just befor sunset we found
ourselv exactli under the nippl of sheba left breast which
tower thousand of feet into the air a vast smooth hillock of frozen
snow weak as we were we could not but appreci the wonder scene
made even more splendid by the fly rai of light from the set
sun which here and there stain the snow bloodr and crown the
great dome abov us with a diadem of glori
i sai gasp good present we ought to be somewher near that
cave the old gentleman wrote about
ye said i if there is a cave
come quatermain groan sir henri dont talk like that i have
everi faith in the dom rememb the water we shall find the place
soon
if we dont find it befor dark we ar dead men that is all about
it wa my consolatori repli
for the next ten minut we trudg in silenc when suddenli umbopa
who wa march along besid me wrap in hi blanket and with a
leather belt strap so tightli round hi stomach to make hi hunger
small as he said that hi waist look like a girl caught me by
the arm
look he said point toward the spring slope of the nippl
i follow hi glanc and some two hundr yard from us perceiv
what appear to be a hole in the snow
it is the cave said umbopa
we made the best of our wai to the spot and found sure enough that the
hole wa the mouth of a cavern no doubt the same as that of which da
silvestra wrote we were not too soon for just as we reach shelter
the sun went down with startl rapid leav the world nearli
dark for in these latitud there is but littl twilight so we crept
into the cave which did not appear to be veri big and huddl
ourselv togeth for warmth swallow what remain of our
brandybar a mouth eachand tri to forget our miseri in
sleep but the cold wa too intens to allow us to do so for i am
convinc that at thi great altitud the thermomet cannot have
mark less than fourteen or fifteen degre below freez point what
such a temperatur meant to us enerv as we were by hardship want
of food and the great heat of the desert the reader mai imagin
better than i can describ suffic it to sai that it wa someth as
near death from exposur as i have ever felt there we sat hour after
hour through the still and bitter night feel the frost wander round
and nip us now in the finger now in the foot now in the face in vain
did we huddl up closer and closer there wa no warmth in our
miser starv carcas sometim on of us would drop into an
uneasi slumber for a few minut but we could not sleep much and
perhap thi wa fortun for if we had i doubt if we should have
ever woke again inde i believ that it wa onli by forc of will
that we kept ourselv aliv at all
not veri long befor dawn i heard the hottentot ventvgel whose teeth
had been chatter all night like castanet give a deep sigh then
hi teeth stop chatter i did not think anyth of it at the
time conclud that he had gone to sleep hi back wa rest
against mine and it seem to grow colder and colder till at last it
felt like ic
at length the air began to grow grei with light then golden arrow
sped across the snow and at last the gloriou sun peep abov the
lava wall and look in upon our halffrozen form also it look upon
ventvgel sit there amongst us stone dead no wonder hi back
felt cold poor fellow he had di when i heard him sigh and wa now
frozen almost stiff shock beyond measur we drag ourselv from
the corpsehow strang is that horror we mortal have of the
companionship of a dead bodyand left it sit there it arm
clasp about it knee
by thi time the sunlight wa pour it cold rai for here thei were
cold straight into the mouth of the cave suddenli i heard an
exclam of fear from someon and turn my head
and thi is what i saw sit at the end of the cavernit wa not
more than twenti feet longwa anoth form of which the head rest
on it chest and the long arm hung down i stare at it and saw that
thi too wa a dead man and what wa more a white man
the other saw also and the sight prove too much for our shatter
nerv on and all we scrambl out of the cave as fast as our
halffrozen limb would carri us
chapter vii
solomon road
outsid the cavern we halt feel rather foolish
i am go back said sir henri
why ask good
becaus it ha struck me thatwhat we sawmai be my brother
thi wa a new idea and we reenter the place to put it to the
proof after the bright light outsid our ey weak as thei were with
stare at the snow could not pierc the gloom of the cave for a
while present howev thei grew accustom to the semidark
and we advanc toward the dead man
sir henri knelt down and peer into hi face
thank god he said with a sigh of relief it is not my brother
then i drew near and look the bodi wa that of a tall man in middl
life with aquilin featur grizzl hair and a long black moustach
the skin wa perfectli yellow and stretch tightli over the bone
it cloth with the except of what seem to be the remain of a
woollen pair of hose had been remov leav the skeletonlik frame
nake round the neck of the corps which wa frozen perfectli stiff
hung a yellow ivori crucifix
who on earth can it be said i
cant you guess ask good
i shook my head
why the old dom jo da silvestra of coursewho els
imposs i gasp he di three hundr year ago
and what is there to prevent him from last for three thousand year
in thi atmospher i should like to know ask good if onli the
temperatur is suffici low flesh and blood will keep fresh as new
zealand mutton for ever and heaven know it is cold enough here the
sun never get in here no anim come here to tear or destroi no
doubt hi slave of whom he speak on the write took off hi cloth
and left him he could not have buri him alon look he went on
stoop down to pick up a queerlyshap bone scrape at the end into
a sharp point here is the cleft bone that silvestra us to draw
the map with
we gaze for a moment astonish forget our own miseri in thi
extraordinari and as it seem to us semimiracul sight
ay said sir henri and thi is where he got hi ink from and he
point to a small wound on the dom left arm did ever man see such
a thing befor
there wa no longer ani doubt about the matter which for my own part i
confess perfectli appal me there he sat the dead man whose
direct written some ten gener ago had led us to thi spot
here in my own hand wa the rude pen with which he had written them
and about hi neck hung the crucifix that hi dy lip had kiss
gaze at him my imagin could reconstruct the last scene of the
drama the travel dy of cold and starvat yet strive to
convei to the world the great secret which he had discoveredth
aw loneli of hi death of which the evid sat befor us it
even seem to me that i could trace in hi stronglymark featur a
like to those of my poor friend silvestr hi descend who had
di twenti year befor in my arm but perhap that wa fanci at ani
rate there he sat a sad memento of the fate that so often overtak
those who would penetr into the unknown and there doubtless he will
still sit crown with the dread majesti of death for centuri yet
unborn to startl the ey of wander like ourselv if ever ani
such should come again to invad hi loneli the thing overpow
us alreadi almost perish as we were with cold and hunger
let us go said sir henri in a low voic stai we will give him a
companion and lift up the dead bodi of the hottentot ventvgel he
place it near to that of the old dom then he stoop and with a jerk
broke the rotten string of the crucifix which hung round da silvestra
neck for hi finger were too cold to attempt to unfasten it i
believ that he ha it still i took the bone pen and it is befor me
as i writesometim i us it to sign my name
then leav these two the proud white man of a past ag and the poor
hottentot to keep their etern vigil in the midst of the etern
snow we crept out of the cave into the welcom sunshin and resum
our path wonder in our heart how mani hour it would be befor we
were even as thei ar
when we had walk about half a mile we came to the edg of the
plateau for the nippl of the mountain doe not rise out of it exact
centr though from the desert side it had seem to do so what lai
below us we could not see for the landscap wa wreath in billow of
morn fog present howev the higher layer of mist clear a
littl and reveal at the end of a long slope of snow a patch of
green grass some five hundr yard beneath us through which a stream
wa run nor wa thi all by the stream bask in the bright
sun stood and lai a group of from ten to fifteen larg antelopesat
that distanc we could not see of what speci
the sight fill us with an unreason joi if onli we could get it
there wa food in plenti but the question wa how to do so the beast
were fulli six hundr yard off a veri long shot and on not to be
depend on when our live hung on the result
rapidli we discuss the advis of try to stalk the game but
in the end dismiss it reluctantli to begin with the wind wa not
favour and further we must certainli be perceiv howev
care we were against the blind background of snow which we
should be oblig to travers
well we must have a try from where we ar said sir henri which
shall it be quatermain the repeat rifl or the express
here again wa a question the winchest repeatersof which we had
two umbopa carri poor ventvgel as well as hi ownwer sight
up to a thousand yard wherea the express were onli sight to
three hundr and fifti beyond which distanc shoot with them wa
more or less guesswork on the other hand if thei did hit the
express bullet be expand were much more like to bring the
game down it wa a knotti point but i made up my mind that we must
risk it and us the express
let each of us take the buck opposit to him aim well at the point of
the shoulder and high up said i and umbopa do you give the word
so that we mai all fire togeth
then came a paus each of us aim hi level best as inde a man is
like to do when he know that life itself depend upon the shot
fire said umbopa in zulu and at almost the same instant the three
rifl rang out loudli three cloud of smoke hung for a moment befor
us and a hundr echo went fly over the silent snow present
the smoke clear and revealedoh joya great buck ly on it
back and kick furious in it death agoni we gave a yell of
triumphw were savedw should not starv weak as we were we
rush down the interven slope of snow and in ten minut from the
time of shoot that anim heart and liver were ly befor us
but now a new difficulti aros we had no fuel and therefor could
make no fire to cook them we gaze at each other in dismai
starv men should not be fanci said good we must eat raw
meat
there wa no other wai out of the dilemma and our gnaw hunger made
the proposit less distast than it would otherwis have been so
we took the heart and liver and buri them for a few minut in a
patch of snow to cool them then we wash them in the icecold water
of the stream and lastli at them greedili it sound horribl enough
but honestli i never tast anyth so good as that raw meat in a
quarter of an hour we were chang men our life and vigour came back
to us our feebl puls grew strong again and the blood went cours
through our vein but mind of the result of overfeed on
starv stomach we were care not to eat too much stop whilst
we were still hungri
thank heaven said sir henri that brute ha save our live what
is it quatermain
i rose and went to look at the antelop for i wa not certain it wa
about the size of a donkei with larg curv horn i had never seen
on like it befor the speci wa new to me it wa brown in colour
with faint red stripe and grew a thick coat i afterward discov
that the nativ of that wonder countri call these buck inco
thei ar veri rare and onli found at a great altitud where no other
game will live thi anim wa fairli hit high up in the shoulder
though whose bullet brought it down we could not of cours discov
i believ that good mind of hi marvel shot at the giraff
secretli set it down to hi own prowess and we did not contradict him
we had been so busi satisfi our hunger that hitherto we had not
found time to look about us but now have set umbopa to cut off as
much of the best meat as we were like to be abl to carri we began
to inspect our surround the mist had clear awai for it wa
eight oclock and the sun had suck it up so we were abl to take in
all the countri befor us at a glanc i know not how to describ the
gloriou panorama which unfold itself to our gaze i have never seen
anyth like it befor nor shall i suppos again
behind and over us tower sheba snowi breast and below some five
thousand feet beneath where we stood lai leagu on leagu of the most
love champaign countri here were dens patch of lofti forest
there a great river wound it silveri wai to the left stretch a vast
expans of rich undul veld or grass land whereon we could just
make out countless herd of game or cattl at that distanc we could
not tell which thi expans appear to be ring in by a wall of
distant mountain to the right the countri wa more or less
mountain that is solitari hill stood up from it level with
stretch of cultiv land between amongst which we could see group
of domeshap hut the landscap lai befor us as a map wherein
river flash like silver snake and alplik peak crown with
wildli twist snow wreath rose in grandeur whilst over all wa the
glad sunlight and the breath of natur happi life
two curiou thing struck us as we gaze first that the countri
befor us must lie at least three thousand feet higher than the desert
we had cross and secondli that all the river flow from south to
north as we had pain reason to know there wa no water upon the
southern side of the vast rang on which we stood but on the northern
face were mani stream most of which appear to unit with the great
river we could see wind awai farther than our ey could follow
we sat down for a while and gaze in silenc at thi wonder view
present sir henri spoke
isnt there someth on the map about solomon great road he said
i nod for i wa still gaze out over the far countri
well look there it is and he point a littl to our right
good and i look accordingli and there wind awai toward the
plain wa what appear to be a wide turnpik road we had not seen it
at first becaus on reach the plain it turn behind some broken
countri we did not sai anyth at least not much we were begin
to lose the sens of wonder somehow it did not seem particularli
unnatur that we should find a sort of roman road in thi strang
land we accept the fact that wa all
well said good it must be quit near us if we cut off to the
right hadnt we better be make a start
thi wa sound advic and so soon as we had wash our face and hand
in the stream we act on it for a mile or more we made our wai over
boulder and across patch of snow till suddenli on reach the top
of the littl rise we found the road at our feet it wa a splendid
road cut out of the solid rock at least fifti feet wide and
appar well kept though the odd thing wa that it seem to begin
there we walk down and stood on it but on singl hundr pace
behind us in the direct of sheba breast it vanish the entir
surfac of the mountain be strewn with boulder interspers with
patch of snow
what do you make of thi quatermain ask sir henri
i shook my head i could make noth of the thing
i have it said good the road no doubt ran right over the rang and
across the desert on the other side but the sand there ha cover it
up and abov us it ha been obliter by some volcan erupt of
molten lava
thi seem a good suggest at ani rate we accept it and
proceed down the mountain it prove a veri differ busi
travel along down hill on that magnific pathwai with full
stomach from what it wa travel uphil over the snow quit starv
and almost frozen inde had it not been for melancholi recollect
of poor ventvgel sad fate and of that grim cave where he kept
compani with the old dom we should have felt posit cheer
notwithstand the sens of unknown danger befor us everi mile we
walk the atmospher grew softer and balmier and the countri befor
us shone with a yet more lumin beauti as for the road itself i
never saw such an engin work though sir henri said that the
great road over the st gothard in switzerland is veri similar no
difficulti had been too great for the old world engin who laid it
out at on place we came to a ravin three hundr feet broad and at
least a hundr feet deep thi vast gulf wa actual fill in with
huge block of dress stone have arch pierc through them at the
bottom for a waterwai over which the road went on sublim at
anoth place it wa cut in zigzag out of the side of a precipic five
hundr feet deep and in a third it tunnel through the base of an
interven ridg a space of thirti yard or more
here we notic that the side of the tunnel were cover with quaint
sculptur mostli of mail figur drive in chariot on which
wa exceedingli beauti repres a whole battl scene with a
convoi of captiv be march off in the distanc
well said sir henri after inspect thi ancient work of art it
is veri well to call thi solomon road but my humbl opinion is that
the egyptian had been here befor solomon peopl ever set a foot on
it if thi isnt egyptian or phoenician handiwork i must sai that it
is veri like it
by middai we had advanc suffici down the mountain to search the
region where wood wa to be met with first we came to scatter bush
which grew more and more frequent till at last we found the road
wind through a vast grove of silver tree similar to those which ar
to be seen on the slope of tabl mountain at cape town i had never
befor met with them in all my wander except at the cape and
their appear here astonish me greatli
ah said good survei these shiningleav tree with evid
enthusiasm here is lot of wood let us stop and cook some dinner i
have about digest that raw heart
nobodi object to thi so leav the road we made our wai to a
stream which wa babbl awai not far off and soon had a goodli fire
of dry bough blaze cut off some substanti hunk from the
flesh of the inco which we had brought with us we proceed to toast
them on the end of sharp stick as on see the kafir do and at
them with relish after fill ourselv we lit our pipe and gave
ourselv up to enjoy that compar with the hardship we had
recent undergon seem almost heavenli
the brook of which the bank were cloth with dens mass of a
gigant speci of maidenhair fern interspers with featheri tuft of
wild asparagu sung merrili at our side the soft air murmur through
the leav of the silver tree dove coo around and brightwing
bird flash like live gem from bough to bough it wa a paradis
the magic of the place combin with an overwhelm sens of danger
left behind and of the promis land reach at last seem to charm
us into silenc sir henri and umbopa sat convers in a mixtur of
broken english and kitchen zulu in a low voic but earnestli enough
and i lai with my ey half shut upon that fragrant bed of fern and
watch them
present i miss good and i look to see what had becom of him
soon i observ him sit by the bank of the stream in which he had
been bath he had noth on but hi flannel shirt and hi natur
habit of extrem neat have reassert themselv he wa
activ emploi in make a most elabor toilet he had wash hi
guttapercha collar had thoroughli shaken out hi trouser coat and
waistcoat and wa now fold them up neatli till he wa readi to put
them on shake hi head sadli as he scan the numer rent and
tear in them which natur had result from our fright journei
then he took hi boot scrub them with a hand of fern and
final rub them over with a piec of fat which he had carefulli
save from the inco meat till thei look compar speak
respect have inspect them judici through hi eyeglass
he put the boot on and began a fresh oper from a littl bag that
he carri he produc a pocketcomb in which wa fix a tini
lookingglass and in thi he survei himself appar he wa not
satisfi for he proceed to do hi hair with great care then came a
paus whilst he again contempl the effect still it wa not
satisfactori he felt hi chin on which the accumul scrub of a ten
dai beard wa flourish
sure thought i he is not go to try to shave but so it wa
take the piec of fat with which he had greas hi boot good
wash it thoroughli in the stream then dive again into the bag he
brought out a littl pocket razor with a guard to it such as ar
bought by peopl who ar afraid of cut themselv or by those
about to undertak a sea voyag then he rub hi face and chin
vigor with the fat and began evid it prove a pain
process for he groan veri much over it and i wa convuls with
inward laughter as i watch him struggl with that stubbl beard it
seem so veri odd that a man should take the troubl to shave himself
with a piec of fat in such a place and in our circumst at last
he succeed in get the hair off the right side of hi face and
chin when suddenli i who wa watch becam consciou of a flash of
light that pass just by hi head
good sprang up with a profan exclam if it had not been a safeti
razor he would certainli have cut hi throat and so did i without
the exclam and thi wa what i saw stand not more than twenti
pace from where i wa and ten from good were a group of men thei
were veri tall and coppercolour and some of them wore great plume
of black feather and short cloak of leopard skin thi wa all i
notic at the moment in front of them stood a youth of about
seventeen hi hand still rais and hi bodi bent forward in the
attitud of a grecian statu of a spearthrow evid the flash of
light had been caus by a weapon which he had hurl
as i look an old soldierlik man step forward out of the group
and catch the youth by the arm said someth to him then thei
advanc upon us
sir henri good and umbopa by thi time had seiz their rifl and
lift them threateningli the parti of nativ still came on it
struck me that thei could not know what rifl were or thei would not
have treat them with such contempt
put down your gun i hallo to the other see that our onli
chanc of safeti lai in concili thei obei and walk to the
front i address the elderli man who had check the youth
greet i said in zulu not know what languag to us to my
surpris i wa understood
greet answer the old man not inde in the same tongu but
in a dialect so close alli to it that neither umbopa nor myself had
ani difficulti in understand him inde as we afterward found
out the languag spoken by thi peopl is an oldfashion form of the
zulu tongu bear about the same relationship to it that the english
of chaucer doe to the english of the nineteenth centuri
whenc come you he went on who ar you and why ar the face of
three of you white and the face of the fourth as the face of our
mother son and he point to umbopa i look at umbopa as he said
it and it flash across me that he wa right the face of umbopa wa
like the face of the men befor me and so wa hi great form like
their form but i had not time to reflect on thi coincid
we ar stranger and come in peac i answer speak veri
slowli so that he might understand me and thi man is our servant
you lie he answer no stranger can cross the mountain where all
thing perish but what do your li matterif ye ar stranger then
ye must die for no stranger mai live in the land of the kukuana it
is the king law prepar then to die o stranger
i wa slightli stagger at thi more especi as i saw the hand of
some of the men steal down to their side where hung on each what
look to me like a larg and heavi knife
what doe that beggar sai ask good
he sai we ar go to be kill i answer grimli
oh lord groan good and as wa hi wai when perplex he put
hi hand to hi fals teeth drag the top set down and allow
them to fly back to hi jaw with a snap it wa a most fortun move
for next second the dignifi crowd of kukuana utter a simultan
yell of horror and bolt back some yard
what up said i

them out good take them out
he obei slip the set into the sleev of hi flannel shirt
in anoth second curios had overcom fear and the men advanc
slowli appar thei had now forgotten their amiabl intent of

how is it o stranger ask the old man solemnli that thi fat
man point to good who wa clad in noth but boot and a flannel
shirt and had onli half finish hi shave whose bodi is cloth
and whose leg ar bare who grow hair on on side of hi sickli face
and not on the other and who wear on shine and transpar
eyehow is it i ask that he ha teeth which move of themselv
come awai from the jaw and return of their own will
open your mouth i said to good who promptli curl up hi lip and
grin at the old gentleman like an angri dog reveal to hi
astonish gaze two thin red line of gum as utterli innoc of
ivori as a newborn eleph the audienc gasp
where ar hi teeth thei shout with our ey we saw them
turn hi head slowli and with a gestur of ineff contempt good
swept hi hand across hi mouth then he grin again and lo there
were two row of love teeth
now the young man who had flung the knife threw himself down on the
grass and gave vent to a prolong howl of terror and as for the old
gentleman hi knee knock togeth with fear
i see that ye ar spirit he said falteringli did ever man born of
woman have hair on on side of hi face and not on the other or a
round and transpar ey or teeth which move and melt awai and
grew again pardon us o my lord
here wa luck inde and needless to sai i jump at the chanc

byplai stai i will show you here thou dog and slave address
umbopa in a savag tone give me the magic tube that speak and i
tip a wink toward my express rifl
umbopa rose to the occas and with someth as nearli resembl a
grin as i have ever seen on hi dignifi face he hand me the gun
it is here o lord of lord he said with a deep obeis
now just befor i had ask for the rifl i had perceiv a littl

the old man smile that my lord cannot do he answer
i rais the rifl and cover the buck it wa a small anim and on
which a man might well be excus for miss but i knew that it would
not do to miss
i drew a deep breath and slowli press on the trigger the buck stood
still as a stone
bang thud the antelop sprang into the air and fell on the rock
dead as a door nail
a groan of simultan terror burst from the group befor us
if you want meat i remark coolli go fetch that buck
the old man made a sign and on of hi follow depart and
present return bear the klipspring i notic with
satisfact that i had hit it fairli behind the shoulder thei

chapter viii
we enter kukuanaland
all that afternoon we travel along the magnific roadwai which
trend steadili in a northwesterli direct infadoo and scragga
walk with us but their follow march about on hundr pace
ahead
infadoo i said at length who made thi road
it wa made my lord of old time none know how or when not even the
wise woman gagool who ha live for gener we ar not old enough
to rememb it make none can fashion such road now but the king
suffer no grass to grow upon it
and whose ar the write on the wall of the cave through which we
have pass on the road i ask refer to the egyptianlik
sculptur that we had seen
my lord the hand that made the road wrote the wonder write we
know not who wrote them
when did the kukuana peopl come into thi countri
my lord the race came down here like the breath of a storm ten
thousand thousand moon ago from the great land which lie there
beyond and he point to the north thei could travel no further
becaus of the high mountain which ring in the land so sai the old
voic of our father that have descend to us the children and so
sai gagool the wise woman the smeller out of witch and again he
point to the snowclad peak the countri too wa good so thei
settl here and grew strong and power and now our number ar like
the sea sand and when twala the king call up hi regiment their
plume cover the plain so far as the ey of man can reach
and if the land is wall in with mountain who is there for the
regiment to fight with
nai my lord the countri is open there toward the north and now and
again warrior sweep down upon us in cloud from a land we know not
and we slai them it is the third part of the life of a man sinc there
wa a war mani thousand di in it but we destroi those who came
to eat us up so sinc then there ha been no war
your warrior must grow weari of rest on their spear infadoo
my lord there wa on war just after we destroi the peopl that
came down upon us but it wa a civil war dog at dog
how wa that
my lord the king my halfbroth had a brother born at the same
birth and of the same woman it is not our custom my lord to suffer
twin to live the weaker must alwai die but the mother of the king
hid awai the feebler child which wa born the last for her heart
yearn over it and that child is twala the king i am hi younger
brother born of anoth wife
well
my lord kafa our father di when we came to manhood and my
brother imotu wa made king in hi place and for a space reign and
had a son by hi favourit wife when the babe wa three year old
just after the great war dure which no man could sow or reap a
famin came upon the land and the peopl murmur becaus of the
famin and look round like a starv lion for someth to rend
then it wa that gagool the wise and terribl woman who doe not die
made a proclam to the peopl sai the king imotu is no king
and at the time imotu wa sick with a wound and lai in hi kraal not
abl to move
then gagool went into a hut and led out twala my halfbroth and
twin brother to the king whom she had hidden among the cave and rock
sinc he wa born and strip the moocha waistcloth off hi
loin show the peopl of the kukuana the mark of the sacr snake
coil round hi middl wherewith the eldest son of the king is mark
at birth and cri out loud behold your king whom i have save for
you even to thi dai
now the peopl be mad with hunger and altogeth bereft of reason
and the knowledg of truth cri outth king the king but i
knew that it wa not so for imotu my brother wa the elder of the
twin and our law king then just as the tumult wa at it height
imotu the king though he wa veri sick crawl from hi hut hold
hi wife by the hand and follow by hi littl son ignosithat is
by interpret the lightn
what is thi nois he ask why cry ye the king the king
then twala hi twin brother born of the same woman and in the same
hour ran to him and take him by the hair stab him through the
heart with hi knife and the peopl be fickl and ever readi to
worship the rise sun clap their hand and cri twala is
king now we know that twala is king
and what becam of imotu wife and her son ignosi did twala kill
them too
nai my lord when she saw that her lord wa dead the queen seiz the
child with a cry and ran awai two dai afterward she came to a kraal
veri hungri and none would give her milk or food now that her lord
the king wa dead for all men hate the unfortun but at nightfal a
littl child a girl crept out and brought her corn to eat and she
bless the child and went on toward the mountain with her boi
befor the sun rose again and there she must have perish for none
have seen her sinc nor the child ignosi
then if thi child ignosi had live he would be the true king of the
kukuana peopl
that is so my lord the sacr snake is round hi middl if he live
he is king but ala he is long dead
see my lord and infadoo point to a vast collect of hut
surround by a fenc which wa in it turn encircl by a great
ditch that lai on the plain beneath us that is the kraal where the
wife of imotu wa last seen with the child ignosi it is there that we
shall sleep tonight if inde he ad doubtfulli my lord sleep
at all upon thi earth
when we ar among the kukuana my good friend infadoo we do as the
kukuana do i said majest and turn round quickli to address
good who wa tramp along sullenli behind hi mind fulli occupi
with unsatisfactori attempt to prevent hi flannel shirt from flap
in the even breez to my astonish i but into umbopa who wa
walk along immedi behind me and veri evid had been
listen with the greatest interest to my convers with infadoo
the express on hi face wa most curiou and gave me the idea of a
man who wa struggl with partial success to bring someth long ago
forgotten back into hi mind
all thi while we had been press on at a good rate toward the
undul plain beneath us the mountain we had cross now loom
high abov our head and sheba breast were veil modestli in
diaphan wreath of mist as we went the countri grew more and more
love the veget wa luxuri without be tropic the sun
wa bright and warm but not burn and a graciou breez blew softli
along the odor slope of the mountain inde thi new land wa
littl less than an earthli paradis in beauti in natur wealth and
in climat i have never seen it like the transvaal is a fine countri
but it is noth to kukuanaland
so soon as we start infadoo had despatch a runner to warn the
peopl of the kraal which by the wai wa in hi militari command of
our arriv thi man had depart at an extraordinari speed which
infadoo inform me he would keep up all the wai as run wa an
exercis much practis among hi peopl
the result of thi messag now becam appar when we arriv within
two mile of the kraal we could see that compani after compani of men
were issu from it gate and march toward us
sir henri laid hi hand upon my arm and remark that it look as
though we were go to meet with a warm recept someth in hi
tone attract infadoo attent
let not my lord be afraid he said hastili for in my breast there
dwell no guil thi regiment is on under my command and come out
by my order to greet you
i nod easili though i wa not quit easi in my mind
about half a mile from the gate of thi kraal is a long stretch of
rise ground slope gentli upward from the road and here the
compani form it wa a splendid sight to see them each compani
about three hundr strong charg swiftli up the rise with flash
spear and wave plume to take their appoint place by the time we
reach the slope twelv such compani or in all three thousand six
hundr men had pass out and taken up their posit along the road
present we came to the first compani and were abl to gaze in
astonish on the most magnific set of warrior that i have ever
seen thei were all men of matur ag mostli veteran of about forti
and not on of them wa under six feet in height whilst mani stood six
feet three or four thei wore upon their head heavi black plume of
sakaboola feather like those which adorn our guid about their
waist and beneath the right knee were bound circlet of white ox
tail while in their left hand thei carri round shield measur
about twenti inch across these shield ar veri curiou the
framework is made of an iron plate beaten out thin over which is
stretch milkwhit oxhid
the weapon that each man bore were simpl but most effect
consist of a short and veri heavi twoedg spear with a wooden
shaft the blade be about six inch across at the widest part
these spear ar not us for throw but like the zulu bangwan
or stab assegai ar for close quarter onli when the wound
inflict by them is terribl in addit to hi bangwan everi man
carri three larg and heavi knive each knife weigh about two
pound on knife wa fix in the oxtail girdl and the other two at
the back of the round shield these knive which ar call tolla
by the kukuana take the place of the throw assegai of the zulu
the kukuana warrior can cast them with great accuraci to a distanc of
fifti yard and it is their custom on charg to hurl a vollei of
them at the enemi as thei come to close quarter
each compani remain still as a collect of bronz statu till we
were opposit to it when at a signal given by it command offic
who distinguish by a leopard skin cloak stood some pace in front
everi spear wa rais into the air and from three hundr throat
sprang forth with a sudden roar the royal salut of koom then so
soon as we had pass the compani form up behind us and follow us
toward the kraal till at last the whole regiment of the greysso
call from their white shieldsth crack corp of the kukuana peopl
wa march in our rear with a tread that shook the ground
at length branch off from solomon great road we came to the wide
foss surround the kraal which is at least a mile round and fenc
with a strong palisad of pile form of the trunk of tree at the
gatewai thi foss is span by a primit drawbridg which wa let
down by the guard to allow us to pass in the kraal is exceedingli well
laid out through the centr run a wide pathwai intersect at right
angl by other pathwai so arrang as to cut the hut into squar
block each block be the quarter of a compani the hut ar
domeshap and built like those of the zulu of a framework of
wattl beautifulli thatch with grass but unlik the zulu hut
thei have doorwai through which men could walk also thei ar much
larger and surround by a verandah about six feet wide beautifulli
pave with powder lime trodden hard
all along each side of thi wide pathwai that pierc the kraal were
rang hundr of women brought out by curios to look at us these
women for a nativ race ar exceedingli handsom thei ar tall and
grace and their figur ar wonderfulli fine the hair though
short is rather curli than woolli the featur ar frequent
aquilin and the lip ar not unpleasantli thick as is the case among
most african race but what struck us most wa their exceedingli quiet
and dignifi air thei were as wellbr in their wai as the
habitu of a fashion drawingroom and in thi respect thei
differ from zulu women and their cousin the masai who inhabit the
district beyond zanzibar their curios had brought them out to see
us but thei allow no rude express of astonish or savag
critic to pass their lip as we trudg wearili in front of them
not even when old infadoo with a surreptiti motion of the hand
point out the crown wonder of poor good beauti white leg
did thei suffer the feel of intens admir which evid
master their mind to find express thei fix their dark ey
upon thi new and snowi loveli for as i think i have said good
skin is exceedingli white and that wa all but it wa quit enough
for good who is modest by natur
when we reach the centr of the kraal infadoo halt at the door of
a larg hut which wa surround at a distanc by a circl of smaller
on
enter son of the star he said in a magniloqu voic and
deign to rest awhil in our humbl habit a littl food shall be
brought to you so that ye mai have no need to draw your belt tight
from hunger some honei and some milk and an ox or two and a few
sheep not much my lord but still a littl food
it is good said i infadoo we ar weari with travel through
realm of air now let us rest
accordingli we enter the hut which we found ampli prepar for our
comfort couch of tan skin were spread for us to lie on and
water wa place for us to wash in
present we heard a shout outsid and step to the door saw a
line of damsel bear milk and roast meali and honei in a pot
behind these were some youth drive a fat young ox we receiv the
gift and then on of the young men drew the knife from hi girdl and
dexter cut the ox throat in ten minut it wa dead skin
and joint the best of the meat wa then cut off for us and the
rest in the name of our parti i present to the warrior round us
who took it and distribut the white lord gift
umbopa set to work with the assist of an extrem prepossess
young woman to boil our portion in a larg earthenwar pot over a fire
which wa built outsid the hut and when it wa nearli readi we sent a
messag to infadoo and ask him and scragga the king son to join
us
present thei came and sit down upon littl stool of which
there were sever about the hut for the kukuana do not in gener
squat upon their haunch like the zulu thei help us to get through
our dinner the old gentleman wa most affabl and polit but it
struck me that the young on regard us with doubt togeth with the
rest of the parti he had been overaw by our white appear and by
our magic properti but it seem to me that on discov that we
at drank and slept like other mortal hi aw wa begin to wear
off and to be replac by a sullen suspicionwhich made me feel
rather uncomfort
in the cours of our meal sir henri suggest to me that it might be
well to try to discov if our host knew anyth of hi brother
fate or if thei had ever seen or heard of him but on the whole i
thought that it would be wiser to sai noth of the matter at thi
time it wa difficult to explain a rel lost from the star
after supper we produc our pipe and lit them a proceed which
fill infadoo and scragga with astonish the kukuana were
evid unacquaint with the divin delight of tobaccosmok the
herb is grown among them extens but like the zulu thei us it
for snuff onli and quit fail to identifi it in it new form
present i ask infadoo when we were to proce on our journei and
wa delight to learn that prepar had been made for us to leav
on the follow morn messeng have alreadi depart to inform
twala the king of our come

when thei had given us thi inform our visitor bade us
goodnight and have arrang to watch turn and turn about three of
us flung ourselv down and slept the sweet sleep of the weari whilst
the fourth sat up on the lookout for possibl treacheri

our journei to loo it took two full dai travel along solomon
great road which pursu it even cours right into the heart of
kukuanaland suffic it to sai that as we went the countri seem to
grow richer and richer and the kraal with their wide surround

slope of sheba breast sixti or seventi mile awai three great
snowcap mountain place at the point of a triangl start out
of the level plain the conform of these mountain is unlik that

round
infadoo saw us look at them and volunt a remark

without the map
i dont know said sir henri gloomili but somehow i think that i
shall find him
slowli the sun sank then suddenli dark rush down on the land
like a tangibl thing there wa no breathingspac between the dai and
night no soft transform scene for in these latitud twilight
doe not exist the chang from dai to night is as quick and as
absolut as the chang from life to death the sun sank and the world
wa wreath in shadow but not for long for see in the west there is
a glow then come rai of silver light and at last the full and
gloriou moon light up the plain and shoot it gleam arrow far
and wide fill the earth with a faint refulg
we stood and watch the love sight whilst the star grew pale
befor thi chasten majesti and felt our heart lift up in the
presenc of a beauti that i cannot describ mine ha been a rough
life but there ar a few thing i am thank to have live for and
on of them is to have seen that moon shine over kukuanaland
present our medit were broken in upon by our polit friend
infadoo
if my lord ar rest we will journei on to loo where a hut is made
readi for my lord tonight the moon is now bright so that we shall
not fall by the wai
we assent and in an hour time were at the outskirt of the town
of which the extent map out as it wa by thousand of camp fire
appear absolut endless inde good who is alwai fond of a bad
joke christen it unlimit loo soon we came to a moat with a
drawbridg where we were met by the rattl of arm and the hoars
challeng of a sentri infadoo gave some password that i could not
catch which wa met with a salut and we pass on through the
central street of the great grass citi after nearli half an hour
tramp past endless line of hut infadoo halt at last by the gate
of a littl group of hut which surround a small courtyard of
powder limeston and inform us that these were to be our poor
quarter
we enter and found that a hut had been assign to each of us these
hut were superior to ani that we had yet seen and in each wa a most
comfort bed made of tan skin spread upon mattress of
aromat grass food too wa readi for us and so soon as we had wash
ourselv with water which stood readi in earthenwar jar some young
women of handsom appear brought us roast meat and meali cob
daintili serv on wooden platter and present them to us with deep
obeis
we at and drank and then the bed have been all move into on hut
by our request a precaut at which the amiabl young ladi smile
we flung ourselv down to sleep thoroughli weari with our long
journei
when we woke it wa to find the sun high in the heaven and the femal
attend who did not seem to be troubl by ani fals shame alreadi
stand insid the hut have been order to attend and help us to
make readi
make readi inde growl good when on ha onli a flannel shirt
and a pair of boot that doe not take long i wish you would ask them
for my trouser quatermain
i ask accordingli but wa inform that these sacr relic had
alreadi been taken to the king who would see us in the forenoon
somewhat to their astonish and disappoint have request the
young ladi to step outsid we proceed to make the best toilet of
which the circumst admit good even went the length of again
shave the right side of hi face the left on which now appear a
veri fair crop of whisker we impress upon him he must on no account
touch as for ourselv we were content with a good wash and comb
our hair sir henri yellow lock were now almost upon hi shoulder
and he look more like an ancient dane than ever while my grizzl
scrub wa fulli an inch long instead of half an inch which in a
gener wai i consid my maximum length
by the time that we had eaten our breakfast and smoke a pipe a
messag wa brought to us by no less a personag than infadoo himself
that twala the king wa readi to see us if we would be pleas to come
we remark in repli that we should prefer to wait till the sun wa a
littl higher we were yet weari with our journei c c it is
alwai well when deal with uncivilis peopl not to be in too
great a hurri thei ar apt to mistak polit for aw or servil
so although we were quit as anxiou to see twala as twala could be to
see us we sat down and wait for an hour emploi the interv in
prepar such present as our slender stock of good
permittednam the winchest rifl which had been us by poor
ventvgel and some bead the rifl and ammunit we determin to
present to hi royal high and the bead were for hi wive and
courtier we had alreadi given a few to infadoo and scragga and
found that thei were delight with them never have seen such thing
befor at length we declar that we were readi and guid by
infadoo start off to the audienc umbopa carri the rifl and
bead
after walk a few hundr yard we came to an enclosur someth
like that surround the hut which had been allot to us onli
fifti time as big for it could not have cover less than six or
seven acr of ground all round the outsid fenc stood a row of hut
which were the habit of the king wive exactli opposit the
gatewai on the further side of the open space wa a veri larg hut
built by itself in which hi majesti resid all the rest wa open
ground that is to sai it would have been open had it not been fill
by compani after compani of warrior who were muster there to the
number of seven or eight thousand these men stood still as statu as
we advanc through them and it would be imposs to give an
adequ idea of the grandeur of the spectacl which thei present
with their wave plume their glanc spear and ironback
oxhid shield
the space in front of the larg hut wa empti but befor it were
place sever stool on three of these at a sign from infadoo we
seat ourselv umbopa stand behind us as for infadoo he took
up a posit by the door of the hut so we wait for ten minut or
more in the midst of a dead silenc but consciou that we were the
object of the concentr gaze of some eight thousand pair of ey
it wa a somewhat try ordeal but we carri it off as best we
could at length the door of the hut open and a gigant figur
with a splendid tigerskin karross flung over it shoulder step
out follow by the boi scragga and what appear to us to be a
witheredup monkei wrap in a fur cloak the figur seat itself
upon a stool scragga took hi stand behind it and the witheredup
monkei crept on all four into the shade of the hut and squat down
still there wa silenc
then the gigant figur slip off the karross and stood up befor
us a truli alarm spectacl it wa that of an enorm man with the
most entir repuls counten we had ever beheld thi man lip
were as thick as a negro the nose wa flat he had but on gleam
black ey for the other wa repres by a hollow in the face and
hi whole express wa cruel and sensual to a degre from the larg
head rose a magnific plume of white ostrich feather hi bodi wa
clad in a shirt of shine chain armour whilst round the waist and
right knee were the usual garnish of white oxtail in hi right hand
wa a huge spear about the neck a thick torqu of gold and bound on
the forehead shone dulli a singl and enorm uncut diamond
still there wa silenc but not for long present the man whom we
rightli guess to be the king rais the great javelin in hi hand
instantli eight thousand spear were lift in answer and from eight
thousand throat rang out the royal salut of koom three time
thi wa repeat and each time the earth shook with the nois that
can onli be compar to the deepest note of thunder
be humbl o peopl pipe out a thin voic which seem to come from
the monkei in the shade it is the king
it is the king boom out the eight thousand throat in answer
be humbl o peopl it is the king
then there wa silenc againdead silenc present howev it wa
broken a soldier on our left drop hi shield which fell with a
clatter on to the limeston floor
twala turn hi on cold ey in the direct of the nois
come hither thou he said in a cold voic
a fine young man step out of the rank and stood befor him
it wa thy shield that fell thou awkward dog wilt thou make me a
reproach in the ey of these stranger from the star what hast thou

we saw the poor fellow turn pale under hi duski skin
it wa by chanc o calf of the black cow he murmur
then it is a chanc for which thou must pai thou hast made me
foolish prepar for death
i am the king ox wa the low answer
scragga roar the king let me see how thou canst us thy spear

as for us we were petrifi with horror
onc twice he wave the spear and then struck ah right hometh
spear stood out a foot behind the soldier back he flung up hi hand
and drop dead from the multitud about us rose someth like a
murmur it roll round and round and di awai the tragedi wa

thereupon a girl came forward from behind the hut bear a jar fill

sir henri meanwhil wa boil with rage at what had happen inde
it wa with difficulti that we could keep him still
sit down for heaven sake i whisper our live depend on it

twala sat silent until the trace of the tragedi had been remov then
he address us

tone which i scarc like rememb that the star ar far off and
ye ar here how if i make you as him whom thei bore awai
i laugh out loud though there wa littl laughter in my heart
o king i said be care walk warili over hot stone lest thou

open space and befor thy feet reach the gate thou shalt be dead or

on hear thi suggest scragga utter a sort of howl and bolt
into the hut
twala frown majest the suggest did not pleas him
let a young ox be driven in he said
two men at onc depart run swiftli

catch sight of the vast concours of peopl stop stupidli
turn round and bellow

against a man of earth and i hand him the rifl
the king took it veri gingerli and laid it down at hi feet as he did
so i observ the wizen monkeylik figur creep from the shadow
of the hut it crept on all four but when it reach the place where
the king sat it rose upon it feet and throw the furri cover
from it face reveal a most extraordinari and weird counten
appar it wa that of a woman of great ag so shrunken that in size
it seem no larger than the face of a yearold child although made up
of a number of deep and yellow wrinkl set in these wrinkl wa a
sunken slit that repres the mouth beneath which the chin curv
outward to a point there wa no nose to speak of inde the visag
might have been taken for that of a sundri corps had it not been
for a pair of larg black ey still full of fire and intellig
which gleam and plai under the snowwhit eyebrow and the
project parchmentcolour skull like jewel in a charnelhous as
for the head itself it wa perfectli bare and yellow in hue while
it wrinkl scalp move and contract like the hood of a cobra
the figur to which thi fear counten belong a counten so
fear inde that it caus a shiver of fear to pass through us as we
gaze on it stood still for a moment then suddenli it project a
skinni claw arm with nail nearli an inch long and lai it on the
shoulder of twala the king began to speak in a thin and pierc
voic
listen o king listen o warrior listen o mountain and plain and
river home of the kukuana race listen o ski and sun o rain and
storm and mist listen o men and women o youth and maiden and o ye
babe unborn listen all thing that live and must die listen all

blood is good the red blood is bright there is no smell like the
smell of newsh blood the lion shall lap it and roar the vultur

order that thei should be admit and present three men enter
each bear a shine shirt of chain armour and a magnific
battleax
the gift of my lord the king to the white men from the star said a
herald who came with them
we thank the king i answer withdraw
the men went and we examin the armour with great interest it wa
the most wonder chain work that either of us had ever seen a whole

king is well pleas or much afraid or he would not have sent these
garment of steel cloth yourselv in them tonight my lord
the remaind of that dai we spent quietli rest and talk over
the situat which wa suffici excit at last the sun went
down the thousand watch fire glow out and through the dark we
heard the tramp of mani feet and the clash of hundr of spear as
the regiment pass to their appoint place to be readi for the
great danc then the full moon shone out in splendour and as we stood
watch her rai infadoo arriv clad in hi war dress and
accompani by a guard of twenti men to escort us to the danc as he
recommend we had alreadi don the shirt of chain armour which the
king had sent us put them on under our ordinari cloth and

uncomfort these steel shirt which evid had been made for

myself but sir henri fit hi magnific frame like a glove then
strap our revolv round our waist and take in our hand the
battleax which the king had sent with the armour we start
on arriv at the great kraal where we had that morn been receiv
by the king we found that it wa close pack with some twenti
thousand men arrang round it in regiment these regiment were in
turn divid into compani and between each compani ran a littl path
to allow space for the witchfind to pass up and down anyth more
impos than the sight that wa present by thi vast and orderli
concours of arm men it is imposs to conceiv there thei stood
perfectli silent and the moon pour her light upon the forest of
their rais spear upon their majest form wave plume and the
harmoni shade of their variouscolour shield wherev we
look were line upon line of dim face surmount by rang upon rang
of shimmer spear

present at thi danc each year anoth third is muster outsid in
case there should be troubl when the kill begin ten thousand more
garrison the outpost round loo and the rest watch at the kraal in

thei ar veri silent said good and inde the intens still
among such a vast concours of live men wa almost overpow
what sai bougwan ask infadoo
i translat
those over whom the shadow of death is hover ar silent he
answer grimli

it seem i said to the other that we ar go to assist at a
gladiatori show arrang regardless of expens
sir henri shiver and good said he wish that we could get out of it
tell me i ask infadoo ar we in danger
i know not my lord i trust not but do not seem afraid if ye live
through the night all mai go well with you the soldier murmur against
the king
all thi while we had been advanc steadili toward the centr of the
open space in the midst of which were place some stool as we
proceed we perceiv anoth small parti come from the direct of
the royal hut
it is the king twala scragga hi son and gagool the old and see
with them ar those who slai said infadoo point to a littl
group of about a dozen gigant and savagelook men arm with
spear in on hand and heavi kerri in the other
the king seat himself upon the centr stool gagool crouch at hi
feet and the other stood behind him
greet white lord twala cri as we came up be seat wast
not preciou timeth night is all too short for the deed that must
be done ye come in a good hour and shall see a gloriou show look
round white lord look round and he roll hi on wick ey from
regiment to regiment can the star show you such a sight as thi see
how thei shake in their wicked all those who have evil in their
heart and fear the judgment of heaven abov
begin begin pipe gagool in her thin pierc voic the hyna
ar hungri thei howl for food begin begin
then for a moment there wa intens still made horribl by a
presag of what wa to come
the king lift hi spear and suddenli twenti thousand feet were
rais as though thei belong to on man and brought down with a
stamp upon the earth thi wa repeat three time caus the solid
ground to shake and trembl then from a far point of the circl a
solitari voic began a wail song of which the refrain ran someth
as follow
what is the lot of man born of woman
back came the answer roll out from everi throat in that vast
compani
death
gradual howev the song wa taken up by compani after compani
till the whole arm multitud were sing it and i could no longer
follow the word except in so far as thei appear to repres
variou phase of human passion fear and joi now it seem to be
a love song now a majest swell war chant and last of all a death
dirg end suddenli in on heartbreak wail that went echo and
roll awai in a volum of bloodcurdl sound
again silenc fell upon the place and again it wa broken by the king
lift hi hand instantli we heard a patter of feet and from out
of the mass of warrior strang and aw figur appear run
toward us as thei drew near we saw that these were women most of
them ag for their white hair ornament with small bladder taken
from fish stream out behind them their face were paint in
stripe of white and yellow down their back hung snakeskin and
round their waist rattl circlet of human bone while each held a
small fork wand in her shrivel hand in all there were ten of
them when thei arriv in front of us thei halt and on of them
point with her wand toward the crouch figur of gagool cri
out
mother old mother we ar here
good good good answer that ag iniqu ar your ey keen
isanusi witch doctress ye seer in dark place

mother we can
then go tarri not ye vultur see the slayerspoint to the
omin group of execution behindmak sharp their spear the
white men from afar ar hungri to see go
with a wild yell gagool horrid minist broke awai in everi
direct like fragment from a shell the dry bone round their
waist rattl as thei ran and head for variou point of the dens
human circl we could not watch them all so we fix our ey upon
the isanusi nearest to us when she came to within a few pace of the
warrior she halt and began to danc wildli turn round and round
with an almost incred rapid and shriek out sentenc such as
i smell him the evildo he is near he who poison hi mother
i hear the thought of him who thought evil of the king
quicker and quicker she danc till she lash herself into such a
frenzi of excit that the foam flew in speck from her gnash
jaw till her ey seem to start from her head and her flesh to
quiver visibl suddenli she stop dead and stiffen all over like
a pointer dog when he scent game and then with outstretch wand she
began to creep stealthili toward the soldier befor her it seem to
us that as she came their stoicism gave wai and that thei shrank from
her as for ourselv we follow her movement with a horribl
fascin present still creep and crouch like a dog the
isanusi wa befor them then she halt and point and again crept
on a pace or two
suddenli the end came with a shriek she sprang in and touch a tall
warrior with her fork wand instantli two of hi comrad those
stand immedi next to him seiz the doom man each by on
arm and advanc with him toward the king
he did not resist but we saw that he drag hi limb as though thei
were paralys and that hi finger from which the spear had fallen
were limp like those of a man newli dead
as he came two of the villain execution step forward to meet
him present thei met and the execution turn round look
toward the king as though for order
kill said the king
kill squeak gagool
kill reecho scragga with a hollow chuckl
almost befor the word were utter the horribl dead wa done on
man had driven hi spear into the victim heart and to make assur
doubl sure the other had dash out hi brain with a great club
on count twala the king just like a black madam defarg as
good said and the bodi wa drag a few pace awai and stretch out
hardli wa the thing done befor anoth poor wretch wa brought up
like an ox to the slaughter thi time we could see from the
leopardskin cloak which he wore that the man wa a person of rank
again the aw syllabl were spoken and the victim fell dead
two count the king
and so the deadli game went on till about a hundr bodi were
stretch in row behind us i have heard of the gladiatori show of
the csar and of the spanish bullfight but i take the liberti of
doubt if either of them could be half so horribl as thi kukuana
witchhunt gladiatori show and spanish bullfight at ani rate
contribut to the public amus which certainli wa not the case
here the most confirm sensationmong would fight shy of sensat
if he knew that it wa well on the card that he would in hi own
proper person be the subject of the next event
onc we rose and tri to remonstr but were sternli repress by
twala
let the law take it cours white men these dog ar magician and
evildo it is well that thei should die wa the onli answer
vouchsaf to us
about halfpast ten there wa a paus the witchfind gather
themselv togeth appar exhaust with their bloodi work and
we thought that the perform wa done with but it wa not so for
present to our surpris the ancient woman gagool rose from her
crouch posit and support herself with a stick stagger off
into the open space it wa an extraordinari sight to see thi
fright vulturehead old creatur bent nearli doubl with extrem
ag gather strength by degre until at last she rush about almost
as activ as her illomen pupil to and fro she ran chant to
herself till suddenli she made a dash at a tall man stand in front
of on of the regiment and touch him as she did thi a sort of
groan went up from the regiment which evid he command but two
of it offic seiz him all the same and brought him up for
execut we learn afterward that he wa a man of great wealth and
import be inde a cousin of the king
he wa slain and twala count on hundr and three then gagool
again sprang to and fro gradual draw nearer and nearer to
ourselv
hang me if i dont believ she is go to try her game on us
ejacul good in horror
nonsens said sir henri
as for myself when i saw that old fiend danc nearer and nearer my
heart posit sank into my boot i glanc behind us at the long
row of corps and shiver
nearer and nearer waltz gagool look for all the world like an
anim crook stick or comma her horrid ey gleam and glow
with a most unholi lustr
nearer she came and yet nearer everi creatur in that vast assemblag
watch her movement with intens anxieti at last she stood still
and point
which is it to be ask sir henri to himself
in a moment all doubt were at rest for the old hag had rush in and
touch umbopa alia ignosi on the shoulder
i smell him out she shriek kill him kill him he is full of
evil kill him the stranger befor blood flow from him slai him o

chapter xi
we give a sign
for a long whiletwo hour i should thinkw sat there in silenc
be too much overwhelm by the recollect of the horror we had
seen to talk at last just as we were think of turn infor the
night drew nigh to dawnw heard a sound of step then came the
challeng of a sentri post at the kraal gate which appar wa
answer though not in an audibl tone for the step still advanc
and in anoth second infadoo had enter the hut follow by some
halfdozen statelylook chief
my lord he said i have come accord to my word my lord and
ignosi right king of the kukuana i have brought with me these
men point to the row of chief who ar great men among us
have each on of them the command of three thousand soldier that
live but to do their bid under the king i have told them of
what i have seen and what my ear have heard now let them also behold
the sacr snake around thee and hear thy stori ignosi that thei mai
sai whether or no thei will make caus with thee against twala the
king
by wai of answer ignosi again strip off hi girdl and exhibit
the snake tattoo about him each chief in turn drew near and examin
the sign by the dim light of the lamp and without sai a word pass
on to the other side
then ignosi resum hi moocha and address them repeat the
histori he had detail in the morn
now ye have heard chief said infadoo when he had done what sai
ye will ye stand by thi man and help him to hi father throne or
will ye not the land cri out against twala and the blood of the
peopl flow like the water in spring ye have seen tonight two
other chief there were with whom i had it in my mind to speak and
where ar thei now the hyna howl over their corps soon shall ye
be as thei ar if ye strike not choos then my brother
the eldest of the six men a short thickset warrior with white hair
step forward a pace and answer
thy word ar true infadoo the land cri out my own brother is
among those who di tonight but thi is a great matter and the
thing is hard to believ how know we that if we lift our spear it mai
not be for a thief and a liar it is a great matter i sai of which
none can see the end for of thi be sure blood will flow in river
befor the deed is done mani will still cleav to the king for men
worship the sun that still shine bright in the heaven rather than
that which ha not risen these white men from the star their magic
is great and ignosi is under the cover of their wing if he be inde
the right king let them give us a sign and let the peopl have a
sign that all mai see so shall men cleav to us know of a truth
that the white man magic is with them
ye have the sign of the snake i answer
my lord it is not enough the snake mai have been place there sinc
the man childhood show us a sign and it will suffic but we will
not move without a sign
the other gave a decid assent and i turn in perplex to sir
henri and good and explain the situat
i think that i have it said good exultingli ask them to give us a
moment to think
i did so and the chief withdrew so soon as thei had gone good went
to the littl box where he kept hi medicin unlock it and took
out a notebook in the flyleav of which wa an almanack now look
here you fellow isnt tomorrow the 4th of june he said
we had kept a care note of the dai so were abl to answer that it
wa
veri good then here we have it4 june total eclips of the moon
commenc at 815 greenwich time visibl in teneriffesouth africa
c there a sign for you tell them we will darken the moon
tomorrow night
the idea wa a splendid on inde the onli weak spot about it wa a
fear lest good almanack might be incorrect if we made a fals
propheci on such a subject our prestig would be gone for ever and so
would ignosi chanc of the throne of the kukuana
suppos that the almanack is wrong suggest sir henri to good who
wa busili emploi in work out someth on a blank page of the
book
i see no reason to suppos anyth of the sort wa hi answer
eclips alwai come up to time at least that is my experi of
them and it especi state that thi on will be visibl in south
africa i have work out the reckon as well as i can without
know our exact posit and i make out that the eclips should
begin here about ten oclock tomorrow night and last till halfpast
twelv for an hour and a half or so there should be almost total
dark
well said sir henri i suppos we had better risk it
i acquiesc though doubtfulli for eclips ar queer cattl to deal
withit might be a cloudi night for instanc or our date might be
wrongand sent umbopa to summon the chief back present thei came
and i address them thu
great men of the kukuana and thou infadoo listen we love not to
show our power for to do so is to interfer with the cours of
natur and to plung the world into fear and confus but sinc thi
matter is a great on and as we ar anger against the king becaus
of the slaughter we have seen and becaus of the act of the isanusi
gagool who would have put our friend ignosi to death we have
determin to break a rule and to give such a sign as all men mai see
come hither and i led them to the door of the hut and point to the
red ball of the moon what see ye there
we see the sink moon answer the spokesman of the parti
it is so now tell me can ani mortal man put out that moon befor her
hour of set and bring the curtain of black night down upon the
land
the chief laugh a littl at the question no my lord that no man
can do the moon is stronger than man who look on her nor can she
vari in her cours
ye sai so yet i tell you that tomorrow night about two hour befor
midnight we will caus the moon to be eaten up for a space of an hour
and half an hour ye deep dark shall cover the earth and it
shall be for a sign that ignosi is inde king of the kukuana if we
do thi thing will ye be satisfi
yea my lord answer the old chief with a smile which wa

to reward her with death
twala laugh as he answer
it is our custom and the figur who sit in stone yonder and he

fail to put the fairest girl to death todai misfortun would fall
upon me and my hous thu run the propheci of my peopl if the king

and he fell and hi hous and i reign in hi stead it is finish
she must die then turn to the guardsbr her hither scragga

two of the men step forward and as thei advanc the girl for the
first time realis her impend fate scream aloud and turn to

the girl foulata wrung her hand in anguish and cri out aloud oh

between the prostrat girl and the advanc spear of scragga
king i said it shall not be we will not endur thi thing let

twala rose from hi seat in wrath and astonish and from the chief
and serri rank of maiden who had close in slowli upon us in
anticip of the tragedi came a murmur of amaz

i glanc up at the moon despairingli and now to my intens joi and
relief saw that weor rather the almanackhad made no mistak on the

someth about balbu build a wall in latin whilst good address
the queen of night in a volum of the most classic bad languag which
he could think of
slowli the penumbra the shadow of a shadow crept on over the bright
surfac and as it crept i heard deep gasp of fear rise from the
multitud around
look o king i cri look gagool look chief and peopl and

meanwhil the dark ring crept on while all that great assembl fix
their ey upon the sky and stare and stare in fascin silenc
strang and unholi shadow encroach upon the moonlight an omin

snatch the spear from hi hand and sent it straight through him
scragga drop dead
at the sight and driven mad with fear of the gather dark and
of the unholi shadow which as thei believ wa swallow the moon
the compani of girl broke up in wild confus and ran screech
for the gatewai nor did the panic stop there the king himself
follow by hi guard some of the chief and gagool who hobbl
awai after them with marvel alacr fled for the hut so that in
anoth minut we ourselv the wouldb victim foulata infadoo and
most of the chief who had interview us on the previou night were

notwithstand the gloom we made fair progress
for an hour or more we journei on till at length the eclips began
to pass and that edg of the moon which had disappear the first
becam again visibl suddenli as we watch there burst from it a
silver streak of light accompani by a wondrou ruddi glow which
hung upon the black of the sky like a celesti lamp and a wild
and love sight it wa in anoth five minut the star began to
fade and there wa suffici light to see our whereabout we then
discov that we were clear of the town of loo and approach a
larg flattop hill measur some two mile in circumfer thi
hill which is of a format common in south africa is not veri high
inde it greatest elev is scarc more than 200 feet but it

mysteri of human life and an overwhelm sorrow at it futil and
sad tonight these thousand slept their healthi sleep tomorrow
thei and mani other with them ourselv perhap among them would be
stiffen in the cold their wive would be widow their children
fatherless and their place know them no more for ever onli the old
moon would shine on seren the night wind would stir the grass
and the wide earth would take it rest even as it did on befor we
were and will do on after we have been forgotten
yet man di not whilst the world at onc hi mother and hi monument
remain hi name is lost inde but the breath he breath still
stir the pinetop on the mountain the sound of the word he spoke
yet echo on through space the thought hi brain gave birth to we
have inherit todai hi passion ar our caus of life the joi and
sorrow that he knew ar our familiar friendsth end from which he
fled aghast will sure overtak us also
truli the univers is full of ghost not sheet churchyard spectr
but the inextinguish element of individu life which have onc
been can never die though thei blend and chang and chang again
for ever
all sort of reflect of thi natur pass through my mindfor as
i grow older i regret to sai that a detest habit of think seem
to be get a hold of mewhil i stood and stare at those grim yet
fantast line of warrior sleep as their sai goe upon
their spear
curti i said i am in a condit of pitiabl fear
sir henri stroke hi yellow beard and laugh as he answer
i have heard you make that sort of remark befor quatermain
well i mean it now do you know i veri much doubt if on of us will
be aliv tomorrow night we shall be attack in overwhelm forc
and it is quit a chanc if we can hold thi place
well give a good account of some of them at ani rate look here
quatermain thi busi is nasti and on with which properli
speak we ought not to be mix up but we ar in for it so we must
make the best of our job speak person i had rather be kill
fight than ani other wai and now that there seem littl chanc of
our find my poor brother it make the idea easier to me but
fortun favour the brave and we mai succe anywai the battl will
be aw and have a reput to keep up we shall need to be in
the thick of the thing
he made thi last remark in a mourn voic but there wa a gleam in
hi ey which beli it melancholi i have an idea sir henri curti
actual like fight
after thi we went to sleep for a coupl of hour or so
just about dawn we were awaken by infadoo who came to sai that
great activ wa to be observ in loo and that parti of the
king skirmish were drive in our outpost
we rose and dress ourselv for the frai each put on hi chain
armour shirt for which garment at the present junctur we felt
exceedingli thank sir henri went the whole length about the matter
and dress himself like a nativ warrior when you ar in
kukuanaland do as the kukuana do he remark as he drew the
shine steel over hi broad breast which it fit like a glove nor
did he stop there at hi request infadoo had provid him with a
complet set of nativ war uniform round hi throat he fasten the
leopardskin cloak of a command offic on hi brow he bound the
plume of black ostrich feather worn onli by gener of high rank and
about hi middl a magnific moocha of white oxtail a pair of
sandal a leglet of goat hair a heavi battleax with a
rhinoceroshorn handl a round iron shield cover with white oxhid
and the regul number of tolla or throwingkn made up hi
equip to which howev he ad hi revolv the dress wa no
doubt a savag on but i am bound to sai that i seldom saw a finer
sight than sir henri curti present in thi guis it show off hi
magnific physiqu to the greatest advantag and when ignosi arriv
present arrai in a similar costum i thought to myself that i had
never befor seen two such splendid men
as for good and myself the armour did not suit us nearli so well to
begin with good insist upon keep on hi newfound trouser and a
stout short gentleman with an eyeglass and on half of hi face
shave arrai in a mail shirt carefulli tuck into a veri seedi
pair of corduroi look more remark than impos in my case the
chain shirt be too big for me i put it on over all my cloth
which caus it to bulg in a somewhat ungainli fashion i discard my
trouser howev retain onli my veldtschoon have determin to
go into battl with bare leg in order to be the lighter for run
in case it becam necessari to retir quickli the mail coat a spear
a shield that i did not know how to us a coupl of tolla a
revolv and a huge plume which i pin into the top of my shoot
hat in order to give a bloodthirsti finish to my appear complet
my modest equip in addit to all these articl of cours we
had our rifl but as ammunit wa scarc and as thei would be
useless in case of a charg we arrang that thei should be carri
behind us by bearer
when at length we had equip ourselv we swallow some food
hastili and then start out to see how thing were go on at on
point in the tableland of the mountain there wa a littl koppi of
brown stone which serv the doubl purpos of headquart and of a
con tower here we found infadoo surround by hi own regiment
the grei which wa undoubtedli the finest in the kukuana armi and
the same that we had first seen at the outli kraal thi regiment
now three thousand five hundr strong wa be held in reserv and
the men were ly down on the grass in compani and watch the
king forc creep out of loo in long antlik column there seem
to be no end to the length of these columnsthre in all and each of
them number as we judg at least eleven or twelv thousand men
as soon as thei were clear of the town the regiment form up then
on bodi march off to the right on to the left and the third came
on slowli toward us
ah said infadoo thei ar go to attack us on three side at
onc
thi seem rather seriou new for our posit on the top of the
mountain which measur a mile and a half in circumfer be an
extend on it wa import to us to concentr our compar
small defend forc as much as possibl but sinc it wa imposs
for us to dictat in what wai we should be assail we had to make the
best of it and accordingli sent order to the variou regiment to
prepar to receiv the separ onslaught
1 thi cruel custom is not confin to the kukuana but is by no
mean uncommon amongst african tribe on the occas of the outbreak
of war or ani other import public eventaq
chapter xiii
the attack
slowli and without the slightest appear of hast or excit
the three column crept on when within about five hundr yard of us
the main or centr column halt at the root of a tongu of open plain
which ran up into the hill to give time to the other divis to
circumv our posit which wa shape more or less in the form of a
horsesho with it two point face toward the town of loo the
object of thi manoeuvr wa that the threefold assault should be
deliv simultan
oh for a gatl groan good as he contempl the serri
phalanx beneath us i would clear that plain in twenti minut
we have not got on so it is no us yearn for it but suppos you
try a shot quatermain said sir henri see how near you can go to
that tall fellow who appear to be in command two to on you miss him
and an even sovereign to be honestli paid if ever we get out of thi
that you dont drop the bullet within five yard
thi piqu me so load the express with solid ball i wait till
my friend walk some ten yard out from hi forc in order to get a
better view of our posit accompani onli by an orderli then
ly down and rest the express on a rock i cover him the rifl
like all express wa onli sight to three hundr and fifti yard
so to allow for the drop in trajectori i took him halfwai down the
neck which ought i calcul to find him in the chest he stood
quit still and gave me everi opportun but whether it wa the
excit or the wind or the fact of the man be a long shot i
dont know but thi wa what happen get dead on as i thought
a fine sight i press and when the puff of smoke had clear awai
to my disgust i saw my man stand there unharm whilst hi
orderli who wa at least three pace to the left wa stretch upon
the ground appar dead turn swiftli the offic i had aim at
began to run toward hi men in evid alarm
bravo quatermain sang out good youv frighten him
thi made me veri angri for if possibl to avoid it i hate to miss
in public when a man is master of onli on art he like to keep up hi
reput in that art move quit out of myself at my failur i did
a rash thing rapidli cover the gener as he ran i let drive with
the second barrel instantli the poor man threw up hi arm and fell
forward on to hi face thi time i had made no mistak andi sai it
as a proof of how littl we think of other when our own safeti pride
or reput is in questioni wa brute enough to feel delight at
the sight
the regiment who had seen the feat cheer wildli at thi exhibit
of the white man magic which thei took as an omen of success while
the forc the gener had belong towhich inde as we ascertain
afterward he had commandedfel back in confus sir henri and
good now took up their rifl and began to fire the latter
industri brown the dens mass befor him with anoth
winchest repeat and i also had anoth shot or two with the
result so far as we could judg that we put some six or eight men
hor de combat befor thei were out of rang
just as we stop fire there came an omin roar from our far
right then a similar roar rose on our left the two other divis
were engag us
at the sound the mass of men befor us open out a littl and
advanc toward the hill and up the spit of bare grass land at a slow
trot sing a deepthroat song as thei ran we kept up a steadi
fire from our rifl as thei came ignosi join in occasion and
account for sever men but of cours we produc no more effect
upon that mighti rush of arm human than he who throw pebbl doe
on the break wave
on thei came with a shout and the clash of spear now thei were
drive in the picket we had place among the rock at the foot of the
hill after that the advanc wa a littl slower for though as yet we
had offer no seriou opposit the attack forc must climb up
hill and thei came slowli to save their breath our first line of
defenc wa about halfwai down the side of the slope our second fifti
yard further back while our third occupi the edg of the plateau
on thei storm shout their warcri twala twala chiel
chiel twala twala smite smite ignosi ignosi chiel
chiel answer our peopl thei were quit close now and the
tolla or throwingkn began to flash backward and forward
and now with an aw yell the battl close in
to and fro swai the mass of struggl warrior men fall fast as
leav in an autumn wind but befor long the superior weight of the
attack forc began to tell and our first line of defenc wa slowli
press back till it merg into the second here the struggl wa veri
fierc but again our peopl were driven back and up till at length
within twenti minut of the commenc of the fight our third line
came into action
but by thi time the assail were much exhaust and besid had
lost mani men kill and wound and to break through that third
impenetr hedg of spear prove beyond their power for a while
the seeth line of savag swung backward and forward in the
fierc ebb and flow of battl and the issu wa doubt sir henri
watch the desper struggl with a kindl ey and then without a
word he rush off follow by good and flung himself into the
hottest of the frai as for myself i stop where i wa
the soldier caught sight of hi tall form as he plung into battl
and there rose a cry of
nanzia incubu nanzia unkungunklovo here is the eleph
chiel chiel
from that moment the end wa no longer in doubt inch by inch fight
with splendid gallantri the attack forc wa press back down the
hillsid till at last it retreat upon it reserv in someth like
confus at that instant too a messeng arriv to sai that the
left attack had been repuls and i wa just begin to congratul
myself believ that the affair wa over for the present when to
our horror we perceiv our men who had been engag in the right
defenc be driven toward us across the plain follow by swarm of
the enemi who had evid succeed at thi point
ignosi who wa stand by me took in the situat at a glanc and
issu a rapid order instantli the reserv regiment around us the
grei extend itself
again ignosi gave a word of command which wa taken up and repeat by
the captain and in anoth second to my intens disgust i found
myself involv in a furiou onslaught upon the advanc foe get
as much as i could behind ignosi huge frame i made the best of a bad
job and toddl along to be kill as though i like it in a minut
or twow were plung through the fly group of our men who at
onc began to reform behind us and then i am sure i do not know what
happen all i can rememb is a dread roll nois of the meet
of shield and the sudden apparit of a huge ruffian whose ey
seem liter to be start out of hi head make straight at me
with a bloodi spear buti sai it with pridei roseor rather
sankto the occas it wa on befor which most peopl would have
collaps onc and for all see that if i stood where i wa i must
be kill as the horrid apparit came i flung myself down in front
of him so cleverli that be unabl to stop himself he took a header
right over my prostrat form befor he could rise again i had risen
and settl the matter from behind with my revolv
shortli after thi somebodi knock me down and i rememb no more of
that charg
when i came to i found myself back at the koppi with good bend
over me hold some water in a gourd
how do you feel old fellow he ask anxious
i got up and shook myself befor repli
pretti well thank you i answer
thank heaven when i saw them carri you in i felt quit sick i
thought you were done for
not thi time my boi i fanci i onli got a rap on the head which
knock me stupid how ha it end
thei ar repuls at everi point for a while the loss is dreadfulli
heavi we have quit two thousand kill and wound and thei must
have lost three look there a sight and he point to long line
of men advanc by four
in the centr of everi group of four and be born by it wa a kind
of hide trai of which a kukuana forc alwai carri a quantiti with
a loop for a handl at each corner on these traysand their number
seem endlesslai wound men who as thei arriv were hastili
examin by the medicin men of whom ten were attach to a regiment
if the wound wa not of a fatal charact the suffer wa taken awai
and attend to as carefulli as circumst would allow but if on
the other hand the injur man condit prove hopeless what
follow wa veri dread though doubtless it mai have been the
truest merci on of the doctor under pretenc of carri out an
examin swiftli open an arteri with a sharp knife and in a
minut or two the suffer expir painlessli there were mani case
that dai in which thi wa done in fact it wa done in the major
of case when the wound wa in the bodi for the gash made by the entri
of the enorm broad spear us by the kukuana gener render
recoveri imposs in most instanc the poor suffer were alreadi
unconsci and in other the fatal nick of the arteri wa inflict
so swiftli and painlessli that thei did not seem to notic it still it
wa a ghastli sight and on from which we were glad to escap inde
i never rememb anyth of the kind that affect me more than see
those gallant soldier thu put out of pain by the redhand medicin
men except inde on on occas when after an attack i saw a
forc of swazi buri their hopelessli wound aliv
hurri from thi dread scene to the further side of the koppi we
found sir henri who still held a battleax in hi hand ignosi
infadoo and on or two of the chief in deep consult
thank heaven here you ar quatermain i cant quit make out what
ignosi want to do it seem that though we have beaten off the attack
twala is now receiv larg reinforc and is show a
disposit to invest us with the view of starv us out
that awkward
ye especi as infadoo sai that the water suppli ha given out
my lord that is so said infadoo the spring cannot suppli the
want of so great a multitud and it is fail rapidli befor night
we shall all be thirsti listen macumazahn thou art wise and hast
doubtless seen mani war in the land from whenc thou camestthat is
if inde thei make war in the star now tell us what shall we do
twala ha brought up mani fresh men to take the place of those who have
fallen yet twala ha learnt hi lesson the hawk did not think to find
the heron readi but our beak ha pierc hi breast he fear to
strike at us again we too ar wound and he will wait for us to die
he will wind himself round us like a snake round a buck and fight the
fight of sit down
i hear thee i said
so macumazahn thou seest we have no water here and but a littl
food and we must choos between these three thingsto languish like a
starv lion in hi den or to strive to break awai toward the north
orand here he rose and point toward the dens mass of our
foesto launch ourselv straight at twala throat incubu the
great warriorfor todai he fought like a buffalo in a net and
twala soldier went down befor hi ax like young corn befor the
hail with these ey i saw itincubu sai charg but the eleph
is ever prone to charg now what sai macumazahn the wili old fox
who ha seen much and love to bite hi enemi from behind the last
word is in ignosi the king for it is a king right to speak of war
but let us hear thy voic o macumazahn who watchest by night and the
voic too of him of the transpar ey
what sayest thou ignosi i ask
nai my father answer our quondam servant who now clad as he wa
in the full panopli of savag war look everi inch a warrior king
do thou speak and let me who am but a child in wisdom besid thee
hearken to thy word
thu adjur after take hasti counsel with good and sir henri i
deliv my opinion briefli to the effect that be trap our
best chanc especi in view of the failur of our water suppli wa
to initi an attack upon twala forc then i recommend that the
attack should be deliv at onc befor our wound grew stiff and
also befor the sight of twala overpow forc caus the heart
of our soldier to wax small like fat befor a fire otherwis i
point out some of the captain might chang their mind and make
peac with twala desert to him or even betrai us into hi hand
thi express of opinion seem on the whole to be favour
receiv inde among the kukuana my utter met with a respect
which ha never been accord to them befor or sinc but the real
decis as to our plan lai with ignosi who sinc he had been
recognis as right king could exercis the almost unbound right
of sovereignti includ of cours the final decis on matter of
generalship and it wa to him that all ey were now turn
at length after a paus dure which he appear to be think
deepli he spoke
incubu macumazahn and bougwan brave white men and my friend
infadoo my uncl and chief my heart is fix i will strike at
twala thi dai and set my fortun on the blow ay and my lifemi
life and your live also listen thu will i strike ye see how the
hill curv round like the halfmoon and how the plain run like a
green tongu toward us within the curv
we see i answer
good it is now middai and the men eat and rest after the toil of
battl when the sun ha turn and travel a littl wai toward the
dark let thy regiment my uncl advanc with on other down to
the green tongu and it shall be that when twala see it he will hurl
hi forc at it to crush it but the spot is narrow and the regiment
can come against thee on at a time onli so mai thei be destroi on
by on and the ey of all twala armi shall be fix upon a struggl
the like of which ha not been seen by live man and with thee my
uncl shall go incubu my friend that when twala see hi battleax
flash in the first rank of the grei hi heart mai grow faint and i
will come with the second regiment that which follow thee so that if
ye ar destroi as it might happen there mai yet be a king left to
fight for and with me shall come macumazahn the wise
it is well o king said infadoo appar contempl the
certainti of the complet annihil of hi regiment with perfect
calm truli these kukuana ar a wonder peopl death ha no
terror for them when it is incur in the cours of duti
and whilst the ey of the multitud of twala soldier ar thu
fix upon the fight went on ignosi behold onethird of the men
who ar left aliv to us ie about 6000 shall creep along the right
horn of the hill and fall upon the left flank of twala forc and
onethird shall creep along the left horn and fall upon twala right
flank and when i see that the horn ar readi to toss twala then will
i with the men who remain to me charg home in twala face and if
fortun goe with us the dai will be our and befor night drive her
black oxen from the mountain to the mountain we shall sit in peac at
loo and now let us eat and make readi and infadoo do thou prepar
that the plan be carri out without fail and stai let my white
father bougwan go with the right horn that hi shine ey mai give
courag to the captain
the arrang for attack thu briefli indic were set in motion
with a rapid that spoke well for the perfect of the kukuana
militari system within littl more than an hour ration had been
serv out and devour the divis were form the scheme of
onslaught wa explain to the leader and the whole forc number
about 18000 men wa readi to move with the except of a guard left
in charg of the wound
present good came up to sir henri and myself
goodby you fellow he said i am off with the right wing
accord to order and so i have come to shake hand in case we
should not meet again you know he ad significantli
we shook hand in silenc and not without the exhibit of as much
emot as anglosaxon ar wont to show
it is a queer busi said sir henri hi deep voic shake a
littl and i confess i never expect to see tomorrow sun so far as
i can make out the grei with whom i am to go ar to fight until
thei ar wipe out in order to enabl the wing to slip round unawar
and outflank twala well so be it at ani rate it will be a man
death goodby old fellow god bless you i hope you will pull
through and live to collar the diamond but if you do take my advic
and dont have anyth more to do with pretend
in anoth second good had wrung us both by the hand and gone and then
infadoo came up and led off sir henri to hi place in the forefront of
the grei whilst with mani misgiv i depart with ignosi to my
station in the second attack regiment
chapter xiv
the last stand of the grei
in a few more minut the regiment destin to carri out the flank
movement had tramp off in silenc keep carefulli to the lee of
the rise ground in order to conceal their advanc from the keen ey
of twala scout
half an hour or more wa allow to elaps between the set out of
the horn or wing of the armi befor ani stir wa made by the grei
and their support regiment known as the buffalo which form it
chest and were destin to bear the brunt of the battl
both of these regiment were almost perfectli fresh and of full
strength the grei have been in reserv in the morn and have
lost but a small number of men in sweep back that part of the attack
which had prove success in break the line of defenc on the
occas when i charg with them and wa stun for my pain as for
the buffalo thei had form the third line of defenc on the left
and sinc the attack forc at that point had not succeed in
break through the second thei had scarc come into action at all
infadoo who wa a wari old gener and knew the absolut import
of keep up the spirit of hi men on the ev of such a desper
encount emploi the paus in address hi own regiment the
grei in poetic languag explain to them the honour that thei
were receiv in be put thu in the forefront of the battl and in
have the great white warrior from the star to fight with them in
their rank and promis larg reward of cattl and promot to all
who surviv in the event of ignosi arm be success
i look down the long line of wave black plume and stern face
beneath them and sigh to think that within on short hour most if
not all of those magnific veteran warrior not a man of whom wa
under forti year of ag would be laid dead or dy in the dust it
could not be otherwis thei were be condemn with that wise
reckless of human life which mark the great gener and often
save hi forc and attain hi end to certain slaughter in order
to give their caus and the remaind of the armi a chanc of success
thei were foredoom to die and thei knew the truth it wa to be
their task to engag regiment after regiment of twala armi on the
narrow strip of green beneath us till thei were extermin or till
the wing found a favour opportun for their onslaught and yet
thei never hesit nor could i detect a sign of fear upon the face
of a singl warrior there thei werego to certain death about to
quit the bless light of dai for ever and yet abl to contempl
their doom without a tremor even at that moment i could not help
contrast their state of mind with my own which wa far from
comfort and breath a sigh of envi and admir never befor
had i seen such an absolut devot to the idea of duti and such a
complet indiffer to it bitter fruit
behold your king end old infadoo point to ignosi go fight
and fall for him as is the duti of brave men and curs and shame
for ever be the name of him who shrink from death for hi king or who
turn hi back to the foe behold your king chief captain and
soldier now do your homag to the sacr snake and then follow on
that incubu and i mai show you a road to the heart of twala host
there wa a moment paus then suddenli a murmur aros from the
serri phalanx befor us a sound like the distant whisper of the
sea caus by the gentl tap of the handl of six thousand spear
against their holder shield slowli it swell till it grow
volum deepen and widen into a roar of roll nois that echo
like thunder against the mountain and fill the air with heavi wave
of sound then it decreas and by faint degre di awai into
noth and suddenli out crash the royal salut
ignosi i thought to myself might well be a proud man that dai for no
roman emperor ever had such a salut from gladiat about to die
ignosi acknowledg thi magnific act of homag by lift hi
battleax and then the grei file off in a triplelin format
each line contain about on thousand fight men exclus of
offic when the last compani had advanc some five hundr yard
ignosi put himself at the head of the buffalo which regiment wa
drawn up in a similar threefold format and gave the word to march
and off we went i needless to sai utter the most heartfelt
prayer that i might emerg from that entertain with a whole skin
mani a queer posit have i found myself in but never befor in on
quit so unpleas as the present or on in which my chanc of come
off safe wa smaller
by the time that we reach the edg of the plateau the grei were
alreadi halfwai down the slope end in the tongu of grass land that
ran up into the bend of the mountain someth as the frog of a
hors foot run up into the shoe the excit in twala camp on
the plain beyond wa veri great and regiment after regiment wa
start forward at a long swing trot in order to reach the root of
the tongu of land befor the attack forc could emerg into the
plain of loo
thi tongu which wa some four hundr yard in depth even at it
root or widest part wa not more than six hundr and fifti pace
across while at it tip it scarc measur nineti the grei who
in pass down the side of the hill and on to the tip of the tongu
had form into a column on reach the spot where it broaden out
again reassum their triplelin format and halt dead
then wethat is the buffaloesmov down the tip of the tongu and
took our stand in reserv about on hundr yard behind the last line
of the grei and on slightli higher ground meanwhil we had leisur
to observ twala entir forc which evid had been reinforc
sinc the morn attack and could not now notwithstand their
loss number less than forti thousand move swiftli up toward us
but as thei drew near the root of the tongu thei hesit have
discov that onli on regiment could advanc into the gorg at a
time and that there some seventi yard from the mouth of it
unassail except in front on account of the high wall of
boulderstrewn ground on each side stood the famou regiment of grei
the pride and glori of the kukuana armi readi to hold the wai against
their power as the three roman onc held the bridg against thousand
thei hesit and final stop their advanc there wa no
eager to cross spear with these three grim rank of warrior who
stood so firm and readi present howev a tall gener wear
the customari headdress of nod ostrich plume appear attend
by a group of chief and orderli be i thought none other than
twala himself he gave an order and the first regiment rais a
shout charg up toward the grei who remain perfectli still and
silent till the attack troop were within forti yard and a vollei
of tolla or throwingkn came rattl among their rank
then suddenli with a bound and a roar thei sprang forward with
uplift spear and the regiment met in deadli strife next second the
roll of the meet shield came to our ear like the sound of thunder
and the plain seem to be aliv with flash of light reflect from
the shimmer spear to and fro swung the surg mass of struggl
stab human but not for long suddenli the attack line began
to grow thinner and then with a slow long heav the grei pass over
them just as a great wave heav up it bulk and pass over a sunken
ridg it wa done that regiment wa complet destroi but the
grei had but two line left now a third of their number were dead
close up shoulder to shoulder onc more thei halt in silenc and
await attack and i wa rejoic to catch sight of sir henri yellow
beard as he move to and fro arrang the rank so he wa yet aliv
meanwhil we move on to the ground of the encount which wa
cumber by about four thousand prostrat human be dead dy
and wound and liter stain red with blood ignosi issu an
order which wa rapidli pass down the rank to the effect that none
of the enemi wound were to be kill and so far as we could see
thi command wa scrupul carri out it would have been a
shock sight if we had found time to think of such thing
but now a second regiment distinguish by white plume kilt and
shield wa move to the attack of the two thousand remain grei
who stood wait in the same omin silenc as befor till the foe
wa within forti yard or so when thei hurl themselv with
irresist forc upon them again there came the aw roll of the
meet shield and as we watch the tragedi repeat itself
but thi time the issu wa left longer in doubt inde it seem for
awhil almost imposs that the grei should again prevail the
attack regiment which wa form of young men fought with the
utmost furi and at first seem by sheer weight to be drive the
veteran back the slaughter wa truli aw hundr fall everi
minut and from among the shout of the warrior and the groan of the
dy set to the music of clash spear came a continu hiss
underton of sgee sgee the note of triumph of each victor as he
pass hi assegai through and through the bodi of hi fallen foe
but perfect disciplin and steadi and unchang valour can do wonder
and on veteran soldier is worth two young on as soon becam
appar in the present case for just when we thought that it wa all
over with the grei and were prepar to take their place so soon as
thei made room by be destroi i heard sir henri deep voic
ring out through the din and caught a glimps of hi circl
battleax as he wave it high abov hi plume then came a chang
the grei ceas to give thei stood still as a rock against which the
furiou wave of spearmen broke again and again onli to recoil
present thei began to move onc moreforward thi time as thei had
no firearm there wa no smoke so we could see it all anoth minut
and the onslaught grew fainter
ah these ar men inde thei will conquer again call out
ignosi who wa grind hi teeth with excit at my side see it
is done
suddenli like puff of smoke from the mouth of a cannon the attack
regiment broke awai in fly group their white headdress
stream behind them in the wind and left their oppon victor
inde but ala no more a regiment of the gallant tripl line
which forti minut befor had gone into action three thousand strong
there remain at most some six hundr bloodspatt men the rest
were under foot and yet thei cheer and wave their spear in
triumph and then instead of fall back upon us as we expect thei
ran forward for a hundr yard or so after the fly group of
foemen took possess of a rise knoll of ground and resum
their tripl format form a threefold ring around it base and
there thank be to heaven stand on the top of the mound for a
minut i saw sir henri appar unharm and with him our old
friend infadoo then twala regiment roll down upon the doom
band and onc more the battl close in
as those who read thi histori will probabl long ago have gather i
am to be honest a bit of a coward and certainli in no wai given to
fight though somehow it ha often been my lot to get into
unpleas posit and to be oblig to shed man blood but i have
alwai hate it and kept my own blood as undiminish in quantiti as
possibl sometim by a judici us of my heel at thi moment
howev for the first time in my life i felt my bosom burn with
martial ardour warlik fragment from the ingoldsbi legend
togeth with number of sanguinari vers in the old testament sprang
up in my brain like mushroom in the dark my blood which hitherto had
been halffrozen with horror went beat through my vein and there
came upon me a savag desir to kill and spare not i glanc round at
the serri rank of warrior behind us and somehow all in an
instant i began to wonder if my face look like their there thei
stood the hand twitch the lip apart the fierc featur
instinct with the hungri lust of battl and in the ey a look like
the glare of a bloodhound when after long pursuit he sight hi quarri
onli ignosi heart to judg from hi compar selfpossess
seem to all appear to beat as calmli as ever beneath hi
leopardskin cloak though even he still ground hi teeth i could
bear it no longer
ar we to stand here till we put out root umbopaignosi i
meanwhil twala swallow our brother yonder i ask
nai macumazahn wa the answer see now is the ripe moment let us
pluck it
as he spoke a fresh regiment rush past the ring upon the littl
mound and wheel round attack it from the hither side
then lift hi battleax ignosi gave the signal to advanc and
scream the wild kukuana warcri the buffalo charg home with a
rush like the rush of the sea
what follow immedi on thi it is out of my power to tell all i
can rememb is an irregular yet order advanc that seem to shake
the ground a sudden chang of front and form up on the part of the
regiment against which the charg wa direct then an aw shock a
dull roar of voic and a continu flash of spear seen through
a red mist of blood
when my mind clear i found myself stand insid the remnant of the
grei near the top of the mound and just behind no less a person than
sir henri himself how i got there i had at the moment no idea but sir
henri afterward told me that i wa born up by the first furiou
charg of the buffalo almost to hi feet and then left as thei in
turn were press back thereon he dash out of the circl and drag
me into shelter
as for the fight that follow who can describ it again and again
the multitud surg against our momentarili lessen circl and
again and again we beat them back
the stubborn spearmen still made good
the dark impenetr wood
each step where hi comrad stood
the instant that he fell
as someon or other beautifulli sai
it wa a splendid thing to see those brave battalion come on time
after time over the barrier of their dead sometim lift corps
befor them to receiv our spearthrust onli to leav their own
corps to swell the rise pile it wa a gallant sight to see that
old warrior infadoo as cool as though he were on parad shout
out order taunt and even jest to keep up the spirit of hi few
remain men and then as each charg roll on step forward to
wherev the fight wa thickest to bear hi share in it repuls
and yet more gallant wa the vision of sir henri whose ostrich plume
had been shorn off by a spear thrust so that hi long yellow hair
stream out in the breez behind him there he stood the great dane
for he wa noth els hi hand hi ax and hi armour all red
with blood and none could live befor hi stroke time after time i
saw it sweep down as some great warrior ventur to give him
battl and as he struck he shout ohoi ohoi like hi
berserkir forefath and the blow went crash through shield and
spear through headdress hair and skull till at last none would of
their own will come near the great white umtagati the wizard who
kill and fail not
but suddenli there rose a cry of twala y twala and out of the
press sprang forward none other than the gigant oneei king
himself also arm with battleax and shield and clad in chain
armour
where art thou incubu thou white man who slewest scragga my
sonse if thou canst slai me he shout and at the same time
hurl a tolla straight at sir henri who fortun saw it come
and caught it on hi shield which it transfix remain wedg in
the iron plate behind the hide
then with a cry twala sprang forward straight at him and with hi
battleax struck him such a blow upon the shield that the mere forc
and shock of it brought sir henri strong man as he is down upon hi
knee
but at thi time the matter went no further for that instant there
rose from the regiment press round us someth like a shout of
dismai and on look up i saw the caus
to the right and to the left the plain wa aliv with the plume of
charg warrior the outflank squadron had come to our relief
the time could not have been better chosen all twala armi as ignosi
predict would be the case had fix their attent on the bloodi
struggl which wa rage round the remnant of the grei and that of
the buffalo who were now carri on a battl of their own at a
littl distanc which two regiment had form the chest of our armi
it wa not until our horn were about to close upon them that thei had
dream of their approach for thei believ these forc to be hidden
in reserv upon the crest of the moonshap hill and now befor thei
could even assum a proper format for defenc the outflank
impi had leapt like greyhound on their flank
in five minut the fate of the battl wa decid taken on both
flank and dismai at the aw slaughter inflict upon them by the
grei and buffalo twala regiment broke into flight and soon the
whole plain between us and loo wa scatter with group of run
soldier make good their retreat as for the host that had so
recent surround us and the buffalo thei melt awai as though by
magic and present we were left stand there like a rock from which
the sea ha retreat but what a sight it wa around us the dead and
dy lai in heapedup mass and of the gallant grei there remain
but ninetyf men upon their feet more than three thousand four
hundr had fallen in thi on regiment most of them never to rise
again
men said infadoo calmli as between the interv of bind a
wound on hi arm he survei what remain to him of hi corp ye
have kept up the reput of your regiment and thi dai fight
will be well spoken of by your children children then he turn
round and shook sir henri curti by the hand thou art a great
captain incubu he said simpli i have live a long life among
warrior and have known mani a brave on yet have i never seen a man
like unto thee
at thi moment the buffalo began to march past our posit on the
road to loo and as thei went a messag wa brought to us from ignosi
request infadoo sir henri and myself to join them accordingli
order have been issu to the remain nineti men of the grei to
emploi themselv in collect the wound we join ignosi who
inform us that he wa press on to loo to complet the victori by
captur twala if that should be possibl befor we had gone far
suddenli we discov the figur of good sit on an antheap about
on hundr pace from us close besid him wa the bodi of a kukuana
he must be wound said sir henri anxious as he made the remark
an untoward thing happen the dead bodi of the kukuana soldier or
rather what had appear to be hi dead bodi suddenli sprang up
knock good head over heel off the antheap and began to spear him
we rush forward in terror and as we drew near we saw the brawni
warrior make dig after dig at the prostrat good who at each prod
jerk all hi limb into the air see us come the kukuana gave
on final and most viciou dig and with a shout of take that
wizard bolt awai good did not move and we conclud that our poor
comrad wa done for sadli we came toward him and were astonish to
find him pale and faint inde but with a seren smile upon hi face
and hi eyeglass still fix in hi ey
capit armour thi he murmur on catch sight of our face
bend over him how sold that beggar must have been and then he
faint on examin we discov that he had been serious
wound in the leg by a tolla in the cours of the pursuit but that
the chain armour had prevent hi last assail spear from do
anyth more than bruis him badli it wa a merci escap as
noth could be done for him at the moment he wa place on on of
the wicker shield us for the wound and carri along with us
on arriv befor the nearest gate of loo we found on of our
regiment watch it in obedi to order receiv from ignosi the
other regiment were in the same wai guard the differ exit to
the town the offic in command of thi regiment salut ignosi as
king and inform him that twala armi had taken refug in the town
whither twala himself had also escap but he thought that thei were
thoroughli demoralis and would surrend thereupon ignosi after
take counsel with us sent forward herald to each gate order the
defend to open and promis on hi royal word life and forgiv
to everi soldier who laid down hi arm but sai that if thei did
not do so befor nightfal he would certainli burn the town and all
within it gate thi messag wa not without it effect half an hour
later amid the shout and cheer of the buffalo the bridg wa
drop across the foss and the gate upon the further side were
flung open
take due precaut against treacheri we march on into the town
all along the roadwai stood thousand of deject warrior their
head droop and their shield and spear at their feet who head
by their offic salut ignosi as king as he pass on we march
straight to twala kraal when we reach the great space where a dai
or two previous we had seen the review and the witch hunt we found
it desert no not quit desert for there on the further side in
front of hi hut sat twala himself with but on attendantgagool
it wa a melancholi sight to see him seat hi battleax and shield
by hi side hi chin upon hi mail breast with but on old crone
for companion and notwithstand hi crime and misde a pang of
compass shot through me as i look upon twala thu fallen from hi
high estat not a soldier of all hi armi not a courtier out of
the hundr who had cring round him not even a solitari wife
remain to share hi fate or halv the bitter of hi fall poor
savag he wa learn the lesson which fate teach to most of us who
live long enough that the ey of mankind ar blind to the
discredit and that he who is defenceless and fallen find few
friend and littl merci nor inde in thi case did he deserv ani
file through the kraal gate we march across the open space to
where the exk sat when within about fifti yard of him the
regiment wa halt and accompani onli by a small guard we advanc
toward him gagool revil us bitterli as we came as we drew near
twala for the first time lift hi plume head and fix hi on
ey which seem to flash with suppress furi almost as brightli as
the great diamond bound round hi forehead upon hi success
rivalignosi
hail o king he said with bitter mockeri thou who hast eaten of
my bread and now by the aid of the white man magic hast seduc my
regiment and defeat mine armi hail what fate hast thou in store
for me o king

mani year wa the stern answer
it is good i will show thee how to die that thou mayest rememb it
against thine own time see the sun sink in blood and he point
with hi battleax toward the set orb it is well that my sun
should go down in it compani and now o king i am readi to die but
i crave the boon of the kukuana royal house1 to die fight thou
canst refus it or even those coward who fled todai will hold thee
shame
it is grant choosewith whom wilt thou fight myself i cannot
fight with thee for the king fight not except in war
twala sombr ey ran up and down our rank and i felt as for a
moment it rest on myself that the posit had develop a new
horror what if he chose to begin by fight me what chanc should
i have against a desper savag six feet five high and broad in
proport i might as well commit suicid at onc hastili i made up
my mind to declin the combat even if i were hoot out of kukuanaland
as a consequ it is i think better to be hoot than to be
quarter with a battleax
present twala spoke
incubu what sayest thou shall we end what we began todai or shall
i call thee coward whiteeven to the liver
nai interpos ignosi hastili thou shalt not fight with incubu
not if he is afraid said twala
unfortun sir henri understood thi remark and the blood flame up
into hi cheek
i will fight him he said he shall see if i am afraid
for heaven sake i entreat dont risk your life against that of
a desper man anybodi who saw you todai will know that you ar
brave enough
i will fight him wa the sullen answer no live man shall call me
a coward i am readi now and he step forward and lift hi ax
i wrung my hand over thi absurd piec of quixot but if he wa
determin on thi deed of cours i could not stop him
fight not my white brother said ignosi lai hi hand
affection on sir henri arm thou hast fought enough and if
aught befel thee at hi hand it would cut my heart in twain
i will fight ignosi wa sir henri answer
it is well incubu thou art a brave man it will be a good frai
behold twala the eleph is readi for thee
the exk laugh savag and step forward face curti for a
moment thei stood thu and the light of the sink sun caught their
stalwart frame and cloth them both in fire thei were a wellmatch
pair
then thei began to circl round each other their battleax rais
suddenli sir henri sprang forward and struck a fear blow at twala
who step to on side so heavi wa the stroke that the striker half
overbalanc himself a circumst of which hi antagonist took a
prompt advantag circl hi massiv battleax round hi head he
brought it down with tremend forc my heart jump into my mouth i
thought that the affair wa alreadi finish but no with a quick
upward movement of the left arm sir henri interpos hi shield between
himself and the ax with the result that it outer edg wa shorn
awai the ax fall on hi left shoulder but not heavili enough to
do ani seriou damag in anoth moment sir henri got in a second
blow which wa also receiv by twala upon hi shield
then follow blow upon blow that were in turn either receiv upon
the shield or avoid the excit grew intens the regiment which
wa watch the encount forgot it disciplin and draw near
shout and groan at everi stroke just at thi time too good who
had been laid upon the ground by me recov from hi faint and
sit up perceiv what wa go on in an instant he wa up and
catch hold of my arm hop about from place to place on on leg
drag me after him and yell encourag to sir henri
go it old fellow he halloo that wa a good on give it him
amidship and so on
present sir henri have caught a fresh stroke upon hi shield hit
out with all hi forc the blow cut through twala shield and through
the tough chain armour behind it gash him in the shoulder with a
yell of pain and furi twala return the blow with interest and such
wa hi strength shore right through the rhinocero horn handl of
hi antagonist battleax strengthen as it wa with band of steel
wound curti in the face
a cry of dismai rose from the buffalo as our hero broad axehead
fell to the ground and twala again rais hi weapon flew at him
with a shout i shut my ey when i open them again it wa to see
sir henri shield ly on the ground and sir henri himself with hi
great arm twine round twala middl to and fro thei swung hug
each other like bear strain with all their mighti muscl for dear
life and dearer honour with a suprem effort twala swung the
englishman clean off hi feet and down thei came togeth roll
over and over on the lime pave twala strike out at curti head
with the battleax and sir henri try to drive the tolla he had
drawn from hi belt through twala armour
it wa a mighti struggl and an aw thing to see
get hi ax yell good and perhap our champion heard him
at ani rate drop the tolla he snatch at the ax which wa
fasten to twala wrist by a strip of buffalo hide and still roll
over and over thei fought for it like wild cat draw their breath
in heavi gasp suddenli the hide string burst and then with a great
effort sir henri freed himself the weapon remain in hi hand
anoth second and he wa upon hi feet the red blood stream from
the wound in hi face and so wa twala draw the heavi tolla from
hi belt he reel straight at curti and struck him in the breast
the stab came home true and strong but whoever it wa who made that
chain armour he understood hi art for it withstood the steel again
twala struck out with a savag yell and again the sharp knife
rebound and sir henri went stagger back onc more twala came on
and as he came our great englishman gather himself togeth and
swing the big ax round hi head with both hand hit at him with
all hi forc
there wa a shriek of excit from a thousand throat and behold
twala head seem to spring from hi shoulder then it fell and came
roll and bound along the ground toward ignosi stop just as
hi feet for a second the corps stood upright then with a dull crash
it came to the earth and the gold torqu from it neck roll awai
across the pavement as it did so sir henri overpow by faint
and loss of blood fell heavili across the bodi of the dead king
in a second he wa lift up and eager hand were pour water on hi
face anoth minut and the grei ey open wide
he wa not dead
then i just as the sun sank step to where twala head lai in the
dust unloos the diamond from the dead brow and hand it to ignosi
take it i said law king of the kukuanask by birth and
victori
ignosi bound the diadem upon hi brow then advanc he place hi
foot upon the broad chest of hi headless foe and broke out into a
chant or rather a pan of triumph so beauti and yet so utterli
savag that i despair of be abl to give an adequ version of hi
word onc i heard a scholar with a fine voic read aloud from the
greek poet homer and i rememb that the sound of the roll line
seem to make my blood stand still ignosi chant utter as it wa
in a languag as beauti and sonor as the old greek produc
exactli the same effect on me although i wa exhaust with toil and
mani emot
now he began now our rebellion is swallow up in victori and our
evildo is justifi by strength

lightn of my spear i shook them to the ground with the thunder of
my shout

fat with their blood
where ar the mighti on who rose up in the morn

chapter xv
good fall sick
after the fight wa end sir henri and good were carri into twala
hut where i join them thei were both utterli exhaust by exert
and loss of blood and inde my own condit wa littl better i
am veri wiri and can stand more fatigu than most men probabl on
account of my light weight and long train but that night i wa
quit done up and as is alwai the case with me when exhaust that
old wound which the lion gave me began to pain also my head wa ach
violent from the blow i had receiv in the morn when i wa
knock senseless altogeth a more miser trio than we were that
even it would have been difficult to discov and our onli comfort
lai in the reflect that we were exceedingli fortun to be there to
feel miser instead of be stretch dead upon the plain as so
mani thousand of brave men were that night who had risen well and
strong in the morn
somehow with the assist of the beauti foulata who sinc we
had been the mean of save her life had constitut herself our
handmaiden and especi good we manag to get off the chain
shirt which had certainli save the live of two of us that dai as i
expect we found that the flesh underneath wa terribl contus for
though the steel link had kept the weapon from enter thei had not
prevent them from bruis both sir henri and good were a mass of
contus and i wa by no mean free as a remedi foulata brought us
some pound green leav with an aromat odour which when appli
as a plaster gave us consider relief
but though the bruis were pain thei did not give us such anxieti
as sir henri and good wound good had a hole right through the
fleshi part of hi beauti white leg from which he had lost a
great deal of blood and sir henri with other hurt had a deep cut
over the jaw inflict by twala battleax luckili good is a veri
decent surgeon and so soon as hi small box of medicin wa
forthcom have thoroughli cleans the wound he manag to
stitch up first sir henri and then hi own pretti satisfactorili
consid the imperfect light given by the primit kukuana lamp in
the hut afterward he plentifulli smear the injur place with some
antisept ointment of which there wa a pot in the littl box and we
cover them with the remain of a pockethandkerchief which we
possess
meanwhil foulata had prepar us some strong broth for we were too
weari to eat thi we swallow and then threw ourselv down on the
pile of magnific karross or fur rug which were scatter about
the dead king great hut by a veri strang instanc of the ironi of
fate it wa on twala own couch and wrap in twala own
particular karross that sir henri the man who had slain him slept
that night
i sai slept but after that dai work sleep wa inde difficult to
begin with in veri truth the air wa full
of farewel to the dy
and mourn for the dead
from everi direct came the sound of the wail of women whose
husband son and brother had perish in the battl no wonder that
thei wail for over twelv thousand men or nearli a fifth of the
kukuana armi had been destroi in that aw struggl it wa
heartrend to lie and listen to their cri for those who never
would return and it made me understand the full horror of the work
done that dai to further man ambit toward midnight howev the
ceaseless cry of the women grew less frequent till at length the
silenc wa onli broken at interv of a few minut by a long
pierc howl that came from a hut in our immedi rear which as i
afterward discov proceed from gagool keen over the dead
king twala
after that i got a littl fit sleep onli to wake from time to time
with a start think that i wa onc more an actor in the terribl
event of the last twentyfour hour now i seem to see that warrior
whom my hand had sent to hi last account charg at me on the
mountaintop now i wa onc more in that gloriou ring of grei which
made it immort stand against all twala regiment upon the littl
mound and now again i saw twala plume and gori head roll past my
feet with gnash teeth and glare ey
at last somehow or other the night pass awai but when dawn broke i
found that my companion had slept no better than myself good inde
wa in a high fever and veri soon afterward began to grow
lighthead and also to my alarm to spit blood the result no
doubt of some intern injuri inflict dure the desper effort
made by the kukuana warrior on the previou dai to forc hi big spear
through the chain armour sir henri howev seem pretti fresh
notwithstand hi wound on the face which made eat difficult and
laughter an imposs though he wa so sore and stiff that he
could scarc stir
about eight oclock we had a visit from infadoo who appear but
littl the worsetough old warrior that he wasfor hi exert in
the battl although he inform us that he had been up all night he
wa delight to see us but much griev at good condit and
shook our hand cordial i notic howev that he address sir
henri with a kind of rever as though he were someth more than
man and inde as we afterward found out the great englishman wa
look on throughout kukuanaland as a supernatur be no man the
soldier said could have fought as he fought or at the end of a dai
of such toil and bloodsh could have slain twala who in addit to
be the king wa suppos to be the strongest warrior in the
countri in singl combat shear through hi bullneck at a stroke
inde that stroke becam proverbi in kukuanaland and ani
extraordinari blow or feat of strength wa henceforth known as
incubu blow
infadoo told us also that all twala regiment had submit to
ignosi and that like submiss were begin to arriv from chief
in the outli countri twala death at the hand of sir henri had
put an end to all further chanc of disturb for scragga had been
hi onli legitim son so there wa no rival claimant to the throne
left aliv
i remark that ignosi had swum to power through blood the old chief
shrug hi shoulder ye he answer but the kukuana peopl can
onli be kept cool by let their blood flow sometim mani ar
kill inde but the women ar left and other must soon grow up to
take the place of the fallen after thi the land would be quiet for a
while
afterward in the cours of the morn we had a short visit from
ignosi on whose brow the royal diadem wa now bound as i
contempl him advanc with kingli digniti an obsequi guard
follow hi step i could not help recal to my mind the tall
zulu who had present himself to us at durban some few month back
ask to be taken into our servic and reflect on the strang
revolut of the wheel of fortun
hail o king i said rise
ye macumazahn king at last by the might of your three right
hand wa the readi answer
all wa he said go well and he hope to arrang a great feast in
two week time in order to show himself to the peopl
i ask him what he had settl to do with gagool
she is the evil geniu of the land he answer and i shall kill
her and all the witch doctor with her she ha live so long that
none can rememb when she wa not veri old and she it is who ha
alwai train the witchhunt and made the land wick in the sight
of the heaven abov
yet she know much i repli it is easier to destroi knowledg
ignosi than to gather it
that is so he said thoughtfulli she and she onli know the
secret of the three witch yonder whither the great road run
where the king ar buri and the silent on sit
ye and the diamond ar forget not thy promis ignosi thou must
lead us to the mine even if thou hast to spare gagool aliv to show
the wai
i will not forget macumazahn and i will think on what thou sayest
after ignosi visit i went to see good and found him quit deliri
the fever set up by hi wound seem to have taken a firm hold of hi
system and to be complic with an intern injuri for four or five
dai hi condit wa most critic inde i believ firmli that had
it not been for foulata indefatig nurs he must have di
women ar women all the world over whatev their colour yet somehow
it seem curiou to watch thi duski beauti bend night and dai over
the fever man couch and perform all the merci errand of a
sickroom swiftli gentli and with as fine an instinct as that of a
train hospit nurs for the first night or two i tri to help her
and so did sir henri as soon as hi stiff allow him to move but
foulata bore our interfer with impati and final insist
upon our leav him to her sai that our movement made him
restless which i think wa true dai and night she watch him and
tend him give him hi onli medicin a nativ cool drink made
of milk in which wa infus juic from the bulb of a speci of
tulip and keep the fli from settl on him i can see the whole
pictur now as it appear night after night by the light of our

it wa a few dai after thi last occurr that ignosi held hi great
indaba or council and wa formal recognis as king by the
induna or head men of kukuanaland the spectacl wa a most
impos on includ as it did a grand review of troop on thi dai
the remain fragment of the grei were formal parad and in the
face of the armi thank for their splendid conduct in the battl to
each man the king made a larg present of cattl promot them on
and all to the rank of offic in the new corp of grei which wa in
process of format an order wa also promulg throughout the
length and breadth of kukuanaland that whilst we honour the countri
by our presenc we three were to be greet with the royal salut and
to be treat with the same ceremoni and respect that wa by custom
accord to the king also the power of life and death wa publicli
confer upon us ignosi too in the presenc of hi peopl
reaffirm the promis which he had made to the effect that no man
blood should be shed without trial and that witchhunt should ceas
in the land
when the ceremoni wa over we wait upon ignosi and inform him that
we were now anxiou to investig the mysteri of the mine to which
solomon road ran ask him if he had discov anyth about them
my friend he answer i have discov thi it is there that
the three great figur sit who here ar call the silent on and
to whom twala would have offer the girl foulata as a sacrific it is
there too in a great cave deep in the mountain that the king of the
land ar buri there ye shall find twala bodi sit with those
who went befor him there also is a deep pit which at some time
longdead men dug out mayhap for the stone ye speak of such as i
have heard men in natal tell of at kimberlei there too in the place
of death is a secret chamber known to none but the king and gagool
but twala who knew it is dead and i know it not nor know i what is
in it yet there is a legend in the land that onc mani gener
gone a white man cross the mountain and wa led by a woman to the
secret chamber and shown the wealth hidden in it but befor he could
take it she betrai him and he wa driven by the king of that dai
back to the mountain and sinc then no man ha enter the place
the stori is sure true ignosi for on the mountain we found the
white man i said

in a few minut she came hurri along by two guard whom she wa

so soon as their support wa withdrawn the wither old bundlefor
she look more like a bundl than anyth els out of which her two
bright and wick ey gleam like those of a snakesank in a heap on

have a bit of meat to suck and i will show thee

chapter xvi
the place of death
it wa alreadi dark on the third dai after the scene describ in the
previou chapter when we camp in some hut at the foot of the three
witch as the triangl of mountain is call to which solomon
great road run our parti consist of our three selv and foulata
who wait on usespeci on goodinfadoo gagool who wa born
along in a litter insid which she could be heard mutter and
curs all dai long and a parti of guard and attend the
mountain or rather the three peak of the mountain for the mass wa
evid the result of a solitari upheav were as i have said in
the form of a triangl of which the base wa toward us on peak
be on our right on on our left and on straight in front of us
never shall i forget the sight afford by those three tower peak
in the earli sunlight of the follow morn high high abov us up
into the blue air soar their twist snowwreath beneath the
snowlin the peak were purpl with heath and so were the wild moor
that ran up the slope toward them straight befor us the white
ribbon of solomon great road stretch awai uphil to the foot of the
centr peak about five mile from us and there stop it wa it
terminu
i had better leav the feel of intens excit with which we set
out on our march that morn to the imagin of those who read thi
histori at last we were draw near to the wonder mine that had
been the caus of the miser death of the old portugues dom three
centuri ago of my poor friend hi illstar descend and also
as we fear of georg curti sir henri brother were we destin
after all that we had gone through to fare ani better evil befel
them as that old fiend gagool said would it also befal us somehow
as we were march up that last stretch of beauti road i could not
help feel a littl superstiti about the matter and so i think
did good and sir henri
for an hour and a half or more we tramp on up the heatherfring
wai go so fast in our excit that the bearer of gagool
hammock could scarc keep pace with us and it occup pipe out to
us to stop
walk more slowli white men she said project her hideou
shrivel counten between the grass curtain and fix her
gleam ey upon us why will ye run to meet the evil that shall
befal you ye seeker after treasur and she laugh that horribl
laugh which alwai sent a cold shiver down my back and for a while
quit took the enthusiasm out of us
howev on we went till we saw befor us and between ourselv and
the peak a vast circular hole with slope side three hundr feet
or more in depth and quit half a mile round
cant you guess what thi is i said to sir henri and good who were
stare in astonish at the aw pit befor us
thei shook their head
then it is clear that you have never seen the diamond dig at
kimberlei you mai depend on it that thi is solomon diamond mine
look there i said point to the strata of stiff blue clai which
were yet to be seen among the grass and bush that cloth the side
of the pit the format is the same ill be bound that if we went
down there we should find pipe of soapi brecciat rock look too
and i point to a seri of worn flat slab of stone that were place
on a gentl slope below the level of a watercours which in some past
ag had been cut out of the solid rock if those ar not tabl onc
us to wash the stuff im a dutchman
at the edg of thi vast hole which wa none other than the pit mark
on the old dom map the great road branch into two and circumv
it in mani place by the wai thi surround road wa built
entir out of block of stone appar with the object of
support the edg of the pit and prevent fall of reef along
thi path we press driven by curios to see what were the three
tower object which we could discern from the hither side of the
great gulf as we drew near we perceiv that thei were colossi of some
sort or anoth and rightli conjectur that befor us sat the three
silent on that ar held in such aw by the kukuana peopl but it
wa not until we were quit close to them that we recognis the full
majesti of these silent on
there upon huge pedest of dark rock sculptur with rude emblem
of the phallic worship separ from each other by a distanc of
forti pace and look down the road which cross some sixti mile
of plain to loo were three coloss seat formstwo male and on
femaleeach measur about thirti feet from the crown of it head to
the pedest
the femal form which wa nude wa of great though sever beauti but
unfortun the featur had been injur by centuri of exposur to
the weather rise from either side of her head were the point of a
crescent the two male colossi on the contrari were drape and
present a terrifi cast of featur especi the on to our
right which had the face of a devil that to our left wa seren in
counten but the calm upon it seem dread it wa the calm of
that inhuman cruelti sir henri remark which the ancient attribut
to be potent for good who could yet watch the suffer of
human if not without rejoic at least without sorrow these
three statu form a most aweinspir triniti as thei sit there in
their solitud and gaze out across the plain for ever
contempl these silent on as the kukuana call them an
intens curios again seiz us to know whose were the hand which
had shape them who it wa that had dug the pit and made the road
whilst i wa gaze and wonder suddenli it occur to mebe
familiar with the old testamentthat solomon went astrai after strang
god the name of three of whom i rememberedashtoreth the goddess
of the zidonian chemosh the god of the moabit and milcom the god
of the children of ammonand i suggest to my companion that the
figur befor us might repres these fals and explod divin
hum said sir henri who is a scholar have taken a high degre in
classic at colleg there mai be someth in that ashtoreth of the
hebrew wa the astart of the phoenician who were the great trader
of solomon time astart who afterward becam the aphrodit of the
greek wa repres with horn like the halfmoon and there on the
brow of the femal figur ar distinct horn perhap these colossi
were design by some phoenician offici who manag the mine who
can say1
befor we had finish examin these extraordinari relic of remot
antiqu infadoo came up and have salut the silent on by
lift hi spear ask us if we intend enter the place of
death at onc or if we would wait till after we had taken food at
middai if we were readi to go at onc gagool had announc her
willing to guid us as it wa not later than eleven
oclockdriven to it by a burn curiosityw announc our
intent of proceed instantli and i suggest that in case we
should be detain in the cave we should take some food with us
accordingli gagool litter wa brought up and that ladi herself
assist out of it meanwhil foulata at my request store some
biltong or dri gameflesh togeth with a coupl of gourd of
water in a reed basket with a hing cover straight in front of us
at a distanc of some fifti pace from the back of the colossi rose a
sheer wall of rock eighti feet or more in height that gradual
slope upward till it form the base of the lofti snowwreath peak
which soar into the air three thousand feet abov us as soon as she
wa clear of her hammock gagool cast on evil grin upon us and then
lean on a stick hobbl off toward the face of thi wall we
follow her till we came to a narrow portal solidli arch that look
like the open of a galleri of a mine
here gagool wa wait for us still with that evil grin upon her
horrid face
now white men from the star she pipe great warrior incubu
bougwan and macumazahn the wise ar ye readi behold i am here to do
the bid of my lord the king and to show you the store of bright
stone ha ha ha
we ar readi i said
good good make strong your heart to bear what ye shall see comest

infadoo frown as he answer
nai i come not it is not for me to enter there but thou gagool
curb thy tongu and bewar how thou dealest with my lord at thy

thou fifti time a witch thou shalt die hearest thou
i hear infadoo i know thee thou didst ever love big word when
thou wast a babe i rememb thou didst threaten thine own mother that
wa but the other dai but fear not fear not i live onli to do the
bid of the king i have done the bid of mani king infadoo
till in the end thei did mine ha ha i go to look upon their face
onc more and twala also come on come on here is the lamp and
she drew a larg gourd full of oil and fit with a rush wick from
under her fur cloak
art thou come foulata ask good in hi villain kitchen
kukuana in which he had been improv himself under that young ladi
tuition
i fear my lord the girl answer timidli
then give me the basket
nai my lord whither thou goest there i go also
the deuc you will thought i to myself that mai be rather awkward
if we ever get out of thi
without further ado gagool plung into the passag which wa wide
enough to admit of two walk abreast and quit dark we follow the
sound of her voic as she pipe to us to come on in some fear and
trembl which wa not allai by the flutter of a sudden rush of
wing
hullo what that hallo good somebodi hit me in the face
bat said i on you go
when so far as we could judg we had gone some fifti pace we
perceiv that the passag wa grow faintli light anoth minut
and we were in perhap the most wonder place that the ey of live
man have beheld
let the reader pictur to himself the hall of the vastest cathedr he
ever stood in windowless inde but dimli light from abov
presum by shaft connect with the outer air and driven in the
roof which arch awai a hundr feet abov our head and he will get
some idea of the size of the enorm cave in which we found ourselv
with the differ that thi cathedr design by natur wa loftier
and wider than ani built by man but it stupend size wa the least
of the wonder of the place for run in row adown it length were
gigant pillar of what look like ic but were in realiti huge
stalactit it is imposs for me to convei ani idea of the
overpow beauti and grandeur of these pillar of white spar some
of which were not less than twenti feet in diamet at the base and
sprang up in lofti and yet delic beauti sheer to the distant roof
other again were in process of format on the rock floor there wa
in these case what look sir henri said exactli like a broken
column in an old grecian templ whilst high abov depend from the
roof the point of a huge icicl could be dimli seen
even as we gaze we could hear the process go on for present with
a tini splash a drop of water would fall from the faroff icicl on to
the column below on some column the drop onli fell onc in two or
three minut and in these case it would be an interest
calcul to discov how long at that rate of drip it would
take to form a pillar sai eighti feet by ten in diamet that the
process in at least on instanc wa incalcul slow the follow
exampl will suffic to show cut on on of these pillar we discov
the crude like of a mummi by the head of which sat what appear
to be the figur of an egyptian god doubtless the handiwork of some
oldworld labour in the mine thi work of art wa execut at the
natur height at which an idl fellow be he phoenician workman or
british cad is in the habit of try to immortalis himself at the
expens of natur masterpiec name about five feet from the
ground yet at the time that we saw it which must have been nearli
three thousand year after the date of the execut of the carv
the column wa onli eight feet high and wa still in process of
format which give a rate of growth of a foot to a thousand year
or an inch and a fraction to a centuri thi we knew becaus as we
were stand by it we heard a drop of water fall
sometim the stalagmit took strang form presum where the
drop of the water had not alwai been on the same spot thu on
huge mass which must have weigh a hundr ton or so wa in the
shape of a pulpit beautifulli fret over outsid with a design that
look like lace other resembl strang beast and on the side of
the cave were fanlik ivori trace such as the frost leav upon a
pane
out of the vast main aisl there open here and there smaller cave
exactli sir henri said as chapel open out of great cathedr some
were larg but on or twoand thi is a wonder instanc of how
natur carri out her handiwork by the same unvari law utterli
irrespect of sizewer tini on littl nook for instanc wa no
larger than an unusu big doll hous and yet it might have been a
model for the whole place for the water drop tini icicl hung
and spar column were form in just the same wai
we had not howev enough time to examin thi beauti cavern so
thoroughli as we should have like to do sinc unfortun gagool
seem to be indiffer as to stalactit and onli anxiou to get her
busi over thi annoi me the more as i wa particularli anxiou
to discov if possibl by what system the light wa admit into
the cave and whether it wa by the hand of man or by that of natur
that thi wa done also if the place had been us in ani wai in
ancient time as seem probabl howev we consol ourselv with
the idea that we would investig it thoroughli on our wai back and
follow on at the heel of our uncanni guid
on she led us straight to the top of the vast and silent cave where
we found anoth doorwai not arch as the first wa but squar at
the top someth like the doorwai of egyptian templ
ar ye prepar to enter the place of death white men ask gagool
evid with a view to make us feel uncomfort
lead on macduff said good solemnli try to look as though he wa
not at all alarm as inde we all did except foulata who caught
good by the arm for protect
thi is get rather ghastli said sir henri peep into the dark
passagewai come on quatermainsenior prior we mustnt keep
the old ladi wait and he polit made wai for me to lead the van
for which inwardli i did not bless him
tap tap went old gagool stick down the passag as she trot
along chuckl hideous and still overcom by some unaccount
presenti of evil i hung back
come get on old fellow said good or we shall lose our fair
guid
thu adjur i start down the passag and after about twenti pace
found myself in a gloomi apart some forti feet long by thirti
broad and thirti high which in some past ag evid had been
hollow by handlabour out of the mountain thi apart wa not
nearli so well light as the vast stalactit antecav and at the
first glanc all i could discern wa a massiv stone tabl run down
it length with a coloss white figur at it head and lifes
white figur all round it next i discov a brown thing seat on
the tabl in the centr and in anoth moment my ey grew accustom
to the light and i saw what all these thing were and wa tail out
of the place as hard as my leg could carri me
i am not a nervou man in a gener wai and veri littl troubl with
superstit of which i have live to see the folli but i am free to
own that thi sight quit upset me and had it not been that sir henri
caught me by the collar and held me i do honestli believ that in
anoth five minut i should have been outsid the stalactit cave
and that a promis of all the diamond in kimberlei would not have
induc me to enter it again but he held me tight so i stop
becaus i could not help myself next second howev hi ey
becam accustom to the light and he let go of me and began to mop
the perspir off hi forehead as for good he swore feebli while
foulata threw her arm round hi neck and shriek
onli gagool chuckl loud and long
it wa a ghastli sight there at the end of the long stone tabl
hold in hi skeleton finger a great white spear sat death
himself shape in the form of a coloss human skeleton fifteen feet
or more in height high abov hi head he held the spear as though in
the act to strike on boni hand rest on the stone tabl befor him
in the posit a man assum on rise from hi seat whilst hi frame
wa bent forward so that the vertebr of the neck and the grin
gleam skull project toward us and fix it hollow eyeplac
upon us the jaw a littl open as though it were about to speak
great heaven said i faintli at last what can it be
and what ar those thing ask good point to the white
compani round the tabl
and what on earth is that thing said sir henri point to the
brown creatur seat on the tabl
hee hee hee laugh gagool to those who enter the hall of the
dead evil come hee hee hee ha ha
come incubu brave in battl come and see him thou slewest and the
old creatur caught curti coat in her skinni finger and led him
awai toward the tabl we follow
present she stop and point at the brown object seat on the
tabl sir henri look and start back with an exclam and no
wonder for there quit nake the head which curti battleax had
shorn from the bodi rest on it knee wa the gaunt corps of
twala the last king of the kukuana ye there the head perch upon
the knee it sat in all it ugli the vertebr project a full
inch abov the level of the shrunken flesh of the neck for all the
world like a black doubl of hamilton tighe2 over the surfac of the
corps there wa gather a thin glassi film that made it appear
yet more appal for which we were at the moment quit unabl to
account till present we observ that from the roof of the chamber
the water fell steadili drip drop drip on to the neck of the
corps whenc it ran down over the entir surfac and final escap
into the rock through a tini hole in the tabl then i guess what the
film wastwala bodi wa be transform into a stalactit
a look at the white form seat on the stone bench which ran round
that ghastli board confirm thi view thei were human bodi inde
or rather thei had been human now thei were stalactit thi wa
the wai in which the kukuana peopl had from time immemori preserv
their royal dead thei petrifi them what the exact system might be
if there wa ani beyond the place of them for a long period of year
under the drip i never discov but there thei sat ic over and
preserv for ever by the silic fluid
anyth more aweinspir than the spectacl of thi long line of
depart royalti there were twentyseven of them the last be
ignosi father wrap each of them in a shroud of icelik spar
through which the featur could be dimli discov and seat round
that inhospit board with death himself for a host it is
imposs to imagin that the practic of thu preserv their king
must have been an ancient on is evid from the number which
allow for an averag reign of fifteen year suppos that everi
king who reign wa place herean improb thing as some ar sure
to have perish in battl far from homewould fix the date of it
commenc at four and a quarter centuri back
but the coloss death who sit at the head of the board is far older
than that and unless i am much mistaken ow hi origin to the same
artist who design the three colossi he is hewn out of a singl
stalactit and look at as a work of art is most admir
conceiv and execut good who understand such thing declar
that so far as he could see the anatom design of the skeleton is
perfect down to the smallest bone
my own idea is that thi terrif object wa a freak of fanci on the
part of some oldworld sculptor and that it presenc had suggest to
the kukuana the idea of place their royal dead under it aw
presid or perhap it wa set there to frighten awai ani maraud
who might have design upon the treasur chamber beyond i cannot sai
all i can do is to describ it as it is and the reader must form hi
own conclus
such at ani rate wa the white death and such were the white dead

good my lord and she hobbl round to the back of the great death
here is the chamber let my lord light the lamp and enter and she
place the gourd full of oil upon the floor and lean herself against
the side of the cave i took out a match of which we had still a few
in a box and lit a rush wick and then look for the doorwai but
there wa noth befor us except the solid rock gagool grin the
wai is there my lord ha ha ha
do not jest with us i said sternli
i jest not my lord see and she point at the rock
as she did so on hold up the lamp we perceiv that a mass of stone
wa rise slowli from the floor and vanish into the rock abov
where doubtless there is a caviti prepar to receiv it the mass wa
of the width of a goodsiz door about ten feet high and not less
than five feet thick it must have weigh at least twenti or thirti
ton and wa clearli move upon some simpl balanc principl of
counterweight probabl the same as that by which the open and
shut of an ordinari modern window is arrang how the principl
wa set in motion of cours none of us saw gagool wa care to
avoid thi but i have littl doubt that there wa some veri simpl
lever which wa move ever so littl by pressur at a secret spot
therebi throw addit weight on to the hidden counterbal
and caus the monolith to be lift from the ground
veri slowli and gentli the great stone rais itself till at last it
had vanish altogeth and a dark hole present itself to us in the
place which the door had fill
our excit wa so intens as we saw the wai to solomon treasur
chamber thrown open at last that i for on began to trembl and shake
would it prove a hoax after all i wonder or wa old da silvestra
right were there vast hoard of wealth hidden in that dark place
hoard which would make us the richest men in the whole world we
should know in a minut or two
enter white men from the star said gagool advanc into the
doorwai but first hear your servant gagool the old the bright
stone that ye will see were dug out of the pit over which the silent
on ar set and store here i know not by whom for that wa done
longer ago than even i rememb but onc ha thi place been enter
sinc the time that those who hid the stone depart in hast leav
them behind the report of the treasur went down inde among the
peopl who live in the countri from ag to ag but none knew where
the chamber wa nor the secret of the door but it happen that a
white man reach thi countri from over the mountainsperch he
too came from the starsand wa well receiv by the king of that
dai he it is who sit yonder and she point to the fifth king at
the tabl of the dead and it came to pass that he and a woman of the
countri who wa with him journei to thi place and that by chanc
the woman learnt the secret of the doora thousand year might ye
search but ye should never find that secret then the white man
enter with the woman and found the stone and fill with stone
the skin of a small goat which the woman had with her to hold food
and as he wa go from the chamber he took up on more stone a larg
on and held it in hi hand
here she paus
well i ask breathless with interest as we all were what
happen to da silvestra
the old hag start at the mention of the name
how knowest thou the dead man name she ask sharpli and then
without wait for an answer went on
none can tell what happen but it came about that the white man wa
frighten for he flung down the goatskin with the stone and fled
out with onli the on stone in hi hand and that the king took and it
is the stone which thou macumazahn didst take from twala brow
have none enter here sinc i ask peer again down the dark
passag
none my lord onli the secret of the door ha been kept and everi
king ha open it though he ha not enter there is a sai that
those who enter there will die within a moon even as the white man
di in the cave upon the mountain where ye found him macumazahn and
therefor the king do not enter ha ha mine ar true word
our ey met as she said it and i turn sick and cold how did the
old hag know all these thing
enter my lord if i speak truth the goatskin with the stone will
lie upon the floor and if there is truth as to whether it is death to
enter here that ye will learn afterward ha ha ha and she
hobbl through the doorwai bear the light with her but i confess
that onc more i hesit about follow
oh confound it all said good here goe i am not go to be
frighten by that old devil and follow by foulata who howev
evid did not at all like the busi for she wa shiver with
fear he plung into the passag after gagoolan exampl which we
quickli follow
a few yard down the passag in the narrow wai hewn out of the live
rock gagool had paus and wa wait for us
see my lord she said hold the light befor her those who
store the treasur here fled in hast and bethought them to guard
against ani who should find the secret of the door but had not the
time and she point to larg squar block of stone which to the
height of two cours about two feet three had been place across
the passag with a view to wall it up along the side of the passag
were similar block readi for us and most curiou of all a heap of
mortar and a coupl of trowel which tool so far as we had time to
examin them appear to be of a similar shape and make to those us
by workmen to thi dai
here foulata who had been in a state of great fear and agit
throughout said that she felt faint and could go no farther but would
wait there accordingli we set her down on the unfinish wall place
the basket of provis by her side and left her to recov
follow the passag for about fifteen pace farther we came suddenli
to an elabor paint wooden door it wa stand wide open
whoever wa last there had either not found the time to shut it or had
forgotten to do so
across the threshold of thi door lai a skin bag form of a
goatskin that appear to be full of pebbl
hee hee white men snigger gagool as the light from the lamp
fell upon it what did i tell you that the white man who came here
fled in hast and drop the woman bagbehold it look within also
and ye will find a watergourd amongst the stone
good stoop down and lift it it wa heavi and jingl
by jove i believ it full of diamond he said in an aw
whisper and inde the idea of a small goatskin full of diamond is
enough to aw anybodi
go on said sir henri impati here old ladi give me the
lamp and take it from gagool hand he step through the doorwai
and held it high abov hi head
we press in after him forget for the moment of the bag of
diamond and found ourselv in king solomon treasur chamber
at first all that the somewhat faint light given by the lamp reveal
wa a room hewn out of the live rock and appar not more than
ten feet squar next there came into sight store on on the other to
the arch of the roof a splendid collect of elephanttusk how mani
of them there were we did not know for of cours we could not see to
what depth thei went back but there could not have been less than the
end of four or five hundr tusk of the first qualiti visibl to our
ey there alon wa enough ivori to make a man wealthi for life
perhap i thought it wa from thi veri store that solomon drew the
raw materi for hi great throne of ivori of which there wa not
the like made in ani kingdom
on the opposit side of the chamber were about a score of wooden box
someth like martinihenri ammunit box onli rather larger and
paint red
there ar the diamond cri i bring the light
sir henri did so hold it close to the top box of which the lid
render rotten by time even in that dry place appear to have been
smash in probabl by da silvestra himself push my hand through
the hole in the lid i drew it out full not of diamond but of gold
piec of a shape that none of us had seen befor and with what
look like hebrew charact stamp upon them
ah i said replac the coin we shant go back emptyhand
anyhow there must be a coupl of thousand piec in each box and
there ar eighteen box i suppos thi wa the monei to pai the
workmen and merchant
well put in good i think that is the lot i dont see ani
diamond unless the old portugues put them all into hi bag
let my lord look yonder where it is darkest if thei would find the
stone said gagool interpret our look there my lord will find
a nook and three stone chest in the nook two seal and on open
befor translat thi to sir henri who carri the light i could
not resist ask how she knew these thing if no on had enter the
place sinc the white man gener ago
ah macumazahn the watcher by night wa the mock answer ye who
dwell in the star do ye not know that some live long and that some
have ey which can see through rock ha ha ha
look in that corner curti i said indic the spot gagool had
point out
hullo you fellow he cri here a recess great heaven see
here
we hurri up to where he wa stand in a nook shape someth like
a small bow window against the wall of thi recess were place three
stone chest each about two feet squar two were fit with stone
lid the lid of the third rest against the side of the chest which
wa open
see he repeat hoars hold the lamp over the open chest we
look and for a moment could make noth out on account of a
silveri sheen which dazzl us when our ey grew us to it we saw
that the chest wa threepart full of uncut diamond most of them of
consider size stoop i pick some up ye there wa no doubt
of it there wa the unmistak soapi feel about them
i fairli gasp as i drop them
we ar the richest men in the whole world i said mont christo wa
a fool to us
we shall flood the market with diamond said good
got to get them there first suggest sir henri
we stood still with pale face and stare at each other the lantern in
the middl and the glimmer gem below as though we were
conspir about to commit a crime instead of be as we thought
the most fortun men on earth
hee hee hee cackl old gagool behind us as she flit about
like a vampir bat there ar the bright stone ye love white men as
mani as ye will take them run them through your finger eat of
them hee hee drink of them ha ha
at that moment there wa someth so ridicul to my mind at the idea
of eat and drink diamond that i began to laugh outrag an
exampl which the other follow without know why there we stood
and shriek with laughter over the gem that were our which had been
found for us thousand of year ago by the patient delver in the
great hole yonder and store for us by solomon longdead overs
whose name perchanc wa written in the charact stamp on the
fade wax that yet adher to the lid of the chest solomon never got
them nor david or da silvestra nor anybodi els we had got them
there befor us were million of pound worth of diamond and
thousand of pound worth of gold and ivori onli wait to be taken
awai
suddenli the fit pass off and we stop laugh
open the other chest white men croak gagool there ar sure
more therein take your fill white lord ha ha take your fill
thu adjur we set to work to pull up the stone lid on the other
two firstnot without a feel of sacrilegebreak the seal that
fasten them
hoorah thei were full too full to the brim at least the second on
wa no wretch burglari da silvestra had been fill goatskin
out of that as for the third chest it wa onli about a fourth full
but the stone were all pick on none less than twenti carat and
some of them as larg as pigeonegg a good mani of these bigger on
howev we could see by hold them up to the light were a littl
yellow off colour as thei call it at kimberlei
what we did not see howev wa the look of fear malevol
that old gagool favour us with as she crept crept like a snake out
of the treasur chamber and down the passag toward the door of solid
rock
hark cry upon cry come ring up the vault path it is foulata
voic
oh bougwan help help the stone fall
leav go girl then
help help she ha stab me
by now we ar run down the passag and thi is what the light from
the lamp show us the door of the rock is close down slowli it is
not three feet from the floor near it struggl foulata and gagool the
red blood of the former run to her knee but still the brave girl
hold the old witch who fight like a wild cat ah she is free
foulata fall and gagool throw herself on the ground to twist like a
snake through the crack of the close stone she is underah god
too late too late the stone nip her and she yell in agoni down
down it come all the thirti ton of it slowli press her old bodi
against the rock below shriek upon shriek such as we have never
heard then a long sicken crunch and the door wa shut just as
rush down the passag we hurl ourselv against it
it wa all done in four second
then we turn to foulata the poor girl wa stab in the bodi and i
saw that she could not live long
ah bougwan i die gasp the beauti creatur she crept
outgagool i did not see her i wa faintand the door began to
fall then she came back and wa look up the pathi saw her come
in through the slowli fall door and caught her and held her and
she stab me and i die bougwan
poor girl poor girl good cri in hi distress and then as he
could do noth els he fell to kiss her
bougwan she said after a paus is macumazahn there it grow so
dark i cannot see
here i am foulata
macumazahn be my tongu for a moment i prai thee for bougwan cannot
understand me and befor i go into the dark i would speak to him a
word
sai on foulata i will render it
sai to my lord bougwan thati love him and that i am glad to die
becaus i know that he cannot cumber hi life with such as i am for
the sun mai not mate with the dark nor the white with the black
sai that sinc i saw him at time i have felt as though there were a
bird in my bosom which would on dai fly henc and sing elsewher
even now though i cannot lift my hand and my brain grow cold i do
not feel as though my heart were dy it is so full of love that it
could live ten thousand year and yet be young sai that if i live
again mayhap i shall see him in the star and thati will search
them all though perchanc there i should still be black and he
wouldstil be white saynai macumazahn sai no more save that i
loveoh hold me closer bougwan i cannot feel thine armsoh oh
she is deadsh is dead mutter good rise in grief the tear
run down hi honest face
you need not let that troubl you old fellow said sir henri
eh exclaim good what do you mean
i mean that you will soon be in a posit to join her man dont
you see that we ar buri aliv
until sir henri utter these word i do not think that the full horror
of what had happen had come home to us preoccupi as we were with
the sight of poor foulata end but now we understood the ponder
mass of rock had close probabl for ever for the onli brain which
knew it secret wa crush to powder beneath it weight thi wa a
door that none could hope to forc with anyth short of dynamit in
larg quantiti and we were on the wrong side
for a few minut we stood horrifi there over the corps of foulata
all the manhood seem to have gone out of us the first shock of thi
idea of the slow and miser end that await us wa overpow we
saw it all now that fiend gagool had plan thi snare for us from
the first
it would have been just the jest that her evil mind would have rejoic
in the idea of the three white men whom for some reason of her own
she had alwai hate slowli perish of thirst and hunger in the
compani of the treasur thei had covet now i saw the point of that
sneer of her about eat and drink the diamond probabl somebodi
had tri to serv the poor old dom in the same wai when he abandon
the skin full of jewel
thi will never do said sir henri hoars the lamp will soon go
out let us see if we cant find the spring that work the rock
we sprang forward with desper energi and stand in a bloodi
ooz began to feel up and down the door and the side of the passag
but no knob or spring could we discov
depend on it i said it doe not work from the insid if it did
gagool would not have risk try to crawl underneath the stone it
wa the knowledg of thi that made her try to escap at all hazard
curs her
at all event said sir henri with a hard littl laugh retribut
wa swift her wa almost as aw an end as our is like to be we
can do noth with the door let us go back to the treasur room
we turn and went and as we pass it i perceiv by the unfinish
wall across the passag the basket of food which poor foulata had
carri i took it up and brought it with me to the accurs treasur
chamber that wa to be our grave then we return and rever bore
in foulata corps lai it on the floor by the box of coin
next we seat ourselv lean our back against the three stone
chest which contain the priceless treasur
let us divid the food said sir henri so as to make it last as
long as possibl accordingli we did so it would we reckon make
four infinitesim small meal for each of us enough sai to
support life for a coupl of dai besid the biltong or dri
gameflesh there were two gourd of water each of which held not more
than a quart
now said sir henri grimli let us eat and drink for tomorrow we
die
we each at a small portion of the biltong and drank a sip of water
needless to sai we had but littl appetit though we were sadli in
need of food and felt better after swallow it then we got up and
made a systemat examin of the wall of our prisonhous in the
faint hope of find some mean of exit sound them and the floor
carefulli
there wa none it wa not probabl that there would be ani to a
treasur chamber
the lamp began to burn dim the fat wa nearli exhaust
quatermain said sir henri what is the timeyour watch goe
i drew it out and look at it it wa six oclock we had enter the
cave at eleven
infadoo will miss us i suggest if we do not return tonight he
will search for us in the morn curti
he mai search in vain he doe not know the secret of the door nor
even where it is no live person knew it yesterdai except gagool
todai no on know it even if he found the door he could not break it
down all the kukuana armi could not break through five feet of live
rock my friend i see noth for it but to bow ourselv to the will
of the almighti the search for treasur ha brought mani to a bad end
we shall go to swell their number
the lamp grew dimmer yet
present it flare up and show the whole scene in strong relief the
great mass of white tusk the box of gold the corps of the poor
foulata stretch befor them the goatskin full of treasur the dim
glimmer of the diamond and the wild wan face of us three white men
seat there await death by starvat
then the flame sank and expir
chapter xviii
we abandon hope
i can give no adequ descript of the horror of the night which
follow mercifulli thei were to some extent mitig by sleep for
even in such a posit as our weari natur will sometim assert
itself but i at ani rate found it imposs to sleep much put
asid the terrifi thought of our impend doomfor the bravest man
on earth might well quail from such a fate as await us and i never
made ani pretens to be braveth silenc itself wa too great to
allow of it reader you mai have lain awak at night and thought the
quiet oppress but i sai with confid that you can have no idea
what a vivid tangibl thing is perfect still on the surfac of
the earth there is alwai some sound or motion and though it mai in
itself be impercept yet it deaden the sharp edg of absolut
silenc but here there wa none we were buri in the bowel of a
huge snowclad peak thousand of feet abov us the fresh air rush
over the white snow but no sound of it reach us we were separ
by a long tunnel and five feet of rock even from the aw chamber of
the dead and the dead make no nois did we not know it who lai by
poor foulata side the crash of all the artilleri of earth and
heaven could not have come to our ear in our live tomb we were cut
off from everi echo of the worldw were as men alreadi in the grave
then the ironi of the situat forc itself upon me there around us
lai treasur enough to pai off a moder nation debt or to build a
fleet of ironclad and yet we would have barter them all gladli for
the faintest chanc of escap soon doubtless we should be rejoic
to exchang them for a bit of food or a cup of water and after that
even for the privileg of a speedi close to our suffer truli
wealth which men spend their live in acquir is a valueless thing
at the last
and so the night wore on
good said sir henri voic at last and it sound aw in the
intens still how mani match have you in the box
eight curti
strike on and let us see the time
he did so and in contrast to the dens dark the flame nearli
blind us it wa five oclock by my watch the beauti dawn wa now
blush on the snowwreath far over our head and the breez would
be stir the night mist in the hollow
we had better eat someth and keep up our strength i suggest
what is the good of eat answer good the sooner we die and get
it over the better
while there is life there is hope said sir henri
accordingli we at and sip some water and anoth period of time
elaps then sir henri suggest that it might be well to get as near
the door as possibl and halloa on the faint chanc of somebodi
catch a sound outsid accordingli good who from long practic at
sea ha a fine pierc note grope hi wai down the passag and set
to work i must sai that he made a most diabol nois i never heard
such yell but it might have been a mosquito buzz for all the
effect thei produc
after a while he gave it up and came back veri thirsti and had to
drink then we stop yell as it encroach on the suppli of water
so we sat down onc more against the chest of useless diamond in that
dread inact which wa on of the hardest circumst of our
fate and i am bound to sai that for my part i gave wai in despair
lai my head against sir henri broad shoulder i burst into tear
and i think that i heard good gulp awai on the other side and
swear hoars at himself for do so
ah how good and brave that great man wa had we been two frighten
children and he our nurs he could not have treat us more tenderli
forget hi own share of miseri he did all he could to sooth our
broken nerv tell stori of men who had been in somewhat similar
circumst and miracul escap and when these fail to cheer
us point out how after all it wa onli anticip an end which
must come to us all that it would soon be over and that death from
exhaust wa a merci on which is not true then in a diffid
sort of wai as onc befor i had heard him do he suggest that we
should throw ourselv on the merci of a higher power which for my
part i did with great vigour
hi is a beauti charact veri quiet but veri strong
and so somehow the dai went as the night had gone if inde on can
us these term where all wa densest night and when i lit a match to
see the time it wa seven oclock
onc more we at and drank and as we did so an idea occur to me
how is it said i that the air in thi place keep fresh it is
thick and heavi but it is perfectli fresh
great heaven said good start up i never thought of that it
cant come through the stone door for it airtight if ever a door
wa it must come from somewher it there were no current of air in
the place we should have been stifl or poison when we first came
in let us have a look
it wa wonder what a chang thi mere spark of hope wrought in us
in a moment we were all three grope about on our hand and knee
feel for the slightest indic of a draught present my ardour
receiv a check i put my hand on someth cold it wa dead
foulata face
for an hour or more we went on feel about till at last sir henri
and i gave it up in despair have been consider hurt by
constantli knock our head against tusk chest and the side of
the chamber but good still persev sai with an approach to
cheer that it wa better than do noth
i sai you fellow he said present in a constrain sort of
voic come here
needless to sai we scrambl toward him quickli enough
quatermain put your hand here where mine is now do you feel
anyth
i think i feel air come up
now listen he rose and stamp upon the place and a flame of hope
shot up in our heart it rang hollow
with trembl hand i lit a match i had onli three left and we saw
that we were in the angl of the far corner of the chamber a fact that
account for our not have notic the hollow sound of the place
dure our former exhaust examin as the match burnt we
scrutinis the spot there wa a join in the solid rock floor and
great heaven there let in level with the rock wa a stone ring we
said no word we were too excit and our heart beat too wildli with
hope to allow us to speak good had a knife at the back of which wa
on of those hook that ar made to extract stone from hors hoof
he open it and scratch round the ring with it final he work
it under and lever awai gentli for fear of break the hook the
ring began to move be of stone it had not rust fast in all the
centuri it had lain there as would have been the case had it been of
iron present it wa upright then he thrust hi hand into it and
tug with all hi forc but noth budg
let me try i said impati for the situat of the stone right
in the angl of the corner wa such that it wa imposs for two to
pull at onc i took hold and strain awai but no result
then sir henri tri and fail
take the hook again good scratch all round the crack where we felt
the air come up
now curti he said tackl on and put your back into it you ar
as strong as two stop and he took off a stout black silk
handkerchief which true to hi habit of neat he still wore and
ran it through the ring quatermain get curti round the middl and
pull for dear life when i give the word now
sir henri put out all hi enorm strength and good and i did the
same with such power as natur had given us
heav heav it give gasp sir henri and i heard the muscl
of hi great back crack suddenli there wa a grate sound then a
rush of air and we were all on our back on the floor with a heavi
flagston upon the top of us sir henri strength had done it and
never did muscular power stand a man in better stead
light a match quatermain he said so soon as we had pick
ourselv up and got our breath carefulli now
i did so and there befor us heaven be prais wa the first step
of a stone stair
now what is to be done ask good
follow the stair of cours and trust to provid
stop said sir henri quatermain get the bit of biltong and the
water that ar left we mai want them
i went creep back to our place by the chest for that purpos and
as i wa come awai an idea struck me we had not thought much of the
diamond for the last twentyfour hour or so inde the veri idea of
diamond wa nauseou see what thei had entail upon us but
reflect i i mai as well pocket some in case we ever should get out
of thi ghastli hole so i just put my fist into the first chest and
fill all the avail pocket of my old shootingcoat and trouser
top upthi wa a happi thoughtwith a few hand of big on
from the third chest also by an afterthought i stuf foulata
basket which except for on watergourd and a littl biltong wa
empti now with great quantiti of the stone
i sai you fellow i sang out wont you take some diamond with
you iv fill my pocket and the basket
oh come on quatermain and hang the diamond said sir henri i
hope that i mai never see anoth
as for good he made no answer he wa i think take hi last
farewel of all that wa left of the poor girl who had love him so
well and curiou as it mai seem to you my reader sit at home at
eas and reflect on the vast inde the immeasur wealth which
we were thu abandon i can assur you that if you had pass some
twentyeight hour with next to noth to eat and drink in that place
you would not have care to cumber yourself with diamond whilst
plung down into the unknown bowel of the earth in the wild hope of
escap from an agonis death if from the habit of a lifetim it
had not becom a sort of second natur with me never to leav anyth
worth have behind if there wa the slightest chanc of my be abl
to carri it awai i am sure that i should not have bother to fill my
pocket and that basket
come on quatermain repeat sir henri who wa alreadi stand on
the first step of the stone stair steadi i will go first
mind where you put your feet there mai be some aw hole
underneath i answer
much more like to be anoth room said sir henri while he
descend slowli count the step as he went
when he got to fifteen he stop here the bottom he said
thank good i think it a passag follow me down
good went next and i came last carri the basket and on reach
the bottom lit on of the two remain match by it light we could
just see that we were stand in a narrow tunnel which ran right and
left at right angl to the staircas we had descend befor we could
make out ani more the match burnt my finger and went out then aros
the delic question of which wai to go of cours it wa imposs
to know what the tunnel wa or where it led to and yet to turn on
wai might lead us to safeti and the other to destruct we were
utterli perplex till suddenli it struck good that when i had lit the
match the draught of the passag blew the flame to the left
let us go against the draught he said air draw inward not
outward
we took thi suggest and feel along the wall with our hand
whilst try the ground befor us at everi step we depart from that
accurs treasur chamber on our terribl quest for life if ever it
should be enter again by live man which i do not think probabl
he will find token of our visit in the open chest of jewel the
empti lamp and the white bone of poor foulata
when we had grope our wai for about a quarter of an hour along the
passag suddenli it took a sharp turn or els wa bisect by
anoth which we follow onli in cours of time to be led into a
third and so it went on for some hour we seem to be in a stone
labyrinth that led nowher what all these passag ar of cours i
cannot sai but we thought that thei must be the ancient work of a
mine of which the variou shaft and adit travel hither and
thither as the or led them thi is the onli wai in which we could
account for such a multitud of galleri
at length we halt thoroughli worn out with fatigu and with that
hope defer which maketh the heart sick and at up our poor
remain piec of biltong and drank our last sup of water for our
throat were like limekiln it seem to us that we had escap death
in the dark of the treasur chamber onli to meet him in the
dark of the tunnel
as we stood onc more utterli depress i thought that i caught a
sound to which i call the attent of the other it wa veri faint
and veri far off but it wa a sound a faint murmur sound for
the other heard it too and no word can describ the blessed of
it after all those hour of utter aw still
by heaven it run water said good come on
off we start again in the direct from which the faint murmur
seem to come grope our wai as befor along the rocki wall i
rememb that i laid down the basket full of diamond wish to be
rid of it weight but on second thought took it up again on might
as well die rich as poor i reflect as we went the sound becam more
and more audibl till at last it seem quit loud in the quiet on
yet on now we could distinctli make out the unmistak swirl of
rush water and yet how could there be run water in the bowel
of the earth now we were quit near it and good who wa lead
swore that he could smell it
go gentli good said sir henri we must be close splash and a
cry from good
he had fallen in
good good where ar you we shout in terrifi distress to our
intens relief an answer came back in a choki voic
all right iv got hold of a rock strike a light to show me where
you ar
hastili i lit the last remain match it faint gleam discov to
us a dark mass of water run at our feet how wide it wa we could
not see but there some wai out wa the dark form of our companion
hang on to a project rock
stand clear to catch me sung out good i must swim for it
then we heard a splash and a great struggl anoth minut and he had
grab at and caught sir henri outstretch hand and we had pull
him up high and dry into the tunnel
my word he said between hi gasp that wa touch and go if i
hadnt manag to catch that rock and known how to swim i should have
been done it run like a millrac and i could feel no bottom
we dare not follow the bank of the subterranean river for fear lest
we should fall into it again in the dark so after good had rest
a while and we had drunk our fill of the water which wa sweet and
fresh and wash our face that need it sadli as well as we could
we start from the bank of thi african styx and began to retrac
our step along the tunnel good drip unpleasantli in front of us
at length we came to anoth galleri lead to our right
we mai as well take it said sir henri wearili all road ar alik
here we can onli go on till we drop
slowli for a long long while we stumbl utterli exhaust along
thi new tunnel sir henri now lead the wai again i thought of
abandon that basket but did not
suddenli he stop and we bump up against him
look he whisper is my brain go or is that light
we stare with all our ey and there ye there far ahead of us
wa a faint glimmer spot no larger than a cottag window pane it
wa so faint that i doubt if ani ey except those which like our
had for dai seen noth but black could have perceiv it at all
with a gasp of hope we push on in five minut there wa no longer
ani doubt it wa a patch of faint light a minut more and a breath
of real live air wa fan us on we struggl all at onc the
tunnel narrow sir henri went on hi knee smaller yet it grew till
it wa onli the size of a larg fox earthit wa earth now mind
you the rock had ceas
a squeez a struggl and sir henri wa out and so wa good and so
wa i drag foulata basket after me and there abov us were the
bless star and in our nostril wa the sweet air then suddenli
someth gave and we were all roll over and over and over through
grass and bush and soft wet soil
the basket caught in someth and i stop sit up i hallo
lustili an answer shout came from below where sir henri wild
career had been check by some level ground i scrambl to him and
found him unhurt though breathless then we look for good a littl
wai off we discov him also ham in a fork root he wa a good
deal knock about but soon came to himself
we sat down togeth there on the grass and the revuls of feel
wa so great that realli i think we cri with joi we had escap from
that aw dungeon which wa so near to becom our grave sure
some merci power guid our footstep to the jackal hole for that
is what it must have been at the termin of the tunnel and see
yonder on the mountain the dawn we had never thought to look upon
again wa blush rosi red
present the grei light stole down the slope and we saw that we were
at the bottom or rather nearli at the bottom of the vast pit in
front of the entranc to the cave now we could make out the dim form
of the three colossi who sat upon it verg doubtless those aw
passag along which we had wander the livelong night had been
origin in some wai connect with the great diamond mine as for
the subterranean river in the bowel of the mountain heaven onli know
what it is or whenc it flow or whither it goe i for on have no
anxieti to trace it cours
lighter it grew and lighter yet we could see each other now and such
a spectacl as we present i have never set ey on befor or sinc
gauntcheek hollowei wretch smear all over with dust and
mud bruis bleed the long fear of immin death yet written on
our counten we were inde a sight to frighten the daylight
and yet it is a solemn fact that good eyeglass wa still fix in
good ey i doubt whether he had ever taken it out at all neither
the dark nor the plung in the subterranean river nor the roll
down the slope had been abl to separ good and hi eyeglass
present we rose fear that our limb would stiffen if we stop
there longer and commenc with slow and pain step to struggl up
the slope side of the great pit for an hour or more we toil
steadfastli up the blue clai drag ourselv on by the help of the
root and grass with which it wa cloth but now i had no more
thought of leav the basket inde noth but death should have
part us
at last it wa done and we stood by the great road on that side of
the pit which is opposit to the colossi
at the side of the road a hundr yard off a fire wa burn in
front of some hut and round the fire were figur we stagger
toward them support on anoth and halt everi few pace
present on of the figur rose saw us and fell on to the ground
cry out for fear
infadoo infadoo it is we thy friend
he rose he ran to us stare wildli and still shake with fear
oh my lord my lord it is inde you come back from the
deadcom back from the dead
and the old warrior flung himself down befor us and clasp sir
henri knee he wept aloud for joi
chapter xix
ignosi farewel
ten dai from that event morn found us onc more in our old
quarter at loo and strang to sai but littl the wors for our
terribl experi except that my stubbl hair came out of the
treasur cave about three shade greyer than it went in and that good
never wa quit the same after foulata death which seem to move
him veri greatli i am bound to sai look at the thing from the
point of view of an oldish man of the world that i consid her
remov wa a fortun occurr sinc otherwis complic
would have been sure to ensu the poor creatur wa no ordinari nativ
girl but a person of great i had almost said state beauti and of
consider refin of mind but no amount of beauti or refin
could have made an entangl between good and herself a desir
occurr for as she herself put it can the sun mate with the
dark or the white with the black
i need hardli state that we never again penetr into solomon
treasur chamber after we had recov from our fatigu a process
which took us fortyeight hour we descend into the great pit in the
hope of find the hole by which we had crept out of the mountain but
with no success to begin with rain had fallen and obliter our
spoor and what is more the side of the vast pit were full of
antbear and other hole it wa imposs to sai to which of these we
ow our salvat also on the dai befor we start back to loo we
made a further examin of the wonder of the stalactit cave and
drawn by a kind of restless feel even penetr onc more into the
chamber of the dead pass beneath the spear of the white death we
gaze with sensat which it would be quit imposs for me to
describ at the mass of rock that had shut us off from escap
think the while of priceless treasur beyond of the mysteri old
hag whose flatten fragment lai crush beneath it and of the fair
girl of whose tomb it wa the portal i sai gaze at the rock for
examin as we could we could find no trace of the join of the slide
door nor inde could we hit upon the secret now utterli lost that
work it though we tri for an hour or more it is certainli a
marvel bit of mechan characterist in it massiv and yet
inscrut simplic of the ag which produc it and i doubt if
the world ha such anoth to show
at last we gave it up in disgust though if the mass had suddenli
risen befor our ey i doubt if we should have screw up courag to
step over gagool mangl remain and onc more enter the treasur
chamber even in the sure and certain hope of unlimit diamond and
yet i could have cri at the idea of leav all that treasur the
biggest treasur probabl that in the world histori ha ever been
accumul in on spot but there wa no help for it onli dynamit
could forc it wai through five feet of solid rock
so we left it perhap in some remot unborn centuri a more fortun
explor mai hit upon the open sesam and flood the world with gem
but myself i doubt it somehow i seem to feel that the ten of
million of pound worth of jewel which lie in the three stone
coffer will never shine round the neck of an earthli beauti thei and
foulata bone will keep cold compani till the end of all thing
with a sigh of disappoint we made our wai back and next dai
start for loo and yet it wa realli veri ungrat of us to be
disappoint for as the reader will rememb by a lucki thought i
had taken the precaut to fill the wide pocket of my old shoot
coat and trouser with gem befor we left our prisonhous also
foulata basket which held twice as mani more notwithstand that
the water bottl had occupi some of it space a good mani of these
fell out in the cours of our roll down the side of the pit includ
sever of the big on which i had cram in on the top in my coat
pocket but compar speak an enorm quantiti still
remain includ ninetythre larg stone rang from over two
hundr to seventi carat in weight my old shoot coat and the
basket still held suffici treasur to make us all if not
millionair as the term is understood in america at least exceedingli
wealthi men and yet to keep enough stone each to make the three
finest set of gem in europ so we had not done so badli
on arriv at loo we were most cordial receiv by ignosi whom we
found well and busili engag in consolid hi power and
reorganis the regiment which had suffer most in the great
struggl with twala
he listen with intens interest to our wonder stori but when we
told him of old gagool fright end he grew thought
come hither he call to a veri old induna or councillor who wa
sit with other in a circl round the king but out of earshot
the ancient man rose approach salut and seat himself
thou art ag said ignosi
ay my lord the king thy father father and i were born on the same
dai
tell me when thou wast littl didst thou know gagaoola the witch
doctress
ay my lord the king
how wa she thenyoung like thee
not so my lord the king she wa even as she is now and as she wa in
the dai of my great grandfath befor me old and dri veri ugli
and full of wicked
she is no more she is dead
so o king then is an ancient curs taken from the land
go
koom i go black puppi who tore out the old dog throat koom
ye see my brother said ignosi thi wa a strang woman and i
rejoic that she is dead she would have let you die in the dark place
and mayhap afterward she had found a wai to slai me as she found a
wai to slai my father and set up twala whom her black heart love in
hi place now go on with the tale sure there never wa it like
after i had narrat all the stori of our escap as we had agre
between ourselv that i should i took the opportun to address
ignosi as to our departur from kukuanaland
and now ignosi i said the time ha come for us to bid thee
farewel and start to see our own land onc more behold ignosi thou
camest with us a servant and now we leav thee a mighti king if thou
art grate to us rememb to do even as thou didst promis to rule
justli to respect the law and to put none to death without a caus
so shalt thou prosper tomorrow at break of dai ignosi thou wilt
give us an escort who shall lead us across the mountain is it not so
o king
ignosi cover hi face with hi hand for a while befor answer
my heart is sore he said at last your word split my heart in
twain what have i done to you incubu macumazahn and bougwan that
ye should leav me desol ye who stood by me in rebellion and in
battl will ye leav me in the dai of peac and victori what will
yewiv choos from among the maiden a place to live in behold
the land is your as far as ye can see the white man hous ye
shall teach my peopl how to build them cattl for beef and milk
everi marri man shall bring you an ox or a cow wild game to hunt
doe not the eleph walk through my forest and the riverhors
sleep in the reed would ye make war my impi wait your word if
there is anyth more which i can give that will i give you
nai ignosi we want none of these thing i answer we would seek
our own place
now do i learn said ignosi bitterli and with flash ey that
ye love the bright stone more than me your friend ye have the
stone now ye would go to natal and across the move black water and
sell them and be rich as it is the desir of a white man heart to
be curs for your sake be the white stone and curs he who seek
them death shall it be to him who set foot in the place of death to
find them i have spoken white men ye can go
i laid my hand upon hi arm ignosi i said tell us when thou
didst wander in zululand and among the white peopl of natal did not
thine heart turn to the land thy mother told thee of thy nativ place
where thou didst see the light and plai when thou wast littl the
land where thy place wa
it wa even so macumazahn
in like manner ignosi do our heart turn to our land and to our own
place
then came a silenc when ignosi broke it it wa in a differ voic
i do perceiv that now as ever thy word ar wise and full of reason
macumazahn that which fli in the air love not to run along the
ground the white man love not to live on the level of the black or to
hous among hi kraal well ye must go and leav my heart sore
becaus ye will be as dead to me sinc from where ye ar no tide
can come to me
but listen and let all your brother know my word no other white
man shall cross the mountain even if ani man live to come so far i
will see no trader with their gun and gin my peopl shall fight with
the spear and drink water like their forefath befor them i will
have no prayingmen to put a fear of death into men heart to stir
them up against the law of the king and make a path for the white folk
who follow to run on if a white man come to my gate i will send him
back if a hundr come i will push them back if armi come i will
make war on them with all my strength and thei shall not prevail
against me none shall ever seek for the shine stone no not an
armi for if thei come i will send a regiment and fill up the pit and
break down the white column in the cave and choke them with rock so
that none can reach even to that door of which ye speak and whereof
the wai to move it is lost but for you three incubu macumazahn and
bougwan the path is alwai open for behold ye ar dearer to me than
aught that breath
and ye would go infadoo my uncl and my induna shall take you by
the hand and guid you with a regiment there is as i have learn
anoth wai across the mountain that he shall show you farewel my
brother brave white men see me no more for i have no heart to bear
it behold i make a decre and it shall be publish from the
mountain to the mountain your name incubu macumazahn and
bougwan shall be hlonipa even as the name of dead king and he
who speak them shall die1 so shall your memori be preserv in the
land for ever
go now er my ey rain tear like a woman at time as ye look
back down the path of life or when ye ar old and gather yourselv
togeth to crouch befor the fire becaus for you the sun ha no more
heat ye will think of how we stood shoulder to shoulder in that great
battl which thy wise word plan macumazahn of how thou wast the
point of the horn that gall twala flank bougwan whilst thou stood
in the ring of the grei incubu and men went down befor thine ax
like corn befor a sickl ay and of how thou didst break that wild
bull twala strength and bring hi pride to dust fare ye well for
ever incubu macumazahn and bougwan my lord and my friend
ignosi rose and look earnestli at us for a few second then he threw
the corner of hi karross over hi head so as to cover hi face from
us
we went in silenc
next dai at dawn we left loo escort by our old friend infadoo who
wa heartbroken at our departur and by the regiment of buffalo
earli as wa the hour all the main street of the town wa line with
multitud of peopl who gave us the royal salut as we pass at the
head of the regiment while the women bless us for have rid the
land of twala throw flower befor us as we went it wa realli
veri affect and not the sort of thing on is accustom to meet
with from nativ
on ludicr incid occur howev which i rather welcom as
it gave us someth to laugh at
just befor we reach the confin of the town a pretti young girl
with some love lili in her hand ran forward and present them to
goodsomehow thei all seem to like good i think hi eyeglass and
solitari whisker gave him a fictiti valueand then said that she
had a boon to ask
speak on he answer
let my lord show hi servant hi beauti white leg that hi
servant mai look upon them and rememb them all her dai and tell of
them to her children hi servant ha travel four dai journei to
see them for the fame of them ha gone throughout the land
ill be hang if i do exclaim good excitedli
come come my dear fellow said sir henri you cant refus to
oblig a ladi
i wont repli good obstin it is posit indec
howev in the end he consent to draw up hi trouser to the knee
amidst note of raptur admir from all the women present
especi the gratifi young ladi and in thi guis he had to walk
till we got clear of the town
good leg i fear will never be so greatli admir again of hi
melt teeth and even of hi transpar ey the kukuana weari
more or less but of hi leg never
as we travel infadoo told us that there wa anoth pass over the
mountain to the north of the on follow by solomon great road or
rather that there wa a place where it wa possibl to climb down the
wall of cliff which separ kukuanaland from the desert and is
broken by the tower shape of sheba breast it appear also
that rather more than two year previous a parti of kukuana hunter
had descend thi path into the desert in search of ostrich whose
plume ar much prize among them for war headdress and that in the
cours of their hunt thei had been led far from the mountain and were
much troubl by thirst see tree on the horizon howev thei
walk toward them and discov a larg and fertil oasi some
mile in extent and plentifulli water it wa by wai of thi oasi
that infadoo suggest we should return and the idea seem to us a
good on for it appear that we should thu escap the rigour of the
mountain pass also some of the hunter were in attend to guid us
to the oasi from which thei state thei could perceiv other
fertil spot far awai in the desert2
travel easili on the night of the fourth dai journei we found
ourselv onc more on the crest of the mountain that separ
kukuanaland from the desert which roll awai in sandi billow at our
feet and about twentyf mile to the north of sheba breast
at dawn on the follow dai we were led to the edg of a veri
precipit chasm by which we were to descend the precipic and gain
the plain two thousand and more feet below
here we bade farewel to that true friend and sturdi old warrior
infadoo who solemnli wish all good upon us and nearli wept with
grief never my lord he said shall mine old ey see the like of
you again ah the wai that incubu cut hi men down in the battl ah
for the sight of that stroke with which he swept off my brother twala
head it wa beautifulbeauti i mai never hope to see such
anoth except perchanc in happi dream
we were veri sorri to part from him inde good wa so move that he
gave him as a souvenirwhat do you thinkan eyeglass afterward
we discov that it wa a spare on infadoo wa delight
forese that the possess of such an articl would increas hi
prestig enorm and after sever vain attempt he actual
succeed in screw it into hi own ey anyth more incongru
than the old warrior look with an eyeglass i never saw eyeglass
do not go well with leopardskin cloak and black ostrich plume
then after see that our guid were well laden with water and
provis and have receiv a thunder farewel salut from the
buffalo we wrung infadoo by the hand and began our downward climb
a veri arduou busi it prove to be but somehow that even we
found ourselv at the bottom without accid
do you know said sir henri that night as we sat by our fire and
gaze up at the beetl cliff abov us i think that there ar wors
place than kukuanaland in the world and that i have known unhappi
time than the last month or two though i have never spent such queer
on eh you fellow
i almost wish i were back said good with a sigh
as for myself i reflect that all well that end well but in the
cours of a long life of shave i never had such shave as those which
i had recent experienc the thought of that battl make me feel
cold all over and as for our experi in the treasur chamber
next morn we start on a toilsom trudg across the desert have
with us a good suppli of water carri by our five guid and camp
that night in the open march again at dawn on the morrow
by noon of the third dai journei we could see the tree of the oasi
of which the guid spoke and within an hour of sundown we were
walk onc more upon grass and listen to the sound of run
water
1 thi extraordinari and neg wai of show intens respect is
by no mean unknown among african peopl and the result is that if as
is usual the name in question ha a signific the mean must be
express by an idiom or other word in thi wai a memori is preserv
for gener or until the new word utterli supplant the old
2 it often puzzl all of us to understand how it wa possibl that
ignosi mother bear the child with her should have surviv the
danger of her journei across the mountain and the desert danger
which so nearli prove fatal to ourselv it ha sinc occur to me
and i give the idea to the reader for what it is worth that she must
have taken thi second rout and wander out like hagar into the
wilder if she did so there is no longer anyth inexplic
about the stori sinc as ignosi himself relat she mai well have
been pick up by some ostrich hunter befor she or the child wa
exhaust wa led by them to the oasi and thenc by stage to the
fertil countri and so on by slow degre southward to zululandaq
chapter xx
found
and now i come to perhap the strangest adventur that happen to us
in all thi strang busi and on which show how wonderfulli
thing ar brought about
i wa walk along quietli some wai in front of the other two down
the bank of the stream which run from the oasi till it is swallow
up in the hungri desert sand when suddenli i stop and rub my
ey as well i might there not twenti yard in front of me place
in a charm situat under the shade of a speci of figtre and
face to the stream wa a cosi hut built more or less on the kafir
principl with grass and with but have a fulllength door instead
of a beehol
what the dicken said i to myself can a hut be do here even
as i said it the door of the hut open and there limp out of it a
white man cloth in skin and with an enorm black beard i
thought that i must have got a touch of the sun it wa imposs no
hunter ever came to such a place as thi certainli no hunter would
ever settl in it i stare and stare and so did the other man and
just at that junctur sir henri and good walk up
look here you fellow i said is that a white man or am i mad
sir henri look and good look and then all of a sudden the lame
white man with a black beard utter a great cry and began hobbl
toward us when he wa close he fell down in a sort of faint
with a spring sir henri wa by hi side
great power he cri it is my brother georg
at the sound of thi disturb anoth figur also clad in skin
emerg from the hut a gun in hi hand and ran toward us on see
me he too gave a cry
macumazahn he hallo dont you know me baa im jim the hunter
i lost the note you gave me to give to the baa and we have been here
nearli two year and the fellow fell at my feet and roll over and
over weep for joi
you careless scoundrel i said you ought to be well
sjambockedthat is hide
meanwhil the man with the black beard had recov and risen and he
and sir henri were pumphandl awai at each other appar without
a word to sai but whatev thei had quarrel about in the pasti
suspect it wa a ladi though i never askedit wa evid forgotten
now
my dear old fellow burst out sir henri at last i thought you were
dead i have been over solomon mountain to find you i had given up
all hope of ever see you again and now i come across you perch in
the desert like an old assvgel1
i tri to cross solomon mountain nearli two year ago wa the
answer spoken in the hesit voic of a man who ha had littl
recent opportun of us hi tongu but when i reach here a
boulder fell on my leg and crush it and i have been abl to go
neither forward nor back
then i came up how do you do mr nevil i said do you rememb
me
why he said isnt it hunter quatermain eh and good too hold on
a minut you fellow i am get dizzi again it is all so veri
strang and when a man ha ceas to hope so veri happi
that even over the camp fire georg curti told us hi stori
which in it wai wa almost as event as our own and put shortli
amount to thi a littl less than two year befor he had start
from sitanda kraal to try to reach suliman berg as for the note i
had sent him by jim that worthi lost it and he had never heard of it
till todai but act upon inform he had receiv from the
nativ he head not for sheba breast but for the ladderlik
descent of the mountain down which we had just come which is clearli
a better rout than that mark out in old dom silvestra plan in the
desert he and jim had suffer great hardship but final thei
reach thi oasi where a terribl accid befel georg curti on
the dai of their arriv he wa sit by the stream and jim wa
extract the honei from the nest of a stingless bee which is to be
found in the desert on the top of a bank immedi abov him in so
do he loosen a great boulder of rock which fell upon georg
curtiss right leg crush it frightfulli from that dai he had been
so lame that he found it imposs to go either forward or back and
had prefer to take the chanc of dy in the oasi to the
certainti of perish in the desert
as for food howev thei got on pretti well for thei had a good
suppli of ammunit and the oasi wa frequent especi at
night by larg quantiti of game which came thither for water these
thei shot or trap in pitfal us the flesh for food and after
their cloth wore out the hide for cloth
and so georg curti end we have live for nearli two year
like a second robinson cruso and hi man fridai hope against hope
that some nativ might come here to help us awai but none have come
onli last night we settl that jim should leav me and try to reach
sitanda kraal to get assist he wa to go tomorrow but i had
littl hope of ever see him back again and now you of all peopl
in the world you who as i fanci had long ago forgotten all
about me and were live comfort in old england turn up in a
promiscu wai and find me where you least expect it is the most
wonder thing that i have ever heard of and the most merci too
then sir henri set to work and told him the main fact of our
adventur sit till late into the night to do it
by jove said georg curti when i show him some of the diamond
well at least you have got someth for your pain besid my
worthless self
sir henri laugh thei belong to quatermain and good it wa a part
of the bargain that thei should divid ani spoil there might be
thi remark set me think and have spoken to good i told sir
henri that it wa our joint wish that he should take a third portion of
the diamond or if he would not that hi share should be hand to
hi brother who had suffer even more than ourselv on the chanc of
get them final we prevail upon him to consent to thi
arrang but georg curti did not know of it until some time
afterward
here at thi point i think that i shall end my histori our journei
across the desert back to sitanda kraal wa most arduou especi
as we had to support georg curti whose right leg wa veri weak
inde and continu threw out splinter of bone but we did
accomplish it somehow and to give it detail would onli be to
reproduc much of what happen to us on the former occas
six month from the date of our rearriv at sitanda where we found
our gun and other good quit safe though the old rascal in charg
wa much disgust at our surviv to claim them saw us all onc more
safe and sound at my littl place on the berea near durban where i am
now write thenc i bid farewel to all who have accompani me
through the strangest trip i ever made in the cours of a long and
vari experi
psjust as i had written the last word a kafir came up my avenu of
orang tree carri a letter in a cleft stick which he had brought
from the post it turn out to be from sir henri and as it speak for
itself i give it in full

braylei hall yorkshir
my dear quatermain
i send you a line a few mail back to sai that the three of us
georg good and myself fetch up all right in england we got
off the boat at southampton and went up to town you should have
seen what a swell good turn out the veri next dai beautifulli
shave frock coat fit like a glove brand new eyeglass
etc etc i went and walk in the park with him where i met
some peopl i know and at onc told them the stori of hi
beauti white leg
he is furiou especi as some illnatur person ha print
it in a societi paper
to come to busi good and i took the diamond to streeter to
be valu as we arrang and realli i am afraid to tell you what
thei put them at it seem so enorm thei sai that of cours it
is more or less guesswork as such stone have never to their
knowledg been put on the market in anyth like such quantiti
it appear that with the except of on or two of the largest
thei ar of the finest water and equal in everi wai to the best
brazilian stone i ask them if thei would bui them but thei
said that it wa beyond their power to do so and recommend us
to sell by degre over a period of year inde for fear lest
we should flood the market thei offer howev a hundr and
eighti thousand for a veri small portion of them
you must come home quatermain and see about these thing
especi if you insist upon make the magnific present of
the third share which doe not belong to me to my brother
