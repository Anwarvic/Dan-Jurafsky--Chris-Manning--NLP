dai and therefor like the other mother of gentl rank whose children
saw the light upon that dai my mother receiv pharaoh gift and i
receiv the titl of royal twin in ra never did i set ey upon the
divin princ seti until the thirtieth birthdai of both of us all of
which happen thu
in those dai the great pharaoh rames the second and after him hi
son meneptah who succeed when he wa alreadi old sinc the mighti
rames wa taken to osiri after he had count on hundr rise of
the nile dwelt for the most part at the citi of tani in the desert
wherea i dwelt with my parent at the ancient whitewal citi of
memphi on the nile at time meneptah and hi court visit memphi as
also thei visit thebe where thi king li in hi royal tomb todai
but save on on occas the young princ seti the heirappar the
hope of egypt came not with them becaus hi mother asnefert did not
favour memphi where some troubl had befallen her in youththei
sai it wa a love matter that cost the lover hi life and her a sore
heartand seti stai with hi mother who would not suffer him out of
sight of her ey
onc he came inde when he wa fifteen year of ag to be proclaim
to the peopl as son of hi father as son of the sun as the futur
wearer of the doubl crown and then we hi twin in rather were
nineteen of us who were gentli bornwer call by name to meet him
and to kiss hi royal feet i made readi to go in a fine new robe
embroid in purpl with the name of seti and my own but on that veri
morn by the gift of some evil god i wa smitten with spot all
over my face and bodi a common sick that affect the young so it
happen that i did not see the princ for befor i wa well again he
had left memphi
now my father meri wa a scribe of the great templ of ptah and i wa
brought up to hi trade in the school of the templ where i copi
mani roll and also wrote out book of the dead which i adorn with
paint inde in thi busi i becam so clever that after my
father went blind some year befor hi death i earn enough to keep
him and my sister also until thei marri mother i had none for she
wa gather to osiri while i wa still veri littl so life went on
from year to year but in my heart i hate my lot while i wa still a
boi there rose up in me a desirenot to copi what other had written
but to write what other should copi i becam a dreamer of dream
walk at night beneath the palmtre upon the bank of the nile i
watch the moon shine upon the water and in it rai i seem to
see mani beauti thing pictur appear there which were differ
from ani that i saw in the world of men although in them were men and
women and even god
of these pictur i made stori in my heart and at last although that
wa not for some year i began to write these stori down in my spare
hour my sister found me do so and told my father who scold me
for such foolish which he said would never furnish me with bread
and beer but still i wrote on in secret by the light of the lamp in my
chamber at night then my sister marri and on dai my father di
suddenli while he wa recit prayer in the templ i caus him to be
embalm in the best fashion and buri with honour in the tomb he had
made readi for himself although to pai the cost i wa oblig to copi
book of the dead for nearli two year work so hard that i found no
time for the write of stori
when at length i wa free from debt i met a maiden from thebe with a
beauti face that alwai seem to smile and she took my heart from
my breast into her own in the end after i return from fight in
the war against the nine bow barbarian to which i wa summon like
other men i marri her as for her name let it be i will not think
of it even to myself we had on child a littl girl which di within
two year of her birth and then i learn what sorrow can mean to
man at first my wife wa sad but her grief depart with time and she
smile again as she us to do onli she said that she would bear no
more children for the god to take have littl to do she began to go
about the citi and make friend whom i did not know for of these be
a beauti woman she found mani the end of it wa that she depart
back to thebe with a soldier whom i had never seen for i wa alwai
work at home think of the babe who wa dead and how happi is a
bird that no man can snare though sometim of it own will it fli
in at hi windowplac
it wa after thi that my hair went white befor i had count thirti
year
now as i had none to work for and my want were few and simpl i found
more time for the write of stori which for the most part were
somewhat sad on of these stori a fellow scribe borrow from me and
read aloud to a compani whom it pleas so much that there were mani
who ask leav to copi it and publish it abroad so by degre i becam
known as a teller of tale which tale i caus to be copi and sold
though out of them i made but littl still my fame grew till on a dai
i receiv a messag from the princ seti my twin in ra sai that he
had read certain of my write which pleas him much and that it wa
hi wish to look upon my face i thank him humbl by the messeng and
answer that i would travel to tani and wait upon hi high first
howev i finish the longest stori which i had yet written it wa
call the tale of two brother and told how the faithless wife of on
of them brought troubl on the other so that he wa kill of how
also the just god brought him to life again and mani other matter
thi stori i dedic to hi high the princ seti and with it in
the bosom of my robe i travel to tani have hidden about me a sum
of gold that i had save
so i came to tani at the begin of winter and walk to the palac
of the princ boldli demand an audienc but now my troubl began
for the guard and watchmen thrust me from the door in the end i
bribe them and wa admit to the antechamb where were merchant
juggler dancingwomen offic and mani other all of them it
seem wait to see the princ folk who have noth to do
pleas themselv by make mock of me a stranger when i had mix
with them for sever dai i gain their friendship by tell to them
on of my stori after which i wa alwai welcom among them still
i could come no nearer to the princ and as my store of monei wa
begin to run low i bethought me that i would return to memphi
on dai howev a longbeard old man with a goldtip wand of
offic who had a bull head embroid on hi robe stop in front
of me and call me a whitehead crow ask me what i wa do
hop dai by dai about the chamber of the palac i told him my name
and busi and he told me hi which it seem wa pambasa on of
the princ chamberlain when i ask him to take me to the princ
he laugh in my face and said darkli that the road to hi highnesss
presenc wa pave with gold i understood what he meant and gave him a
gift which he took as readili as a cock pick corn sai that he would
speak of me to hi master and that i must come back again
i came thrice and each time that old cock pick more corn at last i
grew enrag and forget where i wa began to shout at him and
call him a thief so that folk gather round to listen thi seem
to frighten him at first he look toward the door as though to summon
the guard to thrust me out then chang hi mind and in a grumbl
voic bade me follow him we went down long passag past soldier who
stood at watch in them still as mummi in their coffin till at length
we came to some broider curtain here pambasa whisper to me to
wait and pass through the curtain which he left not quit close so
that i could see the room beyond and hear all that took place there
it wa a small room like to that of ani scribe for on the tabl were
palett pen of reed ink in alabast vase and sheet of papyru
pin upon board the wall were paint not as i wa wont to paint
the book of the dead but after the fashion of an earlier time such as
i have seen in certain ancient tomb with pictur of wild fowl rise
from the swamp and of tree and plant as thei grow against the wall
hung rack in which were papyru roll and on the hearth burn a fire
of cedarwood
by thi fire stood the princ whom i knew from hi statu hi year
appear fewer than mine although we were born upon the same dai and he
wa tall and thin veri fair also for on of our peopl perhap becaus
of the syrian blood that ran in hi vein hi hair wa straight and
brown like to that of northern folk who come to trade in the market of
egypt and hi ey were grei rather than black set beneath somewhat
promin brow such as those of hi father meneptah hi face wa
sweet as a woman but made curiou by certain wrinkl which ran from
the corner of the ey toward the ear i think that these came
from the bend of the brow in thought but other sai that thei were
inherit from an ancestress on the femal side bakenkhonsu my friend
the old prophet who serv under the first seti and di but the other
dai have live a hundr and twenti year told me that he knew her
befor she wa marri and that she and her descend seti might
have been twin
in hi hand the princ held an open roll a veri ancient write as i
who am skill in such matter that have to do with my trade knew from
it appear lift hi ey suddenli from the studi of thi roll
he saw the chamberlain stand befor him
you came at a good time pambasa he said in a voic that wa veri
soft and pleasant and yet most manlik you ar old and doubtless
wise sai ar you wise pambasa
ye your high i am wise like your highnesss uncl khaemua the
mighti magician whose sandal i us to clean when i wa young
is it so then why ar you so care to hide your wisdom which should
be open like a flower for us poor bee to suck at well i am glad to
learn that you ar wise for in thi book of magic that i have been
read i find problem worthi of khaemua the depart whom i onli
rememb as a brood blackbrow man much like my cousin amenmes
hi sonsav that no on can call amenmes wise
why is your high glad
becaus you be by your own account hi equal can now interpret the
matter as khaemua would have done you know pambasa that had he live
he would have been pharaoh in place of my father he di too soon
howev which prove to me that there wa someth in thi tale of
hi wisdom sinc no realli wise man would ever wish to be pharaoh of
egypt
pambasa stare with hi mouth open
not wish to be pharaoh he began
now pambasa the wise went on the princ as though he had not heard
him listen thi old book give a charm to empti the heart of it
weari that it sai is the oldest and most common sick in the
world from which onli kitten some children and mad peopl ar free
it appear that the cure for thi sick so sai the book is to
stand on the top of the pyramid of khufu at midnight at that moment when
the moon is largest in the whole year and drink from the cup of dream
recit meanwhil a spell written here at length in languag which i
cannot read
there is no virtu in spell princ if anyon can read them
and no us it would seem if thei can be read by none
moreov how can ani on climb the pyramid of khufu which is cover
with polish marbl even in the dai let alon at midnight your
high and there drink of the cup of dream
i do not know pambasa all i know is that i weari of thi foolish
and of the world tell me of someth that will lighten my heart for
it is heavi
there ar juggler without princ on of whom sai he can throw a
rope into the air and climb up it until he vanish into heaven
when he ha done it in your sight pambasa bring him to me but
not befor death is the onli rope by which we climb to heavenor be
lower into hell for rememb there is a god call set after whom
like my greatgrandfath i am name by the wayth priest alon know
whya well as on call osiri
then there ar the dancer princ and among them some veri fine
made girl for i saw them bath in the palac lake such as would
have delight the heart of your grandfath the great rames
thei do not delight my heart who want no nake women pranc here try
again pambasa
i can think of noth els princ yet stai there is a scribe
without name ana a thin sharpnos man who sai he is your
highnesss twin in ra
ana said the princ he of memphi who write stori why did you
not sai so befor you old fool let him enter at onc at onc
now hear thi i ana walk through the curtain and prostrat
myself sai
i am that scribe o royal son of the sun
how dare you enter the princ presenc without be bidden
began pambasa but seti broke in with a stern voic sai
and how dare you pambasa keep thi learn man wait at my door
like a dog rise ana and ceas from give me titl for we ar not
at court tell me how long have you been in tani
mani dai o princ i answer seek your presenc and in vain

the doorkeep
i understand said seti the doorkeep pambasa you will ascertain
what amount thi learn scribe ha disburs to the doorkeep and
refund him doubl begon now and see to the matter
so pambasa went cast a piteou look at me out of the corner of hi
ey
tell me said seti when he wa gone you who must be wise in your
fashion why doe a court alwai breed thiev
i suppos for the same reason o princ that a dog back breed
flea flea must live and there is the dog

ever i have power i will see to it thei shall be fewer but better fed
now ana be seat i know you though you do not know me and alreadi i
have learn to love you through your write tell me of yourself
so i told him all my simpl tale to which he listen without a word
and then ask me why i had come to see him i repli that it wa
becaus he had sent for me which he had forgotten also becaus i
brought him a stori that i had dare to dedic to him then i laid the
roll befor him on the tabl
i am honour he said in a pleas voic i am greatli honour
if i like it well your stori shall go to the tomb with me for my ka
to read and reread until the dai of resurrect though first i will
studi it in the flesh do you know thi citi of tani ana
i answer that i knew littl of it who had spent my time here haunt
the door of hi high
then with your leav i will be your guid through it thi night and
afterward we will sup and talk
i bow and he clap hi hand whereon a servant appear not
pambasa but anoth
bring two cloak said the princ i go abroad with the scribe ana
let a guard of four nubian no more follow us but at a distanc and
disguis let them wait at the privat entranc
the man bow and depart swiftli
almost immedi a black slave appear with two long hood cloak
such as cameldriv wear which he help us to put on then take
a lamp he led us from the room through a doorwai opposit to that by
which i had enter down passag and a narrow stair that end in a
courtyard cross thi we came to a wall great and thick in which
were doubl door sheath with copper that open mysteri at our
approach outsid of these door stood four tall men also wrap in
cloak who seem to take no note of us still look back when we
had gone a littl wai i observ that thei were follow us as though
by chanc
how fine a thing thought i to myself it is to be a princ who by
lift a finger can thu command servic at ani moment of the dai or
night
just at that moment seti said to me
see ana how sad a thing it is to be a princ who cannot even stir
abroad without notic to hi household and command the servic of a
secret guard to spy upon hi everi action and doubtless to make report
thereof to the polic of pharaoh
there ar two face to everyth thought i to myself again
chapter ii
the break of the cup
we walk down a broad street border by tree beyond which were
limewash flatroof hous built of sundri brick stand
each of them in it own garden till at length we came to the great
marketplac just as the full moon rose abov the palmtre make the
world almost as light as dai tani or rames as it is also call

now that the court ha left it i hear it is much desert about thi
marketplac stood great templ of the god with pylon and avenu
of sphinx also that wonder of the world the coloss statu of the
second rames while to the north upon a mound wa the gloriou palac

those templ of amon and ptah have been rebuilt in the time of my
grandfath or sinc hi dai by the labour of israelitish slave who

now and again the crowd would part to let pass the chariot of some nobl
or ladi befor which went run footmen who shout make wai make
wai and laid about them with their long wand then came a process
of whiterob priest of isi travel by moonlight as wa fit
for the servant of the ladi of the moon and bear aloft the holi
imag of the goddess befor which all men bow and for a littl while
were silent after thi follow the corps of some great on newli

for the strike of on of royal blood by chanc under which law it is
law for you to kill an israelit without trial befor the appoint
offic of pharaoh
i am not learn i do not know the law o princ all that thi woman
said is fals
at least it is not fals that yonder man li dead and that you slew
him as you yourself admit learn now and let all egypt learn that
even an israelit mai not be murder for no offenc save that of
weari and of pai back unearn blow with blow your blood shall
answer for hi blood soldier strike off hi head
the nubian leapt upon him and when i look again khuaka headless
corps lai by the corps of the hebrew nathan and their blood wa
mingl upon the step of the templ
the busi of the court is finish said the princ offic see
that thi woman is escort to her own peopl and with her the bodi of
her father for burial see too upon your live that no insult or harm
is done to her scribe ana accompani me henc to my hous where i would
speak with you let guard preced and follow me
he rose and all the peopl bow as he turn to go the ladi merapi
step forward and fall upon her knee said
o most just princ now and ever i am your servant
then we set out and as we left the marketplac on our wai to the
palac of the princ i heard a tumult of voic behind us some in
prais and some in blame of what had been done we walk on in silenc
broken onli by the measur tramp of the guard present the moon
pass behind a cloud and the world wa dark then from the edg of the
cloud sprang out a rai of light that lai straight and narrow abov us on
the heaven seti studi it a while and said
tell me o ana of what doe that moonbeam put you in mind
of a sword o princ i answer stretch out over egypt and held
in the black hand of some mighti god or spirit see there is the blade
from which fall littl cloud like drop of blood there is the hilt of
gold and look there beneath is the face of the god fire stream from
hi eyebrow and hi brow is black and aw i am afraid though what i
fear i know not
you have a poet mind ana still what you see i see and of thi i
am sure that some sword of vengeanc is inde stretch out over
egypt becaus of it evil do whereof thi light mai be the symbol
behold it seem to fall upon the templ of the god and the palac of
pharaoh and to cleav them now it is gone and the night is as night
were from the begin of the world come to my chamber and let us eat
i am weari i need food and wine as you must after struggl with that
lust murder whom i have sent to hi own place
the guard salut and were dismiss we mount to the princ
privat chamber in on of which hi servant clad me in fine linen
robe after a skill physician of the household had doctor the
bruis upon my thigh over which he ti a bandag spread with balm
then i wa led to a small dininghal where i found the princ wait
for me as though i were some honour guest and not a poor scribe who
had wonder henc from memphi with my ware he caus me to sit down
at hi right hand and even drew up the chair for me himself whereat i
felt abash to thi dai i rememb that leathers chair the arm
of it end in ivori sphinx and on it back of black wood in an oval
wa inlaid the name of the great rames to whom inde it had onc
belong dish were hand to usonli two of them and those quit
simpl for seti wa no great eaterbi a young nubian slave of a
veri merri face and with them wine more delici than ani i had ever
tast
we at and drank and the princ talk to me of my busi as a scribe
and of the make of tale which seem to interest him veri much
inde on might have thought that he wa a pupil in the school and i
the teacher so humbl and with such care did he weigh everyth that i
said about my art of matter of state or of the dread scene of blood
through which we had just pass he spoke no word at the end howev
after a littl paus dure which he held up a cup of alabast as thin
as an eggshel studi the light plai through it on the rich red
wine within he said to me
friend ana we have pass a stir hour togeth the first perhap
of mani or mayhap the last also we were born upon the same dai
and therefor unless the astrolog lie as do other menand
womenbeneath the same star lastli if i mai sai it i like you well
though i know not how you like me and when you ar in the room with me
i feel at eas which is strang for i know of no other with whom it is
so
now by a chanc onli thi morn i found in some old record which i
wa studi that the heir to the throne of egypt a thousand year ago
had and therefor as noth ever chang in egypt still ha a right
to a privat librarian for which the state that is the toiler of the
land must pai as in the end thei pai for all some dynasti have gone
by it seem sinc there wa such a librarian i think becaus most of
the heir to the throne could not or did not read also by chanc i
mention the matter to the vizier nehesi who grudg me everi ounc of
gold i spend as though it were on taken out of hi own pouch which
perhap it is he answer with that crook smile of hi
sinc i know well princ that there is no scribe in egypt whom you
would suffer about you for a singl month i will set the cost of a
librarian at the figur at which it stood in the eleventh dynasti upon
the roll of your highnesss household and defrai it from the royal
treasuri until he is discharg
therefor scribe ana i offer you thi post for on month that is
all for which i can promis you will be paid whatev it mai be for i
forget the sum
i thank you o princ i exclaim
do not thank me inde if you ar wise you will refus you have met
pambasa well nehesi is pambasa multipli by ten a rogu a thief a
bulli and on who ha pharaoh ear he will make your life a torment
to you and clip everi ring of gold that at length you wring out of
hi grip moreov the place is wearisom and i am fanci and often
illhumour do not thank me i sai refus return to memphi and
write stori shun court and their plot pharaoh himself is but a
face and a puppet through which other voic talk and other ey shine
and the sceptr which he wield is pull by string and if thi is so
with pharaoh what is the case with hi son then there ar the women
ana thei will make love to you ana thei even do so to me and i think
you told me that you know someth of women do not accept go back
to memphi i will send you some old manuscript to copi and pai you
whatev it is nehesi allow for the librarian
yet i accept o princ as for nehesi i fear him not at all sinc at
the worst i can write a stori about him at which the world will laugh
and rather than that he will pai me my salari
you have more wisdom than i thought ana it never came into my mind to
put nehesi in a stori though it is true i tell tale about him which is
much the same thing
he bend forward lean hi head upon hi hand and ceas from hi
banter tone look me in the ey and ask
why do you accept let me think now it is not becaus you care for
wealth if that is to be won here nor for the pomp and show of court
nor for the compani of the great who realli ar so small for all these
thing you ana have no crave if i read your heart aright you who
ar an artist noth less and noth more tell me then why will
you a free man who can earn your live linger round a throne and
set your neck beneath the heel of princ to be crush into the common
mould of servitor and king companion and bearer of the footstool
i will tell you princ first becaus throne make histori as
histori make throne and i think that great event ar on foot in
egypt in which i would have my share secondli becaus the god bring
gift to men onli onc or twice in their live and to refus them is
to offend the god who gave them those live to us to end of which we
know noth and thirdlyher i hesit
and thirdlyout with the thirdli for doubtless it is the real
reason
and thirdli o princewel the word sound strang upon a man
lipsbut thirdli becaus i love you from the moment that my ey fell
upon your face i love you as i never love ani other mannot even my
father i know not why certainli it is not becaus you ar a princ
when he heard these word seti sat brood and so silent that fear
lest i a humbl scribe had been too bold i ad hastili
let your high pardon hi servant for hi presumptu word it wa
hi servant heart that spoke and not hi lip
he lift hi hand and i stop
ana my twin in ra he said do you know that i never had a friend
a princ who ha no friend
never none now i begin to think that i have found on the thought is
strang and warm me do you know also that when my ey fell upon your
face i love you also the god know why it wa as though i had found
on who wa dear to me thousand of year ago but whom i had lost and
forgotten perhap thi is but foolish or perhap here we have the
shadow of someth great and beauti which dwell elsewher in the
place we call the kingdom of osiri beyond the grave ana
such thought have come to me at time princ i mean that all we see
is shadow that we ourselv ar shadow and that the realiti who cast
them live in a differ home which is lit by some spirit sun that never
set
the princ nod hi head and again wa silent for a while then he
took hi beauti alabast cup and pour wine into it he drank a
littl and pass the cup to me
drink also ana he said and pledg me as i pledg you in token
that by decre of the creator who made the heart of men henceforward
our two heart ar as the same heart through good and ill through
triumph and defeat till death take on of us henceforward ana
unless you show yourself unworthi i hide no thought from you
flush with joi i took the cup sai
i add to your word o princ we ar on not for thi life alon but
for all the live to be death o princ is i think but a singl step
in the pylon stair which lead at last to that dizzi height whenc we
see the face of god and hear hi voic tell us what and why we ar
then i pledg him and drank bow and he bow back to me
what shall we do with the cup ana the sacr cup that ha held thi
rich heartwin shall i keep it no it no longer belong to me shall
i give it to you no it can never be your alon see we will break
the priceless thing
seiz it by it stem with all hi strength he struck the cup upon the
tabl then what seem to be to me a marvel happen for instead of
shatter as i thought it sure would it split in two from rim to
foot whether thi wa by chanc or whether the artist who fashion
it in some bygon gener had work the two halv separ and
cunningli cement them togeth to thi hour i do not know at least
so it befel
thi is fortun ana said the princ laugh a littl in hi
light wai now take you the half that li nearest to you and i will
take mine if you die first i will lai my half upon your breast and
if i die first you shall do the same by me or if the priest forbid it
becaus i am royal and mai not be profan cast the thing into my tomb
what should we have done had the alabast shatter into fragment
ana and what omen should we have read in them
why ask o princ see that it ha befallen otherwis
then i took my half laid it against my forehead and hid it in the bosom
of my robe and as i did so did seti
so in thi strang fashion the royal seti and i seal the holi compact
of our brotherhood as i think not for the first time or the last
chapter iii
userti
seti rose stretch out hi arm
that is finish he said as everyth finish and for onc i am
sorri now what next sleep i suppos in which all end or perhap
you would sai all begin

the chamberlain stare at the wine flask on the tabl as though he

pambasa went and present through the curtain appear a royallook
ladi splendidli apparel she wa accompani by four wait women
who fell back on the threshold and were no more seen the princ step
forward took both her hand in hi and kiss her on the brow then
drew back again after which thei stood a moment look at each other
while thei remain thu i studi her who wa known throughout the land
as the beauti royal daughter but whom till now i had never seen
in truth i did not think her beauti although even had she been clad
in a peasant robe i should have been sure that she wa royal her
face wa too hard for beauti and her black ey with a ting of grei in
them were too small also her nose wa too sharp and her lip were
too thin inde had it not been for the delic and finelyshap
woman form beneath i might have thought that a princ and not a
princess stood befor me for the rest in most wai she resembl her
halfbroth seti though her counten lack the kindli of hi
or rather both of them resembl their father meneptah
greet sister he said ey her with a smile in which i caught a
gleam of mockeri purplebord robe emerald necklac and enamel
crown of gold ring and pector everyth except a sceptrewhi ar
you so royal arrai to visit on so humbl as your love brother
you come like sunlight into the dark of the hermit cell and dazzl
the poor hermit or rather hermit and he point to me
ceas your jest seti she repli in a full strong voic i wear
these ornament becaus thei pleas me also i have sup with our
father and those who sit at pharaoh tabl must be suitabl arrai
though i have note that sometim you think otherwis
inde i trust that the good god our divin parent is well tonight
as you leav him so earli
i leav him becaus he sent me with a messag to you she paus
look at me sharpli then ask who is that man i do not know him
it is your misfortun userti but on which can be mend he is name
ana the scribe who write strang stori of great interest which you
would do well to read who dwell too much upon the outsid of life he
is from memphi and hi father name wasi forget what ana what wa
your father name
on too humbl for royal ear princ i answer but my grandfath
wa pentaur the poet who wrote of the deed of the mighti rames
is it so why did you not tell me that befor the descent should earn
you a pension from the court if you can extract it from nehesi well
userti hi grandfath name wa pentaur whose immort vers you
have doubtless read upon templ wall where our grandfath wa care
to publish them
i haveto my sorrowand thought them poor boast stuff she
answer coldli
to be honest if ana will forgiv me so do i i can assur you that
hi stori ar a great improv on them friend ana thi is my
sister userti my father daughter though our mother were not the
same
i prai you seti to be so good as to give me my right titl in
speak of me to scribe and other of your servant

heiress the princess of the two land the highpriestess of amon
the cherish of the god the halfsist of the heirappar the

whose queen will you be have you made up your mind for myself i know
no on worthi of so much beauti excel learn andwhat shall i
addsweet ye sweet
seti she said stamp her foot if it pleas you to make a mock
of me befor a stranger i suppos that i must submit send him awai i
would speak with you
make a mock of you oh mine is a hard fate when truth gush from the
well of my heart i am told i mock and when i mock all sayh speak
truth be seat sister and talk on freeli thi ana is my sworn
friend who save my life but now for which deed perhap he should be
my enemi hi memori is excel also and he will rememb what you sai

your leav i will ask him to stai here
my princ i broke in i prai you suffer me to go
my secretari he answer with a note of command in hi voic i prai
you to remain where you ar
so i sat myself on the ground after the fashion of a scribe have no
choic and the princess sat herself on a couch at the end of the tabl
but seti remain stand then the princess said
sinc it is your will brother that i should talk secret into
other ear than your i obei you stillher she look at me
wrathfullylet the tongu be care that it doe not repeat what
the ear have heard lest there should be neither ear nor tongu my
brother it ha been report to pharaoh while we at togeth that
there is tumult in thi town it ha been report to him that becaus
of a troubl about some base israelit you caus on of hi offic to
be behead after which there came a riot which still rage
strang that truth should have come to the ear of pharaoh so quickli
now my sister if he had heard it three moon henc i could have
believ youalmost
then you did behead the offic
ye i behead him about two hour ago
pharaoh will demand an account of the matter
pharaoh answer seti lift hi ey ha no power to question the
justic of the governor of tani in the north
you ar in error seti pharaoh ha all power
nai sister pharaoh is but on man among million of other men and
though he speak it is their spirit which bend hi tongu while abov
that spirit is a great greater spirit who decre what thei shall think
to end of which we know noth
i do not understand seti
i never thought you would userti but when you have leisur ask ana
here to explain the matter to you i am sure that he understand
oh i have born enough exclaim userti rise hearken to the
command of pharaoh princ seti it is that you wait upon him tomorrow
in full council at an hour befor noon there to talk with him of thi
question of the israelitish slave and the offic whom it ha pleas
you to kill i came to speak other word to you also but as thei
were for your privat ear these can bide a more fit opportun
farewel my brother
what ar you go so soon sister i wish to tell you the stori
about those israelit and especi of the maid whose name iswhat
wa her name ana
merapi moon of israel princ i ad with a groan
about the maid call merapi moon of israel i think the sweetest that
ever i have look upon whose father the dead captain murder in my
sight
so there is a woman in the busi well i guess it
in what busi is there not a woman userti even in that of a
messag from pharaoh pambasa pambasa escort the princess and
summon her servant women everyon of them unless my sens mock
me goodnight to you o sister and ladi of the two land and forgiv
methat coronet of your is somewhat awri
at last she wa gone and i rose wipe my brow with a corner of my
robe and look at the princ who stood befor the fire laugh
softli
make a note of all thi talk ana he said there is more in it than
meet the ear
i need no note princ i answer everi word is burnt upon my mind
as a hot iron burn a tablet of wood with reason too sinc now her
high will hate me for all her life
much better so ana than that she should pretend to love you which
she never would have done while you ar my friend women oftim respect
those whom thei hate and even will advanc them becaus of polici but
let those whom thei pretend to love bewar the time mai come when you
will yet be userti most trust councillor
now here i ana the scribe will state that in after dai when thi
same queen wa the wife of pharaoh saptah i did as it chanc becom
her most trust councillor moreov in those time ye and even in
the hour of her death she swore from the moment her ey first fell
on me she had known me to be trueheart and held me in esteem as no
selfseek more i think she believ what she said have forgotten
that onc she look upon me as her enemi thi inde i never wa who
alwai held her in high regard and honour as a great ladi who love
her countri though on who sometim wa not wise but as i could not
forese these thing on that night of long ago i onli stare at the
princ and said
oh why did you not allow me to depart as your high said i might at
the begin soon or late my head will pai the price of thi night
work
then she must take mine with it listen ana i kept you here not to
vex the princess or you but for a good reason you know that it is the
custom of the royal dynasti of egypt for king or those who will
be king to wed their near kin in order that the blood mai remain the
purer
ye princ and not onli among those who ar royal still i think it
an evil custom
as i do sinc the race wherein it is practis grow ever weaker
in bodi and in mind which is why perhap my father is not what hi
father wa and i am not what my father is
also princ it is hard to mingl the love of the sister and of the
wife
veri hard ana so hard that when it is attempt both ar apt to
vanish well our mother have been true royal wive though her di
befor mine wa wed by my father pharaoh desir that i should
marri my halfsist userti and what is wors she desir it also
moreov the peopl who fear troubl ahead in egypt if we who alon
ar left of the true royal race born of queen remain apart and she
take anoth lord or i take anoth wife demand that it should be
brought about sinc thei believ that whoever call userti the strong
hi spous will on dai rule the land
why doe the princess wish itthat she mai be a queen
ye ana though were she to wed my cousin amenmes the son of
pharaoh elder brother khaemua she might still be a queen if i chose
to stand asid as i would not be loth to do
would egypt suffer thi princ
i do not know nor doe it matter sinc she hate amenmes who is
strongwil and ambiti and will have none of him also he is
alreadi marri
is there no other royal on whom she might take princ
none moreov she wish me alon
why princ
becaus of ancient custom which she worship also becaus she know
me well and in her fashion is fond of me whom she believ to be a
gentlemind dreamer that she can rule lastli becaus i am the law
heir to the crown and without me to share it she think that she would
never be safe upon the throne especi if i should marri some other
woman of whom she would be jealou it is the throne she desir and
would wed not the princ seti her halfbroth whom she take with it
to be in name her husband as pharaoh command that she should do
love plai no part in userti breast ana which make her the more
danger sinc what she seek with a cold heart of polici that she
will sure find
then it would seem princ that the cage is built about you after all
it is a veri splendid cage and made of gold
ye ana yet not on in which i would live still except by death how
can i escap from the threefold chain of the will of pharaoh of egypt
and of userti oh he went on in a new voic on that had in it both
sorrow and passion thi is a matter in which i would have chosen for
myself who in all other must be a servant and i mai not choos
is there perchanc some other ladi princ
none by hathor noneat least i think not yet i would have been free
to search for such a on and take her when i found her if she were but
a fishergirl
the king of egypt can have larg household princ
i know it ar there not still score whom i should call aunt and
uncl i think that my grandsir rames bless egypt with quit
three hundr children and in so do in a wai wa wise sinc thu
he might be sure that while the world endur in it will flow some the
blood that onc wa hi
yet in life or death how will that help him princ some must beget
the multitud of the earth what doe it matter who these mai have
been
noth at all ana sinc by good or evil fortun thei ar born
therefor why talk of larg household though like ani man who can
pai for it pharaoh mai have a larg household i seek a queen who shall
reign in my heart as well as on my throne not a larg household ana
oh i am weari pambasa come hither and conduct my secretari ana to
the empti room that is next to my own the paint chamber which look
toward the north and bid my slave attend to all hi want as thei
would to mine
why did you tell me you were a scribe my lord ana ask pambasa as
he led me to my beauti sleepingplac
becaus that is my trade chamberlain
he look at me shake hi great head till the long white beard wave
across hi breast like a templ banner in the faint even breez and
answer
you ar no scribe you ar a magician who can win the love and favour
of hi high in an hour which other cannot do between two rise
of the nile had you said so at onc you would have been differ
treat yonder in the hall of wait forgiv me therefor what i did
in ignor and my lord i prai it mai pleas you not to melt awai in
the night lest my feet should answer for it beneath the stick
it wa the fourth hour from sunris of the follow dai that for the
first time in my life i found myself in the court of pharaoh stand
with other member of hi household in the train of hi high the
princ seti it wa a veri great place for pharaoh sat in the judgment
hall whereof the roof is upheld by round and sculptur column
between which were set statu of pharaoh who had been save at
the throne end of the hall where the light flow down through
clerestori the vast chamber wa dim almost to dark at least so
it seem to me enter there out of the brilliant sunshin through
thi gloom mani folk move like shadow captain nobl and state
offic who had been summon to the court and among them whiterob
and shaven priest also there were other of whom i took no count such
as arab headmen from the desert trader with jewel and other ware to
sell farmer and even peasant with petit to present lawyer and
their client and i know not who besid through which of all these
none were suffer to advanc beyond a certain mark where the light
began to fall speak in whisper all of these folk flit to and fro
like bat in a tomb
we wait between two hathorhead pillar in on of the vestibul of
the hall the princ seti who wa clad in purplebroid garment and
wore upon hi brow a fillet of gold from which rose the uru or hood
snake also of gold that royal on alon might wear lean against
the base of a statu while the rest of us stood silent behind him
for a time he wa silent also as a man might be whose thought were
otherwher at length he turn and said to me
thi is weari work would i had ask you to bring that new tale of
your scribe ana that we might have read it togeth
shall i tell you the plot of it princ
ye i mean not now lest i should forget my manner listen to you
look and he point to a darkbrow fierceei man of middl ag
who pass up the hall as though he did not see us there goe my
cousin amenmes you know him do you not
i shook my head
then tell me what you think of him at onc befor the first judgment
fade
i think he is a royallook lord obstin in mind and strong in
bodi handsom too in hi wai
all can see that ana what els
i think i said in a low voic so that none might overhear that hi
heart is as black as hi brow that he ha grown wick with jealousi
and hate and will do you evil
can a man grow wick ana is he not as he wa born till the end i do
not know nor do you still you ar right he is jealou and will do me
evil if it bring him good but tell me which of us will triumph at the
last
while i hesit what to answer i becam awar that someon had join
us look round i perceiv a veri ancient man clad in a white robe
he wa broadfac and baldhead and hi ey burn beneath hi
shaggi eyebrow like two coal in ash he support himself on a staff
of cedarwood grip it with both hand that for thin were like
to those of a mummi for a while he consid us both as though he were
read our soul then said in a full and jovial voic
greet princ
seti turn look at him and answer
greet bakenkhonsu how come it that you ar still aliv when we
part at thebe i made sure
that on your return you would find me in my tomb not so princ it is
i who shall live to look upon you in your tomb ye and on other who
ar yet to sit in the seat of pharaoh why not ho ho why not see
that i am but a hundr and seven i who rememb the first rames and
have plai with hi grandson your grandsir as a boi why should i
not live princ to nurs your grandsonif the god should grant you
on who as yet have neither wife nor child
becaus you will get tire of life bakenkhonsu as i am alreadi and
the god will not be abl to spare you much longer
the god can endur yet a while without me princ when so mani ar
flock to their tabl inde it is their desir that on good priest
should be left in egypt ki the magician told me so onli thi morn
he had it straight from heaven in a dream last night
why have you been to visit ki ask seti look at him sharpli i
should have thought that be both of a trade you would have hate each
other
not so princ on the contrari we add up each other account i mean
check and interpret each other vision with which we ar both of us
much troubl just now is that young man a scribe from memphi
ye and my friend hi grandsir wa pentaur the poet
inde i knew pentaur well often ha he read me to sleep with hi
long poem rank stuff that grew like coars grass upon a deep but
halfdrain soil ar you sure young man that pentaur wa your
grandfath you ar not like him quit a differ kind of herbag
and you know that it is a matter upon which we must take a woman
word
seti burst out laugh and i look at the old priest angrili though
now that i came to think of it my father alwai said that hi mother wa
on of the biggest liar in egypt
well let it be went on bakenkhonsu till we find out the truth
befor thoth ki wa speak of you young man i did not pai much
attent to him but it wa someth about a sudden vow of friendship
between you and the princ here there wa a cup in the stori too an
alabast cup that seem familiar to me ki said it wa broken
seti start and i began angrili
what do you know of that cup where were you hid o priest
oh in your soul i suppos he answer dreamili or rather ki wa
but i know noth and am not curiou if you had broken the cup with
a woman now it would have been more interest even to an old man
be so good as to answer the princ question as to whether he or hi
cousin amenmes will triumph at the last for on that matter both ki
and i ar curiou

the two stood befor the throne and look at pharaoh make no
obeis pharaoh look at them and wa silent for a long space thei
stood thu in the midst of a great quiet but pharaoh would not speak
and none of hi offic seem to dare to open their mouth at length
the first of the prophet spoke in a clear cold voic as some conqueror
might do

should let hi peopl go to do sacrific to him in the wilder
who is jahveh i know not jahveh who serv amon and the god of egypt
and why should i let your peopl go
jahveh is the god of israel the great god of all god whose power you

then from the throng at the back of the hall came forward merapi clad
in a white robe and with a black veil thrown about her head in token
of mourn but not so as to hide her face up the hall she glide and
made obeis to pharaoh as she did so cast on swift look at seti
where he sat then she stood still look as i thought wonderfulli
beauti in that simpl robe of white and the evil of black

she obei tell all the tale in her low and honei voic nor did
ani seem to think it long or wearisom at length she end and pharaoh
said

perchanc you did right and perchanc you did wrong son seti at least
you ar the best judg and becaus he struck your royal person thi
khuaka deserv to die
again he wa silent for a while stare through the open door at the
sky beyond then he said
what would ye more prophet of jahveh justic ha been done upon my
offic who slew the man of your peopl a life ha been taken for a

then the curs of jahveh shall be on you pharaoh and with plagu upon
plagu shall he smite thi land of egypt
now a sudden rage seiz meneptah

rames onli no more straw shall be given to them for the make of the
brick becaus thei ar idl let them go forth and gather the straw
themselv let them gather it from the face of the field
there wa silenc for a while then with on voic both the prophet
spoke point with their wand to pharaoh
in the name of the lord god we curs you pharaoh who soon shall die
and make answer for thi sin the peopl of egypt we curs also ruin
shall be their portion death shall be their bread and blood shall thei
drink in a great dark moreov at the last pharaoh shall let the
peopl go
then wait no answer thei turn and strode awai side by side nor
did ani man hinder them in their go again there wa silenc in the
hall the silenc of fear for these were aw word that the prophet
had spoken pharaoh knew it for hi chin sank upon hi breast and hi
face that had been red with rage turn white userti hid her ey with
her hand as though to shut out some evil vision and even seti seem
ill at eas as though that aw curs had found a home within hi

at a motion of pharaoh hand the vizier nehesi struck the ground
thrice with hi wand of offic and point to the door thu give

make him a prophet sinc in a year to come she did marri him in
order that she might stai upon the throne at a time of troubl when
egypt would not suffer that a woman should have sole rule over the land
but pharaoh did not smile like the courtier inde he grew angri
peac saptah he said who ar you that wrangl befor me talk
of the death of king and sai that you will wed the royal princess
on more such word and you shall be driven into banish hearken
now almost am i mind to declar my daughter the royal princess sole
heiress to the throne see that in her there is more strength and
wisdom than in ani other of our hous
if such be pharaoh will let pharaoh will be done said seti most
humbl well i know my own unworthi to fill so high a station

she turn and answer with cold courtesi
then i crave your pardon and thank you for your kind thought for

minut is it from now till the fourth hour tomorrow morn when i
shall order my chariot to be readi also do you know whether it is
possibl to travel from goshen across the marsh and to return by
syria or fail that to travel across the desert to thebe and sail
down the nile in the spring
oh my princ my princ i said i prai you to dismiss me let me go
anywher out of the reach of her highnesss tongu
it is strang how alik we think upon everi matter ana even of merapi

go if it is a question of go there ar other who will go first
moreov you cannot go but must stai and bear your burden as i bear
mine rememb the broken cup ana
i rememb my princ but sooner would i be scourg with rod than by
such word as those to which i must listen
yet that veri night when i had left the princ i wa destin to hear
more pleasant word from thi same chang or perchanc polit
royal ladi she sent for me and i went much afraid i found her in a
small chamber alon save for on old ladi of honour who sat the end of
the room and appear to be deaf which perhap wa why she wa chosen
userti bade me be seat befor her veri courteous and spoke to me
thu whether becaus of some talk she had held with the princ or not
i do not know
scribe ana i ask your pardon if be vex and weari i said to
you and of you todai what i now wish i had left unsaid i know well
that you be of the gentl blood of egypt will make no report of
what you heard outsid these wall
mai my tongu be cut out first i answer
it seem scribe ana that my lord the princ ha taken a great love of
you how or why thi came about so suddenli you be a man i do not
understand but i am sure that as it is so it must be becaus there
is much in you to love sinc never did i know the princ to show deep
regard for on who wa not most honour and worthi now thing be
so it is plain that you will becom the favourit of hi high a
man who doe not chang hi mind in such matter and that he will
tell you all hi secret thought perhap some that he hide from the
councillor of state or even from me in short you will grow into
a power in the land and perhap on dai be the greatest in itaft
pharaohalthough you mai still seem to be but a privat scribe
i do not pretend to you that i should have wish thi to be so who
would rather that my husband had but on real councillormyself yet
see that it is so i bow my head hope that it mai be decre for
the best if ever ani jealousi should overcom me in thi matter and
i should speak sharpli to you as i did todai i ask your pardon in
advanc for that which ha not happen as i have ask it for that
which ha happen i prai of you scribe ana that you will do your
best to influenc the mind of the princ for good sinc he is easili
led by ani whom he love i prai you also be quick and thought
as i see you ar that you will make a studi of statecraft and of
the polici of our royal hous come to me if it be need for
instruct therein so that you mai be abl to guid the feet of the
princ aright should he turn to you for counsel
all of thi i will do your high if by ani chanc it li in my
power though who am i that i should hope to make a path for the feet of
king moreov i would add thi although he is so gentlenatur i
think that in the end the princ is on who will alwai choos hi own
path
it mai be so ana at the least i thank you i prai you to be sure also
that in me you will alwai have a friend and not an enemi although at
time the quick of my natur which ha never been control mai
lead you to think otherwis now i will sai on more thing that shall
be secret between us i know that the princ love me as a friend and
rel rather than as a wife and that he would not have sought thi
marriag of himself as is perhap natur i know too that other
women will come into hi life though these mai be fewer than in the
case of most king becaus he is more hard to pleas of such i cannot
complain as thi is accord to the custom of our countri i fear
onli on thingnam that some woman ceas to be hi toi mai take
seti heart and make him altogeth her in thi matter scribe ana
as in other i ask your help sinc i would be queen of egypt in all
wai not in name onli
your high how can i sai to the princeso much shall you love
thi or that woman and no more moreov why do you fear that which
ha not and mai never come about
i do not know how you can sai such a thing scribe still i ask you to
sai it if you can as to why i fear it is becaus i seem to feel the
near shadow of some woman ly cold upon me and build a wall of
black between hi high and myself
it is but a dream princess
mayhap i hope so yet i think otherwis oh ana cannot you who
studi the heart of men and women understand my case i have marri
where i can never hope to be love as other women ar i who am a wife
yet not a wife i read your thought it iswhi then did you marri
sinc i have told you so much i will tell you that also first it is
becaus the princ is differ to other men and in hi own fashion
abov them ye far abov ani with whom i could have wed as royal
heiress of egypt secondli becaus be cut off from love what
remain to me but ambit at least i would be a great queen as wa
hatshepu in her dai and lift my countri out of the mani troubl in
which it is sunk and write my name larg upon the book of histori
which i could onli do by take pharaoh heir to husband as is my
duti
she brood a while then ad now i have shown you all my thought
whether i have been wise to do so the god know alon and time will tell
me
princess i said i thank you for trust me and i will help you if
i mai yet i am troubl i a humbl man if of good blood who a
littl while ago wa but a scribe and a student a dreamer who had
known troubl also have suddenli by chanc or some divin decre been
lift high in the favour of the heir of egypt and it would seem have
even won your trust now i wonder how i shall bear myself in thi new
place which in truth i never sought
i do not know who find the present and it troubl enough to carri
but doubtless the decre of which you speak that set you there ha
also written down what will be the end of all meanwhil i have a gift
for you sai scribe have you ever handl ani weapon besid a pen
ye your high as a lad i wa skill in sword plai moreov
though i do not love war and bloodsh some year ago i fought in the
great battl between the ninebow barbarian when pharaoh call upon
the young men of memphi to do their part with my own hand i slew two
in fair fight though on nearli brought me to my end and i point
to a scar which show red through my grei hair where a spear had bitten
deep
it is well or so i think who love soldier better than stainer of
papyru pith
then go to a paint chest of reed she took from it a wonder
shirt of mail fashion of bronz ring and a short sword also of
bronz have a golden hilt of which the end wa shape to the like
of the head of a lion and with her own hand gave them to me sai
these ar spoil that my grandsir the great rames took in hi
youth from a princ of the khitah whom he smote with hi own hand in
syria in that battl whereof your grandfath made the poem wear the
shirt which no spear will pierc beneath your robe and gird the sword
about you when you go down yonder among the israelit whom i do not
trust i have given a like coat to the princ let it be your duti to
see that it is upon hi sacr person dai and night let it be your
duti also if need aris with thi sword to defend him to the death
farewel
mai all the god reject me from the field of the bless if i fail in
thi trust i answer and depart wonder to seek sleep which as
it chanc i wa not to find for a while
for as i went down the corridor led by on of the ladi of the
household whom should i find wait at the end of it but old pambasa
to inform me with mani bow that the princ need my presenc i ask
how that could be see he had dismiss me for the night he repli
that he did not know but he wa command to conduct me to the privat
chamber the same room in which i had first seen hi high thither i
went and found him warm himself at the fire for the night wa cold
look up he bade pambasa admit those who were wait then note the
shirt of mail and the sword i carri in my hand said
you have been with the princess have you not and she must have had
much to sai to you for your talk wa long well i think i can guess it
purport who from a child have known her mind she told you to watch me
well bodi and heart and all that come from the heartoh and much
els also she gave you that syrian gear to wear among the hebrew as
she ha given the like to me be of a care mind which forese
everyth now hearken ana i griev to keep you from your rest who
must be weari both with talk and travel but old bakenkhonsu whom you
know wait without and with him ki the great magician whom i think
you have not seen he is a man of wonder lore and in some wai not
altogeth human at least he doe strang feat of magic and at time
both the past and the futur seem to be open to hi sight though as we
know neither the on nor the other who can tell whether he read them
truli doubtless he ha or think he ha some messag to me from the
heaven which i thought you might wish to hear
i wish it much princ if i am worthi and you will protect me from
the anger of thi magician whom i fear
anger sometim turn to trust ana did you not find it so just now
in the case of her high as i told you might veri well happen hush
thei come be seat and prepar your tablet to make record of what
thei sai
the curtain were drawn and through them came the ag bakenkhonsu
lean upon hi staff and with him anoth man ki himself clad in a
white robe and have hi head shaven for he wa an hereditari priest
of amon of thebe and an initi of isi mother of mysteri also hi
offic wa that of kherheb or chief magician of egypt at first sight
there wa noth strang about thi man inde he might well have
been a middleag merchant by hi look in bodi he wa short and
stout in face fat and smile but in thi jovial counten were set
two veri strang ey greyhu rather than black while the rest of
the face seem to smile these ey look straight into nothing as
do those of a statu inde thei were like to the ey or rather the
eyeplac of a stone statu so deepli were thei set into the head for
my part i can onli sai i thought them aw and by their look judg
that whatev ki might be he wa no cheat
thi strang pair bow to the princ and seat themselv at a sign
from him bakenkhonsu upon a stool becaus he found it difficult to
rise and ki who wa younger scribe fashion on the ground
what did i tell you bakenkhonsu said ki in a full rich voic
end the word with a curiou chuckl
you told me magician that we should find the princ in thi chamber
of which you describ everi detail to me as i see it now although
neither of us have enter it befor you said also that seat therein
on the ground would be the scribe ana whom i know but you do not
have in hi hand waxen tablet and a stylu and by him a coat of
curiou mail and a lionhilt sword
that is strang interrupt the princ but forgiv me bakenkhonsu
see these thing if you o ki would tell us what is written upon
ana tablet which neither of you can see it would be stranger still
that is if anyth is written
ki smile and stare upward at the ceil present he said
the scribe ana us a shorthand of hi own that is not easi to
deciph yet i see written on the tablet the price he obtain for
some hous in a citi that is not namedit is so much also i see the
sum he disburs for himself a servant and the food of an ass at two
inn where he stop upon a journei thei ar so much and so much also
there is a list of papyru roll and the word blue cloak and then
an erasur
is that right ana ask the princ
quit right i answer with aw onli the word blue cloak which
it is true i wrote upon the tablet have also been eras
ki chuckl and turn hi ey from the ceil to my face
would your high wish me to tell you anyth of what is written
upon the tablet of thi scribe memori as well as upon those of wax
which he hold in hi hand thei ar easier to deciph than the other
and i see on them mani thing of interest for instanc secret word
that seem to have been said to him by some great on within an hour
matter of high polici i think for instanc a certain sai i think
of your highnesss as to shiver upon the edg of water on a cold
dai which when enter produc heat and the answer thereto for
instanc word that were spoken in thi palac when an alabast cup
wa broke by the wai scribe that wa a veri good place you chose in
which to hide on half of the cup in the fals bottom of a chest in your
chamber a chest that is fasten with a cord and seal with a scarab
of the time of the second rames i think that the other half of the
cup is somewhat nearer at hand and turn he stare at the wall
where i could see noth save slab of alabast
now i sat openmouth for how could thi man know these thing and
the princ laugh outright sai
ana i begin to think you keep your counsel ill at least i should
think so were it not that you have had no time to tell what the
princess yonder mai have said to you and can scarc know the trick of
the slide panel in that wall which i have never shown to you
ki chuckl again and a smile grew on old bakenkhonsu broad and
wrinkl face
o princ i began i swear to you that never ha on word pass my
lip of aught
i know it friend broke in the princ but it seem there ar some
who do not wait for word but can read the book of thought therefor it
is not well to meet them too often sinc all have thought that should
be known onli to them and god magician what is your busi with me
speak on as though we were alon
thi princ you go upon a journei among the hebrew as all have
heard now bakenkhonsu and i also two seer of my colleg see that
we all love you and that your welfar is much to egypt have separ
sought out the futur as regard the issu of thi journei although
what we have learn differ in some matter on other it is the same
therefor we thought it our duti to tell you what we have learn
sai on kherheb
first then that your highnesss life will be in danger
life is alwai in danger ki shall i lose it if so do not fear to
tell me
we do not know but we think not becaus of the rest that is reveal
to us we learn that it is not your bodi onli that will be in danger
upon thi journei you will see a woman whom you will come to love thi
woman will we think bring you much sorrow and also much joi
then perhap the journei is worth make ki sinc mani travel far
befor thei find aught thei can love tell me have i met thi woman
there we ar troubl princ for it would seemunless we ar
deceivedthat you have met her often and often that you have known
her for thousand of year as you have known that man at your side for
thousand of year
seti face grew veri interest
what do you mean magician he ask ey him keenli how can i
who am still young have known a woman and a man for thousand of year
ki consid him with hi strang ey and answer
you have mani titl princ is not on of them lord of rebirth
and if so how did you get it and what doe it mean
it is what it mean i do not know but it wa given to me becaus of
some dream that my mother had the night befor i wa born do you tell
me what it mean sinc you seem to know so much
i cannot princ the secret is not on that ha been shown to me yet
there wa an ag man a magician like myself from whom i learn much
in my youthbakenkhonsu knew him wellwho made a studi of thi matter
he told me he wa sure becaus it had been reveal to him that men
do not live onc onli and then depart henc for ever he said that thei
live mani time and in mani shape though not alwai on thi world and
that between each life there is a wall of dark
if so of what us ar live which we do not rememb after death ha
shut the door of each of them
the door mai open again at last princ and show us all the chamber
through which our feet have wander from the begin
our religion teach us ki that after death we live etern
elsewher in our own bodi which we find again on the dai of
resurrect now etern have no end can have no begin it is
a circl therefor if the on be true name that we live on it would
seem that the other must be true name that we have alwai live
that is well reason princ in the earli dai befor the priest
froze the thought of man into block of stone and built of them shrine
to a thousand god mani held that thi reason wa true as then thei
held that there wa but on god
as do these israelit whom i go to visit what sai you of their god
ki
that he is the same as our god princ to men ey god ha mani
face and each swear that the on he see is the onli true god yet
thei ar wrong for all ar true
or perchanc fals ki unless even falsehood is a part of truth well
you have told me of two danger on to my bodi and on to my heart ha
ani other been reveal to your wisdom
ye princ the third is that thi journei mai in the end cost you
your throne
if i die certainli it will cost me my throne
no princ if you live
even so ki i think that i could endur life seat more humbl than
on a throne though whether her high could endur it is anoth
matter then you sai that if i go upon thi journei anoth will be
pharaoh in my place
we do not sai that princ it is true that our art have shown us
anoth fill your place in a time of wizardri and wonder and of the
death of thousand yet when we look again we see not that other but you
onc more fill your own place
here i ana bethought me of my vision in pharaoh hall
the matter is even wors than i thought ki sinc have onc left
the crown behind me i think that i should have no wish to wear it ani
more said seti who show you all these thing and how
our ka which ar our secret selv show them to us princ and in
mani wai sometim it is by dream or vision sometim by pictur
on water sometim by write in the desert sand in all these
fashion and by other our ka draw from the infinit well of
wisdom that is hidden in the be of everi man give us glimps of the
truth as thei give us who ar instruct power to work marvel
of the truth then these thing you tell me ar true
we believ so princ
then be true must happen so what is the us of your warn me
against what must happen there cannot be two truth what would you
have me do not go upon thi journei why have you told me that i must
not go sinc if i did not go the truth would becom a lie which it
cannot you sai it is fate that i should go and becaus i go such and
such thing will come about and yet you tell me not to go for that is
what you mean oh kherheb ki and bakenkhonsu doubtless you ar great
magician and strong in wisdom but there ar greater than you who rule
the world and there is a wisdom to which your is but as a drop of
water to the nile i thank you for your warn but tomorrow i go
down to the land of goshen to fulfil the command of pharaoh if i come
back again we will talk more of these matter here upon the earth if i
do not come back perchanc we will talk of them elsewher farewel
chapter vi
the land of goshen
the princ seti and all hi train a veri great compani came in safeti
to the land of goshen i ana travel with him in hi chariot it
wa then as now a rich land quit flat after the last line of desert
hill through which we travel by a narrow tortuou path everywher
it wa water by canal between which lai the grain field wherein the
seed had just been sown also there were other field of green fodder
whereon were tether beast by the hundr and beyond these upon the
drier soil graze flock of sheep the town goshen if so it could
be call wa but a poor place number of mud hut no more in the
centr of which stood a build also of mud with two brick pillar in
front of it that we were told wa the templ of thi peopl into the
inner part of which none might enter save their highpriest i laugh
at the sight of it but the princ reprov me sai that i should not
judg the spirit by the bodi or of the god by hi hous
we camp outsid thi town and soon learn that the peopl who dwelt
in it or elsewher in other town must be number by the ten thousand
for more of them than i could count wander round the camp to look at
us the men were fierceei and hooknos the young women wellshap
and pleasant to behold the older women for the most part stout and
somewhat unwieldi and the children veri beauti all were roughli
clad in robe of looselywoven darkcolour cloth beneath which the
women wore garment of white linen notwithstand the wealth we
saw about us in corn and cattl their ornament seem to be few or
perhap these were hidden from our sight
it wa easi to see that thei hate us egyptian and even dare to
despis us hate shone in their glitter ey and i heard them
call us the idolworshipp on to the other and ask where wa
our god the bull for be ignor thei thought that we worship
api as mayhap some of the common peopl do instead of look upon
the sacr beast as a symbol of the power of natur inde thei did
more for on the first night after our come thei slaughter a bull
mark much as api is and in the morn we found it ly near the
gate of the camp and pin to it hide with sharp thorn great number
of the scarabu beetl still live for again thei did not know that
among us egyptian thi beetl is no god but an emblem of the creator
becaus it roll a ball of mud between it feet and set therein it
egg to hatch as the creator roll the world that seem to be round
and caus it to produc life
now all were angri at these insult except the princ who laugh
and said that he thought the jest coars but clever but wors wa to
happen it seem that a soldier with wine in him had done insult to a
hebrew maiden who came alon to draw water at a canal the new spread
among the peopl and some thousand of them rush to the camp shout
and demand vengeanc in so threaten a manner that it wa necessari
to form up the regiment of guard
the princ be summon command that the girl and her kin should be
admit and state their case she came weep and wail and tear
her garment throw dust on her head also though it appear that
she had taken no great harm from the soldier from whom she ran awai the
princ bade her point out the man if she could see him and she show
us on of the bodyguard of the count amenmes whose face wa scratch
as though by a woman nail on be question he said he could
rememb littl of the matter but confess that he had seen the maiden
by the canal at moonris and jest with her
the kin of thi girl clamour that he should be kill becaus he had
offer insult to a highborn ladi of israel thi seti refus sai
that the offenc wa not on of death but that he would order him to
be publicli beaten thereupon amenmes who wa fond of the soldier a
good man enough when not in hi cup sprang up in a rage sai that
no servant of hi should be touch becaus he had offer to caress
some light israelitish woman who had no busi to be wander about
alon at night he ad that if the man were flog he and all those
under hi command would leav the camp and march back to make report to
pharaoh
now the princ have consult with the councillor told the woman
and her kin that as pharaoh had been appeal to he must judg of the
matter and command them to appear at hi court within a month and
state their case against the soldier thei went awai veri illsatisfi
sai that amenmes had insult their daughter even more than hi
servant had done the end of thi matter wa that on the follow night
thi soldier wa discov dead pierc through and through with knife
thrust the girl her parent and brethren could not be found have
fled awai into the desert nor wa there ani evid to show by whom
the soldier had been murder therefor noth could be done in the
busi except buri the victim
on the follow morn the inquiri began with due ceremoni the princ
seti and the count amenmes take their seat at the head of a larg
pavilion with the councillor behind them and the scribe among whom i
wa seat at their feet then we learn that the two prophet whom i
had seen at pharaoh court were not in the land of goshen have left
befor we arriv to sacrific to god in the wilder nor did ani
know when thei would return other elder and priest howev appear
and began to set out their case which thei did at great length and in
a fierc and turbul fashion speak often all of them at onc thu
make it difficult for the interpret to render their word sinc
thei pretend that thei did not know the egyptian tongu
moreov thei told their stori from the veri begin when thei had
enter egypt hundr of year befor and were succour by the vizier
of the pharaoh of that dai on yusuf a power and clever man of
their race who store corn in a time of famin and low nile thi
pharaoh wa of the hykso peopl on of the shepherd king whom we
egyptian hate and after mani war drove out of khem under these
shepherd king be join by mani of their own blood the israelit
grew rich and power so that the pharaoh who came after and who
love them not began to fear them
thi wa as far as the stori wa taken on the first dai
on the second dai began the tale of their oppress under which
howev thei still multipli like gnat upon the nile and grew so
strong and numer that at length the great rames did a wick thing
order that their male children should be put to death thi order wa
never carri out becaus hi daughter she who found mose among the
reed of the river plead for them
at thi point the princ weari with the nois and heat in that
crowd place broke off the sit until the morrow command me to
accompani him he order a chariot not hi own to be made readi and
although i prai him not to do so set out unguard save for myself
and the chariot sai that he would see how these peopl labour
with hi own ey
take a hebrew lad to run befor the hors as our guid we drove
to the bank of a canal where the israelit made brick of mud which
after dry in the sun were laden into boat that wait for them on
the canal and taken awai to other part of egypt to be us on pharaoh
work thousand of men were engag upon thi labour toil in gang
under the command of egyptian overs who kept count of the brick
cut their number upon talli stick or sometim write them upon
sherd these overs were brutal fellow for the most part of the
low class who us vile languag to the slave nor were thei content
with word note a crowd gather at on place and hear cri we
went to see what pass here we found a lad stretch upon the ground
be cruelli beaten with hide whip so that the blood ran down him
at a sign from the princ i ask what he had done and wa told roughli
for the overs and their guard did not know who we were that dure
the past six dai he had onli made half of hi allot tale of brick
loos him said the princ quietli
who ar you that give me order ask the head overs who wa
help to hold the lad while the guard flog him begon lest i
serv you as i serv thi idl fellow
seti look at him and as he look hi lip turn white
tell him he said to me
you dog i gasp do you know who it is to whom you dare to speak
thu
no nor care lai on guard
the princ whose robe were hidden by a widesleev cloak of common
stuff and make threw the cloak open reveal beneath it the pector
he had worn in the court a beauti thing of gold whereon were
inscrib hi royal name and titl in black and red enamel also he
held up hi right hand on which wa a signet of pharaoh that he wore
as hi commission the men stare then on of them who wa more
learn than the rest cri
by the god thi is hi high the princ of egypt at which word
all of them fell upon their face
rise said seti to the lad who look at him forget hi pain in
hi wonder and tell me why you have not deliv your tale of
brick
sir sob the boi in bad egyptian for two reason first becaus
i am a crippl see and he held up hi left arm which wa wither and
thin as a mummi and therefor cannot work quickli secondli becaus
my mother whose onli child i am is a widow and li sick in bed so
that there ar no women or children in our home who can go out to gather
straw for me as pharaoh ha command that we should do therefor
i must spend mani hour in search for straw sinc i have no mean
wherewith to pai other to do thi for me
ana said the princ write down thi youth name with the place of
hi abod and if hi tale prove true see that hi want and those of
hi mother ar reliev befor we depart from goshen write down also
the name of thi overs and hi fellow and command them to report
themselv at my camp tomorrow at sunris when their case shall be
consid sai to the lad also that be on afflict by the god
pharaoh free him from the make of brick and all other labour of the
state
now while i did these thing the overs and hi companion beat their
head upon the ground and prai for merci be coward as the cruel
alwai ar hi high answer them never a word but onli look
at them with cold ey and i note that hi face which wa so kind had
grown terribl so those men thought also for that night thei ran awai
to syria leav their famili and all their good behind them nor
were thei ever seen again in egypt
when i had finish write the princ turn and walk to where the
chariot wait bade the driver cross the canal by a bridg there
wa here we drove on a while in silenc follow a track which ran
between the cultiv land and the desert at length i point to the
sink sun and ask if it were not time to return
why repli the princ the sun di but there rise the full moon
to give us light and what have we to fear with sword at our side and
her high userti mail beneath our robe oh ana i am weari of
men with their cruelti and shout and struggl and i find thi
wilder a place of rest for in it i seem to draw nearer to my own
soul and the heaven whenc it came or so i hope
your high is fortun to have a soul to which he care to draw
near it is not so with all of us i answer laugh for i sought to
chang the current of hi thought by provok argument of a sort that
he love
just then howev the hors which were not of the best came to a
halt on a slope of heavi sand nor would seti allow the driver to flog
them but command him to let them rest a space while thei did so we
descend from the chariot and walk up the desert rise he lean on
my arm as we reach it crest we heard sob and a soft voic speak
on the further side who it wa that spoke and sob we could not see
becaus of a line of tamarisk shrub which onc had been a fenc
more cruelti or at least more sorrow whisper seti let us look
so we crept to the tamarisk and peep through their featheri top
saw a veri sweet sight in the pure rai of that desert moon there not
five pace awai stood a woman clad in white young and shape in form
her face we could not see becaus it wa turn from us also the long
dark hair which stream about her shoulder hid it she wa prai
aloud speak now in hebrew of which both of us knew someth
and now in egyptian as doe on who is accustom to think in either
tongu and stop from time to time to sob
o god of my peopl she said send me succour and bring me safe home
that thy child mai not be left alon in the wilder to becom the
prei of wild beast or of men who ar wors than beast
then she sob knelt down on a great bundl which i saw wa stubbl
straw and again began to prai thi time it wa in egyptian as though
she fear lest the hebrew should be overheard and understood
o god she said o god of my father help my poor heart help my
poor heart
we were about to withdraw or rather to ask her what she ail when
suddenli she turn her head so that the light fell full upon her
face so love wa it that i caught my breath and the princ at my side
start inde it wa more than love for as a lamp shine through an
alabast vase or a shell of pearl so did the spirit within thi woman
shine through her tearstain face make it mysteri as the night
then i understood perhap for the first time that it is the spirit
which give true beauti both to maid and man and not the flesh the
white vase of alabast howev shape is still a vase alon it
is the hidden lamp within that grace it with the glori of a star and
those ey those larg dream ey aswim with tear and hu
like richest lapislazuli oh what man could look on them and not be
stir
merapi i whisper
moon of israel murmur seti fill with the moon love as the
moon mystic as the moon and worship the moon her mother
she is in troubl let us help her i said
nai wait a while ana for never again shall you and i see such a
sight as thi
low as we spoke beneath our breath i think the ladi heard us at least
her face chang and grew frighten hastili she rose lift the great
bundl of straw upon which she had been kneel and place it on her
head she ran a few step then stumbl and sank down with a littl
moan of pain in an instant we were at her side she stare at us
affright for who we were she could not see becaus of the wide
hood of our common cloak that made us look like midnight thiev or
slaved bedouin
oh sir she babbl harm me not i have noth of valu on me
save thi amulet
who ar you and what do you here ask the princ disguis hi
voic
sir i am merapi the daughter of nathan the levit he whom the
accurs egyptian captain khuaka murder at tani
how do you dare to call the egyptian accurs ask seti in tone
made gruff to hide hi laughter
oh sir becaus thei arei mean becaus i thought you were arab who
hate them as we do at least thi egyptian wa accurs for the high
princ seti pharaoh heir caus him to be behead for that crime
and do you hate the high princ seti pharaoh heir and call him
accurs
she hesit then in a doubt voic said
no i do not hate him
why not see that you hate the egyptian of whom he is on of
the first and therefor twice worthi of hatr be the son of your
oppressor pharaoh
becaus although i have tri my best i cannot also she ad with
the joi of on who ha found a good reason he aveng my father
thi is no caus girl see that he onli did what the law forc him
to do thei sai that thi dog of a pharaoh son is here in goshen upon
some mission is it true and have you seen him answer for we of the
desert folk desir to know
i believ it is true sir but i have not seen him
why not if he is here
becaus i do not wish to sir why should a daughter of israel desir
to look upon the face of a princ of egypt
in truth i do not know repli seti forget hi feign voic
then see that she glanc at him sharpli he ad in gruff tone
brother either thi woman li or she is none other than the maid thei
call moon of israel who dwell with old jabez the levit her uncl
what think you
i think brother that she li and for three reason i answer
fall into the jest first she is too fair to be of the black hebrew
blood
oh sir moan merapi my mother wa a syrian ladi of the mountain
with a skin as white as milk and ey blue as the heaven
secondli i went on without heed her if the great princ seti is
realli in goshen and she dwell there it is unnatur that she should
not have gone to look upon him be a woman onli two thing would have
kept her awai onethat she fear and hate him which she deni and
the otherthat she like him too well and be prudent thought it
wisest not to look upon him more
when she heard the first of these word merapi glanc up with her lip
part as though to answer instead she drop her ey and suddenli
seem to choke while even in the moonlight i saw the red blood pour to
her brow and along her white arm
sir she gasp why should you affront me i swear that never till
thi moment did i think such a thing sure it would be treason
without doubt interrupt seti yet on of a sort that king might
pardon
thirdli i went on as though i had heard neither of them if thi
girl were what she declar she would not be wander alon in the
desert at night see that i have heard among the arab that merapi
daughter of nathan the levit is a ladi of no mean blood among the
hebrew and that her famili ha wealth still howev much she li we
can see for ourselv that she is beauti
ye brother in that we ar fortun sinc without doubt she will
sell for a high price among the slave trader beyond the desert
oh sir cri merapi seiz the hem of hi robe sure you who
i feel i know not why ar no evil thief you who have a mother and
perchanc sister would not doom a maiden to such a fate misjudg me
not becaus i am alon pharaoh ha command that we must find straw
for the make of brick thi morn i came far to search for it on
behalf of a neighbour whose wife is ill in childb but toward sundown
i slip and cut myself upon the edg of a sharp stone see and
hold up her foot she show a wound beneath the instep from which the
blood still drop a sight that move both of us not a littl and
now i cannot walk and carri thi heavi straw which i have been at such
pain to gather
perchanc she speak truth brother said the princ and if we took
her home we might earn no small reward from jabez the levit but first
tell me maiden what wa that prayer which you made to the moon that
hathor should help your heart
sir she answer onli the idolatr egyptian prai to hathor the
ladi of love
i thought that all the world prai to the ladi of love maiden but
what of the prayer is there some man whom you desir
none she answer angrili
then why doe your heart need so much help that you ask it of the air
is there perchanc someon whom you do not desir
she hung her head and made no answer
come brother said the princ thi ladi is weari of us and i
think that if she were a true woman she would answer our question more
readili let us go and leav her as she cannot walk we can take her
later if we wish
sir she said i am glad that you ar go sinc the hyena will
be safer compani than two men who can threaten to sell a helpless
woman into slaveri yet as we part to meet no more i will answer your
question in the prayer to which you were not asham to listen i did
not prai for ani lover i prai to be rid of on
now ana said the princ burst into laughter and throw back hi
dark cloak do you discov the name of that unhappi man of whom the
ladi merapi wish to be rid for i dare not
she gaze into hi face and utter a littl cry
ah she said i thought i knew the voic again when onc you forget
your part princ seti doe your high think that thi wa a kind
jest to practis upon on alon and in fear
ladi merapi he answer smile be not wroth for at least it wa
a good on and you have told us noth that we did not know you mai
rememb that at tani you said that you were affianc and there wa
that in your voic suffer me now to tend thi wound of your
then he knelt down tore a strip from hi ceremoni robe of fine linen
and began to bind up her foot not unskilfulli be a man full of
strang and unexpect knowledg as he work at the task watch
them i saw their ey meet saw too that rich flood of colour creep
onc more to merapi brow then i began to think it unseemli that the
princ of egypt should plai the leech to a woman hurt and to wonder
why he had not left that humbl task to me
present the bandag wa done and made fast with a royal scarabu
mount on a pin of gold which the princ wore in hi garment on it
wa cut the uru crown and beneath it were the sign which read lord
of the lower and the upper land be pharaoh style and titl
see now ladi he said you have egypt beneath your foot and when
she ask him what he meant he read her the write upon the jewel
whereat for the third time she colour to the ey then he lift
her up instruct her to rest her weight upon hi shoulder sai he
fear lest the scarab which he valu should be broken
thu we start i bear the bundl of straw behind as he bade me
sinc he said have been gather with such toil it must not be
lost on reach the chariot where we found the guid gone and the
driver asleep he sat her in it upon hi cloak and wrap her in mine
which he borrow sai i should not need it who must carri the straw
then he mount also and thei drove awai at a foot pace as i walk
after the chariot with the straw that fell about my ear i heard
noth of their further talk if inde thei talk at all which the
driver be present perhap thei did not nor in truth did i listen
who wa engag in thought as to the hard lot of these poor hebrew who
must collect thi dirti stuff and bear it so far made heavi as it wa
by the clai that clung about the root
even now as it chanc we did not reach goshen without further
troubl just as we had cross the bridg over the canal i toil
behind saw in the clear moonlight a young man run toward us he
wa a hebrew tall wellmad and veri handsom in hi fashion hi ey
were dark and fierc hi nose wa hook hi teeth where regular and
white and hi long black hair hung down in a mass upon hi shoulder
he held a wooden staff in hi hand and a nake knife wa gird about
hi middl see the chariot he halt and peer at it then ask in
hebrew if those who travel had seen aught of a young israelitish ladi
who wa lost
if you seek me laban i am here repli merapi speak from the
shadow of the cloak
what do you there alon with an egyptian merapi he said fierc
what follow i do not know for thei spoke so quickli in their
unfamiliar tongu that i could not understand them at length merapi
turn to the princ sai
lord thi is laban my affianc who command me to descend from the
chariot and accompani him as best i can
and i ladi command you to stai in it laban your affianc can
accompani us
now at thi laban grew angri as i could see he wa prone to do and
stretch out hi hand as though to push seti asid and seiz merapi
have a care man said the princ while i throw down the straw
drew my sword and sprang between them cry
slave would you lai hand upon the princ of egypt
princ of egypt he said draw back astonish then ad
sullenli well what doe the princ of egypt with my affianc
he help her who is hurt to her home have found her helpless in the
desert with thi accurs straw i answer
forward driver said the princ and merapi ad peac laban and
bear the straw which hi highnesss companion ha carri such a weari
wai
he hesit a moment then snatch up the bundl and set it on hi
head
as we walk side by side hi evil temper seem to get the better
of him without ceas he grumbl becaus merapi wa alon in the
chariot with an egyptian at length i could bear it no longer
be silent fellow i said least of all men should you complain of
what hi high doe see that alreadi he ha aveng the kill
of thi ladi father and now ha save her from ly out all night
among the wild beast and men of the wilder
of the first i have heard more than enough he answer and of
the second doubtless i shall hear more than enough also ever sinc my
affianc met thi princ she ha look on me with differ ey and
spoken to me with anoth voic ye and when i press for marriag she
sai it cannot be for a long while yet becaus she is mourn for her
father her father forsooth whom she never forgav becaus he betroth
her to me accord to the custom of our peopl
perhap she love some other man i queri wish to learn all i
could about thi ladi
she love no man or did not a while ago she love herself alon
on with so much beauti mai look high in marriag
high he repli furious how can she look higher than myself
who am a lord of the line of judah and therefor greater far than an
upstart princ or ani other egyptian were he pharaoh himself
sure you must be trumpet to your tribe i mock for my temper
wa rise
why he ask ar not the hebrew greater than the egyptian as
those oppressor soon shall learn and is not a lord of israel more than
ani idolworshipp among your peopl
i look at the man clad in mean garment and foul from hi labour in
the brickfield marvel at hi insol there wa no doubt but that
he believ what he said i could see it in hi proud ey and bear
he thought that hi tribe wa of more import in the world than our great
and ancient nation and that he an unknown youth equal or surpass
pharaoh himself then be enrag by these insult i answer
you sai so but let us put it to the proof i am but a scribe yet
i have seen war linger a littl that we mai learn whether a lord of
israel is better than a scribe of egypt
gladli would i chastis you writer he answer did i not see your
plot you wish to delai me here and perhap to murder me by some foul
mean while your master bask in the smile of the moon of israel
therefor i will not stai but anoth time it shall be as you wish and
perhap er long
now i think that i should have struck him in the face though i am not
on of those who love brawl but at thi moment there appear a
compani of egyptian hors led by none other than the count amenmes
see the princ in the chariot thei halt and gave the salut
amenmes leapt to the ground
we ar come out to search for your high he said fear lest
some hurt had befallen you
i thank you cousin answer the princ but the hurt ha befallen
anoth not me

smile where is the ladi wound not in the breast i trust
no cousin in the foot which is why she travel with me in thi
chariot
your high wa ever kind to the unfortun i prai you let me take
your place or suffer me to set thi girl upon a hors
drive on said seti
so escort by the soldier whom i heard make jest to each other
about the princ and the ladi as i think did the hebrew laban also for
he glare about him and ground hi teeth we came at last to the town
here guid by merapi the chariot wa halt at the hous of jabez her
uncl a whitebeard old hebrew with a cun ey who rush from
the door of hi mudroof dwell cry he had done no harm that
soldier should come to take him
it is not you whom the egyptian wish to captur it is your niec and
my betroth shout laban whereat the soldier laugh as did some
women who had gather round meanwhil the princ wa help merapi to
descend out of the chariot from which inde he lift her the sight
seem to madden laban who rush forward to tear her from hi arm
and in the attempt jostl hi high the captain of the soldiersh
wa an offic of pharaoh bodyguardlift hi sword in a furi and
struck laban such a blow upon the head with the flat of the blade that
he fell upon hi face and lai there groan
awai with that hebrew dog and scourg him cri the captain is the
royal blood of egypt to be handl by such as he
soldier sprang forward to do hi bid but seti said quietli
let the fellow be friend he lack manner that is all is he hurt
as he spoke laban leapt to hi feet and fear wors thing fled awai
with a curs and a glare of hate at the princ
farewel ladi said seti i wish you a quick recoveri
i thank your high she answer look about her confusedli be
pleas to wait a littl while that i mai return to you your jewel
nai keep it ladi and if ever you ar in need or troubl of ani sort

she glanc at him and burst into tear
why do you weep he ask
oh your high becaus i fear that troubl is near at hand my
affianc laban ha a reveng heart help me to the hous my
uncl

would not go sorrow shall be your portion and that of all with whom you
have to do do you hear
o my lord i hear i hear fear noth she shall be guard carefulli
asa she will doubtless guard that trinket on her foot
ana said the princ to me that night when i wa talk with him
befor he went to rest i know not why but i fear that man laban he
ha an evil ey
i too think it would have been better if your high had left him to
be dealt with by the soldier after which there would have been noth
to fear from him in thi world
well i did not so there an end ana she is a fair woman and a
sweet
the fairest and the sweetest that ever i saw my princ
be care ana i prai you be care lest you should fall in love
with on who is alreadi affianc
i onli look at him in answer and as i look i bethought me of the
word of ki the magician so i think did the princ at least he
laugh not unhappili and turn awai
for my part i rest ill that night and when at last i slept it wa to
dream of merapi make her prayer in the rai of the moon
chapter vii
the ambush
eight full dai went by befor we left the land of goshen the stori
that the israelit had to tell wa long sad also moreov thei gave
evid as to mani cruel thing that thei had suffer and when thi
wa finish the testimoni of the guard and other must be call all
of which it wa necessari to write down lastli the princ seem to
be in no hurri to be gone as he said becaus he hope that the two
prophet would return from the wilder which thei never did dure
all thi time seti saw no more of merapi nor inde did he speak
of her even when the count amenmes jest him as to hi chariot
companion and ask him if he had driven again in the desert by
moonlight
i howev saw her onc when i wa wander in the town on dai
toward sunset i met her walk with her uncl jabez upon on side and
her lover laban on the other like a prison between two guard i
thought she look unhappi but her foot seem to be well again at
least she move without limp
i stop to salut her but laban scowl and hurri her awai jabez
stai behind and fell into talk with me he told me that she wa
recov of her hurt but that there had been troubl between her and
laban becaus of all that happen on that even when she came by it
end in hi encount with the captain
thi young man seem to be of a jealou natur i said on who will
make a harsh husband for ani woman
ye learn scribe jealousi ha been hi curs from youth as it is
with so mani of our peopl and i thank god that i am not the woman whom
he is to marri
why then do you suffer her to marri him jabez
becaus her father affianc her to thi lion whelp when she wa
scarc more than a child and among us that is a bond hard to break
for my own part he ad drop hi voic and glanc round with
shift ey i should like to see my niec in some differ place
to that of the wife of laban with her great beauti and wit she might
becom anythinganyth if she had opportun but under our law
even if laban di as might happen to so violent a man she could wed
no on who is not a hebrew
i thought she told us that her mother wa a syrian
that is so scribe ana she wa a beauti captiv of war whom nathan
came to love and made hi wife and the daughter take after her still
she is hebrew and of the hebrew faith and congreg had it not been
so she might have shone like a star nai like the veri moon after
which she is name perhap in the court of pharaoh himself
as the great queen taia did she who chang the religion of egypt to
the worship of on god in a bygon gener i suggest
i have heard of her scribe ana she wa a wondrou woman beauti
too by her statu would that you egyptian could find such anoth
to turn your heart to a purer faith and to soften them toward us poor
alien when doe hi high leav the land of goshen
at sunris on the third dai from thi
provis will be need for the journei much provis for so larg a
train i deal in sheep and other foodstuff scribe ana
i will mention the matter to hi high and to the vizier jabez
i thank you scribe and will in wait at the camp tomorrow morn
see laban return with merapi on word let hi high bewar of
laban he is veri reveng and ha not forgotten that swordblow on
the head
let laban be care i answer had it not been for hi high
the soldier would have kill him the other night becaus he dare
to offer affront to the royal blood a second time he will not escap
moreov pharaoh would aveng aught he did upon the peopl of israel
i understand it would be sad if laban were kill veri sad but the
peopl of israel have on who can protect them even against pharaoh and
all hi host farewel learn scribe if ever i come to tani with
your leav we will talk more togeth
that night i told the princ all that had pass he listen and said
i griev for the ladi merapi for her is like to be a hard fate yet
he ad laugh perhap it is as well for you friend that you
should see no more of her who is sure to bring troubl wherev she
goe that woman ha a face which haunt the mind as the ka haunt the
tomb and for my part i do not wish to look upon it again
i am glad to hear it princ and for my part i have done with women
howev sweet i will tell thi jabez that the provis for the
journei will be bought elsewher
nai bui them from him and if nehesi grumbl at the price pai it on
my account the wai to a hebrew heart is through hi treasur bag
if jabez is well treat it mai make him kinder to hi niec of whom i
shall alwai have a pleasant memori for which i am grate among thi
sour folk who hate us and with reason
so the sheep and all the foodstuff for the journei were bought from
jabez at hi own price for which he thank me much and on the third
dai we start at the last moment the princ whose mood seem to be
pervers that even refus to travel with the host upon the morrow
becaus of the nois and dust in vain did the count amenmes reason
with him and nehesi and the great offic implor him almost on their
knee sai that thei must answer for hi safeti to pharaoh and the
princess userti he bade them begon repli that he would join them
at their camp on the follow night i also prai him to listen but
he told me sharpli that what he said he had said and that he and i
would journei in hi chariot alon with two arm runner and no more
ad that if i thought there wa danger i could go forward with the
troop then i bit my lip and wa silent whereon see that he had
hurt me he turn and crave my pardon humbl enough as hi kind heart
taught him to do
i can bear no more of amenmes and those offic he said and i
love to be in the desert alon last time we journei there we met with
adventur that were pleasant ana and at tani doubtless i shall find
other that ar not pleasant admit that hebrew priest who is wait to
instruct me in the mysteri of hi faith which i desir to understand
so i bow and left him to make report that i had fail to shake hi
will take the risk of hi wrath howev i did thisfor had i not
sworn to the princess that i would protect him in place of the runner
i chose two of the best and bravest soldier to plai their part
moreov i instruct that captain who smote down laban to hide awai
with a score of pick men and enough chariot to carri them and to
follow after the princ keep just out of sight
so on the morrow the troop nobl and offic went on at daybreak
togeth with the baggag carrier nor did we follow them till mani
hour had gone by some of thi time the princ spent in drive about
the town take note of the condit of the peopl these as i saw
look on us sullenli enough more so than befor i thought perhap
becaus we were unguard inde turn round i caught sight of a man
shake hi fist and of an old hag spit after us and wish that we
were out of the land of goshen but when i report it to the princ he
onli laugh and took no heed
all can see that thei hate us egyptian he said well let it be our
task to try to turn their hate to love
that you will never do princ it is too deeproot in their
heart for gener thei have drunk it in with their mother milk
moreov thi is a war of the god of egypt and of israel and men must
go where their god drive them
do you think so ana then ar men noth but dust blown by the
wind of heaven blown from the dark that is befor the dawn to be
gather at last and for ever into the dark of the grave of night
he brood a while then went on
yet if i were pharaoh i would let these peopl go for without doubt
their god ha much power and i tell you that i fear them
why will he not let them go i ask thei ar a weak not a
strength to egypt as wa shown at the time of the invas of the
barbarian with whom thei side moreov the valu of thi rich land
of their which thei cannot take with them is greater than that of all
their labour
i do not know friend the matter is on upon which my father keep
hi own counsel even from the princess userti perhap it is becaus he
will not chang the polici of hi father rames perhap becaus he is
stiffneck to those who cross hi will or it mai be that he is held
in thi path by a mad sent of some god to bring loss and shame on
egypt
then princ all the priest and nobl ar mad also from count
amenmes down
where pharaoh lead priest and nobl follow the question is who
lead pharaoh here is the templ of these hebrew let us enter
so we descend from the chariot where for my part i would have
remain and walk through the gatewai in the surround mud wall
into the outer court of the templ which on thi the holi seventh dai
of the hebrew wa full of prai women who feign not to see us yet
watch us out of the corner of their ey pass through them we
came to a doorwai by which we enter anoth court that wa roof
over here were mani men who murmur as we appear thei were engag
in listen to a preacher in a white robe who wore a strang shape
cap and some ornament on hi breast i knew the man he wa the priest
kohath who had instruct the princ in so much of the mysteri of the
hebrew faith as he chose to reveal on see us he ceas suddenli in
hi discours utter some hasti bless and advanc to greet us
i wait behind the princ think it well to watch hi back among all
those fierc men and did not hear what the priest said to him as he
whisper in that holi place kohath led him forward to free him from
the throng i thought till thei came to the head of the littl templ
that wa mark by some step abov which hung a thick and heavi
curtain the princ walk on did not see the lowest of these step
in the gloom which wa deep hi foot caught on it he fell forward
and to save himself grasp at the curtain where the two halv of it
met and drag it open reveal a chamber plain and small beyond in
which wa an altar that wa all i had time to see for next instant a
roar of rage rent the air and knive flash in the gloom
the egyptian defil the tabernacl shout on drag him out and
kill him scream anoth
friend said seti turn as thei surg toward him if i have
done aught wrong it wa by chanc
he could add no more see that thei were on him or rather on me who
had leapt in front of him alreadi thei had grasp my robe and my hand
wa on my swordhilt when the priest kohath cri out
men of israel ar you mad would you bring pharaoh vengeanc on us
thei halt a littl and their spokesman shout
we defi pharaoh our god will protect us from pharaoh drag him forth
and kill him beyond the wall
again thei began to move when a man in whom i recogn jabez the
uncl of merapi call aloud
ceas if thi princ of egypt ha done insult to jahveh by will and
not by chanc it is certain that he will aveng himself upon him shall
men take the judgment of god into their own hand stand back and wait
awhil if jahveh is affront the egyptian will fall dead if he doe
not fall dead let him pass henc unharm for such is jahveh will
stand back i sai while i count threescor
thei withdrew a space and slowli jabez began to count
although at that time i knew noth of the power of the god of israel
i will sai that i wa fill with fear as on by on he count paus
at each ten the scene wa veri strang there by the step stood the
princ against the background of the curtain hi arm fold and a
littl smile of wonder mix with contempt upon hi face but not a sign
of fear on on side of him wa i who knew well that i should share hi
fate whatev it might be and inde desir no other and on the other
the priest kohath whose hand shook and whose ey start from hi
head in front of us old jabez count watch the fiercefac
congreg that in a dead silenc wait for the issu the count went
on thirti forti fiftyoh it seem an ag
at length sixti fell from hi lip he wait a while and all watch
the princ not doubt but that he would fall dead but instead he
turn to kohath and ask quietli if thi ordeal wa now finish as
he desir to make an offer to the templ which he had been invit
to visit and begon
our god ha given hi answer said jabez accept it men of israel
what thi princ did he did by chanc not of design
thei turn and went without a word and after i had laid the offer
no mean on in the appoint place we follow them
it would seem that your is no gentl god said the princ to kohath
when at length we were outsid the templ
at least he is just your high had it been otherwis you who had
violat hi sanctuari although by chanc would er now be dead
then you hold priest that jahveh ha power to slai us when he is
angri
without a doubt your highnessa if our prophet speak truth i
think that egypt will learn er all be done he ad grimli
seti look at him and answer
it mai be so but all god or their priest claim the power to
torment and slai those who worship other god it is not onli women who
ar jealou kohath or so it seem yet i think that you do your god
injustic see that even if thi strength is hi he prove more
merci than hi worshipp who knew well that i onli grasp the veil
to save myself from fall if ever i visit your templ again it shall
be in the compani of those who can match might against might whether of
the spirit or the sword farewel
so we reach the chariot near to which stood jabez he who had save
us
princ he whisper glanc at the crowd who linger not far awai
silent and glower i prai you leav thi land swiftli for here your
life is not safe i know it wa by chanc but you have defil the
sanctuari and seen that upon which ey mai not look save those of the
highest priest an offenc no israelit can forgiv
and you or your peopl jabez would have defil thi sanctuari of
my life spill my heart blood and not by chanc sure you ar
a strang folk who seek to make an enemi of on who ha tri to be your
friend
i do not seek it exclaim jabez i would that we might have
pharaoh mouth and ear who soon will himself be pharaoh upon our side
o princ of egypt be not wroth with all the children of israel becaus
their wrong have made some few of them stubborn and hardheart
begon now and of your good rememb my word
i will rememb said seti sign to the chariot to drive on
yet still the princ linger in the town sai that he fear noth
and would learn all he could of thi peopl and their wai that he might
report the better of them to pharaoh for my part i believ that there
wa on face which he wish to see again befor he left but of thi i
thought it wise to sai noth
at length about middai we did depart and drove eastward on the track
of amenmes and our compani all the afternoon we drove thu preced
by the two soldier disguis as runner and follow as a distant
cloud of dust told me by the captain and hi chariot whom i had
secretli command to keep us in sight
toward even we came to the pass in the stori hill which bound the
land of goshen here seti descend from the chariot and we climb
accompani by the two soldier whom i sign to follow us to the crest
of on of these hill that wa strewn with huge boulder and line with
ridg of sandston between which gulli had been cut by the wind of
thousand of year
lean against on of these ridg we look back upon a wondrou
sight far awai across the fertil plain appear the town that we had
left and behind it the sun sank it would seem as though some storm
had broken there although the firmament abov us wa clear and blue
at least in front of the town two huge pillar of cloud stretch from
earth to heaven like the column of some mighti gatewai on of these
pillar wa as though it were made of black marbl and the other like
to molten gold between them ran a road of light end in a glori and
in the midst of the glori the round ball of ra the sun burn like the
ey of god the spectacl wa as awesom as it wa splendid
have you ever seen such a sky in egypt princ i ask
never he answer and although he spoke low in that great still
hi voic sound loud to me
for a while longer we watch till suddenli the sun sank and onli the
glori about it and abov remain which took shape like to the palac
and templ of a citi in the heaven a far citi that no mortal could
reach except in dream
i know not why ana said seti but for the first time sinc i wa a
man i feel afraid it seem to me that there ar omen in the sky and i
cannot read them would that ki were here to tell us what is signifi
by the pillar of black to the right and the pillar of fire to the
left and what god ha hi home in the citi of glori behind and how
man feet mai walk along the shine road which lead to it pylon
gate i tell you that i am afraid it is as though death were veri near
to me and all hi wonder open to my mortal sight
i too am afraid i whisper look the pillar move that of fire
goe befor that of black cloud follow after and between them i seem
to see a countless multitud march in unend compani see how the
light glitter on their spear sure the god of the hebrew is afoot
he or some other god or no god at all who know come ana let us
be go if we would reach that camp er dark
so we descend from the ridg and reenter the chariot drove on
toward the neck of the pass now thi neck wa veri narrow not more
than four pace wide for a certain distanc and on either side of
the roadwai were tumbl sandston boulder between which grew desert
plant and gulli that had been cut by stormwat while beyond these
rose the side of the mountain here the hors went at a walk toward a
turn in the path at which point the land began to fall again
when we were about half a spear throw from thi turn of a sudden i
heard a sound and glanc to the right perceiv a woman leap down
the hillsid toward us the chariot saw also and halt the hors
and the two runner guard turn and drew their sword in less than
half a minut the woman had reach us come out of the shadow so that
the light fell upon her face
merapi exclaim the princ and i speak as though with on
breath
merapi it wa inde but in evil case her long hair had broken loos
and fell about her the cloak she wore wa torn and there were blood
and foam upon her lip she stood gasp sinc speak she could not for
breathless support herself with on hand upon the side of the
chariot and with the other point to the bend in the road at last a
word came on onli it wa
murder
she mean that she is go to be murder said the princ to me
no she pant youyou the hebrew go back
turn the hors i cri to the chariot
he began to obei help by the two guard but becaus of the narrow
of the road and the steep of the bank thi wa not easi inde
thei were but half round in such fashion that thei block the pathwai
from side to side when a wild yell of jahveh broke upon our ear
and from round the bend a few pace awai rush a hord of fierc
hooknos men brandish knive and sword scarc wa there time
for us to leap behind the shelter of the chariot and make readi when
thei were on us
hearken i said to the chariot as thei came run as you never ran
befor and bring up the guard behind
he sprang awai like an arrow
get back ladi cri seti thi is no woman work and see here
come laban to seek you and he point with hi sword at the leader of
the murder
she obei stagger a few pace to a stone at the roadsid behind
which she crouch afterward she told me that she had no strength to
go further and inde no will sinc if we were kill it were better
that she who had warn us should be kill also
now thei had reach us the whole flood of them thirti or forti men
the first who came stab the frighten hors and down thei went
against the bank struggl on the chariot leapt the hebrew seek
to come at us and we met them as best we might tear off our cloak
and throw them over our left arm to serv as shield
oh what a fight wa that in the open or had we not been prepar we
must have been slain at onc but as it wa the place and the barrier
of the chariot gave us some advantag so narrow wa the roadwai the
wall of which were here too steep to climb that not more than four of
the hebrew could strike at us at onc which four must first surmount
the chariot or the still live hors
but we also were four and thank to userti two of us were clad in mail
beneath our robesfour strong men fight for their live against us
came four of the hebrew on leapt from the chariot straight at seti
who receiv him upon the point of hi iron sword whereof i heard the
hilt ring against hi breastbon that same famou iron sword which
todai li buri with him in hi grave
down he came dead throw the princ to the ground by the weight of
hi bodi the hebrew who attack me caught hi foot on the chariot
pole and fell forward so i kill him easili with a blow upon the head
which gave me time to drag the princ to hi feet again befor anoth
follow the two guard also sturdi fighter both of them kill or
mortal wound their men but other were press behind so thick and
fast that i could keep no count of all that happen afterward
present i saw on of the guard fall slain by laban a stab on the
breast sent me reel backward had it not been for that mail i wa
sped the other guard kill him who would have kill me and then
himself wa kill by two who came on him at onc
now onli the princ and i were left fight back to back he close
with on man a veri great fellow and wound him on the hand so that
he drop hi sword thi man grip him round the middl and thei
roll togeth on the ground laban appear and stab the princ in
the back but the curv knife he wa us snap on the syrian mail
i struck at laban and wound him on the head daze him so that he
stagger back and seem to fall over the chariot then other rush
at me and but for userti armour three time at least i must have
di fight madli i stagger against the rock and whilst wait
for a new onset saw that seti hurt by laban thrust wa now beneath
the great hebrew who had him by the throat and wa choke the life out
of him
i saw someth els alsoa woman hold a sword with both hand and
stab downward after which the grip of the hebrew loosen from
seti throat
traitress cri on and struck at her so that she reel back hurt
then when all seem finish and beneath the rain of blow my sens
were fail i heard the thunder of hors hoof and the shout of
egypt egypt from the throat of soldier the flash of bronz
caught my daze ey and with the roar of battl in my ear i seem to
fall asleep just as the light of dai depart
chapter viii
seti counsel pharaoh
dream upon dream dream of voic dream of face dream of sunlight
and of moonlight and of myself be born forward alwai forward
dream of shout crowd and abov all dream of merapi ey
look down on me like two watch star from heaven then at last the
awaken and with it throb of pain and qualm of sick
at first i thought that i wa dead and ly in a tomb then by degre
i saw that i wa in no tomb but in a darken room that wa familiar
to me my own room in seti palac at tani it must be so for
there near to the bed on which i lai wa my own chest fill with the
manuscript that i had brought from memphi i tri to lift my left
hand but could not and look down saw that the arm wa bandag like
to that of a mummi which made me think again that i must be dead if
the dead could suffer so much pain i close my ey and thought or
slept a while
as i lai thu i heard voic on of them seem to be that of a
physician who said ye he will live and er long recov the blow
upon the head which ha made him senseless for so mani dai wa the
worst of hi wound but the bone wa but bruis not shatter or
driven in upon the brain the flesh cut on hi arm ar heal well
and the mail he wore protect hi vital from be pierc
i am glad physician answer a voic that i knew to be that of
userti sinc without a doubt had it not been for ana hi high
would have perish it is strang that on whom i thought to be noth
but a dream scribe should have shown himself so brave a warrior the
princ sai that thi ana kill three of those dog with hi own hand
and wound other
it wa well done your high answer the physician but still
better wa hi forethought in provid a rearguard and in despatch
the chariot to call it up it seem to have been the hebrew ladi who
realli save the life of hi high when forget her sex she
stab the murder who had him by the throat
that is the princ tale or so i understand she answer coldli
yet it seem strang that a weak and wornout girl could have pierc a
giant through from back to breast
at least she warn him of the ambush your high
so thei sai perhap ana here will soon tell us the truth about these
matter tend him well physician and you shall not lack for your
reward
then thei went awai still talk and i lai quiet fill with
thank and wonder for now everyth came back to me
a while later as i lai with my ey still shut for even that low light
seem to hurt them i becam awar of a woman soft step steal
round my bed and of a fragranc such as come from a woman robe and
hair i look and saw merapi starlik ey gaze down on me just as
i had seen them in my dream
greet moon of israel i said of a truth we meet again in strang
case
oh she whisper ar you awak at last i thank god scribe ana
who for three dai thought that you must die
as had it not been for you ladi sure i should have donei and
anoth now it seem that all three of us will live
would that but two live the princ and you ana would that i had
di she answer sigh heavili
why
cannot you guess becaus i am outcast who ha betrai my peopl
becaus their blood flow between me and them for i kill that
man and he wa my own kinsman for the sake of an egyptiani mean
egyptian therefor the curs of jahveh is on me and as my kinsman
di doubtless i shall die in a dai to come and afterwardswhat
afterward peac and great reward if there be justic in earth or
heaven o most nobl among women
would that i could think so hush i hear step drink thi i am the
chief of your nurs scribe ana an honour post sinc todai all
egypt love and prais you
sure it is you ladi merapi whom all egypt should love and prais
i answer
then the princ seti enter i strove to salut him by lift my less
injur arm but he caught my hand and press it tenderli
hail to you belov of menthu god of war he said with hi pleasant
laugh i thought i had hire a scribe and lo in thi scribe i find a
soldier who might be an armi boast
at thi moment he caught sight of merapi who had move back into the
shadow
hail to you also moon of israel he said bow if i name ana here
a warrior of the best what name can both of us find for you to whom we
ow our live nai look not down but answer
princ of egypt she repli confusedli i did but littl the plot
came to my ear through jabez my uncl and i fled awai and know
the short path from childhood wa just in time had i stai to think
perchanc i should not have dare
and what of the rest ladi what of the hebrew who wa choke me and
of a certain sword thrust that loos hi hand for ever
of that your high i can recal noth or veri littl then
doubtless rememb what she had just said to me she made obeis
and pass from the chamber
she can tell falsehood as sweetli as she doe all els said seti
when he had watch her go oh what a woman have we here ana perfect
in beauti perfect in courag perfect in mind where ar her fault i
wonder let it be your part to search them out sinc i find none
ask them of ki o princ he is a veri great magician so great that
perhap hi art mai even avail to discov what a woman seek to hide
also you mai rememb that he gave you certain warn befor we
journei to goshen
yesh told me that my life would be in danger as certainli it wa
there he wa right he told me also that i should see a woman whom i
should come to love there he wa wrong i have seen no such woman oh
i know well what is pass in your mind becaus i hold the ladi merapi
to be beauti and brave you think that i love her but it is not so
i love no woman except of cours her high ana you judg me by
yourself
ki said come to love princ there is yet time
not so ana if on love on love at onc soon i shall be old and
she will be fat and ugli and how can on love then get well quickli
ana for i wish you to help me with my report to pharaoh i shall tell
him that i think these israelit ar much oppress and that he should
make them amend and let them go
what will pharaoh sai to that after thei have just tri to kill hi
heir
i think pharaoh will be angri and so will the peopl of egypt who do
not reason well he will not see that believ what thei do laban
and hi band were right to try to kill me who howev unwittingli
desecr the sanctuari of their god had thei done otherwis thei
would have been no good hebrew and for my part i cannot bear them
malic yet all egypt is afir about thi busi and cri out that
the israelit should be destroi
it seem to me princ that whatev mai be the case with ki second
propheci hi third is in the wai of fulfilmentnam that thi
journei to goshen mai caus you to risk your throne
he shrug hi shoulder and answer
not even for that ana will i sai to pharaoh what is not in my mind
but let that matter be till you ar stronger
what chanc at the end of the fight princ and how came i here
the guard kill most of the hebrew who remain aliv some few fled
and escap in the dark among them laban their leader although you
had wound him and six were taken aliv thei await their trial i wa
but littl hurt and you whom we thought dead were but senseless and
senseless or wander you have remain till thi hour we carri you
in a litter and here you have been these three dai
and the ladi merapi
we set her in a chariot and brought her to the citi sinc had we left
her she would certainli have been murder by her peopl when pharaoh
heard what she had done as i did not think it well that she should
dwell here he gave her the small hous in thi garden that she might
be guard and with it slave women to attend upon her so there she
dwell have the freedom of the palac and all the while ha fill
the offic of your nurs
at thi moment i grew faint and shut my ey when i open them again
the princ had gone six more dai went by befor i wa allow to leav
my bed and dure thi time i saw much of merapi she wa veri sad and
live in fear of be kill by the hebrew also she wa troubl in
her heart becaus she thought she had betrai her faith and peopl
at least you ar rid of laban i said
never shall i be rid of him while we both live she answer i
belong to him and he will not loos my bond becaus hi heart is set on
me
and is your heart set on him i ask
her beauti ey fill with tear
a woman mai not have a heart oh ana i am unhappi she answer and
went awai
also i saw other the princess came to visit me she thank me much
becaus i had fulfil my promis to her and guard the princ
moreov she brought me a gift of gold from pharaoh and other gift of
fine raiment from herself she question me close about merapi of
whom i could see she wa alreadi jealou and wa glad when she learn
that she wa affianc to a hebrew old bakenkhonsu came too and ask
me mani thing about the princ the hebrew and merapi especi
merapi of whose deed he said all egypt wa talk question that i
answer as best i could
here we have that woman of whom ki told us he said she who shall
bring so much joi and so much sorrow to the princ of egypt
why so i ask he ha not taken her into hi hous nor do i think
that he mean to do so
yet he will ana whether he mean it or not for hi sake she betrai
her peopl which among the israelit is a deadli crime twice she
save hi life onc by warn him of the ambush and again by stab
with her own hand on of her kinsmen who wa murder him is it not
so tell me you were there
it is so but what then
thi that whatev she mai sai she love him unless inde it is
you whom she love and he look at me shrewdli
when a woman ha a princ and such a princ to her hand would she
troubl herself to set snare to catch a scribe i ask with some
bitter
oho he said with on of hi great laugh so thing stand thu do
thei well i thought it but friend ana be warn in time do not try
to conjur down the moon to be your household lamp lest she should set
and the sun her lord should grow wroth and burn you up well she
love him and therefor soon or late she will make him love her be
what she is
how bakenkhonsu
with most men ana it would be simpl a sigh some halfhidden tear
at the right moment and the thing is done as i have known it done a
thousand time but thi princ be what he is it mai be otherwis
she mai show him that her name is gone from him that becaus of him she
is hate by her peopl and reject by her god and thu stir hi piti
which is love own sister or mayhap be also as i am told wise
she will give him counsel as to all these matter of the israelit and
thu creep into hi heart under the guis of friendship and then her
sweet and her beauti will do the rest in natur wai at least by
thi road or by that upstream or downstream thither she will come
if so what of it it is the custom of the king of egypt to have more
wive than on
thi ana seti i think is a man who in truth will have but on and
that on will be thi hebrew ye a hebrew woman will rule egypt and
turn him to the worship of her god for never will she worship our
inde when thei see that she is lost to them her peopl will us her
thu or perchanc her god himself will us her to fulfil hi purpos
as alreadi he mai have us her
and afterward bakenkhonsu
afterwardswho know i am not a magician at least not on of ani
account ask it of ki but i am veri veri old and i have watch the
world and i tell you that these thing will happen unless and he
paus
unless what
he drop hi voic
unless userti is bolder than i think and kill her first or better
still procur some hebrew to kill hersai that castoff lover
of her if you would be a friend to pharaoh and to egypt you might
whisper it in her ear ana
never i answer angrili
i did not think you would ana who also struggl in thi net of
moonbeam that is stronger and more real than ani twist out of palm
or flax well nor will i who in my ag love to watch such human sport
and be so near to them fear to thwart the scheme of god let thi
scroll unrol itself as it will and when it is open read it ana and
rememb what i said to you thi dai it will be a pretti tale written
at the end with blood for ink oho ohoho and laugh he hobbl
from the room leav me frighten
moreov the princ visit me everi dai and even befor i left my bed
began to dictat to me hi report to pharaoh sinc he would emploi no
other scribe the substanc of it wa what he had foreshadow name
that the peopl of israel have suffer much for gener at
the hand of the egyptian should now be allow to depart as their
prophet demand and go whither thei would unharm of the attack
upon us in the pass he made light sai it wa the evil work of a few
zealot wrought on by fanci insult to their god a deed for which the
whole peopl should not be call upon to suffer the last word of the
report were
rememb o pharaoh i prai thee that amon god of the egyptian
and jahveh the god of the israelit cannot rule togeth in the same
land if both abid in egypt there will be a war of the god wherein
mortal mai be ground to dust therefor i prai thee let israel go
after i had risen and wa recov i copi out thi report in my
fairest write refus to tell ani of it purport although all
ask among them the vizier nehesi who offer me a bribe to disclos
it secret thi came to the ear of seti i know not how and he wa
much pleas with me about the matter sai he rejoic to find that
there wa on scribe in egypt who could not be bought userti also
question me and when i refus to answer strang to sai wa not
angri becaus she declar i onli did my duti
at last the roll wa finish and seal and the princ with hi own
hand but without speak laid it on the knee of pharaoh at a public
court for thi he would trust no on els to do amenmes also brought
up hi report as did nehesi the vizier and the captain of the guard
which save us from death eight dai later the princ wa summon to a
great council of state as were all other of the royal hous togeth
with the high offic i too receiv a summon as on who had been
concern in these matter
the princ accompani by the princess drove to the palac in
pharaoh golden chariot drawn by two milkwhit hors of the blood of
those famou steed that had save the life of the great rames in the
syrian war all down the street that were fill with thousand of the
peopl thei were receiv with shout of welcom
see said the old councillor bakenkhonsu who wa my companion in a
second chariot egypt is proud and glad it thought that it princ wa
but a dreamer of dream but now it ha heard the tale of the ambush in
the pass and learn that he is a man of war a warrior who can fight
with the best therefor it love him and rejoic
then by the same rule bakenkhonsu a butcher should be more great
than the wisest of scribe
so he is ana especi if the butcher be on of men the writer
creat but the slayer kill and in a world rule of death he who
kill ha more honour than he who creat hearken now thei ar
shout out your name is that becaus you ar the author of certain
write i tell you no it is becaus you kill three men yonder in
the pass if you would becom famou and belov ana ceas from the
write of book and take to the cut of throat
yet the writer still live when he is dead
oho laugh bakenkhonsu you ar even more foolish than i thought
how is a man advantag by what happen when he is dead why todai
that blind beggar whine on the templ step mean more to egypt than
all the mummi of all the pharaoh unless thei can be rob take
what life can give you ana and do not troubl about the offer
which ar laid in the tomb for time to crumbl
that is a mean faith bakenkhonsu
veri mean ana like all els that we can tast and handl a mean
faith suit to mean heart among whom should be reckon all save on
in everi thousand yet if you would prosper follow it and when you
ar dead i will come and laugh upon your grave and sai here li on
of whom i had hope higher thing as i hope them of your master
and not in vain bakenkhonsu whatev mai happen to the servant
that we shall learn and er long i think i wonder who will ride at
hi side befor the next nile flood by then perchanc he will have
chang pharaoh golden chariot for an oxcart and you will goad the
oxen and talk to him of the starsor mayhap of the moon well you
might both be happier thu and she of the moon is a jealou goddess who
love worship ohoho here ar the palac step help me to descend
priest of the ladi of the moon
we enter the palac and were led through the great hall to a smaller
chamber where pharaoh who did not wear hi robe of state await us
seat in a cedar chair glanc at him i saw that hi face wa stern
and troubl also it seem to me that he had grown older the princ
and princess made obeis to him as did we lesser folk but he took
no heed when all were present and the door had been shut pharaoh
said
i have read your report son seti concern your visit to the
israelit and all that chanc to you and also the report of you
nephew amenmes and of you offic who accompani the princ of
egypt befor i speak of them let the scribe ana who wa the chariot
companion of hi high when the hebrew attack him stand forward
and tell me all that pass
so i advanc and with bow head repeat that tale onli leav
out so far as wa possibl ani mention of myself when i had finish
pharaoh said
he who speak but half the truth is sometim more mischiev than a
liar did you then sit in the chariot scribe do noth while the
princ battl for hi life or did you run awai speak seti and sai
what part thi man plai for good or ill
then the princ told of my share in the fight with word that brought
the blood to my brow he told also how that it wa i who take the
risk of hi wrath had order the guard of twenti men to follow us
unseen had disguis two season soldier as chariot runner and had
thought to send back the driver to summon help at the commenc of
the frai how i had been hurt also and wa but late recov when
he had finish pharaoh said
that thi stori is true i know from other scribe you have done
well but for you todai hi high would lie upon the tabl of the
embalm as inde for hi folli he deserv to do and egypt would
mourn from thebe to the mouth of nile come hither
i came with trembl step and knelt befor hi majesti around hi
neck hung a beauteou chain of wrought gold he took it and cast it
over my head sai
becaus you have shown yourself both brave and wise with thi gold i
give you the titl of councillor and king companion and the right
to inscrib the same upon your funer stele let it be note retir
scribe ana councillor and king companion
so i withdrew confus and as i pass seti he whisper in my ear
i prai you my lord do not ceas to be princ companion becaus you
have becom that of the king
then pharaoh order that the captain of the guard should be advanc
in rank and that gift should be given to each of the soldier and
provis be made for the children of those who had been kill with
doubl allow to the famili of the two men whom i had disguis as
runner
thi done onc more pharaoh spoke slowli and with much mean have
first order that all attend and guard should leav the chamber i
wa about to go also but old bakenkhonsu caught me by the robe sai
that in my new rank of councillor i had the right to remain
princ seti he said after all that i have heard i find thi report
of your strang read moreov the tenor of it is differ inde
to that of those of the count amenmes and the offic you counsel me
to let these israelit go where thei will becaus of certain hardship
that thei have suffer in the past which hardship howev have left
them mani and rich that counsel i am not mind to take rather am i
mind to send an armi to the land of goshen with order to despatch
thi peopl who conspir to murder the princ of egypt through the
gatewai of the west there to worship their god in heaven or in hell
ay to slai them all from the greybeard down to the suckl at the
breast
i hear pharaoh said seti quietli
such is my will went on meneptah and those who accompani you upon
your busi and all my councillor think as i do for truli egypt
cannot bear so hideou a treason yet accord to our law and custom
it is need befor such great act of war and polici ar undertaken
that he who stand next to the throne and is destin to fill it
should give consent thereto do you consent princ of egypt
i do not consent pharaoh i think it would be a wick deed that ten
of thousand should be massacr for the reason that a few fool waylaid
a man who chanc to be of royal blood becaus by inadvert he had
desecr their sanctuari
now i saw that thi answer made pharaoh wroth for never befor had hi
will been cross in such a fashion still he control himself and
ask
do you then consent princ to a gentler sentenc name that the
hebrew peopl should be broken up that the more danger of them
should be sent to labour in the desert mine and quarri and the rest
distribut throughout egypt there to live as slave

chapter ix
the smite of amon
that even i sat ill at eas in my workchamb in seti palac
make pretenc to write i who felt that great evil threaten my
lord the princ and knew not what to do to turn them from him the door
open and old pambasa the chamberlain appear and address me by my
new titl sai that the hebrew ladi merapi who had been my nurs in
sick wish to speak with me present she came and stood befor
me
scribe ana she said i have but just seen my uncl jabez who ha
come or been sent with a messag to me and she hesit
why wa he sent ladi to bring you new of laban
not so laban ha fled awai and none know where he is and jabez ha
onli escap much troubl as the uncl of a traitress by undertak
thi mission
what is the mission
to prai me if i would save myself from death and the vengeanc of god
to work upon the heart of hi high which i know not how to do
yet i think you might find mean merapi
save through you hi friend and counsellor she went on turn
awai her face jabez ha learn that it is in the mind of pharaoh
utterli to destroi the peopl of israel
how doe he know that merapi
i cannot sai but i think all the hebrew know i knew it myself though
none had told me he ha learn also that thi cannot be done under the
law of egypt unless the princ who is heir to the throne and of full ag
consent now i am come to prai you to prai the princ not to consent
why not prai to the princ yourself merapi i began when from
the shadow behind me i heard the voic of seti who had enter by the
privat door bear some write in hi hand sai
and what prayer ha the ladi merapi to make to me nai rise and speak
moon of israel
o princ she plead my prayer is that you will save the hebrew
from death by the sword as you alon have the power to do
at thi moment the door open and in swept the royal userti
what doe thi woman here she ask
i think that she came to see ana wife as i did and as doubtless you
do also be here she prai me to save her peopl from the sword
and i prai you husband to give her peopl to the sword which thei
have earn who would have murder you
and been paid everyon of them userti unless some still linger
beneath the rod he ad with a shudder the rest ar innocentwhi
should thei die
becaus your throne hang upon it seti i sai that if you continu to
thwart the will of pharaoh as by the law of egypt you can do he will
disinherit you and set your cousin amenmes in your place as by the
law of egypt he can do
i thought it userti yet why should i turn my back upon the right over
a matter of my privat fortun the question isi it the right
she stare at him in amaz she who never understood seti and could
not dream that he would throw awai the greatest throne in all the world
to save a subject peopl mere becaus he thought that thei should
not die still warn by some instinct she left the first question
unansw deal onli with the second
it is the right she said for mani reason whereof i need give but
on for in it lie all the other the god of egypt ar the true god
whom we must serv and obei or perish here and hereaft the god of
the israelit is a fals god and those who worship him ar heret and
by their heresi under sentenc of death therefor it is most right
that those whom the true god have condemn should die by the sword of
their servant
that is well argu userti and if it be so mayhap my mind will
becom as your in thi matter so that i shall no longer stand between
pharaoh and hi desir but is it so there the problem i will not
ask you why you sai that the god of the egyptian ar the true god
becaus i know what you would answer or rather that you could give no
answer but i will ask thi ladi whether her god is a fals god and if
she repli that he is not i will ask her to prove thi to me if
she can if she is abl to prove it then i think that what i said to
pharaoh todai i shall repeat three dai henc if she is not abl to
prove it then i shall consid veri earnestli of the matter answer
now moon of israel rememb that mani thousand of live mai hang
on what you sai
o your high began merapi then she paus clasp her hand and
look upward i think that she wa prai for her lip move as she
stood thu i saw and i think seti saw also a veri wonder light grow
on her face and gather in her ey a kind of divin fire of inspir
and resolv
how can i a poor hebrew maiden prove to your high that my god is
the true god and that the god of egypt ar fals god i know not and
yet is there ani on god among all the mani whom you worship whom you
ar prepar to set up against him
of a sureti israelit answer userti there is amonra father of
the god of whom all other god have their be and from whom thei
draw their strength yonder hi statu sit in the sanctuari of hi
ancient templ let your god stir him from hi place but what will you
bring forward against the majesti of amonra
my god ha no statu princess and hi place is in the heart of
men or so i have been taught by hi prophet i have noth to bring
forward in thi war save that which must be offer in all warsmi
life
what do you mean ask seti astound
i mean that i unfriend and alon will enter the presenc of amonra
in hi chosen sanctuari and in the name of my god will challeng him to
kill me if he can
we stare at her and userti exclaim
if he can hearken now to thi blasphem and do you seti accept her
challeng as hereditari highpriest of the god amon let her life pai
forfeit for her sacrileg
and if the great god amon cannot or doe not deign to kill you ladi
how will that prove that your god is greater than he ask the princ
perhap he might smile and in hi piti let the insult pass as your
god did by me
thu it shall be prove your high if naught happen to me or if
i am protect from anyth that doe happen then i will dare to call
upon my god to work a sign and a wonder and to humbl amonra befor
your ey
and if your god should also smile and let the matter pass ladi as he
did by me the other dai when hi priest call upon him what shall we
have learn as to hi strength or as to that of amonra
o princ you will have learn noth yet if i escap from the wrath
of amon and my god is deaf to my prayer then i am readi to be deliv
over into the hand of the priest of amon that thei mai aveng my
sacrileg upon me
there speak a great heart said seti yet i am not mind that
thi ladi should set her life upon such an issu i do not believ that
either the highgod of egypt or the god of the israelit will stir but
i am quit sure that the priest of amon will aveng the sacrileg and
that cruelli enough the dice ar load against you ladi you shall
not prove your faith with blood
why not ask userti what is thi girl to you seti that you
should stand between her and the fruit of her wicked you who at
least in name ar the highpriest of the god whom she blasphem and who
wear hi robe at templ feast she believ in her god leav it to
her god to help her as she ha dare to sai he will
you believ in amon userti ar you prepar to stake your life
against her in thi contest
i am not so mad and vain seti as to believ that the god of all the
world will descend from heaven to save me at my prayer as thi impiou
girl pretend that she believ
you refus then ana what sai you who ar a loyal worshipp of
amon
i sai o princ that it would be presumptu of me to take preced
of hi highpriest in such a matter
seti smile and answer
and the highpriest sai that it would be presumptu of him to push
so far the prerog of a high offic which he never sought
your high broke in merapi in her honei plead voic i prai
you to be graciou to me and to suffer me to make thi trial which
i have sought i know not why word such as i have spoken cannot be
recal alreadi thei ar regist in the book of etern and soon
or late in thi wai or in that must be fulfil my life is stake
and i desir to learn at onc if it be forfeit
now even userti look on her with admir but answer onli
of a truth israelit i trust that thi courag will not forsak you
when you ar hand over to the merci of ki the sacrific of amon
and the priest in the vault of the templ you would profan
i also trust that it will not your high if such should be my
fate your word princ of egypt
seti look at her stand befor him so calmli with bow head and
hand cross upon her breast then he look at userti who wore a
mock smile upon her face she read the mean of that smile as i
did it wa that she did not believ that he would allow thi beauti
woman who had save hi life to risk her life for the sake of ani or
all the power of heaven or hell for a littl while he walk to and
fro about the chamber then he stop and said suddenli address not
merapi but userti
have your will rememb that if thi brave woman fail and di
her blood is on your hand and that if she triumph and live i shall
hold her to be on of the noblest of her sex and shall make studi of
all thi matter of religion moon of israel as titular highpriest of
amonra i accept your challeng on behalf of the god though whether
he will take note of it i do not know the trial shall be made
tomorrow night in the sanctuari of the templ at an hour that will be
commun to you i shall be present to make sure that you meet with
justic as will some other regist my command scribe ana and

merapi came to the princ
o highpriest of amon she said doe it pleas you to let me go for
i am veri weari
chapter x
the death of pharaoh
it wa the appoint dai and hour by command of the princ i drove with
him to the palac of pharaoh whither her high the princess refus
to be hi companion and for the first time we talk togeth of that
which had pass in the templ
have you seen the ladi merapi he ask of me
i answer no as i wa told that she wa sick within her hous and lai
ab suffer from weari or i knew not what
she doe well to keep there said seti i think that if she came out
those priest would murder her if thei could also there ar other
and he glanc back at the chariot that bore userti in state sai ana
can you interpret all thi matter
not i princ i thought that perhap your high the highpriest of
anon could give me light
the highpriest of amon wander in thick dark ki and the rest
swear that thi israelit is a sorceress who ha outmatch their magic
but to me it seem more simpl to believ that what she sai is true
that her god is greater than amon
and if thi be true princ what ar we to do who ar sworn to the
god of egypt
bow our head and fall with them i suppos ana sinc honour will not
suffer us to desert them
even if thei be fals princ
i do not think that thei ar fals ana though mayhap thei be less
true at least thei ar the god of the egyptian and we ar egyptian
he paus and glanc at the crowd street then ad see when i
pass thi wai three dai ago i wa receiv with shout of welcom by
the peopl now thei ar silent everi on
perhap thei have heard of what pass in the templ
doubtless but it is not that which troubl them who think that the
god can guard themselv thei have heard also that i would befriend
the hebrew whom thei hate and therefor thei begin to hate me why
should i complain when pharaoh show them the wai
princ i whisper what will you sai to pharaoh
that depend on what pharaoh sai to me ana if i will not desert our
god becaus thei seem to be the weaker though it should prove to my
advantag do you think that i would desert these hebrew becaus thei
seem to be weaker even to gain a throne
there great speak i murmur and as we descend from the
chariot he thank me with a look
we pass through the great hall to that same chamber where pharaoh had
given me the chain of gold alreadi he wa there seat at the head of
the chamber and wear on hi head the doubl crown about him were
gather all those of royal blood and the great offic of state we
made our obeis but of these he seem to take no note hi ey
were almost close and to me he look like a man who is veri ill
the princess userti enter after us and to her he spoke some word of
welcom give her hi hand to kiss then he order the door to be
close as he did so an offic of the household enter and said that
a messeng had come from the hebrew who desir speech with pharaoh
let him enter said meneptah and present he appear
he wa a wildei man of middl ag with long hair that fell over
hi sheepskin robe to me he look like a soothsay he stood befor
pharaoh make no salut
deliv your messag and be gone said nehesi the vizier
these ar the word of the father of israel spoken by my lip cri
the man in a voic that rang all round the vault chamber it ha come
to our ear o pharaoh that the woman merapi daughter of nathan who
ha refug in your citi she who is name moon of israel ha shown
herself to be a prophetess of power on to whom our god ha given

abl with the sword of prayer to smite the idol of amon to the dust we
demand that thi prophetess be restor to us make oath on our part
that she shall be given over safe to her betroth husband and that no
harm shall come to her for ani crime or treason she mai have commit
against her peopl
as to thi matter repli pharaoh quietli make your prayer to the
princ of egypt in whose household i understand the woman dwell if
it pleas him to surrend her who i take it is a witch or a cun
worker of trick to her betroth and her kindr let him do so it is
not for pharaoh to judg of the fate of privat slave
the man wheel round and address seti sai
you have heard son of the king will you deliv up thi woman

wall for safeti sake if it pleas her to go she can go if it
pleas her to remain she can remain when thi court is finish i
give you safeconduct to appear and in my presenc learn her pleasur

accord to our ancient law safe till the sun set you should be hewn
limb from limb awai with him and if he is found in thi citi after

then certain of the councillor sprang upon the man and thrust him forth
roughli at the door he wrench himself free and shout
think upon my word pharaoh befor thi sun ha set and you great
on of egypt think on them also befor it appear again
thei drove him out with blow and the door were shut onc more

pharaoh have your leav i tell you that i think you have done a
veri evil work thi dai on that is unpleas to those power which

bring upon egypt sorrow countless as the sand i believ that these
hebrew whom you unjustli seek to slai worship a god as great or greater
than our own and that thei and he will triumph over egypt i believ
also that the mighti heritag which you have taken from me will bring
neither joi nor honour to him by whom it ha been receiv
here amenmes start forward but meneptah held up hi hand and he
wa silent
i believ pharaohala that i must sai itthat your dai on
earth ar few and that for the last time we look on each other live
farewel pharaoh my father whom still i love mayhap more in thi hour
of part than ever i did befor farewel amenmes princ of egypt
take from me thi ornament which henceforth should be worn by you onli
and lift from hi headdress that royal circlet which mark the heir
to the throne he held it to amenmes who took it and with a smile of
triumph set it on hi brow

then though whether thi wa by chanc i cannot sai take no note of
the princess userti who gaze at him perplex and wrath seti drew
himself up and cri in the ancient form
life blood strength pharaoh pharaoh pharaoh and bow almost to
the ground
meneptah heard mutter beneath hi breath oh seti my son my most
belov son he stretch out hi arm as though to call him back or
perhap to clasp him as he did so i saw hi face chang next instant
he fell forward to the ground and lai there still all the compani stood
struck with horror onli the royal physician ran to him while roi and
other who were priest began to mutter prayer
ha the good god been gather to osiri ask amenmes present in
a hoars voic becaus if it be so i am pharaoh
nai amenmes exclaim userti the decre have not yet been
seal or promulg thei have neither strength nor weight
befor he could answer the physician cri
peac pharaoh still live hi heart beat thi is but a fit which
mai pass begon everi on he must have quiet
so we went but first seti knelt down and kiss hi father on the brow
an hour later the princess userti broke into the room of hi palac
where the princ and i were talk
seti she said pharaoh still live but the physician sai he will
be dead by dawn there is yet time here i have a write seal with
hi signet and wit wherein he recal all that he decre in the

that you ar crown nehesi and most of the offic ar on our side

none will move without your express command moreov no question will
be rais afterward sinc from thebe to the sea and throughout the
world you ar known to be the heir of egypt
what would you have me do wife ask seti when she paus for lack
of breath
cannot you guess must i put statecraft into your head as well as a
sword into your hand why that scribe of your who follow your heel

about him whom he can trust she leant forward and whisper fierc
kill the traitor amenmesesal will hold it a righteou act and the
gener wait your word shall i summon him
i think not answer seti becaus pharaoh as he ha a right to do
is pleas to name a certain man of royal blood to succe him how doe
thi make that man a traitor to pharaoh who still live but traitor or
none i will not murder my cousin amenmes
then he will murder you
mayb that is a matter between him and the god which i leav them to
settl the oath he swore todai is not on to be lightli broken but
whether he break it or not i also swore an oath at least in my heart
name that i would not attempt to disput the will of pharaoh whom
after all i love as my father and honour as my king pharaoh who
still live and mai as i hope recov what should i sai to him if he
recov or at the worst when at last we meet elsewher
pharaoh never will recov i have spoken to the physician and he
told me so alreadi thei pierc hi skull to let out the evil spirit of
sick after which none of our famili have live for veri long
becaus as i hold therebi whatev priest and physician mai sai

world in some few hour if inde you ar allow to live will be
noth but a privat citizen of egypt on at whom the veri beggar mai
spit and take no harm
sure wife moreov there is littl virtu in what i do sinc
on the whole i prefer that prospect and am will to take the risk of

gain of the moment for which you ar readi to pai in blood and
guess noth of what li beyond i am none of these thing except
perchanc the last i am onli a man who strive to be just and to do
right as right seem to me and if i dream it is of good not evil as
i understand good and evil you ar sure that thi dream of mine will
lead me to worldli loss and shame even of that i am not sure the
thought come to me that it mai lead me to those veri baubl on which
you set your heart but by a path strewn with spice and with flower
not by on pave with the bone of men and reek with their gore
crown that ar bought with the promis of blood and held with cruelti

she wave her hand i prai you keep the rest seti till i have more
time to listen moreov if i need propheci i think it better to turn

girl lost in fanci i must see to myself as while you live i cannot
reign alon or wage war in my own name onli i go to make term with
amenmes who will pai me high for peac

she drew herself to her full height look veri royal and answer
slowli
i do not return i the princess of egypt cannot live as the wife of
a common man who fall from a throne to set himself upon the earth and
smear hi own brow with mud for a uru crown when your propheci
come true seti and you crawl from your dust then perhap we mai speak

befor hi time and perchanc the hebrew sorceress who can give you
moonbeam to drink from those fals lip of her farewel seti onc a

farewel userti who i fear must still remain my sister
then he watch her go and turn to me said
todai ana i have lost both a crown and a wife yet strang to tell

that fortun turn or mayhap all the evil ar not done would you
not go also ana although she gibe at you in her anger the princess
think well of you and would keep you in her servic rememb whoever
fall in egypt she will be great till the last
oh princ i answer have i not born enough todai that you
must add insult to my load you with whom i broke the cup and swore the
oath
what he laugh is there on in egypt who rememb oath to hi
own loss i thank you ana and take my hand he press it
at that moment the door open and old pambasa enter sai
the hebrew woman merapi would see you also two hebrew men
admit them said seti note ana how yonder old timeserv turn
hi face from the set sun thi morn even it would have been to
see your high utter with bow so low that hi beard swept the
floor now it is to see you and not so much as an inclin of the
head in common courtesi thi moreov from on who ha rob me year
by year and grown fat on bribe it is the first of mani bitter lesson
or rather the secondthat of her high wa the first i prai that i
mai learn them with humil
while he muse thu and have no comfort to offer i listen sad at
heart merapi enter and a moment after her the wideei messeng
whom we had seen in pharaoh court and her uncl jabez the cun
merchant she bow low to seti and smile at me then the other two
appear and with small salut the messeng began to speak
you know my demand princ he said it is that thi woman should be
return to her peopl jabez her uncl will lead her awai
and you know my answer israelit answer seti it is that i have
no power over the come or the go of the ladi merapi or at least
wish to claim none address yourself to her
what is it you wish with me priest ask merapi quickli
that you should return to the town of goshen daughter of nathan have
you no ear to hear
i hear but if i return what will you of me
that you who have prove yourself a prophetess by your deed in yonder
templ should dedic your power to the servic of your peopl
receiv in return full forgiv for the evil you have wrought
against them which we swear to you in the name of god
i am no prophetess and i have wrought no evil against my peopl
priest i have onli save them from the evil of murder on who ha
shown himself their friend even as i hear to the lai down of hi
crown for their sake
that is for the father of israel and not for you to judg woman your
answer
it is neither for them nor for me but for god onli she paus then
ad is thi all you ask of me
it is all the father ask but laban ask hi affianc wife
and am i to be given in marriag tothi assassin
without doubt you ar to be given to thi brave soldier be alreadi
hi
and if i refus
then daughter of nathan it is my part to curs you in the name of
god and to declar you cut off and outcast from the peopl of god it
is my part to announc to you further that your life is forfeit and
that ani hebrew mai kill you when and how he can and take no blame
merapi pale a littl then turn to jabez ask
you have heard my uncl what sai you
jabez look round shiftili and said in hi unctuou voic
my niec sure you must obei the command of the elder of israel who
speak the will of heaven as you obei them when you match yourself
against the might of amon
you gave me a differ counsel yesterdai my uncl then you said i
had better bide where i wa
the messeng turn and glare at him
there is a great differ between yesterdai and todai went on
jabez hurriedli yesterdai you were protect by on who would soon
be pharaoh and might have been abl to move hi mind in favour of your
folk todai hi great is strip from him and hi will ha no
more weight in egypt a dead lion is not to be fear my niec
seti smile at thi insult but merapi face like my own grew red as
though with anger
sleep lion have been taken for dead er now my uncl as those who
would spurn them have discov to their cost princ seti have you no
word to help me in thi strait
what is the strait ladi if you wish to go to your peopl andto
laban who i understand is recov from hi hurt there is naught
between you and me save my gratitud to you which give me the right to
sai you shall not go if howev you wish to stai then perhap i am
still not so powerless to shield or smite as thi worthi jabez think
who still remain the greatest lord in egypt and on with those that love
him therefor should you desir to remain i think that you mai do so
unmolest of ani and least of all by that friend in whose shadow it
pleas you to sojourn
those ar veri gentl word murmur merapi word that few would
speak to a maid from whom naught is ask and who ha naught to give
a truce to thi talk snarl the messeng do you obei or do you
rebel your answer
she turn and look him full in the face sai
i do not return to goshen and to laban of whose sword i have seen
enough
mayhap you will see more of it befor all is done for the last time
think er the curs of your god and your peopl fall upon you and
after it death for fall i sai it shall i who as pharaoh know
todai am no fals prophet and as that princ know also
i do not think that my god who see the heart of those that he ha
made will aveng himself upon a woman becaus she refus to be wed
to a murder whom of her own will she never chose which priest is
the fate you offer me therefor i am content to leav judgment in
the hand of the great judg of all for the rest i defi you and your
command if i must be slaughter let me die but at least let me die
mistress of myself and free who am no man love or wife or slave
well spoken whisper seti to me
then thi priest becam terribl wave hi arm and roll hi wild
ey he pour out some hideou curs upon the head of thi poor maid
much of which as it wa spoken rapidli in an ancient form of hebrew
we did not understand he curs her live dy and after death
he curs her in her love and hate wed or alon he curs her in
childbear or in barren and he curs her children after her to
all gener lastli he declar her cut off from and reject by
the god she worship and sentenc her to death at the hand of ani
who could slai her so horribl wa that curs that she shrank awai
from him while jabez crouch about the ground hide hi ey with hi
hand and even i felt my blood turn cold
at length he paus foam at the lip then suddenli shout
after judgment doom he drew a knife from hi robe and sprang at her
she fled behind us he follow but seti cry ah i thought it
leapt between them as he did so draw the iron sword which he wore
with hi ceremoni dress at him he sprang and the next thing i saw wa
the red point of the sword stand out beyond the priest shoulder
down he fell babbl
is thi how you show your love for israel princ
it is how i show my hate of murder answer seti
then the man di
oh cri merapi wring her hand onc more i have caus hebrew
blood to flow and now all thi curs will fall on me
nai on me ladi if there is anyth in curs which i doubt for
thi deed wa mine and at the worst yonder mad brute knife did not
fall on you
ye life is left if onli for a littl while had it not been for you
princ by now i and she shudder
and had it not been for you moon of israel by now i and he
smile ad sure fate weav a strang web round you and me
first you save me from the sword then i save you i think ladi that
in the end we ought to die togeth and give ana here stuff for the best
of all hi stori friend jabez he went on to the israelit who wa
still crouch in the corner with the ey start from hi head get
you back to your gentleheart peopl and make it clear to them why the
ladi merapi cannot companion you take with you that carrion to prove
your tale tell them that if thei send more men to molest your niec a
like fate await them but that now as befor i do not turn my back upon
them becaus of the deed of a few madmen or evildo as i have given
them proof todai ana make readi sinc soon i leav for memphi
see that the ladi merapi who will travel alon ha fit escort for her
journei that is if it pleas her to depart from tani
chapter xi
the crown of amenmes
now notwithstand all the woe that fell on egypt and a certain
secret sorrow of my own began the happiest of the dai which the god
have given me we went to mennef or memphi the whitewal citi
where i wa born the citi that i love now no longer did i dwell in
a littl hous near to the enclosur of the templ of ptah which is
vaster and more splendid than all those of thebe or tani my home wa
in the beauti palac of seti which he had inherit from hi mother
the great royal wife it stood and inde still stand on a piledup
mound without the wall near to the templ of the goddess neit who
alwai ha her habit to the north of the wall why i do not know
becaus even her priest cannot tell me in front of thi palac
face to the north is a great portico whereof the roof is born upon
palmhead paint column whenc mai be seen the most love prospect
in egypt first the garden then the palmgrov then the cultiv
land then the broad and gentl nile and far awai the desert
here then we dwelt keep small state and almost unguard but in
wealth and comfort spend our time in the librari of the palac
or in those of the templ and when we weari of work in the love
garden or perchanc sail upon the bosom of the nile the ladi
merapi dwelt there also but in a separ wing of the palac with
certain slave and servant whom seti had given to her sometim we met
her in the garden where it pleas her to walk at the same hour that
we did name befor the sun grew hot or in the cool of the even
and now and again when the moon shone at night then the three of us
would talk togeth for seti never sought her compani alon or within
wall
those talk were veri pleasant moreov thei grew more frequent as time
went on sinc merapi had a thirst for learn and the princ would
bring her roll to read in a littl summerhous there wa here we
would sit or if the heat wa great outsid beneath the shadow of
two spread tree that stretch abov the roof of the littl
pleasurehous while seti discours of the content of the roll and
instruct her in the secret of our write sometim too i read
them stori of my make to which it pleas them both to listen or
so thei said and i in my vaniti believ also we would talk of the
mysteri and the wonder of the world and of the hebrew and their fate
or of what pass in egypt and the neighbour land
nor wa merapi altogeth lonesom see that there dwelt in memphi
certain ladi who had hebrew blood in their vein or were born of the
israelit and had marri egyptian against their law among these she
made friend and togeth thei worship in their own fashion with
none to sai them nai sinc here no priest were allow to troubl
them
for our part we held intercours with as mani as we pleas sinc few
forgot that seti wa by blood the princ of egypt that is a man almost
half divin and all were eager to visit him also he wa much belov
for hi own sake and more particularli by the poor whose want it wa
hi delight to reliev to the full limit of hi wealth thu it came
about that whenev he went abroad although against hi will he wa
receiv with honour and homag that were almost royal for though
pharaoh could rob him of the crown he could not empti hi vein of the
blood of king
it wa on thi account that i fear for hi safeti sinc i wa sure
that through hi spi amenmes knew all and would grow jealou of
a dethron princ who wa still so much ador by those over whom of
right he should have rule i told seti of my doubt and that when he
travel the street he should be guard by arm men but he onli
laugh and answer that as the hebrew had fail to kill him he did
not think that ani other would succe moreov he believ there
were no egyptian in the land who would lift a sword against him or put
poison in hi drink whoever bade them also he ad these word
the best wai to escap death is to have no fear of death for then
osiri shun us
now i must tell of the happen at tani pharaoh meneptah linger
but a few hour and never found hi mind again befor hi spirit flew
to heaven then there wa great mourn in the land for if he wa not
love meneptah wa honour and fear onli among the israelit there
wa open rejoic becaus he had been their enemi and their prophet
had foretold that death wa near to him thei gave it out that he had
been smitten of their god which caus the egyptian to hate them more
than ever there wa doubt too and bewilder in egypt for though
hi proclam disinherit the princ seti had been publish
abroad the peopl and especi those who dwelt in the south could
not understand why thi should have been done over a matter of the
shepherd slave who dwelt in goshen inde had the princ but held up
hi hand ten of thousand would have ralli to hi standard yet
thi he refus to do which astonish all the world who thought it
marvel that ani man should refus a throne which would have
lift him almost to the level of the god inde to avoid their
importun he had set out at onc for memphi and there remain
hidden awai dure the period of mourn for hi father so it came
about that amenmes succeed with none to sai him nai sinc without
her husband userti could not or would not act
after the dai of embalm were accomplish the bodi of pharaoh
meneptah wa carri up the nile to be laid in hi etern hous the
splendid tomb that he had made readi for himself in the vallei of dead
king at thebe to thi great ceremoni the princ seti wa not bidden
lest as bakenkhonsu told me afterward hi presenc should caus some
rise in hi favour with or without hi will for thi reason also the
dead god as he wa name wa not suffer to rest at memphi on hi
last journei up the nile disguis as a man of the peopl the princ
watch hi father bodi pass in the funer barg guard by shaven
whiterob priest the centr of a splendid process in front went
other barg fill with soldier and offic of state behind came
the new pharaoh and all the great on of egypt while the sound of
lament float far over the face of the water thei appear thei
pass thei disappear and when thei had vanish seti wept a littl
for in hi own fashion he love hi father
of what us is it to be a king and name halfdivin ana he said to
me see that the end of such god as these is the same as that of
the beggar at the gate
thi princ i answer that a king can do more good than a beggar
while the breath is in hi nostril and leav behind him a great
exampl to other
or more harm ana also the beggar can leav a great exampl that of
patienc in afflict still if i were sure that i should do noth
but good then perhap i would be a king but i have note that those
who desir to do the most good often work the greatest harm
which if follow out would be an argument for wish to do evil
princ
not so he answer becaus good triumph at the last for good is
truth and truth rule earth and heaven
then it is clear princ that you should seek to be a king
i will rememb the argument ana if ever time bring me an
opportun unstain by blood he answer
when the obsequi of pharaoh were finish amenmes return to
tani and there wa crown as pharaoh i attend thi great ceremoni
bear coron gift of certain royal ornament which the princ
sent to pharaoh sai it wa not fit that he as a privat person
should wear them ani longer these i present to pharaoh who took them
doubtfulli declar that he did not understand the princ seti mind
and action
thei hide no snare o pharaoh i said as you rejoic in the glori
that the god have sent you so the princ my master rejoic in the
rest and peac which the god have given him ask no more
it mai be so scribe but i find thi so strang a thing that
sometim i fear lest the rich flower of thi glori of mine should
hide some deadli snake whereof the princ know if he did not set it
there
i cannot sai o pharaoh but without doubt although he could work no
guil the princ is not as ar other men hi mind is both wide and
deep
too deep for me mutter amenmes nevertheless sai to my royal
cousin that i thank him for hi gift especi as some of them were
worn when he wa heir to egypt by my father khaemua who i would had
left me hi wisdom as well as hi blood sai to him also that while he
refrain from work me harm upon the throne as i know he ha done up
to the present he mai be sure that i will work him none in the station
which he ha chosen
also i saw the princess userti who question me close concern
her lord i told her everyth keep naught back she listen and
ask
what of that hebrew woman moon of israel without doubt she fill my
place
not so princess i answer the princ live alon neither she nor
ani other woman fill your place she is a friend to him no more
a friend well at least we know the end of such friendship oh
sure the princ must be stricken with mad from the god
it mai be so your high but i think that if the god smote more
men with such mad the world would be better than it is
the world is the world and the busi of those who ar born to
great is to rule it as it is not to hide awai amongst book and
flower and to talk folli with a beauti outland woman and a scribe
howev learn she answer bitterli ad oh if the princ
is not mad certainli he drive other to mad and me hi spous
among them that throne is hi hi yet he suffer a crossgrain dolt
to take hi place and send him gift and bless
i think your high should wait till the end of the stori befor you
judg of it
she look at me sharpli and ask
why do you sai that is the princ no fool after all do he and you
who both seem to be so simpl perchanc plai a great and hidden game
as i have known men feign folli in order to do with safeti or ha that
witch of an israelit some secret knowledg in which she instruct you
such as a woman who can shatter the statu of amon to fine dust might
well possess you make believ not to know which mean that you will
not answer oh scribe ana if onli it were safe i think i could find
a wai to wring the truth out of you although you do pretend to be but a
babe for innoc
it pleas your high to threaten and without caus
no she answer chang her voic and manner i do not threaten
it is onli the mad that i have caught from seti would you not be
mad if you knew that anoth woman wa to be crown tomorrow in your
place becausebecaus and she began to weep which frighten me
more than all her rough word
present she dri her tear and said
sai to my lord that i rejoic to hear that he is well and send him
greet but that never of my own wish will i look upon hi live
face again unless inde he take anoth counsel and set himself to
win that which is hi own sai to him that though he ha so littl care
for me and pai no heed to my desir still i watch over hi welfar
and hi safeti as best i mai
hi safeti princess pharaoh assur me not an hour ago that he had
naught to fear as inde he fear naught
oh which of you is the more foolish she exclaim stamp her foot
the man or hi master you believ that the princ ha naught to fear
becaus that usurp tell you so and he believ itwel becaus he
fear naught for a littl while he mai sleep in peac but let him wait
until troubl of thi sort or of that aris in egypt and understand
that the god send them on account of the great wicked that my
father wrought when death had him by the throat and hi mind wa
cloud the peopl begin to turn their ey toward their law king
then the usurp will grow jealou and if he ha hi wai the princ
will sleep in peacefor ever if hi throat remain uncut it will be
for on reason onli that i hold back the murder hand farewel i
can talk no more for i sai to you that my brain is afireand tomorrow
he should have been crown and i with him and she swept awai royal
as ever leav me wonder what she meant when she spoke of troubl
aris in egypt or if the word were but utter at hazard
afterward bakenkhonsu and i sup togeth at the colleg of the
templ of ptah of which becaus of hi ag he wa call the father
when i heard more of thi matter
ana he said i tell you that such gloom hang over egypt as i have
never known even when it wa thought that the ninebow barbarian would
conquer and enslav the land amenmes will be the fifth pharaoh whom
i have seen crown the first of them when i wa but a littl
child hang to my mother robe and not onc have i known such
joyless
that mai be becaus the crown pass to on who should not wear it
bakenkhonsu
he shook hi head not altogeth i think thi dark come from the
heaven as light doe men ar afraid thei know not of what
the israelit i suggest
now you ar near to it ana for doubtless thei have much to do with
the matter had it not been for them seti and not amenmes would be
crown tomorrow also the tale of the marvel which the beauti
hebrew woman wrought in the templ yonder ha got abroad and is taken as
an omen did i tell you that six dai gone a fine new statu of the god
wa consecr there and on the follow morn wa found ly on
it side or rather with it head rest on the breast of mut
if so merapi is blameless becaus she ha gone awai from thi citi
of cours she ha gone awai for ha not seti gone also but i think
she left someth behind her howev that mai be even our new divin
lord is afraid he dream ill ana he ad drop hi voic so
ill that he ha call in ki the kherheb to interpret hi vision
kherheb wa the titl of the chief offici magician
in ancient egypt
and what said ki
ki could sai noth or rather that the onli answer vouchsaf to
him and hi compani when thei made inquiri of their ka wa that
thi god reign would be veri short and that it and hi life would end
togeth
which perhap did not pleas the god amenmes bakenkhonsu
which did not pleas the god at all he threaten ki it is a foolish
thing to threaten a great magician ana as the kherheb ki himself
inde told him look him in the ey then he prai hi pardon and
ask who would succe him on the throne but ki said he did not know
as a kherheb who had been threaten could never rememb anyth
which inde he never canexcept to pai back the threaten
and did he know bakenkhonsu
by wai of answer the old councillor crumbl some bread fine upon the
tabl then with hi finger trace among the crumb the rough like
of a jackalhead god and of two feather after which with a swift
movement he swept the crumb onto the floor
seti i whisper read the hieroglyph of the princ name and
he nod and laugh in hi great fashion
men come to their own sometim ana especi if thei do not
seek their own he said but if so much must happen first that is
terribl the new pharaoh is not the onli man who dream ana of late
year my sleep ha been light and sometim i dream though i have no
magic like to that of ki
what did you dream
i dream of a great multitud march like locust over egypt befor
them went a column of fire in which were two hand on of these held
amon by the throat and on held the new pharaoh by the throat after
them came a column of cloud and in it a shape like to that of an
unwrap mummi a shape of death stand upon water that wa full of
countless dead
now i bethought me of the pictur that the princ and i had seen in
the ski yonder in the land of goshen but of it i said noth yet i
think that bakenkhonsu saw into my mind for he ask
do you never dream friend you see vision that come trueamenmes
on the throne for instanc do you not also dream at time no well
then the princ you look like men who might and the time is ripe
and pregnant oh i rememb you ar both of you dream not of the
pictur that pass across the terribl ey of ki but of those that the
moon reflect upon the water of memphi the moon of israel ana be
advis by me put awai the flesh and increas the spirit for in it
alon is happi whereof woman and all our joi ar but earthli
symbol shadow thrown by that mortal cloud which li between us and
the light abov i see that you understand becaus some of that light
ha struggl to your heart do you rememb that you saw it shine in
the hour when your littl daughter di ah i thought so it wa the
gift she left you a gift that will grow and grow in such a breast as
your if onli you will put awai the flesh and make room for it
ana man do not weeplaugh as i do ohoho give me my staff and
goodnight forget not that we sit togeth at the crown tomorrow
for you ar a king companion and that rank onc confer is on which
no new pharaoh can take awai it is like the gift of the spirit ana
which is hard to win but onc won more etern than the star oh why
do i live so long who would bath in it as when a child i us to bath
in nile
on the follow dai at the appoint hour i went to the great hall of
the palac that in which i had first seen meneptah and took my stand
in the place allot to me it wa somewhat far back perhap becaus
it wa not wish that i who wa known to be the privat scribe of
seti should remind egypt of him by appear where all could see me
great as wa the hall the crowd fill it to it furthest corner
moreov no common man wa present there but rather everi nobl and
headpriest in egypt and with them their wive and daughter so that
all the dim court shone with gold and preciou gem set upon festal
garment while i wa wait old bakenkhonsu hobbl toward me the
crowd make wai for him and i could see that there wa laughter in hi
sunken ey
we ar illplac ana he said still if ani of the mani god there
ar in egypt should chanc to rain fire on pharaoh we shall be the
safer talk of god he went on in a whisper have you heard what
happen an hour ago in the templ of ptah of tani whenc i have just
come pharaoh and all the bloodroyalsav onewalk accord to
custom befor the statu of the god which as you know should bow it
head to show that he choos and accept the king in front of amenmes
went the princess userti and as she pass the head of the god bow
for i saw it though all pretend that thei did not see then came
pharaoh and stood wait but it would not bow though the priest
call in the old formula the god greet the king
at length he went on look as black as night and other of the
blood of rames follow in their order last of all limp saptah and
behold the god bow again
how and why doe it do these thing i ask and at the wrong time
ask the priest ana or userti or saptah perhap the divin neck
ha not been oil of late or too much oil or too littl oil
or prayersor stringsmai have gone wrong or pharaoh mai have been
niggard in hi gift to that colleg of the great god of hi hous who
am i that i should know the wai of god that in the templ where i
serv at thebe fifti year ago did not pretend to bow or to troubl
himself as to which of the royal race sat upon the throne hush here
come pharaoh
then in a splendid process surround by princ councillor
ladi priest and guard amenmes and the royal wife urnur a
larg woman who walk awkwardli enter the hall a glitter band
the highpriest roi and the chancellor nehesi receiv pharaoh and
led him to hi throne the multitud prostrat itself trumpet blew
and thrice the old salut of life blood strength pharaoh pharaoh
pharaoh wa cri aloud
amenmes rose and bow and i saw that hi heavi face wa troubl and
look older then he swore some oath to god and men which roi dictat
to him and befor all the compani put on the doubl crown and the
other emblem and took in hi hand the scourg and golden sickl next
homag wa paid the princess userti came first and kiss pharaoh
hand but bent no knee inde first she spoke with him a while we
could not hear what wa said but afterward learn that she demand
that he should publicli repeat all the promis which her father
meneptah had made to her befor him confirm her in her place and
right thi in the end he did though it seem to me unwillingli
enough
so with mani form and ancient celebr the ceremoni went on till
all grew weari wait for that time when pharaoh should make hi speech
to the peopl that speech howev wa never made for present
thrust past us i saw those two prophet of the israelit who had
visit meneptah in thi same hall men shrank from them so that thei
walk straight up to the throne nor did even the guard strive to bar
their wai what thei said there i could not hear but i believ that
thei demand that their peopl should be allow to go to worship their
god in their own fashion and that amenmes refus as meneptah had
done
then on of them cast down a rod and it turn to a snake which hiss
at pharaoh whereon the kherheb ki and hi compani also cast down rod
that turn to snake though i could onli hear the hiss after thi
a great gloom fell upon the hall so that men could not see each other
face and everyon began to call aloud till the compani broke up in
confus bakenkhonsu and i were born togeth to the doorwai by the
pressur of the peopl whenc we were glad enough to see the sky again
thu end the crown of amenmes
chapter xii
the messag of jabez
that night there were none who rejoic in the street of the citi and
save in the palac and hous of those of the court none who feast i
walk abroad in the marketplac and note the peopl go to and fro
gloomili or talk togeth in whisper present a man whose face
wa hidden in a hood began to speak with me sai that he had a
messag for my master the princ seti i answer that i took no
messag from veil stranger whereon he threw back hi hood and i
saw that it wa jabez the uncl of merapi i ask him whether he had
obei the princ and born the bodi of that prophet back to goshen and
told the elder of the manner of the man death
ye he answer nor were the elder angri with the princ over thi
matter thei said that their messeng had exceed hi author sinc
thei had never told him to curs merapi and much less attempt to kill
her and that the princ did right to slai on who would have done
murder befor hi royal ey still thei ad that the curs have
onc been spoken by thi priest would sure fall upon merapi in thi
wai or in that
what then should she do jabez
i do not know scribe if she return to her peopl perchanc she
will be absolv but then she must sure marri laban it is for her to
judg
and what would you do if you were in her place jabez
i think that i should stai where i wa and make myself veri dear to
seti take the chanc that the curs mai pass her by sinc it wa not
lawfulli decre upon her whichev wai she look troubl wait and
at the worst a woman might wish to satisfi her heart befor it fall
especi if that heart should happen to turn to on who will be
pharaoh
why do you sai who will be pharaoh jabez i ask for we were
stand in an empti place alon
that i mai not tell you he repli cunningli yet it will come about
as i sai he who sit upon the throne is mad as meneptah wa mad
and will fight against a strength that is greater than hi until it
overwhelm him in the princ heart alon doe the light of wisdom
shine that which you saw todai is onli the first of mani miracl
scribe ana i can sai no more
what then is your messag jabez
thi becaus the princ ha striven to deal well with the peopl of
israel and for their sake ha cast asid a crown whatev mai chanc
to other let him fear noth no harm shall come to him or to those
about him such as yourself scribe ana who also would deal justli by
us yet it mai happen that through my niec merapi on whose head the
evil word ha fallen a great sorrow mai come to both him and her
therefor perhap although set thi against that she mai be wise
to stai in the hous of seti he on the balanc mai be wise to turn
her from hi door
what sorrow i ask who grew bewild with hi dark talk but
there wa no answer for he had gone
near to my lodg anoth man met me and the moonlight shine on hi
face show me the terribl ey of ki
scribe ana he said you leav for memphi tomorrow at the dawn and
not two dai henc as you purpos
how do you know that magician ki i answer for i had told my
chang of plan to none not even to bakenkhonsu have inde onli
determin upon it sinc jabez left me
i know noth ana save that a faith servant who ha learn all
you have learn todai will hurri to make report of it to hi master
especi if there is some other to whom he would also wish to make
report as bakenkhonsu think
bakenkhonsu talk too much whatev he mai think i exclaim
testili
the ag grow garrul you were at the crown todai were you
not
ye and if i saw aright from far awai those hebrew prophet seem
to worst you at your own trade there kherheb which must griev you as
you were griev in the templ when amon fell
it doe not griev me ana if i have power there mai be other who
have greater power as i learn in the templ of amon why therefor
should i feel asham
power i repli with a laugh for the string of my mind seem torn
that night would not craft be a better word how do you turn a stick
into a snake a thing which is imposs to man
craft might be a better word sinc craft mean knowledg as well as
trickeri imposs to man after what you saw a while ago in the
templ of amon do you hold that there is anyth imposs to man or
woman perhap you could do as much yourself
why do you mock me ki i studi book not snakecharm
he look at me in hi calm fashion as though he were read not my
face but the thought behind it then he look at the cedar wand in
hi hand and gave it to me sai
studi thi ana and tell me what is it
am i a child i answer angrili that i should not know a priest
rod when i see on
i think that you ar someth of a child ana he murmur all the
while keep those ey of hi fix upon my face
then a horror came about for the rod began to twist in my hand and
when i stare at it lo it wa a long yellow snake which i held by
the tail i threw the reptil down with a scream for it wa turn
it head as though to strike me and there in the dust it twist and
writh awai from me and toward ki yet an instant later it wa onli a
stick of yellow cedarwood though between me and ki there wa a snake
track in the sand
it is somewhat shameless of you ana said ki as he lift the wand
to reproach me with trickeri while you yourself try to confound a poor
juggler with such art as these
then i know not what i said to him save the end of it wa that i
suppos he would tell me next that i could fill a hall with dark at
noondai and cover a multitud with terror
let us have done with jest he said though these ar well enough in
their place will you take thi rod again and point it to the moon you
refus and you do well for neither you nor i can cover up her face
ana becaus you ar wise in your wai and consort with on who is wiser
and were present in the templ when the statu of amon wa shatter by
a certain witch who match her strength against mine and conquer me
i the great magician have come to ask youwhenc came that dark
in the hall todai
from god i think i answer in an aw whisper
so i think also ana but tell me or ask merapi moon of israel to
tell mefrom what god oh i sai to you that a terribl power is afoot
in thi land and that the princ seti did well to refus the throne of
egypt and to fly to memphi repeat it to him ana
then he too wa gone
now i return in safeti to memphi and told all these tide to the
princ who listen to them eagerli onc onli wa he greatli stir
it wa when i repeat to him the word of userti that never would she
look upon hi face again unless it pleas him to turn it toward the
throne on hear thi tear came into hi ey and rise he walk
up and down the chamber
the fallen must not look for gentl he said and doubtless ana
you think it folli that i should griev becaus i am thu desert
nai princ for i too have been abandon by a wife and the pain is
unforgotten
it is not of the wife i think ana sinc in truth her high is no
wife to me for whatev mai be the ancient law of egypt how could it
happen otherwis at ani rate in my case and her it is of the sister
for though my mother wa not her she and i were brought up togeth
and in our wai love each other though alwai it wa her pleasur to
lord it over me as it wa mine to submit and pai her back in jest
that is why she is so angri becaus now of a sudden i have thrown off
her rule to follow my own will wherebi she ha lost the throne
it ha alwai been the duti of the royal heiress of egypt to marri
the pharaoh of egypt princ and have wed on who would be pharaoh
accord to that duti the blow cut deep
then she had best thrust asid that foolish wife of hi and wed him who
is pharaoh but that she will never do amenmes she ha alwai hate
so much that she loath to be in the same place with him nor inde
would he wed her who wish to rule for himself not through a woman
whose titl to the crown is better than hi own well she ha put
me awai and there an end henceforth i must go lone
unlessunlesscontinu your stori friend it is kind of her in her
great to promis to protect on so humbl i should rememb that
although it is true that fallen head sometim rise again he ad
bitterli
so at least jabez think princ and i told him how the israelit
were sure that he would be pharaoh whereat he laugh and said
perhap for thei ar good prophet for my part i neither know or
care or mayb jabez see advantag in talk thu for as you know he
is a clever trader
i do not think so i answer and stop
had jabez more to sai of ani other matter ana of the ladi merapi for
instanc
now feel it to be my duti i told him everi word that had pass
between jabez and myself though somewhat shamefacedli
thi hebrew take much for grant ana even as to whom the moon of
israel would wish to shine upon why friend it might be you whom she
desir to touch with her light or some youth in goshennot labanor
no on
me princ me i exclaim
well ana i am sure you would have it so be advis by me and ask her
mind upon the matter look not so confus man for on who ha been
marri you ar too modest come tell me of thi crown
so glad enough to escap from the matter of merapi i spoke at length
of all that had happen when pharaoh amenmes took hi seat upon the
throne when i describ how the rod of the hebrew prophet had been
turn to a snake and how ki and hi compani had done likewis the
princ laugh and said that these were mere juggler trick but when
i told of the dark that had seem to gather in the hall and of
the gloom that fill the heart of all men and of the awesom dream of
bakenkhonsu also of the word of ki after he had cloud my mind and
plai hi jest upon me he listen with much earnest and answer
my mind is as ki in thi matter i too think that a terribl power is
afoot in egypt on that ha it home in the land of goshen and that i
did well to refus the throne but from what god these fortun come i
do not know perhap time will tell us meanwhil if there is aught in
the prophesi of these hebrew as interpret by jabez at least you
and i mai sleep in peac which is more than will chanc to pharaoh
on the throne that userti covet if so thi plai will be worth the
watch you have done your mission well ana go rest you while i
think over all that you have said
it wa even and as the palac wa veri hot i went into the garden and
make my wai to that littl pleasurehous where seti and i were wont
to studi i sat myself down there and be weari fell asleep when
i awok from a dream about some woman who wa weep night had fallen
and the full moon shone in the sky so that it rai fell on the garden
befor me
now in front of thi littl hous as i have said grew tree that at
thi season of the year were cover with white and cuplik blossom
and between these tree wa a seat built up of sundri brick on thi
seat sat a woman whom i knew from her shape to be merapi also she wa
sad for although her head wa bow and her long hair hid her face i
could hear her gentl sigh
the sight of her move me veri much and i rememb what the princ had
said to me tell me that i should do well to ask thi ladi whether
she had ani mind my wai therefor if i did so sure i could not be
blame yet i wa certain that it wa not to me that her heart turn
though to speak the truth much i wish it otherwis who would look
at the ibi in the swamp when the widewing eagl float in heaven
abov
an evil thought came into my mind sent by set suppos that thi
watcher ey were fix upon the eagl lord of the air suppos
that she worship thi eagl that she love it becaus it home wa
heaven becaus to her it wa the king of all the bird and suppos on
told her that if she lure it down to earth from the gloriou safeti of
the ski she would bring it to captiv or death at the hand of the
snarer then would not that love watcher sai let it go free and
happi howev much i long to look upon it and when it had sail from
sight perhap turn her ey to the humbl ibi in the mud
jabez had told me that if thi woman and the princ grew dear to each
other she would bring great sorrow on hi head if i repeat hi
word to her she who had faith in the propheci of her peopl would
certainli believ them moreov whatev her heart might prompt be
so highnatur never would she consent to do what might bring troubl
on seti head even if to refus him should sink her soul in sorrow
nor would she return to the hebrew there to fall into the hand of on
she hate then perhap i should i tell her if jabez had not meant
that the matter must be brought to her ear would he have spoken of
it at all in short wa it not my duti to her and perhap also to the
princ who therebi might be save from miseri to come that is if thi
talk of futur troubl were anyth more than an idl stori
such wa the evil reason with which set assail my spirit how i
beat it down i do not know not by my own good i am sure sinc at
the moment i wa aflam with love for the sweet and beauti ladi who
sat befor me and in my foolish would i think have given my life
to kiss her hand not altogeth for her sake either sinc passion
is veri selfish no i believ it wa becaus the love that i bore
the princ wa more deep and real than that which i could feel for ani
woman and i knew well that were she not in my sight no such treacheri
would have overcom my heart for i wa sure although he had never said
so to me that seti love merapi and abov all earthli thing desir
her as hi companion while if onc i spoke those word whatev my own
gain or loss and whatev her secret wish that she would never be
so i conquer though the victori left me trembl like a child and
wish that i had not been born to know the pang of love deni my
reward wa veri swift for just then merapi unfasten a gem from the
breast of her white robe and held it toward the moon as though to
studi it in an instant i knew it again it wa that royal scarab of
lapislazuli with which in goshen the princ had made fast the bandag
on her wound food which also had been snatch from her breast by
some power on that night when the statu of amon wa shatter in the
templ
long and earnestli she look at it then have glanc round to make
sure she wa alon she press it to her lip and kiss it thrice with
passion mutter i know not what between the kiss now the scale
fell from my ey and i knew that she love seti and oh how i thank
my guardian god who had save me from such useless shame
i wipe the cold damp from my brow and wa about to flee awai
discov myself with as few word as might be when look up i
saw stand behind merapi the figur of a man who wa watch her
replac the ornament in her robe while i hesit a moment the man
spoke and i knew the voic for that of seti then again i thought of
flight but be somewhat timid by natur fear to show myself until
it wa too late think that afterward the princ would make me the
target of hi wit so i sat close and still hear and see all
despit myself
what gem is that ladi which you admir and cherish so tenderli
ask seti in hi slow voic that so often hid a hint of laughter
she utter a littl scream and spring up saw him
oh my lord she exclaim pardon your servant i wa sit
here in the cool as you gave me leav to do and the moon wa so
brightthati wish to be see if by it i could read the write on
thi scarab
never befor thought i to myself did i know on who read with her
lip though it is true that first she us her ey
and could you ladi will you suffer me to try
veri slowli and colour so that even the moonlight show her
blush she withdrew the ornament again and held it toward him
sure thi is familiar to me have i not seen it befor he ask
perhap i wore it that night in the templ your high
you must not name me high ladi i have no longer ani rank in
egypt
i knowbecaus ofmi peopl oh it wa nobl
but about the scarabu he broke in with a wave of hi hand
sure it is the same with which the bandag wa made fast upon your
hurtoh year ago
ye it is the same she answer look down
i thought it and when i gave it to you i said some word that seem
to me well spoken at the time what were thei i cannot rememb have
you also forgotten
yesi meanno you said that now i had all egypt beneath my foot
speak of the royal cartouch upon the scarab
ah i recal how true and yet how fals the jest or propheci
how can anyth be both true and fals princ
that i could prove to you veri easili but it would take an hour or
more so it shall be for anoth time thi scarab is a poor thing
give it back to me and you shall have a better or would you choos thi
signet as i am no longer princ of egypt it is useless to me
keep the scarab princ it is your own but i will not take the ring
becaus it is
useless to me and you would not have that which is without valu
to the giver oh i string word ill but thei were not what i meant
no princ becaus your royal ring is too larg for on so small
how can you tell until you have tri also that is a fault which might
perhap be mend
then he laugh and she laugh also but as yet she did not take the
ring
have you seen ana he went on i believ he set out to search for
you in such a hurri inde that he could scarc finish hi report to
me
did he sai that
no he onli look it so much so that i suggest he should seek you
at onc he answer that he wa go to rest after hi long journei
or perhap i said that he ought to do so i forget as often on doe
on so beauteou a night when other thought seem nearer
why did ana wish to see me princ
how can i tell why doe a man who is still youngwant to see a sweet
and beauti ladi oh i rememb he had met your uncl at tani who
inquir as to your health perhap that is why he want to see you
i do not wish to hear about my uncl at tani he remind me of too
mani thing that give pain and there ar night when on wish to
escap pain which is sure to be found again on the morrow
ar you still of the same mind about return to your peopl he
ask more earnestli
sure oh do not sai that you will send me henc to
laban ladi
laban amongst other rememb princ that i am on under a curs if
i return to goshen in thi wai or in that soon i shall die
ana sai that your uncl jabez declar that the mad fellow who tri
to murder you had no author to curs and much less to kill you you
must ask him to tell you all
yet the curs will cling and crush me at the last how can i on
lone woman stand against the might of the peopl of israel and their
priest
ar you then lone
how can it be otherwis with an outcast princ
no it cannot be otherwis i know it who am also an outcast
at least there is her high your wife who doubtless will come to
comfort you she said look down
her high will not come if you had seen ana he would perhap have
told you that she ha sworn not to look upon my face again unless abov
it shine a crown
oh how can a woman be so cruel sure princ such a stab must cut
you to the heart she exclaim with a littl cry of piti
her high is not onli a woman she is a princess of egypt which is
differ for the rest it doe cut me to the heart that my royal sister
should have desert me for that which she love betterpow and
pomp but so it is unless ana dream it seem therefor that we ar in
the same case both outcast you and i is it not so
she made no answer but continu to look upon the ground and he went on
veri slowli
a thought come into my mind on which i would ask your judgment if two
who ar forlorn came togeth thei would be less forlorn by half would
thei not
it would seem so princethat is if thei remain forlorn at all but
i do not understand the riddl
yet you have answer it if you ar lone and i am lone apart we
should you sai be less lone togeth
princ she murmur shrink awai from him i spoke no such
word
no i spoke them for you hearken to me merapi thei think me a
strang man in egypt becaus i have held no woman dear never have
seen on whom i could hold dear here she look at him searchingli
and he went on a while ago befor i visit your land of goshenana
can tell you about the matter for i think he wrote it downki and
old bakenkhonsu came to see me now as you know ki is without doubt
a great magician though it would seem not so great as some of your
prophet he told me that he and other had been search out my futur
and that in goshen i should find a woman whom it wa fate i must love
he ad that thi woman would bring me much joi here seti paus
doubtless rememb thi wa not all that ki had said or jabez
either ki told me also he went on slowli that i had alreadi known
thi woman for thousand of year
she start and a strang look came into her face
how can that be princ
that is what i ask him and got no good answer still he said it
not onli of the woman but of my friend ana as well which inde would
explain much and it would appear that the other magician said it also
then i went to the land of goshen and there i saw a woman

here she sank upon the bench and cover her ey with her hand
and love her and felt as though i had love her for thousand of
year

israelit ar not law
some in thi citi and elsewher seem to find them so
and i am marri i mean perhap i am marriedat least in name

thi invis tie ha drawn us togeth out of the whole world and will
bind us togeth long after the world is dead it is not a matter of
what we wish to do merapi it is a matter of what fate ha decre we

togeth at memphi in egypt
chapter xiii
the red nile
on the morrow of thi night i found the princ alon for a littl while
and put him in mind of certain ancient manuscript that he wish to
read which could onli be consult at thebe where i might copi them
also of other that were said to be for sale there he answer that
thei could wait but i repli that the latter might find some other
purchas if i did not go at onc
you ar over fond of long journei upon my busi ana he said
then he consid me curious for a while and sinc he could read my
mind as inde i could hi saw that i knew all and ad in a gentl
voic
you should have done as i told you and spoken first if so who
know
you do princ i answer you and anoth
go and the god be with you friend but stai not too long copi
those roll which ani scribe can do i think there is troubl at hand
in egypt and i shall need you at my side anoth who hold you dear
will need you also
i thank my lord and that other i said bow and went
moreov while i wa make some humbl provis for my journei i
found that thi wa needless sinc a slave came to tell me that the
princ barg wa wait to sail with the wind so in that barg i
travel to thebe like a great nobl or a royal mummi be born
to burial onli instead of wail priest until i sent them back to
memphi musician sat upon the prow and when i will danc girl
came to amus my leisur and veil in golden net to serv at my
tabl
so i journei as though i were the princ himself and as on who wa
known to have hi ear wa made much of by the governor of the nome
the chief men of the town and the high priest of the templ at everi
citi where we moor for as i have said although amenmes sat
upon the throne seti still rule in the heart of the folk of egypt
moreov as i sail further up the nile to district where littl
wa known of the israelit and the troubl thei were bring on the
land i found thi to be so more and more why is it the great on
would whisper in my ear that hi high the princ seti doe not
hold hi father place then i would tell them of the hebrew and thei
would laugh and sai
let the princ unfurl hi royal banner here and we will show him what
we think of the question of these israelitish slave mai not the heir
of egypt form hi own judgment on such a matter as to whether thei
should abid there in the north or go awai into that wilder which
thei desir
to all of which and much like it i would onli answer that their word
should be report more i did not and inde did not dare to sai
sinc everywher i found that i wa be follow and watch by the
spi of pharaoh
at length i came to thebe and took up my abod in a fine hous that wa
the properti of the princ which i found that a messeng had command
should be made readi for me it stood near by the entranc to the avenu
of sphinx which lead to the greatest of all the theban templ
where is that mighti column hall built by the first seti and hi son
rames ii the princ grandfath
here have entranc to the place i would often wander at night
and in my spirit draw as near to heaven as ever it ha been my lot to
travel also cross the nile to the western bank i visit that
desol vallei where the ruler of egypt lie at rest the tomb of
pharaoh meneptah wa still unseal and accompani by a singl
priest with torch i crept down it paint hall and look upon the
sarcophagu of him whom so late i had seen seat in glori upon the
throne wonder as i look how much or how littl he knew of all
that pass in egypt todai
moreov i copi the papyri that i had come to seek in which there
wa noth worth preserv and some of real valu that i discov
in the ancient librari of the templ and purchas other on of
these inde told a veri strang tale that ha given me much caus for
thought especi of late year now when all my friend ar dead
thu i spent two month and should have stai longer had not
messeng reach me from the princ sai that he desir my return
of these on follow within three dai of the other and hi word
were
think you scribe ana that becaus i am no more princ of egypt i am
no longer to be obei if so bear in mind that the god mai decre
that on dai i shall grow taller than ever i wa befor and then be
sure that i will rememb your disobedi and make you shorter by a
head come swiftli my friend for i grow lone and need a man to talk
with
to which i repli that i return as fast as the barg would carri
me be so heavili laden with the manuscript that i had copi and
purchas
so i start be to tell truth glad to get awai for thi reason
two night befor when i wa walk alon from the great templ of the
hous a woman dress in mani colour appear and accost me as such
lost on do i tri to shake her off but she clung to me and i saw
that she had drunk more than enough of wine present she ask in a
voic that i thought familiar if i knew who wa the offic that
had come to thebe on the busi of some royal on and abod in the
dwell that wa known as hous of the princ i answer that hi name
wa ana
onc i knew an ana veri well she said but i left him
why i ask turn cold in my limb for although i could not see
her face becaus of a hood she wore now i began to be afraid
becaus he wa a poor fool she answer no man at all but on who
wa alwai think about write and make them and anoth came my
wai whom i like better until he desert me
and what happen to thi ana i ask
i do not know i suppos he went on dream or perhap he took
anoth wife if so i am sorri for her onli if by chanc it is the
same that ha come to thebe he must be wealthi now and i shall go and
claim him and make him keep me well
had you ani children i ask
onli on thank the god and that diedthank the god again for
otherwis it might have live to be such as i am and she sob onc
in a hard fashion and then fell to her vile endear
as she did so the hood slip from her head and i saw that the face
wa that of my wife still beauteou in a bold fashion but grown
dread with drink and sin i trembl from head to foot then said in
the disguis voic that i had us to her
woman i know thi ana he is dead and you were hi ruin still
becaus i wa hi friend take thi and go reform your wai and i drew
from my robe and gave to her a bag contain no mean weight of gold
she snatch it as a hawk snatch and see it content by the
starlight thank me sai
sure ana dead is worth more than ana aliv also it is well that he
is dead for he is gone where the child went which he love more than
life neglect me for it sake and therebi make me what i am had he
live too be as i have said a fool he would have had more illluck
with women whom he never understood farewel friend of ana who
have given me that which will enabl me to find anoth husband and
laugh wildli she reel off behind a sphinx and vanish into the
dark
for thi reason then i wa glad to escap from thebe moreov that
miser on had hurt me sore make me sure of what i had onli
guess name that with women i wa but a fool so great a fool that
then and there i swore by my guardian god that never would i look with
love on on of them again an oath which i have kept well whatev
other i mai have broken again she stab me through with the talk of
our dead child for it is true that when that sweet on took flight to
osiri my heart broke and in a fashion ha never mend itself again
lastli i fear lest it might also be true that i had neglect the
mother for the sake of thi child which wa the jewel of my worship
ye and is and therebi help her on to shame so much did thi
thought torment me that through an agent whom i trust who believ
that i wa but provid for on whom i had wrong i caus enough to
be paid to her to keep her in comfort
she did marri again a merchant about whom she had cast her toil and
in due cours spent hi wealth and brought him to ruin after which he
ran awai from her as for her she di of her evil habit in the third
year of the reign of seti ii but the god be thank she never knew
that the privat scribe of pharaoh chamber wa that ana who had been
her husband here i will end her stori
now as i wa pass down the nile with a heart more heavi than the
great stone that serv as anchor on the barg we moor at dusk on
the third night by the side of a vessel that wa sail up nile with
a strong northerli wind on board thi boat wa an offic whom i had
known at the court of pharaoh meneptah travel to thebe on duti
thi man seem so much afraid that i ask him if anyth weigh upon
hi mind then he took me asid into a palm grove upon the bank and
seat himself on the pole wherebi oxen turn a waterwheel told me
that strang thing were pass at tani
it seem that the hebrew prophet had onc more appear befor
pharaoh who sinc hi access had left the israelit in peac
not attack them with the sword as meneptah had wish to do it wa
thought through fear lest if he did so he should die as meneptah di
as befor thei had put up their prayer that the peopl of the hebrew
should be suffer to go to worship in the wilder and pharaoh had
refus them then when he went down to sail upon the river earli in
the morn of anoth dai thei had met him and on of them struck the
water with hi rod and it had turn to blood whereon ki and kherheb
and hi compani also struck the water with their rod and it turn to
blood that wa six dai ago and now thi offic swore to me that the
blood wa creep up the nile a tale at which i laugh
come then and see he said and led me back to hi boat where all the
crew seem as fear as he wa himself
he took me forward to a great water jar that stood upon the prow and
behold it seem to be full of blood and in it wa a fish dead
andstink
thi water said he i drew from the nile with my own hand not
five hour sail to the north but now we have outsp the blood which
follow after us and take a lamp he held it over the prow of the
boat and i saw that all it plank were splash as though with blood
be advis by me learn scribe he ad and fill everi jar and
skin that you can gather with sweet water lest tomorrow you and your
compani should go thirsti and he laugh a veri dreari laugh
then we part without more word for neither of us knew what to sai
and about midnight he sail on with the wind take hi chanc of
ground on the sandbank in the dark
for my part i did as he bade me though my rower who had not spoken
with hi men thought that i wa mad to load up the barg with so much
water
at the first break of dai i gave the order to start look over the
side of the barg it seem to me as though the light of dawn
had fallen from the sky into the nile whereof the water had becom
pinkhu moreov thi hue which grew ever deeper wa travel up
stream not down against the cours of natur and could not therefor
have been caus by red soil wash from the southern land the
bargemen stare and mutter togeth then on of them lean over
the side scoop up water in the hollow of hi hand and drew some into
hi mouth onli to spit it out again with a cry of fear
ti blood he cri blood osiri ha been slain afresh and hi
holi blood fill the bank of nile
so much were thei afraid inde that had i not forc them to hold to
their cours thei would have turn and row up stream or beach
the boat and fled into the desert but i cri to them to steer on
northward for thu perhap we should sooner be done with thi horror
and thei obei me ever as we went the hue of the water grew more red
almost to black till at last it seem as though we were travel
through a sea of gore in which dead fish float by the thousand or
struggl dy on the surfac also the stench wa so dread that we
must bind linen about our nostril to strain the foetid air
we came abreast of a town and from it street on great wail of terror
rose to heaven men stood stare as though thei were drunken look
at their red arm which thei had dip in the stream and women ran to
and fro upon the bank tear their hair and robe and cry out such
word as
wizard work bewitch accurs the god have slain each other and
men too must die and so forth
also we saw peasant dig hole at a distanc from the shore to see
perchanc if thei might come to water that wa sweet and wholesom all
dai long we travel thu through thi horribl flood while the sprai
driven by the strong north wind spot our flesh and garment till we
were like butcher reek from the shambl nor could we eat ani food
becaus of the stench from thi sprai which made it to tast salt as
doe fresh blood onli we drank of the water which i had provid and
the rower who had held me to be mad now name me the wisest of men on
who knew what would befal in the futur
at length toward even we note that the water wa grow much less
red with everi hour that pass which wa anoth marvel see that
abov us upstream it wa the colour of jasper whereon we paus from
our row and all defil as we were sang a hymn and gave thank to
hapi god of nile the great the secret the hidden befor sunset
inde the river wa clean again save that on the bank where we made
fast for the night the stone and rush were all stain and the dead
fish lai in thousand pollut the air to escap the stench we climb
a cliff that here rose quit close to nile in which we saw the mouth
of ancient tomb that long ago had been rob and left empti purpos
to sleep in on of them
a path worn by the feet of men ran to the largest of these tomb
whenc as we drew near we heard the sound of wail look in i
saw a woman and some children crouch upon the floor of the tomb their
head cover with dust who when thei perceiv us cri more loudli
than befor though with harsh dry voic think no doubt that we
were robber or perhap ghost becaus of our bloodstain garment
also there wa anoth child a littl on that did not cry becaus
it wa dead i ask the woman what pass but even when she understood
that we were onli men who meant her no harm she could not speak or do
more than gasp water water we gave her and the children to drink
from the jar which we had brought with us which thei did greedili
after which i drew her stori from her
she wa the wife of a fisherman who made hi home in thi cave and said
that seven dai befor the nile had turn to blood so that thei could
not drink of it and had no water save a littl in a pot nor could
thei dig to find it sinc here the ground wa all rock nor could thei
escap sinc when he saw the marvel her husband in hi fear had leapt
from hi boat and wade to land and the boat had float awai
i ask where wa her husband and she point behind her i went to
look and there found a man hang by hi neck from a rope that wa
fix to the capit of a pillar in the tomb quit dead and cold
return sick at heart i inquir of her how thi had come about she
answer that when he saw that all the fish had perish take awai
hi live and that thirst had kill hi youngest child he went mad
and creep to the back of the tomb without her knowledg hung himself
with a net rope it wa a dread stori
have given the widow of our food we went to sleep in anoth tomb
not like the compani of those dead on next morn at the dawn we
took the woman and her children on board the barg and row them three
hour journei to a town where she had a sister whom she found the
dead man and the child we left there in the tomb sinc my men would not
defil themselv by touch them
so see much terror and miseri on our journei at last we came safe
to memphi leav the boatmen to draw up the barg i went to the
palac speak with none and wa led at onc to the princ i found
him in a shade chamber seat side by side with the ladi merapi and
hold her hand in such a fashion that thei remind me of the lifes
ka statu of a man and hi wife such as i have seen in the ancient
tomb cut when the sculptor knew how to fashion the perfect like
of men and women thi thei no longer do todai i think becaus the
priest have taught them that it is not law he wa talk to her
in a low voic while she listen smile sweetli as she ever did
but with ey fix straight befor her that were as it seem to me
fill with fear i thought that she look veri beauti with her
hair outspread over her white robe and held back from her templ by a
littl fillet of god but as i look i rejoic to find that my heart
no longer yearn for her as it had upon that night when i had seen her
seat beneath the tree without the pleasurehous now she wa it
friend no more and so she remain until all wa finish as both the
princ and she knew well enough
when he saw me seti sprang from hi seat and came to greet me as a man
doe the friend whom he love i kiss hi hand and go to merapi
kiss her also note that on it now shone that ring which onc she
had reject as too larg
tell me ana all that ha befallen you he said in hi pleasant
eager voic
mani thing princ on of them veri strang and terribl i
answer
strang and terribl thing have happen here also broke in merapi
and ala thi is but the begin of woe
so sai she rose as though she could trust herself to speak no more
bow first to her lord and then to me and left the chamber
i look at the princ and he answer the question in my ey
jabez ha been here he said and fill her heart with forebod
if pharaoh will not let the israelit go by amon i wish he would let
jabez go to some place whenc he never could return but tell me have
you also met blood travel against the stream of nile it would seem
so and he glanc at the rusti stain that no wash would remov
from my garment
i nod and we talk togeth long and earnestli but in the end were
no wiser for all our talk for neither of us knew how it came about
that men by strike water with a rod could turn it into what seem to
be blood as the hebrew prophet and ki both had done or how that blood
could travel up the nile against the stream and everywher endur for a
space of seven dai ye and spread too to all the canal in egypt so
that men must dig hole for water and dig them fresh each dai becaus
the blood crept in and poison them but both of us thought that thi
wa the work of the god and most of all of that god whom the hebrew
worship
you rememb ana said the princ the messag which you brought to
me from jabez name that no harm should come to me becaus of these
israelit and their curs well no harm as come as yet except the
harm of jabez for he came on the dai befor the new of thi blood
plagu reach us jabez appear disguis as a merchant of syrian
stuff all of which he sold to me at three time their valu he
obtain admiss to the chamber of merapi where she is accustom to
see whom she will and under pretenc of show her hi stuff spoke
with her and as i fear told her what you and i were so care to
hide that she would bring troubl on me at the least she ha never
been quit the same sinc and i have thought it wise to make her swear
by an oath which i know she will never break that now we ar on she
will not attempt to separ herself from me while we both have life
did he wish her to go awai with him princ
i do not know she never told me so still i am sure that had he come
with hi evil talk befor that dai when you return from tani she
would have gone now i hope that there ar reason that will keep her
where she is
what then did he sai princ
littl beyond what he had alreadi said to you that great troubl were
about to fall on egypt he ad that he wa sent to save me and mine
from these troubl becaus i had been a friend to the hebrew in so far
as that wa possibl then he walk through thi hous and all round
it garden as he went recit someth that wa written on a
roll of which i could not understand the mean and now and again
prostrat himself to prai to hi god thu where the canal enter the
garden and where it leav the garden he stai to prai as he did at
the well whenc drink water is drawn moreov led by merapi he
visit all my cornland and those where my cattl ar herd recit
and prai until the servant thought that he wa mad after thi he
return with her and as it chanc i overheard their part she
said to him
the hous you have bless and it is safe the field you have bless
and thei ar safe will you not bless me also o my uncl and ani that
ar born of me
he answer shake hi head i have no command my niec either to
bless or to curs you as did that fool whom the princ slew you have
chosen your own path apart from your peopl it mai be well or it
mai be ill or perhap both and henceforth you must walk it alon to
wherev it mai lead farewel for perhap we shall meet no more
thu speak thei pass out of earshot but i could see that still
she plead and still he shook hi head in the end howev she gave
him an offer of all that she had i think though whether thi went
to the templ of the hebrew or into hi own pouch i know not at least
it seem to soften him for he kiss her on the brow tenderli enough
and depart with the air of a happi merchant who ha sold hi ware
but of all that pass between them merapi would tell me noth nor
did i tell her of what i had overheard
and then
and then ana came the stori of the hebrew prophet who made the water
into blood and of ki and hi discipl who did likewis the latter
i did not believ becaus i said it would be more reason had ki
turn the blood back into water instead of make more blood of which
there wa enough alreadi
i think that magician have no reason
or can do mischief onli ana at ani rate after the stori came the
blood itself and stai with us seven whole dai leav much sick
behind it becaus of the stench of the rot fish now for the
marvelher about my hous there wa no blood though abov and below
the canal wa full of it the water remain as it ha alwai been and
the fish swam in it as thei have alwai done also that of the well
kept sweet and pure when thi came to be known thousand crowd to the
place clamour for water that is until thei found that outsid the
gate it grew red in their vessel after which although some still
came thei drank the water where thei stood which thei must do
quickli
and what tale do thei tell of thi in memphi princ i ask
astonish
certain of them sai that not ki but i am the greatest magician in
egyptnev ana wa fame more lightli earn and certain sai that
merapi of whose do in the templ at tani some tale ha reach
them is the real magician she be an israelit of the tribe of the
hebrew prophet hush she return
chapter xiv
ki come to memphi
now of all the terror of which thi turn of the water into blood wa
the begin in egypt i ana the scribe will not write for if i did
so never in my lifedai should i who am old find time to finish the
stori of them over a period of mani mani moon thei came on by on
till the land grew mad with want and woe alwai the tale wa the same
the hebrew prophet would visit pharaoh at tani and demand that
he should led their peopl go threaten him with vengeanc if he
refus yet he did refus for some mad had hold of him or perhap
the god of the israelit laid an enchant on him why i know not
thu but a littl while after the terror of blood came a plagu of frog
that fill egypt from north to south and when these were taken awai
made the air to stink thi miracl ki and hi compani work also
send the frog into goshen where thei plagu the israelit but
howev it came about at seti palac at memphi and on the land that
he own around it there were no frog or at least but few of them
although at night from the field about the sound of their croak went
up like the sound of beaten drum
next came a plagu of lice and these ki and hi companion would have
also call down upon the hebrew but thei fail and afterward
struggl no more against the magic of the israelit then follow a
plagu of fli so that the air wa black with them and no food could
be kept sweet onli in seti palac there were no fli and in the
garden but a few after thi a terribl pest began among the cattl
whereof thousand di but of seti great herd not on wa even sick
nor as we learn wa there a hoof the less in the land of goshen
thi plagu struck egypt but a littl while after merapi had given birth
to a son a veri beauti child with hi mother ey that wa name
seti after hi father now the marvel of the escap of the princ and
hi household and all that wa hi from these curs spread abroad and
made much talk so that mani sent to inquir of it
among the first came old bakenkhonsu with a messag from pharaoh and
a privat on to myself from the princess userti whose pride would not
suffer her to ask aught of seti we could tell him noth except what
i have written which at first he did not believ have satisfi
himself howev that the thing wa true he said that he had fallen
sick and could not travel back to tani therefor he ask leav of the
princ to rest a while in hi hous he who had been the friend of hi
father hi grandfath and hi greatgrandfath seti laugh as
inde did the cun old man himself and there with us bakenkhonsu
remain till the end to our great joi for he wa the most pleasant
of all companion and the most learn as for hi messag on of hi
servant took back the answer to pharaoh and to userti with the new of
hi master grievou sick
some eight dai or so later as i stood on morn bask in the sun
at that gate of the palac garden which overlook the templ of ptah
idli watch the process of priest pass through it court and
chant as thei went for becaus of the mani sick at thi time
i left the palac but rare i saw a tall figur approach me drape
against the morn cold the man drew near and address me over the
head of the guard ask if he could see the ladi merapi i answer no
as she wa engag in nurs her son
and in other thing i think he said with mean in a voic that
seem familiar to me well can i see the princ seti
i answer no he wa also engag
in nurs hi own soul studi the ey of the ladi merapi the
smile of hi infant the wisdom of the scribe ana and the attribut
of the hundr and on god that ar known to him includ that of
israel i suppos said the familiar voic ad then can i see
thi scribe ana who i understand be lucki hold himself learn
now anger at the scof of thi stranger though all the time i
felt that he wa none i answer that the scribe ana wa strive to
mend hi luck by the pursuit of the goddess of learn in hi studi
let him pursu mock the stranger sinc she is the onli woman that
he is ever like to catch yet it is true that onc on caught him if
you ar of hi acquaint ask him of hi talk with her in the avenu
of the sphinx outsid the great templ at thebe and of what it cost
him in gold and tear
hear thi i put my hand to my forehead and rub my ey think
that i must have fallen into a dream there in the sunshin when i
lift it again all wa the same as befor there stood the sentri
indiffer to that which had no interest for him the cock that had
moult it tail still scratch in the dirt the crest hoopo still
sat spread it wing on the head of on of the two great statu of
rames which watch the gate a watersel in the distanc still
cri hi ware but the stranger wa gone then i knew that i had been
dream and turn to go also to find myself face to face with him
man i said indignantli how in the name of ptah and all hi priest
did you pass a sentri and through that gate without my see you
do not troubl yourself with a new problem when alreadi you have so
mani to perplex you friend ana sai have you yet solv that of how
a rod like thi turn itself into a snake in your hand and he threw
back hi hood reveal the shave head and the glow ey of the
kherheb ki
no i have not i answer and i thank you for here he proffer
me the staff but i will not try the trick again next time the beast
might bite well ki as you can pass in here without my leav why do
you ask it in short what do you want with me now that those hebrew
prophet have put you on your back
hush ana never grow angri it wast strength of which we have so
littl to spare for you know be so wise or perhap you do not
know that at birth the god give us a certain store of it and when
that is us we die and have to go elsewher to fetch more at thi rate
your life will be short ana for you squander it in emot
what do you want i repeat be too angri to disput with him
i want to find an answer to the question you ask so roughli why the
hebrew prophet have as you sai put me on my back
not be a magician as you pretend you ar i can give you none ki
never for on moment did i suppos that you could he repli blandli
stretch out hi hand and leav the staff which had fallen from
them stand in front of him it wa not till afterward that i
rememb that thi accurs bit of wood stood there of itself without
visibl support for it rest on the pavingston of the gatewai
but as it chanc you have in thi hous the master or rather the
mistress of all magician as everi egyptian know todai the ladi
merapi and i would see her
why do you sai she is a mistress of magician i ask indignantli
why doe on bird know anoth of it own kind why doe the water here
remain pure when all other water turn to blood why do not the frog
croak in seti hall and why do the fli avoid hi meat why also
did the statu of amon melt befor her glanc while all my magic fell
back from her breast like arrow from a shirt of mail those ar the
question that egypt ask and i would have an answer to them from the
belov of seti or of the god set she who is name moon of israel
then why not go seek it for yourself ki to you doubtless it would
be a small matter to take the form of a snake or a rat or a bird and
creep or run or fly into the presenc of merapi
mayhap it would not be difficult ana or better still i might visit
her in her sleep as i visit you on a certain night at thebe when
you told me of a talk you had held with a woman in the avenu of the
sphinx and of what it cost you in gold and tear but as it chanc
i wish to appear as a man and a friend and to stai a while bakenkhonsu
tell me that he find life here at memphi veri pleasant free too
from the sick which just now seem to be so common in egypt so why
should not i do the same ana
i look at hi round ripe face on which wa fix a smile unchang
as that worn by the mask on mummi coffin from which i think he must
have copi it and at the cold deep ey abov and shiver a
littl to tell truth i fear thi man whom i felt to be in touch with
presenc and thing that ar not of our world and thought it wisest to
withstand him no more
that is a question which you had best put to my master seti who own
thi hous come i will lead you to him i said
so we went to the great portico of the palac pass in and out
through the paint pillar toward my own apart whenc i
purpos to send a messag to the princ as it chanc thi wa
needless sinc present we saw him seat in a littl bai out of reach
of the sun by hi side wa merapi and on a woven rug between them lai
their sleep infant at whom both of them gaze adoringli
strang that thi mother heart should hide more might than can be
boast by all the god of egypt strang that those mother ey can
rive the ancient glori of amon into dust ki said to me in so low a
voic that it almost seem as though i heard hi thought and not hi
word which perhap inde i did
now we stood in front of these three and the sun be behind us for
it wa still earli the shadow of the cloak ki fell upon a babe and
lai there a hate fanci came to me it look like the evil form
of an embalm bend over on new dead the babe felt it open it
larg ey and wail merapi saw it and snatch up her child seti
too rose from hi seat exclaim who come
thereon to my amaz ki prostrat himself and utter the
salut which mai onli be given to the king of egypt life blood
strength pharaoh pharaoh pharaoh
who dare utter those word to me said seti ana what madman do you
bring here
mai it pleas the princ he brought me here i repli faintli
fellow tell me who bade you sai such word than which none were ever
less welcom
those whom i serv princ
and whom do you serv
the god of egypt
then man i think the god must need your compani pharaoh doe not
sit at memphi and were he to hear of them
pharaoh will never hear them princ until he hear all thing
thei stare at each other then as i had done by the gate seti rub
hi ey and said
sure thi is ki why then did you look otherwis just now
the god can chang the fashion of their messeng a thousand time in
a flash if so thei will o princ
now seti anger pass and turn to laughter
ki ki he said you should keep these trick for court but sinc
you ar in the mood what salut have you for thi ladi by my side
ki consid her till she who ever fear and hate him shrank befor
hi gaze
crown of hathor i greet you belov of isi shine on perfect in the
sky shed light and wisdom er you set
now thi sai puzzl me inde i did not fulli understand it until
bakenkhonsu remind me that merapi name wa moon of israel that
hathor goddess of love is crown with the moon in all her statu
that isi is the queen of mysteri and wisdom and that ki who thought
merapi perfect in love and beauti also the greatest of all sorceress
wa liken her to these
ye i answer but what did he mean when he talk about her
set
doe not the moon alwai set and is it not sometim eclips he
ask shortli
so doe the sun i answer
true so doe the sun you ar grow wise veri wise inde friend
ana ohoho
to return when seti heard these word he laugh again and said
i must think that sai over but it is clear that you have a pretti
turn for prais is it not so merapi crown of hathor and holder of
the wisdom of isi
but merapi who i think understood more than either of us turn
pale and shrank further awai but outward into the sunshin
well ki went on seti finish your greet what for the babe
ki consid it also
now that it is no longer in the shadow i see that thi shoot from the
royal root of pharaoh grow so fast and tall that my ey cannot reach
it crest he is too high and great for greet princ
then merapi utter a littl cry and bore the child awai
she is afraid of magician and their dark sai said seti look
after her with a troubl smile
that she should not be princ see that she is the mistress of all
our tribe
the ladi merapi a magician well after a fashion yeswher the
heart of men ar concern do you not think so ana but be more
plain ki it is still earli and i love riddl best at night
what other could have shatter the strong and holi hous where the
majesti of amon dwell on earth not even those prophet of the hebrew
as i think what other could fenc thi garden round against the curs
that have fallen upon egypt ask ki earnestli for now all hi
mock manner had depart
i do not think she doe these thing ki i think some power doe
them through her and i know that she dare to face amon in hi templ
becaus she wa bidden so to do by the priest of her peopl
princ he answer with a short laugh a while ago i sent you a
messag by ana which perhap other thought mai have driven from hi
memori it wa as to the natur of that power of which you speak in
that messag i said that you were wise but now i perceiv that you lack
wisdom like the rest of us for if you had it you would know that
the tool which carv is not the guid hand and the lightn which
smite is not the send strength so with thi fair love of your and
so with me and all that work marvel we do not the thing we seem to
do who ar but the tool and the lightn what i would know is who or
what guid her hand and give her the might to shield or to destroi
the question is wide ki or so it seem to me who as you sai have
littl wisdom and whoever can answer it hold the kei of knowledg
your magic is but a small thing which seem great becaus so few can
handl it what miracl is it that make the flower to grow the child
to be born the nile to rise and the sun and star to shine in heaven
what caus man to be half a beast and half a god and to grow downward
to the beast or upward to the godor both what is faith and what is
unbelief who made these thing through them to declar the purpos of
life of death and of etern you shake your head you do not know
how then can i know who as you point out am but foolish go get your
answer from the ladi merapi self onli mayhap you will find your
question counter
ill take my chanc thank to merapi lord a boon o princ sinc
you will not suffer that other name which come easiest to the lip of
on to whom the present and the futur ar sometim much alik
seti look at him keenli and for the first time with a ting of fear
in hi ey
leav the futur to itself ki he exclaim whatev mai be the
mind of egypt just now i hold the present enough for me and he
glanc first at the chair in which merapi had been seat and then at
the cloth upon which hi son had lain
i take back my word the princ is wiser than i thought magician
know the futur becaus at time it rush down upon them and thei must
it is that which make them lone sinc what thei know thei cannot
sai but onli fool will seek it
yet now and again thei lift a corner of the veil ki thu i rememb
certain sai of your own as to on who would find a great treasur
in the land of goshen and thereaft suffer some tempor loss andi
forget the rest man ceas smile at me with your face and pierc me
through with your swordlik ey you can command all thing what boon
then do you seek from me
to lodg here a littl while princ in the compani of ana and
bakenkhonsu hearken i am no more kherheb i have quarrel with
pharaoh perhap becaus a littl breath from that great wind of the
futur blow through my soul perhap becaus he doe not reward me
accord to my meritswhat doe it matter which at least i have come
to be of on mind with you o princ and think that pharaoh would do
well to let the hebrew go and therefor no longer will i attempt to
match my magic against their but he refus so we have part
why doe he refus ki
perhap it is written that he must refus or perhap becaus think
himself the greatest of all king instead of but a playth of the
god pride lock the door of hi heart that in a dai to come the
tempest of the futur whereof i have spoken mai wreck the hous which
hold it i do not know why he refus but her high userti is much
with him
for on who doe not know you have mani reason and all of them
differ o instruct ki said seti
then he paus walk up and down the portico and i who knew hi mind
guess that he wa wonder whether he would do well to suffer ki
whom at time he fear becaus hi object were secret and never
chang to abid in hi hous or whether he should send him awai ki
also shiver a littl as though he felt the shadow cold and descend
from the portico into the bright sunshin here he held out hi hand and
a great moth drop from the roof and lit upon it whereon it lift it
to hi lip which move as though he were talk to the insect
what shall i do mutter seti as he pass me
i do not altogeth like hi compani nor i think doe the ladi
merapi but he is an ill man to offend princ i answer look he
is talk with hi familiar
seti return to hi place and shake off the moth which seem loth
to leav him for twice it settl on hi head ki came back into the
shadow
where is the us of your put question to me ki when accord
to your own show alreadi you know the answer that i will give what
answer shall i give ask the princ
that paint creatur which sat upon my hand just now seem to
whisper to me that you would sai o princ stai ki and be my
faith servant and us ani littl lore you have to shield my hous
from ill
then seti laugh in hi careless fashion and repli
have your wai sinc it is a rule that none of the royal blood of egypt
mai refus hospit to those who seek it have been their friend
and i will not quot against your moth what a bat whisper in my ear
last night nai none of your salut reveal to you by insect or
by the futur and he gave him hi hand to kiss
when ki wa gone i said
i told you that nighthaunt thing wa hi familiar
then you told me folli ana the knowledg that ki ha he doe not get
from moth or beetl yet now that it is too late i wish that i had
ask the ladi merapi what her will wa in thi matter you should have
thought of that ana instead of suffer your mind to be led astrai
by an insect sit on hi hand which is just what he meant that you
should do well in punish dai by dai it shall be your lot to look
upon a man with a counten likelik what
like that which i saw upon the coffin of the good god your divin
father meneptah as it wa prepar for him dure hi life in the
embalm shop at tani i answer
ye said the princ a face smile etern at the nothing
which is life and death but in certain light with ey of fire
on the follow dai by her invit i walk with the ladi merapi
in the garden the head nurs follow us bear the royal child in
her arm
i wish to ask you about ki friend ana she said you know he is my
enemi for you must have heard the word he spoke to me in the templ
of amon at tani it seem that my lord ha made him the guest of thi
houseoh look and she point befor her
i look and there a few pace awai where the shadow of the
overhang palm wa deepest stood ki he wa lean on hi staff
the same that had turn to a snake in my hand and gaze upward like
on who is lost in thought or listen to the sing of bird merapi
turn as though to fly but at that moment ki saw us although he still
seem to gaze upward
greet o moon of israel he said bow greet o conqueror of
ki
she bow back and stood still as a littl bird stand when it see a
snake there wa a long silenc which he broke by ask
why seek that from ana which ki himself is eager to give ana is
learn but is hi heart the heart of ki abov all why tell him that
ki the humblest of your servant is your enemi
now merapi straighten herself look into hi ey and answer
have i told ana aught that he did not know did not ana hear the last
word you said to me in the templ of amon at tani
doubtless he heard them ladi and therefor i am glad that he is here
to hear their mean ladi merapi at that moment i the sacrific to
amon wa fillednot with my own spirit but with the angri spirit of
the god whom you had humbl as never befor had befallen him in
egypt the god through me demand of you the secret of your magic and
promis you hi hate if you refus ladi you have hi hate but mine
you have not sinc i also have hi hate becaus i and he through me
have been worst by your prophet ladi we ar fellowtravel in
the vallei of troubl
she gaze at him steadili and i could see that of all that pass hi
lip she believ no on word make no answer to him and hi talk of
amon she ask onli
why do you come here to do me ill who have done you none
you ar mistaken ladi he repli i come here to refug from amon
and from hi servant pharaoh whom amon drive on to ruin i know well
that if you will it you can whisper in the ear of the princ and
present he will put me forth onli then and he look over her
head to where the nurs stood rock the sleep child
then what magician
give no answer he turn to me
learn ana to you rememb meet me at tani on night
i shook my head though i guess well enough what night he meant
your memori weaken learn ana or rather is confus for we met
often did we not
then he stare at the staff in hi hand i stare also becaus i could
not help it and saw or thought i saw the dead wood begin to swell and
curv thi wa enough for me and i said hastili
if you mean the night of the coron i do recal
ah i thought you would you learn ana who like all scribe observ
so close will have note how littl thingssuch as the scent of a
flower or the pass of a bird or even the writh of a snake in the
dustoften bring back to the mind event or word it ha forgotten long
ago
wellwhat of our meet i broke in hastili
noth at allor onli thi just befor it you were talk with the
hebrew jabez the ladi merapi uncl were you not
ye i wa talk with him in an open place alon
not so learn scribe for you know we ar never alonequit could
you but see it everi grain of sand ha an ear
be pleas to explain o ki
nai ana it would be too long and short jest ar ever the best as i
have told you you were not alon for though there were some word that
i did not catch i heard much of what pass between you and jabez
what did you hear i ask wrathfulli and next instant wish that i
had bitten through my tongu befor it shape the word
much much let me think you spoke about the ladi merapi and whether
she would do well to bide at memphi in the shadow of the princ or to
return to goshen into the shadow of a certaini forget the name jabez
a wellinstruct man said he thought that she might be happier at
memphi though perhap her presenc there would bring a great sorrow
upon herself andanoth
here again he look at the child which seem to feel hi glanc for
it woke up and beat the air with it littl hand
the nurs felt it also although her head wa turn awai for she
start and then took shelter behind the bole of on of the palmtre
now merapi said in a low and shaken voic
i know what you mean magician for sinc then i have seen my uncl
jabez
as i have also sever time ladi which mai explain to you what ana
here think so wonder name that i should have learn what thei
said togeth when he thought thei were alon which as i have told
him no on can ever be at least in egypt the land of listen
god
and spy sorcer i exclaim
and spy sorcer he repeat after me and scribe who take
note and learn them by heart and priest with ear as larg as ass
and leav that whisperand mani other thing
ceas your gibe and sai what you have to sai said merapi in the
same broken voic
he made no answer but onli look at the tree behind which the nurs
and child had vanish
oh i know i know she exclaim in tone that were like a cry my
child is threaten you threaten my child becaus you hate me
your pardon ladi it is true that evil threaten thi royal babe
or so i understood from jabez who know so much but it is not i that
threaten it ani more than i hate you in whom i acknowledg a fellow of
my craft but on greater than myself that it is my duti to obei
have done why do you torment me
can the priest of the moongoddess torment isi mother of magic with
their prayer and offer and can i who would make a prayer and an
offer
what prayer and what offer
the prayer that you will suffer me to shelter in thi hous from the
mani danger that threaten me at the hand of pharaoh and the prophet
of your peopl and an offer of such help as i can give by my art
and knowledg against blacker danger which threatenanoth
here onc more he gaze at the trunk of the tree beyond which i heard
the infant wail
if i consent what then she ask hoars
then ladi i will strive to protect a certain littl on against a
curs which jabez tell me threaten him and mani other in whom run
the blood of egypt i will strive if i am allow to bide herei do
not sai that i shall succe for as your lord ha remind me and as
you show me in the templ of amon my strength is smaller than that of
the prophet and prophetess of israel
and if i refus
then ladi he answer in a voic that rang like iron i am sure
that on whom you lovea mother lovewil shortli be rock in the
arm of the god whom we name osiri
stai she cri and turn fled awai
why ana she is gone he said and that befor i could bargain
for my reward well thi i must find in your compani how strang ar
women ana here you have on of the greatest of her sex as you learn
in the templ of amon and yet she open beneath the sun of hope and
shrivel beneath the shadow of fear like the touch leav of that
tender plant which grow upon the bank of the river she who with her
ey set on the mysteri that is beyond whereof she hear the whisper
wind should tread both earthli hope and fear beneath her feet or make
of them step stone to glori were she a man she would do so but
her sex wreck her she who think more of the kiss of a babe than
of all the splendour she might harbour in her breast ye a babe a
singl wretch littl babe you had on onc did you not ana
oh to set and hi fire with you and your evil talk i said and left
him
when i had gone a littl wai i look back and saw that he wa
laugh throw up hi staff as he laugh and catch it again
set and hi fire he call after me i wonder what thei ar like
ana perhap on dai we shall learn you and i togeth scribe ana
so ki took up hi abod with us in the same lodg as bakenkhonsu
and almost everi dai i would meet them walk in the garden sinc i
who wa of the princ tabl except when he at with the ladi merapi
did not take my food with them then we would talk togeth about mani
subject on those which had to do with learn or even religion i
had the better of ki who wa no great scholar or master of theologi
but alwai befor we part he would plant some arrow in my rib at
which old bakenkhonsu laugh and laugh again yet ever threw over me
the shield of hi vener wisdom just becaus he love me i think
it wa after thi that the plagu struck the cattl of egypt so that
ten of thousand of them di though not all as wa report but as
i have said of the herd of seti none di nor as we were told did
ani of those of the israelit in the land of goshen now there wa
great distress in egypt but ki smile and said that he knew it would
be so and that there wa much wors to come for which i could have
smitten him over the head with hi own staff had i not fear that if
i did so it might onc more turn to a serpent in my hand
old bakenkhonsu look upon the matter with anoth face he said that
sinc hi last wife di i think some fifti year befor he had found
life veri dull becaus he miss the exercis of her temper and her
habit of present thing as these never had been nor could possibl
ever be now howev it grew interest again sinc the marvel
which were happen in egypt be quit contrari to natur remind
him of hi last wife and her argument all of which wa hi wai of
sai that in those year we live in a new world whereof for the
egyptian set the evil on seem to be the king
but still pharaoh would not let the hebrew go perhap becaus he had
vow as much to meneptah who set him on the throne or perhap for
those other reason or on of them which ki had given to the princ
then came the curs of sore afflict man woman and child throughout
the land save those who dwelt in the household of seti thu the
watchman and hi famili whose lodg wa without the gate suffer but
the watchman and hi famili who live within the gate not twenti pace
awai did not suffer which caus bitter between their women
in the same wai ki who resid as a guest of the princ at memphi
suffer from no sore wherea those of hi colleg who remain at
tani were more heavili smitten than ani other so that some of them
di when he heard thi ki laugh and said that he had told them
it would be so also pharaoh himself and even her high userti were
smitten the latter upon the cheek which made her unsightli for a
while inde bakenkhonsu heard i know not how that so great wa her
rage that she even bethought her of return to her lord seti in whose
hous she had learn peopl were safe and the beauti of her successor
moon of israel remain unscar and wa even greater than befor
tide that i think bakenkhonsu himself convei to her but in the end
thi her pride or her jealousi prevent her from do
now the heart of egypt began to turn toward seti in good earnest
the princ thei said had oppos the polici of the oppress of the
hebrew and becaus he could not prevail had abandon hi right to the
throne which pharaoh amenmes had purchas at the price of accept
that polici whereof the fruit had been prove to be destruct
therefor thei reason if amenmes were depos and the princ
reign their miseri would ceas so thei sent deput to him
secretli prai him to rise against amenmes and promis him
support but he would listen to none of them tell them that he wa
happi as he wa and sought no other state still pharaoh grew jealou
for all these thing hi spi report to him and set about plot to
destroi seti
of the first of these userti warn me by a messeng but the second
and wors ki discov in some strang wai so that the murder wa
trap at the gate and kill by the watchman whereon seti said that
after all he had been wise to give hospit to ki that is if to
continu to live were wisdom the ladi merapi also said as much to me
but i note that alwai she shun ki whom she held in mistrust and
fear
chapter xv
the night of fear
then came the hail and some month after the hail the locust and
egypt went mad with woe and terror it wa known to us for with ki and
bakenkhonsu in the palac we knew everyth that the hebrew prophet
had promis thi hail becaus pharaoh would not listen to them
therefor seti caus it to be put about through all the land that the
egyptian should shelter their cattl or such as were left to them
at the first sign of storm but pharaoh heard of it and issu a
proclam that thi wa not to be done inasmuch as it would be an
insult to the god of egypt still mani did so and these save their
cattl it wa strang to see that wall of jag ic stretch
from earth to heaven and destroi all upon which it fell the tall
datepalm were strip even of their bark the soil wa churn up
men and beast if caught abroad were slain or shatter
i stood at the gate and watch it there not a yard awai fell the
white hail turn the world to wreck while here within the gate there
wa not a singl stone merapi watch also and present came ki as
well and with him bakenkhonsu who for onc had never seen anyth
like thi in all hi long life but ki watch merapi more than he did
the hail for i saw him search out her veri soul with those merciless
ey of hi
ladi he said at length tell your servant i beseech you how you
do thi thing and he point first to the tree and flower within the
gate and then to the wreck without
at first i thought that she had not heard him becaus of the roar of the
hail for she step forward and open the side wicket to admit a
poor jackal that wa scratch at the bar still thi wa not so for
present she turn and said
doe the kherheb the greatest magician in egypt ask an unlearn
woman to teach him of marvel well ki i cannot becaus i neither do
it nor know how it is done
bakenkhonsu laugh and ki paint smile grew as it were brighter
than befor
that is not what thei sai in the land of goshen ladi he answer
and not what the hebrew women sai here in memphi nor is it what the
priest of amon sai these declar that you have more magic than all the
sorcer of the nile here is the proof of it and he point to the
ruin without and the peac within ad ladi if you can protect
your own home why cannot you protect the innoc peopl of egypt
becaus i cannot she answer angrili if ever i had such power it
is gone from me who am now the mother of an egyptian child but i
have none there in the templ of amon some strength work through me
that is all which never will visit me again becaus of my sin
what sin ladi
the sin of take the princ seti to lord now if ani god spoke
through me it would be on of those of the egyptian sinc he of israel
ha cast me out
ki start as though some new thought had come to him and at thi
moment she turn and went awai
would that she were highpriestess of isi that she might work for us
and not against us he said
bakenkhonsu shook hi head
let that be he answer be sure that never will an israelitish
woman offer sacrific to what she would call the abomin of the
egyptian
if she will not sacrific to save the peopl let her be care lest
the peopl sacrific her to save themselv said ki in a cold voic
then he too went awai
i think that if ever that hour come then ki will have hi share in
it laugh bakenkhonsu what is the good of a shepherd who shelter
here in comfort while outsid the sheep ar dy eh ana
it wa after the plagu of locust which at all there wa left to eat
in egypt so that the poor folk who had done no wrong and had naught
to sai to the deal of pharaoh with the israelit starv by the
thousand and dure that of the great dark that laban came now
thi dark lai upon the land like a thick cloud for three whole dai
and night nevertheless though the shadow were deep there wa no
true dark over the hous of seti at memphi which stood in a funnel
of grei light stretch from earth to sky
now the terror wa increas tenfold and it seem to me that all the
hundr of thousand of memphi were gather outsid our wall so
that thei might look upon the light such as it wa if thei could do no
more seti would have admit as mani as the place would hold but ki
bade him not sai that if he did so the dark would flow in
with them onli merapi did admit some of the israelitish women who were
marri to egyptian in the citi though for her pain thei onli curs
her as a witch for now most of the inhabit of memphi were certain
that it wa merapi who keep herself safe had brought these woe
upon them becaus she wa a worshipp of an alien god
if she who is the love of egypt heir would but sacrific to egypt
god these horror would pass from us said thei have as i think
learn their lesson from the lip of ki or perhap the emissari of
userti had taught them
onc more we stood by the gate watch the peopl flit to and
fro in the gloom without for thi sight fascin merapi as a snake
fascin a bird then it wa that laban appear i knew hi hook
nose and hawklik ey at onc and she knew him also
come awai with me moon of israel he cri and all shall yet
be forgiven you but if you will not come then fear thing shall
overtak you
she stood stare at him answer never a word and just then the
princ seti reach us and saw him
take that man he command flush with anger and guard sprang
into the dark to do hi bid but laban wa gone
on the second dai of the dark the tumult wa great on the third it
wa terribl a crowd thrust the guard asid broke down the gate and
burst into the palac humbl demand that the ladi merapi would come
to prai for them yet show by their mien that if she would not come
thei meant to take her

that is for the princ to judg said ki though i do not see how it
can harm the ladi merapi to prai for us in the open squar of memphi

than we would
i do not wish to go cri merapi not know for whom i am to prai
or how

onli hearken to the roar of the mob if you refus i think that veri
soon everi on of us will have reach a land where perhap it is not
need to prai at all and he look at the infant in her arm
i will go she said
she went forth carri the child and i walk behind her so did the
princ but in that dark he wa cut off by a rush of thousand of
folk and i saw him no more till all wa over bakenkhonsu wa with me
lean on my arm but ki had gone on befor us for hi own end as i
think a huge mob move through the dens dark in which here and
there light float like lamp upon a quiet sea i did not know where
we were go until the light of on of these lamp shone upon the knee
of the coloss statu of the great rames reveal hi cartouch
then i knew that we were near the gatewai of the vast templ of memphi
the largest perhap in the whole world
we went on through court after pillar court priest lead us by
the hand till we came to a shrine command the biggest court of all
which wa pack with men and women it wa that of isi who held at
her breast the infant horu
o friend ana cri merapi give help thei ar dress me in
strang garment
i tri to get near to her but wa thrust back a voic which i thought
to be that of ki sai
on your life fool
present a lamp wa held up and by the light of it i saw merapi seat
in a chair dress like a goddess in the sacerdot robe of isi and
wear the vultur cap headdressbeauti exceedingli in her arm
wa the child dress as the infant horu
prai for us mother isi cri thousand of voic that the curs
of black mai be remov
then she prai sai
o my god take awai thi curs of black from these innoc
peopl and all of those present repeat her prayer
at that moment the sky began to lighten and in less than half an hour
the sun shone out when merapi saw how she and the child were arrai
she scream aloud and tore off her jewel trap cry
woe woe woe great woe upon the peopl of egypt
but in their joi at the new found light few hearken to her who thei
were sure had brought back the sun again laban appear for a moment
witch traitress he cri you have worn the robe of isi and
worship in the templ of the god of the egyptian the curs of the
god of israel be on you and that which is born of you
i sprang at him but he wa gone then we bore merapi home swoon
so thi troubl pass by but from that time forward merapi would not
suffer her son to be taken out of her sight
why do you make so much of him ladi i ask on dai
becaus i would love him well while he is here friend she answer
but of thi sai noth to hi father
a while went by and we heard that still pharaoh would not let the
israelit go then the princ seti sent bakenkhonsu and myself to tani
to see pharaoh and to sai to him
i seek noth for myself and i forget those evil which you would have
work on me through jealousi but i sai unto you that if you will not
let these stranger go great and terribl thing shall befal you and
all egypt therefor hear my prayer and let them go
now bakenkhonsu and i came befor pharaoh and we saw that he wa greatli
ag for hi hair had gone grei about hi templ and the flesh hung in
bag beneath hi ey also not for on minut could he stai still
is your lord and ar you also of the servant of thi hebrew prophet
whom the egyptian worship as a god becaus he ha done them so much
ill he ask it mai well be so sinc i hear that my cousin seti
keep an israelitish witch in hi hous who ward off from him all the
plagu that have smitten the rest of egypt and that to him ha fled
also ki the kherheb my magician moreov i hear that in payment for
these wizardri he ha been promis the throne of egypt by mani fickl
and fear on among my peopl let him be care lest i lift him up
higher than he hope who alreadi have enough traitor in thi land and
you two with him
now i said noth who saw that the man wa mad but bakenkhonsu
laugh out loud and answer
o pharaoh i know littl but i know thi although i be old name
that after men have ceas to speak your name i shall still hold
convers with the wearer of the doubl crown in egypt now will you let
these hebrew go or will you bring death upon egypt
pharaoh glare at him and answer i will not let them go
why not pharaoh tell me for i am curiou
becaus i cannot he answer with a groan becaus someth
stronger than myself forc me to deni their prayer begon
so we went and thi wa the last time that i look upon amenmes at
tani
as we left the chamber i saw the hebrew prophet enter the presenc
afterward a rumour reach us that he had threaten to kill all the
peopl in egypt but that still pharaoh would not let the israelit
depart inde it wa said that he had told the prophet that if he
appear befor him ani more he should be put to death
now we journei back to memphi with all these tide and made report
to seti when merapi heard them she went half mad weep and wring
her hand i ask her what she fear she answer death which wa
near to all of us i said
if so there ar wors thing ladi
for you mayhap you ar faith and good in your own fashion but not
for me do you not understand friend ana that i am on who ha broken
the law of the god i wa taught to worship
and which of us is there who ha not broken the law of the god we were
taught to worship ladi if in truth you have done anyth of the sort
by fly from a murder villain to on who love you well which i do
not believ sure there is forgiv for such sin as thi
ay perhap but ala the thing is blacker far have you forgotten
what i did dress in the robe of isi i worship in the templ of
isi with my boi plai the part of horu on my bosom it is a crime
that can never be forgiven to a hebrew woman ana for my god is a
jealou god yet it is true that ki trick me
if he had not ladi i think there would have been none of us left to
trick see that the peopl were craze with the dread of the dark
and believ that it could be lift by you alon as inde happen
i ad somewhat doubtfulli
more of ki trick oh do you not understand that the lift of the
dark at that moment wa ki work becaus he wish the peopl to
believ that i am inde a sorceress
why i ask
i do not know perhap that on dai he mai find a victim to bind to the
altar in hi place at least i know well that it is i who must pai
the price i and my flesh and blood whatev ki mai promis and she
look at the sleep child
do not be afraid ladi i said ki ha left the palac and you will
see him no more
ye becaus the princ wa angri with him about the trick in the
templ of isi therefor suddenli he went or pretend to go for
how can on tell where such a man mai realli be but he will come back
again bethink you ki wa the greatest magician in egypt even old
bakenkhonsu can rememb none like to him then he match himself
against the prophet of my peopl and fail
but did he fail ladi what thei did he did send among the
israelit the plagu that your prophet had sent among us
ye some of them but he wa outpac or fear to be outpac at
last is ki a man to forget that and if ki chanc realli to believ
that i am hi adversari and hi master at thi black work as becaus
of what happen in the templ of amon thousand believ todai will he
not mete me my own measur soon or late oh i fear ki ana and i fear
the peopl of egypt and were it not for my lord belov i would flee
awai into the wilder with my son and get me out of thi haunt
land hush he wake
from thi time forward until the sword fell there wa great dread in
egypt none seem to know exactli what thei dread but all thought
that it had to do with death peopl went about mournfulli look over
their shoulder as though someon were follow them and at night
thei gather togeth in knot and talk in whisper onli the hebrew
seem to be glad and happi moreov thei were make prepar
for someth new and strang thu those israelitish women who dwelt
in memphi began to sell what properti thei had and to borrow of the
egyptian especi did thei ask for the loan of jewel sai that
thei were about to celebr a feast and wish to look fine in the ey
of their countrymen none refus them what thei ask becaus all were
afraid of them thei even came to the palac and beg her ornament
from merapi although she wa a countrywoman of their own who had show
them much kind ye and see that her son wore a littl gold
circlet on hi hair on of them beg that also nor did she sai her
nai but as it chanc the princ enter and see the woman with
thi royal badg in her hand grew veri angri and forc her to restor
it
what is the us of crown without head to wear them she sneer and
fled awai laugh with all that she had gather
after she had heard that sai merapi grew even sadder and more
distraught than she wa befor and from her the troubl crept to seti
he too becam sad and ill at eas though when i ask him why he vow
he did not know but suppos it wa becaus some new plagu drew near
yet he ad as i have made shift to live through nine of them i
do not know why i should fear a tenth
still he did fear it so much that he consult bakenkhonsu as to
whether there were ani mean by which the anger of the god could be
avert
bakenkhonsu laugh and said he thought not sinc alwai if the god
were not angri about on thing thei were angri about anoth have
made the world thei did noth but quarrel with it or with other god
who had a hand in it fashion and of these quarrel men were the
victim
bear your woe princ he ad if ani come for er the nile ha
risen anoth fifti time at most whether thei have or have not been
will be the same to you
then you think that when we go west we die inde and that osiri is
but anoth name for the sunset bakenkhonsu
the old councillor shook hi great head and answer
no if ever you should lose on whom you greatli love take comfort
princ for i do not think that life end with death death is the nurs
that put it to sleep no more and in the morn it will wake again to
travel through anoth dai with those who have companion it from the
begin
where do all the dai lead it to at last bakenkhonsu
ask that of ki i do not know
to set with ki i am anger with him said the princ and went awai
not without reason i think muse bakenkhonsu but when i ask him
what he meant he would not or could not tell me
so the gloom deepen and the palac which had been merri in it wai
becam sad none knew what wa come but all knew that someth wa
come and stretch out their hand to strive to protect that which
thei love best from the stroke of the war god in the case of seti
and merapi thi wa their son now a beauti littl lad who could run
and prattl on too of a strang health and vigour for a child of the
inbr race of the ramessid never for a minut wa thi boi allow to
be out of the sight of on or other of hi parent inde i saw littl
of seti in those dai and all our learn studi came to noth
becaus he wa ever concern with merapi in plai nurs to thi son
of hi
when userti wa told of it she said in the hear of a friend of mine
without a doubt that is becaus he train hi bastard to fill the
throne of egypt
but ala all that the littl seti wa doom to fill wa a coffin
it wa a still hot even so hot that merapi had bid the nurs bring
the child bed and set it between two pillar of the great portico
there on the bed he slept love as horu the divin she sat by hi
side in a chair that had feet shape like to those of an antelop
seti walk up and down the terrac beyond the portico lean on my
shoulder and talk by snatch of thi or that occasion as he
pass he would stai for a while to make sure by the bright moonlight
that all wa well with merapi and the child as of late it had becom
a habit with him to do then without speak for fear lest he should
awak the boi he would smile at merapi who sat there brood her
head rest on her hand and pass on
the night wa veri still the palm leav did not rustl no jackal
were stir and even the shrillvoic insect had ceas their
cri moreov the great citi below wa quiet as a home of the dead
it wa as though the presag of some advanc doom scare the world to
silenc for without doubt doom wa in the air all felt it down to
the nurs woman who cower close as she dare to the chair of her
mistress and even in that heat shiver from time to time
present littl seti awok and began to prattl about someth he had
dream
what did you dream my son ask hi father
i dream he answer in hi babi talk that a woman dress as
mother wa in the templ took me by the hand and led me into the air i
look down and saw you and mother with white face and cry i began
to cry too but the woman with the feather cap told me not as she wa
take me to a beauti big star where mother would soon come to find
me
the princ and i look at each other and merapi feign to busi herself
with hush the child to sleep again it drew toward midnight and
still no on seem mind to go to rest old bakenkhonsu appear and
began to sai someth about the night be veri strang and unrest
when suddenli a littl bat that wa flit to and fro abov us fell
upon hi head and thenc to the ground we look at it and saw that it
wa dead
strang that the creatur should have di thu said bakenkhonsu
when behold anoth fell to the ground near by the black kitten which
belong to littl seti saw it fall and dart from besid hi bed where
it wa sleep befor ever it reach the bat the creatur wheel
round stood upon it hind leg scratch at the air about it then
utter on piti cry and fell over dead
we stare at it when suddenli far awai a dog howl in a veri pierc
fashion then a cow began to bale as these beast do when thei have lost
their calv next quit close at hand but without the gate there
aros the earcurdl cry of a woman in agoni which on the instant
seem to be echo from everi quarter till the air wa full of
wail
oh seti seti exclaim merapi in a voic that wa rather a hiss
than a whisper look at your son
we sprang to where the babe lai and look he had awaken and wa
stare upward with wideopen ey and frozen face the fear if such
it were pass from hi featur though still he stare he rose to
hi littl feet alwai look upward then a smile came upon hi
face a most beauti smile he stretch out hi arm as though to
clasp on who bent down toward him and fell backwardsquit dead
seti stood still as a statu we all stood still even merapi then she
bend down and lift the bodi of the boi
now my lord she said there ha fallen on you that sorrow which
jabez my uncl warn you would come if ever you had aught to do with
me now the curs of israel ha pierc my heart and now our child as
ki the evil prophesi ha grown too great for greet or even for
farewel
thu she spoke in a cold and quiet voic as on might speak of
someth long expect or foreseen then made her rever to the
princ and depart bear the bodi of the child never i think did
merapi seem more beauti to me than in thi her hour of bereav
sinc now through her woman loveli shone out some shadow of the
soul within inde such were her ey and such her movement that well
might have been a spirit and not a woman who depart from us with that
which had been her son
seti lean on my shoulder look at the empti bed and at the scare
nurs who still sat behind and i felt a tear drop upon my hand old
bakenkhonsu lift hi massiv face and look at him
griev not over much princ he said sinc er as mani year as i
have live out have come and gone thi child will be forgotten and hi
mother will be forgotten and even you o princ will live but as a
name that onc wa great in egypt and then o princ elsewher the
game will begin afresh and what you have lost shall be found anew and
the sweeter for it shelter from the vile breath of men ki magic
is not all a lie or if hi is mine hold some shadow of the truth and
when he said to you yonder in tani that not for noth were you name
lord of rebirth he spoke word that you should find comfort
tonight
i thank you councillor said seti and turn follow merapi
now i suppos we shall have more death i exclaim hardli know
what i said in my sorrow
i think not ana answer bakenkhonsu sinc the shield of jabez
or of hi god is over us alwai he foretold that troubl would come to
merapi and to seti through merapi but that is all
i glanc at the kitten
it strai here from the town three dai ago ana and the bat also
mai have flown from the town hark to the wail wa ever such a sound
heard befor in egypt
chapter xvi
jabez sell hors
bakenkhonsu wa right save the son of seti alon none di who dwelt
in or about hi hous though elsewher all the firstborn of egypt lai
dead and the firstborn of the beast also when thi came to be known
throughout the land a rage seiz the egyptian against merapi who thei
rememb had call down woe on egypt after she had been forc to
prai in the templ and as thei believ to lift the dark from
memphi
bakenkhonsu and i and other who love her point out that her own
child had di with the rest to thi it wa answer and here i
thought i saw the finger of userti and of ki that it wa noth
sinc witch did not love children moreov thei said she could
have as mani as she like and when she like make them to look like
children out of clai figur and to grow up into evil spirit to torment
the land lastli peopl swore that she had been heard to sai that
although to do it she must kill her own lord son she would not on
that account forego her vengeanc on the egyptian who onc had
treat her as a slave and murder her father further the israelit
themselv or some of them mayhap laban among them were report
to have told the egyptian that it wa the sorceress who had bewitch
princ seti who brought such great troubl on them
so it happen that the egyptian came to hate merapi who of all women
wa the sweetest and the most to be love and to her other suppos
crime ad thi also that by her witcheri she had stolen the heart
of seti awai from hi law wife and made him to turn that ladi the
royal princess of egypt even from hi gate so that she wa forc to
dwell alon at tani for in all these matter none blame seti whom
everyon in egypt love becaus it wa known that he would have dealt
with the israelit in a veri differ fashion and thu avert all
the woe that had desol the ancient land of khem as for thi matter
of the hebrew girl with the big ey who chanc to have thrown a spell
upon him that wa hi illfortun noth more amongst the mani women
with whom thei believ he fill hi hous as wa the wai of princ
it wa not strang that on favourit should be a witch inde i am
certain that onli becaus he wa known to love her wa merapi save
from death by poison or in some other secret fashion at ani rate for a
while
now came the glad tide that the pride of pharaoh wa broken at last
for hi firstborn child had di with the other or that the cloud
of mad had lift from hi brain whichev it might be and that he
had decre that the children of israel might depart from egypt when
and whither thei would then the peopl breath again see hope that
their miseri might end
it wa at thi time that jabez appear onc more at memphi drive a
number of chariot hors which he said he wish to sell to the princ
as he did not desir them to pass into ani other hand he wa admit
and state the price of hi hors accord to which thei must have
been beast of great valu
why do you wish to sell your hors ask seti
becaus i go with my peopl into land where there is littl water and
there thei might die o princ
i will bui the hors see to it ana said seti although i knew well
that alreadi he had more than he need
the princ rose to show that the interview wa end whereon jabez who
wa bow hi thank said hurriedli
i rejoic to learn o royal on that thing have befallen as i
foretold or rather wa bidden to foretel and that the troubl which
have afflict egypt have pass by your dwell
then you rejoic to learn a falsehood hebrew sinc the worst of those
troubl ha made it home here my son is dead and he turn awai
jabez lift hi shifti ey from the floor and glanc at him
princ he said i know and griev becaus thi loss ha cut you to
the heart yet it wa no fault of mine or of my peopl if you think
you will rememb that both when i built a wall of protect about
thi place becaus of your good deed to israel o princ and befor
i warn and caus you to be warn that if you and my niec moon of
israel came togeth a great troubl might fall on you through her who
have becom the woman of an egyptian in defianc of command must bear
the fate of egyptian women
it mai be so said the princ the matter is not on of which i care
to talk if thi death were wrought by the magic of your wizard i have
onli thi to saythat it is an ill payment to me in return for all that
i have striven to do on behalf of the hebrew yet what els could i
expect from such a peopl in such a world farewel
on prayer o princ i would ask your leav to speak with my niec
merapi
she is veil sinc the murder of her child by wizardri she see no
man
still i think she will see her uncl o princ
what then do you wish to sai to her
o princ through the clemenc of pharaoh we poor slave ar about to
leav the land of egypt never to return therefor if my niec remain
behind it is natur that i should wish to bid her farewel and to
confid to her certain matter connect with our race and famili which
she might desir to pass on to her children
now when he heard thi word children seti soften
i do not trust you he said you mai be charg with more of your
hebrew curs against merapi or you mai sai word to her that will make
her even unhappi than she is yet if you would wish to see her in my
presenc
my lord princ i will not troubl you so far farewel be pleas to
convei
or if that doe not suit you interrupt seti in the presenc of
ana here you can do so unless she refus to receiv you
jabez reflect for a moment and answer
then in the presenc of ana let it be sinc he is a man who know when
to be silent
jabez made obeis and depart and at a sign from the princ i
follow him present we were usher into the chamber of the ladi
merapi where she sat look most sad and lone with a veil of black
upon her head
greet my uncl she said after glanc at me whose presenc
i think she understood ar you the bearer of more propheci i prai
not sinc your last were overtru and she touch the black veil with
her finger
i am the bearer of tide and of a prayer niec the tide ar
that the peopl of israel ar about to leav egypt the prayer which is
also a command isthat you make readi to accompani them
to laban she ask look up
no my niec laban would not wish as a wife on who ha been the
mistress of an egyptian but to plai your part howev humbl in the
fortun of our peopl
i am glad that laban doe not wish what he never could obtain my
uncl tell me i prai you why should i hearken to thi prayer or thi
command
for a good reason niecethat your life hang on it heretofor you
have been suffer to take your heart desir but if you bide in egypt
where you have no longer a mission to fulfil have done all that wa
sought of you in keep with the mind of your lover the princ seti
true to the caus of israel you will sure die
you mean that our peopl will kill me
no not our peopl still you will die
she took a step toward him and look him in the ey
you ar certain that i shall die my uncl
i am or at least other ar certain
now she laugh it wa the first time i had seen her laugh for sever
moon
then i will stai here she said
jabez stare at her
i thought that you love thi egyptian who inde is worthi of ani
woman love he mutter into hi beard
perhap it is becaus i love him that i wish to die i have given him
all i have to give there is noth left of my poor treasur except
what will bring troubl and misfortun on hi head therefor the
greater the loveand it is more great than all those pyramid mass to
oneth greater the need that it should be buri for a while do you
understand
he shook hi head
i understand onli that you ar a veri strang woman differ from ani
other that i have known
my child who wa slain with the rest wa all the world to me and i
would be where he is do you understand now
you would leav your life in which be young you mai have more
children to lie in a tomb with your dead son he ask slowli like
on astonish
i onli care for life while it can serv him whom i love and if a dai
come when he sit upon the throne how will a daughter of the hate
israelit serv him then also i do not wish for more children live
or dead he that is gone own all my heart there is no room in it for
other that love at least is pure and perfect and have been embalm
by death can never chang moreov it is not in a tomb that i shall
lie with him or so i believ the faith of these egyptian which we
despis tell of a life etern in the heaven and thither i would
go to seek that which is lost and to wait that which is left behind
awhil
ah said jabez for my part i do not troubl myself with these
problem who find in a life tempor on the earth enough to fill my
thought and hand yet merapi you ar a rebel and whether in heaven
or on earth how ar rebel receiv by the king against whom thei have
rebel
you sai i am rebel she said turn on him with flash ey why
becaus i would not dishonour myself by marri a man i hate on also
who is a murder and becaus while i live i will not desert a man whom
i love to return to those who have done me naught but evil did god then
make women to be sold like cattl of the field for the pleasur and the
profit of him who can pai the highest
it seem so said jabez spread out hi hand
it seem that you think so who fashion god as you would wish him to
be but for my part i do not believ it and if i did i should seek
anoth king my uncl i appeal from the priest and the elder to that
which made both them and me and by it judgment i will stand or fall
alwai a veri danger thing to do reflect jabez aloud sinc the
priest is apt to take the law into hi own hand befor the caus can
be plead elsewher still who am i that i should set up my reason
against on who can grind amon to powder in hi own sanctuari and who
therefor mai have warrant for all she think and doe
merapi stamp her foot
you know well it wa you who brought me the command to dare the god
amon in hi templ it wa not i she began
i do know repli jabez wave hi hand i know also that is what
everi wizard sai whatev hi nation or hi god and what no on ever
believ thu becaus have faith you obei the command and through
you amon wa smitten among both the israelit and the egyptian you
ar held to be the greatest sorceress that ha look upon the nile and
that is a danger reput my niec
on to which i lai no claim and never sought
just so but which all the same ha come to you well know as
without doubt you do all that will soon befal in egypt and have been
warn if you need warn of the danger with which you yourself ar
threaten you still refus to obei thi second command which it is my
duti to deliv to you

then on your own head be it and farewel oh i would add that there
is a certain properti in cattl and the fruit of land which descend
to you from your father in the event of your death
take it all uncl and mai it prosper you farewel
a great woman friend ana and a beauti said the old hebrew after

my niec of whom i am fond now i too must be go have complet my
errand all good fortun to you ana you ar no longer a soldier ar

see that i have serv you as best i could and your master also who
i hope will soon find again that which he lost awhil ago
her high princess userti i suggest
the princess userti among other thing ana tell the princ if he
should deem them costli that those hors which i sold him ar realli
of the finest syrian blood and of a strain that my famili ha own for

moon especi if pharaoh be in command nai i know noth but it
is a season of great storm farewel friend ana and again farewel
now what did he mean by that thought i to myself as i depart to
make my report to seti but no answer to the question rose in my mind
veri soon i began to understand it appear that at length the
israelit were leav egypt a vast hord of them and with them ten
of thousand of arab of variou tribe who worship their god
and were some of them descend from the peopl of the hykso the
shepherd who onc rule in egypt that thi wa true wa prove to us
by the tide which reach us that all the hebrew women who dwelt in
memphi even those of them who were marri to egyptian had depart
from the citi leav behind them their men and sometim their
children inde befor these went certain of them who had been
friend visit merapi and ask her if she were not come also she
shook her head as she repli
why do you go ar you so fond of journei in the desert that for
the sake of them you ar readi never again to look upon the men you love
and the children of your bodi
no ladi thei answer weep we ar happi here in whitewal
memphi and here listen to the murmur of the nile we would grow
old and die rather than strive to keep hous in some desert tent with a
stranger or alon yet fear drive us henc
fear of what
of the egyptian who when thei come to understand all that thei have
suffer at our hand in return for the wealth and shelter which thei
have given us for mani gener wherebi we have grown from a hand
into a great peopl will certainli kill ani israelit whom thei find
left among them also we fear the curs of our priest who bid us to
depart
then i should fear these thing also said merapi
not so ladi see that be the onli belov of the princ of egypt
who rumour tell us will soon be pharaoh of egypt by him you will
be protect from the anger of the egyptian and be as we all know
well the greatest sorceress in the world the overthrow of amonra
the mighti and on who by sacrif her child wa abl to ward awai
everi plagu from the household where she dwelt you have naught to fear
from priest and their magic
then merapi sprang up bid them to leav her to her fate and to
be gone to their own which thei did hastili enough fear lest she
should cast some spell upon them so it came about that present the
fair moon of israel and certain children of mix blood were all of the
hebrew race that were left in egypt then notwithstand the miseri
and misfortun that dure the past few year by terror death and
famin had reduc them to perhap on half of their number the peopl
of egypt rejoic with a great joi
in everi templ of everi god process were held and offer made by
those who had anyth left to offer while the statu of the god were
dress in fine new garment and hung about with garland of flower
moreov on the nile and on the sacr lake boat float to and
fro adorn with lantern as at the feast of the rise of osiri as
titular highpriest of amon an offic of which he could not be depriv
while he live princ seti attend these demonstr which inde
he must do in the great templ of memphi whither i accompani him
when the ceremoni were over he led the process through the mass
of the worshipp clad in hi splendid sacerdot robe whereon everi
throat of the thousand present there greet him in a shout of thunder
as pharaoh or at least as pharaoh heir
when at length the shout di he turn upon them and said
friend if you would send me to be of the compani that sit at the
tabl of osiri and not at pharaoh feast you will repeat thi
foolish greet whereof our lord amenmes will hear with littl joi
in the silenc that follow a voic call out
have no fear o princ while the hebrew witch sleep night by night
upon your bosom she who could smite egypt with so mani plagu can
certainli shelter you from harm whereon the roar of acclam went
up again
it wa on the follow dai that bakenkhonsu the ag return with more
tide from tani where he had been upon a visit it seem that a
great council had been held there in the largest hall of on of the
largest templ at thi council which wa open to all the peopl
amenmes had given report on the matter of the israelit who he
state were depart in their thousand also offer were made to
appeas the angri god of egypt when the ceremoni wa finish but
befor the compani broke up in a heavi mood her high the princess
userti rose in her place and address pharaoh
by the spirit of our father she cri and more especi by that
of the good god meneptah my begett i ask of you pharaoh and i ask
of you o peopl whether the affront that ha been put upon us by these
hebrew slave and their magician is on that the proud land of egypt
should be call upon to bear our god have been smitten and defi
woe great and terribl such as histori tell not of have fallen
upon us through magic ten of thousand from the firstborn child of
pharaoh down have perish in a singl night and now these hebrew
who have murder them by sorceri for thei ar sorcer all men and
women togeth especi on of them who sit at memphi of whom i
will not speak becaus she ha wrought me privat harm by the decre
of pharaoh ar to be suffer to leav the land more thei ar to take
with them all their cattl all their thresh corn all the treasur
thei have hoard for gener and all the ornament of price and
wealth that thei have wrung by terror from our own peopl borrow
that which thei never purpos to return therefor i the royal princess
of egypt would ask of pharaoh is thi the decre of pharaoh
now said bakenkhonsu pharaoh sat with hang head upon hi throne
and made no answer
pharaoh doe not speak went on userti then i ask is thi the
decre of the council of pharaoh and of the peopl of egypt there
is still a great armi in egypt hundr of chariot and thousand of
footmen is thi armi to sit still while these slave depart into the
desert there to rous our enemi of syria against us and return with
them to butcher us
at these word continu bakenkhonsu from all that multitud there
went up a shout of no
the peopl sai no what saith pharaoh cri userti
there follow a silenc till suddenli amenmes rose and spoke
have it as you will princess and on your head and the head of all
these whom you have stir up let the evil fall if evil come though
i think it is your husband the princ seti who should stand where you
stand and put up thi prayer in your place
my husband the princ seti is ti to memphi by a rope of witch
hair or so thei tell me she sneer while the peopl murmur in
assent
i know not went on amenmes but thi i know that alwai the princ
would have let these hebrew go from among us and at time as sorrow
follow sorrow i have thought that he wa right truli more than onc
i also would have let them go but ever some strength i know not what
descend on my heart turn it to stone and wrung from me word that
i did not desir to utter even now i would let them go but all of you
ar against me and perchanc if i withstand you i shall pai for it
with my life and throne captain command that my armi be made readi
and let them assembl here at tani that i myself mai lead them after
the peopl of israel and share their danger
then with a mighti shout the compani broke up so that at the last
all were gone and onli pharaoh remain seat upon hi throne stare
at the ground with the air said bakenkhonsu rather of on who is dead
than of a live king about to wage war upon hi foe
to all these word the princ listen in silenc but when thei were
finish he look up and ask
what think you bakenkhonsu
i think o princ answer the wise old man that her high did
ill to stir up thi matter though doubtless she spoke with the voic
of the priest and of the armi against which pharaoh wa not strong
enough to stand
what you think i think said seti
at thi moment the ladi merapi enter
i hear my lord she said that pharaoh purpos to pursu the peopl
of israel with hi host i come to prai my lord that he will not join
himself to the host of pharaoh
it is but natur ladi that you should not wish me to make war upon
your kin and to speak truth i have no mind that wai repli seti
and turn left the chamber with her
she is not think of her king but of her lover life said
bakenkhonsu she is not a witch as thei declar but it is true that
she know what we do not
ye i answer it is true
chapter xvii
the dream of merapi
a while went by it mai have been fourteen dai dure which we heard
that the israelit had start on their journei thei were a mighti
multitud who bore with them the coffin and the mummi of their prophet
a man of their blood vizier it is report to that pharaoh who
welcom them to egypt hundr of year befor some said thei went
thi wai and some that but bakenkhonsu who knew everyth declar
that thei were head for the lake of crocodil which other name sea
of reed wherebi thei would cross into the desert beyond and thenc to
syria i ask him how see that at it narrowest part thi lake
wa six thousand pace in width and that the depth of it mud wa
unfathom he repli that he did not know but that i might do well
to inquir of the ladi merapi
so you have chang your mind and also think her a witch i said to
which he answer
on must breath the wind that blow and egypt is so full of
witchcraft that it is difficult to sai also it wa she and no other
who destroi the ancient statu of amon oh ye witch or no witch
it might be well to ask her how her peopl purpos to cross the sea of
reed especi if pharaoh chariot chanc to be behind them
so i did ask her but she answer that she knew noth of the matter
and wish to know noth see that she had separ from her
peopl and remain in egypt
then ki came i know not whenc and have made hi peac with seti as
to the dress of merapi in the robe of isi which he vow wa done
by the priest against hi wish told us that pharaoh and a great host
had start to pursu the israelit the princ ask him why he had
not gone with the host to which he repli that he wa no soldier also
that pharaoh hid hi face from him in return he ask the princ why
he had not gone
seti answer becaus had been depriv of hi command with hi other
offic and had no wish to take share in thi busi as a privat
citizen
you ar wise as alwai princ said ki
it wa on the follow night veri late while the princ ki
bakenkhonsu and i ana sat talk that suddenli the ladi merapi broke
in upon us as she had risen from her bed wildei and with her hair
flow down her robe
i have dream a dream she cri i dream that i saw all the
thousand of my peopl follow after a flame that burn from earth
to heaven thei came to the edg of a great water and behind them rush
pharaoh and all the host of the egyptian then my peopl ran on to the
face of the water and it bore them as though it were sound land
now the soldier of the pharaoh were follow but the god of egypt
appear amon osiri horu isi hathor and the rest and would
have turn them back still thei refus to listen and drag the
god with them rush out upon the water then dark fell and in
the dark sound of wail and of a mighti laughter it pass
the moon rose shine upon empti i awok trembl in my limb
interpret me thi dream if you can o ki master of magic
where is the need ladi he answer awak as though from sleep
when the dreamer is also the seer shall the pupil ventur to
instruct the teacher or the novic to make plain the mysteri to the
highpriestess of the templ nai ladi i and all the magician of
egypt ar beneath your feet
why will you ever mock me she said and as she spoke she shiver
then bakenkhonsu open hi lip sai
the wisdom of ki ha been buri in a cloud of late and give no light
to us hi discipl yet the mean of thi dream is plain though
whether it be also true i do not know it is that all the host of egypt
and with it the god of egypt ar threaten with destruct becaus
of the israelit unless on to whom thei will hearken can be found to
turn them from some purpos that i do not understand but to whom will
the mad hearken oh to whom will thei hearken and lift hi great
head he look straight at the princ
not to me i fear who now am no on in egypt said seti
why not to you o princ who tomorrow mai be everyon in egypt
ask bakenkhonsu alwai you have plead the caus of the hebrew
and said that naught but evil would befal egypt becaus of them as
ha happen to whom then will the peopl and the armi listen more
readili
moreov o princ broke in ki a ladi of your household ha dream
a veri evil dream of which if naught be said it might be held that it
wa no dream but a spell of power aim against the majesti of egypt
such a spell as that which cast great amon from hi throne such a spell
as that which ha set a magic fenc around thi hous and field
again i tell you that i weav no spell o ki who with my own child
have paid the price of them
yet spell were woven ladi and ha been known from of old strength
is perfect in sacrific alon ki answer darkli
have done with your talk of spell magician exclaim the princ
or if you must speak of them speak of your own which ar mani it wa
jabez who protect us here against the plagu and the statu of amon
wa shatter by some god
i ask your pardon princ said ki bow it wa not thi ladi but
her uncl who fenc your hous against the plagu which ravag egypt
and it wa not thi ladi but some god work in her which overthrew
amon of tani the princ ha said it yet thi ladi ha dream a
certain dream which bakenkhonsu ha interpret although i cannot and i
think that pharaoh and hi captain should be told of the dream that on
it thei mai form their own judgment
then why do you not tell them ki
it ha pleas pharaoh o princ to dismiss me from hi servic as
on who fail and to give my offic of kherheb to anoth if i appear
befor the face of pharaoh i shall be kill
now i ana listen wish that ki would appear befor the face of
pharaoh although i did not believ that he could be kill by him or by
anybodi els sinc against death he had charm for i wa afraid of ki
and felt in myself that again he wa plot evil to merapi whom i knew
to be innoc
the princ walk up and down the chamber as wa hi fashion when lost
in thought present he stop opposit to me and said
friend ana be pleas to command that my chariot be made readi with
a gener escort of a hundr men and spare hors to each chariot
we ride at dawn you and i to seek out the armi of pharaoh and prai
audienc of pharaoh
my lord said merapi in a kind of cry i prai you go not leav me
alon
why should i leav you ladi come with me if you will she shook her
head sai
i dare not princ there ha been some charm upon me of late that
draw me back to my own peopl twice in the night i have awaken and
found myself in the garden with my face set toward the north and
heard a voic in my ear even that of my father who is dead sai
moon of israel thy peopl wander in the wilder and need thy
light
it is certain therefor that if i came near to them i should be drag
down as wood is drag of an eddi nor would egypt see me ani more
then i prai you bide where you ar merapi said the princ laugh
a littl sinc it is certain that where you go i must follow who have
no desir to wander in the wilder with your hebrew folk well it
seem that as you do not wish to leav memphi and will not come with
me i must stai with you
ki fix hi pierc ey upon the pair of them
let the princ forgiv me he said but i swear it by the god that
never did i think to live to hear the princ seti meneptah set a woman
whim befor hi honour
your word ar rough said seti draw himself up and had thei
been spoken in other dai mayhap ki
oh my lord said ki prostrat himself till hi forehead touch the
ground bethink you then how great must be the need which make me dare
to speak them when first i came hither from the court of tani the
spirit that is within me speak through my lip gave certain titl
to your high for which your high wa pleas to reprov me
yet the spirit in me cannot lie and i know well and bid all here make
record of my word that tonight i stand in the presenc of him who er
two moon have pass will be crown pharaoh
truli you were ever a bearer of illtid ki but if so what of
it
thi your high were it not that the spirit of truth and right
compel me for their own reason should i who have blood that can be
shed or bone that can be broken dare to hurl hard word at him who
will be pharaoh should i dare to cross the will of the sweet dove who
nestl on hi heart the wise white dove that murmur the mysteri
of heaven whenc she came and is stronger than the vultur of isi and
swifter than the hawk of ra the dove that were she angri could rend
me into more fragment than did set osiri
now i saw bakenkhonsu begin to swell with inward laughter like a frog
about to croak but seti answer in a weari voic
by all the bird of egypt with the sacr crocodil thrown in i do
not know sinc that mind of your ki is not an open write which can
be read by the passerbi still if you would tell me what is the reason
with which the goddess of truth and justic have inspir you
the reason is o princ that the fate of all egypt armi mai be
hidden in your hand the time is short and i will be plain deni it as
she will thi ladi here who seem to be but a thing of love and beauti
is the greatest sorceress in egypt as i whom she ha master know
well she match herself against the high god of egypt and smote him to
the dust and ha paid back upon him hi prophet and hi worshipp
the ill that he would have work to her as in the like case ani of
our fellowship would do now she ha dream a dream or her spirit ha
told her that the armi of egypt is in danger of destruct and i know
that thi dream is true hasten then o princ to save the host of
egypt which you will sure need when you come to sit upon it throne
i am no sorceress cri merapi and yetala that i must sai
itthi smilingfeatur coldei wizard word ar true the sword
of death hang over the host of egypt
command that the chariot be made readi said seti again
eight dai had gone by it wa sunset and we drew rein over against the
sea of reed dai and night we had follow the armi of pharaoh across
the wilder on a road beaten down by hi chariot wheel and soldier
and by the ten of thousand of the israelit who had pass that wai
befor them now from the ridg where we had halt we saw it encamp
beneath us a veri great armi moreov straggler told us that beyond
also encamp wa the countless hord of the israelit and beyond
these the vast sea of reed which bar their path but we could
not see them for a veri strang reason between these and the armi
of pharaoh rose a black wall of cloud built as it were from earth to
heaven on of those straggler of whom i have spoken told us that thi
cloud travel befor the israelit by dai but at night wa turn
into a pillar of fire onli on thi dai when the armi of pharaoh
approach it had move round and come between the peopl of israel and
the armi
now when the princ bakenkhonsu and i heard these thing we look at
each other and were silent onli present the princ laugh a littl
and said
we should have brought ki with us even if we had to carri him bound
that he might interpret thi marvel for it is sure that no on els
can
it would be hard to keep ki bound princ if he wish to go free
answer bakenkhonsu moreov befor ever we enter the chariot at
memphi he had depart south for thebe i saw him go
and i gave order that he should not be allow to return for i hold
him an ill guest or so think the ladi merapi repli seti with a
sigh
now that we ar here what would the princ do i ask
descend to the camp of pharaoh and sai what we have to sai ana
and if he will not listen princ
then cry our messag aloud and return
and if he will not suffer us to return princ
then stand still and live or die as the god mai decre
truli our lord ha a great heart exclaim bakenkhonsu and though
i feel over young to die i am mind to see the end of thi matter with
him and he laugh aloud
but i who wa afraid thought that ohoho of hi which the sky seem
to echo back upon our head a strang and inde a fear sound
then we put on robe of ceremoni that we had brought with us but
neither sword nor armour and have eaten some food drove on with the
half of our guard toward the place where we saw the banner of pharaoh
fly about hi pavilion the rest of our guard we left encamp
bid them if aught happen to us to return and make report at
memphi and in the other great citi as we drew near to the camp the
outpost saw us and challeng but when thei perceiv by the light of
the set sun who it wa that thei challeng a murmur went through
them of
the princ of egypt the princ of egypt for so thei had never ceas
to name seti and thei salut with their spear and let us pass
so at length we came to the pavilion of pharaoh round about which
a whole regiment stood on guard the side of it were loop up high
becaus of the heat of the night which wa great and within sat
pharaoh hi captain hi councillor hi priest hi magician and
mani other at meat or serv food and drink thei sat at a tabl that
wa bent like a bow with their face toward the entranc and pharaoh
wa in the centr of the tabl with hi fanbear and butler behind
him
we advanc into the pavilion the princ in the centr bakenkhonsu
lean on hi staff on the right hand and i wear the gold chain
that pharaoh meneptah had given me on the left but those with us
remain among the guard at the entranc
who ar these ask amenmes look up who come here unbidden
three citizen of egypt who have a messag for pharaoh answer seti

time

becaus of the matter of these israelit who in my judgment had been
evilli dealt by and should be suffer to leav our land the good
god meneptah be so advis by you and other o pharaoh would have
smitten the israelit with the sword make an end of them and to
thi he demand my assent as the heir of egypt i refus that assent
and wa cast out and sinc then you o pharaoh have worn the doubl
crown while i have dwelt as a citizen of memphi live upon such
land and revenu as ar my own between that hour and thi o pharaoh
mani grief have smitten egypt and the last of them cost you your
firstborn and me mine yet through them all o pharaoh you have
refus to let these hebrew go as i counsel should be done at the
begin at length after the death of the firstborn your decre wa
issu that thei might go yet now you follow them with a great armi and
purpos to do to them what my father the good god meneptah would have
done had i consent namelyto destroi them with the sword hear me
pharaoh
i hear also the case is well if briefli set what els would the
princ seti sai
thi o pharaoh that i prai you to return with all your host from
the follow of these hebrew not tomorrow or the next dai but at
oncethi night
why o princ
becaus of a certain dream that a ladi of my household who is hebrew
ha dream which dream foretel destruct to you and the armi of
egypt unless you hearken to these word of mine
i think that we know of thi snake whom you have taken to dwell in your
bosom whenc it mai spit poison upon egypt it is name merapi moon of
israel is it not
that is the name of the ladi who dream the dream repli seti in a
cold voic though i felt him trembl with anger at my side the dream
that if pharaoh will my companion here shall set out word for word to
hi magician
pharaoh doe not will it shout amenmes smite the board with hi
fist becaus pharaoh know that it is but anoth trick to save these
wizard and thiev from the doom that thei have earn
am i then a worker of trick o pharaoh if i had been such why have
i journei hither to give warn when by sit yonder at memphi
tomorrow i might onc more have becom heir to the doubl crown for
if you will not hearken to me i tell you that veri soon you shall
be dead and with you theseand he point to all those who sat at
tableand with them the great armi that li without er you speak
tell me what is that black cloud which stand befor the camp of the
hebrew is there no answer then i will give you the answer it is the
pall that shall wrap the bone of everi on of you
now the compani shiver with fear ye even the priest and the
magician shiver but pharaoh went mad with rage spring from hi
seat he snatch at the doubl crown upon hi head and hurl it to
the ground and i note that the golden uru band about it roll
awai and rest upon seti sandal foot he tore hi robe and
shout
at least our fate shall be your fate renegad who have sold egypt
to the hebrew witch in payment of her kiss seiz thi man and hi
companion and when we go down to battl against these israelit
tomorrow after the dark lift let them be set with the captain of
the van so shall the truth be known at last
thu pharaoh command and seti answer noth fold hi arm
upon hi breast and wait
men rose from their seat as though to obei pharaoh and sank back to
them again guard start forward and yet remain stand where thei
were then bakenkhonsu burst into on of hi great laugh
ohoho he laugh pharaoh have i seen come and go on and two
and three and four and five but never yet have i seen a pharaoh whom
none of hi councillor or guard could obei howev much thei will
it when you ar pharaoh princ seti mai your luck be better your
arm ana my friend and lead on royal heir of egypt the truth is
shown to blind ey that will not see the word is spoken to deaf ear
that will not hearken and the duti done night fall sleep ye well ye
bidden of osiri sleep ye well
then we turn and walk from that pavilion at it entranc i look
back and in the low light that preced the dark it seem to me
as though all seat there were alreadi dead blue were their face and
hollow shone their ey and from their lip there came no word onli
thei stare at us as we went and stare and stare again
without the door of the pavilion by command of the princ i call
aloud the substanc of the ladi merapi dream and warn all within
earshot to ceas from pursu the peopl of israel if thei would
continu to live to look upon the sun yet even now although to speak
thu wa treason against pharaoh none lift a hand against the princ
or against me hi servant often sinc then i have wonder why thi wa
so and found no answer to my question mayhap it wa becaus of the
majesti of my master whom all knew to be the true pharaoh and love
at heart mayhap it wa becaus thei were sure that he would not have
travel so far and place himself in the power of amenmes save to
work the armi of egypt good and not ill and to bring them a messag
that had been spoken by the god themselv
or mayhap it wa becaus he wa still hedg about by that protect
which the hebrew had vow to him through their prophet with the
voic of jabez at least so it happen pharaoh might command but hi
servant would not obei moreov the stori spread and that night mani
desert from the host of pharaoh and encamp about us or fled back
toward the citi whenc thei came also with them were not a few
councillor and priest who had talk secretli with bakenkhonsu so it
chanc that even if pharaoh desir to make an end of us as perhap he
purpos to do in the midnight watch he thought it wisest to let the
matter lie until he had finish with the peopl of israel
it wa a veri strang night silent with a heavi stirless air there
were no star but the curtain of black cloud which seem to hang
beyond the camp of the egyptian wa aliv with lightn which
appear to shape themselv to letter that i could not read
behold the book of fate written in fire by the hand of god said
bakenkhonsu as he watch
about midnight a mighti east wind began to blow so strongli that we
must lie upon our face under the lea of the chariot then the wind
di awai and we heard tumult and shout both from the camp of
egypt and from the camp of israel beyond the cloud next there came a
shock as of earthquak which threw those of us who were stand to the
ground and by a bloodr moon that now appear we perceiv that all
the armi of pharaoh wa begin to move toward the sea
whither go thei i ask of the princ who clung to my arm
to doom i think he answer but to what doom i do not know
after thi we said no more becaus we were too much afraid
dawn came at last show the most aw sight that wa ever beheld by
the ey of man
the wall of cloud had disappear and in the clear light of the
morn we perceiv that the deep water of the sea of reed had
divid themselv leav a rais roadwai that seem to have
been clear by the wind or perchanc to have been thrown up by the
earthquak who can sai not i who never set foot upon that path of
death along thi wide road stream the ten of thousand of the
israelit pass between the water on the right hand and the water
on the left and after them follow all the armi of pharaoh save those
who had desert and stood or lai around us watch we could even
see the golden chariot that mark the presenc of pharaoh himself and
of hi bodyguard deep in the heart of the broken host that struggl
forward without disciplin or order
what now oh what now murmur seti and as he spoke there wa a
second shock of earthquak then to the west on the sea there aros a
mighti wave whereof the crest seem to be high as a pyramid it roll
forward with a curv and foam head and in the hollow of it for a
moment no more we saw the armi of egypt yet in that moment i seem
to see mighti shape flee landward along the crest of the wave
which shape i took to be the god of egypt pursu by a form of light
and glori that drove them as with a scourg thei came thei went
accompani by a sound of wail and the wave fell
but beyond it the hord of israel still marchedupon the further
shore
dens gloom follow and through the gloom i saw or thought i saw
merapi moon of israel stand befor us with a troubl face and
heard or thought i heard her cry
oh help me my lord seti help me my lord seti
then she too wa gone
har the chariot cri seti in a hollow voic
chapter xviii
the crown of merapi
fast as sped our hors rumour or rather the truth carri by those
who had gone befor us flew faster oh that journei wa as a dream
begotten by the evil god on we gallop through the dai and through
the night and lo at everi town and villag women rush upon us cry
is it true o travel is it true that pharaoh and hi host ar
perish in the sea
then old bakenkhonsu would call in answer
it is true that he who wa pharaoh and hi host ar perish in the
sea but lo here is he who is pharaoh and he point to the princ
who took no heed and said noth save
on on
then forward we would plung again till onc more the sound of wail
di into silenc
it wa sunset and at length we drew near to the gate of memphi the
princ turn to me and spoke
heretofor i have not dare to ask he said but tell me ana in the
gloom after the great cliff of water fell and the shape of terror swept
by did you seem to see a woman stand befor us and did you seem to hear
her speak
i did o princ
who wa that woman and what did she sai
she wa on who bore a child to you o princ which child is not and
she said oh help me my lord seti help me my lord seti
hi face grew ashen even beneath it veil of dust and he groan
two who love her have seen and two who love her have heard he said
there is no room for doubt ana she is dead
i prai the god
prai not for the god of egypt ar also dead slain by the god of

ten of thousand of the peopl we drove the hors at them
wai for pharaoh wai for the mighti on the good god seti meneptah
king of the upper and the lower land shout the escort
the peopl turn and saw the tall shape of the princ still clad in the
robe of state which he had worn when he stood befor amenmes in the
pavilion by the sea

and the cry pass on through memphi like a wind
now we were come to the centr of the place and there in front of the
great gate of the templ burn a vast pyre of wood befor the pyre
move figur in on of whom i knew ki dress in hi magician robe
outsid of these there wa a doubl circl of soldier who kept the
peopl back which these need for thei rave like madmen and shook
their fist a group of priest near the fire separ and i saw that
among them stood a man and a woman the latter with dishevel hair and
torn robe as though she had been roughli handl at thi moment her
strength seem to fail her and she sank to the ground lift her face
as she did so it wa the face of merapi moon of israel
so she wa not dead the man at her side stoop as though to lift her
up but a stone thrown out of the shadow struck him in the back and
caus him to straighten himself which he did with a curs at the
thrower i knew the voic at onc although the speaker wa disguis
it wa that of laban the israelit he who had been betroth to merapi
and had striven to murder us in the land of goshen what did he here i
wonder dimli
ki wa speak hark how the hebrew cat spit he said well
the caus ha been tri and the verdict given and i think that the
familiar should feed the flame befor the witch watch him now and
perhap he will chang into someth els
all thi he said smile in hi usual pleasant fashion even when he
made a sign to certain black templ slave who stood near thei leapt
forward and i saw the firelight shone upon their copper armlet as thei
grip laban he fought furious shout
where ar your armi egyptian and where is your dog of a pharaoh
go dig them from the sea of reed farewel moon of israel look how
your royal lover crown you at the last o faithless
he said no more for at thi moment the slave hurl him headlong into
the heart of the great fire which blacken for a littl and burn
bright again
then it wa that merapi struggl to her feet and cri in a ring
voic those veri word which the princ and i had seem to hear her
speak far awai by the sea of reedsoh help me my lord seti help me
my lord seti ye the same word which had echo in our ear dai
befor thei pass her lip or so we believ
now all thi while our chariot had been forc their wai foot by foot
through the wall of the watch crowd perhap while a man might count
a hundr no more as the echo of her cry di awai at length we were
through and leap to the ground
the witch call on on who sup tonight at the board of osiri with
pharaoh and hi host sneer ki well let her go to seek him there
if the guardian god will suffer it and again he made a sign to the
black slave
but merapi had seen or felt seti advanc from the shadow and see
flung herself upon hi breast he kiss her on the brow befor them
all then bade me hold her up and turn to face the peopl
bow down bow down bow down cri the deep voic of bakenkhonsu
life blood strength pharaoh pharaoh pharaoh and what he said the
escort echo
then of a sudden the multitud understood to their knee thei fell and
from everi side rose the ancient salut seti held up hi hand
and bless them watch i saw ki slip toward the dark and
whisper a word to the guard who sprang upon him and brought him
back
then the princ spoke
ye name me pharaoh peopl of memphi and pharaoh i fear i am by
descent of blood todai though whether i will consent to bear the
burden of govern should egypt wish it of me as yet i know not
still he who wore the doubl crown is i believ dead in the midst
of the sea at the least i saw the water overwhelm him and hi armi
therefor if onli for an hour i will be pharaoh that as pharaoh i mai
judg of certain matter ladi merapi tell me i prai you how came you
to thi pass
my lord she answer in a low voic after you had gone to warn the
armi of pharaoh becaus of that dream i dream ki who depart on
the same dai return again through on of the women of the household
over whom he had power or so i think he obtain access to me when i
wa alon in my chamber there he made me thi offer
give me he said the secret of your magic that i mai be aveng
upon the wizard of the hebrew who have brought about my downfal and
upon the hebrew themselv and also upon all my other enemi and

all your desir and make you and no other queen of egypt and be
your faith servant and that of your lord seti who shall be pharaoh
until the end of your live refus and i will stir up the peopl
against you and befor ever the princ return if he return at all
thei who believ you to be an evil sorceress shall mete out to you the
fate of a sorceress
my lord i answer to ki what i have often told him befor that i
had no magic to reveal to him i who knew noth of the black art of
sorceri see that it wa not i who destroi the statu of amon in
the templ at tani but that same power which sinc then ha brought
all the plagu on egypt i said too that i care noth for the
gift he offer to me as i had no wish to be queen of egypt my lord
he laugh in my face sai i should find that he wa on ill to mock
as other had found befor me then he point at me with hi wand and
mutter some spell over me which seem to numb my limb and voic
hold me helpless till he had been gone a long while and could not be
found by your servant whom i command in your name to seiz and keep
him till your return
from that hour the peopl began to threaten me thei crowd about the
palac gate in thousand cry dai and night that thei were go to
kill me the witch i prai for help but from me a sinner heaven
ha grown so far awai that my prayer seem to fall back unheard upon my
head even the servant in the palac turn against me and would not
look upon my face i grew mad with fear and loneli sinc all fled
befor me at last on night toward the dawn i went on to the terrac
and sinc no god would hear me i turn toward the north whither i
knew that you had gone and cri to you to help me in those same word
which i cri again just now befor you appear here the princ
look at me and i ana look at him then it wa that from among the
bush of the garden appear a man hidden in a long sheepskin cloak
so that i could not see hi face who said to me
moon of israel i have been sent by hi high the princ seti to
tell you that you ar in danger of your life as he is in danger of hi
wherefor he cannot come to you hi command is that you come to him
that togeth you mai flee awai out of egypt to a land where you will
both be safe until all these troubl ar finish
how know i that you of the veil face ar a true messeng i ask
give me a sign
then he held out to me that scarabu of lapislazuli which your
high gave to me far awai in the land of goshen the same that you
ask back from me as a love token when we plight troth and you gave
me your royal ring which scarabu i had seen in your robe when you
drove awai with ana
i lost it on our journei to the sea of reed but said noth of it to

that ki appear and stole it from me whisper the princ to me
it is not enough i answer thi jewel mai have been thiev
awai or snatch from the dead bodi of the princ or taken from him by
magic
the cloak man thought a while and said thi night not an hour ago

and such tide cannot travel thenc in an hour get you gone fals
tempter
yet it is so he answer
when you prove it to me i will believ and come

next dai a rumour began to run that thi aw thing had happen it
grew stronger and stronger until all swore that it had happen now
the furi of the peopl rose against me and thei raven round the
palac like lion of the desert roar for my blood yet it wa as
though thei could not enter here sinc whenev thei rush at the
gate or wall thei fell back again for some spirit seem to protect
the place the dai went by the night came again and at the dawn thi
dawn that is past onc more i stood upon the terrac and onc more the
cloak man appear from among the tree
now you have heard moon of israel he said and now you must
believ and come although you think yourself safe becaus at the
begin of the plagu thi the home of seti wa enchant against
evil so that none within it can be harm
i have heard and i think that i believ though how the tide
reach memphi in an hour i do not understand yet stranger i sai to
you that it is not enough
then the man drew a papyru roll from hi bosom and threw it at my
feet i open it and read the write wa the write of ana as i knew
well and the signatur wa the signatur of you my lord and it wa
seal with your seal and with the seal of bakenkhonsu as a wit
here it is and from the breast of her garment she drew out a roll and
gave it to me upon whom she rest all thi while
i open it and by the light of torch the princ bakenkhonsu and
i read it wa as she had told us in what seem to be my write and
sign and seal as she had said the word ran
to merapi moon of israel in my hous at memphi

i ceas for at that moment bakenkhonsu began to laugh
look at the letter he laugh look at the letter

to the colour of blood and then fade awai till present there wa
noth in my hand but a blank sheet of papyru
ohoho laugh bakenkhonsu truli friend ki you ar the first
