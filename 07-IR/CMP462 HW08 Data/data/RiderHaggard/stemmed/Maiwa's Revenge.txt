on dayit wa about a week after allan quatermain told me hi stori
of the three lion and of the move death of jimjimh and i were
walk home togeth on the termin of a dai shoot he own
about two thousand acr of shoot round the place he had bought in
yorkshir over a hundr of which were wood it wa the second year of
hi occup of the estat and alreadi he had rear a veri fair head
of pheasant for he wa an allround sportsman and as fond of shoot
with a shotgun as with an eightbor rifl we were three gun that
dai sir henri curti old quatermain and myself but sir henri wa
oblig to leav in the middl of the afternoon in order to meet
hi agent and inspect an outli farm where a new shed wa want
howev he wa come back to dinner and go to bring captain good
with him for braylei hall wa not more than two mile from the grang
we had met with veri fair sport consid that we were onli
go through outli cover for cock i think that we had kill
twentyseven a woodcock and a leash of partridg which we secur
out of a driven covei on our wai home there lai a long narrow spinnei
which wa a veri favourit lie for woodcock and gener held a
pheasant or two as well
well what do you sai said old quatermain shall we beat through
thi for a finish
i assent and he call to the keeper who wa follow with a littl
knot of beater and told him to beat the spinnei
veri well sir answer the man but it get wonder dark
and the wind rise a gale it will take you all your time to hit a
woodcock if the spinnei hold on
you show us the woodcock jeffri answer quatermain quickli for
he never like be cross in anyth to do with sport and we will
look after shoot them
the man turn and went rather sulkili i heard him sai to the
underkeep he pretti good the master is im not sai he isnt
but if he kill a woodcock in thi light and wind im a dutchman
i think that quatermain heard him too though he said noth the wind
wa rise everi minut and by the time the beat begun it blew big
gun i stood at the righthand corner of the spinnei which curv
round somewhat and quatermain stood at the left about forti pace from
me present an old cock pheasant came rocket over me look as
though the feather were be blown out of hi tail i miss him clean
with the first barrel and wa never more pleas with myself in my life
than when i doubl him up with the second for the shot wa not an
easi on in the faint light i could see quatermain nod hi head in
approv when through the groan of the tree i heard the shout of
the beater cock forward cock to the right then came a whole vollei
of shout woodcock to the right cock to the left cock over
i look up and present caught sight of on of the woodcock come
down the wind upon me like a flash in that dim light i could not follow
all hi movement as he zigzag through the nake treetop inde i
could see him when hi wing flit up now he wa pass mebang
and a flick of the wing i had miss him bang again sure he wa
down no there he went to my left
cock to you i shout step forward so as to get quatermain
between me and the faint angri light of the dy dai for i want to
see if he would wipe my ey i knew him to be a wonder shot but i
thought that cock would puzzl him
i saw him rais hi gun ever so littl and bend forward and at that
moment out flash two woodcock into the open the on i had miss to
hi right and the other to hi left
at the same time a fresh shout aros of woodcock over and look
down the spinnei i saw a third bird high up in the air be blown
along like a brown and whirl leaf straight over quatermain head
and then follow the prettiest littl bit of shoot that i ever saw
the bird to the right wa fly low not ten yard from the line of
a hedgerow and quatermain took him first becaus he would becom
invis the soonest of ani inde nobodi who had not hi hawk ey
could have seen to shoot at all but he saw the bird well enough to kill
it dead as a stone then turn sharpli he pull on the second bird
at about fortyf yard and over he went by thi time the third
woodcock wa nearli over him and fly veri high straight down the
wind a hundr feet up or more i should sai i saw him glanc at it as
he open hi gun threw out the right cartridg and slip in anoth
turn round as he did so by thi time the cock wa nearli fifti yard
awai from him and travel like a flash lift hi gun he fire
after it and wonder as the shot wa kill it dead a tear gust
of wind caught the dead bird and blew it awai like a leaf torn from an
oak so that it fell a hundr and thirti yard off or more
i sai quatermain i said to him when the beater were up do you
often do thi sort of thing
well he answer with a dry smile the last time i had to load
three shot as quickli as that wa at rather larger game it wa at
eleph i kill them all three as dead as i kill those woodcock
but it veri nearli went the other wai i can tell you i mean that thei
veri nearli kill me
just at that moment the keeper came up did you happen to get on of
them there cock sir he said with the air of a man who did not in
the least expect an answer in the affirm
well ye jeffri answer quatermain you will find on of them
by the hedg and anoth about fifti yard out by the plough there to
the left
the keeper had turn to go look a littl astonish when
quatermain call him back
stop a bit jeffri he said you see that pollard about on hundr
and forti yard off well there should be anoth woodcock down in a
line with it about sixti pace out in the field
well if that beant the veri smartest bit of shoot murmur
jeffri and depart
after that we went home and in due cours sir henri curti and captain
good arriv for dinner the latter arrai in the tightest and most
ornament dresssuit i ever saw i rememb that the waistcoat wa
adorn with five pink coral button
it wa a veri pleasant dinner old quatermain wa in an excel
humour induc i think by the recollect of hi triumph over the
doubt jeffri good too wa full of anecdot he told us a most
miracul stori of how he onc went shoot ibex in kashmir these
ibex accord to good he stalk earli and late for four entir dai
at last on the morn of the fifth dai he succeed in get within
rang of the flock which consist of a magnific old ram with horn
so long that i am afraid to mention their measur and five or six
femal good crawl upon hi stomach painfulli take shelter behind
rock till he wa within two hundr yard then he drew a fine bead
upon the old ram at thi moment howev a divers occur some
wander nativ of the hill appear upon a distant mountain top the
femal turn and rush over a rock vanish from good ken but
the old ram took a bolder cours in front of him stretch a mighti
crevass at least thirti feet in width he went at it with a bound
whilst he wa in midair good fire and kill him dead the ram turn
a complet somersault in space and fell in such fashion that hi horn
hook themselv upon a big project of the opposit cliff there he
hung till good after a long and pain dtour gracefulli drop a
lasso over him and fish him up
thi move tale of wild adventur wa receiv with undeserv
incredul
well said good if you fellow wont believ my stori when i tell
ita perfectli true stori mindperhap on of you will give us a
better im not particular if it is true or not and he laps into a
dignifi silenc
now quatermain i said dont let good beat you let us hear how you
kill those eleph you were talk about thi even just after
you shot the woodcock
well said quatermain dryli and with someth like a twinkl in
hi brown ey it is veri hard fortun for a man to have to follow on
good spoor inde if it were not for that run giraff which as
you will rememb curti we saw good bowl over with a martini rifl
at three hundr yard i should almost have said that thi wa an
imposs tale
here good look up with an air of indign innoc
howev he went on rise and light hi pipe if you fellow
like i will spin you a yarn i wa tell on of you the other night
about those three lion and how the lioness finish my unfortun
voorloop jimjim the boi whom we buri in the breadbag
well after thi littl experi i thought that i would settl down a
bit so i enter upon a ventur with a man who be of a specul
mind had conceiv the idea of run a store at pretoria upon
strictli cash principl the arrang wa that i should find
the capit and he the experi our partnership wa not of a long
durat the boer refus to pai cash and at the end of four month
my partner had the capit and i had the experi after thi i came
to the conclus that storekeep wa not in my line and have
four hundr pound left i sent my boi harri to a school in natal and
bui an outfit with what remain of the monei start upon a big
trip
thi time i determin to go further afield than i had ever been
befor so i took a passag for a few pound in a trade brig that
ran between durban and delagoa bai from delagoa bai i march inland
accompani by twenti porter with the idea of strike up north
toward the limpopo and keep parallel to the coast but at a
distanc of about on hundr and fifti mile from it for the first
twenti dai of our journei we suffer a good deal from fever that is
my men did for i think that i am fever proof also i wa hard put to
it to keep the camp in meat for although the countri prove to be veri
spars popul there wa but littl game about inde dure all
that time i hardli kill anyth larger than a waterbuck and as you
know waterbuck flesh is not veri appetis food on the twentieth
dai howev we came to the bank of a largish river the gonooroo it
wa call thi i cross and then struck inland toward a great rang
of mountain the blue crest of which we could see ly on the distant
heaven like a shadow a continu as i believ of the drakensberg
rang that skirt the coast of natal from thi main rang a great spur
shoot out some fifti mile or so toward the coast end abruptli in
on tremend peak thi spur i discov separ the territori of
two chief name nala and wamb wamb territori be to the north
and nala to the south nala rule a tribe of bastard zulu call
the butiana and wamb a much larger tribe call the matuku which
present mark bantu characterist for instanc thei have door and
verandah to their hut work skin perfectli and wear a waistcloth and
not a moocha at thi time the butiana were more or less subject to
the matuku have been surpris by them some twenti year befor
and mercilessli slaughter down the tribe wa now recov itself
howev and as you mai imagin it did not love the matuku
well i heard as i went along that eleph were veri plenti in the
dens forest which lie upon the slope and at the foot of the mountain
that border wamb territori also i heard a veri ill report of that
worthi himself who live in a kraal upon the side of the mountain
which wa so strongli fortifi as to be practic impregn it wa
said that he wa the most cruel chief in thi part of africa and that
he had murder in cold blood an entir parti of english gentlemen who
some seven year befor had gone into hi countri to hunt eleph
thei took an old friend of mine with them as guid john everi by name
and often had i mourn over hi untim death all the same wamb
or no wamb i determin to hunt eleph in hi countri i never wa
afraid of nativ and i wa not go to show the white feather now i
am a bit of a fatalist as you fellow know so i came to the conclus
that if it wa fate that wamb should send me to join my old friend
john everi i should have to go and there wa an end of it meanwhil
i meant to hunt eleph with a peac heart
on the third dai from the date of our sight the great peak we found
ourselv beneath it shadow still follow the cours of the river
which wound through the forest at the base of the peak we enter the
territori of the redoubt wamb thi howev wa not accomplish
without a certain differ of opinion between my bearer and myself
for when we reach the spot where wamb boundari wa suppos to run
the bearer sat down and emphat refus to go a step further i
sat down too and argu with them put my fatalist view befor
them as well as i wa abl but i could not persuad them to look at
the matter in the same light at present thei said their skin were
whole if thei went into wamb countri without hi leav thei would
soon be like a watereaten leaf it wa veri well for me to sai that
thi would be fate fate no doubt might be walk about in wamb
countri but while thei stop outsid thei would not meet him
well i said to gobo my head man and what do you mean to do
we mean to go back to the coast macumazahn he answer insol
do you i repli for my bile wa stir at ani rate mr gobo
you and on or two other will never get there see here my friend
and i took a repeat rifl and sat myself comfort down rest my
back against a treei have just breakfast and i had as soon spend
the dai here as anywher els now if you or ani of those men walk on
step back from here and toward the coast i shall fire at you and you
know that i dont miss
the man finger the spear he wa carryingluckili all my gun were
stack against the treeand then turn as though to walk awai the
other keep their ey fix upon him all the while i rose and
cover him with the rifl and though he kept up a brave appear of
unconcern i saw that he wa glanc nervous at me all the time when
he had gone about twenti yard i spoke veri quietli
now gobo i said come back or i shall fire
of cours thi wa take a veri high hand i had no real right to kill
gobo or anybodi els becaus thei object to run the risk of death by
enter the territori of a hostil chief but i felt that if i wish
to keep up ani author it wa absolut necessari that i should push
matter to the last extrem short of actual shoot him so i sat
there look fierc as a lion and keep the sight of my rifl in
a dead line for gobo rib then gobo feel that the situat wa
get strain gave in
dont shoot boss he shout throw up hi hand i will come
with you
i thought you would i answer quietli you see fate walk about
outsid wamb countri as well as in it
after that i had no more troubl for gobo wa the ringlead and when
he collaps the other collaps also harmoni be thu restor we
cross the line and on the follow morn i began shoot in good
earnest
iia morn sport
move some five or six mile round the base of the great peak of
which i have spoken we came the same dai to on of the fairest bit of
african countri that i have seen outsid of kukuanaland at thi spot
the mountain spur that run out at right angl to the great rang
which stretch it cloudclad length north and south as far as the ey
can reach sweep inward with a vast and splendid curv thi curv
measur some fiveandthirti mile from point to point and across
it moonlik segment the river flash a silver line of light on the
further side of the river is a measureless sea of swell ground a
natur park cover with great patch of bushsom of them be mani
squar mile in extent these ar separ on from anoth by glade
of grass land broken here and there with clump of timber tree and in
some instanc by curiou isol koppi and even by singl crag of
granit that start up into the air as though thei were monument carv
by man and not tombston set by natur over the grave of ag gone on
the west thi beauti plain is border by the lone mountain from
the edg of which it roll down toward the fever coast but how far it
run to the north i cannot sayeight dai journei accord to the
nativ when it is lost in an untravel morass
on the hither side of the river the sceneri is differ along the
edg of it bank where the land is flat ar green patch of swamp
then come a wide belt of beauti grass land cover thickli with
game and slope up veri gentli to the border of the forest which
begin at about a thousand feet abov the level of the plain cloth
the mountainsid almost to it crest in thi forest grow great tree
most of them of the yellowwood speci some of these tree ar so
lofti that a bird in their top branch would be out of rang of an
ordinari shot gun anoth peculiar thing about them is that thei ar
for the most part cover with a dens growth of the orchilla moss and
from thi moss the nativ manufactur a most excel deep purpl dye
with which thei stain tan hide and also cloth when thei happen
to get ani of the latter i do not think that i ever saw anyth more
remark than the appear of on of these mighti tree festoon
from top to bottom with trail wreath of thi sadhu moss in which
the wind whisper gentli as it stir them at a distanc it look like
the grai lock of a titan crown with bright green leav and here and
there star with the rich bloom of orchid
the night of that dai on which i had my littl differ of opinion
with gobo we camp by the edg of thi great forest and on the
follow morn at daylight i start out shoot as we were short
of meat i determin to kill a buffalo of which there were plenti
about befor look for trace of eleph not more than half a mile
from camp we came across a trail broad as a cartroad evid made by
a great herd of buffalo which had pass up at dawn from their feed
ground in the marsh to spend the dai in the cool air of the upland
thi trail i follow boldli for such wind as there wa blew straight
down the mountainsid that is from the direct in which the
buffalo had gone to me about a mile further on the forest began to
be dens and the natur of the trail show me that i must be close to
my game anoth two hundr yard and the bush wa so thick that had
it not been for the trail we could scarc have pass through it
as it wa gobo who carri my eightbor rifl for i had the
570express in my hand and the other two men whom i had taken with
me show the veri strongest dislik to go ani further point
out that there wa no room to run awai i told them that thei need
not come unless thei like but that i wa certainli go on and then
grow asham thei came
anoth fifti yard and the trail open into a littl glade i knelt
down and peep and peer but no buffalo could i see evid the
herd had broken up herei knew that from the spoorand penetr the
opposit bush in littl troop i cross the glade and choos on
line of spoor follow it for some sixti yard when it becam clear
to me that i wa surround by buffalo and yet so dens wa the
cover that i could not see ani a few yard to my left i could hear on
rub it horn against a tree while from my right came an occasion
low and throati grunt which told me that i wa uncomfort near an
old bull i crept on toward him with my heart in my mouth as gentli as
though i were walk upon egg for a bet lift everi littl bit of
wood in my path and place it behind me lest it should crack and warn
the game after me in singl file came my three retain and i dont
know which of them look the most frighten present gobo touch my
leg i glanc round and saw him point slantwis toward the left
i lift my head a littl and peep over a mass of creeper beyond the
creeper wa a dens bush of sharppoint alo of that kind of which
the leav project later and on the other side of the alo not
fifteen pace from us i made out the horn neck and the ridg of the
back of a tremend old bull i took my eightbor and get on
to my knee prepar to shoot him through the neck take my chanc of
cut hi spine i had alreadi cover him as well as the alo leav
would allow when he gave a kind of sigh and lai down
i look round in dismai what wa to be done now i could not see
to shoot him ly down even if my bullet would have pierc the
interven aloeswhich wa doubtfuland if i stood up he would either
run awai or charg me i reflect and came to the conclus that the
onli thing to do wa to lie down also for i did not fanci wander
after other buffalo in that dens bush if a buffalo li down it
is clear that he must get up again some time so it wa onli a case of
patiencefight the fight of sit down as the zulu sai
accordingli i sat down and light a pipe think that the smell of
it might reach the buffalo and make him get up but the wind wa the
wrong wai and it did not so when it wa done i lit anoth afterward
i had caus to regret that pipe
well we squat like thi for between half and three quarter of an
hour till at length i began to grow heartili sick of the perform
it wa about as dull a busi as the last hour of a comic opera
i could hear buffalo snort and move all round and see the
redbeak tic bird fly up off their back make a kind of hiss
as thei did so someth like that of the english misselthrush but i
could not see a singl buffalo as for my old bull i think he must have
slept the sleep of the just for he never even stir
just as i wa make up my mind that someth must be done to save the
situat my attent wa attract by a curiou grind nois
at first i thought that it must be a buffalo chew the cud but wa
oblig to abandon the idea becaus the nois wa too loud i shift
myself round and stare through the crack in the bush in the direct
whenc the sound seem to come and onc i thought that i saw someth
grai move about fifti yard off but could not make certain although
the grind nois still continu i could see noth more so i gave
up think about it and onc again turn my attent to the buffalo
present howev someth happen suddenli from about forti yard
awai there came a tremend snort sound more like that made by
an engin get a heavi train under weigh than anyth els in the
world
by jove i thought turn round in the direct from which the
grind sound had come that must be a rhinocero and he ha got our
wind for as you fellow know there is no mistak the sound made by
a rhinocero when he get wind of you
anoth second and i heard a most tremend crash nois befor i
could think what to do befor i could even get up the bush behind me
seem to burst asund and there appear not eight yard from us
the great horn and wick twinkl ey of a charg rhinocero he
had wind us or my pipe i do not know which and after the fashion
of these brute had charg up the scent i could not rise i could
not even get the gun up i had no time all that i wa abl to do wa
to roll over as far out of the monster path as the bush would allow
anoth second and he wa over me hi great bulk tower abov me
like a mountain and upon my word i could not get hi smell out of my
nostril for a week circumst impress it on my memori at least i
suppos so hi hot breath blew upon my face on of hi front feet just
miss my head and hi hind on actual trod upon the loos part of
my trouser and pinch a littl bit of my skin i saw him pass over me
ly as i wa upon my back and next second i saw someth els my
men were a littl behind me and therefor straight in the path of the
rhinocero on of them flung himself backward into the bush and thu
avoid him the second with a wild yell sprung to hi feet and bound
like an indiarubb ball right into the alo bush land well among
the spike but the third it wa my friend gobo could not by ani mean
get awai he manag to gain hi feet and that wa all the rhinocero
wa charg with hi head low hi horn pass between gobo leg
and feel someth on hi nose he jerk it up awai went gobo high
into the air he turn a complet somersault at the apex of the curv
and as he did so i caught sight of hi face it wa grai with terror
and hi mouth wa wide open down he came right on to the great brute
back and that broke hi fall luckili for him the rhinocero never
turn but crash straight through the alo bush onli miss the man
who had jump into it by about a yard
then follow a complic the sleep buffalo on the further side
of the bush hear the nois sprang to hi feet and for a second
not know what to do stood still at that instant the huge rhinocero
blunder right on to him and get hi horn beneath hi stomach gave
him such a fear dig that the buffalo wa turn over on to hi back
while hi assail went a most amaz cropper over hi carcas in
anoth moment howev the rhinocero wa up and wheel round
to the left crash through the bush downhil and toward the open
countri
instantli the whole place becam aliv with alarm sound in everi
direct troop of snort buffalo charg through the forest wild
with fright while the injur bull on the further side of the bush
began to bellow like a mad thing i lai quit still for a moment
devoutli prai that none of the fly buffalo would come my wai
then when the danger lessen i got on to my feet shook myself and
look round on of my boi he who had thrown himself backward into
the bush wa alreadi half wai up a treeif heaven had been at the top
of it he could not have climb quicker gobo wa ly close to me
groan vigor but as i suspect quit unhurt while from the
alo bush into which no 3 had bound like a tenni ball issu a
success of the most pierc yell
i look and saw that thi unfortun fellow wa in a veri tight
place a great spike of alo had run through the back of hi skin
waistbelt though without pierc hi flesh in such a fashion that it
wa imposs for him to move while within six feet of him the injur
buffalo bull think no doubt that he wa the aggressor bellow
and ramp to get at him tear the thick alo with hi great horn
that no time wa to be lost if i wish to save the man life wa
veri clear so seiz my eightbor which wa fortun uninjur i
took a pace to the left for the rhinocero had enlarg the hole in the
bush and aim at the point of the buffalo shoulder sinc on account
of my posit i could not get a fair side shot for the heart as i did
so i saw that the rhinocero had given the bull a tremend wound
in the stomach and that the shock of the encount had put hi left
hindleg out of joint at the hip i fire and the bullet strike the
shoulder broke it and knock the buffalo down i knew that he could
not get up ani more becaus he wa now injur fore and aft so
notwithstand hi terrif bellow i scrambl round to where he wa
there he lai glare furious and tear up the soil with hi horn
step up to within two yard of him i aim at the vertebra of hi
neck and fire the bullet struck true and with a thud he drop hi
head upon the ground groan and di
thi littl matter have been attend to with the assist of
gobo who had now found hi feet i went on to extric our unfortun
companion from the alo bush thi we found a thorni task but at last
he wa drag forth uninjur though in a veri piou and prayer
frame of mind hi spirit had certainli look that wai he said
or he would now have been dead as i never like to interfer with true
pieti i did not ventur to suggest that hi spirit had deign to make
us of my eightbor in hi interest
have despatch thi boi back to the camp to tell the bearer to come
and cut the buffalo up i bethought me that i ow that rhinocero a
grudg which i should love to repai so without sai a word of what
wa in my mind to gobo who wa now more than ever convinc that fate
walk about loos in wamb countri i just follow on the brute
spoor he had crash through the bush till he reach the littl glade
then moder hi pace somewhat he had follow the glade down it
entir length and onc more turn to the right through the forest
shape hi cours for the open land that li between the edg of the
bush and the river have follow him for a mile or so further i
found myself quit on the open i took out my glass and search
the plain about a mile ahead wa someth browna i thought the
rhinocero i advanc anoth quarter of a mile and look onc
moreit wa not the rhinocero but a big antheap thi wa puzzl
but i did not like to give it up becaus i knew from hi spoor that he
must be somewher ahead but as the wind wa blow straight from me
toward the line that he had follow and as a rhinocero can smell you
for about a mile it would not i felt be safe to follow hi trail
ani further so i made a dtour of a mile and more till i wa nearli
opposit the antheap and then onc more search the plain it wa no
good i could see noth of him and wa about to give it up and start
after some oryx i saw on the skylin when suddenli at a distanc of
about three hundr yard from the antheap and on it further side i
saw my rhino stand up in a patch of grass
heaven i thought to myself he off again but no after
stand stare for a minut or two he onc more lai down
now i found myself in a quandari as you know a rhinocero is a veri
shortsight brute inde hi sight is as bad as hi scent is good
of thi fact he is perfectli awar but he alwai make the most of hi
natur gift for instanc when he li down he invari doe so
with hi head down wind thu if ani enemi cross hi wind he will
still be abl to escap or attack him and if on the other hand the
danger approach up wind he will at least have a chanc of see it
otherwis by walk delic on might actual kick him up like a
partridg if onli the advanc wa made up wind
well the point wa how on earth should i get within shot of thi
rhinocero after much deliber i determin to try a side approach
think that in thi wai i might get a shoulder shot accordingli we
start in a crouch attitud i first gobo hold on to my coat
tail and the other boi on to gobo moocha i alwai adopt thi plan
when stalk big game for if you follow ani other system the bearer
will get out of line we arriv within three hundr yard safe
enough and then the real difficulti began the grass had been
so close eaten off by game that there wa scarc ani cover
consequ it wa necessari to go on to our hand and knee which
in my case involv lai down the eightbor at everi step and then
lift it up again howev i wriggl along somehow and if it had
not been for gobo and hi friend no doubt everyth would have gone
well but as you have i dare sai observ a nativ out stalk is
alwai of that mind which is suppos to actuat an ostrichso long as
hi head is hidden he seem to think that noth els can be seen so
it wa in thi instanc gobo and the other boi crept along on their
hand and toe with their head well down but though unfortun
i did not notic it till too late bear the fundament portion of
their frame high in the air now all anim ar quit as suspici of
thi end of mankind as thei ar of hi face and of that fact i soon had
a proof just when we had got within about two hundr yard and i wa
congratul myself that i had not had thi long crawl with the sun
beat on the back of my neck like a furnac for noth i heard the
hiss note of the rhinocero bird and up flew four or five of them
from the brute back where thei had been comfort emploi in
catch tic now thi perform on the part of the bird is to a
rhinocero what the word cave is to a schoolboyit put him on the
qui vive at onc befor the bird were well in the air i saw the
grass stir
down you go i whisper to the boi and as i did so the rhinocero
got up and glare suspici around but he could see noth inde
if we had been stand up i doubt if he would have seen us at that
distanc so he mere gave two or three sniff and then lai down hi
head still down wind the bird onc more settl on hi back
but it wa clear to me that he wa sleep with on ey open be
gener in a suspici and unchristian frame of mind and that it
wa useless to proce further on thi stalk so we quietli withdrew
to consid the posit and studi the ground the result were not
satisfactori there wa absolut no cover about except the antheap
which wa some three hundr yard from the rhinocero upon hi upwind
side i knew that if i tri to stalk him in front i should fail and so
i should if i attempt to do so from the further sideh or the bird
would see me so i came to a conclus i would go to the antheap
which would give him my wind and instead of stalk him i would let
him stalk me it wa a bold step and on which i should never advis a
hunter to take but somehow i felt as though rhino and i must plai the
hand out
i explain my intent to the men who both held up their arm in
horror their fear for my safeti were a littl mitig howev when
i told them that i did not expect them to come with me
gobo breath a prayer that i might not meet fate walk about and
the other on sincer trust that my spirit might look my wai when
the rhinocero charg and then thei both depart to a place of
safeti
take my eightbor and halfadozen spare cartridg in my pocket
i made a dtour and reach the antheap in safeti lai down for a
moment the wind had drop but present a gentl puff of air pass
over me and blew on toward the rhinocero by the wai i wonder what
it is that smell so strong about a man is it hi bodi or hi breath
i have never been abl to make out but i saw it state the other dai
that in the duck decoi the man who is work the duck hold a littl
piec of burn turf befor hi mouth and that if he doe thi thei
cannot smell him which look as though it were the breath well
whatev it wa about me that attract hi attent the rhinocero
soon smelt me for within half a minut after the puff of wind had
pass me he wa on hi leg and turn round to get hi head up wind
there he stood for a few second and snif and then he began to move
first of all at a trot then as the scent grew stronger at a furiou
gallop on he came snort like a runawai engin with hi tail stuck
straight up in the air if he had seen me lie down there he could not
have made a better line it wa rather nervou work i can tell you
ly there wait for hi onslaught for he look like a mountain of
flesh i determin howev not to fire till i could plainli see hi
ey for i think that rule alwai give on the right distanc for big
game so i rest my rifl on the antheap and wait for him kneel
at last when he wa about forti yard awai i saw that the time had
come and aim straight for the middl of the chest i pull
thud went the heavi bullet and with a tremend snort over roll
the rhinocero beneath it shock just like a shot rabbit but if i had
thought that he wa done for i wa mistaken for in anoth second he
wa up again and come at me as hard as ever onli with hi head held
low i wait till he wa within ten yard in the hope that he would
expos hi chest but he would do noth of the sort so i just had to
fire at hi head with the left barrel and take my chanc well as
luck would have it of cours the anim put it horn in the wai of the
bullet which cut clean through it about three inch abov the root and
then glanc off into space
after that thing got rather seriou my gun wa empti and the
rhinocero wa rapidli arriv so rapidli inde that i came to the
conclus that i had better make wai for him accordingli i jump
to my feet and ran to the right as hard as i could go as i did so he
arriv full tilt knock my friendli antheap flat and for the
third time that dai went a most magnific cropper thi gave me a few
second start and i ran down windmi word i did run unfortun
howev my modest retreat wa observ and the rhinocero as soon as
he had found hi leg again set to work to run after me now no man on
earth can run so fast as an irrit rhinocero can gallop and i knew
that he must soon catch me up but have some slight experi of
thi sort of thing luckili for myself i kept my head and as i fled
i manag to open my rifl get the old cartridg out and put in two
fresh on to do thi i wa oblig to steadi my pace a littl and by
the time that i had snap the rifl to i heard the beast snort and
thunder awai within a few pace of my back i stop and as i did
so rapidli cock the rifl and slu round upon my heel by thi time
the brute wa within six or seven yard of me but luckili hi head wa
up i lift the rifl and fire at him it wa a snap shot but the
bullet struck him in the chest within three inch of the first and
found it wai into hi lung it did not stop him howev so all i
could do wa to bound to on side which i did with surpris activ
and as he brush past me to fire the other barrel into hi side that
did for him the ball pass in behind the shoulder and right through
hi heart he fell over on to hi side gave on more aw squeala
dozen pig could not have made such a noiseand promptli di keep
hi wick ey wide open all the time
as for me i blew my nose and go up to the rhinocero sat on hi
head and reflect that i had done a capit morn shoot
iiith first round
after thi as it wa now middai and i had kill enough meat we
march back triumphantli to camp where i proceed to concoct a stew
of buffalo beef and compress veget when thi wa readi we at
the stew and then i took a nap about four oclock howev gobo
woke me up and told me that the head man of on of wamb kraal had
arriv to see me i order him to be brought up and present he
came a littl wizen talk old man with a waistcloth round hi
middl and a greasi frai kaross made of the skin of rock rabbit
over hi shoulder
i told him to sit down and then abus him roundli what did he
mean i ask by disturb me in thi rude wai how did he dare to
caus a person of my qualiti and evid import to be awaken in
order to interview hi entir contempt self
i spoke thu becaus i knew that it would produc an impress on him
nobodi except a realli great man he would argu would dare to speak
to him in that fashion most savag ar desper bulli at heart and
look on insol as a sign of power
the old man instantli collaps he wa utterli overcom he said
hi heart wa split in two and well realiz the extent of hi
misbehaviour but the occas wa veri urgent he heard that a mighti
hunter wa in the neighbourhood a beauti white man how beauti
he could not have imagin had he not seen thi to me and he came to
beg hi assist the truth wa that three bull eleph such as no
man ever saw had for year been the terror of their kraal which wa
but a small placea cattl kraal of the great chief wamb where thei
live to keep the cattl and now of late these eleph had done them
much damag but last night thei had destroi a whole patch of meali
land and he fear that if thei came back thei would all starv next
season for want of food would the mighti white man then be pleas to
come and kill the eleph it would be easi for him to dooh most
easi it wa onli necessari that he should hide himself in a tree for
there wa a full moon and then when the eleph appear he would
speak to them with the gun and thei would fall down dead and there
would be an end of their troubl
of cours i hum and haw and made a great favour of consent to
hi propos though realli i wa delight to have such a chanc on
of the condit that i made wa that a messeng should at onc be
despatch to wamb whose kraal wa two dai journei from where i wa
tell him that i propos to come and pai my respect to him in a few
dai and to ask hi formal permiss to shoot in hi countri also
i intim that i wa prepar to present him with hongo that is
blackmail and that i hope to do a littl trade with him in ivori of
which i heard he had a great quantiti
thi messag the old gentleman promis to despatch at onc though
there wa someth about hi manner which show me that he wa
doubt as to how it would be receiv after that we struck our camp
and move on to the kraal which we reach about an hour befor sunset
thi kraal wa a collect of hut surround by a slight thornfenc
perhap there were ten of them in all it wa situat in a kloof of the
mountain down which a rivulet flow the kloof wa dens wood but
for some distanc abov the kraal it wa free from bush and here on the
rich deep ground brought down by the rivulet were the cultiv land
in extent somewher about twenti or twentyf acr on the kraal side
of these land stood a singl hut that serv for a meali store which
at the moment wa us as a dwellingplac by an old woman the first
wife of our friend the head man
it appear that thi ladi have had some differ of opinion with
her husband about the extent of author allow to a younger and more
amiabl wife had refus to dwell in the kraal ani more and by wai
of mark her displeasur had taken up her abod among the meali as
the issu will show she wa it happen cut off her nose to spite
her face
close by thi hut grew a larg baobab tree a glanc at the meali
ground show me that the old head man had not exagger the mischief
done by the eleph to hi crop which were now get ripe nearli
half of the entir patch wa destroi the great brute had eaten all
thei could and the rest thei had trampl down i went up to their
spoor and start back in amazementnev had i seen such a spoor
befor it wa simpli enorm more especi that of on old bull
that carri so said the nativ but a singl tusk on might have
us ani of the footprint for a hipbath
have taken stock of the posit my next step wa to make
arrang for the frai the three bull accord to the nativ
had been spoor into the dens patch of bush abov the kloof now it
seem to me veri probabl that thei would return tonight to feed on
the remaind of the ripen meali if so there wa a bright moon
and it struck me that by the exercis of a littl ingenu i might bag
on or more of them without expos myself to ani risk which have
the highest respect for the aggress power of bull eleph wa a
great consider to me
thi then wa my plan to the right of the hut as you look up the
kloof and command the meali land stand the baobab tree that i
have mention into that baobab tree i made up my mind to go then
if the eleph appear i should get a shot at them i announc my
intent to the head man of the kraal who wa delight now
he said hi peopl might sleep in peac for while the mighti white
hunter sat aloft like a spirit watch over the welfar of hi kraal
what wa there to fear
i told him that he wa an ungrat brute to think of sleep in
peac while perch like a wound vultur on a tree i watch for hi
welfar in wake sorrow and onc more he collaps and own that my
word were sharp but just
howev as i have said confid wa complet restor and that
even everybodi in the kraal includ the superannu victim of
jealousi in the littl hut where the meali cob were store went to
bed with a sens of sweet secur from eleph and all other anim
that prowl by night
for my part i pitch my camp below the kraal and then have
procur a beam of wood from the head manrath a rotten on by the
wayi set it across two bough that ran out later from the baobab
tree at a height of about twentyf feet from the ground in such
fashion that i and anoth man could sit upon it with our leg hang
down and rest our back against the bole of the tree thi done i went
back to the camp and at my supper about nine oclock halfanhour
befor the moonris i summon gobo who think that he had seen
about enough of the delight of big game hunt for that dai did not
altogeth relish the job and despit hi remonstr gave him my
eightbor to carri i have the 570express then we set out for
the tree it wa veri dark but we found it without difficulti though
climb it wa a more complic matter howev at last we got up
and sat down like two littl boi on a form that is too high for
them and wait i did not dare to smoke becaus i rememb the
rhinocero and fear that the eleph might wind the tobacco if thei
should come my wai and thi made the busi more wearisom so i fell
to think and wonder at the complet of the silenc
at last the moon came up and with it a moan wind at the breath of
which the silenc began to whisper mysteri lone enough in the
newborn light look the wide expans of mountain plain and forest
more like some vision of a dream some reflect from a fair world of
peac beyond our ken than the mere face of garish earth made soft with
sleep inde had it not been for the fact that i wa begin to find
the log on which i sat veri hard i should have grown quit sentiment
over the beauti sight but i will defi anybodi to becom sentiment
when seat in the damp on a veri rough beam of wood and halfwai up
a tree so i mere made a mental note that it wa a particularli love
night and turn my attent to the prospect of eleph but no
eleph came and after wait for anoth hour or so i think that
what between weari and disgust i must have drop into a gentl
doze present i awok with a start gobo who wa perch close to me
but as far off as the beam would allowfor neither white man nor black
like the aroma which each vow is the peculiar and disagre properti
of the otherwa faintli veri faintli click hi forefing against
hi thumb i knew by thi signal a veri favourit on among nativ
hunter and gunbear that he must have seen or heard someth i
look at hi face and saw that he wa stare excitedli toward the
dim edg of the bush beyond the deep green line of meali i stare
too and listen present i heard a soft larg sound as though a
giant were gentli stretch out hi hand and press back the ear
of stand corn then came a paus and then out into the open
majest stalk the largest eleph i ever saw or ever shall see
heaven what a monster he wa and how the moonlight gleam upon hi
on splendid tuskfor the other wa missinga he stood among the
meali gentli move hi enorm ear to and fro and test the
wind with hi trunk while i wa still marvel at hi girth and
specul upon the weight of that huge tusk which i swore should be
my tusk befor veri long out step a second bull and stood besid
him he wa not quit so tall but he seem to me to be almost
thickerset than the first and even in that light i could see that both
hi tusk were perfect anoth paus and the third emerg he wa
shorter than either of the other but higher in the shoulder than no
2 and when i tell you as i afterward learnt from actual measur
that the smallest of these mighti bull measur twelv feet on and a
half inch at the shoulder it will give you some idea of their size
the three form into line and stood still for a minut the onetusk
bull gentli caress the eleph on the left with hi trunk
then thei began to feed walk forward and slightli to the right as
thei gather great bunch of the sweet meali and thrust them into
their mouth all thi time thei were more than a hundr and twenti
yard awai from me thi i knew becaus i had pace the distanc from
the tree to variou point much too far to allow of my attempt
a shot at them in that uncertain light thei fed in a semicircl
gradual draw round toward the hut near my tree in which the corn
wa store and the old woman slept
thi went on for between an hour and an hour and a half till what
between excit and hope that maketh the heart sick i grew so
weari that i wa actual contempl a descent from the tree and a
moonlight stalk such an act in ground so open would have been that of a
stark stare lunat and that i should even have been contempl it
will show you the condit of my mind but everyth come to him who
know how to wait and sometim too to him who doesnt and so at last
those eleph or rather on of them came to me
after thei had fed their fill which wa a veri larg on the nobl
three stood onc more in line some seventi yard to the left of the hut
and on the edg of the cultiv land or in all about eightyf
yard from where i wa perch then at last the on with a singl tusk
made a peculiar rattl nois in hi trunk just as though he were
blow hi nose and without more ado began to walk deliber toward
the hut where the old woman slept i made my rifl readi and glanc up
at the moon onli to discov that a new complic wa loom in the
immedi futur i have said that a wind rose with the moon well the
wind brought raincloud along it track sever light on had alreadi
lessen the light for a littl while though without obscur it and
now two more were come up rapidli both of them veri black and dens
the first cloud wa small and long and the on behind big and broad i
rememb notic that the pair of them bore a most comic resembl
to a drai drawn by a veri long rawbon hors as luck would have it
just as the eleph arriv within twentyf yard or so of me the
head of the horsecloud float over the face of the moon render
it imposs for me to fire in the faint twilight which remain
howev i could just make out the grai mass of the great brute still
advanc toward the hut then the light went altogeth and i had to
trust to my ear i heard him fumbl with hi trunk appar at the
roof of the hut next came a sound as of straw be drawn out and then
for a littl while there wa complet silenc
the cloud began to pass i could see the outlin of the eleph he
wa stand with hi head quit over the top of the hut but i could
not see hi trunk and no wonder for it wa insid the hut he had
thrust it through the roof and attract no doubt by the smell of the
meali wa grope about with it insid it wa grow light now and
i got my rifl readi when suddenli there wa a most aw yell and
i saw the trunk reappear and in it mighti fold the old woman who
had been sleep in the hut out she came through the hole like a
periwinkl on the point of a pin still wrap up in her blanket
and with her skinni arm and leg stretch to the four point of the
compass and as she did so gave that most alarm screech i realli
dont know who wa the most frighten she or i or the eleph at
ani rate the last wa consider startl he had been fish
for mealiesth old woman wa a mere accid and on that greatli
discompos hi nerv he gave a sort of trumpet and threw her awai
from him right into the crown of a low mimosa tree where she stuck
shriek like a metropolitan engin the old bull lift hi tail and
flap hi great ear prepar for flight i put up my eightbor and
aim hastili at the point of hi shoulder for he wa broadsid on i
fire the report rang out like thunder make a thousand echo in
the quiet hill i saw him go down all of a heap as though he were stone
dead then ala whether it wa the kick of the heavi rifl or the
excit bump of that idiot gobo or both togeth or mere an unhappi
coincid i do not know but the rotten beam broke and i went down
too land flat at the foot of the tree upon a certain humbl portion
of the human frame the shock wa so sever that i felt as though all
my teeth were fly through the roof of my mouth but although i sat
slightli stun for a few second luckili for me i fell light and wa
not in ani wai injur
meanwhil the eleph began to scream with fear and furi and
attract by hi cri the other two charg up i felt for my rifl
it wa not there then i rememb that i had rest it on a fork of
the bough in order to fire and doubtless there it remain my posit
wa now veri unpleas i did not dare to try and climb the tree again
which shaken as i wa would have been a task of some difficulti
becaus the eleph would certainli see me and gobo who had clung to
a bough wa still aloft with the other rifl i could not run becaus
there wa no shelter near under these circumst i did the onli
thing feasibl clamber round the trunk as softli as possibl and
keep on ey on the eleph whisper to gobo to bring down the
rifl and await the develop of the situat i knew that if
the eleph did not see mewhich luckili thei were too enrag to
dothei would not smell me for i wa upwind gobo howev either
did not or prefer the safeti of the tree would not hear me he
said the former but i believ the latter for i knew that he wa not
enough of a sportsman to realli enjoi shoot eleph by moonlight in
the open so there i wa behind my tree dismai unarm but highli
interest for i wa wit a remark perform
when the two other bull arriv the wound eleph on the ground
ceas to scream but began to make a low moan nois and to gentli
touch the wound near hi shoulder from which the blood wa liter
spout the other two seem to understand at ani rate thei did
thi kneel down on either side thei place their trunk and tusk
underneath him and aid by hi own effort with on great lift got
him on to hi feet then lean against him on either side to support
him thei march off at a walk in the direct of the villag it
wa a piti sight and even then it made me feel a brute
the editor would have been inclin to think that in
relat thi incid mr quatermain wa make himself
interest at the expens of the exact truth did it not
happen that a similar incid ha come within hi
knowledgeeditor
present from a walk as the wound eleph gather himself
togeth a littl thei broke into a trot and after that i could follow
them no longer with my ey for the second black cloud came up over the
moon and put her out as an extinguish put out a dip i sai with my
ey but my ear gave me a veri fair notion of what wa go on when
the cloud came up the three terrifi anim were head directli for
the kraal probabl becaus the wai wa open and the path easi i fanci
that thei grew confus in the dark for when thei came to the kraal
fenc thei did not turn asid but crash straight through it then
there were time as the irish servantgirl sai in the american book
have taken the fenc thei thought that thei might as well take the
kraal also so thei just ran over it on hiveshap hut wa turn
quit over on to it top and when i arriv upon the scene the peopl
who had been sleep there were bumbl about insid like bee
disturb at night while two more were crush flat and a third had
all it side torn out oddli enough howev nobodi wa hurt though
sever peopl had a narrow escap of be trodden to death
on arriv i found the old head man in a state painfulli like that
favour by greek art danc about in front of hi ruin abod as
vigor as though he had just been stung by a scorpion
i ask him what ail him and he burst out into a flood of abus
he call me a wizard a sham a fraud a bringer of bad luck i had
promis to kill the eleph and i had so arrang thing that the
eleph had nearli kill him etc
thi still smart or rather ach as i wa from that most
terrif bump wa too much for my feel so i just made a rush at
my friend and get him by the ear i bang hi head against the
doorwai of hi own hut which wa all that wa left of it
you wick old scoundrel i said you dare to complain about your
own trifl inconveni when you gave me a rotten beam to sit on
and therebi deliv me to the furi of the eleph bump bump
bump when your own wife bump ha just been drag out
of her hut bump like a snail from it shell and thrown by the
earthshak into a tree bump bump
merci my father merci gasp the old fellow truli i have done
amissmi heart tell me so
i should hope it did you old villain bump
merci great white man i thought the log wa sound but what sai the
unequal chiefi the old woman my wife inde dead ah if she is
dead all mai yet prove to have been for the veri best and he clasp
hi hand and look up piousli to heaven in which the moon wa onc
more shine brightli
i let go hi ear and burst out laugh the whole scene and hi devout
aspir for the deceas of the partner of hi joi or rather woe
were so intens ridicul
no you old iniqu i answer i left her in the top of a
thorntre scream like a thousand bluejai the eleph put her
there
ala ala he said sure the back of the ox is shape to the
burden doubtless my father she will come down when she is tire and
without troubl himself further about the matter he began to blow at
the smoulder ember of the fire
and as a matter of fact she did appear a few minut later
consider scratch and startl but none the wors
after that i made my wai to my littl camp which fortun the
eleph had not walk over and wrap myself up in a blanket wa
soon fast asleep
and so end my first round with those three eleph
ivth last round
on the morrow i woke up full of pain recollect and not without
a certain feel of gratitud to the power abov that i wa there
to wake up yesterdai had been a tempestu dai inde what between
buffalo rhinocero and eleph it had been veri tempestu have
realiz thi fact i next bethought me of those magnific tusk and
instantli earli as it wa broke the tenth command i covet my
neighbour tusk if an eleph could be said to be my neighbour de
jure as certainli so recent as the previou night he had been de
factoa much closer neighbour than i care for inde now when you
covet your neighbour good the best thing if not the most moral
thing to do is to enter hi hous as a strong man arm and take them
i wa not a strong man but have recov my eightbor i wa
arm and so wa the other strong manth eleph with the tusk
consequ i prepar for a struggl to the death in other word i
summon my faith retain and told them that i wa now go to
follow those eleph to the edg of the world if necessari thei
show a certain bash about the busi but thei did not
gainsai me becaus thei dare not ever sinc i had prepar with all
due solemn to execut the rebelli gobo thei had conceiv a great
respect for me
so i went up to bid adieu to the old head man whom i found altern
contempl the ruin of hi kraal and with the abl assist of
hi last wife thrash the jealou ladi who had slept in the meali
hut becaus she wa as he declar the fount of all hi sorrow
leav them to work a wai through their domest differ i levi
a suppli of veget food from the kraal in consider of servic
render and left them with my bless i do not know how thei settl
matter becaus i have not seen them sinc
then i start on the spoor of the three bull for a coupl of mile
or so below the kraala far inde as the belt of swamp that border
the riverth ground is at thi spot rather stoni and cloth with
scatter bush rain had fallen toward the daybreak and thi fact
togeth with the natur of the soil made spoor a veri difficult
busi the wound bull had inde bled freeli but the rain had
wash the blood off the leav and grass and the ground be so
rough and hard did not take the footmark so clearli as wa conveni
howev we got along though slowli partli by the spoor and partli
by carefulli lift leav and blade of grass and find blood
underneath them for the blood gush from a wound anim often fall
upon their inner surfac and then of cours unless the rain is veri
heavi it is not wash awai it took us someth over an hour and a
half to reach the edg of the marsh but onc there our task becam
much easier for the soft soil show plenti evid of the great
brute passag thread our wai through the swampi land we came
at last to a ford of the river and here we could see where the poor
wound anim had lain down in the mud and water in the hope of eas
himself of hi pain and could see also how hi two faith companion
had assist him to rise again we cross the ford and took up the
spoor on the further side and follow it into the marshlik
land beyond no rain had fallen on thi side of the river and the
bloodmark were consequ much more frequent
all that dai we follow the three bull now across open plain and
now through patch of bush thei seem to have travel on almost
without stop and i notic that as thei went the wound bull
recov hi strength a littl thi i could see from hi spoor which
had becom firmer and also from the fact that the other two had ceas
to support him at last even close in and have travel some
eighteen mile we camp thoroughli tire out
befor dawn on the follow dai we were up and the first break of
light found us onc more on the spoor about halfpast five oclock
we reach the place where the eleph had fed and slept the
two unwound bull had taken their fill as the condit of the
neighbour bush show but the wound on had eaten noth he
had spent the night lean against a goodsiz tree which hi weight
had push out of the perpendicular thei had not long left thi place
and could not be veri far ahead especi as the wound bull wa now
again so stiff after hi night rest that for the first few mile the
other two had been oblig to support him but eleph go veri quick
even when thei seem to be travel slowli for shrub and creeper that
almost stop a man progress ar no hindranc to them the three had
now turn to the left and were travel back again in a semicircular
line toward the mountain probabl with the idea of work round to
their old feed ground on the further side of the river
there wa noth for it but to follow their lead and accordingli
we follow with industri through all that long hot dai did we tramp
pass quantiti of everi sort of game and even come across the
spoor of other eleph but in spite of my men entreati i would
not turn asid after these i would have those mighti tusk or none
by even we were quit close to our game probabl within a quarter
of a mile but the bush wa dens and we could see noth of them so
onc more we must camp thoroughli disgust with our luck that night
just after the moon rose while i wa sit smoke my pipe with my
back against a tree i heard an eleph trumpet as though someth
had startl it and not three hundr yard awai i wa veri tire but
my curios overcam my weari so without sai a word to ani of
the men all of whom were asleep i took my eightbor and a few spare
cartridg and steer toward the sound the game path which we had
been follow all dai ran straight on in the direct from which the
eleph had trumpet it wa narrow but well trodden and the
light struck down upon it in a straight white line i crept along it
cautious for some two hundr yard when it open suddenli into a
most beauti glade some hundr yard or more in width wherein tall
grass grew and flattop tree stood singli with the caution born of
long experi i watch for a few moment befor i enter the glade
and then i saw why the eleph had trumpet there in the middl of
the glade stood a larg mane lion he stood quit still make a soft
pur nois and wave hi tail to and fro present the grass about
forti yard on the hither side of him gave a wide rippl and a lioness
sprang out of it like a flash and bound noiselessli up to the lion
reach him the great cat halt suddenli and rub her head against
hi shoulder then thei both began to purr loudli so loudli that i
believ that in the still on might have heard them two hundr
yard or more awai
after a time while i wa still hesit what to do either thei got
a whiff of my wind or thei weari of stand still and determin
to start in search of game at ani rate as though move by a common
impuls thei bound suddenli awai leap by leap and vanish in the
depth of the forest to the left i wait for a littl while longer to
see if there were ani more yellow skin about and see none came to
the conclus that the lion must have frighten the eleph awai
and that i had taken my stroll for noth but just as i wa turn
back i thought that i heard a bough break upon the further side of the
glade and rash as the act wa i follow the sound i cross the
glade as silent as my own shadow on it further side the path went
on albeit with mani fear i went on too the jungl growth wa so
thick here that it almost met overhead leav so small a passag for
the light that i could scarc see to grope my wai along present
howev it widen and then open into a second glade slightli
smaller than the first and there on the further side of it about
eighti yard from me stood the three enorm eleph
thei stood thusimmedi opposit and face me wa the wound
onetusk bull he wa lean hi bulk against a dead thorntre the
onli on in the place and look veri sick inde near him stood the
second bull as though keep a watch over him the third eleph wa
a good deal nearer to me and broadsid on while i wa still stare at
them thi eleph suddenli walk off and vanish down a path in the
bush to the right
there ar now two thing to be doneeith i could go back to the camp
and advanc upon the eleph at dawn or i could attack them at onc
the first wa of cours by far the wiser and safer cours to engag
on eleph by moonlight and singlehand is a suffici rash
proceed to tackl three wa littl short of lunaci but on
the other hand i knew that thei would be on the march again befor
daylight and there might come anoth dai of weari trudg befor i
could catch them up or thei might escap me altogeth
no i thought to myself faint heart never won fair tusk ill risk
it and have a slap at them but how i could not advanc across the
open for thei would see me clearli the onli thing to do wa to creep
round in the shadow of the bush and try to come upon them so so i
start seven or eight minut of care stalk brought me to the
mouth of the path down which the third eleph had walk the other
two were now about fifti yard from me and the natur of the wall of
bush wa such that i could not see how to get nearer to them without
be discov i hesit and peep down the path which the
eleph had follow about five yard in it took a turn round a
shrub i thought that i would just have a look behind it and advanc
expect that i should be abl to catch a sight of the eleph tail
as it happen howev i met hi trunk come round the corner it is
veri disconcert to see an eleph trunk when you expect to see hi
tail and for a moment i stood paralyz almost under the vast brute
head for he wa not five yard from me he too halt threw up hi
trunk and trumpet preparatori to a charg i wa in for it now for
i could not escap either to the right or left on account of the bush
and i did not dare turn my back so i did the onli thing that i could
dorais the rifl and fire at the black mass of hi chest it wa
too dark for me to pick a shot i could onli brown him as it were
the shot rung out like thunder on the quiet air and the eleph
answer it with a scream then drop hi trunk and stood for a second
or two as still as though he had been cut in stone i confess that i
lost my head i ought to have fire my second barrel but i did not
instead of do so i rapidli open my rifl pull out the old
cartridg from the right barrel and replac it but befor i could snap
the breech to the bull wa at me i saw hi great trunk fly up like a
brown beam and i wait no longer turn i fled for dear life and
after me thunder the eleph right into the open glade i ran and
then thank heaven just as he wa come up with me the bullet took
effect on him he had been shot right through the heart or lung and
down he fell with a crash stone dead
but in escap from scylla i had run into the jaw of charybdi i
heard the eleph fall and glanc round straight in front of me
and not fifteen pace awai were the other two bull thei were stare
about and at that moment thei caught sight of me then thei came the
pair of themcam like thunderbolt and from differ angl i had
onli time to snap my rifl to lift it and fire almost at haphazard
at the head of the nearest the unwound bull
now as you know in the case of the african eleph whose skull is
convex and not concav like that of the indian thi is alwai a most
riski and veri frequent a perfectli useless shot the bullet lose
itself in the mass of bone that is all but there is on littl vital
place and should the bullet happen to strike there it will follow
the channel of the nostrilsat least i suppos it is that of the
nostrilsand reach the brain and thi wa what happen in the present
caseth ball struck the fatal spot in the region of the ey and
travel to the brain down came the great bull all of a heap and
roll on to hi side as dead as a stone i swung round at that instant
to face the third the monster bull with on tusk that i had wound
two dai befor he wa alreadi almost over me and in the dim moonlight
seem to tower abov me like a hous i lift the rifl and pull
at hi neck it would not go off then in a flash as it were i
rememb that it wa on the halfcock the lock of thi barrel wa a
littl weak and a few dai befor in fire at a cow eland the
left barrel had jar off at the shock of the discharg of the right
knock me backward with the recoil so after that i had kept it on
the halfcock till i actual want to fire it
i gave on desper bound to the right and my lame leg
notwithstand i believ that few men could have made a better jump
at ani rate it wa none too soon for as i jump i felt the wind made
by the tremend downward stroke of the monster trunk then i ran for
it
i ran like a buck still keep hold of my gun howev my idea
so far as i could be said to have ani fix idea wa to bolt down the
pathwai up which i had come like a rabbit down a burrow trust that
he would lose sight of me in the uncertain light i sped across the
glade fortun the bull be wound could not go full speed
but wound or no he could go quit as fast as i could i wa unabl to
gain an inch and awai we went with just about three feet between our
separ extrem we were at the other side now and a glanc serv
to show me that i had miscalcul and overshot the open to reach
it now wa hopeless i should have blunder straight into the eleph
so i did the onli thing i could do i swerv like a cours hare and
start off round the edg of the glade seek for some open into
which i could plung thi gave me a moment start for the bull
could not turn as quickli as i could and i made the most of it but no
open could i see the bush wa like a wall we were speed round
the edg of the glade and the eleph wa come up again now he wa
within about six feet and now as he trumpet or rather scream
i could feel the fierc hot blast of hi breath strike upon my head
heaven how it frighten me
we were three part round the glade now and about fifti yard ahead
wa the singl larg dead thorntre against which the bull had been
lean i spurt for it it wa my last chanc of safeti but spurt as
i would it seem hour befor i got there put out my right hand
i swung round the tree thu bring myself face to face with the
eleph i had not time to lift the rifl to fire i had bare time to
cock it and run sidewai and backward when he wa on to me crash he
came strike the tree full with hi forehead it snap like a carrot
about forti inch from the ground fortun i wa clear of the
trunk but on of the dead branch struck me on the chest as it went
down and swept me to the ground i fell upon my back and the eleph
blunder past me as i lai more by instinct than anyth els i lift
the rifl with on hand and pull the trigger it explod and as i
discov afterward the bullet struck him in the rib but the recoil
of the heavi rifl held thu wa veri sever it bent my arm up and
sent the butt with a thud against the top of my shoulder and the side of
my neck for the moment quit paralyz me and caus the weapon to
jump from my grasp meanwhil the bull wa rush on he travel for
some twenti pace and then suddenli he stop faintli i reflect
that he wa come back to finish me but even the prospect of immin
and dread death could not rous me into action i wa utterli spent
i could not move
idli almost indiffer i watch hi movement for a moment
he stood still next he trumpet till the welkin rang and then veri
slowli and with great digniti he knelt down at thi point i swoon
awai
when i came to myself again i saw from the moon that i must have been
insens for quit two hour i wa drench with dew and shiver
all over at first i could not think where i wa when on lift
my head i saw the outlin of the onetusk bull still kneel some
fiveandtwenti pace from me then i rememb slowli i rais
myself and wa instantli taken with a violent sick the result
of overexert after which i veri nearli faint a second time
present i grew better and consid the posit two of the
eleph were as i knew dead but how about no 3 there he knelt in
majesti in the lone moonlight the question wa wa he rest or
dead i rose on my hand and knee load my rifl and painfulli crept
a few pace nearer i could see hi ey now for the moonlight fell full
upon itit wa open and rather promin i crouch and watch the
eyelid did not move nor did the great brown bodi or the trunk or the
ear or the tailnoth move then i knew that he must be dead
i crept up to him still keep the rifl well forward and gave him a
thump reflect as i did so how veri near i had been to be thump
instead of thump he never stir certainli he wa dead though to
thi dai i do not know if it wa my random shot that kill him or
if he di from concuss of the brain consequ upon the tremend
shock of hi contact with the tree anyhow there he wa cold and
beauti he lai or rather knelt as the poet nearli put it inde i
do not think that i have ever seen a sight more impos in it wai than
that of the mighti beast crouch in majest death and shone upon by
the lone moon
while i stood admir the scene and heartili congratul myself
upon my escap onc more i began to feel sick accordingli without
wait to examin the other two bull i stagger back to the camp
which in due cours i reach in safeti everybodi in it wa asleep i
did not wake them but have swallow a mouth of brandi i threw
off my coat and shoe roll myself up in a blanket and wa soon fast
asleep
when i woke it wa alreadi light and at first i thought that like
joseph i had dream a dream at that moment howev i turn my
head and quickli knew that it wa no dream for my neck and face were
so stiff from the blow of the buttend of the rifl that it wa agoni
to move them i collaps for a minut or two gobo and anoth man
wrap up like a coupl of monk in their blanket think that i wa
still asleep were crouch over a littl fire thei had made for the
morn wa damp and chilli and hold sweet convers
gobo said that he wa get tire of run after eleph which
thei never caught macumazahn that is myself wa without doubt a man
of part and of some skill in shoot but also he wa a fool none
but a fool would run so fast and far after eleph which it wa
imposs to catch when thei kept cut the spoor of fresh on
he certainli wa a fool but he must not be allow to continu in
hi folli and he gobo had determin to put a stop to it he should
refus to accompani him ani further on so mad a hunt
ye the other answer the poor man certainli wa sick in hi
head and it wa quit time that thei check hi folli while thei still
had a patch of skin left upon their feet moreov he for hi part
certainli did not like thi countri of wamb which realli wa full of
ghost onli the last night he had heard the spook at workthei were
out shoot at least it sound as though thei were it wa veri
queer but perhap their lunat of a master
gobo you scoundrel i shout out at thi junctur sit bolt
upright on the blanket stop idl there and make me some coffe
up sprang gobo and hi friend and in half a moment were respectfulli
skip about in a manner that contrast well with the lordli contempt
of their previou convers but all the time thei were in earnest in
what thei said about hunt the eleph ani further for befor i had
finish my coffe thei came to me in a bodi and said that if i want
to follow those eleph i must follow them myself for thei would not
go
i argu with them and affect to be much put out the eleph were
close at hand i said i wa sure of it i had heard them trumpet in the
night
ye answer the men mysteri thei too had heard thing in the
night thing not nice to hear thei had heard the spook out shoot
and no longer would thei remain in a countri so vile haunt
it wa nonsens i repli if ghost went out shoot sure
thei would us airgun and not black powder and on would not hear
an airgun well if thei were coward and would not come of cours
i could not forc them to but i would make a bargain with them thei
should follow those eleph for on halfhour more then if we fail
to come upon them i would abandon the pursuit and we would go straight
to wamb chief of the matuku and give him hongo
to thi compromis the men agre readili accordingli about
halfanhour later we struck our camp and start and notwithstand
my ach and bruis i do not think that i ever felt in better spirit
in my life it is someth to wake up in the morn and rememb that
in the dead of the night singlehand on ha given battl to and
overthrown three of the largest eleph in africa slai them with
three bullet such a feat to my knowledg had never been done befor
and on that particular morn i felt a veri tall man of my hand
inde the onli thing i fear wa that should i ever come to tell
the stori nobodi would believ it for when a strang tale is told by
a hunter peopl ar apt to think it is necessarili a lie instead of
be onli probabl so
for the satisfact of ani who mai be so disbeliev
as to take thi view of mr quatermain stori the editor
mai state that a gentleman with whom he is acquaint and
whose verac he believ to be beyond doubt not long ago
describ to him how he chanc to kill four african
eleph with four consecut bullet two of these
eleph were charg him simultan and out of the
four three were kill with the head shot a veri uncommon
thing in the case of the african elephanteditor
well we pass on till have cross the first glade where i had
seen the lion we reach the neck of bush that separ it from the
second glade where the dead eleph were and here i began to take
elabor precaut amongst other order gobo to keep some yard
ahead and look out sharp as i thought that the eleph might be
about he obei my instruct with a superior smile and push
ahead present i saw him pull up as though he had been shot and begin
to snap hi finger faintli
what is it i whisper
the eleph the great eleph with on tusk kneel down
i crept up besid him there knelt the bull as i had left him last
night and there too lai the other bull
do these eleph sleep i whisper to the astonish gobo
ye macumazahn thei sleep
nai gobo thei ar dead
dead how can thei be dead who kill them
what do peopl call me gobo
thei call you macumazahn
and what doe macumazahn mean
it mean the man who keep hi ey open the man who get up in the
night
ye gobo and i am that man look you idl lazi coward while you
slept last night i rose and alon i hunt those great eleph and
slew them by the moonlight to each of them i gave on bullet and onli
on and it fell dead look and i advanc into the glade here is
my spoor and here is the spoor of the great bull charg after me and
there is the tree that i took refug behind see the eleph shatter
it in hi charg oh you coward you who would give up the chase
while the blood spoor steam beneath your nostril see what i did
singlehand while you slept and be asham
ou said the men ou koo koo y umcool chief great
chief and then thei held their tongu and go up to the three dead
beast gaze upon them in silenc
but after that those men look upon me with aw as be almost
more than mortal no mere man thei said could have slain those three
eleph alon in the nighttim i never had ani further troubl with
them i believ that if i had told them to jump over a precipic and
that thei would take no harm thei would have believ me
well i went up and examin the bull such tusk as thei had i never
saw and never shall see again it took us all dai to cut them out and
when thei reach delagoa bai as thei did ultim though not in my
keep the singl tusk of the big bull scale on hundr and sixti
pound and the four other tusk averag ninetynin and a half
poundsa most wonder inde an almost unpreced lot of
ivori unfortun i wa forc to saw the big tusk in two
otherwis we could not have carri it
the largest eleph tusk of which the editor ha ani
certain knowledg scale on hundr and fifti pound
oh quatermain you barbarian i broke in here the idea of spoil
such a tusk why i would have kept it whole if i had been oblig to
drag it myself
oh ye young man he answer it is all veri well for you to talk
like that but if you had found yourself in the posit which it wa
my privileg to occupi a few hour afterward it is my belief that you
would have thrown the tusk awai altogeth and taken to your heel
oh said good so that isnt the end of the yarn a veri good yarn
quatermain by the wayi couldnt have made up a better on myself
the old gentleman look at good sever for it irrit him to be
chaf about hi stori
i dont know what you mean good i dont see that there is ani
comparison between a true stori of adventur and the preposter tale
which you invent about ibex hang by their horn no it is not the
end of the stori the most excit part is to come but i have talk
enough for tonight and if you go on in that wai good it will be some
time befor i begin again
sorri i spoke im sure said good humbl let have a split to
show that there is no illfeel and thei did
vthe messag of maiwa
on the follow even we onc more dine togeth and quatermain
after some pressur wa persuad to continu hi storyfor good
remark still rankl in hi breast
at last he went on a few minut befor sunset the task wa
finish we had labour at it all dai stop onli onc for dinner
for it is no easi matter to hew out five such tusk as those which
now lai befor me in a white and gleam line it wa a dinner worth
eat too i can tell you for we dine off the heart of the great
onetusk bull which wa so big that the man whom i sent insid the
eleph to look for hi heart wa forc to remov it in two piec
we cut it into slice and fri it with fat and i never tast heart
to equal it for the meat seem to melt in on mouth by the wai i
examin the jaw of the eleph it never grew but on tusk the other
had not been broken off nor wa it present in a rudimentari form
well there lai the five beauti or rather four of them for gobo and
anoth man were engag in saw the grand on in two at last
with mani sigh i order them to do thi but not until by practic
experi i had prove that it wa imposs to carri it in ani other
wai on hundr and sixti pound of solid ivori or rather more in it
green state is too great a weight for two men to bear for long across
a broken countri i sat watch the job and smoke the pipe of
content when suddenli the bush open and a veri handsom and
dignifi nativ girl appar about twenti year of ag stood
befor me carri a basket of green meali upon her head
although i wa rather surpris to see a nativ girl in such a wild
spot and so far as i knew a long wai from ani kraal the matter did
not attract my particular notic i mere call to on of the men and
told him to bargain with the woman for the meali and ask her if there
were ani more to be bought in the neighbourhood then i turn my head
and continu to superintend the cut of the tusk present a shadow
fell upon me i look up and saw that the girl wa stand befor me
the basket of meali still on her head
marm marm she said gentli clap her hand togeth the
word marm among these matuku though she wa no matuku answer to
the zulu koo and the clap of hand is a form of salut veri
common among the tribe of the basutu race
what is it girl i ask her in sisutu ar those meali for
sale
no great white hunter she answer in zulu i bring them as a
gift

world what do you wantbead
she nod and i wa about to tell on of the men to go and fetch some
from on of the pack when she check me
a gift from the giver own hand is twice a gift she said and i
thought that she spoke meaningli

sure
i rose to go with her how is it that be of the matuku you speak
in the zulu tongu i ask suspici
i am not of the matuku she answer as soon as we were out of
hear of the men i am of the peopl of nala whose tribe is the
butiana tribe and who live there and she point over the mountain
also i am on of the wive of wamb and her ey flash as she said

and how did you come here
on my feet she answer lacon
we reach the pack and undo on of them i extract a hand of
bead now i said a gift for a gift hand over the meali
she took the bead without even look at them which struck me as
curiou and set the basket of meali on the ground empti it
at the bottom of the basket were some curiouslyshap green leav
rather like the leav of the guttapercha tree in shape onli somewhat
thicker and of a more fleshi substanc as though by hazard the girl
pick on of these leav out of the basket and smelt it then she
hand it to me i took the leaf and suppos that she wish me to
smell it also wa about to oblig her by do so when my ey fell
upon some curiou red scratch on the green surfac of the leaf
ah said the girl whose name by the wai wa maiwa speak
beneath her breath read the sign white man
without answer her i continu to stare at the leaf it had been
scratch or rather written upon with a sharp tool such as a nail and
wherev thi instrument had touch it the acid juic ooz through
the outer skin had turn a rusti blood colour present i found the
begin of the scrawl and read thi in english and cover the
surfac of the leaf and of two other that were in the basket

no old boi thought i to myself it isnt like that i am go
to leav you there while there is a chanc of get you out i have
plai fox befor nowther still a doubl or two left in me i must
make a plan that all and then there that stockad of tusk i am

order him to get the men readi for instant departur the woman who
as i have said wa quit young and veri handsom put her hand into
a littl pouch made of antelop hide which she wore fasten round the
waist and to my horror drew from it the wither hand of a child which
evid had been carefulli dri in the smoke
i fly for thi caus she answer hold the poor littl hand
toward me see now i bore a child wamb wa it father and for
eighteen month the child live and i love it but wamb love not hi

salut him call him the chief who soon shall be wamb heard
and wa mad he smote the babe and it wept then he said that it should
weep for good caus among the thing that he had stolen from the white
men whom he slew is a trap that will hold lion so strong is the trap
that four men must stand on it two on either side befor it can be
open
here old quatermain broke off suddenli
look here you fellow he said i cant bear to go on with thi part
of the stori becaus i never could stand either see or talk of
the suffer of children you can guess what that devil did and what
the poor mother wa forc to wit would you believ it she told
me the tale without a tremor in the most matteroffact wai onli i
notic that her eyelid quiver all the time
well i said as unconcernedli as though i had been talk of the
death of a lamb though inwardli i wa sick with horror and boil
with rage and what do you mean to do about the matter maiwa wife of
wamb
i mean to do thi white man she answer draw herself up to her
full height and speak in tone as hard as steel and cold as icei
mean to work and work and work to bring thi to pass and to bring
that to pass until at length it come to pass that with these live
ey i behold wamb dy the death that he gave to hi child and my
child
well said i answer
ay well said macumazahn well said and not easili forgotten who
could forget oh who could forget see where thi dead hand rest
against my side so onc it rest when aliv and now though it is
dead now everi night it creep from it nest and stroke my hair and
clasp my finger in it tini palm everi night it doe thi fear
lest i should forget oh my child my child ten dai ago i held thee
to my breast and now thi alon remain of thee and she kiss the
dead hand and shiver but never a tear did she weep
see now she went on the white man the prison at wamb kraal
he wa kind to me he love the child that is dead ye he wept
when it father slew it and at the risk of hi life told wamb my
husbandah ye my husbandthat which he is he too it wa who made
a plan he said to me go maiwa after the custom of thy peopl go
purifi thyself in the bush alon have touch a dead on sai to
wamb thou goest to purifi thyself alon for fifteen dai accord to
the custom of thy peopl then fly to thy father nala and stir him up
to war against wamb for the sake of the child that is dead thi then
he said and hi word seem good to me and that same night er i left
to purifi myself came new that a white man hunt in the countri and
wamb be mad with drink grew veri wrath and gave order that an
impi should be gather to slai the white man and hi peopl and seiz
hi good then did the smiter of iron everi write the messag on
the green leav and bid me seek thee out and show forth the matter
that thou mightest save thyself by flight and behold thi thing have i
done macumazahn the hunter the slayer of eleph
ah i said i thank you and how mani men be there in the impi of
wamb
a hundr of men and half a hundr
and where is the impi
there to the north it follow on thy spoor i saw it pass yesterdai
but myself i guess that thou wouldst be nigher to the mountain and
came thi wai and found thee tomorrow at the daybreak the slayer
will be here
veri possibl i thought to myself but thei wont find macumazahn
i have half a mind to put some strychnin into the carcas of those
eleph for their especi benefit though i knew that thei would
stop to eat the eleph as inde thei did to our great gain but
i abandon the idea of poison them becaus i wa rather short of
strychnin
or becaus you did not like to plai the trick quatermain i suggest
with a laugh
i said becaus i had not enough strychnin it would take a great deal
of strychnin to poison three eleph effectu answer the old
gentleman testili
i said noth further but i smile know that old allan could never
have resort to such an artific howev sever hi strait but that
wa hi wai he alwai made himself out to be a most unmerci person
well he went on at that moment gobo came up and announc that we
were readi to march i am glad that you ar readi i said becaus
if you dont march and march quick you will never march again that is
all wamb ha an impi out to kill us and it will be here present
gobo turn posit green and hi knee knock togeth ah what
did i sai he exclaim fate walk about loos in wamb countri
veri good now all you have to do is to walk a littl quicker than
he doe no no you dont leav those eleph tusk behindi am not
go to part with them i can tell you
gobo said no more but hastili direct the men to take up their load
and then ask which wai we were to run
ah i said to maiwa which wai
there she answer point toward the great mountain spur
which tower up into the sky some forti mile awai separ the
territori of nala and wambether below that small peak is on
place where men mai pass and on onli also it can easili be block
from abov if men pass not there then thei must go round the great
peak of the mountain two dai journei and half a dai
and how far is the peak from us
all tonight shall you walk and all tomorrow and if you walk fast
at sunset you shall stand on the peak
i whistl for that meant a fiveandforti mile trudg without sleep
then i call to the men to take each of them as much cook eleph
meat as he could carri conveni i did the same myself and forc
the woman maiwa to eat some as we went thi i did with difficulti for
at that time she seem neither to sleep nor eat nor rest so fierc
wa she set on vengeanc
then we start maiwa guid us after go for a halfhour over
gradual rise ground we found ourselv on the further edg of a
great bushclad depress someth like the bottom of a lake thi
depress through which we had been travel wa cover with bush
to a veri great extent inde almost altogeth so except where it wa
pit with glade such as that wherein i had shot the eleph
at the top of thi slope maiwa halt and put her hand over her
ey look back present she touch me on the arm and point across
the sea of forest toward a compar vacant space of countri some
six or seven mile awai i look and suddenli i saw someth flash in
the red rai of the set sun a paus and then anoth quick flash
what is it i ask
it is the spear of wamb impi and thei travel fast she answer
coolli
i suppos that my face show how littl i like the new for she went
on
fear not thei will stai to feast upon the eleph and while thei
feast we shall journei we mai yet escap
after that we turn and push on again till at length it grew so
dark that we had to wait for the rise of the moon which lost us
time though it gave us rest fortun none of the men had seen that
omin flash of the spear if thei had i doubt if even i could
have kept control of them as it wa thei travel faster than i had
ever known load nativ to go befor so thoroughpac wa their
desir to see the last of wamb countri i howev took the
precaut to march last of all fear lest thei should throw awai
their load to lighten themselv or wors still the tusk for these
kind of fellow would be capabl of throw anyth awai if their own
skin were at stake if the piou nea whose stori you were read
to me the other night had been a mongrel delagoa bai nativ anchis
would have had a poor chanc of get out of troi that is if he wa
known to have made a satisfactori will
at moonris we set out again and with short occasion halt travel
till dawn when we were forc to rest and eat start onc more
about halfpast five we cross the river at noon then began the long
toilsom ascent through thick bush the same in which i shot the bull
buffalo onli some twenti mile to the west of that spot and not more
than twentyf mile on the hither side of wamb kraal there were
six or seven mile of thi dens bush and hard work it wa to get
through it next came a belt of scatter forest which wa easier to
pass though in reveng the ground wa steeper thi wa about two
mile wide and we pass it by about four in the afternoon abov thi
scatter bush lai a long steep slope of boulderstrewn ground which
ran up to the foot of the littl peak some three mile awai as we
emerg footsor and weari on to thi inhospit plain some of the
men look round caught sight of the spear of wamb impi advanc
rapidli not more than a mile behind us
at first there wa a panic and the bearer tri to throw off their
load and run but i harangu them call out to them that certainli
i would shoot the first man who did so and that if thei would but trust
in me i would bring them through the mess now ever sinc i had kill
those three eleph singlehand i had gain great influenc over
these men and thei listen to me so off we went as hard as ever we
could goth member of the alpin club would not have been in it with
us we made the boulder burn as a frenchman would sai
when we had done about a mile the spear began to emerg from the belt
of scatter bush and the whoop of their bearer as thei view us
broke upon our ear quick as our pace had been befor it grew much
quicker now for terror lent wing to my gallant crew but thei were
sore tire and the load were heavi so that run or rather climb as
we would wamb soldier a scrubbylook lot of men arm with
big spear and small shield but without plume climb consider
faster the last mile of that pleas chase wa like a fox hunt
we be the fox and alwai in view what astonish me wa the
extraordinari endur and activ shown by maiwa she never even
flag i think that girl muscl must have been made of iron or
perhap it wa the strength of her will that support her at ani rate
she reach the foot of the peak second poor gobo who wa an excel
hand at run awai be first
present i came up pant and glanc at the ascent befor us wa a
wall of rock about on hundr and fifti feet in height upon which
the strata were laid so as to form a seri of project suffici
resembl step to make the ascent easi compar speak except
at on spot where it wa necessari to climb over a project angl
of cliff and bear a littl to the left it wa not a realli difficult
place but what made it awkward wa that immedi beneath thi
project gape a deep fissur or donga on the brink of which we now
stood origin dug out no doubt by the rush of water from the
peak and cliff thi gulf beneath would be try to the nerv of
a weakhead climber at the critic point and so it prove in the
result the project angl onc pass the remaind of the ascent
wa veri simpl at the summit howev the brow of the cliff hung over
and wa pierc by a singl narrow path cut through it by water in such
fashion that a singl boulder roll into it at the top would make the
cliff quit impass to men without rope
at thi moment wamb soldier were about a thousand yard from us so
it wa evid that we had no time to lose i at onc order the men
to commenc the ascent the girl maiwa who wa familiar with the pass
go first to show them the wai accordingli thei began to mount with
alacr push and lift their load in front of them when the
first of them led by maiwa reach the project angl thei put
down their load upon a ledg of rock and clamber over onc there by
ly on their stomach upon a boulder thei could reach the load which
were held to them by the men beneath and in thi wai drag them over the
awkward place whenc thei were carri easili to the top
but all of thi took time and meanwhil the soldier were come up
fast scream and brandish their big spear thei were now within
about four hundr yard and sever load togeth with all the
tusk had yet to be got over the rock i wa still stand at the
bottom of the cliff shout direct to the men abov but it
occur to me that it would soon be time to move befor do so
howev i thought that it might be well to try and produc a moral
effect upon the advanc enemi in my hand i held a winchest
repeat carbin but the distanc wa too great for me to us it with
effect so i turn to gobo who wa shiver with terror at my side
and hand him the carbin took my express from him
the enemi wa now about three hundr and fifti yard awai and the
express wa onli sight to three hundr still i knew that it could be
trust for the extra fifti yard run in front of wamb soldier
were two mencaptain i supposeon of them veri tall i put up the
three hundr yard flap and sit down with my back against the rock
i drew a long breath to steadi myself and cover the tall man give
him a full sight feel that i wa on him i pull and befor the
sound of the strike bullet could reach my ear i saw the man throw up
hi arm and pitch forward on to hi head hi companion stop dead
give me a fair chanc i rapidli cover him and fire the left
barrel he turn round onc and then sank down in a heap thi caus
the enemi to hesitatethei had never seen men kill at such a
distanc befor and thought that there wa someth uncanni about the
perform take advantag of the lull i gave the express back to
gobo and sling the winchest repeat over my back i began to climb
the cliff
when we reach the project angl all the load were over but
the tusk still had to be pass up and ow to their weight and the
smooth of their surfac thi wa a veri difficult task of cours
i ought to have abandon the tusk often and often have i sinc
reproach myself for not do so inde i think that my obstinaci
about them wa downright sin but i wa alwai obstin about such
thing and i could not bear the idea of leav those splendid tusk
which had cost me so much pain and danger to come by well it nearli
cost me my life also and did cost poor gobo hi as will be seen
shortli to sai noth of the loss inflict by my rifl on the enemi
when i reach the project i found that the men with their usual
stupid were try to hand up the tusk point first now the result
of thi wa that those abov had noth to grip except the round
polish surfac of the ivori and in the posit in which thei were
thi did not give them suffici hold to enabl them to lift the
weight i told them to revers the tusk and push them up so that the
rough and hollow end came to the hand of the men abov thi thei did
and the first two were drag up in safeti
at thi point look behind me i saw the matuku stream up the
slope in a rough extend order and not more than a hundr yard awai
cock the winchest i turn and open fire on them i dont quit
know how mani i miss but i do know that i never shot better in my
life i had to keep shift myself from on enemi to the other fire
almost without get a sight that is by the ey alon after the
fashion of the expert who break glass ball but quick as the work wa
men fell thick and by the time that i had empti the carbin of it
twelv cartridg for the moment the advanc wa check i rapidli
push in some more cartridg and hardli had i done so when the enemi
see that we were about to escap them altogeth came on onc more
with a tremend yell by thi time the two halv of the singl tusk
of the great bull alon remain to be pass up i fire and fire as
effect as befor but notwithstand all that i could do some men
escap my hail of bullet and began to ascend the cliff present
my rifl wa again empti i slung it over my back and draw my
revolv turn to run for it the attack be now quit close as
i did so a spear struck the cliff close to my head
the last half of the tusk wa now vanish over the rock and i sung
out to gobo and the other man who had been push it up to vanish after
it gobo poor fellow requir no second invit inde hi hast
wa hi undo he went at the project rock with a bound the end
of the tusk wa still hang over and instead of grasp the rock he
caught at it it twist in hi handh slippedh fell with on wild
shriek he vanish into the abyss beneath hi fall bodi brush me
as it pass for a moment we stood aghast and present the dull thud
of hi fall smote heavili upon our ear poor fellow he had met the
fate which as he declar walk about loos in wamb countri then
with an oath the remain man sprung at the rock and clamber over it
in safeti aghast at the aw of what had happen i stood still
till i saw the great blade of a matuku spear pass up between my feet
that brought me to my sens and i began to clamber up the rock like
a cat i wa half wai round it alreadi i had clasp the hand of that
brave girl maiwa who came down to help me the men have scrambl
forward with the ivori when i felt some on seiz my ankl
pull maiwa pull i gasp and she certainli did pull maiwa wa a
veri muscular woman and never befor did i appreci the advantag
of the physic develop of femal so keenli she tug at my left
arm the savag below tug at my right leg till i began to realiz
that someth must give wai er long luckili i retain my presenc
of mind like the man who threw hi motherinlaw out of the window and
carri the mattress downstair when a fire broke out in hi hous
my right hand wa still free and in it i held my revolv which wa
secur to my wrist by a leather thong the pistol wa cock and i
simpli point it downward and fire the result wa instantaneousand
so far as i am concern most satisfactori the bullet hit the man
beneath me somewher i am sure i dont know where at ani rate he let
go of my leg and plung headlong into the gulf beneath to join gobo in
anoth moment i wa on the top of the rock and go up the remain
step like a lamplight a singl other soldier appear in pursuit
but on of my boi at the top fire my eleph gun at him i dont know
if he hit him or onli frighten him at ani rate he vanish whenc he
came i do know howev that he veri nearli hit me for i felt the
wind of the bullet
anoth thirti second and i and the woman maiwa were at the top of
the cliff pant but safe
my men be direct thereto by maiwa had most fortun roll
up some big boulder which lai about and with these we soon manag to
block the passag through the overhang ridg of rock in such fashion
that the soldier below could not possibl climb over it inde so far
as i could see thei did not even try to do sotheir heart wa turn
to fat as the zulu sai
then have rest a few moment we took up the load includ the
tusk of ivori that had cost us so dear and in silenc march on for
a coupl of mile or more till we reach a patch of dens bush and
here be utterli exhaust we camp for the night take the
precaut howev of set a guard to watch against ani attempt at
surpris
vith plan of campaign
notwithstand all that we had gone through perhap inde on account
of it for i wa thoroughli worn out i slept that night as soundli as
poor gobo round whose crush bodi the hyna would now be prowl
rise refresh at dawn we went on our wai toward nala kraal which
we reach at nightfal it is built on open ground after the zulu
fashion in a ring fenc and with beehiv hut the cattl kraal is
behind and a littl to the left inde both from their habit and
their talk it wa easi to see that these butiana belong to that section
of the bantu peopl which sinc tchaka time ha been known as the
zulu race we did not see the chief nala that night hi daughter maiwa
went on to hi privat hut as soon as we arriv and veri shortli
afterward on of hi head men came to us bring a sheep and some
meali and milk with him the chief sent us greet he said and
would see us on the morrow meanwhil he wa order to bring us to a
place of rest where we and our good should be safe and undisturb
accordingli he led the wai to some veri good hut just outsid nala
privat enclosur and here we slept comfort
on the morrow about eight oclock the head man came again and said
that nala request that i would visit him i follow him into the
privat enclosur and wa introduc to the chief a finelook man
of about fifti with veri delicatelyshap hand and feet and a rather
nervou mouth the chief wa seat on a tan oxhid outsid hi hut
by hi side stood hi daughter maiwa and squat on their haunch
round him were some twenti head men or induna whose number wa
continu ad to by fresh arriv these men salut me as i
enter and the chief rose and took my hand order a stool to be
brought for me to sit on when thi wa done with much eloqu and
nativ courtesi he thank me for protect hi daughter in the pain
and danger circumst in which she found herself place and also
compliment me veri highli upon what he wa pleas to call the
braveri with which i had defend the pass in the rock i answer in
appropri term sai that it wa to maiwa herself that thank were
due for had it not been for her warn and knowledg of the countri we
should not have been here todai while as to the defenc of the pass i
wa fight for my life and that put heart into me
these courtesi conclud nala call upon hi daughter maiwa to tell
her tale to the head men and thi she did most simpli and effect
she remind them that she had gone as an unwil bride to wambethat
no cattl had been paid for her becaus wamb had threaten war if she
wa not sent as a free gift sinc she had enter the kraal of wamb
her dai had been dai of heavi and her night night of weep
she had been beaten she had been neglect and made to do the work of a
lowborn wifesh a chief daughter she had born a child and thi
wa the stori of the child then amidst a dead silenc she told them the
aw tale which she had alreadi narrat to me when she had finish
her hearer gave a loud ejacul ou thei said ou maiwa
daughter of nala
ay she went on with flash ey ay it is true my mouth is as
full of truth as a flower of honei and for tear my ey ar like the
dew upon the grass at dawn it is true i saw the child dieher is the
proof of it councillor and she drew forth the littl dead hand and
held it befor them
ou thei said again ou it is the dead hand
ye she continu it is the dead hand of my dead child and i bear
it with me that i mai never forget never for on short hour that i
live that i mai see wamb die and be aveng will you bear it my
father that your daughter and your daughter child should be so
treat by a matuku will ye bear it men of my own peopl
no said an old induna rise it is not to be born enough have
we suffer at the hand of these matuku dog and their loudtongu
chief let us put it to the issu
it is not to be born inde said nala but how can we make head
against so great a peopl
ask of himask of macumazahn the wise white man said maiwa
point at me
how can we overcom wamb macumazahn the hunter
how doe the jackal overreach the lion nala
by clever macumazahn
so shall you overcom wamb nala
at thi moment an interrupt occur a man enter and said that
messeng had arriv from wamb
what is their messag ask nala
thei come to ask that thy daughter maiwa be sent back and with her
the white hunter
how shall i make answer to thi macumazahn said nala when the man
had withdrawn
thu shalt thou answer i said after reflect sai that the woman
shall be sent and i with her and then bid the messeng be gone stai
i will hide myself here in the hut that the men mai not see me and i
did
shortli afterward through a crack in the hut i saw the messeng
arriv and thei were great truculentlook fellow there were four
of them and evid thei had travel night and dai thei enter
with a swagger and squat down befor nala
your busi said nala frown
we come from wamb bear the order of wamb to nala hi servant
answer the spokesman of the parti
speak said nala with a curiou twitch of hi nervouslook mouth
these ar the word of wamb send back the woman my wife who ha
run awai from my kraal and send with her the white man who ha dare to
hunt in my countri without my leav and to slai my soldier these ar
the word of wamb
and if i sai i will not send them ask nala
then on behalf of wamb we declar war upon you wamb will eat you
up he will wipe you out your kraal shall be stamp flatso and
with an express gestur he drew hi hand across hi mouth to show
how complet would be the annihil of that chief who dare to defi
wamb
these ar heavi word said nala let me take counsel befor i
answer
then follow a littl piec of act that wa realli veri credit
to the untutor savag mind the herald withdrew but not out of
sight and nala went through the show of earnestli consult hi
induna the girl maiwa too flung herself at hi feet and appear to
weep and implor hi protect while he wrung hi hand as though in
doubt and tribul of mind at length he summon the messeng to
draw near and address them while maiwa sob veri realist at
hi side
wamb is a great chief said nala and thi woman is hi wife whom
he ha a right to claim she must return to him but her feet ar sore
with walk she cannot come now in eight dai from thi dai she shall
be deliv at the kraal of wamb i will send her with a parti of my
men as for the white hunter and hi men i have nought to do with them
and cannot answer for their misde thei have wander hither unbidden
by me and i will deliv them back whenc thei came that wamb mai
judg them accord to hi law thei shall be sent with the girl for
you go your wai food shall be given you without the kraal and a
present for wamb in aton of the illdo of my daughter i have
spoken
at first the herald seem inclin to insist upon maiwa
accompani them then and there but on be shown the swollen
condit of her feet ultim thei gave up the point and depart
when thei were well out of the wai i emerg from the hut and we went
on to discuss the situat and make our plan first of all as i wa
care to explain to nala i wa not go to give him my experi
and servic for noth i heard that wamb had a stockad round
hi kraal made of eleph tusk these tusk in the event of our
succeed in the enterpris i should claim as my perquisit with the
proviso that nala should furnish me with men to carri them down to the
coast
to thi modest request nala and the head men gave an unqualifi and
hearti assent the more hearti perhap becaus thei never expect to
get the ivori
the next thing i stipul wa that if we conquer the white man
john everi should be hand over to me togeth with ani good which he
might claim hi cruel captiv wa i need hardli sai the onli reason
that induc me to join in so hairbrain an expedit but i wa
care from motiv of polici to keep thi fact in the background
nala accept thi condit my third stipul wa that no women
or children should be kill thi be also agre to we went on to
consid wai and mean wamb it appear wa a veri power petti
chief that is he could put at least six thousand fight men into the
field and alwai had from three to four thousand collect about hi
kraal which wa suppos to be impregn nala on the contrari at
such short notic could not collect more than from twelv to thirteen
hundr men though be of the zulu stock thei were of much better
stuff for fight purpos than wamb matuku
these odd though larg under the circumst were not
overwhelm the real obstacl to our chanc of success wa the
difficulti of deliv a crush assault against wamb strong
place thi wa it appear fortifi all round with schans or stone
wall and contain numer cave and koppi in the hillsid and at
the foot of the mountain which no forc had ever been abl to captur
it is said that in the time of the zulu monarch dingaan a great impi of
that king have penetr to thi district had deliv an assault
upon the kraal then own by a forefath of wamb and been beaten
back with the loss of more than a thousand men
have thought the question over i interrog maiwa close as to
the fortif and the topograph peculiar of the spot and
not without result i discov that the kraal wa inde impregn
to a front attack but that it wa veri slightli defend to the rear
which ran up a slope of the mountain inde onli by two line of stone
wall the reason of thi wa that the mountain is quit impass
except by on secret path suppos to be known onli to the chief and hi
councillor and thi be so it had not been consid necessari to
fortifi it
well i said when she had done and now as to thi secret path of
thineknowest thou aught of it
ay she answer i am no fool macumazahn knowledg learn is
power earn i won the secret of that path
and canst thou guid an impi thereon so that it shall fall upon the
town from behind
ye i can do thi if onli wamb peopl know not that the impi
come for if thei know then thei can block the wai
so then here is my plan listen nala and sai if it be good or if
thou hast a better show it forth let messeng go out and summon all
thy impi that it be gather here on the third dai from now thi be
done let the impi led by maiwa march on the morrow of the fourth dai
and cross the mountain let it travel along on the other side of the
mountain till it come to the place on the further side of which is the
kraal of wamb that shall be some three dai journei in all then
on the night of the third dai journei let maiwa lead the impi
in silenc up the secret path so that it come to the crest of the
mountain that is abov the strong place and here let it hide among the
rock
about on hundr and twenti mileseditor
meanwhil on the sixth dai from now let on of thy induna nala
bring with him two hundr men that have gun and lead me and my men
as prison and take also a girl from among the butiana peopl who
by form and face is like unto maiwa and bind her hand and pass by
the road on which we came and through the cut in the cliff on to the
kraal of wamb but the men shall take no shield or plume with them
onli their gun and on short spear and when thei meet the peopl of
wamb thei shall sai that thei come to give up the woman and the white
man and hi parti to wamb and to make aton to wamb so shall
thei pass in peac and travel thu on the even of the seventh
dai we shall come to the gate of the place of wamb and nigh the gate
there is so sai maiwa a koppi veri strong and full of rock and
cave but have no soldier on it except in time of war or at the
worst but a few such as can easili be overpow
thi be done at the dawn of dai the impi on the mountain behind
the town must light a fire and put wet grass on it so that the smoke
goe up then at the sight of the smoke we in the koppi will begin to
shoot into the town of wamb and all the soldier will run to kill us
but we will hold our own and while we fight the impi shall charg down
the mountain side and climb the schans and put those who defend them
to the assegai and then fall upon the town shall surpris it and
drive the soldier of wamb as a wind blow the dead husk of corn thi
is my plan i have spoken
ou said nala it is good it is veri good the white man is
clever than a jackal ye so shall it be and mai the snake of the
butiana peopl stand up upon it tail and prosper the war for so shall
we be rid of wamb and the tyranni of wamb
after that the girl maiwa stood up and onc more produc the
dread littl dri hand made her father and sever of hi head
councillor swear by it and upon it that thei would carri out the war of
vengeanc to the bitter end it wa a veri curiou sight to see and by
the wai the fight that ensu wa thereaft known among the tribe of
that district as the war of the littl hand
the next two dai were busi on for us messeng were sent out
and everi avail man of the butiana tribe wa order up to a great
danc the countri wa small and by the even of the second dai
some twelv hundr and fifti men were assembl with their assegai and
shield and a fine hardi troop thei were at dawn of the follow dai
the fourth from the departur of the herald the main impi have
been doctor in the usual fashion start under the command of nala
himself who know that hi life and chieftainship hung upon the
issu of the struggl wise determin to be present to direct it
with them went maiwa who wa to guid them up the secret path of
cours we were oblig to give them two dai start as thei had more
than a hundr mile of rough countri to pass includ the cross of
the great mountain rang which ran north and south for it wa necessari
that the impi should make a wide dtour in order to escap detect
at length howev at dawn on the sixth dai i took the road
accompani by my most unwil bearer who did not at all like the
idea of thu put their head into the lion mouth inde it wa
onli the fear of nala spear togeth with a vagu confid in
myself that induc them to accept the adventur with me also were
about two hundr butiana all arm with gun of variou kind for
mani of these peopl had gun though thei were not veri profici in
the us of them but thei carri no shield and wore no headdress or
armlet inde everi warlik appear wa carefulli avoid with
our parti went also a sister of maiwa though by a differ mother
who strongli resembl her in face and form and whose mission it wa to
imperson the runawai wife
that even we camp upon the top of the cliff up which we had so
bare escap and next morn at the first break of the light we
roll awai the stone with which we had block the passag some dai
befor and descend to the hillsid beneath here the bodi or
rather the skeleton of the men who had fallen befor my rifl still
lai about the matuku soldier had left their comrad to be buri by
the vultur i descend the gulli into which poor gobo had fallen and
search for hi bodi but in vain although i found the spot where he
and the other man had struck togeth with the bone of the latter
which i recogn by the waistcloth either some beast of prei had
carri gobo off or the matuku peopl had dispos of hi remain and
also of my express rifl which he carri at ani rate i never saw or
heard ani more of him
onc in wamb countri we adopt a veri circumspect method of
proceed about fifti men march ahead in loos order to guard
against surpris while as mani more follow behind the remain
hundr were gather in a bunch between and in the centr of these men
i march togeth with the girl who wa person maiwa and all my
bearer we were disarm and some of my men were ti togeth to show
that we were prison while the girl had a blanket thrown over her
head and move along with an air of great deject we head straight
for wamb place which wa at a distanc of about twentyf mile
from the mountainpass
when we had gone some five mile we met a parti of about fifti of
wamb soldier who were evid on the lookout for us thei
stop us and their captain ask where we were go the head man
of our parti answer that he wa convei maiwa wamb runawai wife
togeth with the white hunter and hi men to be given up to wamb in
accord with hi command the captain then want to know why we
were so mani to which our spokesman repli that i and my men were veri
desper fellow and that it wa fear that if we were sent with a
smaller escort we should escap and bring disgrac and the wrath of
wamb upon their tribe thereon thi gentleman the matuku captain
began to amus himself at my expens and mock me sai that wamb
would make me pai for the soldier whom i had kill he would put me
into the thing that bite in other word the lion trap and leav me
there to die like a jackal caught by the leg i made no answer to thi
though my wrath wa great but pretend to look frighten inde
there wa not much pretenc about it i wa frighten i could not
conceal from myself that our wa a most hazard enterpris and that
it wa veri possibl that i might make acquaint with that lion trap
befor i wa mani dai older howev it seem quit imposs to
desert poor everi in hi misfortun so i had to go on and trust to
provid as i have so often been oblig to do befor and sinc
and now a fresh difficulti aros wamb soldier insist upon
accompani us and what is more did all thei could to urg us
forward as thei were natur anxiou to get to the chief place
befor even but we on the other hand had excel reason for not
arriv till night wa close in sinc we reli upon the gloom to
cover our advanc upon the koppi which command the town final
thei becam so importun that we were oblig to refus flatli to
move faster alleg as a reason that the girl wa tire thei did
not accept thi excus in good part and at on time i thought that we
should have come to blow for there is no love lost between butiana
and matuku at last howev either from motiv of polici or becaus
thei were so evid outnumb thei gave in and suffer us to
go our own pace i earnestli wish that thei would have ad to the
oblig by go their but thi thei declin absolut to do on
the contrari thei accompani us everi foot of the wai keep up a
run fire of allus to the thing that bite that jar upon my
nerv and discompos my temper
about halfpast four in the afternoon we came to a neck or ridg of
stoni ground whenc we could see wamb town plainli ly some six or
seven mile awai and three thousand feet beneath us the town is built
in a vallei with the except of wamb own kraal that is situat
at the mouth of some cave upon the slope of the oppos mountain
over which i hope to see our impi spear flash in the morrow
light even from where we stood it wa easi to see how strongli the
place wa fortifi with schans and stone wall and how difficult
of approach inde unless taken by surpris it seem to me quit
impregn to a forc oper without cannon and even cannon would
not make much impress on rock and stoni koppi fill with cave
then came the descent of the pass and an arduou busi it wa for
the pathif it mai be call a pathi almost entir compos of
huge waterworn boulder from the on to the other of which we must
jump like so mani grasshopp it took us two hour to climb down
and travel through that burn sun when at last we did reach the
bottom i for on wa nearli plai out shortli afterward just as
it wa grow dark we came to the first line of fortif which
consist of a tripl stone wall pierc by a gatewai so narrow that
a man could hardli squeez through it we pass thi without question
be accompani by wamb soldier then came a belt of land three
hundr pace or more in width veri rocki and broken and have no
hut upon it here in hollow in thi belt the cattl were kraal in
case of danger on the further side were more fortif and anoth
small gatewai shape like a v and just beyond and through it i saw the
koppi we had plan to seiz loom up against the line of mountain
behind
as we went i whisper my suggest to our captain with the result
that at the second gatewai he halt the cavalcad and address
the captain of wamb soldier said that we would wait here till we
receiv wamb word to enter the town the other man said that thi
wa well onli he must hand over the prison to be taken up to the
chief kraal for wamb wa hungri to begin upon them and hi
heart desir to see the white man at rest befor he close hi ey in
sleep and as for hi wife sure he would welcom her our leader
repli that he could not do thi thing becaus hi order were to
deliv the prison to wamb at wamb own kraal and thei might not
be broken how could he be respons for the safeti of the prison
if he let them out of hi hand no thei would wait there till wamb
word wa brought
to thi after some demur the other man consent and went awai
remark that he would soon be back as he pass me he call out
with a sneer point as he did so to the fade red in the western
skylook your last upon the light white man for the thing that
bite live in the dark
next dai it so happen that i shot thi man and do you know i think
that he is about the onli human be who ha come to harm at my hand
for whom i do not feel sincer sorrow and in a degre remors
viith attack
just where we halt ran a littl stream of water i look at it and
an idea struck me probabl there would be no water on the koppi i
suggest thi to our captain and act on the hint he direct all
the men to drink what thei could and also to fill the seven or eight
cook pot which we carri with us with water then came the crucial
moment how were we to get possess of the koppi when the captain
ask me i said that i thought that we had better march up and take
it and thi accordingli we went on to do when we came to the narrow
gatewai we were as i expect stop by two soldier who stood on
guard there and ask our busi the captain answer that we had
chang our mind and would follow on to wamb kraal the soldier
said no we must now wait
to thi we repli by push them to on side and march in singl
file through the gatewai which wa not distant more than a hundr
yard from the koppi while we were get through the men we had
push awai ran toward the town call for assist a call that wa
promptli respond to for in anoth minut we saw score of arm men
run hard in our direct so we ran too for the koppi as soon as
thei understood what we were after which thei did not at first ow
to the dim of the light thei did their best to get there befor us
but we had the start of them and with the except of on unfortun
man who stumbl and fell we were well on to the koppi befor
thei arriv thi man thei captur and when fight began on the
follow morn and he refus to give ani inform thei kill
him luckili thei had no time to tortur him or thei would certainli
have done so for these matuku peopl ar veri fond of tortur their
enemi
when we reach the koppi the base of which cover about half an acr
of ground the soldier who had been try to cut us off halt for
thei knew the strength of the posit thi gave us a few minut
befor the light had quit vanish to reconnoitr the place we found
that it wa unoccupi fortifi with a regular labyrinth of stone
wall and contain three larg cave and some smaller on the next
busi wa to post the soldier to such advantag as time would allow
my own men i wa care to place quit at the top thei were perfectli
useless from terror and i fear that thei might try to escap and give
inform of our plan to wamb so i watch them like the appl of
my ey tell them that should thei dare to stir thei would be shot
then it grew quit dark and present out of the dark i heard
a voiceit wa that of the leader of the soldier who had escort
uscal us to come down we repli that it wa too dark to move we
should hit our feet against the stone he insist upon our descend
and we flatli refus sai that if ani attempt wa made to dislodg
us we would fire after that as thei had no real intent of attack
us in the dark the men withdrew but we saw from the fire which were
lit around that thei were keep a strict watch upon our posit
that night wa a wear on for we never quit knew how the situat
wa go to develop fortun we had some cook food with us so
we did not starv it wa lucki howev that we drunk our fill befor
come up for as i had anticip there wa not a drop of water on
the koppi
at length the night wore awai and with the first ting of light i
began to go my round and stumbl along the stoni path to make
thing as readi as i could for the attack which i felt sure would be
deliv befor we were two hour older the men were cramp and cold
and consequ lowspirit but i exhort them to the best of my
abil bid them rememb the race from which thei sprang and not
to show the white feather befor a crowd of matuku dog at length it
began to grow light and present i saw long column of men advanc
toward the koppi thei halt under cover at a distanc of about
a hundr and fifti yard and just as the dawn broke a herald came
forward and call to us our captain stood up upon a rock and answer
him
these ar the word of wamb the herald said come forth from the
koppi and give over the evildo and go in peac or stai in the
koppi and be slain
it is too earli to come out as yet answer our man in fine
diplomat style when the sun suck up the mist then we will come out
our limb ar stiff with cold
come forth even now said the herald
not if i know it my boi said i to myself but the captain repli
that he would come out when he thought proper and not befor
then make readi to die said the herald for all the world like the
villain of a transpontin piec and majest stalk back to the
soldier
i made my final arrang and look anxious at the mountain
crest a coupl of mile or so awai from which the mist wa now
begin to lift but no column of smoke could i see i whistl
for if the attack forc had been delai or made ani mistak our
posit wa like to grow rather warm we had bare enough water to
wet the mouth of the men and when onc it wa finish we could not
hold the place for long in that burn heat
at length just as the sun rose in glori over the height behind us
the matuku soldier of whom about fifteen hundr were now assembl
set up a queer whistl nois which end in a chant then some shot
were fire for the matuku had a few gun but without effect though
on bullet pass just by a man head
now thei ar go to begin i thought to myself and i wa not
far wrong for in anoth minut the bodi of men divid into three
compani each about five hundr strong and herald by a run
fire charg at us on three side our men were now all well under
cover and the fire did us no harm i mount on a rock so as to command
a view of as much of the koppi and plain as possibl and yell to our
men to reserv their fire till i gave the word and then to shoot low
and load as quickli as possibl i knew that like all nativ thei
were sure to be execr shot and that thei were arm with weapon
made out of old gaspip so the onli chanc of do execut wa to
let the enemi get right on to us
on thei came with a rush thei were within eighti yard now and as
thei drew near the point of attack i observ that thei close their
rank which wa so much the better for us
shall we not fire my father sung out the captain
no confound you i answer
sixti yardsfiftyfortythirti fire you scoundrel i yell
set the exampl by let off both barrel of my eleph gun into
the thickest part of the compani opposit to me
instantli the place rang out with the discharg of two hundr and odd
gun while the air wa torn by the passag of everi sort of missil
from iron pot leg down to slug and pebbl coat with lead the
result wa veri prompt the matuku were so near that we could not miss
them and at thirti yard a leadcoat stone out of a gaspip is as
effect as a martini rifl or more so over roll the attack
soldier by the dozen while the survivor fairli frighten took to
their heel we pli them with shot till thei were out of rangei made
it veri warm for them with the eleph gun by the wayand then we
load up in quit a cheer frame of mind for we had not lost a man
wherea i could count more than fifti dead and wound matuku the onli
thing that damp my ardour wa that stare as i would i could see no
column of smoke upon the mountain crest
half an hour elaps befor ani further step were taken against us
then the attack forc adopt differ tactic see that it
wa veri riski to try to rush us in dens mass thei open out into
skirmish order and ran across the open space in lot of five and six
as it happen right at the foot of the koppi the ground broke awai a
littl in such fashion that it wa almost imposs for us to search
it effectu with our fire on the hither side of thi dip wamb
soldier were now congreg in consider number of cours we did
them as much damag as we could while thei were run across but thi
sort of work requir good shot and that wa just what we had not got
anoth thing wa that so mani of our men would insist upon let off
the thing thei call gun at everi littl knot of the enemi that ran
across thu the first few lot were inde practic swept awai but
after that as it took a long while to load the gaspip and old flint
musket those who follow got across in compar safeti for my own
part i fire awai with the eleph gun and repeat carbin till thei
grew almost too hot to hold but my individu effort could do noth
to stop such a rush or percept to lessen the number of our enemi
at length there were at least a thousand men crowd into the dip of
ground within a few yard of us whenc those of them who had gun kept
up a continu fusillad upon the koppi thei kill two of my bearer
in thi wai and wound a third for be at the top of the koppi
these men were most expos to the fire from the dip at it base see
that the situat wa grow most seriou at length by the dint of
threat and entreati i persuad the major of our peopl to ceas
fire useless shot to reload and prepar for the rush scarc had
i done so when the enemi came for us with a roar i am bound to sai that
i should never have believ that matuku had it in them to make such
a determin charg a larg parti rush round the base of the koppi
and attack us in flank while the other swarm wherev thei could
get a foothold so that we were taken on everi side
fire i cri and we did with terribl effect mani of their men
fell but though we check we could not stop them thei close up and
rush the first fortif kill a good number of it defend
it wa almost all cold steel work now for we had no time to reload and
that suit the butiana habit of fight well enough for the stab
assegai is a weapon which thei understand those of our peopl who
escap from the first line of wall took refug in the second where
i stood myself encourag them and there the fight rage fierc
occasion parti of the enemi would forc a passag onli to perish
on the hither side beneath the butiana spear but still thei kept
it up and i saw that fight as we would we were doom we were
altogeth outnumb and to make matter wors fresh bodi
of soldier were pour across the plain to the assist of our
assail so i made up my mind to direct a retreat into the cave
and there expir in a manner as heroic as circumst would allow and
while mental lament my hard fate and reflect on my sin i fought
awai like a fiend it wa then i rememb that i shot my friend the
captain of our escort of the previou dai he had caught sight of
me and make a viciou dig at my stomach with a spear which i
successfulli dodg shout out or rather began to shout out on of
hi unpleas allus to the thing that he never got as far as
bite becaus i shot him after that
well the game wa about up alreadi i saw on man throw down hi spear
in token of surrenderwhich act of cowardic cost him hi life by the
waywhen suddenli a shout aros
look at the mountain thei cri there is an impi on the mountain
side
i glanc up and there sure enough about halfwai down the mountain
near the first fortif the longplum doubl line of nala
warrior wa rush down to battl the bright light of the morn
glanc on their spear afterward we discov that the reason of
their delai wa that thei had been stop by a river in flood and
could not reach the mountain crest by dawn when thei did reach it
howev thei saw instantli that the fight wa alreadi go on wa
in flower as thei put it and so advanc at onc without wait to
light signalfir
meanwhil thei had been observ from the town and parti of soldier
were charg up the steep side of the hill to occupi the schans and
the second line of fortif behind them the first line thei did
not now attempt to reach or defend nala press them too close
but thei got to the schans or pit protect with stone wall and
construct to hold from a dozen to twenti men and soon began to open
fire from them and from isol rock i turn my ey to the gate
of the town which were place to the north and south alreadi thei were
crowd with hundr of fugit women and children fly to the rock
and cave for shelter from the foe
as for ourselv the appear of nala impi produc a wonder
chang for the better in our posit the soldier attack us turn
realiz that the town wa be assail from the rear and clamber
down the koppi stream off to protect their home against thi new
enemi in five minut there wa not a man left except those who would
move no more or were too sore wound to escap i felt inclin to
ejacul save like the gentleman in the plai but did not becaus
the occas wa too seriou what i did do wa to muster all the men
and reckon up our loss thei amount to fiftyon kill and wound
sixteen men have been kill outright then i sent men with the
cookingpot to the stream of water and we drank thi done i set my
bearer be the most useless part of the commun from a fight
point of view to the task of attend the injur and turn to watch
the frai
by thi time nala impi had climb the first line of fortif
without opposit and wa advanc in a long line upon the schans
or pit which were scatter about between it and the second line
sing a war chant as it came present puff of smoke began to start
from the schans and with my glass i could see sever of our men
fall over then as thei came opposit a schans that portion of the
long line of warrior would thicken up and charg it with a wild rush i
could see them leap on to the wall and vanish into the depth beneath
some of their number fall backward on each occas shot or stab
to death
next would come anoth act in the tragedi out from the hither side of
the schans would pour such of it defend as were left aliv perhap
three or four and perhap a dozen run for dear life with the war
dog on their track on by on thei would be caught then up flash
the great spear and down fell the pursueddead i saw ten of our men
leap into on larg schans but though i watch for some time nobodi
came out afterward we inspect the place and found these men all
dead togeth with twentythre matuku neither side would give in
and thei had fought it out to the bitter end
at last thei near the second line of fortif behind which
the whole remain matuku forc number some two thousand men wa
rapidli assembl on littl paus to get their breath and nala men
came at it with a rush and a long wild shout of bulala matuku kill
the matuku that went right through me thrill everi nerv then came
an answer shout and the sound of heavi fire and present i saw
our men retreat somewhat fewer in number than thei had advanc
their welcom had been a warm on for the matuku fight splendidli behind
wall thi decid me that it wa necessari to creat a divers if
we did not do so it seem veri probabl that we should be worst after
all i call to the captain of our littl forc and rapidli put the
posit befor him
see the urgenc of the occas he agre with me that we must risk
it and in two minut more with the except of my own men whom i
left to guard the wound we were trot across the open space and
through the desert town toward the spot where the struggl wa take
place some seven hundr yard awai in six or eight minut we reach
a group of hutsit wa a head man kraal that wa situat about a
hundr and twenti yard behind the fortifi wall and took possess
of it unobserv the enemi wa too much engag with the foe in front
of him to notic us and besid the broken ground rose in a hogback
shape between there we wait a minut or two and recov our breath
while i gave my direct so soon as we heard the butiana impi begin
to charg again we were to run out in a line to the brow of the hogback
and pour our fire into the mass of defend behind the wall then the
gun were to be thrown down and we must charg with the assegai we
had no shield but that could not be help there would be no time to
reload the gun and it wa absolut necessari that the enemi should
be disconcert at the moment when the main attack wa deliv
the men who were as plucki a set of fellow as ever i saw and whose
blood wa now thoroughli up consent to thi scheme though i could
see that thei thought it rather a larg order as inde i did myself
but i knew that if the impi wa driven back a second time the game would
be plai and for me at ani rate it would be a case of the thing
that bite and thi sure and certain knowledg fill my breast with
valour
we had not long to wait present we heard the butiana warsong
swell loud and long thei had commenc their attack i made a sign
and the hundr and fifti men head by myself pour out of the
kraal and get into a rough line ran up the fifti or sixti yard of
slope that interven between ourselv and the crest of the hogback
ridg in thirti second we were there and immedi beyond us wa
the main bodi of the matuku host wait the onslaught of the enemi with
gun and spear even now thei did not see us so intent were thei upon
the come attack i sign to my men to take care aim and suddenli
call out to them to fire which thei did with a will drop thirti
or forti matuku
charg i shout again throw down my smoke rifl and draw
my revolv an exampl which thei follow snatch up their spear
from the ground where thei had place them while thei fire the men
set up a savag whoop and we start i saw the matuku soldier wheel
around in hundr utterli taken aback at thi new develop of the
situat and look over them befor we had gone twenti yard i
saw someth els for of a sudden as though thei had risen from the
earth there appear abov the wall hundr of great spear follow
by hundr of savag face shadow with droop plume with a yell
thei sprang upon the wall shake their broad shield and with a yell
thei bound from it straight into our astonish foe
crash we were in them now and fight like demon crash from
the other side nala impi wa at it work and still the spear
and plume appear for a moment against the brown background of the
mountain and then sprang down and rush like a storm upon the foe
the great mob of men turn thi wai and turn that wai astonish
bewild overborn by doubt and terror
meanwhil the slayer stai not their hand and on everi side spear
flash and the fierc shout of triumph went up to heaven there too on
the wall stood maiwa a white garment stream from her shoulder an
assegai in her hand her breast heav her ey flash abov all
the din of battl i could catch the tone of her clear voic as she
urg the soldier on to victori but victori wa not yet wamb
soldier gather themselv togeth and bore our men back by the
sheer weight of number thei began to give then onc more thei
ralli and the fight hung doubtfulli
slai you warwhelp cri maiwa from the wall ar you afraid
you women you chickenheart women strike home or die like dog
whatyou give wai follow me children of nala and with on long cry
she leapt from the wall as leap a stricken antelop and hold the
spear pois rush right into the thickest of the frai the warrior
saw her and rais such a shout that it echo like thunder against the
mountain thei mass togeth and follow the flutter of her white
robe crash into the dens heart of the foe down went the matuku
befor them like tree befor a whirlwind noth could stand in the
face of such a rush as that it wa as the rush of a torrent burst
it bank all along their line swept the wild desper charg and
there straight in the forefront of the battl still wave the white
robe of maiwa
then thei broke and stricken with utter panic wamb soldier
stream awai a scatter crowd of fugit while after them thunder
the footfal of the victor
the fight wa over we had won the dai and for my part i sat down upon
a stone and wipe my forehead thank provid that i had live to
see the end of it twenti minut later nala warrior began to return
pant wamb soldier had taken to the bush and the cave thei
said where thei had not thought it safe to follow them ad
significantli that mani had stop on the wai
i wa utterli daze and now that the fight wa over my energi seem
to have left me and i did not pai much attent till present i wa
arous by somebodi call me by my name i look up and saw that it
wa the chief nala himself who wa bleed from a flesh wound in hi
arm by hi side stood maiwa pant but unhurt and wear on her
face a proud and terrifi air
thei ar gone macumazahn said the chief there is littl to fear
from them their heart is broken but where is wamb the chiefand
where is the white man thou camest to save
i know not i answer
close to where we stood lai a matuku a young man who had been shot
through the fleshi part of the calf it wa a trifl wound but it
prevent him from run awai
sai thou dog said nala stalk up to him and shake hi red
spear in hi face sai where is wamb speak or i slai thee wa he
with the soldier
nai lord i know not groan the terrifi man he fought not
with us wamb ha no stomach for fight perchanc he is in hi kraal
yonder or in the cave behind the kraal and he point to a small
enclosur on the hillsid about four hundr yard to the right of
where we were
let us go and see said nala summon hi soldier
viiimaiwa is aveng
the impi form up ala an hour befor it had been stronger by a
third than it wa now then nala detach two hundr men to collect
and attend to the injur and at my suggest issu a stringent order
that none of the enemi wound and abov all no women or children
were to be kill as is the savag custom among african nativ on the
contrari thei were to be allow to send word to their women that thei
might come in to nurs them and fear noth for nala made war upon
wamb the tyrant and not on the matuku tribe
then we start with some four hundr men for the chief kraal veri
soon we were there it wa as i have said place against the mountain
side but within the fortifi line and did not at all cover more
than an acr and a half of ground outsid wa a tini reed fenc within
which neatli arrang in a semicircular line stood the hut of the
chief princip wive maiwa of cours knew everi inch of the kraal
for she had live in it and led us straight to the entranc we peep
through the gatewaynot a soul wa to be seen there were the hut and
there wa the clear open space floor with a concret of lime on which
the sun beat fierc but nobodi could we see or hear
the jackal ha gone to earth said maiwa he will be in the cave
behind hi hut and she point with her spear toward anoth small
and semicircular enclosur over which a larg hut wa visibl that
had the cliff itself for a background i stare at thi fenc by
georg it wa true it wa entir made of tusk of ivori plant in
the ground with their point bend outward the smallest on though
none were small were place nearest to the cliff on either side but
thei gradual increas in size till thei culmin in two enorm
tusk which set up so that their point met someth in the shape of
an invert v form the gatewai to the hut i wa dumbfound with
delight and inde where is the elephanthunt who would not be if
he suddenli saw five or six hundr pick tusk set up in a row and
onli wait for him to take them awai of cours the stuff wa what is
known as black ivori that is the exterior of the tusk had becom
black from year or perhap centuri of exposur to wind and weather
but i wa certain that it would be none the wors for that forget
the danger of the deed in my excit i actual ran right across
the open space and draw my knife scratch vigor at on of the
great tusk to see how deep the damag might be as i thought it wa
noth there beneath the black cover gleam the pure white ivori
i could have caper for joi for i fear that i am veri mercenari at
heart when suddenli i heard the faint echo of a cry for assist
help scream a voic in the sisutu dialect from somewher behind the
hut help thei ar murder me
i knew the voic it wa john everi oh what a selfish brute wa
i for the moment that miser ivori had driven the recollect of
him out of my head and nowperhap it wa too late
nala maiwa and the soldier had now come up thei too heard the voic
and interpret it tone though thei had not caught the word
thi wai cri maiwa and we start at a run pass round the hut
of wamb behind wa the narrow entranc to a cave we rush through
it heedless of the danger of the ambush and thi is what we saw though
veri confusedli at first ow to the gloom
in the centr of the cave and with either end secur to the floor by
strong stake stood a huge doublespring lion trap edg with sharp
and grin teeth it wa set and beyond the trap inde almost over
it a terribl struggl wa in progress a nake or almost nake white
man with a great beard hang down over hi breast in spite of hi
furiou struggl wa be slowli forc and drag toward the trap
by six or eight women onli on man wa present a fat cruellook
man with small ey and a hang lip it wa the chief wamb and he
stood by the trap readi to forc the victim down upon it so soon as the
women had drag him into the necessari posit
at thi instant thei caught sight of us and there came a moment
paus and then befor i knew what she wa go to do maiwa lift
the assegai she still held and whirl it at wamb head i saw the
flash of light speed toward him and so did he for he step backward
to avoid itstep backward right into the trap he yell with pain
as the iron teeth of the thing that bite sprang up with a rattl
sound like live fang and fasten into himsuch a yell i have not
often heard now at last he tast of the tortur which he had inflict
upon so mani and though i trust i am a christian i cannot sai that i
felt sorri for him
the assegai sped on and struck on of the women who had hold of the
unfortun everi pierc through her arm thi made her leav go an
exampl that the other women quickli follow so that everi fell to the
ground where he lai gasp
kill the witch roar nala in a voic of thunder point to the
group of women
nai gasp everi spare them he made them do it and he point
to the human fiend in the trap then maiwa wave her hand to us to
fall back for the moment of her vengeanc wa come we did so and she
strode up to her lord and fling the white robe from her stood befor
him her fierc beauti face fix like stone
who am i she cri in so terribl a voic that he ceas hi yell
am i that woman who wa given to thee for wife and whose child thou
slewest or am i an aveng spirit come to see thee die
what is thi she went on draw the wither babyhand from the
pouch at her side
is it the hand of a babe and how came that hand to be thu alon
what cut it off from the babe and where is the babe is it a hand or
is it the vision of a hand that shall present tear thy throat
where ar thy soldier wamb do thei sleep and eat and go forth to
do thy bid or ar thei perchanc dead and scatter like the winter
leav
he groan and roll hi ey while the fiercefac woman went on
art thou still a chief wamb or doe anoth take thy place and
power and sai lord what doest thou there and what is that slave
leglet upon thy knee
is it a dream wamb great lord and chief orand she lift her
clench hand and shook them in hi facehath a woman vengeanc
found thee out and a woman wit oermatch thy tyrann strength and
art thou about to slowli die in torment horribl to think on oh thou
accurs murder of littl children
and with on wild scream she dash the dead hand of the child straight
into hi face and then fell senseless on the floor as for the demon
in the trap he shrank back so far as it iron bound would allow hi
yellow ey start out of hi head with pain and terror and then onc
more began to yell
the scene wa more than i could bear
nala i said thi must stop that man is a fiend but he must not
be left to die there see thou to it
nai answer nala let him tast of the food wherewith he hath fed
so mani leav him till death shall find him
that i will not i answer let hi end be swift see thou to it
as thou wilt macumazahn answer the chief with a shrug of the
shoulder first let the white man and maiwa be brought forth
so the soldier came forward and carri everi and the woman into the
open air as the former wa born past hi tormentor the fallen chief
so cowardli wa hi wick heart actual prai him to interced
for him and save him from a fate which but for our providenti
appear would have been everi own
so we went awai and in anoth moment on of the biggest villain on
the earth troubl it no more onc in the fresh air everi recov
quickli i look at him and horror and sorrow pierc me through to
see such a sight hi face wa the face of a man of sixti though he
wa not yet forti and hi poor bodi wa cut to piec with stripe and
scar and other mark of the torment which wamb had for year amus
himself with inflict on him
as soon as he recov himself a littl he struggl on to hi
knee burst into a paroxysm of weep and clasp my leg with hi
emaci arm would have actual kiss my feet
what ar you about old fellow i said for i am not accustom to
that sort of thing and it made me feel uncomfort
oh god bless you he moan god bless you if onli you knew what
i have gone through and to think that you should have come to help
me and at the risk of your own life well you were alwai a true
friendy ye a true friend
bosh i answer testili im a trader and i came after that
ivori and i point to the stockad of tusk did you ever hear of
an elephanthunt who would not have risk hi immort soul for them
and much more hi carcas
but he took no notic of my explan and went on god bless me
as hard as ever till at last i bethought me that a nip of brandi of
which i had a flask full might steadi hi nerv a bit i gave it him
and wa not disappoint in the result for he brisk up wonderfulli
then i hunt about in wamb hut and found a kaross to put over hi
poor bruis shoulder and he wa quit a man again
now i said why did the late lament wamb want to put you in that
trap
becaus as soon as thei heard that the fight wa go against them
and that maiwa wa charg at the head of nala impi on of the women
told wamb that she had seen me write someth on some leav and give
them to maiwa befor she went awai to purifi herself then of cours
he guess that i had to do with your seiz the koppi and hold it
while the impi rush the place from the mountain so he determin to
tortur me to death befor help could come oh heaven what a merci it
is to hear english again
how long have you been a prison here everi i ask
six year and a bit quatermain i have lost count of the odd month
late i came up here with major aldei and three other gentlemen and
forti bearer that devil wamb ambush us and murder the lot to
get their gun thei werent much us to him when he got them be
breechload for the fool fire awai all the ammunit in a month
or two howev thei ar all in good order and hang up in the hut
there thei didnt kill me becaus on of them saw me mend a gun just
befor thei attack us so thei kept me as a kind of armour twice
i tri to make a bolt of it but wa caught each time last time wamb
had me flog veri nearli to deathyou can see the scar upon my back
inde i should have di if it hadnt been for the girl maiwa who
nurs me by stealth he got that accurs lion trap among our thing
also and i suppos he ha tortur between on and two hundr peopl
to death in it it wa hi favourit amus and he would go everi
dai and sit and watch hi victim till he di sometim he would give
him food and water to keep him aliv longer tell him or her that he
would let him go if he live till a certain dai but he never did let
them go thei all di there and i could show you their bone behind
that rock
the devil i said grind my teeth i wish i hadnt interf i
wish i had left him to the same fate
well he got a tast of it ani wai said everi im glad he got
a tast there justic in it and now he gone to hell and i hope
there is anoth on readi for him there by jove i should like to have
the set of it
and so he talk on and i sat and listen to him wonder how he
had kept hi reason for so mani year but he didnt talk as i have told
it in plain english he spoke veri slowli and as though he had got
someth in hi mouth continu us nativ word becaus the
english on had slip hi memori
at last nala came up and told us that food wa made readi and thank
enough we were to get it i can tell you after we had eaten we held
a consult quit a thousand of wamb soldier were put hor
de combat but at least two thousand remain hidden in the bush and
rock and these men togeth with those in the outli kraal were a
sourc of possibl danger the question aros therefor what wa to
be donewer thei to be follow or left alon i wait till everybodi
had spoken some give on opinion and some anoth and then be
appeal to i gave mine it wa to the effect that nala should take a
leaf out of the great zulu tchaka book and incorpor the tribe
not destroi it we had a good mani women among the prison let them
i suggest be sent to the hidingplac of the soldier and make
an offer if the men would come and lai down their arm and declar
allegi to nala thei and their town and cattl should be spare
wamb cattl alon would be seiz as the prize of war moreov
wamb have left no children hi wife maiwa should be declar
chieftai of the tribe under nala if thei did not accept thi offer
by the morn of the second dai it should be taken as a declar
that thei wish to continu the war their town should be burn their
cattl which our men were alreadi collect and drive in in great
number would be taken and thei should be hunt down
thi advic wa at onc declar to be wise and act on the women
were despatch and i saw from their face that thei never expect to
get such term and did not think that their mission would be in vain
nevertheless we spent that afternoon in prepar against possibl
surpris and also in collect all the wound of both parti into a
hospit which we extempor out of some hut and there attend to
them as best we could
that even everi had the first pipe of tobacco that he had tast
for six year poor fellow he nearli cri with joi over it the night
pass without ani sign of attack and on the follow morn we began
to see the effect of our messag for women children and a few men
came in in littl knot and took possess of their hut it wa of
cours rather difficult to prevent our men from loot and gener
go on as nativ and for the matter of that white men too ar in
the habit of do after a victori but on man who after warn wa
caught maltreat a woman wa brought out and kill by nala order
and though there wa a littl grumbl that put a stop to further
troubl
on the second morn the head men and number of their follow came
in in group and about middai a deput of the former present
themselv befor us without their weapon thei were conquer thei
said and wamb wa dead so thei came to hear the word of the great
lion who had eaten them up and of the crafti white man the jackal who
had dug a hole for them to fall in and of maiwa ladi of war who had
led the charg and turn the fate of the battl
so we let them hear the word and when we had done an old man rose and
said that in the name of the peopl he accept the yoke that wa laid
upon their shoulder and that the more gladli becaus even the rule of
a woman could not be wors than the rule of wamb moreov thei knew
maiwa the ladi of war and fear her not though she wa a witch and
terribl to see in battl
then nala ask hi daughter if she wa will to becom chieftai
of the tribe under him
maiwa who had been veri silent sinc her reveng wa accomplish
answer ye that she wa and that her rule should be good and gentl
to those who were good and gentl to her but the froward and rebelli
she would smite with a rod of iron which from my knowledg of her
charact i thought exceedingli probabl
the head man repli that that wa a good sai and thei did not
complain at it and so the meet end
next dai we spent in prepar for departur mine consist chiefli
in superintend the dig up of the stockad of ivori tusk which i
did with the greatest satisfact there were some five hundr of them
altogeth i made inquiri about it from everi who told me that the
stockad had been there so long that nobodi seem to know exactli
who had collect the tusk origin there wa howev a kind of
superstiti feel about them which had alwai prevent the chief
from try to sell thi great mass of ivori everi and i examin it
carefulli and found that although it wa so old it qualiti wa realli
as good as ever and there wa veri littl soft ivori in the lot at
first i wa rather afraid lest now that my servic had been render
nala should hesit to part with so much valuabl properti but thi
wa not the case when i spoke to him on the subject he mere said
take it macumazahn take it you have earn it well and to speak
the truth though i sai it who shouldnt i think i had so we press
sever hundr matuku bearer into our servic and next dai march
off with the lot
befor we went i took a formal farewel of maiwa whom we left with a
bodyguard of three hundr men to assist her in settl the countri
she gave me her hand to kiss in a queenli sort of wai and then said
macumazahn you ar a brave man and have been a friend to me in my
need if ever you want help or shelter rememb that maiwa ha a good
memori for friend and foe all i have is your
and so i thank her and went she wa certainli a veri remark
woman a year or two ago i heard that her father nala wa dead and that
she had succeed to the chieftainship of both tribe which she rule
with great justic and firm
i can assur you that we ascend the pass lead to wamb town with
feel veri differ from those with which we had descend it a
few dai befor but if i wa grate for the issu of event you can
easili imagin what poor everi feel were when we got to the top
of the pass befor the whole impi he actual flop down upon hi
knee and thank heaven for hi escap the tear run down hi
face but then as i have said hi nerv were shakenthough now that
hi beard wa trim and he had some sort of cloth on hi back and
hope in hi heart he look a veri differ man from the poor wretch
whom we had rescu from death by tortur
well we separ from nala at the littl stairwai or pass over the
mountaineveri and i and the ivori go down the river which i had
come up a few week befor and the chief return to hi own kraal on
the further side of the mountain he gave us an escort of a hundr
and fifti men howev with instruct to accompani us for six dai
journei and to keep the matuku bearer in order and then return i knew
that in six dai we should be abl to reach a district where porter
were plenti and whenc we could easili get the ivori convei to
delagoa bai
and did you land it up safe i ask
well no said quatermain we lost about a third of it in cross a
river a flood came down suddenli just as the men were cross and mani
of them had to throw down their tusk to save their live we had no
mean of drag it up and so we were oblig to leav it which
wa veri sad howev we sold what remain for nearli seven thousand
pound so we did not do so badli i dont mean that i got seven
thousand pound out of it becaus you see i insist upon everi
take a half share poor fellow he had earn it if ever a man did
he set up a store in the old coloni on the proce and did uncommonli
well
and what did you do with the lion trap ask sir henri
oh i brought that awai with me also and when i reach durban i put
it in my hous but realli i could not bear to sit opposit to it at
night as i smoke vision of that poor woman and the hand of her dead
child would rise up in my mind and also of all the horror of which it
had been the instrument i began to dream at last that it held me by the
leg thi wa too much for my nerv so i just pack it up and ship
it to it maker in england whose name wa stamp upon the steel
send him a letter at the same time to tell him to what purpos the
infern machin had been put i believ that he gave it to some museum
or other
and what becam of the tusk of the three bull which you shot you
must have left them at nala kraal i suppos
the old gentleman face fell at thi question
ah he said that is a veri sad stori nala promis to send them
with my good to my agent at delagoa and so he did but the men who
brought them were unarm and as it happen thei fell in with a
slave caravan under the command of a halfbr portugues who seiz
the tusk and what is wors swore that he had shot them i paid him
out afterward howev he ad with a smile of satisfact but it
did not give me back my tusk which no doubt have been turn into hair
brush long ago and he sigh
well said good that is a capit yarn of your quatermain
but
but what he ask sharpli forese a draw
but i dont think that it wa so good as mine about the ibexit hasnt
the same finish
mr quatermain made no repli good wa beneath it
do you know gentlemen he said it is halfpast two in the morn
and if we ar go to shoot the big wood tomorrow we ought to leav
here at ninethirti sharp
oh if you shoot for a hundr year you will never beat the record of
those three woodcock i said
or of those three eleph ad sir henri
and then we all went to bed and i dream that i had marri maiwa and
wa much afraid of that attract but determin ladi
