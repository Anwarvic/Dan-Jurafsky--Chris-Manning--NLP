thi text wa prepar from an 1882 edit publish by

i am told that these men the boer ar told to keep on agit in
thi wai for a chang of govern in england mai give them again
the old order of thing noth can show greater ignor of english
polit than such an idea i tell you there is no governmentwhig
or tori liber conserv or radicalwho would dare under ani
circumst to give back thi countri the transvaal thei would not
dare becaus the english peopl would not allow themextract
from speech of sir garnet wolselei deliv at a public banquet in
pretoria on the 17th decemb 1879
there wa a still stronger reason than that for not reced from
the transvaal it wa imposs to sai what calam such a step
as reced might not caus for such a risk he could not make
himself respons difficulti with the zulu and the frontier
tribe would again aris and look as thei must to south africa as
a whole the govern after a care consider of the
question came to the conclus that we could not relinquish the
transvaalextract from speech of lord kimberlei in the hous of
lord 24th mai 1880 h p d vol cclii p 208
introduct
the writer on coloni affair is natur to some extent discourag
by the knowledg that the subject is an unattract on to a larg
proport of the read public it is difficult to get up anyth
beyond a transient interest in the affair of our coloni depend
inde i believ that the mind of the british public wa more
profoundli move by the exodu of jumbo than it would be were on of
them to becom the scene of some startl catastroph thi is the
more curiou inasmuch as put asid all sentiment consider
which inde seem to be out of harmoni with the ag we live in the
trade done even with such compar insignific coloni as our
south african possess amount to a valu of mani million of pound
sterl per annum now as the preacher of the new gospel that hail
from birmingham and northampton have frequent told us trade is
the lifeblood of england and must be foster at ani price it is
therefor surpris that look on them in the light of a commerci
specul in which aspect saith the preacher thei ar alon
worthi of notic a keener interest is not taken in the wellb and
develop of the coloni we have onli to reflect to see how great
ar the advantag that the mother countri deriv from the possess
of her coloni empir includ as thei do a home for her surplu
children a vast and vari market for her product and a wealth of
oldfashion loyalti and deep attach to the old countryhom
as it is alwai calledwhich even if it is out of date might prove
us on emerg it seem therefor almost a piti that some right
honour gentlemen and their follow should adopt the tone thei do
with refer to the coloni after all there is an odd shuffl of
the card go on now in england and great as she is her futur look
by no mean sunni event in these latter dai develop themselv veri
quickli and though the idea mai at the present moment seem absurd
sure it is possibl that what between the rapid spread of radic
idea the enmiti of ireland the import of foreign produc and
the competit of foreign trade to sai noth of all the unforeseen
accid and risk of the futur the englishmen of sai two
gener henc mai not find their countri in her present proud
posit perhap and stranger thing have happen in the histori of
the world she mai by that time be under the protect of those veri
coloni for which their forefath had such small affect
the posit of south africa with refer to the mother countri
is somewhat differ to that of her sister coloni in that she is
regard not so much with apathi ting with dislik as with downright
disgust thi feel ha it foundat in the mani troubl and
expens in which thi countri ha been recent involv through local
complic in the cape zululand and the transvaal and inde is
littl to be wonder at but whilst a larg portion of the press ha
unit with a power parti of politician in direct a continu
stream of abus on to the head of the white inhabit of south
africa whom thei do not scrupl to accus of have creat the recent
disturb in order to reap a monei profit from them it doe not
appear to have struck anybodi that the real root of thi crop of
troubl might after all be grow nearer home the truth of the
matter is that nativ and other problem in south africa have till
quit late been left to take their chanc and solv themselv as
best thei might except when thei have in a casual manner been made
the corpu vile of some polit experi it wa dure thi long
period of inact when each difficultysuch as the nativ question in
natalwa stave off to be dealt with by the next govern that the
seed wa sown of which we ar at present reap the fruit in addit
to thi matter have recent been complic by the elev of
south african affair to the digniti of an english parti question
thu the transvaal annex wa made us of as a warcri in the
last gener elect a boer rebellion wa therebi encourag which
result in a complet revers of our previou polici
now if there is ani countri depend on england that requir the
applic to the conduct of it affair of a firm consid and
consist polici that countri is south africa boer and nativ ar
quit incap of realis the polit necess of ani of
our parti or of understand why their true interest should be
sacrif in order to minist to those necess it is our waver
and uncertain polici as appli to peopl who look upon everi
hesit step as a sign of fear and fail dominion that in
conjunct with previou postpon and neglect ha realli caus
our troubl in south africa for so long as the affair of that
countri ar influenc by amateur and sentimentalist who have no real
interest in it and whose knowledg of it circumst and condit
of life is glean from a few bluebook superfici got up to enabl
the reader to indit theoret articl to the nineteenth centuri
or deliv inaccur speech in the hous of commonsfor so long will
those troubl continu
if i mai ventur to make a suggest the affair of south africa
should be control by a board or council like that which formerli
govern india compos of moder member of both parti with an
admixtur of men possess practic knowledg of the countri i do not
know if ani such arrang would be possibl under our constitut
but the present system of govern by which the control of savag
race fluctuat in obedi of everi variat of english parti
polit is most mischiev in it result
the public howev is somewhat tire of south africa and the reader
mai perhap wonder why he should be troubl with more literatur on
the subject i can assur him that these page ar not written in order
to give me an opportun of air my individu experi or idea
their object is shortly1 to give a true histori of the event
attend on the annex of the transvaal which act ha so
frequent been assign to the most unworthi motiv and ha never
yet been fairli describ by ani on who wa in a posit to know
the fact 2 to throw as much public as possibl on the present
disgrac state of zululand result from our recent settlement in
that countri 3 to show all interest in the kafir race what ha
been the charact of our recent surrend in the transvaal and what
it effect will be on our abandon nativ subject live in that
countri
it mai perhap seem an odd statement consid that i have live
in variou part of south africa for about six year and have perhap
enjoi except advantag in form my opinion when i sai that my
chief fear in publish the present volum is lest my knowledg of my
subject in all it bear should not be realli equal to the task it
is i know the fashion to treat south african difficulti as be
simpl of solut thu it onli took sir garnet wolselei a few week
to understand the whole posit of zulu affair and to execut hi
memor settlement of that countri whilst emin writer appear to
be abl in scamper from durban via kimberlei to cape town in a
postcart to form decid opinion upon everi import question
in south africa the power of thu rapidli assimil intric
knowledg and of see straight through a wall whilst ordinari
individu ar still criticis the brick is no doubt on of the
peculiar privileg of geniuswhich is perhap fortun for south
africarar to the common run of mind howev the difficulti of
form a sound and accur judgment on the interlac problem that
disclos themselv to the student of the polit of southeastern
africa is exceedingli great and the work of year
but although it is by no mean perfect i think that my knowledg of
these problem and of their immin issu is suffici intim
to justifi me in make a prophecynam that unless the nativ and
other question of southeastern africa ar treat with more honest
intellig and on a more settl plan than it ha hitherto been
thought necessari to appli to them the british taxpay will find that
he ha by no mean heard the last of that countri and it war
there is on more point to which although it hardli come within the
scope of thi volum i have made some allus and which i ventur to
suggest deserv the consider of think englishmen i refer to
the question of the desir of allow the dutch in south africa
who ar alreadi numer the strongest to continu to advanc with
such rapid stride toward polit supremaci that the object of
thi parti is to reduc englishmen and english idea to a subordin
posit in the state if not actual to rid itself of our rule and
establish a republ there is no manner of doubt inde there exist
a power organis the africand bond which ha it headquart
in the cape and openli devot it energi to forward these end
by offer a sturdi opposit to the introduct of english emigr
and the us of the english languag whilst strive in everi wai to
excit class prejudic and embitt the alreadi strain relat
between englishman and boer in consid thi question it is as well
not to lose sight of the fact that the dutch ar as a bodi at heart
hostil to our rule chiefli becaus thei cannot toler our lenient
behaviour to the nativ race should thei by ani chanc ceas to be the
subject of england thei will i believ becom her open enemi thi
of itself would be compar unimport were it not for the fact
that in the event of the block of the suez canal it would be to
sai the least inconveni that the cape should be in the hand of a
hostil popul
in conclus i wish to state that thi book is not written for ani
parti purpos i have tri to describ a state of affair which ha for
the most part come under my own observ and event in which i have
been interest and at time engag that the nake truth of such
a busi as the transvaal surrend or of the present condit of
zululand ar unpleas read for an englishman there is no doubt
but so far as these page ar concern thei ow none of their
ugli to undu colour or polit bia

zululand and the zulu settlement still continu to receiv some
attent from the home public partli becaus those respons for the
conduct of affair ar not quit at eas about it and partli becaus of
the agit in thi countri for the restor of cetywayo
there is no doubt that the present state of affair in zululand is a
subject worthi of close consider not onli by those offici
connect with them but by the public at larg nobodi either at
home or in the coloni wish to see anoth zulu war or anyth
approach to it unless howev the affair of zululand receiv a
littl more attent and ar superintend with a littl more human
and intellig than thei ar at present the public will sooner or
later be startl by some fresh catastroph then will follow the usual
outcri and the disturb will be attribut to everi caus under the
sun except the right onew of common precaut
the zulu question is a veri larg on and i onli propos discuss
so much of it as necessari to the proper consider of the propos
restor of cetywayo to hi throne
the king is now come to england where he will doubtless make
a veri good impress sinc hi appear is dignifi and
hi manner as is common among zulu of high rank ar those of
a gentleman it is probabl that hi visit will lead to a popular
agit in hi favour and veri possibl to an attempt on the part
of the english govern to reinstat him in hi kingdom alreadi ladi
florenc dixi wave hi banner and inform the public through the
column of the newspap how good how big and how beauti he is
and f w g x describ in enthusiast term hi pearllik teeth
but as there ar interest involv in the question of hi reinstat
which ar i think more import than cetywayo person proport
of mind or bodi and as the result of such a step would necessarili be
veri mark and farreach it is as well to try and understand the
matter in all it bear befor anyth is done
sinc the abov wa written the govern have at the
last moment decid to postpon cetywayo visit to thi
countri chiefli on account of the polit capit which
wa be made out of the event by agit in zululand
the project of bring the king to england doe not
howev appear to have been abandon
there ha been a great deal of special plead about cetywayo some
writer swai by sentiment and that spirit of partisanship that the
sight of royalti in distress alwai excit whitewash him in such a
persist manner that their reader ar left under the impress that
the exk is a model of injur innoc and virtu other again
for polit reason paint him veri black and predict that
hi restor would result in the destruct or at the least
disorganis of our south african empir the truth in thi as in
the major of polit controversi li somewher between these
two extrem though it is difficult to sai exactli where
to understand the posit of cetywayo both with refer to hi
subject and the english govern it will be necessari to touch
though briefli on the histori of zululand sinc it becam a nation and
also on the princip event of the exk reign
chaka cetywayo great uncl wa the first zulu king and doubtless
on of the most remark men that ha ever fill a throne sinc the
dai of the pharaoh when he came to hi chieftainship about 1813 the
zulu peopl consist of a singl small tribe when hi throne becam
vacant in 1828 their name had becom a live terror and thei were
the greatest black power in south africa the invinc armi of thi
african attila had swept north and south east and west had slaughter
more than a million human be and ad vast tract of countri to
hi dominion wherev hi warrior went the blood of men women and
children wa pour out without stai or stint inde he reign like a
visibl death the presid geniu of a saturnalia of slaughter
hi method of govern and warfar were peculiar and somewhat
drastic but most effect as he conquer a tribe he enrol it
remnant in hi armi so that thei might in their turn help to conquer
other he arm hi regiment with the short stab assegai instead
of the throw assegai which thei had been accustom to us and kept
them subject to an iron disciplin if a man wa observ to show the
slightest hesit about come to close quarter with the enemi
he wa execut as soon as the fight wa over if a regiment had the
misfortun to be defeat whether by it own fault or not it would on
it return to headquart find that a goodli proport of the wive
and children belong to it had been beaten to death by chaka order
and that he wa wait their arriv to complet hi vengeanc by
dash out their brain the result wa that though chaka armi
were occasion annihil thei were rare defeat and thei never
ran awai i will not enter in the histori of hi numer cruelti and
inde thei ar not edifi amongst other thing like nero he kill
hi own mother and then caus sever person to be execut becaus
thei did not show suffici sorrow at her death
at length in 1828 he too suffer the fate he had mete out to so
mani and wa kill by hi brother dingaan and umhlangan by the
hand of on umbopa he wa murder in hi hut and as hi life pass
out of him he is report to have address these word to hi brother
who were watch hi end what do you stab me my brother dog of
mine own hous whom i have fed you hope to be king but though you do
kill me think not that your line shall reign for long i tell you that
i hear the sound of the feet of the great white peopl and that thi
land shall be trodden by them he then expir but hi last word have
alwai been look upon as a propheci by the zulu and inde thei have
been partli fulfil
have in hi turn kill umhlangan hi brother by blood and in crime
dingaan took possess of the throne he wa less pronounc than
chaka in hi foreign polici though he seem to have kept up the famili
reput as regard domest affair it wa he who influenc
perhap by chaka dy propheci about white men massacr retief
the boer leader and hi fifti follow in the most treacher
manner and then fall on the emigr boer in natal murder men
women and children to the number of nearli six hundr there seem
howev to have been but littl love lost between ani of the son of
usengangacona the father of chaka dingaan umhlangan and panda
for in due cours panda hi brother conspir with the boer against
dingaan and overthrew him with their assist dingaan fled and wa
shortli afterward murder in swaziland and panda ascend the throne
in 1840
panda wa a man of differ charact to the remaind of hi race and
seem to have been well content to reign in peac onli kill enough
peopl to keep up hi author two of hi son umbelazi and cetywayo
of whom umbelazi wa the elder and panda favourit began as their
father grew old to quarrel about the success to the crown on the
question be refer to panda he is report to have remark that
when two young cock quarrel the best thing thei could do wa to
fight it out act on thi hint each princ collect hi forc
panda send down on of hi favourit regiment to help umbelazi the
fight took place in 1856 on the bank of the tugela a friend of the
writer happen to be on the natal side of the river the dai befor
the battl and know it wa go to take place swam hi hors
across in the dark take hi chanc of the allig and hid in
some bush on a hillock command the battlefield it wa a hazard
proceed but the sight repaid the risk though he describ it as
veri aw more especi when the regiment of veteran sent by panda
join in the frai it came up at the charg between two and three
thousand strong and wa met near hi hidingplac by on of cetywayo
young regiment the nois of the clash of their shield wa like the
roar of the sea but the old regiment after a struggl in which men
fell thick and fast annihil the other and pass on with thin
rank anoth of cetywayo regiment took the place of the on that
had been destroi and thi time the combat wa fierc and long till
victori again declar for the veteran spear but thei had brought it
dear and were in no posit to continu their charg so the leader
of that brave battalion form it remnant into a ring and like the
scotch at flodden
the stubborn spearmen still made good
the dark impenetr wood
each step where hi comrad stood
the instant that he fell
till there were none left to fall the ground around them wa pile with
dead
but thi gallant charg avail umbelazi but littl and by degre
cetywayo forc press hi men back to the bank of the tugela and
final into it thousand fell upon the field and thousand perish in
the river when my friend swam back that night he had noth to
fear from the allig thei were too well fed umbelazi di on the
battlefield of a broken heart at least it is said that no wound could
be found on hi person he probabl expir in a fit brought on by
anxieti of mind and fatigu a curiou stori is told of cetywayo with
refer to hi brother death after the battl wa over a zulu
from on of hi own regiment present himself befor him with mani
salut sai o princ now canst thou sleep in peac for
umbelazi is dead how knowest thou that he is dead said cetywayo
becaus i slew him with my own hand repli the zulu thou dog
said the princ thou hast dare to lift thy hand against the blood
royal and now thou makest it a matter of boast wast thou not
afraid by chaka head thou shalt have thy reward lead him awai and
the zulu who wa but ly after all have possess himself of
the bracelet off the dead princ bodi wa instantli execut the
probabl is that cetywayo act thu more from motiv of polici than
from affect to hi brother whom inde he hope to destroi it did
not do to make too light of the death of an import princ umbelazi
fate todai might be cetywayo fate tomorrow thi stori bear a
realli remark resembl to that of the young man who slew saul
the lord anoint and suffer death on account thereof at the hand
of david
thi battl is also memor as be the occas of the first public
appear of mr john dunn now the most import chief in zululand
and be it understood the unknown quantiti in all futur transact
in that countri at that time dunn wa a retain of umbelazi and
fought on hi side in the tugela battl after the fight howev
he went over to cetywayo and becam hi man from that time till the
outbreak of the zulu war he remain in zululand as advis to cetywayo
agent for the natal govern and purveyor of firearm to the nation
at larg as soon as cetywayo got into troubl with the imperi
govern dunn like a prudent man desert him and came over to
us in reward sir garnet wolselei advanc him to the most import
chieftainship in zululand which he hope to make a steppingston to
the vacant throne hi advic wa larg follow by sir garnet in
the bestow of the other chieftainship and wa natur not quit
disinterest he ha alreadi publicli announc hi intent of
resist the return of the king hi old master by forc of arm
should the govern attempt to reinstat him
a period of sixteen year elaps befor cetywayo reap the fruit of
the battl of the tugela by succeed to the throne on the death of hi
father panda the onli zulu monarch who ha as yet come to hi end by
natur caus
in 1861 howev cetywayo wa at the instanc of the natal govern
formal nomin heir to the throne by mr shepston it be
thought better that a fix success should be establish with the
concurr of the natal govern than that matter should be left
to take their chanc on panda death mr shepston accomplish hi
mission successfulli though at great person risk for some unknown
reason cetywayo who wa blown up with pride wa at first advers
to be thu nomin and came down to the royal kraal with three
thousand arm follow mean it would see to kill mr shepston
whom he had never befor met panda the old king had an inkl of
what wa to happen but wa powerless to control hi son so he confin
himself to address the assembl multitud in what i have heard sir
theophilu shepston sai wa the most eloqu and touch speech he
ever listen to the subject be the duti of hospit he did
not at the time know how nearli the speech concern him or that it
object wa to preserv hi life thi howev soon becam manifest
when except be taken to some breech of etiquett by on of hi
servant he wa surround by a mob of shout savag whose evid
object wa to put an end to him and those with him for two hour he
remain sit there expect that everi moment would be hi
last but show not the slightest emot till at length he got an
opportun of speak when he rose and said i know that you mean to
kill me it is an easi thing to do but i tell you zulu that for everi
drop of my blood that fall to the ground a hundr men will come
out of the sea yonder from the countri of which natal is on of the
cattlekra and will bitterli aveng me as he spoke he turn
and point toward the ocean and so intens wa the excit that
anim it that the whole great multitud turn with him and stare
toward the horizon as though thei expect to see the long line of
aveng creep across the plain silenc follow hi speech hi
imperturb and hi welltim address had save hi life from
that dai hi name wa a power in the land
a veri good descript of thi scene wa publish in
the london quarterli review in 1878 the follow is an
extract
in the centr of those infuri savag he mr
shepston sat for more than two hour outwardli calm
give confid to hi solitari european companion by hi
own quiet onli onc sai why jem your afraid
and impos restraint on hi nativ attend then when
thei had shout as cetywayo himself said in our hear
till their throat were so sore that thei could shout no
more thei depart but sompseu mr shepston had
conquer cetywayo in describ the scene to us and our
companion on a visit to him a short time afterward said
sompseu is a great man no man but he could have come
through that dai aliv similar testimoni we have had from
some of the zulu assail from the nativ attend and
the companion abov mention next morn cetywayo humbl
beg an interview which wa not grant but on term of
unqualifi submiss from that dai cetywayo ha submit
to british control in the measur in which it ha been
exercis and ha been profus in hi express of
respect and submiss to mr t shepston but in hi
heart as occasion act and speech show he writh
under the restraint and bitterli hate the man who impos
it
it wa on thi occas that a curiou incid occur which
afterward becam of import among the zulu there exist a certain
salut bayet which it is the peculiar and exclus privileg of
zulu royalti to receiv the word mean or is suppos to mean let
us bring tribut on mr shepston visit the point wa rais by the
zulu lawyer as to what salut he should receiv it wa not consist
with their idea that the nomin of their futur king should be
greet with ani salut inferior to the bayet and thi as plain mr
shepston it wa imposs to give him the difficulti wa obviou
but the zulu mind prove equal to it he wa solemnli announc to be
a zulu king and to stand in the place of the great founder of their
nation chaka who wa so fit to proclaim the successor to the throne
as the great predecessor of the princ proclaim to us thi seem a
strang not to sai ludicr wai of settl a difficulti but there
wa noth in it repugn to zulu idea odd as it wa it invest
mr shepston with all the attribut of a zulu king such as the power
to make law order execut c and those attribut in the ey of
zulu he still retain
in 1873 messeng came down from zululand to the natal govern
bring with them the king head that is a complimentari present
of oxen announc the death of panda the nation thei said wa
wander it wander and wander and wander again the spirit of
the king had depart from them hi word had ceas and none
but children were left the messag end with a request that mr
shepston as cetywayo father should come and instal him on the
throne a month or two afterward there came anoth messag again
request hi attend and on the request be refus by the
lieutenantgovernor of natal there came a third messag to which the
natal govern return a favour answer
accordingli mr shepston proceed to zululand and on the 3rd
septemb 1873 proclaim cetywayo king with all due pomp and ceremoni
it wa on thi occas that in the presenc of and with the
enthusiast assent of both king and peopl mr shepston stand
in the place of cetywayo father and so repres the nation
enunci the four follow articl with a view to put an end to
the continu slaughter that darken the histori of zululand
1 that the indiscrimin shed of blood shall ceas in the land
2 that no zulu shall be condemn without open trial and the public
examin of wit for and against and that he shall have a right
to appeal to the king
3 that no zulu life shall be taken without the previou knowledg and
consent of the king after such trial ha taken place and the right of
appeal ha been allow to be exercis
4 that for minor crime the loss of properti all or a portion shall
be substitut for the punish of death
nobodi will deni that these were admir regul and that thei
were receiv as such at the time by the zulu king and peopl but there
is no doubt that their readi accept by the king wa a sacrific to
hi desir to pleas hi father sompseu mr shepston and the natal
govern with both of which he wa particularli anxiou to be on
good term he ha never adher to these coron regul or
promis as thei have been call and the probabl is that he
never intend to adher to them howev thi mai be i must sai that
person i have been unabl to share the view of those who see in
the breach of these socal promis a justif of the zulu war
after all what do thei amount to and what guarante wa there for
their fulfil thei mere repres a veri laudabl attempt on the
part of the natal govern to keep a restrain hand on zulu cruelti
and to draw the bond of friendship as tight as the idiosyncrasi of
a savag state would allow the govern of natal had no right to
dictat the term to a zulu king on which he wa to hold hi throne the
zulu nation wa an independ nation and had never been conquer or
annex by natal if the govern of that coloni wa abl by friendli
negoti to put a stop to zulu slaughter it wa a matter for
congratul on humanitarian ground but it is difficult to follow
the argument that becaus it wa not abl or wa onli partial abl
to do so therefor england wa justifi in make war on the zulu
on the other hand it is perfectli ludicr to observ the wai in which
cetywayo advoc overshoot the mark in argu thi and similar
point especi hi ladi advoc whose write upon these
subject bear about the same resembl to the truth that the speech to
the juri by the counsel for the defenc in a hopeless murder case doe
to the sum up of the judg have demonstr that the engag
enter into by cetywayo meant noth thei will proce to show that
even if thei did coldblood murder when perpetr by a black
paragon like cetywayo doe not amount to a great offenc in the mouth
of these gentl apologist for slaughter massacr masquerad under the
name of execut and is excus on the plea of be after all
onli the enforc of an old custom again the employ of
such phrase in a solemn answer to a remonstr from the
lieutenantgovernor of natal as i do kill but do not consid that
i have done anyth yet in the wai of kill i have not yet
begun i have yet to kill ar shown to mean noth at all and to be
noth more than the mere irrit of the moment perhap those
of cetywayo subject who suffer on account of thi mere momentari
irrit took a more seriou view of it it is but fair to the
particular author from whom i quot miss colenso histori of the
zulu war pp 230231 to state that she consid thi repli from
the usual courteou and respect king as no doubt petul and
want in due respect consid that the messag in question which
can be read in the footnot wa a pointblank defianc of sir henri
bulwer admit that there had been slaughter but that it wa noth
compar to what wa come most peopl will not think miss colenso
descript of it too strong
the follow is the text of the messag
did i ever tell mr shepston i would not kill did he tell
the white peopl that i made such an arrang becaus if
he did he ha deceiv them i do kill but do not consid
that i have done anyth yet in the wai of kill why do
the white peopl start at noth i have not yet begun i
have yet to kill it is the custom of our nation and i
shall not depart from it why doe the governor of natal
speak to me about my law do i go to natal and dictat to
him about hi law i shall not agre to ani law or rule
from natal and by do so throw the larg kraal which i
govern into the water my peopl will not listen unless thei
ar kill and while wish to be friend with the
english i do not agre to give my peopl over to be
govern by law sent to me by them have i not ask the
english to allow me to wash my spear sinc the death of my
father umpandi and thei have kept plai with me all
thi time treat me like a child go back and tell the
english that i shall now act on my own account and if thei
wish me to agre to their law i shall leav and becom a
wander but befor i go it will be seen as i shall not go
without have act go back and tell the white men thi
and let them hear it well the governor of natal and i ar
equal he is governor of natal and i am governor here
to admit that the zulu king ha the right to kill as mani of hi
subject as he choos so long as thei will toler be kill is
on thing but it is certainli surpris to find educ european
adopt a line of defenc of these proceed on hi behalf that
amount to a virtual express of approv or at least of easi
toler ha philanthropi a deaden effect on the moral sens that
the peopl who constitut themselv champion for the unfortun zulu
king and the oppress boer cannot get on to their hobbi without
becom blind to the differ between right and wrong realli an
examin of the utter of these champion of oppress innoc
would almost lead on to that conclus on the on hand thei suppress
and explain awai fact and on the other suppli their want of argument
by reckless accus and viciou attack on the probiti of such
of their fellowenglishmen especi if in offic as have had the
misfortun to pursu a cours of action or to express opinion not
pleas to them or their proteg for instanc an innoc and
unenlighten reader of the veri interest work from which i have just
quot probabl lai it down with the convict that both sir bartl
frere and sir theophilu shepston ar veri wick men and full of bad
motiv and will wonder how a civilis govern could emploi such
monster of bloodthirsti duplic as he proce he will also find
that there is not much to be said for the charact of either sir
garnet wolselei or lord chelmsford whilst as regard such small fry as
mr john shepston the present secretari of nativ affair in natal
after pass through miss colenso mill their reput come out
liter in rag and tatter he will be shock to find that not onli
did on and all of these gentlemen make gross error of judgment but
trust and distinguish servant of their countri as thei ar thei
were on and all actuat by dark person motiv that will not bear
examin
heaven help the member of the shepston famili when thei fall into the
hand of the gentler but more enthusiast sex for miss colenso is not
their onli foe in a recent public call a defenc of zululand
and it king ladi florenc dixi gibbet mr henriqu shepston and
point him out to be execr by a cetywayoworship public becaus
the exk is to be sent to england in hi charg when accord to
ladi dixi he will certainli be scoundrel enough to misinterpret all
that cetywayo sai for hi own end and will therebi inflict a
cruel wrong upon him and render hi visit to england perfectli
meaningless perhap it ha never occur to ladi dixi that thi is a
veri seriou charg to bring against an honour man whose reput
is probabl as dear to him as the advanc of cetywayo caus is to
her it is all veri well to be enthusiast but ladi should rememb
that there ar other peopl in the world to be consid besid
cetywayo
as regard the question of cetywayo bloodthirsti which is so
strenuous deni by hi apologist i cannot sai that a care
studi of the blue book bear on the subject bring me to the same
conclus it is true that there is not much inform on the point
for the obviou reason that the histori of slaughter in zululand in the
vast major of case onli reach natal in the form of rumour
which nobodi thought it worth while to report there were no newspap
correspond in zululand there is not howev ani doubt that
cetywayo wa in the habit of kill larg number of peopl inde it
wa a matter of the commonest notorieti nor as will be seen from the
messag i have transcrib did he himself deni it when be angri
he spoke the truth at the same time that thi messag wa sent we
find mr osborn then resid magistr at newcastl in natal who is
certainli not given to exagger write to the secretari for nativ
affair thusfrom all i have been abl to learn cetywayo conduct
ha been and continu to be disgrac he is put peopl to
death in a shame manner especi girl the dead bodi ar
place by hi order in the princip path especi where the path
intersect each other cross road a few of the parent of the young
peopl so kill buri the bodi and thu brought cetywayo wrath
on themselv result not onli on their own death but destruct
of the whole famili it is realli terribl that such horribl
savageri could take place on our own border uhamu reprov
cetywayo the other dai remind him of hi promis to mr shepston
and beg him to spare the peopl thi advic as could be expect
wa not relish
again mr fynnei in hi report of hi visit to zululand in 1877
state that though the king and hi induna councillor deni that
men were kill without trial the peopl told a veri differ
tale thu he sai in everi instanc where i had so far gain the
confid of the zulu as to caus them to speak freeli wa i assur
of the truth of the statement that the king cetywayo caus hi
peopl to be put to death in great number and when i remark that of
cours he did so after a fair and proper trial in some case my remark
wa greet with a suppress laugh or a smile some remark ye
a trial of bullet other ye we get a trial but that mean
surround the kraal at daybreak and shoot us down like cattl
on ask me what the govern in natal intend do or what wa
thought in natal about the kill sai it wa not in the night
that sompseu spoke but in the sunshin the king wa not alon but hi
peopl were around him and the ear of all zululand heard these word
and the heart of all zulu were joy and in glad thei lift up
their hand sai the mouth of our white father ha spoken good word
he ha caution hi child in the presenc of hi peopl and a good sun
ha risen thi dai over zululand how is it now ha the king listen
doe he hold fast those word no not on the promis he made ar
all broken what doe sompseu sai to thi you should dine at my kraal
yonder for a few dai and see the izizi cattl and other properti of
peopl who have been kill pass and you would then see with your own
ey how a case is tri farther on mr fynnei sai when a charg
is made against a zulu the question is gener ask ha he ani
cattl and if answer in the affirm there is littl chanc of
escap instanc of kill occur while i wa in zululand and to
my knowledg no trial wa allow an arm parti wa despatch on the
morn i left ondin and as i wa inform to kill
there is no reason to suppos that mr fynnei wa in ani wai prejud
in make these remark on the contrari he wa simpli carri out
an offici mission and report for the gener inform of the
govern of natal and the transvaal it is howev notic that
neither these nor similar passag ar ever allud to by cetywayo
advoc whose object seem to be rather to suppress the truth than to
put it fairli befor the public if by such suppress thei think thei
can advanc the caus of the exk
the whole matter of cetywayo privat polici howev appear to me
to be veri much besid the question whether or no he slaughter hi
oppress subject in bygon year which there is no doubt he did is
not our affair sinc we were not then as we ar now respons for
the good govern of zululand and see the amount of slaughter
that goe on under our protector it ill becom us to rake up these
thing against cetywayo what we have to consid is hi foreign polici
not the domest detail of hi govern
a gentleman who ha recent return from travel
in zululand relat the follow stori as nearli as
possibl in the word in which it wa told to him by a well
known hunter in zululand piet hogg by name now resid
near dunde on the zulu border the stori is a curiou on
as illustr of zulu charact and scarc repres
cetywayo in as amiabl a light as on might wish piet hogg
and my inform were on dai talk about the king when
the former said i wa hunt and trade in zululand and
wa at a militari kraal occupi by cetywayo where i saw a
basuto who had been engag by the king to instruct hi
peopl in build hous that were to be squar instead
of circular as ar all zulu build for which hi pai
wa to be thirti head of cattl the basuto came to cetywayo
in my presenc and said that the squar build were
made he now wish to have hi thirti head of cattl and to
depart cetywayo have obtain what he requir began to
think the man overpaid so said i have observ that you
like a zulu woman belong to the kraal suppos you
take her instead of the thirti head of cattl now thi wa
a veri bad bargain for the basuto as the woman wa not
worth more in zulu estim than ten head of cattl but
the basuto know with whom he had to deal thought it
might be better to compli with the suggest rather than
insist upon hi right and ask to be allow till the
next morn to consid the propos after he had been
dismiss on thi understand cetywayo sent for the
woman and accus her of misconduct with the basuto the
punish of which if prove would be death she deni
thi vehement with protest and tear he insist
but look up at a tree almost denud of leav which
grew close by said significantli take care that not a
leaf remain on that tree by the morn the woman
understood the metaphor and in an hour or two aid by
other strap zulu femal attack the unfortun
basuto and kill him with club but cetywayo have thu
like the monkei in the fabl emploi a cat paw to do hi
dirti work began to think the basuto untim death might
have an ugli appear in my ey so gave order in my
presenc that as a punish six of the women who had
kill the basuto should also be put to death thi wa too
much for me know as i did all that had pass i
reproach cetywayo for hi cruelti and declar i would
leav zululand without trade there and without make him
the present he expect i also said i should take care the
great english inkos the governor of natal should hear
of hi conduct and the reason of my return cetywayo wa
then on friendli term with the english and be impress
by my threat he reconsid hi order and spare the
live of the women
i do not propos to follow out all the detail of the boundari disput
between cetywayo and the transvaal or to comment on the differ
opinion held on the point by the variou author english and
zulu the question ha been for the moment settl by the transvaal
convent and is besid a most uninterest on to the gener
reader
nor shall i enter into a discuss concern the outrag on which
sir bartl frere base hi ultimatum previou to the zulu war thei were
after all insignific although suffici to serv as a casu belli
to a statesman determin to fight the zulu war wa in the opinion of
sir b frere necessari in selfdef which is the first principl of
exist if it admit of justif it is on the ground that the
zulu armi wa a menac to the white popul of south africa and that
it wa therefor necessari to destroi it lest at some futur time it
should destroi the white it is ridicul to sai that the captur of
two zulu women in natal and their subsequ murder or the expuls on
polit ground of a few missionari justifi us in break up a
kingdom and slaughter ten thousand men sir bartl frere declar war
upon the zulu becaus he wa afraid and had good reason to be
afraid that if he did not cetywayo would befor long sweep either
the transvaal or natal whilst on the other hand the zulu fought us
becaus our polici wa too philanthrop to allow them to fight anybodi
els thi statement mai appear strang but a littl examin into
zulu charact and circumst will i think show it to be correct
it must be rememb that for some year befor panda death the zulu
had not been engag in ani foreign war when cetywayo ascend the
throne it wa the gener hope and expect of the armi and
therefor of the nation that thi period of inact would come to an
end and that the new king would inaugur an activ foreign polici
thei did not greatli care in what direct the activ develop
itself provid it did develop it must also be born in mind that
everi ablebodi man in the zulu countri wa a member of a regiment
even the lad be attach to regiment as carrier and the women
be similarli enrol though thei did not fight the zulu militari
system wa the universalservic system of germani brought to an
absolut perfect obtain by subordin all the ti and duti
of civil life to militari end thu for instanc marriag could not
be contract at will but onli by the permiss of the king which wa
gener delai until a regiment wa well advanc in year when a
number of girl were hand over to it to take to wife thi regul
came into forc becaus it wa found that men without home ti were
more feroci and made better soldier and the result of these harsh
rule wa that the zulu warrior live as he did under the shadow of a
savag disciplin for ani breach of which there wa but on punish
death can hardli be said to have led a life of domest comfort such
as men of all time and nation have thought their common right but
even a zulu must have some object in life some shrine at which to
worship some mistress of hi affect home he had none religion he
had none mistress he had none but in their stead he had hi career
as a warrior and hi hope of honour and rich to be gain by the
assegai hi home wa on the wartrack with hi regiment hi religion
the fierc denunci of the isanusi and hi affect were fix
on the sudden rush of battl the red slaughter and the spoil of
the slain war sai sir t shepston in a veri remark despatch
written about a year befor the outbreak of the zulu war is the
univers cry among the soldier who ar anxiou to live up to their
tradit and the idea is gain ground among the peopl that
their nation ha outliv the object of it exist again he sai
the engin the zulu militari organis ha not ceas to exist or
to gener it forc although the reason or excus for it exist
ha di awai these forc have continu to accumul and ar daili
accumul without safetyvalv or outlet
witchdoctor these person ar larg emploi in
zululand to smell out witch who ar suppos to have
bewitch other and ar of cours veri us as polit
agent ani person denounc by them is at onc execut a
friend of the writer wa onc present at a polit
smellingout on a larg scale and describ it as a veri
curiou and unpleas scene the men of whom there were
some thousand were seat in a circl as pale with terror
as zulu can be within the circl were sever witch
doctor on of whom amidst hi or her incant would
now and again step forward and touch some unfortun man
with a fork stick the victim wa instantli led awai a few
pace and hi neck twist the circl await each
denunci in breathless expect for not a man among
them knew whose turn it might be next on anoth occas
an unfortun wretch who had been similarli condemn by an
isanusi rush up to the same gentleman waggon and
besought shelter he wa hidden under some blanket but
present hi pursuer arriv and insist upon hi be
hand over all possibl resist wa made until the
execution announc that thei would search the waggon and
kill him there it wa then coven that he should have a
start in the race for life he wa howev overtaken and
kill these instanc will show how dark and terribl is
the zulu superstit connect with witchcraft and what a
formid weapon it becom in the hand of the king or
chief
desir as such a state of feel mai be in an armi just leav
for the battlefield it is obviou that for some fifti thousand men
compris the whole manhood of the nation to be continu on the
boil with sanguinari animos against the human race in gener is an
awkward element to fit into the peaceabl govern of a state
yet thi wa doubtless the state of affair with which cetywayo had
to contend dure the latter year of hi reign he found himself
surround by a great armi in a high state of effici and warlik
prepar proclaim itself weari with camp life and clamour
to be led against an enemi that it might justifi it tradit and
find employ for it spear often and often he must have been sore
puzzl to find excus wherewith to put it off inde hi posit
wa both awkward and danger on the on hand wa scylla in the shape
of the english govern and on the other the stormi and uncertain
charybdi of hi clamour regiment slowli the idea must have began
to dawn upon him that unless he found employ for the armi which
besid be disgust with hi inact wa somewhat weari with
hi cruelti for domest slaughter had ceas to divert and had begun
to irrit the armi or some enterpris member of it might put it
beyond hi power ever to find employ for it at all and bring on of
hi brother to rule in hi stead
and yet who wa he to fight if fight he must there were three possibl
enemies1 the swazi 2 the transvaal boer 3 the english
although the english mai have held a place on cetywayo list as
possibl foe there is no ground for suppos that until shortli
befor the war he had ani wish to fight with us inde wherea their
hatr of the boer wa pronounc and openli express both the zulu
king and peopl alwai profess great respect for englishmen and even
a certain amount of like and regard
therefor when cetywayo had to settl on an enemi to attack it wa not
the english that he chose but the swazi whose territori adjoin hi
own ly along the border of the transvaal toward delagoa bai the
swazi ar themselv zulu and cetywayo claim certain sovereign
right over them which howev thei refus to recognis thei ar a
power tribe and can turn out about 10000 fight men quit enough
for cetywayo young warrior to try their mettl on still the king
doe not appear to have wish to undertak the war without first
obtain the approv of the natal govern to whom he appli
sever time for permiss to wash hi spear sai that he wa
but half a king until he had done so the natal govern howev
invari repli that he wa on no account to do anyth of the sort
thi show the inconveni of possess a complimentari feudal hold
over a savag potent the shadow of power without the realiti the
governor of natal could not in decenc sanction such a proceed as a
war of extermin against the swazi but if it had occur without
hi sanction the swazi would have suffer no doubt but the zulu
spear would have been satisfactorili wash and there would have been
no zulu war as it is englishmen have been kill instead of swazi
thwart in hi design on the swazi cetywayo next turn hi
attent to the transvaal boer the zulu and the boer had never been
good friend sinc the dai of the massacr of retief and of late
year their mutual animos had been greatli increas ow to
their quarrel about the boundari question previous allud to thi
animos reach bloodheat when the boer govern act with the
arrog it alwai displai toward nativ began to lai it command
upon cetywayo about hi relat with the amaswazi the alleg
trespass on boer territori and other matter the arrog wa
all the more offens becaus it wa impot the boer were not in
a posit to undertak the chastis of the zulu but the king and
council of zululand now determin to try conclus with the transvaal
on the first conveni opportun and thi time without consult
the govern of natal the opportun soon occur secocoeni the
power chief of the bapedi on of the tribe whose territori border
on the transvaal came to a differ with the boer over anoth
border question there is good ground for suppos that cetywayo
incit him to withstand the boer demand it is certain that dure the
cours of the war that follow he assist him with advic and more
substanti still with zulu volunt
to be brief the secocoeni war result in the discomfitur of the
transvaal forc anoth result of thi struggl wa to throw the whole
state into the most utter confus of which the dutch burgher alwai
glad of an opportun to defi the law took advantag to refus to pai
tax nation bankruptci ensu and confus grew wors confound
cetywayo took note of all thi and saw that now wa hi opportun to
attack the boer had suffer both in moral and prestig from their
defeat by secocoeni who wa still in arm against them whilst the
nativ were proportion elat by their success over the dread
white men there wa he knew well but littl chanc of a rapid
concentr to resist a sudden raid especi when made by such a
power armi or rather chain of armi as he could set in motion
everyth favour the undertak inde humanli speak it
is difficult to see what could have save the greater part of the
popul of the transvaal from sudden extinct if a kind provid
had not just then put it into the head of lord carnarvon to send out
sir t shepston as special commission to their countri when cetywayo
heard that hi father sompseu sir t shepston wa go up to the
transvaal he held hi hand sent out spi and await the cours
of event the follow incid will show with what interest he wa
watch what took place at the vaal river a parti of boer met
the special commission and fire salut to welcom him it wa
immedi report to cetywayo by hi spi that the boer had fire
over sir t shepston waggon shortli afterward a messag arriv at
pretoria from cetywayo to inquir into the truth of the stori coolli
announc hi intent of sweep the transvaal if it were true that
hi father had been fire at in a convers with mr fynnei after
the annex cetywayo allud to hi intent in these word
i heard that the boer were not treat him sompseu properli and
that thei intend to put him in a corner if thei had done so i should
not have wait for anyth more had but on shot been fire
i should have said what more do i wait for thei have touch my
father i should have pour my men over the land and i can tell you
son of mr fynnei the land would have burn with fire thi will show
how eagerli cetywayo wa search for an excus to commenc hi attack
on the transvaal when the hope of find a pretext in the suppos
fire at sir t shepston or ani incid of a similar natur fade
awai he appear to have determin to carri out hi plan without
ani immedi pretext and to make a casu belli of hi previou
differ with the govern of the republ accordingli he mass
hi impi armi corp at differ point along the transvaal border
where thei await the signal to advanc and sweep the countri
inform of cetywayo do and of hi secret plan reach
pretoria shortli befor the annex and confirm the mind of the
special commission as to the absolut necess of that measur to
save the citizen of the republ from come to a violent end
and south africa from be plung into a nativ war of unexampl
magnitud the dai befor the annex took place when it wa quit
certain that it would take place a messag wa sent to cetywayo by sir
t shepston tell him of what wa about to happen and tell
him too in the sternest and most straightforward languag that the
transvaal had becom the queen land like natal and that he must no
more think of attack it than he would of attack natal cetywayo
on receiv the messag at onc disband hi armi and sent them
to their kraal kabuna he said to the messeng my impi were
gather now at my father sir t shepston bid i send them
back to their home
thi fact name that at the bid of hi old mentor sir t
shepston cetywayo abandon hi longcherish plan and hi
undoubt opportun of pai off old score with the boer in a most
effectu manner and gave up a polici that had so mani charm for him
must be held by everi unprejud man to speak volum in hi favour
it must be rememb that it wa not mere to oblig hi father
sompseu that he did thi but to meet the wish of the english
govern and the act show how anxiou he wa to retain the
friendship and fall in with the view of that govern evid
cetywayo had no animos against us in april 1877
in hi interview with mr fynnei cetywayo speak out quit frankli as
to what hi intent had been he sai i know all about the soldier
be on their wai up but i would have ask sompseu to allow the
soldier to stand on on side for just a littl while onli a littl
and see what my men could do it would have been unnecessari for the
queen peopl to troubl my men were all readi and how big must that
stone have been with my father sompseu dig at on side and myself
at the other that would not have toppl over even though the size
of that mountain point to a mountain rang we could put it on it
back again i sai i am glad to know the transvaal is english ground
perhap now there mai be rest
thi and other passag show beyond all doubt from what an aw
catastroph the transvaal wa save by the annex that cetywayo
person detest the boer is made clear by hi word to mr fynnei
the boer he sai ar a nation of liar thei ar a bad peopl
bad altogeth i do not want them near my peopl thei lie and claim
what is not their and illus my peopl where is thoma presid
burger i inform him that mr burger had left the transvaal then
let them pack up and follow thoma said he let them go the queen
doe not want such peopl as those about her land what can the queen
make of them or do with them their evil wai puzzl both thoma and
rudolph landdrost of utrecht thei will not be quiet
it is veri clear that if cetywayo had been left to work hi will a
great mani of the boer would have found it necessari to pack up and
follow thoma whilst mani more would have never need to pack again
i am awar that attempt have been made to put anoth explan on
cetywayo warlik prepar against the boer it ha been said that
the zulu armi wa call up by sir t shepston to coerc the transvaal
it is satisfactori to be abl from intim person knowledg to
give unqualifi denial to that statement which is a pure invent as
inde is easili prove by clear evid which i have enter into in
anoth part of thi book cetywayo plai for hi own hand all along
and receiv neither command nor hint from the special commission to
get hi armi togeth inde when sir t shepston discov what wa
go on he suffer great anxieti lest some catastroph should
occur befor he wa in a posit to prevent it noth short of
the annex could have save the transvaal at that moment and the
conduct of the boer after the danger had been taken on to the
shoulder of the imperi govern is a startl instanc of nation
ingratitud
here again the zulu king wa brought face to face with the ubiquit
british govern and that too at a particularli aggrav moment
he wa about to commenc hi attack when he wa met with a polit
hand off thi is british territori no wonder that we find him in
despair renew hi prayer that sompseu will allow him to make on
littl raid onli on small swoop and sai that it is the custom
of our countri when a new king is place over the nation to wash
their spear and it ha been done in the case of all former king of
zululand i am no king but sit in a heap i cannot be a king till i
have wash my assegai all of which is doubtless veri savag and
veri wrong but such is the deprav of human natur that there is
someth take about it for all that
it wa at thi period of the histori of south africa that mani peopl
think we made our crown mistak we annex the transvaal sai thei
six month too soon as thing have turn out it would have been wiser
to have left zulu and transvaal boer to try conclus and done
our best to guard our own frontier there is no doubt that such a
consumm of affair would have clear the polit atmospher
wonderfulli the zulu would have got enough fight to last them some
time and the remaind of the boer would have entreat our protect
and becom content british subject there would have been no
isandhlwana and no majuba hill but to these i sai who could forese the
futur and who in the then state of kindli feel toward the boer
could wish to leav them and all the english mix up with them to
undergo unprepar as thei were the terribl experi of a zulu
invas besid what guarante wa there that the slaughter would
stop in the transvaal or that the combat would not have develop into
a war of race throughout south africa even look at the matter in
the light of after event it is difficult to regret that human
wa on thi occas allow to take preced of a more coldblood
polici if the oppon of the annex or even the member of the
transvaal independ committe knew what a zulu invas meant thei
would scarc have been so bitter about that act
from the time of the annex it wa a mere matter of opinion as to
which direct the zulu explos would take the safetyvalv were
load whilst the pressur daili increas and all acquaint with the
peopl knew that it must come sooner or later
shortli after the transvaal becam british territori the old zulu
boundari question came to the fore again and wa made more complic
than ever by sir t shepston who had hitherto favour the zulu
claim take the boer side of the controversi after examin of
the local and of person acquaint with the detail of the matter
there wa noth wonder in thi chang of opinion though of cours
it wa attribut to variou motiv by advoc of the zulu claim
and there is no doubt that cetywayo himself did not at all like it and
excit thereto by vexat and the outcri of hi regiment adopt
a veri differ and aggress tone in hi commun with the
english author inde hi irrit against the boer and
everybodi connect with them wa veri great probabl if he had been
left alon he would in time have carri out hi old programm and
attack the transvaal but fortun for the transvaal which like
sailor and drunken men alwai seem to have had a special provid
take care of it at thi junctur sir bartl frere appear upon the
scene and after a few preliminari and the present of a strong
ultimatum which wa quit impractic so far as cetywayo wa
concern sinc it demand what it wa almost imposs for him to
concedeth disband of hi armyinvad zululand
it is gener suppos that the natal colonist had a great deal to
do with make the zulu war but thi is not the case it is quit true
that thei were rejoic at the prospect of the breakup of cetywayo
power becaus thei were veri much afraid of him and of hi celib
manslai machin which under all the circumst is not
wonder but the war wa a distinctli imperi war made by an
imperi offic without consult with coloni author on
imperi ground viz becaus cetywayo menac her majesti power in
south africa of cours if there had been no coloni there would have
been no war but in that wai onli ar thei respons for it natal
howev ha not grudg to pai 250000 pound toward it expens
which is a great deal more than it can afford and consid that the
foolish settlement made by sir garnet wolselei is almost sure to involv
the coloni in troubl quit as much as should be ask
the fact of the matter wa that sir bartl frere wa a statesman who
had the courag of hi convict he saw that a zulu disturb of
on kind or anoth wa inevit so he boldli took the initi if
thing had gone right with him as he suppos thei would prais would
have been lavish on him by the home author and he would have
been made a peer and perhap governorgener of india to boot but he
reckon without hi lord chelmsford and the element of success which
wa necessari to gild hi polici in the ey of the home public wa
conspicu by it absenc as it wa no languag wa consid to
be too bad to appli to thi imperi proconsul who had taken upon
himself to declar a war if it is ani consol to him he ha at ani
rate the gratitud of the south african coloni not so much for what
he ha done for that is be carefulli nullifi by the subsequ
action of the home govern but becaus believ hi polici to be
right he had the bold to carri it out at the risk of hi offici
reput sir bartl frere took a larger view of the duti of the
governor of a great depend than to constitut himself the flicker
shadow of the secretari of state in down street who know littl
of the real interest of the coloni is himself onli the reflect
of those that hold the balanc of power to whom the subject is on of
entir indiffer provid that there is noth to pai
the detail of the zulu war ar matter of melancholi histori which
it is useless to recapitul here with the except of the affair at
rork drift there is noth to be proud of in connect with it
and a great deal to be asham of more especi it final settlement
there is howev on point that i wish to submit to the consider
of my reader and that is that cetywayo wa never thoroughli in
earnest about the war if he had been in earnest if he had been
determin to put out hi full strength he would certainli have swept
natal from end to end after hi victori at isandhlwana there wa no
forc to prevent hi do so on the contrari it is probabl that if
he had advanc a strong armi over the border a great number of the
natal nativ would have declar in hi favour through fear of hi
vengeanc or at the least would have remain neutral he had ampl
time at hi dispos to have execut the manoeuvr twice over befor
the arriv of the reinforc of which the result must have been
veri dread and yet he never destroi a singl famili the reason he
ha himself given for thi conduct is that he did not wish to irrit
the white man that he had not made the war and wa onli anxiou to
defend hi countri
when the fight came to an end after the battl of ulundi there
were two appar cours open to us to take on wa to take over
the countri and rule it for the benefit of the zulu and the other to
enforc the demand in sir bartl frere ultimatum and take such
guarante as circumst would admit of leav cetywayo on the
throne instead of act on either of these plan howev sir garnet
wolselei proceed in the face of an extraordinari consensu of advers
opinion which he treat with calm contempt to execut what ha prove
to be a veri cruel settlement sir garnet wolselei ha the reput of
be an extrem abl man and it is onli fair to him to suppos that
he wa not the sole parent of thi polit monster by which all the
blood and treasur expend on the zulu war were made of no account but
that it wa partial dictat to him by author at home who were
anxiou to gratifi english opinion and partli ignor partli
careless of the consequ at the same time it is clear that he is
respons for the detail of the scheme sinc immedi after the
captur of cetywayo he write a despatch about them which wa consid
so import that a member of hi staff wa sent to england in
charg of it in thi document he inform the secretari of state that
cetywayo rule wa resolut built up without ani of the ordinari and
law foundat of author and by the mere vigour and vital of
an individu charact it is difficult to understand what sir garnet
mean in thi passag if the fact of be the right and gener
accept occup of the throne is not an ordinari and law
foundat of author what is as regard cetywayo have built up
hi rule by the mere vigour and vital of an individu charact
he is sure in error cetywayo posit wa not differ to that
of hi immedi predecessor if sir garnet had appli the remark to
chaka the first king to the vigour and vital of whose individu
charact zululand ow it exist as a nation it would have been
more appropri the despatch goe on to announc that he ha made
up hi mind to divid the countri into thirteen portion in order to
prevent the possibl of ani reunion of it inhabit under on
rule and end in these word i have labour with the great aim of
establish for her majesti subject in south africa both white and
colour as well as for thi spirit peopl against whom unhappili we
have been involv in war the endur foundat of peac happi
and prosper the spirit peopl were no doubt vastli thank but
the white man read such a passag as thi and know the fact of
the case will onli recognis sir garnet wolselei admir talent for
iron write
sir garnet enter into an agreement with each of hi kinglet who
amongst other thing promis that thei would not make war without
the sanction of the british govern he also issu a paper of
instruct to the gentleman who wa first appoint british resid
who by the wai veri soon threw up hi post in despair from thi
document we learn that all the exk brother ar to be under
the ey of the chief john dunn but it is chiefli remark for the
hostil it evinc to all missionari enterpris the resid is
instruct to be care to hold yourself entir aloof from all
missionari or proselytis enterpris and that grant of land
by former king to missionari cannot be recognis by the british
govern although sir garnet will allow missionari to live in the
countri if the chief of the district doe not object these instruct
creat some advers comment in england with the result that in
the supplementari instruct issu on the occas of mr osborn
appoint as resid thei were somewhat modifi in the despatch
to the secretari of state in which he announc the new appoint sir
garnet sai that mr osborn is to be the councillor guid and friend
of the nativ chief and that to hi moral influenc we should
look i think for the spread of civilis and the propag of the
gospel what a conglomer of dutiesat onc prophet priest and
king poor mr osborn
of the chief appoint under thi unfortun settlement some were
so carelessli chosen that thei have no author whatsoev over
the district to which thei were appoint their nomin subject
prefer to remain under the leadership of their hereditari chief
sever of sir garnet littl king cannot turn out an hundr men
whilst the hereditari chief who ha no offici author can bring up
three or four thousand thu for instanc a territori wa given to
a chief call infaneulela the retain of thi gentleman live in a
kraal of five or six hut on the battlefield of ulundi a chief call
dilligan to whom the district should have been given is practic
head man of the district and take everi possibl opportun of
defi the nomine chief infaneulela who is not acknowledg by
the peopl anoth case is that of umgitchwa to whom a territori wa
given in thi instanc there ar two brother umgitchwa and somhlolo
born of differ mother umgitchwa is the elder but somhlolo is the
son of a daughter of the king and therefor accord to zulu custom
entitl to succe to the chieftainship somhlolo wa disinherit by
sir garnet on account of hi youth he is about twentyf and ha mani
wive but an ancient custom is not to be thu abrog by a stroke of
the pen and somhlolo is practic chief of the district fight is
immin between the two brother
a third case is that of hlubi who though be a good wellmean
man is a basuto and be a foreign ha no influenc over the zulu
under him
a fourth instanc is that of umlandela an old and infirm zulu who wa
made chief over a larg proport of the umtetwa tribe on the coast of
zululand hi appoint wa a fatal mistak and ha alreadi led to
much bloodsh under the follow curiou circumst which ar not
without interest as show the intricaci of zulu plot
the umtetwa were in the dai of chaka a veri power tribe but
suffer the same fate at hi hand as did everi other that ventur to
cross spear with him thei were partial annihil and whilst some
of the survivor of whom the umtetwa in zululand ar the descend
were embodi in the zulu regiment other were scatter far and wide
branch of thi import tribe exist as far off as the cape coloni
dingiswayo who wa the chief of the umtetwa when chaka conquer the
tribe fled after hi defeat into basutoland and is suppos to have
di there after the zulu war sir g wolselei divid the umtetwa into
two district appoint an umtetwa chief name somk ruler over on
and umlandela over the other
umlandela be a zulu and worn with ag ha never had ani author
over hi nomin subject and ha been anxiou to rid himself of the
danger and respons of hi chieftainship by transfer it on to
the shoulder of mr john dunn whose territori adjoin hi own and
who would be needless to sai noth loth to avail himself of the
opportun of increas hi taxabl area whilst thi intrigu wa in
progress all zululand wa convuls with the new of our defeat by the
boer and the consequ surrend of the transvaal it wa commonli
rumour that our forc were utterli destroi and that the boer were
now the domin power follow on the heel of thi intellig wa
a rumour to the effect that cetywayo wa come back these two report
both of which had a foundat of truth had a veri bad effect on the
vulgar mind in zululand and result in the set in motion of a
varieti of plot of which the follow wa the most import
the umtetwa tribe is among those who ar not anxiou for the return
of cetywayo but see in the present state of affair an opportun of
regain the power thei possess befor the dai of chaka if thei
were to have a king over zululand thei determin that it should be an
umtetwa king and somk on of the chief appoint by sir garnet
wa the man who aim at the throne he wa not howev anxiou to put
out hi hand at first further than he could draw it back so he adopt
a veri ingeni expedi it will be rememb that the old chief
dingiswayo fled to basutoland where he is report to have marri
it occur to somk that if he could produc a descend or a
pseudodescend of dingiswayo he would have no difficulti in begin
oper by dispossess umlandela of hi territori in favour of the
suppos law heir in fact he want a cat to pull the chestnut
out of the fire for him who could easili be got rid of afterward
accordingli on sitimela wa produc who is suppos to be an escap
convict from natal who gave out that he wa a grandson of dingiswayo
by a basuto woman and a great medicineman abl to kill everybodi by a
glanc of hi ey
to thi impostor adher flock from all part of zululand and
umlandela fly for hi life into john dunn territori sitimela
seiz upon the chieftainship the resid thereupon order him to
appear befor him but he as might be expect refus to come as it
wa posit necessari to put an end to the plot by some mean sinc
it further develop would have endang and perhap destroi the
weakkne zulu settlement mr osborn determin to proce to the
scene of action mahomet would not go to the mountain so the mountain
had to go to mahomet on arriv he pitch hi tent half wai between
the camp of sitimela and john dunn who had umlandela under hi charg
and summon somk the author of the plot to appear befor him ten
dai elaps befor the summon wa obei dure thi time and inde
until thei final escap the resid and hi companion could not
even ventur to the spring which wa close at hand to wash for fear
of be assassin all dai long thei could see line of arm
men swarm over the hill round them and hear them yell their
warsong at length somk appear accompani by over a thousand
arm warrior he wa order to withdraw hi forc from sitimela
armi and go home he went home but did not withdraw hi forc the
next dai sitimela himself appear befor the resid he wa order
to come with ten men he came with two thousand all arm wild with
excit and mouti medicin to make thi medicin thei had
kill and pound up a littl crippl boi and sever of umlandela
wive it afterward transpir that the onli reason sitimela did not
then and there kill the resid wa that he mr osborn had with him
sever chief who were secretli favour to sitimela caus and if
he had kill him he would accord to zulu custom have had to kill
them too mr osborn order sitimela to dispers hi forc or take
the consequ and wait a few dai for him to do so but see no
sign of hi complianc he then order the neighbour chief to fall
on him and at length withdrew from hi encampmentnon too soon that
veri night a parti of sitimela men came down to kill him and find
the tent in which he and hi companion had slept stand stab at
it suppos occup through the canva
sitimela wa defeat by the forc order out by the resid with
a loss of about 500 men it is howev worthi of note and show how
widespread wa the conspiraci that out of all the thousand promis
mr osborn wa onli abl to call out two thousand men
the appoint howev that ha occas the most critic is that
of john dunn who got the benjamin share of zululand in prefer to
hi brother chief the convert of an englishman into a zulu chief is
such a veri odd proceed that it is difficult to know what to think of
it john dunn is an ambiti man and most probabl ha design on the
throne he is also a man who understand the valu of monei of which
he make a great deal out of hi chieftainship at the same time it is
clear that so far as it goe hi rule is better than that of the other
chief he ha a uniform tax fix and ha even done someth in the
wai of start school and make road from all that i have been abl
to gather hi popular and influenc with the zulu ar overr
though he ha live amongst them so mani year and taken so mani of
their women to wife hi appoint wa a hazard experi and in
the long run is like to prove a mischiev on sinc ani attempt
amend of the settlement will be violent resist by him on the
ground of vest interest also if white men ar set over zulu at
all thei should be gentlemen in the posit of govern offic
not success adventur
perhap the onli wise thing done in connect with the settlement wa
the appoint of mr osborn cmg as british resid it is not
easi to find a man fit for that difficult and danger posit for
the proper fill of which mani qualif ar requir possess
of an intim knowledg of the zulu their languag and their mode of
thought and life and be besid a veri abl and energet offic
mr osborn would have save the settlement from break down if anybodi
could have save it as it is by the exercis of ceaseless energi and
at great person risk he ha preserv it from total collaps of the
danger and anxieti to which he is expos the account i have given
of the sitimela incid is a suffici exampl he is in fact
noth but a shadow for he ha no forc at hi command to ensur
obedi to hi decis or to prevent civil war and in zululand
oddli enough forc is a remedi should on chief threaten the peac of
the countri he can onli deal with him by call on anoth chief for
aid a posit that is neither dignifi nor right what is worst of
all is that the zulu ar begin to discov what a shadow he is and
with thi weaken posit he ha to pit hi singl brain against all
the thousand and on plot which ar be woven throughout zululand
the whole countri teem with plot mnyaman the late prime minist
and on of the ablest and perhap the most influenti man in zululand
is plot for the return of cetywayo bishop colenso again is as
usual work hi own wire and creat agit to forward hi
end whatev thei mai be at the moment john dunn on the other hand
is plot to succe cetywayo and so on ad infinitum such is the
state of affair with which our unfortun resid ha to contend
invest with larg imaginari power he ha in realiti noth but hi
person influenc and hi own wit to help him he ha no white man
to assist him but live alon in a brokendown tent and some mud
hut built by hi son hand for the govern have never kept their
promis to put him up a hous in the midst of thousand of restless
and scheme savag amidst plot against the peac and against hi
author he ha to do the best he can to carri out an impractic
settlement and to maintain the charact of english justic and the
honour of the english name were mr osborn to throw up hi post or to
be assassin the author would find it difficult to keep the
whole settlement from collaps like a card castl
nobodi who understood zulu charact and aspir could ever have
execut such a settlement as sir garnet wolselei unless he did it
in obedi to some motiv or instruct that it wa not advis
to publish it is true that sir garnet experi of the zulu wa
extrem small and that he put asid the advic of those who did know
them with that contempt with which he is wont to treat colonist and
their opinion sir garnet wolselei doe not like coloni peopl
possibl becaus thei have signal fail to appreci heavenborn
geniu in hi person or hi slapdash drumhead sort of wai of settl
the fate of countri and ar inde so rude as to openli sai that
in their opinion he did more mischief in africa in a few month than
it would take an ordinari offici a lifetim to accomplish
howev thi mai be stop hi ear as much as he might sir garnet
cannot have been entir blind to the import of what he wa do and
the onli explan of hi action is that he enter on it more with
the idea of flatter and gratifi english public opinion than of
do hi best for the zulu or the white colonist on their border a
great outcri had been rais at home where in common with most south
african affair the matter wa not thoroughli understood against the
suppos intend annex of zululand for the benefit of greedi
colonist it wa argu that colonist were anxiou for the annex
in order that thei might get the land to specul with and doubtless
thi wa in individu instanc true i fulli agre with those who
think that it would be unwis to throw open zululand to the european
settler not on account of the zulu who would benefit by the chang
but becaus the result would be a state of affair similar to that in
natal where there ar a few white men surround by an evergrow
mass of kafir but there is a vast differ between annex proper
and the protector it wa our duti to establish over the nativ such
an arrang would have present few difficulti and have brought
with it mani advantag white men could have been forbidden to settl
in the countri a small huttax such as the zulu would have cheerfulli
paid would have brought in forti or fifti thousand a year an ampl
sum to defrai the expens of the resid and subresid the
mainten of an adequ nativ forc to keep order and even the
execut of necessari public work it is imposs to overr the
advantag that must have result both to the zulu and their white
neighbour from the adopt of thi obviou plan among them be
last peac and secur to life and properti or to understand the
folli and cruelti that dictat the present arrang or rather
want of arrang not for mani year ha england miss such an
opportun of do good not onli at no cost but with posit
advantag to herself did we ow noth to thi peopl whose kingdom we
had broken up and whom we had been shoot down by thousand thei
mai well ask as thei do continu what thei have done that we should
treat them as we have and ar do
it cannot be too clearli understood that when the zulu laid down
their arm thei did so hope and believ that thei would be taken
over by the english govern which have been fairli beaten by
it thei now look on as their head or king and be rule like their
brethren in natal thei expect to have to pai tax and to have
white magistr place over them and thei or the bulk of them look
forward to the chang with pleasur it must be rememb that when
onc thei have found their master there exist no more lawabid
peopl in the world than the zulu provid thei ar rule firmli and
abov all justli believ that such a rule would fall to their lot
thei surrend when thei did how great then must their surpris
have been when thei found that without their wish be consult in
the matter their own hereditari king wa to be sent awai and thirteen
littl king set up in hi place with strangest of all a white man as
chief littl king whilst the british govern content itself with
place a resid in the countri to watch the troubl that must
ensu
such a settlement as thi could onli have on object and on result
neither of which is at all credit to the english peopl the zulu
were parcel out among thirteen chief in order that their strength
might be kept down by internecin war and mutual distrust and jealousi
and as though it were intend to render thi result more certain
territori were chuck about in the careless wai i have describ
whilst central author wa abolish and the vacant throne is dangl
befor all ey label the prize of the strongest of cours
sir garnet paper agreement with the chief were for the most part
disregard from the first for instanc everi chief ha hi armi
and us it too in zululand bloodsh is now a thing of everydai
occurr and the whole countri is torn by fear uncertainli and
consequ want the settlement is bear it legitim fruit some
thousand of zulu have alreadi been kill in direct consequ of it
and more will doubtless follow and thi is the outcom of all the blood
and treasur spent over the zulu war well we have settl zululand on
the most approv principl and thank heaven british influenc ha
not been extend
a sever famin is said to be immin in zululand
to show that i am not singular in my opinion as to the present state
of zululand i mai be allow to quot a few short extract taken at
random from halfadozen number of the natal mercuri talk of
the zulu settlement term as dictat by sir g wolselei the lead
articl of the issu 21st novemb 1881 saysit will at onc
be appar that these term have in sever case been flagrantli
violat especi as regard claus of 2 3 4 and 6 thi last
will assuredli be broken again and yet again so long as the british
resid occupi the posit of an offici mollusc the chief
themselv perceiv and admit the evil that must aris out of the
absenc of ani effect central author these evil ar so obviou
thei were so gener recognis at the outset as be inher in
the scheme that we might almost suppos their occurr had been
deliber anticip as a desir outcom of the settlement the
moral of such a line of polici would be precis on a par with that
which is involv in the propos to reinstat cetywayo as a mean of
deal with the boer the creation of thirteen kinglet in order that
thei might destroi each other is as human and highmind an effort
of statesmanship as would be the restor of a banish king in order
that he might eat up a peopl to whom the same power ha just given back
their independ to the simpl coloni mind such deep design
of machiavellian statecraft ar as hate as thei ar inhuman and
dishonest
a correspond of the mercuri in zululand write under date of 13th
octob
i send a line at the last moment to sai that thing ar go from bad
to wors at railwai speed up to the arriv of sir evelyn wood the

in the natal mercuri of the 13th march occur the follow
zulu countrya to the state of the countri it is someth we
cannot describ everyth is upsid down and the chief appoint by
the govern ar mere nobodi and have not ani power over their own

powerless to act either wai we had on row just arriv at a kraal in

sir garnet wolselei execut the zulu settlement on the 1st septemb
1879 the abov extract will suffic to show the state of the countri
after it ha been work for littl more than two year thei will
also i believ suffic to convinc ani just and imparti mind that i
do not exagger when i sai that it is an abomin and a disgrac
to england the languag mai be strong but when on hear of 1500
unfortun nearli twice as mani as we lost at isandhlwana be
slaughter in a singl intertrib broil it is time to us strong
languag it is not as though thi were an unexpect or an unavoid
develop of event everi man who knew the zulu predict the miseri
that must result from such a settlement but those who direct their
destini turn a deaf ear to all warn thei did not wish to hear
and now we ar told that civil war is immin between the cetywayo or
antisettl parti and what i must for want of a better name call
the john dunn parti or those who have acquir interest under the
settlement and who for variou reason wish to see cetywayo face no
more if thi occur and it will occur unless the govern make up
it mind to do someth befor long the slaughter not onli of men but
also of women and children will be enorm fugit will pour into
natal follow perhap by their pursuer and for aught we know the war
mai spread into our own dominion we ar a philanthrop peopl veri
when bulgarian ar concern or when the subject is on that piqu
the morbid curios or is the rage of the moment and the subject of
address from great and eloqu speaker but we can sit still and
let such massacr as these take place when we have but to hold up our
hand to stop them when occasion the veil is lift a littl and
the public hear of fresh fight in zululand a question is ask
in the hous mr courtnei as usual ha no inform but gener
discredit the report and it is put asid as probabl not true i
am well awar that of the few who read these word mani will discredit
them or sai that thei ar written for some object or for parti
purpos but it is not the case thei ar written in the interest of
the truth and in the somewhat faint hope that thei mai awaken a portion
of the public howev small to a knowledg of our respons
to the unfortun zulu for try to get rid of it as we mai those
respons rest upon our shoulder when we conquer the zulu
nation and sent awai the zulu king we undertook moral at ani rate
to provid for the futur good govern of the countri otherwis the
zulu war wa unjust inde if we continu to fail as we have hitherto
to carri out our respons as a human and christian nation ought
to do our laps from what is right will certainli recoil upon our own
head and in the stern lesson of futur troubl and disast we
shall learn that provid with the nation as with the individu
make a neglect duti it own aveng we have sown the wind let us be
care lest we reap the whirlwind
it is veri clear that thing cannot remain in their present condit
if thei do it is probabl that the resid will sooner or later
be assassin not from ani person motiv but as a polit
necess and some second chaka will rise up and found a new zulu
dynasti sweep awai our artifici chief and divis like cobweb
thi idea seem to have penetr into lord kimberlei offici mind
sinc in hi despatch of instruct to sir h bulwer written in
februari last he sai probabl if the chief ar left to themselv
after a period more or less prolong of war and anarchi some man will
rais himself to the posit of suprem chief the prospect of war and
anarchi in zululand doe not howev troubl lord kimberlei at all in
fact the whole despatch is typic to a degre of the liber coloni
polici lord kimberlei admit that what littl quiet the countri ha
enjoi under the settlement wa due to a mistaken belief on the part
of the zulu that the british govern wa rule them or would rule
them through the resid he evid clearli see all the evil and
bloodsh that ar result and that must result from the present
state of affair inde he recapitul them and then end up by even
refus to allow such slight measur of relief as the appoint of
subresid to be carri out although beg for by the chief on
the ground that it might extend british influenc of the interest of
the zulu himself he is quit careless the whole despatch can be sum
up thu if you can find ani method to improv the state of affair
which will not subject us to the smallest cost risk or respons
you can emploi it if not let them fight it out perhap lord
kimberlei mai live offici long enough to find out that mean
and selfish do not alwai pai and that it is not alwai desir
thu to sacrific the respect and crush the legitim aspir of a
gener peopl
unless someth is done befor long it is possibl that john dunn mai
succe after a bloodi war in secur the throne but thi would not
prove a perman arrang sinc he is now get on in life and
ha no son to carri on the dynasti anoth possibl and on that is
not gener known at ani rate in thi countri though it is perhap
the most probabl of all is thi cetywayo ha left a son in zululand
who is be carefulli educ under the care of mnyaman the late
king prime minist the boi is now about 16 year of ag and is
report to possess veri good abil and is the trump card that
mnyaman will plai as soon as the time is ripe thi young man is the
hereditari heir to the zulu crown and it is more than probabl that if
he is proclaim king the vast major of the nation will ralli round
him and establish him firmli on hi throne there is littl us in
keep cetywayo confin whilst hi son is at larg the lad should
have been brought to england and educ so that he might at some
futur time have assist in the civilis of hi countri as it is
he is grow up in a bad school
and now i come to the root of the whole matter the question whether
or no under all these circumst it is right or desir to
reestablish cetywayo on the throne of zululand in consid thi
question i think that cetywayo individu ought to be out on on
side howev much we mai sympathis with hi posit as i confess i
do to some extent myself after all cetywayo is onli on man wherea
the happi secur and perhap the live of mani thousand ar
involv in the issu of the question in come to ani conclus
in the matter it is necessari to keep in view the intent of the
govern as regard our futur connect with zululand if the
govern intend to do it duti and rule zululand as it ought to be
rule by the appoint of proper magistr the establish of an
adequ forc and the imposit of the necessari tax then it would
be the height of folli to permit cetywayo to return sinc hi presenc
would defeat the scheme it must be rememb that there is as yet
noth whatsoev to prevent thi plan be carri out it would be
welcom with joi by the larg major of both zulu and colonist it
would also solv the problem of the increas of the nativ popul of
natal which is assum the most alarm proport sinc zululand
be veri much underpopul it would be easi were that countri onc
quietli settl to draft the major of the natal zulu back into it
thi is undoubtedli the best cours and inde the onli right cours
but it doe not at all follow that it will be taken sinc govern
ar unfortun more concern at the prospect of lose vote than
with the genuin interest of their depend the proper settlement
of zululand would not be popular amongst a larg class in thi countri
and therefor it is not like to be carri out howev right and
necessari it mai be
if noth is go to be done then it becom a question whether or no
cetywayo should be sent back
the larg major of the natalian consid that hi restor would
be an act of suicid folli and their opinion is certainli entitl to
great weight sinc thei ar after all the peopl princip
concern the issu of the experi would be a matter of compar
indiffer to peopl live 7000 mile awai but is natur regard
with some anxieti by those who have their home on the border of
zululand it is veri well to sympathis with savag royalti in distress
but it must be born in mind that there ar other to be consid
besid the captiv king mani of the zulu for instanc ar by
no mean anxiou to see him again sinc thei look forward with just
apprehens to the line of action he mai take with those who have not
shown suffici anxieti for hi return or have in other wai incur
hi resent on thing is clear to send the king back to zululand is
to restor the statu in quo as it wa befor the war there can be
no half measur about it no more worthless paper stipul a zulu
king must either be allow to rule in hi own fashion or not at all
the war would go for noth and would doubtless have to be fought over
again with on of cetywayo successor
also it must be rememb that it is on thing to talk of restor
cetywayo and anoth to carri hi restor into effect it would not
simpli be a question of turn him down on the border of zululand and
let him find hi own wai back to hi throne for such a proceed
would be the signal for the outbreak of civil war it is not to be
suppos that john dunn and those whose interest ar ident with
dunn would allow the exk to reseat himself on the throne without
a struggl inde the former ha openli declar hi intent of
resist the attempt by forc of arm if necessari he is by no mean
anxiou to give up the 15000 pound a year hi huttax bring in and
all the conting profit and advantag of hi chieftainship if we
wish to restor cetywayo we must first depos dunn in fact we must be
readi to support hi restor by forc of arm
as regard cetywayo himself i cannot share the opinion of those who
think that he would be person danger he ha learnt hi lesson
and would not be anxiou to try conclus with the english again
inde i believ he would prove a staunch alli but suppos him
reestablish on the throne how long would it be befor a revolut
or the hand of the assassin to sai noth of the ordinari chanc
of natur put an end to him and how do we know that hi successor in
power would share hi view
cetywayo rule bad as it wa wa perhap prefer to the reign of
terror that we have establish under the name of a settlement but
that we can still remedi if we choos to do so wherea if we onc
restor cetywayo all power over the zulu pass out of our hand
we have mani interest to consid in south africa all of which will be
more or less affect by our action in thi matter on the whole i am
of opinion that the govern that replac cetywayo on the throne
of hi father will undertak a veri grave respons and must be
prepar to deal with mani result complic not the least of

natal ha an area of about 18000 squar mile and it present
popul is roughli 25000 white and 400000 nativ of the zulu
race when in 1843 it first becam a british coloni the number of
nativ live within it border wa veri small and thei were for the
most part wander fragmentari remnant of the tribe that chaka had
destroi i shall probabl be under rather than over the mark if i
sai that the zulu popul of the coloni ha multipli itself by ten
dure the last thirti year two caus have combin to bring about
thi extraordinari increas firstli wholesal immigr from the
surround territori and secondli the practic of polygami
thi immigr ha been due to a great want of foresight or want of
knowledg on the part of the home author who have allow it to
go on without check or hindranc till it ha in conjunct with it
twin evil polygami produc the state of affair it is my object to
describ ever sinc it first establish as a coloni natal ha been
turn into a citi of refug for the nativ inhabit of zululand the
transvaal swaziland and elsewher if new came to a zulu chief that
hi king purpos to eat him up he at onc fled across the tugela with
hi wive and follow and settl in natal if the boer or swazi
destroi a tribe the remnant found it wai to natal
that countri inde is to the south african nativ a modern isl of
the blest onc across the border line and whatev hi crime he
is in a posit to defi hi worst enemi and can rest secur in the
protect of the home and local govern and of the enact
special pass to protect him and hi privileg the govern
allot him land or if it doe not he squat on privat land bring
with him hi own peculiar and barbar custom in all the world i do
not know a race more favour by circumst than the natal zulu
thei live on the produc of the field that their wive cultiv or
rather scratch do littl or no work and have no occas to do
ani thei ar veri rich and their tax ar a mere trifl fifteen
shill per annum for each hut thei bear no share of the curs that
come to all other men as a birthright thei need not labour protect
by a power govern thei do not fear attack from without or
intern disord what all men desir rich and women ar their in
abund and even their children the object of so much expens and
sore perplex to civilis parent ar to them a sourc of wealth
their need ar few a straw hut corn for food and the bright sun
thei ar not even troubl with the thought of a futur life but like
the anim live through their healthi happi dai and at last in
extrem old ag meet a death which for them ha no terror becaus it
simpli mean extinct when compar to that of civilis race or
even of their own brethren in the interior their lot is inde a happi
on
but the stream of immigr continu though it ha been would not
by itself have suffic to bring up the nativ popul to it present
enorm total without the assist of the polygam custom of the
immigr
i believ that inquir have ascertain that as a gener rule the
practic of polygami ha not the effect of bring about an abnorm
growth of popul howev thi mai be elsewher in natal ow in
great measur to the healthi custom of the zulu race the rate of
increas is unpreced mani writer and other author consid
polygami as an institut to be at onc wick and disgust as to
it moral it is a point upon which it is difficult to express ani
opinion nor inde doe the question enter into the scope of what i
have to sai but it must be rememb that in the case of the zulu hi
whole law and exist is mix up with the institut and that it
is necessari to him to repair the gap made in hi rank by war violent
antipolygamist in thi countri alwai make a strong point of the
cruelti it is suppos to involv to the women and talk about the
violat of their holiest feel as a matter of fact sad as it
mai appear the zulu women ar much attach to the custom nor would
thei as a gener rule consent to marri a man who onli purpos take
on wife there ar variou reason for thi for instanc the first
wife is a person of import and take preced of all the other
a fact as much appreci by the zulu woman as by the london ladi
again the more wive there ar the more wealth it bring into the
famili sinc in the ordinari cours of natur more wive mean more
femal children who when thei come to a marriag ag mean in
their turn at least ten cow each the govern price for a wife the
amount thu obtain is place to the credit of the estat of the mother
of the girl marri and for thi reason all zulu women ar extrem
anxiou to have children especi femal children final the
like of zulu women for the custom is bred in them it ha been go
on for countless gener and it is probabl that it will go on for
so long as the race endur nation do not chang such habit unless
the chang is forc on them with the altern of extermin
as soon as a zulu woman is discov to be pregnant
her husband ceas to cohabit with her nor doe he live
with her again until the child is wean eighteen month
and sometim two year after it birth
polygami will never be erad by moral persuas becaus even
if a nativ could be brought to think it wrong which is in itself
imposs it abolit would affect hi interest irredeem a
zulu wive ar also hi servant thei plough hi land and husband hi
grain in addit to bear hi children had he but on wife most
of her time would be taken up with the latter occup and then the
mealiepl and gather would necessarili fall to the lot of
the husband a state of affair he would never consent to again if
monogami were establish girl would lose their valu and a great
sourc of wealth would be destroi it must howev be understood
that zulu girl ar not exactli sold the cow receiv by the parent
ar by a legal fiction suppos to be a gift present not a price
paid should the wife subsequ run awai thei ar i believ
return
on these subject as is not to be wonder at when so mani interest
ar concern the zulu law is a littl intric the cleverest
counsel in the templ could not give an opinion on such a case as the
follow
a ha four wive and children by no 1 and 3 on hi death hi
brother b a rich man take over hi wive and properti and ha
children by each of the four women he ha also children by other wive
on hi death in extrem old ag how should the properti be divid
amongst the descend of the variou marriag
it is clear that if such a case as thi is to be dealt with at all
it must be under nativ law and thi is on of the great danger of
polygami onc root in a state it necessit a doubl system of
law sinc civilis law is quit unabl to cope with the case daili
aris from it practic it is sometim argu that the law emploi
is a matter of indiffer provid that substanti justic is done
accord to the idea of peopl concern and thi is doubtless veri
true if it is accept as a fact that the zulu popul of natal is
alwai to remain in it present condit of barbar to continu
to administ their law is to give it the sanction of the white man
author and everi dai that it is so administ make it more
imposs to do awai with it i sai more imposs advisedli
becaus i believ it abrog is alreadi imposs there is no
satisfactori wai out of the difficulti becaus it ha it root in
and draw it exist from the principl of polygami which i believ
will last while the peopl last
some reli on the missionari to effect thi stupend chang and turn a
polygam peopl into monogamist but it is a wellknown fact that the
missionari produc no more perman effect on the zulu mind than a
child doe on the granit rock which he chip at with a chisel how mani
real christian ar there in zululand and natal and of that select and
saintli band how mani practis monogami but veri few and among those
few there is a larg proport of bad charact men who have
adopt christian as a last resourc i mean no disrespect to the
missionari mani of whom ar good men do their best under the most
unpromis condit though some ar simpli trader and polit
agit but the fact remain the same christian make no
appreci progress amongst the zulu nativ whilst on the other
hand no on have ani experi in the countri will if he can avoid
it have a socal christian kafir in hi hous becaus the term is
but too frequent synonym with that of drunkard and thief i do not
wish it to be understood that it is the fact of hi christian that so
degrad the zulu becaus i do not think it ha anyth to do with it
it is onli that the novic stand on the threshold of civilis
as a rule find the vice of the white man more congeni than hi
virtu
the zulu ar as difficult to convinc of the truth of christian as
were the jew whom thei so much resembl in their custom thei have a
natur disinclin to believ that which thei cannot see and be
constitution veri clever and casuist ar prepar to argu each
individu point with an abil veri try to missionari it wa on
of these zulu known as the intellig zulu but in realiti no more
intellig than hi fellow whose shrewd remark first caus doubt
to aris in the mind of bishop colenso and through him in those of
thousand of other
anoth difficulti in the wai of the missionari is that he is oblig
to insist on the put awai of surplu wive and thu to place
himself out of court at the outset it is quit conceiv that in the
opinion of wild and savag men it is prefer to let the new teach
alon rather than to adopt it at the cost of such a radic chang
in their domest arrang as a case in point i mai quot that of
hlubi the basutu appoint chief of on of the divis of zululand
by sir g wolselei hlubi is at heart a christian and a good man and
anxiou to be baptiz the missionari howev refus to baptiz
him becaus he ha two wive hlubi therefor remain a heathen
sai not unnatur that he feel it would be imposs for him to
put awai a woman with whom he ha live for so mani year
whilst polygami endur christian will advanc with but small
stride it seem to me that we ar begin at the wrong end we must
civilis first and christianis afterward as well try to sow corn
among rock and look to gather a full crop as expect the word of
grace and divin love to bear fruit in the heart of a peopl whose
forefath have for countless gener been men of blood whose
prize tradit ar on long stori of slaughter and who if thei
ar now at peac ar as it were onli gather strength for a surer
spring first the soil must be prepar befor the seed is sown
to do thi there is but on wai abolish nativ custom and law
especi polygami and bring our zulu subject within the pale of our
own law depriv them of their troop of servant in the shape of wive
and thu forc them to betak themselv to honest labour like the rest
of mankind
there is onli on object in the wai of the realis of thi
scheme which would doubtless bring about in the cours of a
gener a much better state of thing and gather mani thousand
convert into the fold of the church and that is the opportun ha
so far as natal is concern been missedth time ha gone by when it
could have been carri out to young countri as to young men there
come sometim opportun of control their futur destini
which if not seiz at the moment pass awai for ever or onli to
return after long and troubl year natal ha had her chanc and it
ha gone awai from her though through no fault of her own if when the
coloni wa first settl the few nativ who then live there had
been forc to conform to the usag of civilis life or to quit it
border if refuge had been refus admiss save on the same term
it would not occupi the veri seriou posit it doe at the present
moment
to understand the situat into which natal ha drift with refer
to it nativ inhabit it is necessari to premis that that countri
ha hitherto had practic no control over it own affair more
especi as regard nativ legisl
in it earli dai it wa a happi quiet place a favour clime where
the travel or settler could find good shoot cheap labour
and cheap live no enemi threaten it rest and the nativ were
respect and peac in their behaviour but it wa in those dai
that the nativ difficulti that upa tree that now overshadow and
poison the whole land took root for slowli from all part all
through that quiet time by on by ten by hundr refuge
were flow in and ask and receiv land to settl on from the
govern
it is not howev to be suppos that the local offici did not
perceiv the gather danger sinc it ha again and again been point
out to differ secretari of state and again and again been
ignor by them or put off for the consider of their successor
handtomouth legisl ha alwai been the characterist of our rule
in south africa on on occas sir theophilu then mr shepston
went so far as to offer to person draw off a larg portion of the
nativ popul and settl them on some vacant territori border
on the cape coloni but the suggest wa not acced to for fear
lest the execut of the scheme should excit disturb amongst the
nativ of the cape thu year after year ha pass awayplan after
plan ha been put asideand noth ha been done
in the coloni a great deal of abus is pour out on the head of sir t
shepston to whom the present nativ situat is unjustli attribut
by a certain parti of politician sir t shepston wa for veri mani
year secretari for nativ affair in natal but until he came to
england shortli befor the termin of hi offici career he wa
person unknown to the coloni offic and had no influenc there
it wa total out of hi power to control the polici of the home
govern with refer to the natal nativ he could onli take
thing as he found them and make the best of such materi as came to
hi hand as he could not keep the nativ out of the coloni or prevent
polygami he did what he could toward make them loyal and content
subject how well he succeed and with what consumm tact and
knowledg he must have exercis hi author is shown by the fact
that in all these year there ha been but on nativ disturb
name that of langalibalel and by the further fact that the loyalti
of the natal zulu stood the strain of the zulu war also there never
ha been and probabl never will be anoth white man so univers
belov and reverenc by the nativ throughout the length and breadth
of south africa
but sir t shepston influenc for good will pass awai as all pure
person influenc must and meanwhil what is the situat on
the on hand there is a veri slowli increas scatter and mix
popul of about 25000 white capabl at the outsid of put a
forc of 4000 men in the field on the other there is a warlik nativ
popul unit by the ti of race and common interest number
at the present moment between 400000 and 500000 and increas by
leap and bound capabl of put quit 80000 warrior into the
field and possess besid numer stronghold call locat
at present these two rival popul live side by side in peac and
amiti though at heart neither love the other the two race ar so
total distinct that it is quit imposs for them to have much
commun of feel thei can never mingl their idea ar differ
their object ar differ and in natal their veri law is differ
kafir respect and like individu englishmen but i doubt whether thei
ar particularli fond of us as a race though thei much prefer us to ani
other white men and ar devot to our rule so long as it is necessari
to them the averag white man on the other hand detest the kafir
and look on him as a lazi goodfornoth who ought to work for him
and will not work for him whilst he is quit incap of appreci
hi mani good point it is an odd trait about zulu that onli
gentlemen in the true sens of the word can win their regard or get
anyth out of them
it is obviou that sooner or later these two race must come into
contact the question be how long the present calm will last to thi
question i will ventur to suggest an answeri believ the right on
it will last until the nativ get so cramp for room that he ha no
place left to settl on except the white man land the white man
will then try to turn him off whereupon the nativ will fall back on
the primari resourc of kill him and possess himself of the land
by forc thi plan simultan carri out on a larg scale would
place the coloni at the merci of it nativ inhabit
nor is the time so veri far distant when englishmen and zulu will stand
face to face over thi land question in the earli dai of the coloni
locat were establish in the mountain district becaus thei
were compar worthless and the nativ were settl in them by
tribe of what goe on in these locat veri littl is known except
that thei ar crowd and that the inhabit ar as entir wed
to their savag custom as their forefath were befor them as there
is no more room in the locat mani thousand of kafir have settl
upon privat land sometim with and sometim without the leav
of the owner but for mani reason thi is a state of affair that
cannot go on for ever in a few year the privat land will be fill
up as well as the locat and what then
zulu ar a peopl who requir a veri larg quantiti of land sinc thei
possess great number of cattl which must have graze room also their
cultiv be of the most primit order and consist as it doe
of pick out the veri richest patch of land and crop them till
thei ar exhaust all ordinari land be reject as too much troubl
to work the possess or the right of usor of sever hundr acr
is necessari to the support of a singl famili nor if we mai judg
from preced and it wellmark characterist is it to be
suppos that thi race will at the pinch suit itself to circumst
take up less land and work harder zulu would rather fight to the last
than discard a cherish and an ancient custom savag thei ar
and savag thei will remain and in the struggl between them and
civilis it is possibl that thei mai be conquer but i do not
believ that thei will be convert the zulu kafir is incompat with
civilis
it will be seen from what i have said that natal might more properli
be call a black settlement than an english coloni look at it from
the former point of view it is a veri interest experi for the
first time probabl sinc their race came into exist zulu nativ
have got a chanc given them of increas and multipli without be
period decim by the accid of war whilst at the same time
enjoi the protect of a strong and a just govern it remain
to be seen what us thei will make of their opportun that thei will
avail themselv of it for the purpos of civilis themselv i do
not believ but it seem to me possibl that thei will learn from
the white man the advantag of combin and aim at develop
themselv into a power and unit black nation
it is in the face of thi state of thing that lord kimberlei now
propos to grant respons govern to the white inhabit of
natal should thei be will to accept it provid that it is to
carri with it the respons of rule the nativ and further of
defend the coloni from the attack of it neighbour whether white
or colour
natal ha hitherto been rule under a hybrid constitut which whilst
allow the legisl assembl of the coloni to pass law c
reserv all real author to the crown there ha howev been
for some year past a grow agit amongst a proport of it
inhabit institut with the object of induc the home govern
to conced practic independ to the coloni her majesti have
on sever occas been petit on the subject by the legisl
council on the 13th februari 1880 sir g wolselei who wa at the
time governor of natal wrote what i can onli call a veri intemper
despatch to the secretari of state comment on the prayer for
respons govern which he strongli condemn he also took
the opportun to make a seri of somewhat viciou attack on the
colonist in gener whose object in ask for independ wa he
impli to bring the black man in relat of appropri servitud
to hi white superior it would appear howev from word us by him
toward the end of hi despatch that the real reason of hi violenc
wa that he fear that on of the first act of the natal parliament
would be to put an end to hi settlement in zululand which wa and
is the laughingstock of the coloni he wa probabl right in thi
supposit the variou charg he bring against the colonist
ar admir and conclus refut in a minut adopt by the
legisl council of natal date 20th decemb 1880
in a despatch date 15th march 1881 lord kimberlei refus to acced
to the request for the grant of respons govern
on the 28th of decemb the legisl council again petit the
crown on the subject and forward to lord kimberlei a report of a select
committe appoint to consid the matter in which the follow word
occur
your committe hold that while the coloni mai well be held respons
for it defenc from such aggress as mai be caus by the act or
polici of a respons govern it cannot justli be saddl with the
oblig to meet act of aggress from border territori
that have arisen out of the circumst or measur over which such
govern have had no control although as a matter of fact the brunt
of defenc must be born in the first instanc by the colonist
the council therefor neither exercis nor desir to exercis ani
control over territori adjac to or border on the coloni for the
preserv of it own intern peac and order the coloni is prepar
to provid the duti of protect the coloni from extern foe
whether by sea or land devolv on the empir as a whole otherwis to
be a section of that empir constitut no real privileg
to thi report somewhat to the surpris of the natalian lord
kimberlei return in a despatch address to sir h bulwer on the
occas of hi departur to take up the governorship of natal and
date 2d februari 1882 a most favour repli in fact he is so
oblig as to far exce the wish of the natalian as express in
the passag just quot and to tell them that her majesti govern
is not onli readi to give them respons govern but that it
will expect them to defend their own frontier independ of ani
assist from the imperi govern he further inform them that
the imperi troop will be withdrawn and that the onli respons
her majesti govern will retain with refer to the coloni will
be that of it defenc against aggress by foreign power
thi sudden chang of face on the part of the imperi govern which
had up till now flatli refus to grant ani measur of selfgovern
to natal mai at first seem rather odd but on examin it will
be found to be quit in accord with the recent develop south
african polici of mr gladston govern there is littl doubt
that it is an articl of faith among the liber parti that the less
the mothercountri ha to do with her coloni and more especi
her south african coloni the better a grand step wa made in
the direct of the abandon of our south african empir when we
surrend the transvaal to the boer and it is clear that if our
troop can be withdrawn from natal and all respons for the safeti
of that coloni put an end to the triumph of selfeffac will be
still more complet but there is anoth and more immedi reason
for lord kimberlei gener offer he know no on better that
the polici pursu in south africa both as regard the transvaal and
zululand must produc it legitim fruitbloodshedbefor veri
long he or rather hi govern is consequ anxiou to cut the
connect befor anyth of the sort occur when thei will be abl to
attribut the troubl whatev it is to the illadvis action of the
coloni legislatur
what is still more strang howev is that the colonist have
regard to the posit thei occupi with refer to the kafir that
surround them to whom thei bear the same rel proport that the
oas do in the desert or the island of an archipelago to the ocean
that wash their shore should wish for such a danger boon as that
of selfgovern if inde thei realli do wish it when i live in
natal i often heard the subject discuss and watch the legisl
council pass it period resolut about it but i confess i alwai
look on the matter as be more or less of a farc there exist
howev in natal a knot of politician who ar doubtless desir
of the chang partli becaus thei think that it would be realli
benefici and partli becaus thei ar possess by a laudabl ambit
to fill the high posit of prime minist treasur c in the
futur parliament but these gentlemen for the most part live in town
where thei ar compar safe should a nativ rise occur i have
not notic the same enthusiasm for respons govern among those
natalian who live up countri in the neighbourhood of the locat
still there doe exist a consider parti who ar in favour of the
chang a parti that ha recent sprung into exist mani thing
have occur within the last few year to irrit and even exasper
peopl in natal with the imperi govern and gener with the
treatment that thei have receiv at our hand for instanc colonist
ar proverbi sensit and it is therefor rather hard that everi
newspap correspond or itiner bookmak who come to their
shore should at onc proce to print endless letter and book
abus them without merci the fact of the matter is that these
gentlemen come and put up at the hotel and potshop where thei meet
all the loafer and bad charact in the countri whom thei take to be
specimen of the best class of colonist whom thei describ accordingli
as the riddl of societi into the quiet respect and happi
home that realli give the tone to the coloni thei do not enter
it is also a favourit accus to bring against the peopl of natal
that thei make the south african war in order to make monei out of
them for instanc in a lead articl of on of the princip english
journal it wa state not long ago that the murmur of the colonist
at be forc to eat the bread of humili in the transvaal
matter aros from no patriot feel but from sorrow at the earli
termin of a war out of which thei hope to suck no small advantag
thi statement is quit untru
no doubt a great deal of monei ha been made out of the war by a few
coloni specul some of it mayb dishonestli but thi is not
an unusu occurr in a foreign war wa no monei made dishonestli
by english specul and contractor in the crimean war cannot
manchest boast manufactur readi to suppli our enemiesfor cash
paymentswith gun to shoot us with or ani other materi of war
it is not to be suppos that becaus a few specul made fortun
out of the commissariat that the whole coloni particip in the spoil
of the variou war on the contrari the marjor of it inhabit
have suffer veri larg not onli have thei run consider person
risk but sinc and ow to the zulu and boer war the cost of live
ha almost if not quit doubl which needless to sai ha not been
the case with their incom it is therefor particularli cruel that
natal should be gibbet as the abod of scoundrel of the worst sort
men prepar to bring about bloodsh in order to profit by it sir
garnet wolselei howev found in thi report of coloni dishonesti
a conveni point of vantag from which to attack the colonist
gener and in hi despatch about respons govern we mai be
sure he did not spare them the legisl council thu comment on hi
remark to colonist a war mean the spread among them of distress
alarm and confus peril to life and properti in outli district
the arrest of progress and gener disorganis the council
regard with pain and indign the uncalledfor and cruel stigma thu
cast upon the colonist by sir garnet wolselei
at first sight these accus mai not appear to have much to do with
the question of whether or no the colonist should accept respons
govern but in realiti thei have inasmuch as thei creat a
feel of sore that inclin the natalian to get rid of imperi
interfer and the attend critic at ani price
more substanti grievanc against the english govern ar the
present condit of the nativ problem which the colonist justli
attribut to imperi mismanag and that triumph of geniu sir
garnet wolselei settlement in zululand thei see these evil which
thei know were prevent grow more formid dai by dai and thei
imagin or some of them do that if thei had free institut it would
still be in their power to stop that growth
the whole question ha now been refer to the coloni which is
to elect a fresh legisl assembl on the issu of respons
govern the struggl between the parti of progress ie the
respons govern section and the reactionist or those who
ar prepar to dispens with freedom provid thei can be sure of
safeti is be carri on keenli and at present it is doubt which
side will have a major i do not howev believ that the major
of ani council return will consent to accept lord kimberlei propos
as it stand to walk into a parlour in which the spider is so veri
obviou and to deliber undertak the guardianship of all the
imperi interest in southeastern africa if thei do thei will in my
opinion deserv all thei will get
sinc thi chapter wa written the natal constitu
have as i thought probabl declar against the accept
of lord kimberlei offer in it present form by return
a major of antirespons govern men it is
howev probabl that the new legisl council will try
to reopen negoti on a differ or at ani rate a
modifi basi
the natalian ar fortun at the present crisi in have by dint of
vigor agit against the appoint of mr sendal a gentleman
select by lord kimberlei to govern them obtain the reappoint
of their former governor sir henri bulwer sir henri dure hi
first tenur of offic lost credit with the south african colonist
on account of hi lukewarm with refer to the zulu war but the
cours of event ha gone far toward justifi hi view he is on
of the most hardwork and care governor that natal ha ever had
and perhap the most judici of a temper and a cautiou mind
he mai be more safe trust to pilot a countri so surround with
difficulti and danger as natal is than most men and it is to be
hope that the applic to the question of the dai of the strong
common sens that he possess in such an emin degre mai have a
cool effect on the hot head and excit imagin of the parti
of progress
in consid the pro and con of the respons govern question
it must be steadili kept in sight that natal is not like to be a
countri with a peac futur to begin with she ha her nativ
inhabit to deal with todai thei number sai 450000 fifteen or
twenti year henc thei will number a million or perhap more these
men ar no longer the docil overgrown children thei were twenti year
ago the lesson of our perform in the zulu and boer war more
especi the latter have not been lost upon them and thei
ar begin to think that the white man instead of be the
unconquer demigod thei thought him is somewhat of a humbug
pharaoh we know grew afraid of the israelit natal with a much
weaker power at command than that of pharaoh ha got to cope with a
still more danger element and on that cannot be induc to depart
into the wilder
and after all what doe the power of natal amount to let us be liber
and sai six thousand men it is the outsid in the event of a nativ
rise or ani other seriou war i believ that of thi number at
least two thousand would make themselv scarc there exist in all
coloni a float element of individu who have drift there for
the purpos of make monei but who have no real affect for the
temporari countri of their adopt their capit is as a rule
small and easili realis and the veri last thing that thei would think
of do would be to engag in a deadli life or death struggl on
behalf of a land that thei onli look on as a milch cow out of which
their object is to draw as much as possibl on the contrari thei would
promptli seek anoth cow leav the old on to the tender merci of
the butcher
their defect would leav some 4000 men to cope with the difficulti
whatev it wa of which number at least 1000 would be ineffect from
ag and variou other caus whilst of the remaind quit 1000 would
be oblig to remain where thei were to protect women and children in
outli district thi would leav a total effect forc of 2000
men or deduct 500 for garrison purpos of 1500 readi to take the
field but it would take some time to collect arm and equip even thi
number and in the meanwhil in the case of a sudden and preconcert
nativ rise half the inhabit of the coloni would be murder in
detail
but natalian have got other danger to fear besid those aris from
the presenc of thi vast mass of barbar in their midst after
a period of anarchi a new king mai possess himself of the throne of
zululand and it is even possibl that he might under circumst
that will aris hereaft lead hi armi into natal and creat
a difficulti with which the 1500 avail white men would find it
difficult to cope or the boer of the orang free state and transvaal
mai get tire of pai custom due at durban and march 5000 men down
to take possess of the port perhap natal might provid herself with
an effect forc by enrol an armi of 10000 or 20000 kafir
but it seem to me that the proceed would be both uncertain and
expens and should the armi take it into it head to mutini veri
danger to boot
it is a notic fact that those who so ardent advoc the
accept of lord kimberlei offer in all their speech address
and articl almost entir shirk thi question of defenc which
is after all the root of the matter i have form my estim of the
number of men forthcom in time of danger on the supposit that a
burgher law wa in forc in natal that is that everi man remain in
the countri should be oblig to take a part in it defenc but thei
do not even hint at a burgher lawin fact thei repudi the idea
becaus thei know that it would not be toler the univers servic
system is not the natalian idea of happi thei simpli avoid the
question call it the defenc bugbear and assum that it will all
be arrang in some unforeseen wai
the onli suggest that i have yet seen as regard the arrang
for the futur defenc of the coloni should it becom independ is
a somewhat omin on namelythat natal should enter into a close
allianc offens and defens with the transvaal and the orang
free state but as the advoc of freedom would soon find the
orang free state for even if will to help them the transvaal will
for some year have enough to do with it own affair will not come
forward for noth there would first have to be a few busi
formal with refer to the custom due collect in durban on
good pass through to the interior which yield the bulk of the
natal revenu and possibl some concess to boer public opinion as
regard the english mode of deal with the natal nativ i inclin
to the opinion that in reli on the assist of the boer in time of
troubl the inhabit of natal would be lean on a broken reed thei
ar more like to find them in arm against them than fight on their
side
the parti of progress also talk much about the prospect of
confeder with the cape if onc thei get respons govern
most peopl howev will think that the fact of their be
independ and therefor respons for their own defenc will
hardli prove an induc to the cape to offer to share those
respons the onli confeder possibl to natal as a
selfgovern commun will be a boer confeder to which it
mai be admittedon certain term anoth cry is that the moment
respons govern is establish immigr will flow into the
countri and thu restor the balanc of race i take the liberti to
doubt the truth of thi supposit the intend emigr from europ
doe not it is true understand the in and out of the natal nativ
question but he doe now that it is a place where there ar war and
rumour of war and where he might possibl be kill and the result
is that he wise goe to some other coloni that ha equal advantag
to offer and no kafir to suppos that the emigr would go to natal
when he came to understand that it wa an independ settlement of a
few white men live in the midst of a mass of warlik kafir when
australia new zealand canada and the unit state ar all hold
out their arm to him is to suppos him a bigger fool than he is
at the best of time natal is not like to attract mani desir
emigr under a respons govern i do not believ that it will
attract ani
it seem to me that there is onli on condit of affair under
which it would be at all possibl for the natalian to assum the
respons of selfgovern with ani safeti and that is when
the great bulk of the nativ popul ha been remov back to whenc
it camezululand caus of a diametr opposit natur to
those that have been at work among the nativ of natal have been in
oper amongst their brethren in zululand in natal peac polygami
plenti and immigr have bred up an enorm nativ popul in
zululand war privat slaughter by the king order and the sever
restrict put upon marriag have kept down the increas of the race
also an enorm number of individu have fled from the on countri
into the other i do not suppos that the popul of zululand
amount at the present moment to much more than half that of natal
in thi state of affair li the onli real kei to the natal nativ
difficulti let zululand be convert into a black coloni under
english control and it present inhabit be establish in suitabl
locat then let all the nativ of natal with the except of
those who choos to becom monogamist and be subject to civilis law
be move into zululand and also establish in locat there would
be plenti of room for them all of cours there would be difficulti in
the wai of the realis of thi scheme but i do not think that thei
would prove insuper it is probabl howev that it would requir
a show of forc befor the natal nativ would consent to budg inde
it is absurd to suppos that anyth would induc them to leav
peac natal and plung into the seeth cauldron of bloodsh
extort and polit plot that we have cook up in zululand under
the name of a settlement proper provis must first be made for
the govern of the countri and secur to life and properti made
certain till thi is done no nativ in their sens will return to
zululand
till thi is done too or till some other plan is discov by mean
of which the nativ difficulti can be effect dealt with the
natalian will inde be foolish if thei discard the protect of
england and accept the fatal boon of selfgovern if thei do their
futur career mai be brilliant but i believ that it will be brief
it is no answer to urg that at present the nativ seem quit quiet
and that there is no indic of disturb
histori tell us that befor the destruct of doom pompeii
vesuviu wa veri still onli dai by dai the dark cloud hang over
the mountain summit grew denser and blacker we know what happen to
pompeii
i do not wish to suggest anyth unpleas far from it but
sometim i cannot help think that it is perhap a matter worth the
consider of the natalian whether it might not be as well instead
of talk about respons govern to improv upon the exampl of
the inhabit of pompeii and take to their ship befor the volcano
begin to work
it seem to me that there is an ugli cloud gather on the polit
horizon in natal

the histori of the republ between 1852 and 1876 is not veri

from the govern 6000 acr of land as these right were in the

still requir hi 6000 acr for a boer consid it beneath hi

countri to satisfi all demand to meet these demand the territori
of the republ had to be stretch like an elast band and thei were
stretch accordinglyat the expens of the nativ the stretch
process wa an ingeni on and is veri well describ in a minut
written by mr osborn the late magistr at newcastl date 22d
septemb 1876 in these word
the boer as thei have done in other case and ar still do
encroach by degre on nativ territori commenc by obtain

ensu damag for trespass is levi by him from the veri man from whom
he obtain the right to squat to which the nativ submit out of fear
of the matter reach the ear of the paramount chief who would in all
probabl sever punish them for open the door to encroach
by the boer after a while howev the matter come to a crisi in
consequ of the incess disput between the boer and the nativ
on or other of the disput lai the case befor the paramount chief
who when hear both parti is liter frighten with violenc
and threat by the boer into grant him the land upon thi the usual
plan follow by the boer is at onc to collect a few neighbour
boer includ a field cornet or even an act provision field
cornet appoint by the field cornet or provision cornet the latter
to repres the govern although without instruct authoris
him to act in the matter a few cattl ar collect among themselv
which the parti take to the chief and hi signatur is obtain to a

out never clearli or intellig explain to the chief who sign and
accept of the cattl under the impress that it is all in settlement
of hire for the graze licens grant by hi headmen thi i have no
hesit in sai is the usual method by which the boer obtain
what thei call cession to them of territori by nativ chief in
secocoeni case thei alleg that hi father sequati cede to them the
whole of hi territori hundr of squar mile for a hundr head of
cattl
so rapidli did thi progress go on that the littl republ to the
north of the vaal river had at the time of the annex grown into
a countri of the size of franc it boundari had onli been clearli
defin where thei abut on neighbour white commun or on
the territori of great nativ power on which the govern had not
dare to infring to ani mark degre such as those of lo bengula
peopl in the north but wheresoev on the state border there had
been no white power to limit it advanc or where the nativ tribe
had found themselv too isol or too weak to resist aggress
there the republ had by degre encroach and extend the shadow if
not the substanc of it author
the transvaal ha a boundari line of over 1600 mile in circumfer
and of thi a larg portion is disput by differ nativ tribe
speak gener the territori li between the 22 and 28 degre of
south latitud and the 25 and 32 degre of east longitud or between
the orang free state natal and griqualand west on the south and the
limpopo river on the north and between the lebombo mountain on the
east and the kalihari desert on the west on the north of it territori
live three great tribe the makalaka the matabel descend of
the zulu who desert chaka under mosilikatz and the matyana these
tribe ar all warlik on the west follow the line down to the
diamond field territori ar the sich the bangoaketsi the baralong
and the koranna tribe pass round by griqualand west the free
state and natal we reach zululand on the southeast corner then
come the lebombo mountain on the east separ the transvaal from
amatonga land and from the socal portugues possess which
ar entir in the hand of nativ tribe most of them subject to the
great zulu chief umzeila who ha hi stronghold in the northeast
it will be observ that the countri is almost surround by nativ
tribe besid these there ar about on million nativ inhabit
live within it border in on district alon zoutpansberg it
is comput that there ar 364250 nativ as compar to about 750
white
if a beauti and fertil countri were alon necessari to make a state
and it inhabit happi and prosper happi and prosper would
rain upon the transvaal and the dutch boer the capabl of thi
favour land ar vast and variou within it border ar to be found
highland and lowland vast stretch of roll veldt like gigant
sheep down hundr of mile of swell bushland huge tract of
mountain countri and even littl glade spot with timber that
remind on of an english park there is everi possibl varieti of soil
and sceneri some district will grow all tropic produc whilst
other ar well suit for breed sheep cattl and hors most
of the district will produc wheat and all other cereal in greater
perfect and abund than ani of the other south african coloni
two crop of cereal mai be obtain from the soil everi year and
both the vine and tobacco ar cultiv with great success coffe
sugarcan and cotton have been grown with profit in the northern part
of the state also the undevelop miner wealth of the countri is veri
great it known miner ar gold copper lead cobalt iron coal
tin and plumbago copper and iron have long been work by the
nativ altogeth there is littl doubt that the transvaal is the
richest of all the south african state and had it remain under
english rule it would with the aid of english enterpris and capit
have becom a veri wealthi and prosper countri howev there is
littl chanc of that now
perhap the greatest charm of the transvaal li in it climat which
is among the best in the world and in all the southern district veri
healthi dure the winter month that is from april to octob littl
or no rain fall and the climat is cold and brace in summer it is
rather warm but not overpoweringli hot the thermomet at pretoria
averag from 65 to 73 degre and in the winter from 59 to 56
degre the popul of the transvaal is estim at about 40000
white mostli of dutch origin consist of about thirti vast
famili and on million nativ there ar sever town the largest
of which ar pretoria and potchefstroom
such is the countri that we annex in 1877 and were drum out of
in 1881 now let us turn to it inhabit it ha been the fashion to
talk of the transvaal as though nobodi but boer live in it in realiti
the inhabit were divid into three class 1 nativ 2 boer
3 english i sai were divid becaus the english class can now hardli
be said to exist the countri have been made too hot to hold it sinc
the war the nativ stand in the proport of nearli twenti to on
to the white the boer were in their turn much more numer than the
english but the latter own nearli all the trade establish in
the countri and also a veri larg amount of properti
the transvaal boer have been veri much prais up by member of the
govern in england and other who ar anxiou to advanc their
interest as against english interest mr gladston inde can
hardli find word strong enough to express hi admir of their
leader those abl men sinc thei inflict a nation humili
on us and doubtless thei ar a peopl with mani good point that thei
ar not devoid of sagac can be seen by the wai thei have dealt with
the english govern
the boer ar certainli a peculiar peopl though thei can hardli be
said to be zealou of good work thei ar veri religi but their
religion take it colour from the darkest portion of the old testament
lesson of merci and gentl ar not at all to their like and thei
seldom care to read the gospel what thei delight in ar the stori of
wholesal butcheri by the israelit of old and in their own posit
thei find a reproduct of that of the first settler in the holi land
like them thei think thei ar entrust by the almighti with the task
of extermin the heathen nativ tribe around them and ar alwai
readi with a scriptur preced for slaughter and robberi the name of
the divin is continu on their lip sometim in connect with
veri doubt statement thei ar divid into three sect none of
which care much for the other two these ar the dopper who number
about half the popul the orthodox reform and the liber reform
which is the least numer of these three sect the dopper ar
by far the most uncompromis and difficult to deal with thei much
resembl the puritan of charl the first time of the extrem
hewagaginpiec stamp
it is difficult to agre with those who call the boer coward an
accus which the whole of their histori beli a boer doe not like
fight if he can avoid it becaus he set a high valu on hi own
life but if he is corner he will fight as well as anybodi els the
boer fought well enough in the late war though that it is true is
no great criterion of courag sinc thei were throughout flush with
victori and ow to the poor shoot of the british troop in but
littl person danger on veri unpleas characterist thei have
and that is an absenc of regard for the truth especi where land
is concern inde the nation characterist is crystallis into
a proverb i am no slave to my word it ha sever time happen to
me to see on set of highli respect wit in a land case go
into the box and swear distinctli that thei saw a beacon place on a
certain spot whilst an equal number on the other side will swear that
thei saw it place a mile awai fill as thei ar with a land hunger
to which that of the irish peasant is a weak and colourless sentiment
there is littl that thei will not do to gratifi their tast it is
the subject of constant litig amongst them and it is by no mean
uncommon for a boer to spend sever thousand pound in lawsuit over a
piec of land not worth as mani hundr
person boer ar fine men but as a rule ugli their womenfolk ar
goodlook in earli life but get veri stout as thei grow older thei
in common with most of their sex understand how to us their tongu
inde it is said that it wa the women who caus the rise against
the english govern none of the refin of civilis enter
into the life of an ordinari boer he live in a wai that would shock an
english labour at twentyf shill the week although he is veri
probabl worthi fifteen or twenti thousand pound hi home is but too
frequent squalid and filthi to an extraordinari degre he himself ha
no educ and doe not care that hi children should receiv ani
he live by himself in the middl of a great plot of land hi nearest
neighbour be perhap ten or twelv mile awai care but littl for
the new of the outsid world and noth for it opinion do veri
littl work but grow daili richer through the increas of hi flock
and herd hi expens ar almost noth and as he get older wealth
increas upon him the event in hi life consist of an occasion
trip on commando against some nativ tribe attend a few polit
meet and the journei he make with hi famili to the nearest
town some four time a year in order to be present at nachtmaal
or communion foreign especi englishmen he detest but he is
kindli and hospit to hi own peopl live isol as he doe
the lord of a littl kingdom he natur come to have a great idea of
himself and a correspond contempt for all the rest of mankind law
and tax ar thing distast to him and he look upon it as an
impertin that ani court should ventur to call him to account for
hi do he is rich and prosper and the care of poverti and all
the other troubl that fall to the lot of civilis men do not affect
him he ha no romanc in him nor ani of the higher feel and
aspir that ar found in almost everi other race in short
unlik the zulu he despis there is littl of the gentleman in hi
composit though he is at time capabl of act of kind and even
generos hi happi is to live alon in the great wilder with
hi children hi menserv and hi maidserv hi flock and hi
herd the monarch of all he survei if civilis press him too
close hi remedi is a simpl on he sell hi farm pack up hi
good and cash in hi waggon and start for region more congeni
wild such ar some of the lead characterist of that remark
product of south africa the transvaal boer who resembl no other
white man in the world
perhap howev the most strike of all hi odditi is hi
abhorr of all govern more especi if that govern be
carri out accord to english principl the boer have alwai been
more or less in rebellion thei rebel against the rule of the compani
when the cape belong to holland thei rebel against the english
govern in the cape thei were alwai in a state of semirebellion
against their own govern in the transvaal and now thei have for
the second time with the most complet success rebel against the
english govern the fact of the matter is that the bulk of their
number hate all govern becaus govern enforc law and order
and thei hate the english govern worst of all becaus it enforc
law and order most of all it is not liberti thei long for but
licens the sturdi independ of the boer resolv itself into a
determin not to have hi affair interf with by ani superior
power whatsoev and not to pai tax if he can possibl avoid it
but he ha also a specif caus of complaint against the english
govern which would alon caus him to do hi utmost to get rid of
it and that is it mode of deal with nativ which is radic
opposit to hi own thi is the secret of boer patriot to
understand it it must be rememb that the englishman and the boer
look at nativ from a differ point of view the englishman though
he mai not be veri fond of him at ani rate regard the kafir as a
fellow human be with feel like hi own the averag boer doe
not he look upon the black creatur as have been deliv into
hi hand by the lord for hi own purpos that is to shoot and
enslav he must not be blame too harshli for thi for besid
be natur of a somewhat hard disposit hatr of the nativ
is hereditari and is partli induc by the histori of mani a bloodi
struggl also the nativ hate the boer fulli as much as the boer hate
the nativ though with better reason now nativ labour is a necess
to the boer becaus he will not as a rule do hard manual labour
himself and there must be some on to plant and garner the crop and
herd the cattl on the other hand the nativ ar not anxiou to serv
the boer which mean littl or no pai and plenti of thick stick and
sometim wors the result of thi state of affair is that the boer
often ha to reli on forc labour to a veri great extent but thi is a
thing that an english govern will not toler and the consequ
is that under it rule he cannot get the labour that is necessari to
him
then there is the tax question if he live under the english flag the
monei ha to be paid regularli but under hi own govern he pai or
not as he like it wa thi habit of hi of refus payment of tax
that brought the republ into difficulti in 1877 and that will er
long bring it into troubl again he cannot understand that cash is
necessari to carri on a govern and look upon a tax as though it
were so much monei stolen from him these thing ar the real spring of
the sturdi independ and the patriot of the ordinari transvaal
farmer doubtless there ar some who ar realli patriot for
instanc on of their leader paul kruger but with the major
patriot is onli anoth word for unbound licens and forc labour
these remark must not be taken to appli to the cape boer who ar a
superior class of men sinc thei live under a settl and civilis
govern have been steadili improv whilst their cousin
live everi man for hi own hand have been deterior the old
voortrekk the father and grandfath of the transvaal boer of
todai were without doubt a veri fine set of men and occasion
you mai in the transvaal meet individu of the same stamp whom it is a
pleasur to know but these ar gener men of a certain ag with some
experi of the world the younger men ar veri objection in their
manner
the real dutch patriot parti is not to be found in the transvaal but
in the cape coloni their object which as affair now ar is well
within the bound of possibl is by fair mean or foul to swamp
the english element in south africa and to establish a great dutch
republ it wa thi parti which consist of clever and well educ
men who rais the outcri against the transvaal annex becaus it
meant an enorm extens of english influenc and who had the wit
by mean of their emissari and newspap to work upon the feel of
the ignor transvaal farmer until thei persuad them to rebel and
final to avail themselv of the yearn of english radic for
the disrupt of the empir and the minimis of british author
to get the annex cancel all through thi busi the boer
have more or less danc in obedi to string pull at cape town
and it is now said that on of the chief wirepul mr hofmey is
to be ask to becom presid of the republ these men ar the real
patriot of south africa and veri clever on too not the transvaal
boer who vapour about their blood and their countri and the accurs
englishman to order and ar in realiti influenc by veri small
motiv such as the desir to avoid payment of tax or to hunt awai
a neighbour englishman whose civilis and refin ar as
offens as hi farm is desir such ar the dutch inhabit of
the transvaal i will now give a short sketch of their institut as
thei were befor the annex and to which the commun ha revert
sinc it recis with i believ but few alter
the form of govern is republican and to all intent and purpos
manhood suffrag prevail suprem power rest in the peopl the
execut power of the state centr in a presid elect by the
peopl to hold offic for a term of five year everi voter have a
voic in hi elect he is assist in the execut of hi duti by
an execut council consist of the state secretari and such other
three member as ar select for that purpos by the legisl bodi
the volksraad the state secretari hold offic for four year and is
elect by the volksraad the member of the execut all have seat in
the volksraad but have no vote the volksraad is the legisl bodi
of the state and consist of fortytwo member the countri is divid
into twelv elector district each of which ha the right to return
three member the gold field have also the right of elect two
member and the four princip town on member each there is
no power in the state compet to either prorogu or dissolv the
volksraad except that bodi itself so that an appeal to the countri on
a given subject or polici is imposs without it concurr member
ar elect for four year but half retir by rotat everi two year
the vacanc be fill by reelect member must have been
voter for three year and be not less than thirti year of ag must
belong to a protest church be resid in the countri and owner
of immov properti therein a father and son cannot sit in the same
raad neither can seat be occupi by colour person bastard or
offici
for each elector district there is a magistr or landdrost whose
duti ar similar to those of a civil commission these district ar
again subdivid into ward presid over by field cornet who exercis
judici power in minor matter and in time of war have consider
author the roman dutch law is the common law of the countri as it
is of the coloni of the cape of good hope and natal and of the orang
free state
prior to the annex justic wa administ in a veri primit
fashion first there wa the landdrost court from which an appeal
lai to a court consist of the landdrost and six councillor elect
by the public thi wa a court of first instanc as well as a court of
appeal then there wa a suprem court consist of three landdrost
from three differ district and a juri of twelv select from the
burgher of the state there wa no appeal from thi court but case
have sometim been brought under the consider of the volksraad
as the suprem power it is easi to imagin what the administr
of justic wa like when the presid of all the law court in the
countri were elect by the mob not on account of their knowledg of
the law but becaus thei were popular suitor befor the old transvaal
court found the law surprisingli uncertain a high court of justic
wa howev establish after the annex and ha been continu
by the volksraad but an agit is be got up against it and it
will possibl be abolish in favour of the old system
in such a commun as that of the transvaal boer the question of
public defenc wa evid of the first import thi is provid
for under what is known as the commando system the presid with the
concurr of the execut council ha the right of declar war
and of call up a commando in which the burgher ar place under
the field cornet and command these last ar chosen by the field
cornet for each district and a commandantgener is chosen by the
whole laager or forc but the presid is the commanderinchief of
the armi all the inhabit of the state between sixteen and sixti
with a few except ar liabl for servic young men under
eighteen and men over fifti ar onli call out under circumst
of emerg member of the volksraad offici clergymen and
schoolteach ar exempt from person servic unless martial law
is proclaim but must contribut an amount not exceed 15 pound
toward the expens of the war all legal proceed in civil case ar
suspend against person on commando no summons can be made out
and as soon as martial law is proclaim no legal execut can be
prosecut the pound ar close and transfer due payment ar
suspend until after thirti dai from the recal of the proclam
of martial law owner of land resid beyond the border of the
republ ar also liabl in addit to the ordinari war tax to
place a fit and proper substitut at the dispos of the govern or
otherwis to pai a fine of 15 pound the first levi of the burgher
is of men from eighteen to thirtyfour year of ag the second
thirtyfour to fifti and the third from sixteen to eighteen and
from fifti to sixti year everi man is bound to provid himself with
cloth a gun and ammunit and there must be enough waggon and
oxen found between them to suffic for their joint us of the booti
taken on quarter goe to govern and the rest to the burgher the
most disagre part of the command system is howev yet to
come person servic is not all that the resid in the transvaal
republ ha to endur the right is vest in field cornet to
command articl as well as individu and to call upon inhabit
to furnish requisit for the commando as mai be imagin it goe veri
hard on these occas with the properti of ani individu whom the
field cornet mai not happen to like
each ward is expect to turn out it conting readi and equip
for war and thi can onli be done by seiz good right and left on
unfortun will have to find a waggon anoth to deliv hi favourit
span of trek oxen anoth hi ridinghors or some slaughter cattl
and so on even when the offic make the levi is desir of do
hi duti as fairli as he can it is obviou that veri great hardship
must be inflict under such a system requisit ar made more with
regard to what is want than with a view to an equit distribut
of demand and like the jew in the time of the crusad he who
ha got most must pai most or take the consequ which mai be
unpleas articl which ar not perish such as waggon ar
suppos to be return but if thei come back at all thei ar gener
worthless
in case of war the nativ tribe live within the border of the state
ar also expect to furnish conting and it is on them that most of
the hard work of the campaign gener fall thei ar put in the front
of the battl and have to do the handtohand fight which howev
if of the zulu race thei do not object to
the revenu of the state is so arrang that the burden of it should
fall as much as possibl on the trade commun and as littl as
possibl on the farmer it is chiefli deriv from licens on trade
profess and call 30 per annum quitrent on farm transfer
due and stamp auction due court fee and contribut from such
nativ tribe as can be made to pai them sinc we have given up the
countri the volksraad ha put a veri heavi tax on all import good
hope therebi to beguil the boer into pai tax without know
it and at the same time strike a blow at the trade commun which
is english in it procliv the result ha been to paralys
what littl trade there wa left in the countri and to caus great
dissatisfact amongst the farmer who cannot understand why now that
the english ar gone thei should have to pai twice as much for their
sugar and coffe as thei have been accustom to do
i will conclud thi chapter with a few word about the nativ who
swarm in and around the transvaal thei can be roughli divid into two
great race the amazulu and their offshoot and the macate or basutu
tribe all those of zulu blood includ the swazi mapock kafir
the matabel the knobnod and other ar veri warlik in disposit
and men of fine physiqu the basutu who must not be confound with
the cape basutu howev differ from these tribe in everi respect
includ their languag which is call sisutu the onli mutual
feel between the two race be their common detest of the
boer thei do not love war in fact thei ar timid and cowardli by
natur and onli fight when thei ar oblig to unlik the zulu thei
ar much addict to the art of peac show consider capac
for civilis and ar even will to becom christian there would
have been a far better field for the missionari in the transvaal than in
zululand and natal inde the most success mission station i have
seen in africa is near middelburg under the control of mr merenski
in person the basutu ar thin and weakli when compar to the stalwart
zulu and it is their conscious of inferior both to the white
men and their black brethren that togeth with their natur
timid make them submit as easili as thei do to the yoke of the
boer

he onc inform me on a farm herd sheep he afterward becam

prove too broad for hi congreg he resign hi cure and in an
evil moment for himself took to polit

he possess howev a mind of that peculiarli volatil order that is

then suddenli discov that the countri refus to support him in
short he wa made of a veri differ clai to that of the peopl he had

bai railwai thei on the other hand care noth about republ or
railwai but fix their affect on forc labour and get rid of
the necess of pai taxesand so between them the republ came
to grief but it must be born in mind that presid burger wa
throughout actuat by good motiv he did hi best by a stubborn and
stiffneck peopl and if he fail as fail he did it wa more their
fault than hi as regard the pension he receiv from the english
govern which ha so often been brought up against him it wa
after all no more than hi due after five year of arduou work if the
republ had continu to exist it is to be presum that thei would
have made some provis for their old presid more especi as
he seem to have exhaust hi privat mean in pai the debt of
the countri whatev mai be said of some of the other offici of the
republ it presid wa i believ an honest man
in 1875 mr burger proceed to europ have he sai in a
posthum document recent publish been empow by the volksraad
to carri out my plan for the develop of the countri by open up
a direct commun for it free from the trammel of british port
and influenc accord to thi document dure hi absenc two
power parti viz the faction of unprincipl fortunehunt
rascal and runawai on the on hand and the faction of the extrem
orthodox parti in a certain branch of the dutch reform church on the
other began to cooper against the govern of the republ and
me person ill as i wa and contrari to the advic of my
medic men i proceed to europ in the begin of 1875 to carri
out my project and no sooner wa my back turn on the transvaal than
the conspir element began to act the new coat of arm and flag
adopt in the raad by an almost unanim vote were abolish the law
for a free and secular educ were tamper with and my resist
to a reckless inspect and dispos of govern land still
occupi by nativ wa openli defi the raad fill up to a larg
extent with men of ill reput who under the cloak of progress and
favour to the govern view obtain their seat wa too weak to
cope with the skill of the conspir and grant leav to the act
presid to carri out measur diametr oppos to my polici
nativ land were inspect and given out to a few specul who
held larg number of claim to land which were destin for citizen
and so a war wa prepar for me on my return from europ which i
could not avert thi extract is interest as show the state of
feel exist between the presid and hi offic previou to the
outbreak of the secocoeni war it also show how entir he wa out of
sympathi with the citizen see that as soon as hi back wa turn
thei with mr joubert and paul kruger at their head at onc undid all
the littl good he had done
when mr burger got to england he found that citi capitalist would
have noth whatev to sai to hi railwai scheme in holland howev
he succeed in get 90000 pound of the 300000 pound he wish to
borrow at a high rate of interest and by pass a bond on five hundr
govern farm thi monei wa immedi invest in a railwai
plant which when it arriv at delagoa bai had to be mortgag to
pai the freight on it and that wa the end of the delagoa bai railwai
scheme except that the 90000 pound is i believ still ow to the
confid sharehold in holland
on hi return to the transvaal the presid wa well receiv and for
a month or so all went smoothli but the relat of the republ with
the surround nativ tribe had by thi time becom so bad that an
explos wa immin somewher in the year 1874 the volksraad rais
the price of pass under the iniquit pass law by which everi nativ
travel through the territori wa made to pai from 1 pound to five
pound in case of nonpay the nativ wa made subject to a fine of
from 1 pound to 10 pound and to a beat of from ten to twentyf
lash he wa also to go into servic for three month and have a
certif thereof for which he must pai five shill the avow
object of the law be to obtain a suppli of kafir labour thi wa
done in spite of the earnest protest of the presid who gave the raad
distinctli to understand that by accept thi law thei would in point
of fact annul treati conclud with the chief on the southwestern
border it wa not clear howev if thi amend pass law ever came
into forc it is to be hope it did not for even under the old law
nativ were shamefulli treat by the boer who would pretend that
thei were authoris by the govern to collect the tax the result
be that the unfortun kafir wa frequent oblig to pai twice
over nativ had such a horror of the pass law of the countri that
when travel to the diamond field to work thei would frequent go
round some hundr of mile rather than pass through the transvaal
that the volksraad should have thought it necessari to enact such a law
in order that the farmer should obtain a suppli of kafir labour in a
territori that had nearli a million of nativ inhabit who unlik
the zulu ar will to work if onli thei meet with decent treatment
is in itself an instruct commentari on the feel exist between
the boer master and kafir servant
but besid the gener quarrel with the kafir race in it entireti
which the boer alwai have on hand thei had just then sever
individu differ in each of which there lurk the possibl
of disturb
to begin with their relat with cetywayo were by no mean amic
dure mr burger absenc the boer govern then under the
leadership of p j joubert sent cetywayo a veri stern messagea
messag that give the reader the idea that mr joubert wa readi to
enforc it with ten thousand men after make variou statement and
demand with refer to the amaswazi tribe the disput boundari
line c it end thu
although the govern of the south african republ ha never wish
and doe not now desir that seriou disaffect and animos
should exist between you and them yet it is not the less of the
greatest consequ and import for you earnestli to weigh these
matter and risk and to satisfi them the more so if you on your side
also wish that peac and friendship shall be maintain between you and
us
the secretari for nativ affair for natal comment on thi messag in
these word the tone of thi messag to cetywayo is not veri friendli
it ha the look of an ultimatum and if the govern of the transvaal
were in circumst differ to what it is the messag would
suggest an intent to coerc if the demand it convei ar not at onc
compli with but i am inclin to the opinion that no such intent
exist and that the transmiss of a copi of the messag to the natal
govern is intend as a notif that the transvaal govern
ha proclaim the territori hitherto in disput between it and the
zulu to be republican territori and that the republ intend to
occupi it
in the territori mark out by a decis known as the keat award
in which lieutenantgovernor keat of natal at the request of both
parti laid down the boundari line between the boer and certain
nativ tribe the boer govern carri it with a yet higher
hand insomuch as the nativ of those district be compar
unwarlik were less like to resist
on the 18th august 1875 act presid joubert issu a proclam
by which a line wa laid down far to the southward of that mark out by
mr keat and consequ includ more territori within the elast
boundari of the republ a govern notic of the same date invit
all claim land now declar to belong to the republ to send in
their claim to be settl by a land commiss
on the 6th march 1876 anoth chief in the same neighbourhood
montsoia write to the lieutenantgovernor of griqualand west in these
term
my friendi wish to acquaint you with the do of some peopl
connect with the boer a manserv of mine ha been sever
injur in the head by on of the boer servant which ha prove
fatal anoth of my peopl ha been cruelli treat by a boer ty a
rein about hi neck and then mount hi hors and drag him about
the place my brother molema who is the bearer of thi will give you
full particular
molema explain the assault thu the assault man is not dead hi
skull wa fractur the assault wa commit by a boer name wessel
badenhorst who shamefulli illtreat the man beat him till he
faint and on hi reviv fasten a rim around hi neck and
made him run to the homestead by the side of hi badenhorst hors
canter at the homestead he ti him to the waggonwheel and flog
him again till mr badenhorst stop her husband
though it will be seen that the boer were on good term neither with
the zulu nor the keat award nativ thei still had on kafir alli
name umbandeni the amaswazi king thi allianc wa conclud
under circumst so peculiar that thei ar worthi of a brief
recapitul it appear that in the winter of the year 1875 mr
rudolph the landdrost of utrecht went to swazieland and imit
the exampl of the natal govern with cetywayo crown umbandeni
king on behalf of the boer govern he further made a treati of
allianc with him and promis him a commando to help him in case
of hi be attack by the zulu now come the curiou part of the
stori on the 18th mai 1876 a messag came from thi same umbandeni to
sir h bulwer of which the follow is an extractw ar sent by
our king to thank the govern of natal for the inform sent to
him last winter by that govern and convei by mr rudolph of the
intend attack on hi peopl by the zulu we ar further instruct by
the king to thank the natal govern for the influenc it us to
stop the intend raid and for instruct a boer commando to go to
hi countri to render him assist in case of need and further
for appoint mr randolph at the head of the commando to place him
umbandeni as king over the amaswazi and to make a treati with him and
hi peopl on behalf of the natal govern the transvaal
govern ha ask umbandeni to acknowledg himself a subject of the
republ but he ha distinctli refus to do so in a minut written
on thi subject the secretari for nativ affair for natal sai no
explan or assur wa suffici to convinc them umbandeni
messeng that thei had on that occas made themselv subject
of the south african republ thei declar it wa not their wish or
intent to do so and that thei would refus to acknowledg a posit
into which thei had been unwittingli betrai i must conclud thi
episod by quot the last paragraph of sir h bulwer cover
despatch becaus it concern larger issu than the suppos treati
it will not be necessari that i should at present add ani remark to
those contain in the minut for the secretari for nativ affair but
i would observ that the situat aris out of the relat of the
govern of the south african republ with the neighbour state is
so complic and present so mani element of confus and of danger
to the peac of thi portion of south africa that i trust some wai
mai be found to an earli settlement of question that ought not in my
opinion to be left alon as so mani have been left to take the chanc
of the futur
and now i come to the last and most immin nativ difficulti that at
the time face the republ on the border of lydenburg district there
live a power chief name secocoeni between thi chief and the
transvaal govern difficulti aros in the begin of 1876 on the
usual subjectland the boer declar that thei had bought the land
from the swazi who had conquer portion of the countri and
that the swazi offer to make it clean from brambl ie kill
everybodi live on it but that thei the boer said that thei were
to let them be that thei might be their servant the basutu on the
other hand said that no such sale ever took place and even if it did
take place it wa invalid becaus the swazi were not in occup
of the land and therefor could not sell it it wa a christian kafir
call johann a brother of secocoeni who wa the immedi caus
of the war thi johann us to live at a place call botsobelo
the missionst of mr merenski but move to a stronghold on the
spekboom river in the disput territori the boer sent to him to come
back but he refus and warn the boer off hi land secocoeni wa
then appeal to but declar that the land belong to hi tribe and
would be occupi by johann he also told the boer that he did not
wish to fight but that he wa quit readi to do so if thei prefer
it thereupon the transvaal govern declar war although it doe
not appear that the nativ commit ani outrag or act of hostil
befor the declar as regard the boer right to secocoeni
countri sir h barkli sum up the question thu in a despatch
address to presid burger date 28th nov 1876on the whole it
seem perfectli clear and i feel bound to repeat it that sikukuni
wa neither de jure or de facto a subject of the republ when your
honour declar war against him in june last as soon as war had been
declar the clumsi commando system wa set work and about
2500 white men collect the swazi also were appli to to send a
conting which thei did be onli too glad of the opportun of
slaughter
at first all went well and the presid who accompani the commando
in person succeed in reduc a mountain stronghold which in hi
highflown wai he call a gloriou victori over a kafir gibraltar
on the 14th juli anoth engag took place when the boer and
swazi attack johann stronghold the place wa taken with
circumst of great barbar by the swazi for when the signal
wa given to advanc the boer did not move nearli all the women were
kill and the brain of the children were dash out against the
stone in on instanc befor the captiv mother face johann wa
badli wound and di two dai afterward when he wa dy he said
to hi brother i am go to die i am thank i do not die by the
hand of these cowardli boer but by the hand of a black and courag
nation like myself he then took leav of hi peopl told hi
brother to read the bibl and expir the swazi were so infuri
at the cowardic displai by the boer on thi occas that thei
return home in great dudgeon
on the 2nd of august secocoeni mountain which is a veri strong
fortif wa attack in two column or rather an attempt wa
made to attack it for when it came to the pinch onli about forti men
mostli english and german would advanc thereupon the whole commando
retreat with great hast the greater part of it go straight home
in vain the presid entreat them to shoot him rather than desert
him thei had had enough of secocoeni and hi stronghold and home thei
went the presid then retreat with what few men he had left to
steelport where he built a fort and from thenc return to pretoria
the new of the collaps of the commando wa receiv throughout the
transvaal and inde the whole of south africa with the greatest
dismai for the first time in the histori of that countri the white man
had been complet worst by a nativ tribe and that tribe wretch
basutu peopl whom the zulu call their dog it wa glad tide to
everi nativ from the zambesi to the cape who learnt therebi that
the white man wa not so invinc as he us to be meanwhil the
inhabit of lydenburg were fill with alarm and again and again
petit the governor of the cape and natal for assist their
fear were howev to a great extent groundless for with the
except of occasion cattlelift secocoeni did not follow up hi
victori
on the 4th septemb the presid open the special sit of the
volksraad and present to that bodi a scheme for the establish of
a border forc to take the place of the commando system announc that
he had appoint a certain captain von schlickmann to command it he
also request the raad to make some provis for the expens of the
expedit which thei had omit to do in their former sit
captain von schlickmann determin to carri on the war upon a differ
system he got togeth a band of veri rough charact on the diamond
field and occupi the fort built by the presid from whenc he
would salli out from time to time and destroi kraal he seem if
we mai believ the report in the blue book and the stori of
eyewit to have carri on hi proceed in a somewhat savag
wai the follow is an extract from a privat letter written by on of
hi volunt
about daylight we came across four kafir saw them first and charg
in front of them to cut off their retreat saw thei were women and
call out not to fire in spite of that on of the poor thing got her
head blown off a dd shame afterward two women and a babi
were brought to the camp prison the same night thei were taken out
by our kafir and murder in cold blood by the order of mr
and myself strongli protest against it but without avail i never
heard such a cowardli piec of busi in my life no good will come
of it you mai depend sai he would cut all the women and
children throat he catch told him distinctli he wa a dd
coward
schlickmann wa howev a mildmann man when compar to a certain
abel erasmu afterward denounc at a public dinner by sir garnet
wolselei as a fiend in human form thi gentleman in the month of
octob attack a friendli kraal of kafir the incid is describ
thu in a correspond letter
the peopl of the kraal taken quit by surpris fled when thei saw
their foe and most of them took shelter in the neighbour bush two
or three men were distinctli seen in their flight from the kraal and
on of them is known to have been wound accord to my inform the
remaind were women and children who were pursu into the bush and
there all shiver and shriek were put to death by the boer
kafir some be shot but the major stab with assegai after
the massacr he count thirteen women and three children but he sai
he did not see the bodi of a singl man anoth kafir said point to
a place in the road where the stone were thickli strewn the bodi
of the women and children lai like these stone the boer befor
mention who ha been station outsid ha told on of hi own
friend whom he thought would not mention it that the shriek were
fear to hear
sever account of or allus to thi atroc can be found in the
blue book and i mai add that it in common with other of the same
stamp wa the talk of the countri at the time
i do not relat these horror out of ani wish to rake up old stori to
the prejudic of the boer but becaus i am describ the state of
the countri befor the annex in which thei form an interest and
import item also it is as well that peopl in england should know
into what hand thei have deliv over the nativ tribe who trust
in their protect what happen in 1876 is probabl happen again
now and will certainli happen again and again the charact of the
transvaal boer and hi sentiment toward the nativ race have not
modifi dure the last five year but on the contrari a larg
amount of energi which ha been accumul dure the period of
british protect will now be expend on their devot head
as regard the truth of these atroc the major of them ar
beyond the possibl of doubt inde to the best of my knowledg no
seriou attempt ha ever been made to refut such of them as have come
into public notic except in a gener wai for parti purpos as
howev thei mai be doubt i will quot the follow extract from a
despatch written by sir h barkli to lord carnarvon date 18th decemb
1876
as von schlickmann ha sinc fallen fight brave it is not without
reluct that i join in affix thi dark stain on hi memori but
truth compel me to add the follow extract from a letter which i have
sinc receiv from on whose name which i commun to your lordship
privat forbid disbelief there is no longer the slightest doubt
as to the murder of the two women and the child at steelport by the
direct order of schlickmann and in the attack on the kraal near which
these women were captur or some attack about that period he order
hi men to cut the throat of all the wound thi is no mere report
it is posit true he conclud by express a hope that the
cours of event will enabl her majesti govern to take such step
as will termin thi wanton and useless bloodsh and prevent
the recurr of the scene of injustic cruelti and rapin which
abund evid is everi dai forthcom to prove have rare ceas
to disgrac the republ beyond the vaal ever sinc thei first sprang
into exist
the ital ar my ownauthor
these ar strong word but none too strong for the fact of the case
injustic cruelti and rapin have alwai been the watchword of the
transvaal boer the stori of wholesal slaughter in the earlier
dai of the republ ar veri numer on of the best known of those
shock occurr took place in the zoutpansberg war in 1865 on thi
occas a larg number of kafir took refug in cave where the boer
smoke them to death some year afterward dr wangeman whose account
is i believ thoroughli reliabl describ the scene of their
oper in these word
the roof of the first cave wa black with smoke the remain of the
log which were burnt lai at the entranc the floor wa strewn with
hundr of skull and skeleton in confus heap lai kaross
kerri assegai pot spoon snuffbox and the bone of men
give on the impress that thi wa the grave of a whole peopl
some estim the number of those who perish here from twenti to
thirti thousand thi is i believ too high in the on chamber there
were from two hundr to three hundr skeleton the other chamber i
did not visit
in 1868 a public meet wa held at potchefstroom to consid the war
then go on with the zoutpansberg nativ accord to the report of
the proceed the rev mr ludorf said that on a particular occas
a number of nativ children who were too young to be remov had been
collect in a heap cover with long grass and burn aliv other
atroc had also been commit but these were too horribl to
relat when call upon to produc hi author for thi statement
mr ludorf name hi author in a solemn declar to the state
attornei at thi same meet mr j g steyn who had been landdrost
of potchefstroom said there now wa innoc blood on our hand which
had not yet been aveng and the curs of god rest on the land in
consequ mr rosalt remark that it wa a singular circumst
that in the differ coloni kafir war as also in the basutu war
on did not hear of destitut children be found by the commando
and ask how it wa that everi petti commando that took the field in
thi republ invari found number of destitut children he gave
it as hi opinion that the present system of apprenticeship wa an
essenti caus of our frequent hostil with the nativ mr jan
talyard said children were forcibl taken from their parent and were
then call destitut and apprent mr daniel van nooren wa
heard to sai if thei had to clear the countri and could not have the
children thei found he would shoot them mr fieldcornet furstenburg
state that when he wa at zoutpansberg with hi burgher the chief
katsekat wa told to come down from the mountain that he sent on of
hi subordin as a proof of amiti that whilst a delai of five dai
wa guarante by command paul kruger who wa then in command
order were given at the same time to attack the nativ at break of
dai which wa accordingli done but which result in total failur
truli thi must have been an interest meet
befor leav these unsavouri subject i must touch on the question of
slaveri it ha been again and again deni on behalf of the transvaal
boer that slaveri exist in the republ now thi is strictli
speak true slaveri did not exist but apprenticeship didth rose
wa call by anoth name that is all the poor destitut children who
were pick up by kindheart boer after the extermin of their
parent were apprent to farmer till thei came of ag it is a
remark fact that these children never attain their major you
might meet oldish men in the transvaal who were not accord to their
master reckon twentyon year of ag the assert that slaveri
did not exist in the transvaal is onli made to hoodwink the english
public i have known men who have own slave and who have seen whole
waggonload of black ivori as thei were call sold for about 15
pound apiec i have at thi moment a tenant carolu by name on some
land i own in natal now a welltodo man who wa for mani yearsabout
twenti if i rememb righta boer slave dure those year he told
me he work from morn till night and the onli reward he receiv
wa two calv he final escap into natal
if other evid is need it is not difficult to find so i will quot
a littl on the 22d august 1876 we find khama king of the bamangwato

custom of the boer ha alwai been to caus peopl to be sold and
todai thei ar still sell peopl last year i saw them pass with
two waggon full of peopl whom thei had bought at the river at tanan

the special correspond of the cape argu a highli respect

thi inform wa glean ha furnish besid some fact which mai

an imperi commiss he let fall on or two incid of the past
which were brought to mind by the occurr of the present in 1864
he sai the swazi accompani the boer against male the boer did
noth but stand by and wit the fear massacr the men and women
were also murder on poor woman sat clutch her babi of eight dai
old the swazi stab her through the bodi and when she found that
she could not live she wrung the babi neck with her own hand to save
it from futur miseri on the return of that commando the children who
becam too weari to continu the journei were kill on the road the
survivor were sold as slave to the farmer
the same gentleman write in the issu of the 12th decemb
as followsth whole world mai know it for it is true and
investig will onli bring out the horribl detail that through the
whole cours of thi republ exist it ha act in contravent
of the sand river treati and slaveri ha occur not onli here and
there in isol case but as an unbroken practic and ha been
on of the peculiar institut of the countri mix up with all it
social and polit life it ha been at the root of most of it war
it ha been carri on regularli even in time of peac it ha been
characteris by all those circumst which have so often rous
the british nation to an indign protest and to repeat effort to
banish the slave trade from the world the boer have not onli fallen
on unsuspect kraal simpli for the purpos of obtain the women and
children and cattl but thei have carri on a traffic through nativ
who have kidnap the children of their weaker neighbour and sold
them to the white man again the boer have sold and exchang their
victim among themselv waggonload of slave have been convei
from on end of the countri to the other for sale and that with the
cognis of and for the direct advantag of the highest offici of
the land the writer ha himself seen in a town situat in the south
of the republ the children who had been brought down from a remot
northern district on fine morn in walk through the street
he wa struck with the number of littl black stranger stand about
certain hous and wonder where thei could have come from he learnt
a few hour later that thei were part of load which were dispos of
on the outskirt of the town the dai befor the circumst connect
with some of these kidnap excurs ar appal and the
barbar practis by cruel master upon some of these defenceless
creatur dure the cours of their servitud ar scarc less
horribl than those report from turkei it is no disgrac in thi
countri for an offici to ride a fine hors which wa got for two kafir
children to procur whom the father and mother were shot no reproach
is inherit by the mistress who dai after dai ti up her femal
servant in an agonis postur and had her beaten until there wa no
sound part in her bodi secur her in the stock dure the interv
of tortur that man did not lose cast who ti up anoth woman and
had her thrash until she brought forth at the whippingpost these
ar mere exampl of thousand of case which could be prove were
an imperi commiss to sit and could the wretch victim of a
prolong oppress recov suffici from the dread of their old
tyrant to give a truth report
to come to some evid more recent adduc on the 9th mai 1881 an
affidavit wa sworn to by the rev john thorn curat of st john the
evangelist lydenburg transvaal and present to the royal commiss
appoint to settl transvaal affair in which he statesthat i
wa appoint to the charg of a congreg in potchefstroom about
thirteen year ago when the republ wa under the presid of mr
pretoriu i rememb notic on morn as i walk through
the street a number of young nativ whom i knew to be stranger
i inquir where thei came from i wa told that thei had just been
brought from zoutpansberg thi wa the local from which slave were
chiefli brought at that time and were trade for under the name of
black ivori on of these nativ belong to mr munich the state
attornei it wa a matter of common remark at that time that the
presid of the republ wa himself on of the greatest dealer in
slave in the fourth paragraph of the same affidavit mr thorn sai
that the rev doctor nachtig of the berlin missionari societi wa
the interpret for shatan peopl in the privat offic of mr roth
and at the close of the interview told me what had occur on my
express surpris he went on to relat that he had inform on
nativ matter which would surpris me more he then produc the
copi of a regist kept in the landdrost offic of men women and
children to the number of four hundr and eighti 480 who had been
dispos of by on boer to anoth for a consider in on case an
ox wa given in exchang in anoth goat in a third a blanket and
so forth mani of these nativ he mr nachtig knew person the
copi wa certifi as true and correct by an offici of the republ
and i would mention hi name now onli that i am persuad that it would
cost the man hi life if hi act becam known to the boer
on of the famou triumvir
on the 16th mai 1881 a nativ name frederick molepo wa examin by
the royal commiss the follow ar extract from hi examin
sir e wood ar you a christiany
sir h de villier how long were you a slavehalf a year
how do you know that you were a slave might you not have been an
apprenticeno i wa not apprent
how do you knowthei got me from my parent and illtreat me
sir e wood how mani time did you get the stickeveri dai
sir h de villier what did the boer do with you when thei caught
youthei sold me
how much did thei sell you foron cow and a big pot
on the 28th mai 1881 amongst the other document hand in for the
consider of the royal commiss is the statement of a headman
whose name it ha been consid advis to omit in the blue book for
fear the boer should take vengeanc on him he sai i sai that if
the english govern di i shall die too i would rather die than be
under the boer govern i am the man who help to make brick for
the church you see now stand in the squar here pretoria as a
slave without payment as a repres of my peopl i am still
obedi to the english govern and will to obei all command
from them even to die for their caus in thi countri rather than
submit to the boer
i wa under shambok my chief who fought the boer formerli but he
left us and we were put up to auction and sold among the boer i
want to state thi myself to the royal commiss in newcastl i wa
bought by fritz botha and sold by frederick botha who wa then veld
cornet justic of the peac of the boer
i have taken the liberti to quot all these extract
exactli as thei stand in the origin instead of weav
their substanc into my narr in order that i mai not
be accus as so often happen to author who write upon
thi subject of have present a garbl version of the
truth the origin of everi extract is to be found in blue
book present to parliament i have thought it best to
confin myself to these and avoid repeat stori of
cruelti and slaveri howev well authent that have
come to my knowledg privat such stori be alwai
more or less open to suspicion
it would be easi to find more report of the slavetrad practic of
the boer but as the abov ar fair sampl it will not be necessari
to do so my reader will be abl from them to form some opinion as to
whether or not slaveri or apprenticeship exist in the transvaal if
thei come to the conclus that it did it must be born in mind that
what exist in the past will certainli exist again in the futur
nativ ar not now ani fonder of work for boer than thei were a few
year back and boer must get labour somehow if on the other hand
it did not exist then the boer ar a grossli slander peopl and
all writer on the subject from livingston down have combin to take
awai their charact
leav nativ question for the present we must now return to the
gener affair of the countri when presid burger open the
special sit of the volksraad on the 4th septemb he appeal
it will be rememb to that bodi for pecuniari aid to liquid the
expens of the war thi appeal wa respond to by the pass of a
war tax under which everi owner of a farm wa to pai 10 pound the
owner of half a farm 5 pound and so on the tax wa not a veri just
on sinc it fell with equal weight on the rich man who held twenti
farm and the poor man who held but on it justic or injustic wa
howev to a great extent immateri sinc the free and independ
burgher includ some of the member of the volksraad who had impos
it promptli refus to pai it or inde whilst thei were about it
ani other tax as the treasuri wa alreadi empti and creditor were
press thi refus wa most illtim and thing began to look veri
black inde meanwhil in addit to the ordinari expenditur

schlickmann volunt as there wa no cash in the countri thi wa
done by issu govern promissori note known as goodfor or

bank refus to discount them and in some case the neighbour
coloni had to advanc monei to the transvaal postcart contractor
who were carri the mail as a matter of chariti the govern even
mortgag the great saltpan near pretoria for the paltri sum of 400
pound whilst the lead offici of the govern were driven
to pledg their own privat credit in order to obtain the smallest
articl necessari to it continu in fact to such a pass did thing
come that when the countri wa annex a singl threepenni bit which
had doubtless been overlook wa found in the treasuri chest togeth
with acknowledg of debt to the extent of nearli 300000 pound
nor wa the refus to pai tax which thei were powerless to enforc
the onli difficulti with which the govern had to contend want of
monei is as bad and pain a thing to a state as to an individu but
there ar perhap wors thing than want of monei on of which is to be
desert by your own friend and household thi wa the posit of the
govern of the republ no sooner wa it involv in overwhelm
difficulti than it own subject commenc to bait it more especi
the english portion of it subject thei complain to the english
author about the command of member of their famili or good
thei petit the british govern to interfer and gener made
themselv as unpleas as possibl to the local author such a
cours of action wa perhap natur but it can hardli be said to be
either quit logic or just the transvaal govern had never ask
them to come and live in the countri and if thei did so it must be
rememb that mani of the agit had accumul properti to leav
which would mean ruin and thei saw that unless someth wa done it
valu would be destroi

of demarc between dutch and english it is not so broad but that
a victori nation like the zulu might cross it and begin by
fight the boer might end by fight the white man irrespect of

a combin of nativ tribe against the white and how easili such
a combin might at that time have been brought about in the first
flush of nativ success he will understand the anxieti with which all
think men watch the cours of event in the transvaal in 1876
at last thei took such a seriou turn that the home govern saw that
some action must be taken if the catastroph wa to be avert and
determin to despatch sir theophilu shepston as special commission
to the transvaal with power should it be necessari to annex the

that the annex wa a triumph of mind over matter is quit true but
whether or not that triumph wa unworthili obtain i will leav those
who read thi short chronicl of the event connect with it to judg
i saw it somewhat darkli remark in a newspap the other dai that the
histori of the annex had evid yet to be written and i fear
that the remark repres the feel of most peopl about the
event impli as it did that it wa carri out by mean certainli
mysteri and presum doubt i am afraid that those who think
thu will be disappoint in what i have to sai about the matter sinc
i know that the mean emploi to bring the boer
fracti bello fatisqu repulsi
under her majesti author were throughout as fair and honest as the
annex itself wa in my opinion right and necessari
to return to sir t shepston he undoubtedli had fault as a ruler
on of the most promin of which wa that hi natur mild of
charact would never allow him to act with sever even when sever
wa necessari the veri crimin condemn to death ran a good chanc
of repriev when he had to sign their deathwarr he had also
that worst of fault so call in on fit by natur to becom
greatwant of ambit a fail that in such a man mark him the
possessor of an even and a philosoph mind it wa no seek of hi
own that rais him out of obscur and when hi work wa done to
compar obscur he elect to return though whether a man of hi
abil and experi in south african affair should at the present
crisi be allow to remain there is anoth question
on the 20th decemb 1876 sir t shepston wrote to presid burger

messr henderson and osborn on behalf of the special commission and
messr kruger and jorissen on behalf of the transvaal govern to
discuss the state of the countri thi commiss came to noth and
wa on both side noth more than a bit of byplai
the arriv of the mission wa necessarili regard with mix feel
by the inhabit of the transvaal by on parti it wa eagerli
greet viz the english section of the popul who devoutli
hope that it had come to annex the countri with the except of the
holland element the offici also were glad of it arriv and
secretli hope that the countri would be taken over when there would be
more chanc of their get their arrear pai the better educ boer
also were for the most part satisfi that there wa no hope for the
countri unless england help it in some wai though thei did not like
have to accept the help but the more bigot and narrowmind among
them were undoubtedli oppos to english interfer and under their
leader paul kruger who wa at the time run for the presid
chair did their best to be rid of it thei found readi alli in the
holland clientel with which mr burger had surround himself
head by the famou dr jorissen who wa like most of the ruler of
thi singular state an exclergyman but now an attorneygener not
learn in the law these men were for the most part entir unfit for
the posit thei held and fear that in the event of the countri
chang hand thei might be eject from them and also thei did all
englishmen the favour to regard them with that particularli virul
and gener hatr which is a part of the secret creed of mani
foreign more especi of such as ar under our protect as mai
easili be imagin what between all these differ parti and the
presenc of the special commission there were certainli plenti of
intrigu go on in pretoria dure the first few month of 1877
and the polit excit wa veri great nobodi knew how far sir t
shepston wa prepar to go and everybodi wa afraid of put out
hi hand further than he could pull it back and try to make himself
comfort on two stool at onc member of the volksraad and other
promin individu in the countri who had dure the dai been
denounc the commission in no measur term and even propos
that he and hi staff should be shot as a warn to the english
govern might be seen arriv at hi hous under cover of the
shade of even to have a littl talk with him and express the
earnest hope that it wa hi intent to annex the countri as soon as
possibl it is necessari to assist at a peaceabl annex to learn
the depth of mean human natur is capabl of
in pretoria at ani rate the ladi were of great servic to the caus
of the mission sinc thei were nearli all in favour of a chang of
govern and that be the case thei natur soon brought their
husband brother and lover to look at thing from the same point
of view it wa a wise man who said that in ani matter where it is
necessari to obtain the goodwil of a popul you should win over the
women that done you need not troubl yourself about the men
though the countri wa thu overflow with polit intrigu
noth of the kind went on in the commission camp it wa not he
who made the plot to catch the transvaal on the contrari thei made
the plot to catch him for sever month all that he did wa to sit
still and let the rival passion work their wai fight what the zulu
afterward call the fight of sit down when anybodi came to see him
he wa veri glad to meet them point out the desper condit of
the countri and ask them if thei could suggest a remedi and that wa
about all he did do beyond inform himself veri carefulli as to
all that wa go on in the countri and the movement of the nativ
within and outsid it border there wa no monei spent on briberi as
ha been state though it is imposs to imagin a state of affair
in which it would have been more easi to bribe or in which it could
have been done with greater effect unless inde the promis that some
pension should be paid to presid burger can be call a bribe which
it wa certainli never intend to be but simpli a guarante that after
have spent all hi privat mean on behalf of the state he should not
be left destitut the statement that the annex wa effect
under a threat that if the govern did not give it consent sir t
shepston would let loos the zulu on the countri is also a wick and
malici invent but with thi i shall deal more at length further
on
it must not howev be understood that the annex wa a foregon
conclus or that sir t shepston came up to the transvaal with
the fix intent of annex the countri without refer to it
posit mere with a view of extend british influenc or as
ha been absurdli state in order to benefit natal he had no fix
purpos whether it were necessari or no of exercis the full power
given to him by hi commiss on the contrari he wa all along most
anxiou to find some intern resourc within the state by mean of
which annex could be avert and of thi fact hi variou letter
and despatch give full proof thu in hi letter to presid
burger of the 9th april 1877 in which he announc hi intent
of annex the countri he sai i have more than onc assur your
honour that if i could think of ani plan by which the independ of
the state could be maintain by it own intern resourc i would
most certainli not conceal that plan from you it is also incident
remark confirm by a passag in mr burger posthum defenc in
which he sai henc i met shepston alon in my hous and open up
the subject of hi mission with a candour that astonish me he avow
that hi purpos wa to annex the countri as he had suffici ground
for it unless i could so alter as to satisfi hi govern my plan of
a new constitut model after that of america of a stand polic
forc of two hundr mount men wa then propos he promis to give
me time to call the volksraad togeth and to abandon hi design if
the volksraad would adopt these measur and the countri be will to
submit to them and to carri them out further on he sai in justic
to shepston i must sai that i would not consid an offic of my
govern to have act faithfulli if he had not done what shepston
did
it ha also been frequent alleg in england and alwai seem to be
taken as the groundwork of argument in the matter of the annex
that the special commission repres that the major of the
inhabit wish for the annex and that it wa sanction on
that ground thi statement show the great ignor that exist in
thi countri of south african affair an ignor which in thi case
ha been carefulli foster by mr gladston govern for parti
purpos thei have found it necessari to assum in order to make
their posit in the matter tenabl that sir t shepston and other
offici had been guilti of misrepresent unfortun the
govern and it support have been more intent upon make out
their case than upon ascertain the truth of their statement if thei
had taken the troubl to refer to sir t shepston despatch thei
would have found that the ground on which the transvaal wa annex wa
not becaus the major of the inhabit wish for it but becaus
the state wa drift into anarchi wa bankrupt and wa about to be
destroi by nativ tribe thei would further have found that sir
t shepston never repres that the major of the boer were in
favour of annex what he did sai wa that most think men in the
countri saw no other wai out of the difficulti but what proport of
the boer can be call think men he also said in the fifteenth
paragraph of hi despatch to lord carnarvon of 6th march 1877 that
petit sign by 2500 peopl repres everi class of the
commun out of a total adult popul of 8000 had been present
to the govern of the republ set forth it difficulti and
danger and prai it to treat with me for their amelior or
remov he also state and with perfect truth that mani more would
have sign had it not been for the terror that wa exercis and
that all the town and villag in the countri desir the chang which
wa a patent fact
thi is the foundat on which the charg of misrepresent is
builta charg which ha been manipul so skilfulli and with such a
charm disregard for the truth that the british public ha been dupe
into believ it when it is examin into it vanish into thin air
but a darker charg ha been brought against the special commissionera
charg affect hi honour as a gentleman and hi charact as a
christian and strang to sai ha gain a consider credenc
especi amongst a certain parti in england i allud to the statement
that he call up the zulu armi with the intent of sweep the
transvaal if the annex wa object to i mai state from my own
person knowledg that the report is a complet falsehood and that
no such threat wa ever made either by sir t shepston or by anybodi
connect with him and i will briefli prove what i sai
when the mission first arriv at pretoria a messag came from cetywayo
to the effect that he had heard that the boer had fire at sompseu
sir t shepston and announc hi intent of attack the
transvaal if hi father wa touch about the middl of march
alarm rumour began to spread as to the intend action of cetywayo
with refer to the transvaal but as sir t shepston did not think
that the king would be like to make ani hostil movement whilst he
wa in the countri he took no step in the matter neither did the
transvaal govern ask hi advic and assist inde a remark
trait in the boer is their suprem selfconceit which make them
believ that thei ar capabl of subdu all the nativ in africa
and of thrash the whole british armi if necessari unfortun the
recent cours of event ha tend to confirm them in their opinion
as regard their white enemi to return toward the second week in
april or the week befor the proclam of annex wa issu
thing began to look veri seriou inde rumour that could hardli be
discredit reach the special commission that the whole of the zulu
armi wa collect in a chain of impi or battalion with the intent
of burst into the transvaal and sweep the countri know
how terribl would be the catastroph if thi were to happen sir t
shepston wa much alarm about the matter and at a meet with the
execut council of the transvaal govern he point out to them
the great danger in which the countri wa place thi wa done in the
presenc of sever offic of hi staff and it wa on thi friendli
exposit of the state of affair that the charg that he had
threaten the countri with invas by the zulu wa base on the 11th
of april or the dai befor the annex a messag wa despatch
to cetywayo tell him of the report that had reach pretoria
and state that if thei were true he must forthwith give up all
such intent as the transvaal would at onc be place under the
sovereignti of her majesti and that if he had assembl ani armi
for purpos of aggress thei must be disband at onc sir t
shepston messag reach zululand not a dai too soon had the
annex of the transvaal been delai by a few week evenand thi
is a point which i earnestli beg englishmen to rememb in connect
with that actcetywayo armi would have enter the transvaal
carri death befor them and leav a wilder behind them
cetywayo answer to the special commission messag will
suffici show to us sir theophilu own word in hi despatch on
the subject the pinnacl of peril which the republ and south africa
gener had reach at the moment when the annex took place he
sai i thank my father sompseu sir t shepston for hi messag i
am glad that he ha sent it becaus the dutch have tire me out and
i intend to fight them onc and onc onli and to drive them over
the vaal kabana name of messeng you see my impi armi ar
gather it wa to fight the dutch i call them togeth now i
will send them back to their home is it well that two men
amadodaamabili should be made iziula fool in the reign of my
father umpanda the boer were constantli move their boundari further
into my countri sinc hi death the same thing ha been done i had
therefor determin to end it onc for all the messag then goe on
to other matter and end with a request to be allow to fight the
amaswazi becaus thei fight togeth and kill on anoth thi sai
cetywayo naiv is wrong and i want to chastis them for it
thi quotat will suffic to convinc all reason men put
asid all other matter from what immin danger the transvaal wa
deliv by the muchabus annex
some month after that event howev it occur to the ingeni
mind of some malici individu in natal that properli us much
polit capit might be made out of thi zulu incid and the stori
that cetywayo armi had been call up by sir theophilu himself
to overaw and if necessari subdu the transvaal wa accordingli
invent and industri circul although sir t shepston at
onc caus it to be authorit contradict such an astonish
slander natur took firm root and on the 12th april 1879 we have mr
m w pretoriu on of the boer leader publicli state at a meet
of the farmer that previou to the annex sir t shepston had
threaten the transvaal with an attack from the zulu as an argument
for advanc the annex under such an imput the govern
could no longer keep silenc and accordingli sir owen lanyon who wa
then administr of the transvaal caus the matter to be offici
investig with these result which ar sum up by him in a letter
to mr pretoriu date 1st mai 1879
1 the record of the republican execut council contain no allus
to ani such statement
2 two member of that council file statement in which thei
unreservedli deni that sir t shepston us the word or threat
imput to him
3 two offic of sir t shepston staff who were alwai present
with him at interview with the execut council file statement to
the same effect
i have no doubt add sir owen lanyon that the report ha been
origin and circul by some evildispos person
in addit to thi evid we have a letter written to the coloni
offic by sir t shepston date london august 12 1879 in which
he point out that mr pretoriu wa not even present at ani of the
interview with the execut council on which occas he accus him
of have made us of the threat he further show that the us of such
a threat on hi part would have been the depth of folli and knowingli
to court the instant and ignomini failur of my mission becaus
the boer were so persuad of their own prowess that thei could not be
convinc that thei stood in ani danger from nativ sourc and also
becaus such plai with such keenedg tool as the excit passion of
savag ar and especi such savag as i knew the zulu to be is
not what an experi of fortytwo year in manag them inclin me
to and yet in the face of all thi accumul evid thi report
continu to be believ that is by those who wish to believ it
such ar the accus that have been brought against the manner
of the annex and the offic who carri it out and never were
accus more groundless inde both for parti purpos and from
person animu everi mean fair or foul ha been us to discredit
it and all connect with it to take a singl instanc on author
miss colenso p 134 histori of the zulu war actual goe the
length of put a portion of a speech made by presid burger into
the mouth of sir t shepston and then abus him for hi incred
profan sure thi exce the limit of fair critic
befor i go on to the actual histori of the annex there is on
point i wish to submit to my reader in england the chang of govern
ha alwai been talk of as though it onli affect the forti thousand
white inhabit of the countri whilst everybodi seem to forget
that thi same land had about a million human be live on it it
origin owner and onli unfortun for themselv possess a
black skin and therefor entitl to littl considerationeven at the
hand of the most philanthrop govern in the world it never seem
to have occur to those who have rais so much outcri on behalf of
the forti thousand boer to inquir what wa thought of the matter by
the million nativ if thei were to be allow a voic in their own
dispos the countri wa certainli annex by the wish of a veri larg
major of it inhabit it is true that secocoeni instig
thereto by the boer afterward continu the war against us but with
the except of thi on chief the advent of our rule wa hail with
joi by everi nativ in the transvaal and even he wa glad of it at the
time dure our period of rule in the transvaal the nativ have had
as thei foresaw more peac than at ani time sinc the white man set
foot in the land thei have paid their tax gladli and there ha been
no fight among themselv but sinc we have given up the countri
we hear a veri differ tale it is thi million of men women and
children who notwithstand their black skin live and feel and have
intellig as much as ourselv who ar the princip becaus the
most numer suffer from mr gladston conjur trick that can
turn a sovereign into a suzerain as airili as the professor of magic
bring a litter of guineapig out of a top hat it is our falsehood
and treacheri to them whom we took over for ever as we told them and
whom we have now hand back to their natur enemi to be paid off for
their loyalti to the englishman that is the blackest stain in all thi
black busi and that ha destroi our prestig and caus us to be
look on amongst them for thei do not hide their opinion as coward
and liar
but veri littl attent howev seem to have been paid to nativ
view or claim at ani time in the transvaal inde thei have all along
been treat as serf of the soil to be sold with it if necessari to
a new master it is true that the govern act under pressur
from the aborigin protect societi made on the occas of the
surrend a feebl effort to secur the independ of some of the
nativ tribe but when the boer leader told them shortli that thei
would have noth of the sort and that if thei were not care thei
would reoccupi la nek the propos wa at onc drop with mani
assur that no offenc wa intend the worst of the matter is that
thi treatment of our nativ subject and alli will assuredli recoil
on the head of futur innoc govern
shortli after the appoint of the jointcommiss allud to at the
begin of thi chapter presid burger who wa now in possess
of the special commission intent should he be unabl to carri
out reform suffici drastic to satisfi the english govern
thought it best to call togeth the volksraad in the meantim it had
been announc that the rebel secocoeni had su for peac and sign
a treati declar himself a subject of the republ i shall have to
enter into the question of thi treati a littl further on so i will
at present onli sai that it wa the first busi laid befor the raad
and after some discuss ratifi next in order to the secocoeni
peac came the question of confeder as laid down in lord
carnarvon permiss bill thi propos wa laid befor them in an
earnest and eloqu speech by their presid who entreat them
to consid the danger posit of the republ and to face their
difficulti like men the question wa refer to a committe and
an advers report be brought up wa reject without further
consider it is just possibl that intimid had someth to do
with the summari treatment of so import a matter see that whilst
it wa be argu a larg mob of boer look veri formid with
their seacow hide whip watch everi move of their repres
through the window of the volksraad hall it wa mr chamberlain
caucu system in practic and visibl oper
a few dai after the reject of the confeder bill presid
burger who had frequent allud to the desper condit of the
republ and state that either some radic reform must be effect
or the countri must come under the british flag laid befor the raad a
brand new constitut of a veri remark natur assert that thei
must either accept it or lose their independ
the first part of thi strang document dealt with the peopl and their
right which remain much as thei were befor with the except that
the secreci of all letter entrust to the post wa to be inviol
the recognit of thi right is an amus incid in the histori of a
free republ under follow articl the volksraad wa entrust with
the charg of the nativ inhabit of the state the provis for the
administr of justic the conduct of educ the regul of
moneybil c it is in the fourth chapter howev that we come
to the real gist of the bill which wa the endow of the state
presid with the author of a dictat mr burger thought to save
the state by make himself an absolut monarch he wa to be elect
for a period of seven year instead of five year and to be elig
for reelect in him wa vest the power of make all appoint
without refer to the legislatur all law were to be drawn up by
him and he wa to have the right of veto on volksraad resolut
which bodi he could summon and dissolv at will final hi execut
council wa to consist of head of depart appoint by himself and
of on member of the volksraad the volksraad treat thi bill in much
the same wai as thei had dealt with the permiss confeder bill
gave it a casual consider and threw it out
the presid meanwhil wa do hi best to convinc the raad of
the danger of the countri that the treasuri wa empti whilst dun were
press that enemi were threaten on everi side and final
that her majesti special commission wa encamp within a thousand
yard of them watch their deliber with some interest he
show them that it wa imposs at onc to scorn reform and reject
friendli offer that it wa doubt if anyth could save them but
that if thei took no step thei were certainli lost as a nation the
father of the land howev declin to danc to the presid
pipe then he took a bolder line he told them that a guilti nation
never can evad the judgment that follow it step he ask them
conscienti to advis the peopl not obstin to refus a union
with a power govern he could not advis them to refus such a
union he did not believ that a new constitut would save
them for as littl as the old constitut had brought them to ruin so
littl would a new constitut bring salvat if the citizen
of england had behav toward the crown as the burgher of thi state
had behav to their govern england would never have stood so long
as she had he point out to them their hopeless financi posit
todai he said a bill for 1100 pound wa laid befor me for
signatur but i would sooner have cut off my right hand than sign that
papercheersfor i have not the slightest ground to expect that
when that bill becom due there will be a penni to pai it with
and final he exhort them thu let them make the best of the
situat and get the best term thei possibl could let them agre to
join their hand to those of their brethren in the south and then from
the cape to the zambesi there would be on great peopl ye there wa
someth grand in that grander even than their idea of a republ
someth which minist to their nation feelingcheersand
would thi be so miser ye thi would be miser for those who
would not be under the law for the rebel and the revolutionist but
welfar and prosper for the men of law and order
these power word form a strong indict against the republ
and from them there can be littl doubt that presid burger wa
thoroughli convinc of the necess and wisdom of the annex it
is interest to compar them and mani other utter of hi made at
thi period with the opinion he express in the posthum document
recent publish in which he speak somewhat jubilantli of the
lesson taught us on la nek and majuba by such an inher
weak peopl as the boer and point to them as strike instanc of
retribut in thi document he attribut the annex to the desir
to advanc english supremaci in south africa and to lai hold of the wai
to central south africa it is howev notic that he doe not in
ani wai indic how it could have been avert and the state continu
to exist and he seem all along to feel that hi case is a weak on
for in explain or attempt to explain why he had never defend
himself from the charg brought against him in connect with the
annex he sai had i not endur in silenc had i not born
patient all the accus but out of selfish or fear told
the plain truth of the case the transvaal would never have had the
consider it ha now receiv from great britain howev unjust the
annex wa my selfjustif would have expos the boer to
such an extent and the state of the countri in such a wai that it
would have depriv them both of the sympathi of the world and the
consider of the english politician in other word if i had
told the truth about thing as i should have been oblig to do
to justifi myself there would have been no more outcri about the
annex becaus the whole world even the english radic would
have recognis how necessari it wa and what a fear state the
countri wa in
but to let that pass it is evid that presid burger did not take
the same view of the annex in 1877 as he did in 1881 and inde
hi speech to the volksraad would read rather oddli print in
parallel column with hi posthum statement the reader would be
forc to on of two conclus either on on of the two occas he
is sai what he doe not mean or he must have chang hi mind as
i believ him to have been an honest man i inclin to the latter
supposit nor do i consid it so veri hard to account for take
into consider hi natur dutch procliv in 1877 burger is
the despair head of a state drive rapidli to ruin if not to actual
extinct when the strong hand of the english govern is held out
to him what wonder that he accept it gladli on behalf of hi countri
which is by it help brought into a state of greater prosper than
it ha ever befor known in 1881 the wheel ha gone round and great
event have come about whilst he li dy the enemi of the boer
have been destroi the power of the zulu and secocoeni ar no more
the countri ha prosper under a healthi rule and it financ have
been restor moreglad tide have come from midlothian to the
rebel and the revolutionist whose hope were flag and eloqu
word have been spoken by the new english dictat that have arous
a great rebellion and to crown all english troop have suffer on
massacr and three defeat and england sue for peac from the south
african peasant heedless of honour or her broken word so that the
prayer be grant with such event befor him that dy man mai well
have found caus to chang hi opinion doubtless the annex wa
wrong sinc england disown her act and mai not that dream about
the great south african republ come true after all ha not the
preemin of the englishman receiv a blow from which it can never
recov and is not hi control over boer and nativ irredeem
weaken and must heburgersgo down to poster as a dutchman who
tri to forward the interest of the english parti no doubtless the
annex wa wrong but it ha done good for it ha brought about the
downfal of the english and we will end the argument in the veri word
of hi last public utter with which he end hi statement south
africa gain more from thi and ha made a larger step forward in the
march of freedom than most peopl can conceiv
who shall sai that he is wrong the word of dy men ar sometim
prophet south africa ha made a great advanc toward the freedom
of a dutch republ
thi ha been a digress but i hope not an uninterest on to
returnon the 1st march sir t shepston met the execut council
and told them that in hi opinion there wa now but on remedi to be
adopt and that wa that the transvaal should be unit with english
coloni of south africa under on head name the queen sai at the
same time that the onli thing now left to the republ wa to make the
best arrang it could for the futur benefit of it inhabit
and to submit to that which he saw to be and everi think man saw to
be inevit so soon as thi inform wa offici commun

behalf of the boer govern and secocoeni wa examin and also two
nativ petro and jeremiah who were with him but did not actual
interpret all these men persist that secocoeni had posit refus
to becom a subject of the republ and onli consent to sign the
treati on the represent of command ferreira that it would onli
be bind as regard to the two articl about the cattl and the
boundari line
the commiss then proceed to secocoeni town accompani by a
fresh set of interpret and had a long interview with secocoeni the
chief prime minist or mouth makurupiji speak in hi presenc
and on hi behalf and make us of the pronoun i befor all the
assembl headmen of the tribe gave an account of the interview between
command ferreira in the presenc of that gentleman who accompani
the commiss and secocoeni in almost the same word as had been us
by the interpret at middelburg he distinctli deni have consent
to becom a subject of the republ or to stand under the law and ad
that he fear he had touch the feather to sign thing that
he did not know of in the treati command ferreira then put some
question but entir fail to shake the evid on the contrari
he admit by hi question that secocoeni had not consent to becom
a subject of the republ secocoeni had evid sign the piec of
paper under the impress that he wa acknowledg hi liabil to
pai 2000 head of cattl and fix a certain portion of hi boundari
line and on the distinct understand that he wa not to becom a
subject of the state
now it wa the secocoeni war that had brought the english mission into
the countri and if it could be shown that the secocoeni war had come
to a success termin it would go far toward help the mission
out again to thi end it wa necessari that the chief should declar
himself a subject of the state and therebi by implic acknowledg
himself to have been a rebel and admit hi defeat all that wa
requir wa a signatur and that onc obtain the treati wa
publish and submit to the raad for confirm without a whisper
be heard of the condit under which thi ignor basutu wa
induc to sign had no commiss visit secocoeni thi treati would
afterward have been produc against him in it entireti altogeth
the histori of the secocoeni peac treati doe not reassur on as
to the genuin of the treati which the boer ar continu
produc purport to have been sign by nativ chief and as
a gener rule present the state with great tract of countri in
exchang for a hors or a few oxen howev fond the nativ mai be of
their boer neighbour such liber can scarc be genuin on the
other hand it is so easi to induc a savag to sign a paper or even
if he is retic to make a cross for him and onc made as we all
know litera scripa manet and becom titl to the land
dure the secocoeni investig affair in the transvaal were
steadili drift toward anarchi the air wa fill with rumour
now it wa report that an outbreak wa immin amongst the english
popul at the gold field who had never forgotten von schlickmann

dutch paper die patriot publish in the cape coloni which ar so
typic of the boer and of the onli literatur that ha the slightest

a rather odd argument in favour of paul elect becaus he himself

that all hi abil is from our lord becaus he is a warrior becaus
he is a boer then paul kruger the warrior and the boer is compar

exactli the statesman to further govern the republ then it will be
your greatest honour to sai citizen i have deliv you from the
enemi i am no statesman but now you have peac and time to choos and
elect a good presid
an articl such as the abov is instruct read as show the low
calibr of the mind that ar influenc by it yet such write
and sermon have more power among the boer than ani other argument
appeal as thei do to the fanatic and vaniti of their natur which
caus them to believ that the divin is continu interf on
their behalf at the cost of other peopl it will be notic that the
refer given ar all to the old testament and nearli all refer to
act of blood
these doctrin were not howev at all accept to burger parti
or the more enlighten member of the commun and so bitter did the
struggl of rival opinion becom that there is veri littl doubt that
had the countri not been annex civil war would have been ad to it
other calam meanwhil the nativ were from dai to dai becom
more restless and messeng were constantli arriv at the special
commission camp beg that their tribe might be put under the
queen and state that thei would fight rather than submit ani longer
to the boer
at length on the 9th april sir t shepston inform the govern
of the republ that he wa about to declar the transvaal british
territori he told them that he had consid and reconsid hi
determin but that he could see no possibl mean within the state
by which it could free itself from the burden that were sink it
to destruct ad that if he could have found such mean he would
certainli not have hidden them from the govern thi intim wa
receiv in silenc though all the later proceed with refer
to the annex were in realiti carri out in concert with the
author of the republ thu on the 13th march the govern
submit a paper of ten question to sir t shepston as regard the
futur condit of the transvaal under english rule whether the debt
of the state would be guarante c to these question repli were
given which were on the whole satisfactori to the govern as these
repli form the basi of the proclam guarante it is not
necessari to enter into them
it wa further arrang by the republican govern that a formal
protest should be enter against the annex which wa accordingli
prepar and privat shown to the special commission the annex
proclam wa also shown to presid burger and a paragraph
elimin at hi suggest in fact the special commission and the
presid togeth with most of hi execut were quit at on as
regard the necess of the proclam be issu their joint
endeavour be direct to the prevent of ani disturb and to
secur a good recept for the chang
at length after three month of inquiri and negoti the
proclam of annex wa on the 12th of april 1877 read by mr
osborn accompani by some other gentlemen of sir t shepston staff
it wa an anxiou moment for all concern to us the word of the
special commission in hi despatch home on the subject everi effort
had been made dure the previou fortnight by it is said educ
holland and who had but late arriv in the countri to rous the
fanatic of the boer and induc them to offer bloodi resist to
what it wa known i intend to do the boer were appeal to in the
most inflammatori languag by print manifesto and memori
it wa urg that i had but a small escort which could easili be
overpow in a countri so full of desperado and fanat hater
of anyth english it wa more than possibl than though such an act
would have been condemn by the gener sens of the countri a number
of men could easili be found who would think thei were do a righteou
act in greet the annexationist with an ovat of bullet i
do not mean that the anxieti wa person becaus i do not think the
member of that small parti set ani higher valu on their live than
other peopl but it wa absolut necessari for the success of the act
itself and for the safeti of the countri that not a singl shot should
be fire had that happen it is probabl that the whole countri would
have been involv in confus and bloodsh the zulu would have
broken in and the kafir would have risen in fact to us cetywayo
word the land would have burn with fire
it will therefor be easili understood what an anxiou hour that wa
both for the special commission sit up at govern hous and
for hi staff down on the market squar and how thank thei were
when the proclam wa receiv with hearti cheer by the crowd mr
burger protest which wa read immedi afterward wa receiv in
respect silenc
and thu the transvaal territori pass for a while into the great
famili of the english coloni i believ that the greatest polit
oppon of the act will bear tribut to the veri remark abil
with which it wa carri out when the varieti and number of the
variou interest that had to be concili the obstin natur of
the individu who had to be convinc as well as the innat hatr of
the english name and wai which had to be overcom to carri out thi
act successfulli ar taken into consider togeth with a thousand
other matter the neglect of ani on of which would have suffic to
make failur certain it will be seen what tact and skill and knowledg
of human natur were requir to execut so difficult a task it must be
rememb that no forc wa us and that there never wa ani threat
of forc the few troop that were to enter the transvaal were four
week march from pretoria at the time there wa noth whatsoev
to prevent the boer put a summari stop to the proceed of the
commission if thei had thought fit
that sir theophilu plai a bold and hazard game nobodi will deni
but like most player who combin bold with cool of head and
justic of caus he won and without shed a singl drop of blood
or even confisc an acr of land and at no cost annex a great
countri and avert a veri seriou war that same countri four year
later cost us a million of monei the loss of nearli a thousand men
kill and wound and the ruin of mani more confid thousand to
surrend it is true howev that nobodi can accus the retrocess
of have been conduct with judgment or abilityveri much the
contrari
there can be no more ampl justif of the necess of the issu
of the annex proclam than the proclam itself
first it touch on the sand river convent of 1852 by which
independ wa grant to the state and show that the evid
object and incit motiv in grant such guarante were to promot
peac freetrad and friendli intercours in the hope and belief that
the republ would becom a flourish and selfsustain state a
sourc of strength and secur to neighbour european commun
and a point from which christian and civilis might rapidli
spread toward central africa it goe on to show how these hope have
been disappoint and how that increas weak in the state itself
on the on side and more than correspond growth of real strength
and confid among the nativ tribe on the other have produc their
natur and inevit consequ that after more or less of
irrit conflict with aborigin tribe to the north there commenc
about the year 1867 gradual abandon to the nativ in that direct
of territori settl by burgher of the transvaal in wellbuilt town
and villag and on grant farm
it goe on to show that thi decai of power and ebb of author in
the north is be follow by similar process in the south under
yet more danger circumst peopl of thi state resid in
that direct have been compel within the last three month at the
bid of nativ chief and at a moment notic to leav their farm
and home their stand crop all to be taken possess
of by nativ but that the govern is more powerless than ever
to vindic it assum right or to resist the declens that is
threaten it exist it then recit how all the other coloni
and commun of south africa have lost confid in the state
how it is in a condit of hopeless bankruptci and it commerc
annihil whilst the inhabit ar divid into faction and the
govern ha fallen into helpless paralysi how also the prospect
of the elect of a new presid instead of be look forward to
with hope would in the opinion of all parti be the signal for civil
war anarchi and bloodsh how that thi state of thing afford the
veri strongest temptat to the great neighbour nativ power to
attack the countri a temptat that thei were onli too readi and
anxiou to yield to and that the state wa in far too feebl a
condit to repel such attack from which it had hitherto onli been
save by the repeat represent of the govern of natal the
next paragraph i will quot as thei stand for thei sum up the reason
for the annex
that the secocoeni war which would have produc but littl effect
on a healthi constitut ha not onli prove suddenli fatal to the
resourc and reput of the republ but ha shown itself to be a
culmin point in the histori of south africa in that a makate
or basutu tribe unwarlik and of no account in zulu estim
successfulli withstood the strength of the state and disclos for the
first time to the nativ power outsid the republ from the zambesi
to the cape the great chang that had taken place in the rel
strength of the white and black race that thi disclosur at onc
shook the prestig of the white man in south africa and place
everi european commun in peril that thi common danger ha caus
univers anxieti ha given to all concern the right to investig
it caus and to protect themselv from it consequ and ha
impos the duti upon those who have the power to shield enfeebl
civilis from the encroach of barbar and inhuman it
proce to point out that the transvaal will be the first to suffer
from the result of it own polici and that it is for everi reason
perfectli imposs for her majesti govern to stand by and see a
friendli white state ravag know that it own possess will be
the next to suffer that h m govern be persuad that the onli
mean to prevent such a catastroph would be by the annex of the
countri and know that thi wa the wish of a larg proport of
the inhabit of the transvaal the step must be taken next follow
the formal annex
togeth with the proclam an address wa issu by sir t
shepston to the burgher of the state lai the fact befor them
in a friendli manner more suit to their mode of thought than it wa
possibl to do in a formal proclam thi document the issu
of which wa on of those touch that ensur the success of the
annex wa a power sum up in colloqui languag of the
argument us in the proclam strengthen by quotat from the
speech of the presid it end with these word it remain onli
for me to beg of you to consid and weigh what i have said calmli and
without undu prejudic let not mere feel or sentiment prevail over
your judgment accept what her majesti govern intend shall be
and what you will soon find from experi is a bless not onli to
you and your children but to the whole of south africa through you and
i believ that i speak these word to you as a friend from my heart
two other proclam were also issu on notifi the assumpt
of the offic of administr of the govern by sir t shepston
and the other repeal the wartax which wa doubtless an unequ and
oppress impost

who were anywher within reach were summon to attend the first formal

the english flag wa dure the sign of the

queen entir approv of your conduct sinc you receiv her majesti
commiss with a renew of my own thank on behalf of the govern
for the admir prudenc and discret with which you have discharg
a great and unwont respons it wa also accept by parliament
with veri few dissenti voic sinc it wa not till afterward when
the subject becam us as an election howl that the liber
parti head by our power popular minist discov the deep
iniqu that had been perpetr in south africa so satisfi were
the transvaal boer with the chang that messr kruger jorissen
and bok who form the deput to proce to england and present
presid burger formal protest against the annex found great
difficulti in rais onehalf of the necessari expensessometh
under on thousand poundstoward the cost of the undertak the
thirst for independ cannot have been veri great when all the wealthi
burgher in the transvaal put togeth would not subscrib a thousand
pound toward retain it inde at thi time the member of the
deput themselv seem to have look upon their undertak
as be both doubt and undesir sinc thei inform sir t
shepston that thei were go to europ to discharg an oblig
which had been impos upon them and if the mission fail thei would
have done their duti mr kruger said that if thei did fail he would be
found to be as faith a subject under the new form of govern as he
had been under the old and dr jorissen admit with equal frank
that the chang wa inevit and express hi belief that the
cancel of it would be calamit
whilst the annex wa thu well receiv in the countri immedi
interest a live agit wa commenc in the western provinc of
the cape coloni a thousand mile awai with a view of induc the
home govern to repudi sir t shepston act the reason of thi
movement wa that the cape dutch parti care littl or noth for
the real interest of the transvaal did care a great deal about their
scheme to turn all the white commun of south africa into a
great dutch republ to which thei thought the annex would be a
deathblow as i have said elsewher it must be born in mind that the
string of the antiannex agit have all along been pull in
the western provinc whilst the transvaal boer have plai the part
of puppet the instrument us by the leader of the movement in
the cape were for the most part the discont and unprincipl
holland element a newspap of an extrem abus natur call the
volkstem and anoth in natal known as the natal wit late
edit by the notori aylward which ha an almost equal unenvi
reput
on the arriv of messr jorissen and kruger in england thei were
receiv with great civil by lord carnarvon who wa howev
care to explain to them that the annex wa irrevoc in thi
decis thei cheerfulli acquiesc assur hi lordship of their
determin to do all thei could to induc the boer to accept the
new state of thing and express their desir to be allow to serv
under the new govern
whilst these gentlemen were thu satisfactorili arrang matter with
lord carnarvon sir t shepston wa make a tour round the countri
which resembl a triumphal progress more than anyth els he wa
everywher greet with enthusiasm by all class of the commun
boer english and nativ and numer address were present to
him couch in the warmest languag not onli by englishmen but also by
boer
it is veri difficult to reconcil the enthusiasm of a great number
of the inhabit of the transvaal for english rule and the quit
acquiesc of the remaind at thi time with the decidedli
antagonist attitud assum later on it appear to me howev that
there ar sever reason that go far toward account for it the
transvaal when we annex it wa in the posit of a man with a knife
at hi throat who is suddenli rescu by some on stronger than he on
certain condit which at the time he gladli accept but afterward
when the danger is pass wish to repudi in the same wai the
inhabit of the south african republ were in the time of need veri
thank for our aid but after a while when the recollect of their
difficulti had grown faint when their debt had been paid and their
enemi defeat thei began to think that thei would like to get rid of
us again and start fresh on their own account with a clean sheet what
foster agit more than anyth els howev wa the perfect
impun in which it wa allow to be carri on had onli a littl
firm and decis been shown in the first instanc there would
have been no further troubl we might have been oblig to confisc
halfadozen farm and perhap imprison as mani free burgher for a
few month and there it would have end neither boer or nativ
understand our nambypambi wai of plai at govern thei put it
down to fear what thei want and what thei expect is to be govern
with a just but a firm hand thu when the boer found that thei could
agit with impun thei natur enough continu to agit
anybodi who know them will understand that it wa veri pleasant to them
to find themselv in possess of that delight thing a grievanc
and instead of stop quietli at home on their farm to feel oblig
to proce full of import and long word to a distant meet
there to spout and listen to the spout of other it is so much
easier to talk polit than to sow meali some attribut the
discont among the boer to the postpon of the carri out
of the annex proclam promis with refer to the free
institut to be grant to the countri but in my opinion it had
littl or noth to do with it the boer never understood the question
of respons govern and never want that institut what
thei did want wa to be free of all english control and thi thei said
twenti time in the most outspoken languag i think there is littl
doubt the caus i have indic ar the real sourc of the agit
though there must be ad to them their detest of our mode of
deal with nativ and of be forc to pai tax regularli and
also the ceaseless agit of the cape wirepul through their
agent the holland and their organ in the press
on the return of messr kruger and jorissen to the transvaal the
latter gentleman resum hi duti as attorneygener on which
occas if i rememb aright i myself had the honour of administ
to him the oath of allegi to her majesti that he afterward kept
so well the former report the proceed of the deput to a
boer meet when he took a veri differ tone to that in which he
address lord carnarvon announc that if there exist a major of
the peopl in favour of independ he still wa vicepresid of the
countri
both these gentlemen remain for some time in the pai of the british
govern mr jorissen as attorneygener and mr kruger as member
of the execut council the govern howev at length found it
desir to dispens with their servic though on differ
ground mr jorissen had like sever other member of the republican
govern been a clergyman and wa quit unfit to hold the post of
attorneygener in an import coloni like the transvaal where legal
question were constantli aris requir all the attent of a
train mind and after he had on sever occas been publicli
admonish from the bench the govern retir him on liber term
needless to sai hi opposit to english rule then becam veri bitter
mr kruger appoint expir by law in novemb 1877 and the
govern did not think it advis to reemploi him the term of hi
letter of dismiss can be found on page 135 of blue book c 144
and involv as thei do a seriou charg of misrepresent in
monei matter ar not veri credit to him after thi event he also
pursu the caus of independ with increas vigour
dure the last month of 1877 and the first part of 1878 agit
against british rule went on uncheck and at last grew to alarm
proport so much so that sir t shepston on hi return from the
zulu border in march 1878 where he had been for some month discuss
the vex and danger question of the boundari line with the zulu
found it necessari to issu a stringent proclam warn the
agit that their proceed and meet were illeg and would be
punish accord to law thi document which wa at the time vulgarli
known as the holdyourjaw proclam not be follow by action
produc but littl effect
on the 4th april 1878 anoth boer meet wa conven at which it wa
decid to send a second deput to england to consist thi time of
messr kruger and joubert with mr bok as secretari thi deput
prove as abort as the first sir m hick beach assur it in a
letter date 6th august 1878 that it is imposs for mani reason
that the queen sovereignti should now be withdrawn
whilst the govern wa thu hamper by intern disaffect it
had also mani other difficulti on it hand first there wa the zulu
boundari question which wa constantli develop new danger to the
countri inde it wa imposs to sai what might happen in that
direct from on week to anoth nor were it relat with
secocoeni satisfactori it will be rememb that just befor the
annex thi chief had express hi earnest wish to becom a british
subject and even paid over part of the fine demand from him by the
boer govern to the civil commission major clark in march 1878
howev hi conduct toward the govern underw a sudden
chang and he practic declar war it afterward appear from
secocoeni own statement that he wa instig to thi step by
a boer abel erasmu by nameth same man who wa concern in the
atroc in the first secocoeni warwho constantli encourag him to
continu the struggl i do not propos to minut follow the cours of
thi long war which commenc in the begin of 1878 did not come
to an end till after the zulu war when sir garnet wolselei attack
secocoeni stronghold with a larg forc of troop volunt and
swazi alli and took it with great slaughter the loss on our side
were not veri heavi so far as white men were concern but the swazi
ar report to have lost 400 kill and 500 wound
the struggl wa dure the long period preced the final attack
carri on with great courag and abil by major clark ra cmg
whose forc at the best of time onli consist of 200 volunt and
100 zulu with thi small bodi of men he contriv howev to keep
secocoeni in check and to take some import stronghold it wa
mark also by some strike act of individu braveri of which on
perform by major clark himself whose reput for cool courag and
presenc of mind in danger is unsurpass in south africa is worthi of
notic and which had public attent been more concentr on the
secocoeni war would doubtless have won him the victoria cross on on
occas on visit on of the outli fort he found that a parti
of hostil nativ who were come down to the fort on the previou dai
with a flag of truce had been accident fire upon and had at onc
retreat as hi system in nativ warfar wa alwai to try and inspir
hi enemi with perfect faith in the honour of englishmen and their
contempt of all trick and treacheri even toward a foe he wa veri
angri at thi occurr and at onc unarm and unattend save by
hi nativ servant rode up into the mountain to the kraal from which
the white flag parti had come on the previou dai and apologis to
the chief for what had happen when i consid how veri anxiou
secocoeni nativ were to kill or captur clark whom thei held in
great dread and how terribl the end of so great a captain would in
all probabl have been had he taken aliv by these master of refin
tortur i confess that i think thi act of gentlemanli courag is on
of the most astonish thing i ever heard of when he rode up those
hill he must have known that he wa probabl go to meet hi death at
the hand of justli incens savag when secocoeni heard of what major
clark had done he wa so pleas that he shortli afterward releas
a volunt whom he had taken prison and who would otherwis in all
probabl have been tortur to death i must add that major clark
himself never report to or allud to thi incid but an account of
it can be found in a despatch written by sir o lanyon to the secretari
of state date 2d februari 1880
concurr with though entir distinct from the polit
agit that wa be carri on among the boer have for object
the restor of independ a privat agit wa set on foot
by a few disaffect person against sir t shepston with the view
of obtain hi remov from offic in favour of a certain colonel
weatherlei the detail of thi impud plot ar so interest and
the plot itself so typic of the state of affair with which sir t
shepston had to deal that i will give a short account of it
after the annex had taken place there were natur enough a good
mani individu who found themselv disappoint in the result so far
as thei person were concern i mean that thei did not get so much
out of it as thei expect among these wa a gentleman call colonel
weatherlei who had come to the transvaal as manag of a goldmin
compani but get tire of that had taken a promin part in
the annex and who be subsequ disappoint about an
appoint becam a bitter enemi of the administr i mai sai at
onc that colonel weatherlei seem to me to have been throughout the
dupe of the other conspir
the next personag wa a goodlook desperado who call himself
captain gunn of gunn and who wa local somewhat irrever known as
the veri gunn of veri gunn thi gentleman whose former career had been
of a most remark order wa on the annex of the countri found
in the public prison charg with have commit variou offenc but
on colonel weatherlei interest himself strongli on hi behalf he
wa eventu releas without trial on hi releas he request the
administr to publish a govern notic declar him innoc of
the charg brought against him thi sir t shepston declin to do
and so to us hi own word in a despatch to the high commission on
the subject captain gunn of gunn at onc becam what in thi countri
is call a patriot
the third person concern wa a lawyer who had got into troubl on the
diamond field and who felt himself injur becaus the rule of the
high court did not allow him to practis as an advoc the quartet
wa made up by mr cellier the editor of the patriot organ the
volkstem who sinc he had lost the govern print contract
found that no languag could be too strong to appli to the personnel
of the govern more especi it head of cours there wa a ladi
in it what plot would be complet without she wa mr weatherlei
now i believ mr gunn of gunn these gentlemen began oper by
draw up a long petit to sir bartl frere as high commission
set forth a string of suppos grievanc and wind up with a
request that the administr might be promot to some other
sphere of polit us thi memori wa forward by the
committe as thei call themselv to variou part of the countri
for signatur but without the slightest success the fact of the matter
be that it wa not the annexor but the annex that the boer
object to
at thi stage in the proceed colonel weatherlei went to try and
forward the good caus with sir bartl frere at the cape hi letter to
mr weatherlei from thenc afterward put into court in the celebr
divorc case contain mani interest account of hi attempt in
that direct i do not think howev that he wa cognis of what
wa be concoct by hi alli in pretoria but be a veri vain
weak man wa easili deceiv by them with all hi fault he wa a
gentleman as soon as he wa gone a second petit wa drawn up by the
committe show the advis of immedi suspend our
present administr and temporarili appoint and recommend for
her majesti royal and favour consider an english gentleman of
high integr and honour in whom the countri at larg ha respect and
confid
the english gentleman of high integr and honour of cours prove to
be colonel weatherlei whose appoint is further on respectfulli
but earnestli request sinc he had thoroughli gain the
affect confid and respect of boer english and other
european in thi countri but whilst it is compar easi to write
petit there is sometim a difficulti in get peopl to sign
them as prove to be the case with refer to the document under
consider when the committe and the employ in the offic of
the volkstem had affix their valuabl signatur it wa found to
be imposs to induc anybodi els to follow their exampl now a
petit with some half dozen signatur attach would not it wa
obviou carri much weight with the imperi govern and no more
could be obtain
but realli great mind rise superior to such difficulti and so did
the committe or some of them or on of them if thei could not
get genuin signatur to their petit thei could at ani rate
manufactur them thi great idea onc hit out so vigor wa it
prosecut that thei or some of them or on of them produc in a
veri littl while no less than 3883 signatur of which sixteen were
prove to be genuin five were doubt and all the rest fictiti
but the gentleman whoever he wa who wa the work partner in the
schemeand i mai state by wai of parenthesi that when gunn of gunn
wa subsequ arrest petit in process of signatur were found
under the mattress of hi bedcalcul without hi host he either
did not know or had forgotten that on receipt of such document by a
superior offic thei ar at onc sent to the offic accus to report
upon thi cours wa follow in the present case and the petit
were discov to be gross impostur the ingenu exercis by their
author or author wa realli veri remark for it must be rememb
that not on of the signatur wa forg thei were all invent and
had of cours to be written in a great varieti of hand the plan
gener pursu wa to put down the name of peopl live in the
countri with slight variat thu de villier becam de
willier and van zyl van zul i rememb that my own name
appear on on of the petit with some slight alter some of
the name were evid meant to be faceti thu there wa a jan
verneuk which mean john the cheat
of the person directli or indirectli concern in thi rascal plot
the unfortun colonel weatherli subsequ apologis to sir t
shepston for hi share in the agit and shortli afterward di
fight brave on kambula captain gunn of gunn and mr weatherlei
after have given rise to the most remark divorc case i ever
heardit took fourteen dai to trywer on the death of colonel
weatherlei unit in the bond of holi matrimoni and ar i believ
still in pretoria the lawyer vanish i know not where whilst mr
cellier still continu to edit that admir conduct journal the
volkstem nor if i mai judg from the report of a speech made by
him recent at a boer festiv which by the wai wa grace by the
presenc of our repres mr hudson the british resid ha
hi right hand forgotten it cun or rather hi tongu lost the us
of those peculiar and recherch epithet that us to adorn the column
of the volkstem i see that he on thi occas denounc the
english element as be poison and danger to a state and
state amidst loud cheer that he despis it mr cellier line
have fallen in pleasant place in ani other countri he would long ago
have fallen a victim to the stern law of libel i recommend him to
the notic of enterpris irish newspap such is the fresh and
vigour of hi style that i am confid he would make the fortun of ani
hibernian journal
some littl time after the gunn of gunn fraud a veri sad incid
happen in connect with the govern of the transvaal shortli
after the annex the home govern sent out mr sergeaunt
cmg on of the crown agent for the coloni to report on the
financi condit of the countri he wa accompani in an unoffici
capac amongst other gentlemen by captain patterson and hi son
mr j sergeaunt and when he return to england these two gentlemen
remain behind to go on a shoot expedit about thi time sir
bartl frere wa anxiou to send a friendli mission to lo bengula
king of the matabel a branch of the zulu tribe live up toward
the zambesi thi chief had been make himself unpleas by caus
trader to be rob and it wa thought desir to establish friendli
relat with him so it wa suggest to captain patterson and mr
sergeaunt that thei should combin busi with pleasur and go on
a mission to lo bengula an offer which thei accept and shortli
afterward start for matabeleland with an interpret and a few
servant thei reach their destin in safeti and have conclud
their busi with the king start on a visit to the zambesi fall
on foot leav the interpret with the wagon the fall were about
twelv dai walk from the king kraal and thei were accompani
thither by young mr thoma the son of the local missionari two kafir
servant and twenti nativ bearer suppli by lo bengula the next
thing that wa heard of them wa that thei had all di through drink
poison water full detail of the manner of their death be sent
down by lo bengula
in the first shock and confus of such new it wa not veri
close examin at ani rate by the friend of the dead men but on
reflect there were sever thing about it that appear strang
for instanc it wa well known that captain patterson had a habit for
which inde we had often laugh at him of howev thirsti he might
be alwai have hi water boil when he wa travel in order
to destroi impur and it seem odd that he should on thi on
occas have neglect the precaut also it wa curiou that the
major of lo bengula bearer appear to have escap wherea all
the other were without except kill nor even in that district is
it usual to find water so bad that it will kill with the rapid it had
been suppos to do in thi case unless inde it had been designedli
poison these doubt of the poisoningbywaterstori resolv
themselv into certainti when the waggon return in charg of the
interpret when by put two and two togeth we were abl to
piec out the real histori of the diabol murder of our poor friend
with consider accuraci a stori which show what bloodthirsti
wicked a savag is capabl of when he fanci hi interest ar
threaten
it appear that when captain patterson first interview lo bengula
he wa not at all well receiv by him i must by wai of explan
state that there exist a pretend to hi throne kruman by name who
as far as i can make out is the real heir to the kingdom thi man
had for some caus or other fled the countri and for a time act as
garden to sir t shepston in natal at the date of messr patterson
and sergeaunt mission to matabeleland he wa live i believ in the
transvaal captain patterson on find himself so ill receiv by the
king and not be suffici acquaint with the charact of savag
chief most unfortun either by accid or design drop some
hint in the cours of convers about thi kruman from that moment
lo bengula conduct toward the mission entir chang and drop
hi former tone he becam profus civil and from that moment too
he doubtless determin to kill them probabl fear that thei might
forward some scheme to oust him and place kruman on whose claim a larg
portion of hi peopl look favour on the throne
when their busi wa done and captain patterson told the king that
thei were anxiou befor return to visit the zambesi fall he
readili fell in with their wish but in the first instanc refus
permiss to young thoma the son of the missionari to accompani
them onli allow him to do so on the urgent represent of
captain patterson the reason for thi wa no doubt that he had
kindli feel toward the lad and did not wish to includ him in the
slaughter
captain patterson wa a man of extrem method habit and amongst
other thing wa in the habit of make note of all that he did hi
notebook had been taken off hi bodi and sent down to pretoria with
the other thing in it we found entri of hi prepar for the
trip includ the number and name of the bearer provid by lo
bengula we also found the chronicl of the first three dai journei
and that of the morn of the fourth dai but there the record stop
the last entri wa probabl made a few minut befor he wa kill and
it is to be observ that there wa no entri of the parti have been
for sever dai without water as state by the messeng and then
find the poison water
thi evid by itself would not have amount to much but now come
the curiou part of the stori show the truth of the old adag
murder will out it appear that when the waggon wa come down to
pretoria in charg of the interpret it wa outspan on dai outsid
the border of lo bengula countri when some kafirsbechuana i
thinkcam up ask for some tobacco and fell into convers with
the driver remark that he had come up with a full waggon and now he
went down with an empti on the driver repli by lament the death
by poison water of hi master whereupon on of the kafir told him
the follow storyh said that a brother of hi wa out hunt a
littl while back in the desert for ostrich with a parti of other
kafir when hear shot fire some wai off thei made for the spot
think that white men were out shoot and that thei would be abl
to beg meat on reach the spot which wa by a pool of water thei
saw the bodi of three white men ly on the ground and also those of
a hottentot and a kafir surround by an arm parti of kafir thei
at onc ask the kafir what thei had been do kill the white men
and were told to be still for it wa by order of the king thei
then learn the whole stori it appear that the white men had made a
middai halt by the water when on of the bearer who had gone to the
edg of the pool suddenli shout to them to come and look at a great
snake in the water captain patterson ran up and as he lean over the
edg wa instantli kill by a blow with an ax the other were then
shot and assegai the kafir further describ the cloth that hi
brother had seen on the bodi and also some articl that had been
given to hi parti by the murder that left littl doubt as to the
verac of hi stori and so end the mission to matabeleland
no public notic wa taken of the matter for the obviou reason that
it wa imposs to get at lo bengula to punish him nor would it have
been easi to come by legal evid to disprov the ingeni stori
of the poison water sinc anybodi try to reach the spot of the
massacr would probabl fall a victim to some similar accid befor
he got back again it is devoutli to be hope that the punish he
deserv will sooner or later overtak the author of thi devilish and
wholesal murder
the begin of 1879 wa signalis by the commenc of oper
in zululand and by the new of the terribl disast at isandhlwana
which fell on pretoria like a thunderclap it wa not howev ani
surpris to those who were acquaint with zulu tactic and with the
plan of attack adopt by the english command in fact i know
that on solemn warn of what would certainli happen to him if he
persist in hi plan of advanc wa address to lord chelmsford
through the offic in command at pretoria by a gentlemen whose
posit and long experi of the zulu and their mode of attack
should have carri some weight if it ever reach him he took to the
best of my recollect no notic of it whatev
but though some such disast wa daili expect by a few the major
of both soldier and civilian never dream of anyth of the sort
the gener idea be that the conquest of cetywayo wa a veri easi
undertak and the shock produc by the new of isandhlwana wa
proportion great especi as it reach pretoria in a much
exagger form i shall never forget the appear of the town that
morn busi wa entir suspend and the street were fill
with knot of men talk with scare face as well thei might for
there wa scarc anybodi but had lost a friend and mani thought that
their son or brother were among the dead on that bloodi field among
other sir t shepston lost on son and thought for some time that he
had lost three
shortli after thi event sir t shepston went to england to confer with
the secretari of state on variou matter connect with the transvaal
carri with him the affect and respect of all who knew him not
except the major of the malcont boer he wa succeed by
colonel now sir owen lanyon who wa appoint to administ the
govern dure the absenc of sir t shepston
by the boer howev the new of our disast wa receiv with great
and unconc rejoic or at least by the irreconcil portion of
that peopl england necess wa their opportun and on of which
thei certainli meant to avail themselv accordingli notic were sent
out summon the burgher of the transvaal to attend a mass meet on
the 18th march at a place about thirti mile from pretoria emissari
were also sent to nativ chief to excit them to follow cetywayo
exampl and massacr all the english within reach of whom a man call
solomon prinsloo wa on of the most activ the nativ howev
notwithstand the threat us toward them on and all declin the
invit
it must not be suppos that all the boer who attend these meet
did so of their own free will on the contrari a veri larg number came
under compuls sinc thei found that the english author were
powerless to give them protect the recalcitr were threaten
with all sort of pain and penalti if thei did not attend a
favourit menac be that thei should be made biltong of when the
countri wa given back ie be cut into strip and hung in the sun to
dry few luckili for themselv were brave enough to tempt fortun by
refus to come but those who did have had to leav the countri
sinc the war whatev were the mean emploi the result wa an arm
meet of about 3000 boer who evid meant mischief
just about thi time a corp had been rais in pretoria compos for
the most part of gentlemen and known as the pretoria hors for the
purpos of proceed to the zulu border where cavalri especi
cavalri acquaint with the countri wa earnestli need in the
emerg of the time offici were allow to join thi corp
a permiss of which i avail myself and wa elect on of the
lieuten the corp wa not after all allow to go to zululand
on account of the threaten aspect adopt by the boer against whom
it wa retain for servic in my capac as an offic of the corp i
wa sent out with a small bodi of pick men all good rider and light
weight to keep up a constant commun between the boer camp and
the administr and found the work both interest and excit my
headquart were at an inn about twentyf mile from pretoria to
which our agent in the meet us to come everi even and report
how matter were proceed whereupon if the road wa clear
i despatch a letter to headquart or if i fear that the
messeng would be caught en rout by boer patrol and search i
substitut differ colour ribbon accord to what i wish to
convei there wa a relief hidden in the tree or rock everi six
mile all dai and most of the night whose busi it wa to take the
despatch or ribbon and gallop on with it to the next station in which
wai we us to get the despatch into town in about an hour and a
quarter
it is customari in south african volunt forc to
allow the member to elect their own offic provid the
men elect ar such as the govern approv thi is
done so that the corp mai not afterward be abl to
declar that thei have no confid in their offic in
action or to grumbl at their treatment by them
on on or two occas the boer came to the inn and threaten to
shoot us but as our order were to do noth unless our live were
actual in danger we took no notic the offic who came out to
reliev me had not howev been there more than a dai or two befor he
and all hi trooper were hunt back into pretoria by a larg mob of
arm boer whom thei onli escap by veri hard ride
meanwhil the boer were by degre draw nearer and nearer to the
town till at last thei pitch their laager within six mile and
practic besieg it all busi wa stop the hous were
loophol and fortifi and advantag posit were occupi by the
militari and the variou volunt corp the build normal in
the occup of the govern mule fell to the lot of the pretoria
hors and though it wa undoubtedli a post of honour i honestli
declar that i have no wish to sleep for anoth month in a mule stabl
that ha not been clean out for sever year howev by sink
a well and erect bastion and a stage for sharpshoot we
convert it into an excel fortress though it would not have been
of much us against artilleri our patrol us to be out all night
sinc we chiefli fear a night attack and gener everi prepar
wa made to resist the onset that wa hourli expect and i believ
that it wa that state of prepared that alon prevent it
whilst thi meet wa go on and when matter had come to a point
that seem to render war inevit sir b frere arriv at pretoria
and had sever interview with the boer leader at which thei
persist in demand their independ and noth short of it
after a great deal of talk the meet final broke up without ani
actual appeal to arm though it had dure it continu assum
mani of the right of govern such as stop postcart and
individu and send arm patrol about the countri the princip
reason of it breakup wa that the zulu war wa now draw to a close
and the leader saw that there would soon be plenti of troop avail
to suppress ani attempt at revolt but thei also saw to what length
thei could go with impun thei had for a period of nearli two month
been allow to throw the whole countri into confus to openli
violat the law and to intimid and threaten her majesti loyal
subject with war and death the lesson wa not lost on them but thei
postpon action till a more favour opportun offer
sir bartl frere befor hi departur took an opportun at a public
dinner given him at potchefstroom of assur the loyal inhabit of
the countri that the transvaal would never be given back
meanwhil a new pharaoh had arisen in egypt in the shape of sir g
wolselei and on the 29th june 1879 we find him commun the fact
to sir o lanyon in veri plain languag tell him that he disapprov
of hi cours of action with regard to secocoeni and that in futur
you will pleas take order onli from me
as soon as sir garnet had complet hi arrang for the
pacif of zululand he proceed to pretoria and have caus
himself to be sworn in as governor set vigor to work i must sai
that in hi deal with the transvaal he show great judgment and a
keen appreci of what the countri need name strong govern
the fact of the matter be i suppos that be veri popular with
the home author he felt that he could more or less command their
support in what he did a satisfact not given to most governor
who never know but that thei mai be thrown overboard in emerg in
lighten the ship
on of hi first act wa to issu a proclam state that wherea
it appear that notwithstand repeat assur of the contrari
given by her majesti repres in thi territori uncertainti or
misapprehens exist amongst some of her majesti subject as to
the intent of her majesti govern regard the mainten of
british rule and sovereignti over the territori of the transvaal
and wherea it is expedi that all ground for such uncertainti or
misapprehens should be remov onc and for all beyond doubt or
question now therefor i do herebi proclaim and make known in the
name and on behalf of her majesti the queen that it is the will and
determin of her majesti govern that thi transvaal territori
shall be and shall continu to be for ever an integr portion of
her majesti dominion in south africa
ala sir g wolselei estim of the valu of a solemn pledg thu
made in the name of her majesti whose word ha hitherto been held to be
sacr differ greatli to that of mr gladston and hi govern
sir garnet wolselei oper against secocoeni prove emin
success and were the best arrang bit of nativ warfar that i have
yet heard of in south africa on blow wa struck and onli on but
that wa crush of cours the secret of hi success lai in the fact
that he had an abund of forc but it wa not ensur by that
alon good manag be veri requisit in an affair of the sort
especi where nativ alli have to be dealt with the cost of the
expedit not count other secocoeni war expenditur amount to
over 300000 pound all of which is now lost to thi countri
anoth step in the right direct undertaken by sir garnet wa the
establish of an execut council and also of a legisl council
for the establish of which letter patent were sent from down
street in novemb 1880
meanwhil the boer pai no attent to the latter proclam for
thei guess that it like other proclam in the transvaal would
be a mere brutum fulmen had assembl for anoth mass meet at
which thei went forward a step and declar a govern which wa to
treat with the english author thei had now learnt that thei could
do what thei like with perfect impun provid thei did not take
the extrem cours of massacr the english thei had yet to learn that
thei might even do that at the termin of thi meet a vote of
thank wa pass to mr leonard courtnei of london and other member
of the british parliament it wa wise of the boer leader to cultiv
mr courtnei of london as a result of thi meet pretoriu on of
the princip leader and bok the secretari were arrest on a
charg of treason and underw a preliminari examin but as the
secretari of state sir m hick beach look rather timidli on the
proceed and the local author were doubt of secur a
verdict the prosecut wa abandon and necessarili did more harm
than good be look upon as anoth proof of the impot of the
govern
shortli afterward sir g wolselei chang hi tactic and instead
of attempt to imprison pretoriu offer him a seat on the execut
council with a salari attach thi wa a much more sensibl wai
of deal with him and he at onc rose to the bait state hi
willing to join the govern after a while but that he could
not publicli do so at the moment lest he should lose hi influenc with
those who were to be brought round through him it doe not howev
appear that mr pretoriu ever did actual join the execut probabl
becaus he found public opinion too strong to allow him to do so
in decemb 1879 a new light broke upon the boer for in the previou
month mr gladston had been deliv hi note attack on the polici
of the conserv govern those midlothian speech did harm it
is said in mani part of the world but i ventur to think that thei
have prove more mischiev in south africa than anywher els at ani
rate thei have born fruit sooner it is not to be suppos that mr
gladston realli care anyth about the transvaal or it independ
when he wa denounc the hideou outrag that had been perpetr
by the conserv govern in annex it on the contrari as he
acquiesc in the annex at the time when lord kimberlei state
that it wa evid unavoid and declin to rescind it when he
came into power it is to be suppos that he realli approv of it or
at the least look on it as a necessari evil howev thi mai be ani
stick will do to beat a dog with and the transvaal wa a conveni
point on which to attack the govern he probabl neither knew
nor care what effect hi reckless word might have on ignor boer
thousand of mile awai and yet humanli speak mani a man would
have been aliv and strong todai whose bone now whiten the african
veldt had those word never been spoken then for the first time
the boer learnt that if thei plai their card properli and put
on suffici pressur thei would in the event of the liber parti
come to offic have littl difficulti in coerc it as thei wish
there wa a fair chanc at the time of the utter of the midlothian
speech that the agit would by degre die awai sir g wolselei
had succeed in win over pretoriu and the boer in gener
were sick of mass meet inde a memori wa address to sir g
wolselei by a number of boer in the potchefstroom district protest
against the mainten of the movement against her majesti rule
which consid the great amount of intimid exercis by the
malcont mai be look upon as a favour sign
but when it slowli came to be understood among the boer that a great
english minist had openli espous their caus and that he would
perhap soon be allpow the moral gain to them wa incalcul
thei could now go to the doubt on and sayw must be right about
the matter becaus put our own feel out of the question
the great gladston sai we ar we find the committe of the boer
malcont at their meet in march 1880 read a letter to mr
gladston in which he wa thank for the great sympathi shown to
their fate and a hope express that if he succeed in get
power he would not forget them in fact a charm unanim prevail
between our great minist and the boer rebel for their interest were
the same the overthrow of the conserv govern if howev
everi leader of the opposit were to intrigu or counten
intrigu with those who ar seek to undermin the author of her
majesti whether thei be boer or irishmen in order to help himself to
power the countri might suffer in the long run
but whatev feel mai have prompt her majesti opposit the
home govern and their agent sir garnet wolselei blew no uncertain
blast if we mai judg from their word and action thu we find
sir garnet speak as follow at a banquet given in hi honour at
pretoria
i am told that these men the boer ar told to keep on agit in
thi wai for a chang of govern in england mai give them again
the old order of thing noth can show greater ignor of english
polit than such an idea i tell you that there is no govern whig
or tori liber conserv or radic who would dare under ani
circumst to give back thi countri thei would not dare becaus
the english peopl would not allow them to give back the countri what
would it mean to give it back to extern danger to the danger of
attack by hostil tribe on it frontier and who if the english
govern were remov for on dai would make themselv felt the
next not an offici of govern paid for month it would mean
nation bankruptci no tax be paid the same thing recur again
which had exist befor would mean danger without anarchi and civil
war within everi possibl miseri the strangul of trade and the
destruct of properti
it is veri amus to read thi passag by the light of after event
on other occas sir garnet wolselei will probabl not be quit so
confid as to the futur when it is to be control by a radic
govern
thi explicit and straightforward statement of sir garnet produc
a great effect on the loyal inhabit of the transvaal which wa
heighten by the public of the follow telegram from the
secretari of statey mai fulli confirm explicit statement made
from the time to time as to inabl of her majesti govern to
entertain ani propos for withdraw of the queen sovereignti
on the faith of these declar mani englishmen migrat to the
transvaal and settl there whilst those who were in the countri now
invest all their mean be confid that thei would not lose
their properti through it be return to the boer the excit
produc by mr gladston speech began to quiet down and be
forgotten for the time arrear tax were paid up by the malcont
and gener the aspect of affair wa such in sir garnet wolselei
opinion as justifi him in write in april 1880 to the secretari of
state express hi belief that the agit wa dy out inde
so sanguin wa he on that point that he is report to have advis the
withdraw of the cavalri regiment station in the territori a piec
of economi that wa on of the immedi caus of the revolt
the reader will rememb the financi condit of the countri at the
time of the annex which wa on of utter bankruptci after three
year of british rule howev we find notwithstand the constant
agit that had been kept up that the total revenu receipt for
the first quarter of 1879 and 1880 amount to 22773 pound and 44982
pound respect that is to sai that dure the last year of
british rule the revenu of the countri more than doubl itself and
amount to about 160000 pound ayear take the quarterli return at
the low averag of 40000 pound it must howev be rememb that
thi sum would have been veri larg increas in subsequ year
most probabl doubl at ani rate the revenu would have been ampli
suffici to make the provinc on of the most prosper in south
africa and to have enabl it to shortli repai all debt due to the
british govern and further to provid for it own defenc trade
also which in april 1877 wa complet paralys had increas
enorm so earli as the middl of 1879 the committe of the
transvaal chamber of commerc point out in a resolut adopt by
them that the trade of the countri had in two year risen from almost
noth to the consider sum of two million sterl per annum and
that it wa entir in the hand of those favour to british rule
thei also point out that more than half the land tax wa paid by
englishmen or other european advers to boer govern land too
had risen greatli in valu of which i can give the follow instanc
about a year after the annex i togeth with a friend bought a
littl properti on the outskirt of pretoria which with a cottag
we put up on it cost some 300 pound just befor the rebellion we
fortun determin to sell it and had no difficulti in get 650
pound for it i do not believ that it would now fetch a fifti pound
note
in blue book no c 2866 of septemb 1881 which is
descript of variou event connect with the boer
rise is publish as an appendix a despatch from sir
garnet wolselei date octob 1879 thi despatch declar
the writer opinion that the boer discont is on the
increas it public thusapropo de bottesnearli
two year after it wa written is rather an amus
incid it certainli give on the idea that sir garnet
wolselei fear that hi reput for infal
might be attack by scoffer for not have foreseen the
boer rebellion and perhap uneasili consciou of other
despatch veri differ in tenor and subsequ in date
and mind of the withdraw of the cavalri regiment by
hi advic had caus it to be tack on to the blue book
as a documentari i told you so and a proof that whoever
els wa blind he foresaw it contain howev the
follow remark passageeven were it not imposs
for mani other reason to contempl a withdraw of our
author from the transvaal the posit of insecur in
which we should leav thi loyal and import section of
the commun the english inhabit by expos them to
the certain retali of the boer would constitut in
my opinion an insuper obstacl to retrocess
subject to the same danger moreov would be those of
the boer whose superior intellig and courag
charact ha render them loyal to our govern
as the govern took the troubl to publish the despatch
it is a piti that thei did not think fit to pai more
attent to it content
i cannot conclud thi chapter better than by draw attent to a
charm specimen of the correspond between the boer leader and
their friend mr courtnei the letter in question which is date 26th
june purport to be written by messr kruger and joubert but it is
obviou that it ow it origin to some member or member of the dutch
parti at the cape from whenc inde it is written thi is render
evid both by it gener style and also by the us of such term
as satrap and by refer to napoleon iii and cayenn about whom
messr kruger and joubert know no more than thei do of peru and the
inca
after allud to former letter the writer blow a blast of triumph
over the downfal of the conserv govern and then make a savag
attack on the reput of sir bartl frere the stubborn satrap is
throughout describ as a liar and everi bad motiv imput to him
realli the fact that mr courtnei should encourag such epistl as
thi is enough to give colour to the boast made by some of the lead
boer after the war that thei had been encourag to rebel by a member
of the british govern
at the end of thi letter and on the same page of the blue book is
print the telegram recal sir bartl frere date 1st august 1880
it realli read as though the second document wa consequ to the
first on thing is veri clear the feel of her majesti new
govern toward sir bartl frere differ onli in the method of their
express from those set forth by the boer leader in their letter
to mr courtnei whilst their object name to be rid of him wa
undoubtedli ident with that of the dutch parti in south africa

when the liber ministri becam an accomplish fact instead of a happi
possibl mr gladston did not find it conveni to adopt the line
of polici with refer to the transvaal that might have been expect
from hi utter whilst leader of the opposit on the contrari he
declar in parliament that the annex could not be cancel and
on the 8th june 1880 we find him in answer to a boer petit written
with the object of induc him to act up to the spirit of hi word and
rescind the annex write thuslook to all circumst
both of the transvaal and the rest of south africa and to the necess
of prevent a renew of disord which might lead to disastr
consequ not onli to the transvaal but to the whole of south
africa our judgment is that the queen cannot be advis to relinquish
her sovereignti over the transvaal but consist with the
mainten of that sovereignti we desir that the white inhabit of
the transvaal should without prejudic to the rest of the popul
enjoi the fullest liberti to manag their local affair we believ that
thi liberti mai be most easili and promptli conced to the transvaal
as a member of a south african confeder
unless word have lost their signif thi passag certainli mean
that the transvaal must remain a british coloni but that england will
be prepar to grant it respons govern more especi if it
will consent to a confeder scheme mr gladston howev in a
commun date 1st june 1881 and address to the unfortun
transvaal loyal for whom he express respect and sympathi
interpret hi mean thu it is state as i observ that a promis
wa given to me that the transvaal should never be given back there is
no mention of the term or date of thi promis if the refer be
to my letter of 8th june 1880 to messr kruger and joubert i do not
think the languag of that letter justifi the descript given nor
am i sure in what manner or to what degre the fullest liberti to manag
their local affair which i then said her majesti govern desir
to confer on the white popul of the transvaal differ from the
settlement now about be made in it bear on the interest of those
whom your committe repres
such twist of the mean of word would in a privat person be
call dishonest it will also occur to most peopl that mr gladston
might have spare the deepli wrong and loyal subject of her majesti
whom he wa address the taunt he level at them in the second
paragraph i have quot if ask he would no doubt sai that he had not
the slightest intent of laugh at them but when he deliber
tell them that it make no differ to their interest whether thei
remain her majesti subject under a respons govern or becom
the servant of men who were but late in arm against them and her
majesti author he is either mock them or offer an insult to
their understand
by wai of comment on hi remark i mai add that he had in a letter
repli to a petit from these same loyal inhabit address
to him in mai 1880 inform them that he had alreadi told the boer
repres that the annex could not be rescind although
mr gladston is undoubtedli the greatest live master of the art of
get two distinct and opposit set of mean out of on set of
word it would try even hi ingenu to make out to the satisfact
of an imparti mind that he never gave ani pledg about the retent
of the transvaal
inde it is from other consider clear that he had no intent
of give up the countri to the boer whose caus he appear to have
taken up sole for election purpos had he meant to do so
he would have carri out hi intent on succeed to offic and
inde as thing have turn out it is deepli to be regret that he
did not for bad as such a step would have been it would at ani rate
have had a better appear than our ultim surrend after three
defeat it would also have then been possibl to secur the repay
of some of the monei ow to thi countri and to provid for the
proper treatment of the nativ and the compens of the loyal
inhabit who could no longer live there sinc it must natur have
been easier to make term with the boer befor thei had defeat our
troop
on the other hand we should have miss the grandest and most
soulstir displai of radic theori practic appli that
ha as yet lighten the dark of thi countri but although mr
gladston gave hi offici decis against return the countri
there seem to be littl doubt that commun on the subject were
kept up with the boer leader through some promin member of the
radic parti whom it wa said went so far as to urg the boer to
take up arm against us when mr white came to thi countri on behalf
of the loyalist after the surrend he state that thi wa so at a
public meet and said further that he had in hi possess proof of
hi statement he even went so far as to name the gentleman he accus
and to challeng him to deni it i have not been abl to gather that mr
white statement were contradict
howev thi mai be after a paus agit in the transvaal suddenli
recommenc with redoubl vigour it began through a man name
bezuidenhout who refus to pai hi tax thereupon a waggon wa
seiz in execut under the author of the court and put up to
auction but it sale wa prevent by a crowd of rebel boer who
kick the auction off the waggon and drag the vehicl awai thi
wa on the 11th novemb 1880 when thi intellig reach pretoria
sir owen lanyon sent down a few compani of the 21st regiment under
the command of major thornhil to support the landdrost in arrest
the rioter and appoint captain raaf cmg to act as special
messeng to the landdrost court at potchefstroom with author
to enrol special constabl to assist him to carri out the arrest
on arriv at potchefstroom captain raaf found that without an arm
forc it wa quit imposs to effect ani arrest on the 26th
novemb sir owen lanyon realis the graviti of the situat
telegraph to sir georg collei ask that the 58th regiment should
be sent back to the transvaal sir georg repli that he could ill
spare it on account of daili expect outbreak of pondo and possibl
appeal for help from cape coloni and that the govern must be
support by the loyal inhabit
it will be seen that the boer had with some astut chosen a veri
favour time to commenc oper the hand of the cape govern
were full with the basutu war so no help could be expect from it sir
g wolselei had sent awai the onli cavalri regiment that remain in the
countri and lastli sir owen lanyon had quit recent allow a bodi
of 300 train volunt mostli if not altogeth drawn from among
the loyalist to be rais for servic in the basutu war a seriou
drain upon the resourc of a countri so spars popul as the

januari to consid mr gladston letter but the bezuidenhout

oclock a detach of the 94th wa ambush and destroi on the
road between middelburg and pretoria about eighti mile off by a forc
despatch from heidelburg for that purpos some dai befor on the
16th decemb or the same dai on which the triumvir had despatch
the proclam to pretoria contain their term and express in
the most solemn manner that thei had no desir to shed blood a larg
boer forc wa attack potchefstroom
so much then for the sincer of the profess of their desir to
avoid bloodsh
the proclam sent by sir o lanyon in repli recit in it preambl
the variou act of which the rebel had been guilti includ that
of have wickedli sought to incit the said loyal nativ inhabit
throughout the provinc to take up arm against her majesti
govern announc that matter had now been put into the hand of
the offic command her majesti troop and promis pardon to all
who would dispers to their home
it wa at potchefstroom which town had all along been the nurseri of
the rebellion that actual hostil first broke out potchefstroom as
a town is much more boer in it sympathi than pretoria which is
or rather wa almost pure english sir owen lanyon had as state
befor sent a small bodi of soldier thither to support the civil
author and had also appoint major clark cmg an offic
of note cool and abil to act as special commission for the
district
major clark first step wa to try in conjunct with captain raaf
to rais a corp of volunt in which he total fail those of the
townsfolk who were not boer at heart had too mani busi relat
with the surround farmer and perhap too littl faith in the
stabil of english rule after mr gladston utter to allow
them to indulg in patriot at the time of the outbreak between
seventi and eighti thousand sterl wa ow to firm in potchefstroom
by neighbour boer a sum ampli suffici to account for their
lukewarm in the english caus subsequ event have shown that the
potchefstroom shopkeep were wise in their gener
on the 15th decemb a larg number of boer came into the town and took
possess of the printingoffic in order to print the proclam
alreadi allud to major clark made two attempt to enter the offic
and see the leader but without success
on the 16th a boer patrol fire on some of the mount infantri and the
fire wa return these were the first shot fire dure the war and
thei were fire by boer order were thereupon signal to clark by
lieutenantcolonel winslo 21st regiment now command at the fort
which he afterward defend so gallantli that he wa to commenc
fire clark wa in the landdrost offic on the market squar with a
forc of about twenti soldier under captain fall and twenti civilian
under captain raaf cmg a posit but illsuit for defens
purpos from whenc fire wa accordingli open the boer take up
posit in the surround hous command the offic shortli after
the commenc of the fight captain fall wa shot dead whilst
talk to major clark the latter have a narrow escap a bullet
graze hi head just abov the ear the fight continu dure
the 17th and till the morn of the 18th when the boer succeed in
fire the roof which wa of thatch by throw firebal on to
it major clark then address the men tell them that though
person he did not care about hi own life he did not see that
thei could serv ani us purpos by be burn aliv so he should
surrend which he did with a loss of about six kill and wound
the camp meanwhil had repuls with loss the attack made on it and wa
never again directli attack
whilst these event were in progress at potchefstroom a much more aw
tragedi wa in prepar on the road between middelburg and pretoria
on the 23rd novemb colonel bellair at the request of sir owen
lanyon direct a concentr on pretoria of most of the few soldier
that there were in the territori in view of the disturb condit of
the countri in accord with these order colonel anstruth
march from lydenburg a town about 180 mile from pretoria on the 5th
decemb with the headquart and two compani of the 94th regiment
be a total of 264 men three women and two children and the
disproportion larg train of thirtyfour oxwaggon or an
oxwaggon capabl of carri five thousand pound weight to everi
eight person and here i mai remark that it is thi enorm amount of
baggag without which it appear to be imposs to move the smallest
bodi of men that render infantri regiment almost useless for servic
in south africa except for garrison purpos both zulu and boer
can get over the ground at thrice the pace possibl to the unfortun
soldier and both race despis them accordingli the zulu call our
infantri pack oxen in thi particular instanc colonel anstruth
defeat or rather annihil is to a veri great extent refer to
hi enorm baggag train sinc in the first place had he not lost
valuabl dai in collect more waggon he would have been safe in
pretoria befor danger aros it must also be acknowledg that hi
arrang on the line of march were somewhat reckless though it can
hardli be said that he wa ignor of hi danger thu we find that
colonel bellair wrote to colonel anstruth warn him of the
probabl of an attack and impress on him the necess of keep
a good lookout the letter be receiv and acknowledg by the
latter on the 17th decemb
to thi warn wa ad a still more impress on that came to
my knowledg privat a gentleman well known to me receiv on the
morn after the troop had pass through the town of middelburg on
their wai to pretoria a visit from an old boer with whom he wa on
friendli term who had purpos come to tell him that a larg patrol
wa out to ambush the troop on the pretoria road my inform have
convinc himself of the truth of the statement at onc rode after
the soldier and catch them up some distanc from middelburg told
colonel anstruth what he had heard implor him he said with
all the energi he could command to take better precaut against
surpris the colonel howev laugh at hi fear and told him that
if the boer came he would frighten them awai with the big drum
at on oclock on sundai the 20th decemb the column wa march
along about a mile and a half from a place known as bronker spruit
and thirtyeight mile from pretoria when suddenli a larg number of
mount boer were seen in loos format on the left side of the road
the band wa plai at the time and the column wa extend over more
than half a mile the rearguard be about a hundr yard behind
the last waggon the band stop plai on see the boer and the
troop halt when a man wa seen advanc with a white flag whom
colonel anstruth went out to meet accompani by conductor egerton
a civilian thei met about on hundr and fifti yard from the column
and the man gave colonel anstruth a letter which announc the
establish of the south african republ state that until thei
heard lanyon repli to their proclam thei did not know if thei
were at war or not that consequ thei could not allow ani
movement of troop which would be taken as a declar of war thi
letter wa sign by joubert on of the triumvir colonel anstruth
repli that he wa order to pretoria and to pretoria he must go
whilst thi confer wa go on the boer of whom there were
quit five hundr had gradual close round the column and took up
posit behind rock and tree which afford them excel cover
whilst the troop were on a bare plain and befor colonel anstruth
reach hi men a murder fire wa pour in upon them from all side
the fire wa hotli return by the soldier most of the offic were
struck down by the first vollei have no doubt been pick out by
the marksmen the fire last about fifteen minut and at the end of
that time seven out of the nine offic were down kill and wound
an eighth captain elliot on of two who escap untouch be
reserv for an even more aw fate the major of the men were also
down and had the hail of lead continu much longer it is clear that
nobodi would have been left colonel anstruth who wa ly badli
wound in five place see what a hopeless state affair were in
order the bugler to sound the ceas fire and surrend on of
the three offic who were not much hurt wa most providenti dr
ward who had but a slight wound in the thigh all the other except
captain elliot and on lieuten were either kill or di from
the effect of their wound there were altogeth 56 kill and 101
wound includ a woman mr fox twenti more afterward di of
their wound the boer loss appear to have been veri small
after the fight conductor egerton with a sergeant wa allow to walk
into pretoria to obtain medic assist the boer refus to give
him a hors or even to allow him to us hi own the boer leader also
left dr ward eighteen men and a few store for the wound with which
he made shift as best he could nobodi can read thi gentleman report
without be much impress with the wai in which though wound
himself he got through hi terribl task of without assist

it took him till six the next morn befor he had seen the last man
it is to be hope that hi servic have met with some recognit dr

the declar of peac when he brought them down to maritzburg
have experienc great difficulti in obtain food for them dure so
mani week
thi is a short account of what i must with reluct call a most
cruel and carefulli plan massacr i mai mention that a zulu driver
who wa with the rearguard and escap into natal state that the
boer shot all the wound men who form that bodi hi statement wa
to a certain extent born out by the evid of on of the survivor
who state that all the bodi found in that part of the field nearli
threequart of a mile awai from the head of the column had a bullet

in view of the circumst of the treacher hem in and

think thi languag rather highflown not to sai blasphem
on the new of thi disast reach pretoria sir owen lanyon issu
a proclam place the countri under martial law as the town
wa larg straggl and incap of defenc all the inhabit
amount to over four thousand soul were order up to camp where
the best arrang possibl were made for their conveni in these
quarter thei remain for three month driven from their comfort
home and cheerfulli endur all the hardship want and discomfort
consequ on their posit whilst thei wait in patienc for the
appear of that reliev column that never came peopl in england
hardli understand what these men and women went through becaus thei
chose to remain loyal let them suppos that all the inhabit of an
ordinari english town with the except of the class known as poor
peopl which can hardli be said to exist in a coloni were at an hour
notic orderedal the ag and the sick delic women and tini
childrento leav their home to the merci of the enemi and crowd up
in a littl space under shelter of a fort with noth but canva tent
or shed to cover them from the fierc summer sun and rain and the
coarsest ration to feed them whilst the husband and brother were
daili engag with a cun and danger enemi and sometim brought
home wound or dead thei will then have some idea of what wa gone
through by the loyal peopl of pretoria in their weak confid in the
good faith of the english govern
the arrang made for the defenc of the town were so abli and
energet carri out by sir owen lanyon assist by the militari
offic that no attack upon it wa ever attempt it seem to me that
the organis that could provid for the pen up of four thousand
peopl for month and carri it out without the occurr of a singl
unpleas or express of discont must have had someth
remark about it of cours it would have been imposs without
the most loyal cooper on the part of those concern inde
everybodi in the town lent a help hand judg serv out ration
member of the execut inspect nuisanc and so forth there wa
onli on instanc of strike and then of all peopl in the world
it wa the five civil doctor who think it a favour opportun
to fleec the govern combin to demand five guinea adai each
for their servic i am glad to sai that thei did not succe in their
attempt at extort
on the 23d decemb the boer leader issu a second proclam in
repli to that of sir o lanyon of the 18th which is characteris by
an utter absenc of regard for the truth be in fact noth but
a tissu of impud falsehood it accus sir o lanyon of have
bombard women and children of arm nativ against the boer
and of fire on the boer without declar war not on of these
accus ha ani foundat in fact as the boer well knew but
thei also knew that sir owen be shut up in pretoria wa not in a
posit to rebut their charg which thei hope might to some extent
be believ and creat sympathi for them in other part of the world
thi wa the reason for the issu of the proclam which well
portrai the charact of it framer
life at pretoria wa vari by occasion sorti against the boer
laager situat at differ point in the neighbourhood gener
about six or eight mile from the town these expedit were carri
out with consider success though with some loss the heaviest
incur be when the boer have treacher hoist the white
flag open a heavi fire on the pretoria forc as soon as thei
beguil into confid emerg from their cover in the cours of the
war on in everi four of the pretoria mount volunt wa kill or
wound
but perhap the most seriou of all the difficulti the govern had
to meet wa that of keep the nativ in check as ha befor been
state thei were devotedli attach to our rule and dure the three
year of it continu had undergon what wa to them a strang
experi thei had neither been murder beaten or enslav
natur thei were in no hurri to return to the old order of thing in
which murder flog and slaveri were event of everydai occurr
nor did the behaviour of the boer on the outbreak of the war tend
to reconcil them to ani such idea thu we find that the farmer had
press a number of nativ from waterberg into on of their laager
zwart koppi two of them tri to run awai a boer saw them and
shot them both again on the 7th januari a nativ report to the
author at pretoria that he and some other were return from the
diamond field drive some sheep a boer came and ask them to sell
the sheep thei refus whereupon he went awai but return with some
other dutchmen fire on the kafir kill on
on the 2d januari inform reach pretoria that on the 26th decemb
some boer fire on some nativ who were rest outsid potchefstroom
and kill three the rest fled whereupon the boer took the cattl
thei had with them
on the 11th januari some men who had been sent from pretoria with
despatch for standerton were taken prison whilst prison thei
saw ten men return from the field stop by the boer and order

on of the first act of the triumvir wa to despatch a larg forc
from heidelberg with order to advanc into natal territori and seiz
the pass over the drakensberg known as lang nek so as to disput the
advanc of ani reliev column thi movement wa promptli execut
and strong boer troop patrol natal countri almost up to newcastl
the new of the outbreak follow as it wa by that of the bronker
spruit massacr and captain elliot murder creat a great excit
in natal all avail soldier were at onc despatch up countri
togeth with a naval brigad who on arriv at newcastl brought up
the strength of the imperi troop of all arm to about a thousand men
on the 10th januari sir georg collei left maritzburg to join the forc
at newcastl but at thi time nobodi dreamt that he meant to attack the
nek with such an insignific column it wa known that the loyal
and troop who were shut up in the variou town in the transvaal
had suffici provis to last for some month and that there wa
therefor noth to necessit a forlorn hope inde the possibl
of sir georg collei attempt to enter the transvaal wa not even
specul upon until just befor hi advanc it be gener
consid as out of the question
the best illustr i can give of the feel that exist about the
matter is to quot my own case i had been so unfortun as to land in
natal with my wife and servant just as the transvaal troubl began
my intent be to proce to a place i had near newcastl for some
week i remain in maritzburg but find that the troop were to
concentr on newcastl and be besid heartili weari of the
great expens and discomfort of hotel life in that town i determin
to go on up countri look on it as be as safe as ani place in the
coloni of cours the possibl of sir georg attack the nek befor
the arriv of the reinforc did not enter into my calcul as
i thought it a ventur that no sensibl man would undertak on the dai
of my start howev there wa a rumour about the town that the gener
wa go to attack the boer posit though i did not believ it
i thought it as well to go and ask the coloni secretari colonel
mitchel privat if there wa ani truth in it ad that if
there wa as i had a pretti intim knowledg of the boer and their
shoot power and what the inevit result of such a move would be
i should certainli prefer as i had ladi with me to remain where i
wa colonel mitchel told me frankli that he knew no more about sir
georg plan than i did but he ad i might be sure that so abl and
prudent a soldier would not do anyth rash hi remark concur with
my own opinion so i start and on arriv at newcastl a week later
wa met by the intellig that sir georg had advanc that morn to
attack the nek to return wa almost imposs sinc both hors
and travel were pretti nearli knock up also anybodi who ha
travel with hi famili in summertim over the aw track of
altern slough and boulder between maritzburg and newcastl known in
the coloni as a road will understand that at the time the adventur
voyag would far rather risk be shot than face a return journei
the onli thing to do under the circumst wa to await the cours
of event which were now about to develop themselv with startl
rapid the littl town of newcastl wa at thi time an odd sight
and remain so all through the war the hotel were crowd to
overflow with refuge and on everi spare patch of land were erect
tent mud hut canva hous and everi kind of cover that could
be utilis under the pressur of necess to hous the mani homeless
famili who had succeed in effect their escap from the transvaal
mani of whom were reduc to great strait
on the morn of the 28th januari anybodi listen attent in the
neighbourhood of newcastl could hear the distant boom of heavi gun we
were not kept long in suspens for in the afternoon new arriv
that sir georg had attack the nek and fail with heavi loss
the excit in the town wa intens for in addit to other
consider the 58th regiment which had suffer most had been
quarter there for some time and both the offic and men were
person known to the inhabit
the stori of the fight is well known and need littl repetit and a
sad stori it is the boer who at that time were some 2000 strong were
post and entrench on steep hill against which sir georg collei
hurl a few hundr soldier it wa a forlorn hope but so gallant
wa the charg especi that of the mount squadron led by major
bronlow that at on time it nearli succeed but noth could stand
under the wither fire from the boer schans and as regard the foot
soldier thei never had a chanc colonel dean tri to take them up
the hill with a rush with the result that by the time thei reach the
top some of the men were actual sick from exhaust and none could
hold a rifl steadi there on the bare hilltop thei crouch and lai
while the pitiless fire from redoubt and rock lash them like hail
till at last human natur could bear it no longer and what wa left of
them retir slowli down the slope but for mani that gallant charg
wa their last earthli action as thei charg thei fell and where thei
fell thei were afterward buri the casualti kill and wound
amount to 195 which consid the small number of troop engag
in the actual attack is enorm heavi and show more plainli than
word can tell the desper natur of the undertak amongst the
kill were colonel dean major pool major hingeston and lieuten
elw major essex wa the onli staff offic engag who escap
the same offic who wa on of the fortun four who live through
isandhlwana on thi occas hi usual good fortun attend him
for though hi hors wa kill and hi helmet knock off he wa not
touch the boer loss wa veri trivial
sir georg collei in hi admir lucid despatch about thi occurr
address to the secretari of state for war doe not enter much into
the question as to the motiv that prompt him to attack simpli
state that hi object wa to reliev the besieg town he doe not
appear to have taken into consider what wa obviou to anybodi who
knew the countri and the boer that even if he had succeed in forc
the nek in itself almost an imposs he could never have oper
with ani success in the transvaal with so small a column without
cavalri and with an enorm train of waggon he would have been
harass dai and night by the boer skirmish hi suppli cut off
and hi advanc made practic imposs also the nek would have
been reoccupi behind him sinc he could not have detach suffici
men to hold it and in all probabl newcastl hi base of suppli
would have fallen into the hand of the enemi
the moral effect of our defeat on the boer wa veri great up to thi
time there had been mani secret doubt amongst a larg section of them
as to what the upshot of an encount with the troop might be and with
thi parti in the same wai that defeat or even the anxieti of wait
to be attack would have turn the scale on wai victori turn it
the other it gave them unbound confid in their own superior
and infus a spirit of cohes and mutual relianc into their rank
which had befor been want waver waver no longer but gave a
loyal adher to the good caus and what wa still more accept
larg number of volunteerswhatev presid brand mai sai to the
contrarypour in from the orang free state
what sir georg collei motiv wa in make so rash a move is of
cours quit inexplic to the outsid observ it wa said at the
time in natal that he wa a man with a theori name that small bodi
of men properli handl were as us and as like to obtain the
object in view as a larg forc whether or no thi wa so i am not
prepar to sai but it is undoubtedli the case that veri clever men
have sometim veri odd theori and it mai be that he wa a strike
instanc in point
for some dai after the battl at lang nek affair were quiet and
it wa hope that thei would remain so till the arriv of the
reinforc which were on their wai out the hope prove a vain
on on the 7th februari it wa report that the escort proceed
from newcastl to the gener camp with the post a distanc of about
eighteen mile had been fire on and forc to return
on the 8th about middai we were all startl by the sound of
fight proceed appar from a hill known as schein hoogt
about ten mile from newcastl it wa not know that the gener
contempl ani move and everybodi wa entir at a loss to know what
wa go on the gener idea be howev that the camp near lang
nek had been abandon and that sir georg wa retir on newcastl
the fire grew hotter and hotter till at last it wa perfectli
continu the cannon evid be discharg as quickli as thei
could be load whilst their dull boom wa accompani by the
unceas crash and roll of the musketri toward three oclock the
fire slacken and we thought it wa all over on wai or the other
but about five oclock it broke out again with increas vigour at dusk
it final ceas about thi time some kafir came to my hous and told
us that an english forc wa hem in on a hill thi side of the
ingogo river that thei were fight brave but that their arm were
tire ad that thei thought thei would be all kill at night
needless to sai we spent that night with heavi heart expect everi
minut to hear the fire begin again and ignor of what fate had
befallen our poor soldier on the hill morn put an end to our
suspens and we then learnt that we had suffer what under the
circumst amount to a crush defeat it appear that sir georg
had move out with a forc of five compani of the 60th regiment two
gun and a few mount men to in hi own word patrol the road
and meet and escort some waggon expect from newcastl as soon as
he pass the ingogo he wa surround by a bodi of boer sent after him
from lang nek on a small triangular plateau and sharpli assail
on all side with a break of about two hour from three to five the
assault wa kept up till nightfal with veri bad result so far as we
were concern see that out of a bodi of about 500 men over 150
were kill and wound the reinforc sent for from the camp
appar did not come into action for some unexplain reason the
boer did not follow up their attack that night perhap becaus thei
did not think it possibl that our troop could effect their escap back
to the camp and consid that the next morn would be soon enough
to return and finish the busi the gener howev determin to
get back and scratch team of such mule ridinghors and oxen as
had live through the dai be har to the gun the dispirit
and exhaust survivor of the forc manag to ford the ingogo now
swollen by rain which had fallen in the afternoon poor lieuten
wilkinson the adjut of the 60th lose hi life in the oper
and to struggl through the dens dark back to camp
on the hilltop thei had late held the dead lai thick there too
expos to the drive rain and bitter wind lai the wound mani of
whom would be dead befor the rise of the morrow sun it must
inde have been a sight never to be forgotten by those who saw it the
nighti rememb wellwa cold and raini the great expans of hill
and plain be sometim lit by the broken gleam of an uncertain moon
and sometim plung into intensest dark by the pass of a heavi
cloud now and again flash of lightn threw everi crag and outlin
into vivid relief and the deep mutter of distant thunder made the
wild gloom more solemn then a gust of ici wind would come tear down
the vallei to be follow by a pelt thunder showerand thu the
night wore awai
when on reflect what discomfort and even danger an ordinari healthi
person would suffer if left after a hard dai work to lie all night in
the rain and wind on the top of a stoni mountain without food or
even water to assuag hi thirst it becom to some degre possibl to
realis what the suffer of our wound after the battl of ingogo
must have been those who surviv were next dai taken to the hospit
at newcastl
what sir georg collei real object wa in expos himself to the
attack ha never transpir it can hardli have been to clear the road
as he sai in hi despatch becaus the road wa not held by the enemi
but onli visit occasion by their patrol the result of the battl
wa to make the boer whose loss were trifl more confid than
ever and to greatli depress our soldier sir georg had now lost
between three and four hundr men out of hi column of littl over
a thousand which wa therebi entir crippl of hi staff offic
major essex now alon surviv hi usual good fortun have carri
him safe through the battl of ingogo what make hi repeat escap
the more remark is that he wa gener to be found in the heaviest
fire a man so fortun as major essex ought to be reward for hi
good fortun if for no other reason though if report ar true
there would be no need to fall back on that to find ground on which to
advanc a soldier who ha alwai born himself so well
anoth result of the ingogo battl wa that the boer know that we
had no forc to cut them off and alwai secur of a retreat into
the free state pass round newcastl in free state territori and
descend from fifteen hundr to two thousand strong into natal for the
purpos of destroi the reinforc which were now on their wai up
under gener wood thi wa on the 11th of februari and from that date
till the 18th the upper district of natal were in the hand of the
enemi who cut the telegraph wire loot waggon stole herd of
cattl and hors and otherwis amus themselv at the expens of her
majesti subject in natal
it wa a veri anxiou time for those who knew what boer ar capabl of
and had women and children to protect and who were never sure if their
hous would be left stand over their head from on dai to anoth
everi night we were oblig to place out kafir as scout to give us
time warn of the approach of maraud parti and to sleep with
load rifl close to our hand and sometim when thing look veri
black in our cloth with hors readi saddl in the stabl nor were
our fear groundless for on dai a patrol of some five hundr boer
encamp on the next place which by the wai belong to a dutchman
and stole all the stock on it the properti of an englishman thei also
intercept a train of waggon destroi the content and burnt them
numer were the fals alarm it wa our evil fortun to experi
for instanc on night i wa sit in the drawingroom read about
eleven oclock with a door lead on to the verandah slightli ajar
for the night wa warm when suddenli i heard myself call by name in
a muffl voic and ask if the place wa in the possess of the
boer look toward the door i saw a fullcock revolv come
round the corner and on open it in some alarm i could indistinctli
discern a line of arm figur in a crouch attitud stretch along
the verandah into the garden beyond it turn out to be a patrol of
the mount polic who had receiv inform that a larg number of
boer had seiz the place and had come to ascertain the truth of the
report as we gather from them that the boer were certainli near we
did not pass a veri comfort night
meanwhil we were daili expect to hear that the troop had been
attack along the line of march and know the natur of the countri
and the mani opportun it afford for ambuscad and destroi on
of our straggl column encumb with innumer waggon we had
the worst fear for the result at length a report reach us to the
effect that the reinforc were expect on the morrow and that
thei were not go to cross the ingagaan at the ordinari drift which
wa much command by hill but at a lower drift on our own place
about three mile from newcastl which wa onli slightli command we
also heard that it wa the intent of the boer to attack them at thi
point and to fall back on my hous and the hill beyond accordingli we
thought it about time to retreat and secur a few valuabl such as
plate we made our wai into the town leav the hous and it content
to take their chanc at newcastl an attack wa daili expect if for
no other reason to obtain possess of the store collect there
the defenc of the place were howev in a wretch condit
no proper outlook wa kept and there wa an utter want of effect
organis the militari element at the camp had enough to do to look
after itself and did not concern itself with the safeti of the town
and the mount policea coloni forc paid by the colonyhad been
withdrawn from the littl fort round newcastl as the gener want
them for other purpos and a messag sent that the town must defend
it own fort there were it is true a larg number of ablebodi men
in the place who were will to fight but thei had no organis
the veri laager wa not finish until the danger wa past
then there wa a larg parti who were for surrend the town to the
boer becaus if thei fought it might afterward injur their trade
with thi section of the popul the feel of patriot wa
strong no doubt but that of pocket wa stronger i am convinc that
the boer would have found the captur of newcastl an easi task and i
confess that what i then saw did not inspir me with great hope of the
safeti of the coloni when it get respons govern and ha to
depend for protect on burgher forc coloni volunt forc ar
i think as good troop as ani in the world but an unorganis coloni
mob pull thi wai and that by differ sentiment and interest
is as useless as ani other mob with the differ that it is more
impati of control
for some unknown reason the boer leader providenti chang their
mind about attack the reinforc and their men were withdrawn
to the nek as swiftli and silent as thei had been advanc and on
the 17th februari the reinforc march into newcastl to the veri
great relief of the inhabit who had been equal anxiou for their
own safeti and that of the troop person i wa never in my life
more pleas to see her majesti uniform and we were equal rejoic
on return home to find that noth had been injur after thi we
had quiet for a while
on the 21st februari we heard that two fresh regiment had been sent up
to the camp at lang nek and that gener wood had been order down
countri by sir georg collei to bring up more reinforc thi item
of new caus much surpris as nobodi could understand why now that
the road wa clear and that there wa littl chanc of it be again
block a gener should be sent down to do work which could to all
appear have been equal well done by the offic in command
of the reinforc regiment with the assist of their transport
rider it wa howev understood that an agreement had been enter
into between the two gener that no offens oper should be
undertaken till wood return
with the except of occasion scare there wa no further excit
till sundai the 27th februari when whilst sit on the verandah
after lunch i thought i heard the sound of distant artilleri other
present differ with me think the sound wa caus by thunder but
as i adher to my opinion we determin to ride into town and see
on arriv there we found the place full of rumour from which we
gather that some fresh disast had occur and that messag were
pour down the wire from mount prospect camp we then went on to
camp think that we should learn more there but thei knew noth
about it sever offic ask us what new shave we had got hold
of a consider number of troop had been march from newcastl that
morn to go to mount prospect but when it wa realis that someth
had occur thei were stop and march back again bit by bit we
manag to gather the truth at first we heard that our men had made a
most gallant resist on the hill mow down the advanc enemi by
hundr till at last their ammunit fail thei fought with
their bayonet us stone and meat tin as missil i wish that our
subsequ inform had been to the same effect
it appear that on the even of the 26th sir georg collei after
mess suddenli gave order for a forc of a littl over six hundr men
consist of detach from no less than three differ regiment
the 58th 60th 92d and the naval brigad to be got readi for an
expedit without reveal hi plan to anybodi until late in the
afternoon and then without more ado march them up to the top of
majubaa great squaretop mountain to the right of and command
the boer posit at lang nek the troop reach the top about three
in the morn after a somewhat exhaust climb and were station at
differ point of the plateau in a scientif wai whilst the dark
last thei could by the glitter of the watchfir trace from
thi point of vantag the posit of the boer laager that lai 2000
yard beneath them whilst the dawn of dai reveal everi detail of the
defens work and show the countri ly at their feet like a map
on arriv at the top it wa repres to the gener that a rough
entrench should be thrown up but he would not allow it to be done
on account of the men be weari with their march up thi wa a
fatal mistak behind an entrench howev slight on would think
that 600 english soldier might have defi the whole boer armi and
much more the 200 or 300 men by whom thei were hunt down majuba it
appear that about 1015 am colonel steward and major fraser
again went to gener collei to arrang to start the sailor on an
entrench find the ground so expos the gener did not
give order to entrench
as soon as the boer found out that the hill wa in the occup of
the english their first idea wa to leav the nek and thei began
to inspan with that object but discov that there were no gun
command them thei chang their mind and set to work to storm the
hill instead as far as i have been abl to gather the number of boer
who took the mountain wa about 300 or possibl 400 i do not think
there were more than that the boer themselv declar solemnli that
thei were onli 100 strong but thi i do not believ thei slowli
advanc up the hill till about 1130 when the real attack began
the dutchmen come on more rapidli and confid and shoot with
everincreas accuraci as thei found our fire quit ineffect
about a quarter to on our men retreat to the last ridg and gener
collei wa shot through the head after thi the retreat becam a rout
and the soldier rush pellmel down the precipit side of the
hill the boer knock them over by the score as thei went till thei
were out of rang a few were also i heard kill by the shell from
the gun that were advanc from the camp to cover the retreat but as
thi doe not appear in the report perhap it is not true our loss
wa about 200 kill and wound includ sir georg collei dr
landon and cornish and command romilli who wa shot with an
explos bullet and di after some dai suffer when the wound
command wa be carri to a more shelter spot it wa with great
difficulti that the boer were prevent from massacr him as he lai
thei be under the impress that he wa sir garnet wolselei as wa
the case at ingogo the wound were left on the battlefield all night
in veri inclement weather to which some of them succumb it is
worthi of note that after the fight wa over thei were treat with
consider kind by the boer
not be a soldier of cours i cannot ventur to give ani militari
reason as to how it wa that what wa after all a consider forc
wa so easili driven from a posit of great natur strength but
i think i mai without presumpt state my opinion wa to the real
caus which wa the villan shoot of the british soldier though
the troop did not as wa said at the time run short of ammunit
it is clear that thei fire awai a great mani round at men who in
storm the hill must necessarili have expos themselv more or
less of whom thei manag to hitcertainli not more than six or
sevenwhich wa the outsid of the boer casualti from thi it is
clear that thei can neither judg distanc nor hit a move object nor
did thei probabl know that when shoot down hill it is necessari to
aim low such shoot as the english soldier is capabl of mai be
veri well when he ha an armi to aim at but it is useless in guerilla
warfar against a foe skill in the us of the rifl and the art of
take shelter
a coupl of month after the storm of majuba i togeth with a
friend had a convers with a boer a volunt from the free state
in the late war and on of the detach that storm majuba who gave
us a circumstanti account of the attack with the greatest willing
he said that when it wa discov that the english had possess
of the mountain thei thought that the game wa up but after a while
bolder counsel prevail and volunt were call for to storm the
hill onli seventi men could be found to perform the duti of whom he
wa on thei start up the mountain in fear and trembl but soon
found that everi shot pass over their head and went on with greater
bold onli three men he declar were hit on the boer side
on wa kill on wa hit in the arm and he himself wa the third
get hi face graze by a bullet of which he show us the scar he
state that the first to reach the top ridg wa a boi of twelv and
that as soon as the troop saw them thei fled when he said he paid
them out for have nearli kill him knock them over on after
anoth like buck as thei ran down the hill ad that it wa
alter lecker veri nice he ask us how mani men we had lost dure
the war and when we told him about seven hundr kill and wound
laugh in our face sai he knew that our dead amount to sever
thousand on our assur him that thi wa not the case he repli
well dont let talk of it ani more becaus we ar good friend now
and if we go on you will lie and i shall lie and then we shall
get angri the war is over now and i dont want to quarrel with the
english if on of them take off hi hat to me i alwai acknowledg
it he did not mean ani harm in talk thu it is what englishmen
have to put up with now in south africa the boer have beaten us and
act accordingli
thi man also told us that the major of the rifl thei pick up
were sight for 400 yard wherea the latter part of the fight had
been carri on within 200
sir georg collei death wa much lament in the coloni where he wa
deservedli popular inde anybodi who had the honour of know that
kindheart gentleman could not do otherwis than deepli regret hi
untim end what hi motiv wa in occupi majuba in the wai he did
ha never so far as i am awar transpir the move in itself would
have been an excel on had it been made in forc or accompani
by a direct attack on the nekbut as undertaken seem to have been
objectless there were of cours mani rumour as to the motiv that
prompt hi action of which the most probabl seem to be that be
awar of what the home govern intend to do with refer to the
transvaal he determin to strike a blow to try and establish british
supremaci first know how mischiev ani appar surrend would
be whatev hi fault mai have been as a gener he wa a brave man
and had the honour of hi countri much at heart
it wa also said by soldier who saw him the night the troop march
up majuba that the gener wa not himself and it wa hint that
continu anxieti and the chagrin of failur had told upon hi mind as
against thi howev must be set the fact that hi telegram to the
secretari of state for war the last of which he must have despatch
onli about halfanhour befor he wa shot ar cool and collect
and written in the same unconcern tonea though he were a
critic spectat of an interest scenethat characteris all hi
commun more especi hi despatch thei at ani rate give no
evid of shaken nerv or unduli excit brain nor can i see that
ani action of hi with refer to the occup of majuba is out of
keep with the detail of hi generalship upon other occas he wa
alwai confid to rash and possess by the idea that everi
man in the rank wa full of as high a spirit and as brave as he wa
himself inde most peopl will think that so far from it be a
rasher action the occup of majuba bad generalship as it seem
wa a wiser move than either the attack on the nek or the ingogo fiasco
but at the best all hi movement ar difficult to be understand by
a civilian though thei mai for ought we know have been part of an
elabor plan perfect in accord with the rule of militari
scienc of which it is said he wa a great student

thi gentleman ha for mani year been at the head of the govern of
the orang free state whose fortun he had direct with consider
abil he is a man of natur talent and kindheart disposit and
ha the advanc of the boer caus in south africa much at heart the
rise in the transvaal wa an event that gave him a great and threefold
opportun first of interf with the genuin benevol object
of check bloodsh secondli of advanc the dutch caus throughout
south africa under the cloak of amiabl neutral and strike a
danger blow at british supremaci over the dutch and british prestig
with the nativ and thirdli of put the english govern under
a last oblig to him of thi opportun he ha avail himself
to the utmost in each particular
so soon as thing began to look seriou mr brand put himself into
activ telegraph commun with the variou british author
with the view of prevent bloodsh by induc the english govern
to acced to the boer demand he wa also earnest in hi declar
that the free state wa not support the transvaal which consid
that it wa practic the insurg base of suppli where thei had
retir their women children and cattl and that it furnish them
with a larg number of volunt wa perhap strain the truth
about thi time also we find lord kimberlei telegraph to mr brand
that if onli the transvaal boer will desist from arm opposit to
the queen author he think some arrang might be made thi
is the first indic made public of what wa pass in the mind
of her majesti govern on whom it radic support were now
begin to put the screw to induc or threaten them into submit
to the boer demand
again on the 11th januari the presid telegraph to lord kimberlei
through the orang free state consul in london suggest that sir
h de villier the chief justic at the cape should be appoint a
commission to go to the transvaal to settl matter oddli enough
about the same time the same proposit eman from the dutch parti
in the cape coloni head by mr hofmey a coincid that inclin
on to the opinion that these friend of the boer had some further
reason for thu urg sir henri de villier appoint as
commission beyond hi appar fit for the post of which hi
high reput as a lawyer and in hi privat capac wa a suffici
guarante
the explan is not hard to find the fact be that rightli or
wrongli sir henri de villier who is himself of dutch descent is
note throughout south africa for hi sympathi with the boer caus
and both presid brand and the dutch parti in the cape shrewdli
suspect that if the settl of differ were left to hi
discret the boer and their interest would receiv veri gentl
handl the cours of action adopt by him when he becam a member
of the royal commiss went far to support thi view for it will be
notic in the report of the commission that in everi singl point he
appear to have taken the boer side of the content inde so blind
wa he to their fault that he would not even admit that the horribl
potchefstroom murder and atroc which ar condemn both by sir h
robinson and sir evelyn wood in languag as strong as the formal term
of a report will allow were act contrari to the rule of civilis
warfar if those act had been perpetr by englishmen on boer or
even on nativ i ventur to think sir henri de villier would have
look at them in a veri differ light
in the same telegram in which presid brand recommend the appoint
of sir henri de villier he state that the alleg made by the
triumvir in the proclam in which thei accus sir owen lanyon
of commit variou atroc deserv to be investig as thei
maintain that the collis wa commenc by the author nobodi
knew better than mr brand that ani english offici would be quit
incap of the conduct ascrib to sir owen lanyon whilst even
if the collis had been commenc by the author which as it
happen it wa not thei would under the circumst have been ampli
justifi in so commenc it thi remark by presid brand in hi
telegram wa mere an attempt to throw an air of probabl over a
seri of slander falsehood
messag of thi natur continu to pour along the wire from dai
to dai but the tone of those from the coloni offic grew gradual
humbler thu we find lord kimberlei telegraph on the 8th februari
that if the boer would desist from arm opposit all reason
guarante would be given as to their treatment after submiss and
that a scheme would be frame for the perman friendli settlement of
difficulti it will be seen that the govern had alreadi begun
to water the mean of their declar that thei would vindic her
majesti author no doubt mr chamberlain mr courtnei and their
follow had given anoth turn to the radic screw
it is howev clear that at thi time no idea of the real aim of the
govern had enter into the mind of sir georg collei sinc on the
7th februari he telegraph home a plan which he propos to adopt on
enter the transvaal which includ a suggest that he should grant
a complet amnesti onli to those boer who would sign a declar of
loyalti
in answer to thi he wa order to do noth of the sort but to
promis protect to everybodi and refer everyth home
then came the battl of ingogo which check for the time the flow of
telegram or rather vari their natur for those despatch dure
the next few dai deal with the question of reinforc on the 13th
februari howev negoti were reopen by paul kruger on of
the triumvir who offer if all the troop were order to withdraw
from the transvaal to give them a free passag through the nek to
dispers the boer and to consent to the appoint of a commiss
the offer wa jump at by lord kimberlei who without make refer
to the question of withdraw the soldier offer if onli the boer
would dispers to appoint a commiss with extens power to develop
the perman friendli settlement scheme the telegram end thu
add that if thi propos is accept you now ar authoris to agre
to suspens of hostil on our part thi messag wa sent to
gener wood becaus the boer had stop the commun with
collei on the 19th sir georg collei repli in these word which
show hi astonish at the polici adopt by the home govern and
which in the opinion of most peopl redound to hi credit
latter part of your telegram to wood not understood there can be no
hostil if no resist is made but am i to leav lang nek in
natal territori in boer occup and our garrison isol and short
of provis or occupi former and reliev latter lord kimberlei
hasten to repli that the garrison must be left free to provis
themselv but we do not mean that you should march to the relief of
garrison or occupi lang nek if an arrang proce
it will be seen that the definit of what vindic of her majesti
author consist grew broader and broader it now includ the right
of the boer to continu to occupi their posit in the coloni of
natal
meanwhil the daili fire of complimentari messag wa be kept up
between presid brand and lord kimberlei who altern gave
sincer thank to lord kimberlei and fulli appreci the friendli
spirit of presid brand till on the 21st februari the latter
telegraph through collei hope of amic settlement by negoti
but thi will be greatli facilit if somebodi on spot and friendli
dispos to both could by person commun with both endeavour
to smooth difficulti offer hi servic to her majesti govern
and kruger and pretoriu and joubert ar will needless to sai hi
servic were accept
present howev on 27th februari sir georg collei made hi last
move and took possess of majuba hi defeat and death had the effect
of caus anoth temporari check in the peac negoti whilst sir
frederick robert with ampl reinforc wa despatch to natal
it had the further effect of increas the haughti of the boer
leader and infus a correspond spirit of pliabil or generos
into the negoti of her majesti govern
thu on 2d march the boer through presid brand and sir evelyn
wood inform the secretari of state for the coloni that thei ar
will to negoti but declin to submit or ceas opposit sir
evelyn wood who evid did not at all like the line of polici
adopt by the govern telegraph that he thought the best thing
to do would be for him to engag the boer and dispers them vi et
armi without ani guarante consid the disast we have
sustain and that he should if absolut necessari be empow
to promis life and properti to the leader but that thei should be
banish from the countri in answer to thi telegram lord kimberlei
inform him that her majesti govern will amnesti everybodi
except those who have commit act contrari to the rule of civilis
warfar and that thei will agre to anyth and appoint a commiss
to carri out the detail and be readi for friendli commun with
ani person appoint by the boer
thu wa her majesti author final reestablish in the
transvaal
it wa not a veri grand climax nor the kind of arrang to which
englishmen ar accustom but perhap consid the circumst
and the wellknown predilect of those who made the settlement it
wa as much as could be expect
the action of the govern must not be consid as though thei were
unfett in their judgment it can never be suppos that thei act
as thei did becaus thei thought such action right or even wise
for that would be to set them down as men of a veri low order of
intellig which thei certainli ar not
it is clear that no set of sensibl men who had after much
consider given their decis that under all the circumst
the transvaal must remain british territori and who on a revolt
subsequ break out in that territori had declar that her
majesti rule must be upheld would have put asid all
other circumst deliber stultifi themselv by almost
uncondition and of their own free will abandon the countri
and all her majesti subject live in it that would be to pai a
poor tribut to their understand sinc it is clear that if reason
exist for retain the transvaal befor the war as thei were
satisfi there did those reason would exist with still greater forc
after a war had been undertaken and three crush defeat sustain
which if left unaveng must as thei knew have a most disastr
effect on our prestig throughout the south african contin
i prefer to believ that the govern wa coerc into act as
it did by radic pressur both from outsid and from it immedi
support in the hous and that it had to choos between make an
unconvent surrend in the transvaal and lose the support of
a veri power parti under these circumst it be liber in
polit natur follow it instinct and chose surrend
if such a polici wa bad in itself and necessarili mischiev in it
consequ so much the wors for those who suffer by it it wa
clear that the govern could not be expect to lose vote in order
to forward the true interest of countri so far off as the south
african coloni which had had the misfortun to be made a parti
question of and must take the consequ
there is no doubt that the interest brought to bear on the govern
wa veri consider for not onli had thei to deal with their own
support and with the shadowi caucu that wa readi to let the lash
of it displeasur descend even on the august person of mr gladston
should he show sign of let slip so rich an opportun for the
vindic of the holiest principl of advanc radic but
also with the hydrahead crowd of visionari and profession
sentimentalist who swarm in thi countri and who ar alwai readi
to take up ani caus from that of jumbo or of a murder to that of
oppress peopl such as the bulgarian or the transvaal boer
these gentlemen burn with zeal and fill with that confid
which proverbi result from the hasti assimil of imperfect
and erron inform found in the transvaal question a great
opportun of make a nois anda in a disturb farmyard the brai
of the domest donkei ring loud and clear among the utter of
more intellig anim overwhelm and extinguish themso and
with like effect amongst the confus sound of variou english
opinion about the boer rise rose the trumpetnot of the transvaal
independ committe and it support
as we have seen thei did not sound in vain
on the 6th of march an armistic with the boer had been enter into
by sir evelyn wood which wa sever time prolong up to the 21st
march when sir evelyn wood conclud a preliminari peac with the boer
leader which under certain condit guarante the restor of
the countri within six month and left all other point to be decid
by a royal commiss
the new of thi peac wa at first receiv in the coloni in the
silenc of astonish person i rememb i would not believ
that it wa true it seem to us who had been wit of what had
pass and knew what it all meant someth so utterli incred that
we thought there must be a mistak
if there had been ani on redeem circumst about it if the
english arm had gain a singl decis victori it might have been
so but it wa hard for englishmen just at first to understand that
not onli had the transvaal been to all appear wrest from them by
forc of arm but that thei were henceforth to be subject as thei well
knew would be the case to the coars insult of victori boer and
the sarcasm of keenerwit kafir
peopl in england seem to fanci that when men go to the coloni thei
lose all sens of pride in their countri and think of noth but their
own advantag i do not think that thi is the case inde i believ
that individu for individu there exist a greater sens of
loyalti and a deeper pride in their nation and in the proud name
of england among colonist than among englishmen proper certainli
the humili of the transvaal surrend wa more keenli felt in south
africa than it wa at home but perhap the imposs of
impos upon peopl in that countri with the farrago of nonsens about
bloodguilti and nation moral which wa made such adroit us
of at home mai have made the differ
i know that person i would not have believ it possibl that i
could feel ani public event so keenli as i did thi inde i quickli
made up my mind that if the peac wa confirm the neighbourhood
of the transvaal would be no fit or comfort resid for an
englishman and that i would at ani cost leav the countrywhich i
accordingli did
newcastl wa a curiou sight the night after the peac wa declar
everi hotel and bar wa crowd with refuge who were try to
reliev their feel by curs the name of gladston with a vigour
origin and earnest that i have never heard equal and
declar in iron term how proud thei were to be citizen of
englanda countri that alwai kept it word then thei set to work
with mani demonstr of contempt to burn the effigi of the right
honour gentleman at the head of her majesti govern an
exampl by the wai that wa follow throughout south africa
even sir evelyn wood who is veri popular in the coloni wa hiss
as he walk through the town and great surpris wa express that
a soldier who came out expressli to fight the boer should consent
to becom the medium of commun in such a dirti busi and
inde there wa some excus for all thi bitter for the new
meant ruin to veri mani
but if peopl in natal and at the cape receiv the new with
astonish how shall i describ it effect upon the unfortun loyal
inhabit in the transvaal on whom it burst like a thunderbolt
thei did not sai much howev and inde there wa noth to be said
thei simpli began to pack up such thing as thei could carri with them
and to leav the countri which thei well knew would henceforth be
utterli unten for englishmen or english sympathis in a few week
thei came pour down through newcastl by hundr it wa the
most melancholi exodu that can be imagin there were peopl of all
class offici gentlefolk workpeopl and loyal boer but
thei had a connect link thei had all been loyal and thei were all
ruin
most of these peopl had gone to the transvaal sinc it becam a british
coloni and invest all thei had in it and now their capit wa lost
and their labour render abort inde mani of them whom on had
known as well to do in the transvaal came down to natal hardli know
how thei would feed their famili next week
it must be understood that so soon as the queen sovereignti wa
withdrawn the valu of land and hous properti in the transvaal went
down to noth and ha remain there ever sinc thu a fairsiz
hous in pretoria brought in a rental vari from ten to twenti pound
a month dure british occup but after the declar of peac
owner of hous were glad to get peopl to live in them to keep them
from fall into ruin those who own land or had invest monei in
busi suffer in the same wai their properti remain neither
profit or saleabl and thei themselv ar preclud by their
nation from live on it the art of boycot not be
peculiar to ireland
nor were thei the onli suffer the offici mani of whom had taken
to the govern servic as a perman profess in which thei
expect to pass their live were suddenli dismiss mostli with a
small gratuiti which would about suffic to pai their debt and told
to find their live as best thei could it wa inde a case of vae
victiswo to the conquer loyalist
the follow extract is clip from a recent issu of
the transvaal advertis it describ the present
condit of pretoria
the street grown over with rank veget the water
furrow unclean and unattend emit offens and

the commiss appoint by her majesti govern consist of sir
hercul robinson sir henri de villier and sir evelyn wood presid
brand be also present in hi capac of friend of both parti
and to their discret were left the settlement of all outstand
question amongst these were the mode of trial of those person who
had been guilti of act contrari to the rule of civilis warfar the
question of sever of territori from the transvaal on the eastern
boundari the settlement of the boundari in the keateaward district
the compens for loss sustain dure the war the function of
the british resid and other matter their place of meet wa at
newcastl in natal and from thenc thei proceed to pretoria
the first question of import that came befor the commiss wa
the mode of trial to be adopt in the case of those person accus
of act contrari to the usag of civilis warfar such as murder
the attorneygener for the transvaal strongli advis that a special
tribun should be constitut to try these case princip becaus
after a civil war in which all the inhabit of a countri with veri
few except have taken part a juri of fair and imparti men truli
unbiass will be veri difficult to get togeth it is satisfactori
to know that the commission gave thi somewhat obviou fact their
grave consider which accord to their report result in
their determin to let the case go befor the ordinari court and be
tri by a juri becaus in refer them to a special constitut
court which would have done equal justic without fear or favour
the british govern would have made for itself among the dutch
popul of south africa a name for vindict oppress which no
generos in other affair could effac
there is more in thi determin of the commission or rather of
the major of themfor sir e wood to hi credit be it said refus
to agre in their decisionthan meet the ey the fact of the matter
be that it wa privat well known to them that though the boer
leader might be will to allow a few of the murder to undergo the
form of a trial neither thei nor the boer themselv meant to
permit the farc to go ani further had the men been tri by a special
tribun thei would in all probabl have been condemn to death and
then would have come the awkward question of carri out the sentenc
on individu whose deed were look on if not with gener approv
at ani rate without avers by the great mass of their countrymen in
short it would probabl have becom necessari either to repriev them
or to fight the boer again sinc it wa veri certain that thei
would not have allow them to be hung therefor the major of
the commission find themselv face to face with a dead wall
determin to slip round it instead of boldli climb it by refer
the case to the transvaal high court cheerfulli confid of what the
result must be
after all the matter wa much cry about littl wool for of all the
crime commit by the boersa list of some of which will be found in
the appendix to thi bookin onli three case were a proport of the
perpetr produc and put through the form of trial those three
were the dastardli murder of captain elliot who wa shot by hi boer
escort while cross the vaal river on parol the murder of a man
name malcolm who wa kick to death in hi own hous by boer who
afterward put a bullet through hi head to make the job look better
and the murder of a doctor name barber who wa shot by hi escort on
the border of the free state a few of the men concern in the first
two of these crime were tri in pretoria and it wa current
report at that time that in order to make their acquitt certain
our attorneygener receiv instruct not to exercis hi right of
challeng juror on behalf of the crown whether or not thi is true
i am not prepar to sai but i believ it is a fact that he did
not exercis that right though the counsel of the prison avail
themselv of it freeli with the result that in elliot case the juri
wa compos of eight boer and on german nine be the full south
african juri the necessari result follow in both case the prison
were acquit in the teeth of the evid barber murder were
tri in the free state and were as might be expect acquit
thu it will be seen that of all the perpetr of murder and other
crime dure the cours of the war not on wa brought to justic
the offenc for which their victim di wa in nearli everi case that
thei had serv were serv or were loyal to her majesti the queen
in no singl case ha england exact retribut for the murder of
her servant and citizen but nobodi can read through the long list
of these dastardli slaughter without feel that thei will not go
unaveng the innoc blood that ha been shed on behalf of thi
countri and the tear of children and widow now appeal to a higher
tribun than that of mr gladston govern and assuredli thei
will not appeal in vain
the next point of import dealt with by the commiss wa the
question whether or no ani territori should be sever from the
transvaal and kept under english rule for the benefit of the nativ
inhabit lord kimberlei act under pressur put upon him by
member of the aborigin protect societi instruct the commiss
to consid the advis of sever the district of lydenburg and
zoutpansberg and also a strip of territori border on zululand and
swazieland from the transvaal so as to place the inhabit of the
first two district out of danger of maltreat by the boer and to
interpos a buffer between zulu and swazi and boer aggress and
vice versa
the boer leader had it must be rememb acquiesc in the principl
of such a separ in the preliminari peac sign by sir evelyn wood
and themselv the major of the commiss howev sir evelyn wood
dissent final decid against the retent of either of these
district a decis which i think wa a wise on though i arriv
at that conclus on veri differ ground to those adopt by the
major of the commiss
person i cannot see that it is the duti of england to plai
policeman to the whole world to have retain these nativ district
would have been to make ourselv respons for their good govern
and to have guarante them against boer encroach which i do not
think that we were call upon to do it is sure not incumb
upon us have given up the transvaal to the boer to undertak the
manag of the most troublesom part of it the zulu border besid
bad as the abandon of the transvaal is i think that if it wa to
be done at all it wa best to do it thoroughli sinc to have kept some
nativ under our protect and to have hand over the rest to the
tender merci of the boer would onli be to render our injustic more
obviou whilst weaken the power of the nativ themselv to combin
in selfdef sinc those under our protect would natur have
littl sympathi with their more unfortun brethrentheir interest
and circumst be differ
the commiss do not seem to have consid the question from these
point of view but put them on on side there ar mani other
consider connect with it which ar abli sum up in their
report amongst these is the danger of disturb commenc between
zulu or swazi and boer spread into natal and the probabl
of the foment of disturb amongst the zulu by boer the great
argument for the retent of some territori if onli as a symbol that
the english had not been driven out of the countri is howev
set forth in the fortysixth paragraph of the report which run as
followsth moral consider that determin the action of
civilis govern ar not easili understood by barbarian in whose
ey success forc is alon the sign of superior and it
appear possibl that the surrend by the british crown of on of it
possess to those who had been in arm against it might be look
upon by the nativ in no other wai than as a token of the defeat and
decai of the british power and that thu a seriou shock might be given
to british author in south africa and the capac of great britain
to govern and direct the vast nativ popul within and without her
south african dominionsa capac rest larg on the renown of her
namemight be danger impair
these word come from so unexpect a sourc do not though couch
in such mild languag hide the startl import of the question
discuss on the contrari thei accur and with doubl weight
convei the sens and gist of the most damn argument against the
polici of the retrocess of the transvaal in it entireti and
proceed from their own carefulli chosen commission can hardli
have been pleasant read to lord kimberlei and hi colleagu
the major of the commiss then proce to set forth the argument
advanc by the boer against the retent of ani territori which
appear to have been chiefli of a sentiment charact sinc we ar
inform that the peopl it seem certain would not have valu the
restor of a mutil countri sentiment in a great measur had
led them to insurrect and the forc of such it wa imposs to
disregard sir e wood in hi dissent state that he cannot even
agre with the premis of hi colleagu argument sinc he is
convinc that it wa not sentiment that had led to the outbreak but a
gener and root avers to taxat if he had ad and a hatr
not onli of english rule but of all rule he would have state the
complet caus of the transvaal rebellion in the next paragraph of
the report howev we find the real caus of the pliabil of the
commiss in the matter which is the same that influenc them in
their decis about the mode of trial of the murder and other
questionsthei fear that the peopl would appeal to arm if thei
decid against their wish
discredit and disgrac as it mai seem nobodi can read thi
report without plainli see that the commission were in treat
with the boer on these point in the posit of ambassador from a
beaten peopl get the best term thei could of cours thei well
knew that thi wa not the case but whatev the boer leader mai have
said the boer themselv did not know thi or even pretend to look at
the matter in ani other light when we ask for the countri back said
thei we did not get it after we had three time defeat the english
we did get it the logic conclus from the fact be that we got
it becaus we defeat the english thi wa their tone and it is not
therefor surpris that whenev the commiss threaten to decid
anyth against them thei with a smile let it know that if it did
thei would be under the pain necess of reoccupi lang nek
it wa never necessari to repeat the threat sinc the major of the
commiss would thereupon speedili find a wai to meet the view of the
boer repres
sir evelyn wood in hi dissent thu correctli sum up the matterto
contend that the royal commiss ought not to decid contrari to the
wish of the boer becaus such decis might not be accept is
to deni to the commiss the veri power of decis that it wa agre
should be left in it hand exactli so but it is evid that the
commiss knew it place and so far from attempt to exercis ani
power of decis it wa quit content with such concess as
it could obtain by mean of bargain thu as an addit reason
against the retent of ani territori it is urg that if thi
territori wa retain the major of your commission would
have found themselv in no favour posit for obtain the
concurr of the boer leader as to other matter in fact her
majesti commiss appoint or suppos to be appoint to do
her majesti will and pleasur shook in it shoe befor men who had
late been rebel in arm against her author and humbl submit
itself to their dicta
the major of the commiss went on to express their opinion that
by give awai about the retent of territori thei would be abl to
obtain better term for the nativ gener and larger power for the
british resid but as sir evelyn wood point out in hi report thei
did noth of the sort the term of the agreement about the resid
and other nativ matter be all consequ on and includ in the
first agreement of peac besid thei seem to have overlook the
fact that such concess as thei did obtain ar onli on paper and
practic worthless whilst all bona fide advantag remain with
the boer
the decis of the commission in the question of the keat award
which next came under their consider appear to have been a
judici on be found on the veri care report of colonel
moysei re who had been for mani month collect inform on the
spot the keat award territori is a region ly to the southwest
of the transvaal and wa like mani other district in that countri
origin in the possess of nativ of the baralong and batlapin
tribe individu boer have howev more suo taken possess
of tract of land in the district difficulti speedili aros
between their govern and the nativ chief and in 1871 mr keat
lieutenantgovernor of natal wa by mutual consent call in to
arbitr on the matter hi decis wa entir in favour of the
nativ and wa accordingli promptli and characterist repudi
by the boer volksraad from that time till the rebellion the question
remain unsettl and wa inde a veri thorni on to deal with the
commiss act on the principl in medio tutissimu ibi drew a
line through the midst of the disput territori or in other word
set asid mr keat award and interpret the disput in favour of the
boer
thi decis wa accept by all parti at the time but it ha not
result in the mainten of peac the princip chief montsoia is
an old alli and staunch friend of the english a fact which the boer
were not abl to forget or forgiv and thei appear to have stir
up rival chief to attack him and to have allow volunt from
the transvaal to assist them montsoia ha also enlist some white
volunt and sever fight have taken place in which the loss of
life ha been consider whether or no the transvaal govern
is directli concern it is imposs to sai but from the fact that
cannon ar said to have been us against montsoia it would appear
that it is sinc privat individu do not as a rule own armstrong
gun
i beg to refer ani reader interest in thi matter to
the letter of transvaal to the standard which i have
republish in the appendix to thi book
amongst the question remain for the consider of the
commission wa that of what compens should be given for loss
dure the war of cours the great bulk of the loss sustain
were of an indirect natur result from the necessari and enorm
depreci in the valu of land and other properti consequ on the
retrocess into thi matter the home govern declin to enter
therebi save it pocket at the price of it honour sinc it wa upon
english guarante that the countri would remain a british possess
that the major of the unfortun loyal invest their monei in
it it wa howev agre by the commiss sir h de villier
dissent that the boer should be liabl for compens in
case where loss had been sustain through command seizur
confisc destruct or damag of properti the sum award under
these head have alreadi amount to about 110000 pound which sum ha
been defrai by the imperi govern the boer author state
that thei were not in a posit to pai it
in connect with thi matter i will pass to the financi claus of
the report when the countri wa annex the public debt amount
to 301727 pound under british rule thi debt wa liquid to
the extent of 150000 pound but the total wa brought up by a
parliamentari grant a loan from the standard bank and sundri to
390404 pound which repres the public debt of the transvaal on
the 31st decemb 1880 thi wa further increas by monei advanc by
the standard bank and english exchequ dure the war and till the
8th august 1881 dure which time the countri yield no revenu to
457393 pound to thi must be ad an estim sum of 200000 pound
for compens charg pension allow c and a further sum of
383000 pound the cost of the success expedit against secocoeni
that of the unsuccess on be left out of account bring up the
total public debt to over a million of which about 800000 pound is
ow to thi countri
thi sum with the characterist liber that distinguish them in
their deal with the boer but which wa not so mark where loyal
were concern the commission sir evelyn wood dissent reduc
by a stroke of the pen to 265000 pound thu entir remit an
approxim sum of 500000 pound or 600000 pound to the sum of
265000 pound still ow must be ad sai anoth 150000 pound
for sum late advanc to pai the compens claim bring up the
actual amount now ow to england to someth under half a million of
which i sai with confid she will never see a singl 10000 pound
as thi conting wa not contempl or if contempl not
allud to by the royal commiss provis wa made for a sink
fund by mean of which the debt which is a second charg on the
revenu of the state is to be extinguish in twentyf year
it is a strang instanc of the proverbi ironi of fate that whilst
the repres of the imperi govern were thu shower gift
of hundr of thousand of pound upon men who had spurn the benefit
of her majesti rule made war upon her forc and murder her
subject no such consider wa extend to those who had remain
loyal to her throne their claim for compens were pass by
unheed and look from the window of the room in which thei sat in
newcastl the member of the commiss might have seen them flock
down from a countri that could no longer be their home those that
were rich among them made poor and those that were poor reduc to
destitut
the onli other point which it will be necessari for me to touch on in
connect with thi report is the duti of the british resid and
hi relat to the nativ he wa to be invest as repres of
the suzerain with function for secur the execut of the term
of peac as regard 1 the control of the foreign relat of the
state 2 the control of the frontier affair of the state and 3
the protect of the interest of the nativ in the state
as regard the first of these point it wa arrang that the interest
of subject of the transvaal should be left in the hand of her
majesti repres abroad sinc boer ar of all peopl in the
world the most stayathom our ambassador and consul ar not like
to be troubl much on their account with refer to the second
point the commiss made stipul that would be admir if there
were ani probabl of their be act up to the resid is
to report ani encroach on nativ territori by boer to the high
commission and when the resid and the boer govern differ
the decis of the suzerain is to be final thi is a charm wai of
settl difficulti but the commiss forget to specifi how the
suzerain decis is to be enforc after what ha happen it can
hardli have reli on aw of the name of england to bring about the
desir obedi
but besid thu us hi benefic author to prevent subject of
the transvaal from trespass on their neighbour land the resid
is to exercis a gener supervis over the interest of all the
nativ in the countri consid that thei number about a million
and ar scatter over a territori larger than franc on would think
that thi duti alon would have taken up the time of ani ordinari
man and inde sir evelyn wood wa in favour of the appoint of
subresid to assist him the major of the commiss refus
howev to listen to ani such suggestionbeliev thei said that
the least possibl interfer with the independ govern of the
state would be the wisest quit so but i suppos it never occur
to them to ask the nativ what their view of the matter were the
resid wa also to be a member of a nativ locat committe which
wa at some futur time to provid land for nativ to live on
in perus thi report it is easi to follow with more or less accuraci
the individu bent of it framer sir hercul robinson figur
throughout as a man who ha got a disagre busi to carri out
in obedi to instruct that admit of no trifl with and who ha
set himself to do the best he can for hi countri and those who suffer
through hi countri polici whilst obei those instruct he ha
evid choke down hi feel and opinion as an individu and
turn himself into an offici machin mere regist in detail
the will of lord kimberlei with sir henri de villier the case is veri
differ on feel throughout that the task is to him a congeni on
and that the boer caus ha in him an excel friend inde had he
been an advoc of their caus instead of a member of the commiss
he could not have espous their side on everi occas with greater
zeal accord to him thei were alwai in the right and in them he
could find no guil mr hofmey and presid brand exercis a wise
discret from their own point of view when thei urg hi appoint
as special commission i now come to sir evelyn wood who wa in the
posit of an independ englishman neither prejud in favour
of the boer or the revers and on whom as a militari man lord
kimberlei would find it difficult to put the offici screw the result
of hi happi posit ar obviou in the paper attach to the end of
the report and sign by him in which he total and entir differ
from the major of the commiss on everi point of import most
peopl will think that thi veri outspok and forcibl dissent deduct
somewhat from the valu of the report and throw a shadow of doubt on
the wisdom of it provis
the formal document of agreement between her majesti govern and
the boer leader commonli known as the convent wa sign by both
parti at pretoria on the afternoon of the 3d august 1881 in the same
room in which nearli four year befor the annex proclam wa
sign by sir t shepston
whilst thi busi wa be transact in govern hous a curiou
ceremoni wa go on just outsid and within sight of the window
thi wa the ceremoni burial of the union jack which wa follow to
the grave by a crowd of about 2000 loyalist and nativ chief on the
outsid of the coffin wa written the word resurgam and an eloqu
orat wa deliv over the grave such demonstr ar no
doubt foolish enough but thei ar not entir without polit
signific
but a more unpleas duti await the commission than that of
attach their signatur to a documentconsist of the necess
of convei her majesti decis as to the retrocess to about a
hundr nativ chief until now her majesti subject who had been
gather togeth to hear it it must be born in mind that the nativ
had not been consult as to the dispos of the countri although thei
outnumb the white peopl in the proport of twenti to on and that
beyond some worthless paper stipul noth had been done for
their interest
person i must plead guilti to what i know is by mani especi
by those who ar attach to the boer caus consid as folli if not
wors name a suffici interest in the nativ and sympathi with
their suffer to bring me to the conclus that in act thu we
have inflict a cruel injustic upon them it seem to me that as
thei were the origin owner of the soil thei were entitl to some
consider in the question of it dispos and consequ and
incident of their own i am awar that it is gener consid
that the white man ha a right to the black man possess and land
and that it is hi high and holi mission to extermin the wretch
nativ and take hi place but with thi conclus i ventur to differ
so far as my own experi of nativ ha gone i have found that in
all the essenti qualiti of mind and bodi thei veri much resembl
white men with the except that thei ar as a race quickerwit
more honest and braver than the ordinari run of white men of them
might be aptli quot the speech shakespear put into shylock mouth
hath not a jew ey hath not a jew hand organ dimens sens
affect passion in the same wai i ask ha a nativ no feel
or affect doe he not suffer when hi parent ar shot or hi
children stolen or when he is driven a wander from hi home doe he
not know fear feel pain affect hate and gratitud most certainli
he doe and thi be so i cannot believ that the almighti who
made both white and black gave to the on race the right or mission of
extermin or even of rob or maltreat the other and call
the process the advanc of civilis it seem to me that on onli
on condit if at all have we the right to take the black man
land and that is that we provid them with an equal and a just
govern and allow no maltreat of them either as individu or
tribe but on the contrari do our best to elev them and wean them
from savag custom otherwis the practic is sure undefens
i am awar howev that with the except of a small class these
ar sentiment which ar not share by the great major of the public
either at home or abroad inde it can be plainli seen how littl
sympathi thei command from the fact that but scanti remonstr
wa rais at the treatment mete out to our nativ subject in the
transvaal when thei were to the number of nearli a million
hand over from the peac justic and secur that on the whole
characteris our rule to a state of thing and possibl of wrong
and suffer which i will not try to describ
to the chief thu assembl sir hercul robinson as presid of the
royal commiss read a statement and then retir refus to allow
them to speak in answer the statement inform the nativ that her
majesti govern with that sens of justic which befit a great
and power nation had return the countri to the boer whose
repres messr kruger pretoriu and joubert i now said
sir hercul have much pleasur in introduc to you if report ar
true the nativ chief had mani of them person and all of them by
reput alreadi the advantag of a veri intim acquaint with
all three of these gentlemen so that an introduct wa somewhat
superflu
sir hercul went on to explain to them that locat would be allot
to them at some futur time that a british resid would be appoint
whose especi charg thei would be but that thei must bear in mind
that he wa not the ruler of the countri but the govern subject
to her majesti suzerain right nativ were no doubt expect to
know by intuit what suzerain right ar the statement then goe on
to give them good advic as to the advantag of indulg in manual
labour when ask to do so by the boer and gener to show them how
bright and happi is the futur that li befor them lest thei should
be too elat by such good tide thei ar howev remind that it
will be necessari to retain the law relat to pass which is in
the hand of a peopl like the boer about as unjust a regul as
a domin race can invent for the oppress of a subject peopl and
had in the old dai of the republ been product of much hardship
the statement wind up by assur them that their interest will never
be forgotten or neglect by her majesti govern have read the
document the commiss hastili withdrew and after their withdraw
the chief were allow to state their opinion to the secretari for
nativ affair
in avail themselv of thi permiss it is notic that no
allus wa made to all the advantag thei were to reap under
the convent nor did thei seem to attach much import to the
appoint of the british resid on the contrari all their
attent wa given to the great fact that the countri had been cede
to the boer and that thei were no longer the queen subject we
ar told in mr shepston report that thei got veri excit and
ask whether it wa thought that thei had no feel or heart that
thei were thu treat as a stick or piec of tobacco which could be
pass from hand to hand without question umgombari a zoutpansberg
chief said i am umgombari i have fought with the boer and have
mani wound and thei know that what i sai is true i will never
consent to place myself under their rule i belong to the english
govern i am not a man who eat with both side of hi jaw at onc
i onli us on side i am english i have said silamba said i belong
to the english i will never return under the boer you see me a man
of my rank and posit is it right that such as i should be seiz
and laid on the ground and flog as ha been done to me and other
chief
sinkanhla said we hear and yet do not hear we cannot understand we
ar troubl you chief by talk in thi wai we hear the chief sai
that the queen took the countri becaus the peopl of the countri wish
it and again that the major of the owner of the countri did not
wish their rule and that therefor the countri wa given back we
should like to have the man point out from among us black peopl who
object to the rule of the queen we ar the real owner of the countri
we were here when the boer came and without ask leav settl down
and treat us in everi wai badli the english govern then came and
took the countri we have now had four year of rest and peac
and just rule we have been call here todai and ar told that the
countri our countri ha been given to the boer by the queen thi is
a thing which surpris us did the countri then belong to the boer
did it not belong to our father and forefath befor us long befor
the boer came here we have heard that the boer countri is at the
cape if the queen wish to give them their land why doe she not give
them back the cape
i have quot thi speech at length becaus although made by a
despis nativ it set forth their case more powerfulli and in happier
languag than i can do
umyethil said we have no heart for talk i have return to the
countri from sech where i had to fly from boer oppress our
heart ar black and heavi with grief todai at the new told us we ar
in agoni our intestin ar twist and writh insid of us just as
you see a snake do when it is struck on the head we do not know
what ha becom of us but we feel dead it mai be that the lord mai
chang the natur of the boer and that we will not be treat like
dog and beast of burden as formerli but we have no hope of such a
chang and we leav you with heavi heart and great apprehens as
to the futur in hi report mr shepston the secretari for nativ
affair sai on chief jan sibilo who ha been he inform me
person threaten with death by the boer after the english leav
could not restrain hi feel but cri like a child
i have noth to add to these extract which ar taken from mani such
statement thei ar the veri word of the person most concern and
will speak for themselv
the convent wa sign on the 3d august 1881 and wa to be formal
ratifi by a volksraad or parliament of the burgher within three
month of that date in default of which it wa to fall to the ground
and becom null and void
anybodi who ha follow the cours of affair with refer to the
retrocess of the transvaal or who ha even taken the troubl to read
through thi brief histori will probabl come to the conclus that
under all the circumst the boer had got more than thei could
reason expect not so howev the boer themselv on the 28th
septemb the newlyelect volksraad refer the convent to a
gener committe to report on and on the 30th septemb the report
wa present on the 3d octob a telegram wa despatch through
the british resid to hi excel w e gladston in which the
volksraad state that the convent is not accept
1 becaus it is in conflict with the sand river treati of 1852
2 becaus it violat the peac agreement enter into with sir
evelyn wood in confid of which the boer laid down their arm
the volksraad consequ declar that modif were desir
and that certain articl must be alter
to begin with thei declar that the conduct of foreign relat doe
not appertain to the suzerain onli supervis and that the articl
bear on these point must consequ be modifi thei next attack
the nativ question state that the suzerain ha not the right to
interfer with our legislatur and state that thei cannot agre to
articl 3 which give the suzerain a right of veto on legisl
connect with the nativ to articl 13 by virtu of which nativ
ar to be allow to acquir land and to the last part of articl
26 by which it is provid that white of alien race live in the
transvaal shall not be tax in excess of the tax impos on transvaal
citizen
thei further declar that it is infra dignitatem for the presid of
the transvaal to be a member of a commiss thi refer to the nativ
locat commiss on which he is in the term of the convent
to sit togeth with the british resid and a third person jointli
appoint
thei next declar that the amount of the debt for which the commiss
ha made them liabl should be modifi consid that england had
alreadi made them a present of from 600000 pound to 800000 pound
thi is a most barefac demand final thei state that articl 15
16 26 and 27 ar superflu and onli calcul to wound our sens
of honour sic
articl 15 enact that no slaveri or apprenticeship shall be toler
articl 16 provid for religi toler
articl 26 provid for the free movement trade and resid of all
person other than nativ conform themselv to the law of the
transvaal
articl 27 give to all the right of free access to the court of
justic
put the sens of honour of the transvaal volksraad out of the
question past experi ha but too plainli prove that these articl
ar by no mean superflu
in repli to thi messag sir hercul robinson telegraph to the
british resid on the 21st octob in the follow word
have forward volksraad resolut of 15th to earl of kimberlei i
am desir to instruct you in repli to repeat to the triumvir
that her majesti govern cannot entertain ani propos for a
modif of the convent until after it ha been ratifi and
the necess for further concess prove by experi
i wish to draw particular attent to the last part of thi messag
which is extrem typic of the line of polici adopt throughout
in the transvaal busi the english govern dare not make ani
further concess to the boer becaus thei felt that thei had alreadi
strain the temper of the countri almost to break in the matter on
the other hand thei were afraid that if thei did not do someth the
boer would tear up the convent and thei would find themselv face
to face with the old difficulti under these circumst thei have
fallen back upon their temporis and unenglish polici which leav
them a backdoor to escap through whatev turn thing take should
the boer now suddenli turn round and declar which is extrem
probabl that thei repudi their debt to us or that thei ar sick
of the presenc of a british resid the govern will be abl
to announc that the necess for further concess ha now been
prove by experi and thu escap the difficulti in short thi
telegram ha depriv the convent of whatev final it mai have
possess and made it as a document as worthless as it is as a
practic settlement that thi is the view taken of it by the boer
themselv is prove by the text of the ratif which follow on
the receipt of thi telegram
the tone of thi document throughout is in my opinion consid from
whom it came and against whom it is direct veri insol and it
ampli confirm what i have previous said that the boer look upon
themselv as a victori peopl make term with those thei have
conquer the ratif lead off thu the volksraad is not
satisfi with thi convent and consid that the member of the
triumvir perform a fervent act of love for the fatherland when
thei upon their own respons sign such an unsatisfactori state
document thi is damn with faint prais inde it then goe on to
recit the variou point of object state that the answer from the
english govern prove that thei were well found the english
govern it sai acknowledg indirectli by thi answer the
telegram of 21st octob quot abov that the difficulti rais
by the volksraad ar neither fictiti nor unfound inasmuch as it
desir from us the concess that we the volksraad shall submit
it to a practic test it will be observ that english is here
repres as beg the favour of a trial of her condit from the
volksraad of the transvaal boer the ratif is in these word
therefor it is that the raad here unanim resolv not to go into
further discuss of the convent and maintain all object
to the convent as made befor the royal commiss or state in the
raad and for the purpos of show to everybodi that the love of peac
and uniti inspir us for the time and provision submit the
articl of the convent to a practic test herebi compli with
the request of the english govern contain in the telegram of the
13th octob 1881 proce to ratifi the convent
it would have been interest to have seen how such a ratif as
thi which is no ratif but an insult would have been accept
by lord beaconsfield i think that within twentyfour hour of it
arriv in down street the boer volksraad would have receiv a
startl answer but lord beaconsfield is dead and by hi successor it
wa receiv with all due thank and humil hi word howev
on thi subject still remain to us and even hi great rival might
have done well to listen to them it wa in the cours of what wa i
believ the last speech he made in the hous of lord that speak
about the transvaal rise he warn the govern that it wa a veri
danger thing to make peac with rebelli subject in arm against
the author of the queen the warn pass unheed and the peac
wa made in the wai i have describ
as regard the convent itself it will be obviou to the reader that
the boer have not ani intent of act up to it provis mild
as thei ar if thei can possibl avoid them whilst on the other hand
there is no forc at hand to punish their disregard or breach it is all
veri well to creat a resid with extens power but how is he to
enforc hi decis what is he to do if hi award ar laugh at and
made a mockeri of as thei ar and will be the posit of mr hudson
at pretoria is even wors than that of mr osborn in zululand for
instanc the convent specifi in the first articl that the
transvaal is to be known as the transvaal state the boer govern
have howev thought fit to adopt the name of south african republ
in all public document mr hudson wa accordingli direct to
remonstr which he did in a feebl wai hi remonstr wa polit
acknowledg but the countri is still offici call the south
african republ the convent and mr hudson remonstr
notwithstand mr hudson howev appear to be better suit to
the posit than would have been the case had an englishman pure and
simpl been appoint sinc it is evid that thing that would
have struck the latter as insult to the queen he repres and hi
countri gener ar not so understood by him in fact he admir
repres hi offici superior in hi capac of swallow rebuff
and when smitten on on cheek delightedli offer the other
thu we find him attend a boer meet of thanksgiv for the
success that had wait on their arm and the recognit of their
independ where most peopl will consid he wa out of place to
thi meet thu grace by hi presenc an address wa present by
a branch of the africand bond a power institut have for it
object the total uproot of english rule and english custom in south
africa to which he must have listen with pleasur in it he in
common with other member of the meet is inform that you took
up the sword and struck the briton with such forc that the briton
through fear reviv that sens of justic to which thei could not be
brought by petit and that the dai will soon come that we shall
enter with you on on arena for the entir independ of south
africa ie independ from english rule
on the follow dai the govern gave a dinner to which all those
who had done good servic dure the late hostil were invit the
british resid be appar the onli englishman ask amongst the
other celebr present i notic the name of busk thi man who
is an educ holland wa the move spirit of the potchefstroom
atroc inde so dark is hi reput that the royal commiss
refus to transact busi with him or to admit him into their
presenc mr hudson wa not so particular and now come the most
extraordinari part of the episod at the dinner it wa necessari that
the health of her majesti as suzerain should be propos and with
studi insol thi wa done last of all the lead polit
toast and immedi after that of the triumvir notwithstand
thi fact and that the toast wa couch by mr joubert who state
that he would not attempt to explain what a suzerain wa in what
appear to be semiiron term we find that mr hudson beg to
tender hi thank to the honour mr joubert for the kind wai in
which he propos the toast
it mai pleas mr hudson to see the name of the queen thu
metaphor drag in triumph at the chariot wheel of the
triumvir but it is satisfactori to know that the spectacl is not
appreci in england sinc on a question in the hous of lord by
the earl of carnarvon who characteris it as a deliber insult lord
kimberlei repli that the british resid had been instruct that
in futur he wa not to attend public demonstr unless he had
previous inform himself that the name of her majesti would be
treat with proper respect let us hope that thi offici reprimand
will have it effect and that mr hudson will learn therefrom that
there is such a thing as trop de zeleeven in a good caus
the convent is now a thing of the past the appropri reward have
been lavishli distribut to it framer and presid brand ha at
last prevail upon the volksraad of the orang free state to allow him
to becom a knight grand cross of saint michael and saint georgeth
same prize look forward to by our most distinguish public servant
at the close of the devot of their life to the servic of their
countri but it result ar yet to comethough it would be difficult
to forecast the detail of their develop on thing howev is
clear the sign of that document signalis an entir new departur
in south african affair and brought us within a measur distanc
of the abandon for the present at ani rate of the supremaci of
english rule in south africa
thi is the larger issu of the matter and it is alreadi bear fruit
embolden by their success in the transvaal the dutch parti at the
cape ar demand and the demand is to be grant that the dutch
tongu be admit pari passu with english as the offici languag
in the law court and the hous of assembl when a countri thu
consent to us a foreign tongu equal with it own it is a sure
sign that those who speak it ar rise to power but the parti
look higher than thi and openli aim at throw off english rule
altogeth and declar south africa a great dutch republ the
cours of event is favour to their aspir respons
govern is to be grant to natal which countri not be strong
enough to stand alon in the face of the mani danger that surround her
will be driven into the arm of the dutch parti to save herself from
destruct it will be useless for her to look for help from england
and ani feel of repugn she mai feel to boer rule will soon be
choke by necess and a mutual interest it is howev possibl
that some unforeseen event such as the advent to power of a strong
conserv ministri mai check the tide that now set so strongli in
favour of dutch supremaci
it seem to me howev to be a question worthi of the consider
of those who at present direct the destini of the empir whether it
would not be wise as thei have gone so far to go a littl further and
favour a scheme for the total abandon of south africa retain
onli tabl bai if thei do not it is now quit within the bound of
sober possibl that thei mai on dai have to face a fresh transvaal
rebellion onli on a ten time larger scale and might find it difficult
to retain even tabl bai if on the other hand thei do i believ
that all the white state in south africa will confeder of their own
freewil under the pressur of the necess for common action and
the dutch element be preponder at onc set to work to extermin
the nativ on gener principl in much the same wai and from much
the same motiv that a cook extermin black beetl becaus she
think them ugli and to clear the kitchen
i need hardli sai that such a polici is not on that command my
sympathi but her majesti govern have put their hand to the
plough it is worth their while to consid it it would at ani rate
be in perfect accord with their declar sentiment and command an
enthusiast support from their follow
as regard the smaller and more immedi issu of the retrocess
name it effect on the transvaal itself it cannot be other than
evil the act is i believ quit without preced in our histori
and it is difficult to see look at it from those high ground of
nation moral assum by the govern what greater argument
can be advanc in it favour than could be found to support the
abandon oflet us sayireland inde a certain parallel
undoubtedli exist between the circumst of the two countri
ireland wa like the transvaal annex though a long time ago and
ha continu agit for it freedom the irish hate us so did the
boer in ireland englishmen ar be shot and england is run the
aw risk of bloodguilti as it did in the transvaal in ireland
smoulder revolut is be fan into flame by mr gladston
speech and act as it wa in the transvaal in ireland as in the
transvaal there exist a strong loyal class that receiv insult
instead of support from the govern and whose properti as wa the
case there is taken from them without compens to be flung as a
sop to stop the mouth of the queen enemi and so i might go on
find mani such similar of circumst but my parallel like
most parallel must break down at last thusit matter littl to
england whether or no she let the transvaal go but to let ireland go
would be more than even mr gladston dare attempt
somehow if you follow these thing far enough you alwai come
to vulgar first principl the differ between the case of the
transvaal and that of ireland is a differ not of justic but of
caus for both caus ar equal unjust or just accord as thei
ar view but of mere common expedi judg from the elev
standpoint of the nation moral theori howev which as we know
soar abov such truism as the foolish statement that forc is a
remedi or that if you wish to retain your prestig you must not allow
defeat to pass unaveng i cannot see why if it wa righteou to
abandon the transvaal it would not be equal righteou to abandon
ireland
as for the transvaal that countri is not to be congratul on it
success for it ha destroi all it hope of perman peac ha
ruin it trade and credit and ha driven awai the most us and
product class in the commun the boer elat by their success in
arm will be littl like to settl down to peaceabl occup
and still less like to pai their tax which inde i hear thei
ar alreadi refus to do thei have learnt how easili even a power
govern can be upset and the lesson is not like to be forgotten
for want of repetit to their own weak on
alreadi the transvaal govern hardli know which wai to turn for
fund and is perhap fortun for itself quit unabl to borrow
through want of credit
as regard the nativ question i agre with mr h shepston who
in hi report on thi subject sai that he doe not believ that the
nativ will inaugur ani action against the boer so long as the
latter do not try to collect tax or otherwis interfer with them
but if the boer govern is to continu to exist it will be bound
to rais tax from the nativ sinc it cannot collect much from it
white subject the first gener attempt of the sort will be the signal
for activ resist on the part of the nativ whom if thei act
without concert the boer will be abl to crush in detail though with
consider loss if on the other hand thei should have happen
dure the last few year to have learnt the advantag of combin
as is quit possibl perhap thei will crush the boer
the onli thing that is at present certain about the matter is that there
will be bloodsh and that befor long for instanc the montsoia
difficulti in the keat award ha in it the possibl of a seriou
war and there ar plenti such difficulti readi to spring into life
within and without the transvaal
in all human probabl it will take but a small laps of time for
the transvaal to find itself in the ident posit from which we
reliev it by the annex
what cours event will then take it is imposs to sai it mai be
found desir to reannex the countri though in my opinion
that would be after all that ha pass an unfortun step it
inhabit mai be cut up piecem by a combin movement of nativ
tribe as thei would have been had thei not been rescu by the
english govern in 1877 or it is possibl that the orang free state
mai consent to take the transvaal under it wing who can sai there is
onli on thing that our recent abandon possess can count on for
certain and that is troubl both from it white subject and the
nativ who hate the boer with a bitter and a wellearn hatr
the whole question can so far as it moral aspect is concern be
sum up in a few word
whether or no the annex wa a necess at the moment of it
executionwhich i certainli maintain it wasit receiv the
unreserv sanction of the home author and the relat of
sovereign and subject with all the mani and mutual oblig involv
in that connect were establish between the queen of england and
everi individu of the motlei popul of the transvaal nor wa thi
chang an empti form for to the largest proport of that popul
thi transfer of allegi brought with it a priceless and a vital
boon to them it meantfreedom and justicefor where on ani portion
of thi globe over which the british ensign float doe the law even
wink at cruelti or wrong
a few year pass awai and a small number of the queen subject in
the transvaal rose in rebellion against her author and inflict
some revers on her arm thereupon in spite of the reiter pledg
given to the contrarypartli under stress of defeat and partli
in obedi to the pressur of advanc viewsth countri wa
abandon and the vast major who had remain faith to the crown
wa hand to the cruel despot of the minor who had rebel
against it
such an act of treacheri to those to whom we were bound with doubl
chainsbi the strong ti of a common citizenship and by those claim
to england protect from violenc and wrong which have hitherto
been wont to command it even where there wa no duti to fulfil and
no author to vindicatestandsi believewithout parallel on our
record and mark a new departur in our histori
i cannot end these page without express my admir of the
extrem abl wai in which the boer manag their revolt when onc
thei felt that have undertaken the thing it wa a question of
life and death with them it show that thei have good stuff in them
somewher which under the firm but just rule of her majesti might
have been much develop and it make it the more sad that thei should
have been led to throw off that rule and have been allow to do so by
an english govern
in conclus there is on point that i must touch on and that is the
effect of the retrocess on the nativ mind which i can onli describ
as most disastr the danger allud to in the report of the royal
commiss ha been most ampli realis and the prevail belief in
the steadfast of our polici and the inviol of our plight
word which ha hitherto been the great secret of our hold on the
kafir ha been rude shaken the motiv that influenc or ar said
to have influenc the govern in their act ar natur quit
unintellig to savag howev clever who do believ that forc
is a remedi and who have seen the inhabit of a countri rule by
england defeat english soldier and take possess of it whilst those
who remain loyal to england were driven out of it it will not be
wonder if some of them sai the nativ of natal deduc therefrom
conclus unfavour to loyalti and evinc a desir to try the same
experi
it is howev unprofit to specul on the futur which must be
left to unfold itself
the curtain is so far as thi countri is concern down for the moment
on the south african stage when it rise again there is but too much
reason to fear that it will reveal a state of confus which unless
it is more wise and consist dealt with in the futur than it ha
been in the past mai develop into chao

i
the potchefstroom atroc c
there were more murder and act of cruelti commit dure the war
at potchefstroom where the behaviour of the boer wa throughout both
deceit and savag than at ani other place
when the fight commenc a number of ladi and children the wive
and children of english resid took refug in the fort shortli
after it had been invest thei appli to be allow to return to their
home in the town till the war wa over the request wa refus by the
boer command who said that as thei had gone there thei might stop
and perish there on poor ladi the wife of a gentleman well known in
the transvaal wa badli wound by have the point of a stake which
had been cut in two by a bullet driven into her side she wa at the
time in a state of pregnanc and di some dai afterward in great
agoni her littl sister wa shot through the throat and sever other
women and children suffer from bullet wound and fever aris from
their be oblig to live for month expos to rain and heat with
insuffici food
the move spirit of all the potchefstroom atroc wa a cruel wretch
of the name of busk a welleduc man who as an advoc of the
high court had taken the oath of allegi to the queen
on depon swear that he saw thi busk wear captain fall
diamond ring which he had taken from sergeant ritchi to whom it wa
hand to be sent to england and also that he had possess himself
of the carriag and other good belong to prison taken by the

precautionari reason swear that on the next night the patrol again
came to my hous accompani by on busk who wa secretari of the

repli in bed and busk then said i must see for myself i
refus to allow him and he forc me with a load gun held to my
breast to open the curtain of the bed when he pull the bedcloth
half off my wife and altogeth off my daughter i then told him if i
had a gun i would shoot him he place a load gun at my breast when
my wife sprang out of bed and got between us
busk wa afterward forc to deliv up the ring
i rememb hear at the time that thi busk who is a good musician
took on of hi victim who wa on the wai to execut into the
chapel and plai the dead march in saul or some such piec over him
on the organ
after the captur of the court hous a good mani englishmen fell into
the hand of the boer most of these were sentenc to hard labour and
depriv of civil right the sentenc wa enforc by make them
work in the trench under a heavi fire from the fort on poor fellow
f w finlai by name got hi head blown off by a shell from hi own
friend in the fort and sever loyal kafir suffer the same fate
after these event the remain prison refus to return to the
trench till thei had been tame by be thrash with the butt end
of gun and by threat of receiv twentyf lash each
but their fate bad as it wa wa not so aw as that suffer by dr
woit and j van der linden
dr woit had attend the boer meet which wa held befor the
outbreak and written a letter from thenc to major clark in which he
had describ the talk of the boer as silli bluster he wa not a paid
spy thi letter wa unfortun for him found in major clark
pocketbook and becaus of it he wa put through a form of trial taken
out and shot dead all on the same dai he left a wife and larg famili
who afterward found their wai to natal in a destitut condit
the case of van der linden is somewhat similar he wa on of raaf
volunt and as such had taken the oath of allegi to the queen
in the execut of hi duti he made a report to hi command offic
about the boer meet and which afterward fell into the hand of the
boer on thi he wa put through the form of trial and though in
the servic of the queen wa found guilti of treason and condemn to
death on of hi judg a littl less stonyheart than the rest
point out that when the prison commit the crime martial law had
not yet been proclaim nor the state but it avail him noth he
wa taken out and shot
a kafir name carolu wa also put through the form of trial and shot
for no crime at all that i can discov
ten unarm kafir driver who had been sent awai from the fort were
shot down in cold blood by a parti of boer sever wit depos to
have seen their remain ly togeth close to potchefstroom
variou other kafir were shot none of the perpetr of these crime
were brought to justic the royal commiss comment on these act as
follow
in regard to the death of woit van de linden and carolu the
boer leader do not deni the fact that those men had been execut but
sought to justifi it the major of your commission felt bound to
record their opinion that the take of the live of these men wa an
act contrari to the rule of civilis warfar sir h de villier wa
of opinion that the execut in these case have been order by
properli constitut court martial of the boer forc after due trial
did not fall under the cognis of your commission
upon the case of william finlai the major of your commission felt
bound to record the opinion that the sacrific of finlai life through
forc labour under fire in the trench wa an act contrari to the
rule of civilis warfar sir h de villier did not feel justifi
by the fact of the case in join in thi express of opinion
sic as to the case of the kafir andri your commission decid
that although the shoot of thi man appear to them from the
inform laid befor them to be not in accord with the rule of
civilis warfar under all the circumst of the case it wa not
desir to insist upon a prosecut
the major of your commission although feel it a duti to
record emphat their disapprov of the act that result in
the death of woit van der linden finlai and carolu yet found it
imposs to bring to justic the person guilti of these act
it will be observ that sir h de villier doe not express ani
disapprov emphat or otherwis of these wick murder
but potchefstroom did not enjoi a monopoli of murder
in decemb 1880 captain elliot who wa a survivor from the bronker
spruit massacr and captain lambart who had been taken prison by the
boer whilst bring remount from the free state were releas from
heidelberg on parol on condit that thei left the countri an escort
of two men brought them to a drift of the vaal river where thei refus
to cross becaus thei could not get their cart through the river be
in flood the escort then return to heidelberg and report that the
offic would not cross a civil note wa then sent back to captain
elliot and lambart sign by p j joubert tell them to pass the
vaal river immedi by the road that will be shown to you what
secret order if ani were sent with thi letter ha never transpir
but i declin to believ that either in thi or in barber case the
boer escort took upon themselv the respons of murder their
prison without author of some kind for the deed
the men despatch from heidelberg with the letter found lambert and
elliot wander about and try to find the wai to standerton thei
present the letter and took them toward a drift in the vaal shortli
befor thei got there the prison notic that their escort had been
reinforc it would be interest to know if these extra men were not
sent to assist in the murder how and why thei turn up as thei did and
join themselv to the escort the prison were taken to an old and
disus drift of the vaal river and told to cross it wa now dark and
the river wa much swollen with rain in fact impass for the cart
and hors captain elliot and lambart beg to be allow to outspan
till the next morn but were told that thei must cross which thei
accordingli attempt to do a few yard from the bank the cart stuck on
a rock and whilst in thi posit the boer escort pour a vollei into
it poor elliot wa instantli kill on bullet fractur hi skull
anoth pass through the back a third shatter the right thigh
and a fourth break the left wrist the cart wa also riddl but
strang to sai captain lambert wa untouch and succeed in swim
to the further bank the boer fire at him whenev the flash of
lightn reveal hi whereabout after stick some time in the mud
of the bank he manag to effect hi escap and next dai reach the
hous of an englishman call groom live in the free state and from
thenc made hi wai to natal
two of the murder were put through a form of trial after the
conclus of peac and acquit
the case of the murder of dr barber is of a somewhat similar charact
to that of elliot except that there is in thi case a curiou piec of
indirect evid that seem to connect the murder directli with piet
joubert on of the triumvir
in the month of februari 1881 two englishmen came to the boer laager
at lang nek to offer their servic as doctor their name were dr
barber who wa well known to the boer and hi assist mr walter
dya and thei came not from natal but the orang free state on
arriv at the boer camp thei were at first well receiv but after
a littl while seiz search and ti up all night to a disselboom
pole of a waggon next morn thei were told to mount their hors
and start from the camp escort by two men who were to take them over
the free state line
when thei reach the free state line the boer told them to get off
their hors which thei were order to bring back to the camp thei
did so bade gooddai to their escort and start to walk on toward
their destin when thei had gone about forti yard dya heard the
report of a rifl and barber call out my god i am shot and fell
dead
dya went down on hi hand and knee and saw on of the escort
deliber aim at him he then jump up and ran dodg from right
to left try to avoid the bullet present the man fire and he
felt himself struck through the thigh he fell with hi face to the men
and saw hi wouldb assassin put a fresh cartridg into hi rifl and
aim at him turn hi face to the ground he await hi death but the
bullet whizz past hi head he then saw the men take the hors and go
awai think thei had finish him after wait a while he manag
to get up and struggl to a hous not far off where he wa kindli
treat and remain till he recov
some time after thi occurr a hottentot name allan smith made
a statement at newcastl from which it appear that he had been taken
prison by the boer and made to work for them on night he saw barber
and dya ti to the disselboom and overheard the follow which i
will give in hi own word
i went to a fire where some boer were sit among them wa
a lowsiz man moder stout with a darkbrown full beard
appar about thirtyf year of ag i do not know hi name he
wa tell hi comrad that he had brought an order from piet joubert
to viljoen to take the two prison to the free state line and shoot
them there he said in the cours of convers piet joubert het
gevraacht waarom wa de mensch neet dood geschiet toen hull bijd
eerst laager gekom het piet joubert ask why were the men not shot
when thei came to the first laager thei then saw me at the fire and
on of them said you must not talk befor that fellow he understand
what you sai and will tell everybodi
next morn viljoen told me to go awai and gave me a pass into the
free state he said in dutch you must not drive for ani englishmen
again if we catch you do so we will shoot you and if you do not go
awai quick and we catch you hang about when we bring the two men to
the line we will shoot you too
dya who escap made an affidavit with refer to thi statement in
which he sai i have read the forego affidavit of allan smith
and i sai that the person describ in the third paragraph thereof as
bring order from piet joubert to viljoen correspond with on of
the boer who took dr barber and myself to the free state and to the
best of my belief he is the man who shot dr barber
the actual murder were put on their trial in the free state and of
cours acquit in hi examin at the trial allan smith sai
it wa a young man who said that joubert had given order that barber
had to be shot it wa not at night but in the morn earli
when the young man spoke about piet joubert order
most peopl will gather from what i have quot that there exist a
certain connect between the dastardli murder of dr barber and the
attempt murder of mr dya and piet joubert on of that abl
triumvir of which mr gladston speak so highli
i shall onli allud to on more murder though more ar report to have
occur amongst themthat of mr malcolm who wa kick to death by
boersand that is mr green
mr green wa an english golddigg and wa travel along the main
road to hi home at spitzcop the road pass close by the militari camp
at lydenburg into which he wa call on come out he went to a boer
patrol with a flag of truce and whilst talk to them wa shot dead
the rev j thorn the english clergyman at lydenburg describ thi
murder in an affidavit in the follow word
that i wa the clergyman who got togeth a parti of englishmen and
brought down the bodi of mr green who wa murder by the boer and
buri it i have ascertain the circumst of the murder which
were as followsmr green wa on hi wai to the goldfield as he wa
pass the fort he wa call in by the offic and sent out again
with a messag to the boer command immedi on leav the camp
he went to the boer guard opposit with a flag of truce in hi hand
while parlei with the boer who propos to make a prison of him
he wa shot through the head
no prosecut wa institut in thi case mr green left a wife and
children in a destitut condit

retrocess of the transvaal ar not without interest

to sir bartl frere in which the follow word occur under
no circumst can the queen author in the transvaal be
relinquish
in a despatch date 20th mai and address to sir bartl frere lord
kimberlei sai that the sovereignti of the queen in the transvaal
could not be relinquish
in a speech in the hous of lord on the 24th mai 1880 lord kimberlei
said
there wa a still stronger reason than that for not reced it wa
imposs to sai what calam such a step as reced might not
caus we had at the cost of much blood and treasur restor peac
and the effect of our now revers our polici would be to leav the
provinc in a state of anarchi and possibl to caus an internecin
war for such a risk he could not make himself respons the number
of the nativ in the transvaal wa estim at about 800000 and
that of the white less than 500000 difficulti with the zulu and
frontier tribe would again aris and look as thei must to south
africa as a whole the govern after a care consider of
the question came to the conclus that we could not relinquish
the transvaal noth could be more unfortun than uncertainti in
respect to such a matter
on the 8th june 1880 mr gladston in repli to a boer memori wrote
as follow
it is undoubtedli a matter for much regret that it should sinc the
annex have appear that so larg a number of the popul of
dutch origin in the transvaal ar oppos to the annex of that
territori but it is imposs now to consid that question as if it
were present for the first time we have to do with a state of thing
which ha exist for a consider period dure which oblig
have been contract especi though not exclus toward
the nativ popul which cannot be set asid look to all the
circumst both of the transvaal and the rest of south africa and
to the necess of prevent a renew of disord which might lead
to disastr consequ not onli to the transvaal but to the whole
of south africa our judgment is that the queen cannot be advis to
relinquish the transvaal

a boer advertis
it mai be interest to englishmen to know what treatment is mete out
to such of their fellowcountrymen as have been bold enough or forc
by necess to remain in the transvaal sinc the retrocess the
follow is a translat of an advertis recent publish in the
volkstem a transvaal paper and is a fair sampl of what loyalist
have to expect
warn
we the undersign burgher of the ward aapi river herebi warn all
loyal person who have regist themselv with the british resid
that thei ar not to come into our hous or into our farm and still
less to offer to shake hand thei can greet us at a distanc on the
road like kafir and those who act contrari to thi notic can expect
the result
presum the result that the englishman who take the liberti
to offer to shake hand with a boer can expect is to be beaten or
murder thi notic is sign by the justic of the peac or veld
cornet of the district anybodi who know the estim in which a
kafir is held by the boer will understand it peculiar insol
v
transvaal letter to the standard
the follow letter appear in the issu of the standard of the 31st
mai 1882 and is date pretoria 27th april it is sign transvaal
probabl becaus the author were he to put hi name at the foot of so
candid a document would find himself in much the same posit as that
occupi at the present moment by an irish landlord who ha outrag the
suscept of the land leagu he would be rigor boycot
and might in the event of ani disturb be made into a target the
transvaal boer ar veri sensit to critic especi where their
nativ polici is concern i take the liberti to reprint the letter
here partli becaus i feel sure that i will be forward the wish
of the writer by assist to give public to hi fact and partli
on account of the strike and recent confirm it afford on everi
point to my remark on the same subject
sirin call your attent to what is go on on the
southwestern border of the transvaal i mai possibl tell you of some
thing which you mai alreadi have heard of for in the present isol
condit of the countri without telegraph and with a veri imperfect
postal system ad to the jealousi of the boer govern in keep
their action secret from the outsid world it is not onli veri
difficult to get at the truth of what is happen but the peopl in
on portion of the countri ar in mani case total ignor of what is
go on in anoth nevertheless i feel it incumb on me to call
the attent of the english peopl through your wide circul
journal to what ha come under my observ with refer to the
disgrac nativ war which is and ha been rage on the southwest
border of thi countri
dure the late boer war you mai be awar of the fact that a veri
larg number if not all of the nativ were strongli in favour of
the english govern and onli await the signal from it to rush upon
their old oppressor but the nativ although forbidden by the english
govern from join with them against the boer it is hardli
necessari to sai that had it not been for thi the war would have had a
veri differ end nevertheless afford an asylum and protect
to the live and properti of refuge englishmen and loyalist notabl
among these nativ wa a chief name montsiou whose tribe is situat
just outsid the border of the transvaal to the southwest thi
chief and hi peopl receiv number of refuge who fled to them for
protect from the rapac of the boer and watch over them and
their properti throughout the war for thi offenc the boer swore to
be reveng on him and hardli wa the war finish when thei commenc
command in the potchefstroom district under the pretenc of
protect their border but with the ostens purpos of inflict
chastis on thi loyal chief and the better to effect their
purpos thei alli themselv with a neighbour chief who had some
old grudg against him and by promis of assist and hope of
plunder induc him to commenc a war under cover of which thei could
join and thu effect the purpos thei had in view
the chief whom the boer had instig to harass montsiou got
the worst of it and the action of the boer who were activ
command in the potchefstroom district under command crong
wa brought to the notic of the royal commiss through complaint
made by loyal boer and result in an inquiri into the subject which
show that hi oppon wa the aggressor and wa act under the
advic of and assist from the boer the royal commiss manag to
patch matter up but no sooner were their labour over and the countri
fairli hand over to the boer than moshet and masouw instig by
the boer commenc again harass montsiou with the avow purpos
of bring on a war and so far succeed as to oblig montsiou to take
up arm in selfdef
from that time forward the war ha gone on increas in dimens
until other chief have been drawn into it and the boer volunt
fight against montsiou and monkoroan ar almost equal in number to
the nativ the boer while do all thei can to crush montsiou on
account of the protect he afford loyalist dure the late war
against the english govern ar care not to do it in an offici
wai becaus that might caus troubl with england wherea by
aid and assist it privat thei could do quit as much without
incur respons you mai natur ask how i know all thi and
what proof i can advanc in support of it some time after the royal
commiss had left the countri and the war had commenc again piet
joubert who is commandantgener went down to the border with the
object of put an end to the war thi i presum he did for the
sake of appear for it is well known that he entertain a strong
hatr against those nativ who in ani wai show a partial for
british rule and when it is rememb that piet joubert journei did
not result in a cessat of hostil but in an increas and that
ever sinc hi journei the war ha increas in area and in number
and that in no singl instanc ha a boer volunt been prevent
from cross the border or ammunit for us against montsiou been
stop the sincer of hi intent mai well be doubt
then again offic in the boer jager went about pretoria
endeavour to obtain volunt to fight against montsiou sai
that thei were to have some month leav from the govern and that
subscript would be rais to assist those men who had no privat
mean thi took place almost immedi after piet joubert return
from the border and while he wa in pretoria and the gener opinion
wa that he wa at the bottom of it but as it becam rather more public
than wa intend the british resid wa oblig to take notic of
it and the result wa that the boer though in gener treat the
british resid with littl consider thought it wisest to carri
on their oper in a more privat manner more especi as their
object could be attain quit as effectu in thi wai
while the boer ar assist moshet and masouw by everi mean in
their power with the sole object of crush montsiou and monkoroan
anoth loyal chief the coloni govern no doubt under
instruct from home ar do their best to prevent volunt or
ammunit reach them and have alreadi rest men in kimberlei who
have been try to rais volunt to go to their assist
the result of thi is that the loyal chief ar suffer under
a doubl disadvantag for while their enemi ar receiv everi
assist thei ar blockad on all side and through the action
of the english govern in prevent them obtain assist ar
rapidli fall a prei to the boer those onli who know anyth of the
boer method of warfar against nativ will know what thi mean and in
spite of the boer govern do all thei can to keep thing
secret horribl tale of the cruelti perpetr by them leak out
occasion
it seem to me a disgrac thing and a stain on the honour of
england that these loyal chief and their tribe should be rob
plunder and shot down like dog simpli becaus thei afford
protect to the live and properti of englishmen dure the late
war and yet these thing ar go on and ar be perpetr on the
border of england coloni if england will not step in and insist on
the boer put a stop to thi murder war then in god name
let her not prevent these poor nativ from obtain ammunit and
assist to enabl them to defend their countri thei succour our
countrymen and if we cannot succour them the least we can do is not to
interfer to prevent them from protect themselv
of cours it suit the boer govern to make out that thei have
noth to do with the war and cannot prevent boer volunt from
fight these chief and so long as the english govern rest
satisfi with these answer so long will thi disgrac state of
thing go on let the english govern be firm howev and insist
on the boer take no part in thi war and it will ceasea sure proof
that the boer govern have the power to stop it if thei have the
will
not onli ar the boer wreak vengeanc upon montsiou and monkoroan
but a friend of their a chief of the name of kalafin whose tribe is
situat in the zeerust district transvaal ha been rob by them of
everyth he possess thi chief had english sympathi and as he
presum to build a wall round hi town he gave the boer the excus
thei want he wa order to take the wall down which he did at the
same time prove that he onli built it to prevent hi cattl strai
among the hut he wa then order to come to pretoria which he did
accordingli he wa then order to pai a fine of three thousand cattl
which fine he paid no sooner wa thi done than the boer bent on
hi ruin rais the fine to ten thousand head the poor chief in vain
plead hi inabl to pai it wa the old stori of the wolf and the
lamb becaus he couldnt pai the boer constru it into an act of
disobedi and at onc order their men to go in and take everyth
he possess thi tribe is small and weak which the boer well knew
eyewit of what follow sai it wa a heartrend sight the
women with children in their arm plead in vain to the boer to
leav them someth or thei would starv but the latter onli jeer
at them what these poor peopl will do god onli know for the boer
strip them of everi live thing thei possess and with the
proce of thi robberi the boer govern intend to replenish their
coffer
the british resid mr hudson it is believ shut hi ey to
mani thing no doubt hi is a difficult posit to fill and doubtless
he is awar that if he report everyth to the english govern
the boer have it in their power to make hi posit anyth but a
pleasant on in ani case the english portion of the commun here
while admit hi good qualiti social have littl confid in
him offici
my object in write thi letter howev is not so much to show what
a disgrac state the govern is in as to try and awaken sympathi
in the breast of my countrymen for the caus of these loyal chief
while the govern ar write despatch to the british resid
these chief and their peopl ar be ruin past remedi

a visit to the chief secocoeni
thi paper wa written just befor the annex of the
transvaal in 1877
toward the end of march i had occas to visit the basuto chief
secocoeni in hi nativ stronghold beyond the loolu berg a rang to
the northeast of pretoria about 250 mile awai and as thi journei
wa typic of travel in the wild of south africa an account of it
mai prove interest
it is perhap necessari to explain for the benefit of those who ar not
acquaint with south african polit that secocoeni is the chieftain
who ha been at war with the late transvaal republ who drove back it
forc captur some 7000 head of cattl it is from thi raid that
the present state of affair ha arisen so that thi obscur chief
with hi 9000 warrior ha materi affect the futur destini of
south africa negoti of peac had been set on foot and it wa
in connect with these delic matter that the journei wa to be
undertaken
go to secocoeni at thi time of year ah said on gentleman
well look here i sent five nativ through that countri in thi same
month march last year out of those five three di of the fever and
the other two just got through with their live i onli tell you you
know that you mai take precaut thi is a bad fever year howev
fever or no fever we had to go as it wa necessari to travel rapidli
we could onli take four ridinghors three for ourselv and the
fourth for a zulu name lankiboi who also led a packhors
and carri an enorm knobkerri or shillelagh stuck in hi
buttonhol as though it were a weddingbouquet
behind our saddl were fasten our saddlebag contain a chang

complet our equip
we knew littl of our rout save that our destin lai due east so
due east we steer after ride for about twenti mile and cross
the mahaliesburg rang that stretch awai north for hundr of mile
we came to a boer hous where we offsaddl to feed our hors it
must be understood that the boer were the on certain difficulti and
on of the possibl danger to be encount on our road for at no
time ar thei ar pleasant peopl to deal with and just now thei ar
remark unpleas toward englishmen
for instanc at thi first hous we manag to get some forag for our

fellow final we succeed in bui three cup of milk for a
shill as a favour and that is all we got from sunris to sunset
ride on empti stomach for anoth sixti mile over the plain we
came to a boer hous where we had to sleep just befor we reach the
door i notic what i have often seen sinc some grave in a row with
heap of stone pile over them it appear that these peopl do not
care about bring buri in consecr ground their onli anxieti be
to be put in a coffin and thei ar gener laid to rest near to their
door there is neither rail nor headston and no tree or flower
those green emblemat garment with which civilis peopl try to hide
the ugli of death i rememb onc see sever grave within two
or three yard of the public road so that in a year or so the waggon
will be rumbl over the head of those who lie beneath
when you ride up to a boer hous the etiquett is to wait until some
member of the famili ask you to offsaddl and then you must go in
and shake hand with everi on a most disagre custom none of the
womenwho ar veri plainris to meet on thei just hold out their
hand thi hous wa a fair specimen of the sort of habit indulg
in by the ordinari boer the main room wa about eighteen feet squar
with that kind of door which allow the upper half to open whilst the
lower remain shut such as is us in stabl in england the floor
is made of cowdung into which peach stone ar trodden at the
threshold in order to prevent it wear awai the furnitur consist
of a deal tabl and some chair rather nearli made of strip of hide
fasten to a wooden frame there is no ceil but onli beam to

sun out of thi room open on or two more in which the whole famili
sleep without much attempt at privaci
sit about the room were two or three young mother without
stock and nurs babi in the corner on a chair made twice as
larg as ani of the other repos the mother of the famili a woman of
larg size the whole hous wa pervad by a sickli odour like that of
a vault whilst the grime and filth of it baffl descript and thi

it the onli thing to do wa to light on pipe and smoke after an
hour or so supper wa put upon the tabl consist of a bowl full of
boil bone a small stack of meali cob and be it ad some good

with a reek oxhid just torn from the anim ly on the floor
besid us togeth with portion of the poor beast head whose flesh
we were eat howev on thi occas we were spare the oxhid
and be veri hungri manag to put up with the other discomfort
after a long grace our supper were serv out to us i rememb i got
an enorm bone with but littl flesh on it which if i mai form an
opinion from it great size and from a rapid anatom survei must
have been the tibia of an ox a young boer sat opposit to mea
wonder fellow he got through sever meali cob and larg on
too whilst i wa eat half a on hi method wa peculiar and show
what practic can do he shove a meali cob into hi mouth gave it
a bite and a wrench just like on of those patent american thresh
machin brought the cob out perfectli clear of grain and took
anoth after the supper wa over we had anoth long grace end
with voor spijz en drunk de heer ik dank for food and drink the

after supper we went outsid in order to escap the feetwash
ceremoni all in the same water which thi simpl pastor peopl
ar said to indulg in and which thei might expect the uitland
stranger to enter into with enthusiasm when we came back we
found that the womenwho bythebi do not eat till the men have
finishedhad done their meal and gone to bed have first made us up
a luxuri couch on the floor consist of a filthi featherb and
an equal filthi blanket my heart misgav me when i look at that
bed it mai have been fanci but onc or twice i thought it move
howev there wa no choic unless we chose to sit up all night so in
we got look for all the world like three big sunburn doll put
to bed by some littl girl i as the youngest blew out the light and
thenfrom everi side thei came up on arm up on leg
down on back thei scamper till life becam a burden sleep wa
imposs on could onli lie awak and calcul the bite per minut
and the quantiti of blood on would lose befor daybreak cold as it
wa i would have turn out and slept in the veldt onli my rug wa
over my two companion as well as myself so i could not take it i have
slept in a good mani differ place and in veri fairli uncomfort
place but i never had such a night befor
at the first grei dawn of morn the old frau came stumbl out of
the bedroom and sat down without ceremoni in her big chair wait
till she thought that we had reach a suffici advanc stage in
our toiletteand her idea of what that wa must have been a strang
onesh shout out to her daughter that thei could com and in thei
all came veri glad were we when we had paid our bill which wa a heavi
on and were in the saddl onc more ride through the cold morn
mist that lai in mass on all the ridg of the hill like snow on
mountain
it wa need to start earli for we had more than sixti mile to
cover and our poni had done a good journei the dai befor the work
that on can get out of these poni is marvel there wa my poni
mettl who had my eleven stone to carri to sai noth of the
saddl heavi saddlebag and a roll of rug who came in at the end
of hi journei as fresh as paint we canter easili over the great
highveldt prairi now and then pass clump of tree outpost
of the bushveldt these enorm plain notwithstand their dreari
vast have a wild beauti of their own the grass is what is call
sour grass and ha a peculiar blue ting but stock do not like it so
well as the lowveldt grass which is sweeter and fatten them more
quickli though it doe not put them in such good fettl the rock here
is all white sandston and thinli overlap an enorm bed of coal
crop up from beneath the waterwash surfac at thi time of year
there ar veri few beast or bird of ani sort to be seen though in the
winter the veldt is on move mass of trek or migratori game
our destin that dai wa botsabelo the most import
missionst and on of the veri few success on in
southeastern africa as we near it the countri gradual broke into
hill of peculiar and beauti format which render the last two
hour of our ride in the dark through an unknown countri rather a
difficult job howev we stumbl through stream and over boulder
and about nine oclock were lucki enough to come right upon the station
where we were most kindli receiv by dr merenski the station itself
stand on the brow of a hill surround by garden and orchard beneath
it lie slope and mountain stream and vallei over which ar dot
number of kraal to sai noth of three or four substanti hous
occupi by the assist missionari and german artisan near dr
merenski hous stand the church by far the best i have seen in the
transvaal and there is also a store with some wellbuilt workshop
around it all the neighbour countri belong to the station which
is in fact like a small independ state 40000 acr in extent
on a hilltop overshadow the station ar place the fortif
consist of thick wall run in a circl with upstand tower
in which stand on or two cannon but it all remind on more of an old
norman keep with it villag cluster in it protect shadow than
of a modern mission establish
dr merenski commenc hi labour in secocoeni countri but wa
forc to fly from thenc by night with hi wife and newborn babi
to escap be murder by that chief order who like most kafir
potent ha an intens avers to missionari twelv year ago he
establish thi station and gather hi scatter convert around
him defi secocoeni to drive him thenc twice that chief ha sent out
a forc to sweep him awai and murder hi peopl and twice thei have
come and look and like fals sextu turn back again the boer
too have more than onc threaten to destroi him for it is unpleas
to them to have so intellig a wit in their midst but thei have
never dare to try the place is realli impregn to basutu and
boer zulu might carri it with their grand steadi rush but it would
be at a terribl sacrific of life in fact dr merenski ha been
forc by the pressur of circumst to teach hi men the us of a
rifl as well as the truth of christian to trust in god but also
to keep their powder dry at a few minut notic he can turn out 200
wellarm nativ readi for offenc or defenc and the exist
of such a stronghold is of great advantag to the few english in the
neighbourhood for the boer know well that should thei attack them
thei might draw down the vengeanc of dr merenski formid bodi of
christian soldier
we onli pass on night at botsabelo and next morn went on to
middelburg or nazareth which is an hour ride from the station here
too we met with a warm welcom from the hand of english resid
but we were eager to push on as rapidli as possibl for our kind
friend told us that it would be imposs to proce to secocoeni on
horseback becaus of the deadli natur of the countri for hors so
we had to hire an oxwaggon which thei provis for us and much to
our disgust as we were press for time were oblig to fall back on
that dilatori method of travel
we decid that we would take the three oldest and least valuabl hors
with us in order to proce with them from fort weeber which wa our
next point to secocoeni town whither waggon could not reach few
english reader ar awar that there is a mysteri diseas
among hors in south africa peculiar to the countri call
horsesick dure the autumn season it carri off thousand of
hors annual though some ar good and other bad yearsa bad fever
year be gener a bad horsesick year also and vice versa
a curiou featur about it is that as the veldt get tame that is
fed off by domest anim the sick gradual disappear
no cure ha yet been discov for it and veri few hors pull
throughperhap five per cent these ar call salt hors and
ar veri valuabl as although thei ar not proof against the diseas
thei ar not so liabl to take it a salt hors mai be known by the
peculiar loos and rough of hi skin and also by a
certain unmistak air of depress as though he felt that the
respons of life press veri heavili upon him he is like a man
who ha dearli bought hi experi he can never forget the terribl
lesson taught in the bui
on the fourth dai from our start we left middelburg and take a
northeast cours from thi outpost of civilis overtook the
waggon and camp after a twenti mile trek just on the edg of the
bushveldt we had two young boer to drive our waggonsterr lout
howev thei understood how to drive a waggon and whilst on of them
drove the other would sit for hour with a vacant stare on hi face
think it is a solemn fact that from the time we left middelburg
till the time we return neither of those fellow touch water that
is to wash themselv the onli luxuri in the shape of comfort of the
toilett which thei allow themselv wa a comb with a brass back
carefulli ti to the roof of the waggon with two strip of oxhid
thick enough to have held a hundredweight of lead i dont think thei
ever us itit wa too great a luxuri for gener usebut thei would
occasion unti it and look at it our own outfit in the waggon wa
necessarili scanti consist of a few iron pot and plate a kettl
some green blanket a lantern and an old antifrict greasecan us
for water which gave it a fine flavour of waggonwheel we also had
a cartl or wooden frame across which were stretch strip of hide
fit into the waggon about two feet abov the floor and intend to
sleep on but the less said about that the better
after we left the great highveldt plain over which the fresh breez
wa sweep we drop down into a beauti bushclad vallei with
mountain on either side it wa like make a sudden descent into the
tropic not a breath of wind stir the tree and the sun shone with
a steadi burn heat scarc a sound broke the silenc save the
murmur of the river we cross and recross the occasion pipe of a
bird and the melancholi cry half sigh half bark of an old baboon
who wa swing himself along indign at our presenc
if the sight and sound were beauti the sun wa hot and the road
fear and we were inde glad when we reach whitehead cobalt
mine and were most kindli receiv by the gentlemen who superintend
the work the hous us to belong to some boer who had desert
the place but left behind him a beauti orchard of orang and peach
tree the place is veri feverish and unhealthi and the white ant
so troublesom that everyth ha to be stood in sardin tin full of
ash
on our wai from the hous we went to see the cobalt mine which is on
a hillsid a mile awai it ha onli been establish about three year
and ha exist hitherto under the greatest difficulti as regard
labour transport machineri danger from surround nativ tribe
c but it ha alreadi the proprietor inform me reduc the price
of cobaltth blue dye us to colour such thing as the willowpattern
platesbi onehalf in the english market bring it down from
somewher about 140 pound to 80 pound a ton we were veri much
astonish to see the amount of work which had been done as we expect
to find a pit such as the kafir work for copper but instead of that
there wa a larg slant shaft quit a hundr yard long to sai
noth of variou open out of it follow branch lead of or
there is also a vertic shaft on hundr feet deep through which the
or come up and by which on can ascend and descend in a bucket after
we emerg from thi aw hole we went into anoth a drive run
straight into the mountain for more than three hundr feet follow a
vein of black oxid of cobalt which is much more valuabl than the or
and though the vein is rare more than a foot in thick pai
veri well leav the mine we rode on past some old kafir
copperworkingscircular pitswhich must have been abandon to judg
from their appear a hundr year ago till we came to the bank
of the great olif or eleph river thi magnific stream
though it is unnavig ow to frequent rapid ha stretch mile
long down which a manofwar could steam and after it junction with
the eland river it grow larger and larger till pursu a northeast
cours it at length fall into the mighti limpopo it is a veri
majest but somewhat sluggish stream and it water is not veri good
you cannot see the river till you ar right upon it ow to the great
tree with which it steep bank ar fring and in the earli morn
it is quit hidden from bank to bank by a dens mass of billow of white
mist indescrib strang to look upon
but beauti as thi countri is it is most unhealthi for man and
beast the close odour the long creep line of mist the rich rank
veget the steadi heat of dai and night all sai on word fever
and fever of the most virul type the travel through thi sort of
countri is consciou of a latent fear lest he should some dai begin to
feel hot when he ought to be cold and cold when he ought to be hot and
so be stricken down to rise prematur old or perhap to die and be
buri in a lone grave cover with stone to keep off the jackal
we were travel in the veri worst fevermonth march when the summer
veget is commenc to rot and throw off it poison steam what
save us here and afterward at secocoeni wa our temper live
hard exercis and plenti of quinin and tobaccosmok
all the countri through which we were pass is good gameveldt but we
saw veri littl and kill noth thi wa chiefli ow to the fact
that we did not dare go out of hear of the waggonwheel for fear
of get lost in the bush a thing veri easili done a few year back
thi veldt swarm with big game with eleph and giraff and
thei ar even now occasion seen we manag now and again to get
a glimps of some of the beauti impala buck or of a small lot of
blue wilderbeest vanish between the tree like a troop of wild
hors there ar still plenti of lion about but we did not hear ani
whether it wa that thei had gone to the highveldt after the cattl or
that thei do not roar so much in summer i do not know perhap it is as
well that we did not for the roar of a lion is veri gener follow
by what the dutch call a skrech after roar onc or twice to wake
the cattl up and make them gener uneasi the lion station himself
about twenti yard to the windward of the waggon the oxen get wind of
him and promptli skrech that is break their rim and run madli into
the veldt thi is just what the lion want for now he can pick out a
fat ox and quietli approach him from the other side till he is within
spring distanc he then jump upon him crush hi neck with on
bite and eat him at hi leisur
and so we trek on through the sunris through the burn middai
and glow sunset steer by the sun and make our own road now
through tambouki grass higher than the oxen and now through dens bush
till at length on dai we said goodby to the olif just where
the eland river flow into it and turn our face eastward thi
cours soon brought us on to higher ground and awai from the mimosa
which love the low hot vallei into the region of the sugar bush
which thrive upon the hillsid thi sugar bush is a veri handsom
and peculiar plant with soft thick leav stand about twenti feet
high it bear a brushlik flower each of which in the cape coloni
contain half a teaspoon of delici honei but curious enough
though in other respect the tree is precis similar thi is not the
case in the transvaal or natal at the proper season the cape farmer
go out with bucket and shake the flower till thei have collect
suffici honei to last them for the winter a honei more fragrant than
that made by bee
after a long ride over the open which must onc have been thickli
popul to judg from the number of remain of kraal we came at
length to fort weeber the fort is veri badli situat in the hollow of
a plain and so surround by fine hill that it is entir command
it consist of a singl sod wall about two feet thick and five high
cap with loos stone whilst at two of the corner stand on rais
platform a sixpound and a threepound whitworth gun insid the
wall ar built row of mud hut which ar occupi by the garrison
leav an open squar in the midst of which is place the magazin we
found the garrison in a wretch condit thei have not receiv ani
pai except govern goodfor promissori note gener known as
goodfornoth so thei ar in a state of abject poverti whilst
thei ar render harmless as regard offens oper by the
death from horsesick of eightytwo of the nineti hors
thei own howev the offic and garrison gave us a veri grand
recept as we rode up thei fire a salut of twelv gun and then
after we had dismount and been receiv by the offic we were taken
through a lane made by the garrison drawn up in a doubl line and just
as we got to the middl bang went the eighti rifl over our
head then an address wa read the volunt ar great peopl for
address but a more practic welcom soon follow in the shape of a
good dinner
next morn we start a parti of seven includ the interpret
to ride over the loolu berg to secocoeni a distanc of about
thirtyeight mile
for the first five mile we pass through the most curiou granit
format a success of small hill entir compos of round
boulder of granit weigh from five to 1000 ton and look
exactli like pile of gigant snowbal hurl togeth by some mighti
hand the granit format prevail in all thi part of the countri
and individu boulder sometim take veri curiou shape for
instanc in the bushveldt we pass a great column tower high abov
the tree compos of six boulder get smaller and smaller from
the base up and each accur balanc on the on beneath it then
we cross the rang of hill which overlook the fort and pass
secocoeni old kraal where he us to live befor he retreat to hi
fast we arriv at a great alluvi vallei nine mile broad on
the other side of which rise the loolu it wa on thi plain that the
onli real fight between the volunt and secocoeni men took place
when the former manag to get between the basutu and the hill
and shot them down like game kill over 200 men leav the
battlefield where the skeleton still lie a littl to our right we
cross the plain and came to the foot of the loolu all along the base
of which stand neat villag inhabit by secocoeni peopl some of
these villag have been burnt by the volunt and the remaind ar
entir desert their inhabit have built fresh hut among the
rock in almost inaccess place the appear of these white hut
peep out all over the black rock wa veri curiou and remind on
of the swiss chalet
by the stream that run along past the villag we offsaddl as both
ourselv and our hors were nearli exhaust by the burn heat but
as there wa not much time to lose after a short rest we start off
again and rode on over a bed of magnet iron ly on the ground in
great lump of almost pure metal until we came to a stretch of what
look remark like goldbear quartz and then to a limeston
format the whole countri is evid rich beyond measur in
miner all thi time we were pass through sceneri inexpress
wild and grand and when we had arriv at the highest spot of the pass
it reach a climax of savag beauti about forti mile in front of us
tower up anoth magnific rang of blueting mountain known as
the blue berg whilst all around us rose great bushclad hill open
awai in everi direct toward gorgeouscolour vallei the scene wa
so grand and solemn that i do not think it li in the power of word to
describ it
here we had to dismount to descend a most fear precipit path
consist of boulder pile togeth in the wildest confus from
on to anoth of which we had to jump drive the hors befor us
halfwai down we offsaddl to rest ourselv and as we did so we
notic that the gall wa run from on of the hors nose we knew
too well what wa the matter and so left him there to die dure the
night thi hors wa by far the finest we had with us and hi owner
us to boast that the poor beast had often carri him a heavi man
from hi hous to pretoria a distanc of nearli nineti mile in
on dai he wa also a salt hors it is a curiou thing that the
sick gener kill the best hors first
after a short rest we start on again and at the end of anoth hour
reach the bottom of the pass from thenc we rode along a gullei that
altern narrow and widen till at length it brought us right on
to secocoeni beauti feverstricken home
all three of us had seen a good deal of sceneri in differ part
of the world and on of the parti wa intim acquaint with the
finest spot in south africa but we were forc to admit that we had
never seen anyth half so love as secocoeni vallei we had seen
grander view inde the scene from the top of the pass wa grander
but never anyth that so nearli approach perfect in detail
beauti it wa beauti beyond measur but it wa the sort of
beauti under whose veil ar hidden fever and death and so we push on
through the still hot eventid till at length we came to the gate
of the town where we found makurupiji secocoeni mouth or prime
minist who had evid been inform of our come by hi spi
wait to receiv us
makurupiji commit suicid after the town had been storm
prefer death to imprison
conduct by thi grande we went on past the chief kraal down to
the town whenc flock men women and children to look on the white
lord all in a primit state of dress consist of a strip of skin
ti round the middl and the women with their hair powder with some
prepar of iron which gave it a metal blue ting
at length we stop just opposit a beauti fortifi kopj
perfor by secret cave where the ammunit of the tribe is hidden
no stranger is allow to enter these cave or even to ascend the
kopj though thei do not object to on inspect some of the other
fortif dismount from our weari hors we pass through a
cattl kraal and came into the presenc of swasi secocoeni uncl
a fat old fellow who wa busili engag in brai a skin nearli everi
male basutu on meet be he high or low is brai a hide of some
sort either by rub or by mastic it it is a curiou sight to
come across some twenti of these fellow everi on of them twist or
chew awai
afterward storm in the attack on secocoeni town by
sir garnet wolselei
swasi wa a sort of master of the household hi duti it wa to receiv
stranger and see that thei were properli look after so after
shake hand with us furious he wa a wonder fellow to shake
hand he conduct us to our hut it stood in a goodsiz courtyard
beautifulli pave with a sort of concret of limeston which look veri
clean and white and surround by a hedg of reed and stick tightli
ti togeth insid which ran a slightli rais bench also made of
limeston the hut itself wa neatli thatch the thatch project
sever feet so as to form a cover to a narrow verandah that ran all
round it insid it wa commodi and ornament after the egyptian
style with straight and spiral line paint on with some kind of red
ochr and floor with a polish substanc certainli these hut ar
as much superior to those of the zulu as those who dwell in them ar
inferior to that fine race what the basutu gain in art and handi
thei lose in manli and gentlemanli feel
we had just laid ourselv down on the grass mat in the courtyardfor
it wa too hot to go into the hutthoroughli exhaust with our dai
work and the heat when in came two men each of them drag a fine
indigen sheep thei were accompani by makurupiji who brought us a
messag from secocoeni to the effect that he the chief sent to greet
us the great chief that he sent us also a morsel to eat lest we
should be hungri in hi hous it wa but a morselit should have been
an ox for great chief should eat much meatbut he himself wa pinch
with hunger hi belt wa drawn veri tight by the boer he wa poor
and so hi gift wa poor still he would see if tomorrow he could find
a beast that had someth besid the skin on it bone that he might
offer it to us after thi magniloqu address the poor anim were
trundl out by the other gate to have their throat cut
after get some supper and take our quinin we turn in and
slept that night in the best wai that the heat would let us rise next
morn with the vain hope of get a bath of all the discomfort
we experienc at secocoeni the scarciti and bad of the water wa
the worst bad water when you ar in a hotb of fever is a terribl
privat and so we had to go unwash with the except of have a
littl water pour over our hand out of gourd we must have present
a curiou sight at breakfast that morn befor us knelt a sturdi
kafir hold a stick in each hand on which were respect spear
a leg and a side of mutton from which we cut off great hunk with our
huntingkn and take them in our finger devour them like
beast of prei if we got a bit we did not like our mode of dispens
of it wa simpl and effect we threw it to on of the nativ
stand round us among whom wa the heirappar who promptli
gobbl it up
breakfast finish a messag came from secocoeni ask for spirit to
drink but we were not to be taken in in thi wai for we knew well that
if we sent the chief spirit we should get no busi done that dai
and we did not care to run the risk of fever by stop longer than we
could help so we sent back a messag to the effect that busi
must come first and spirit afterward the head men who brought thi
messag said that thei could perfectli understand our object as far
as secocoeni and ourselv were concern sinc we had to talk but
as thei had onli to sit still and listen there could be no possibl
object to their have someth to drink thi argument wa
ingeni but we did not see the forc of it as our stock of spirit
which we had brought more for medicin than anyth els wa veri
limit still we were oblig to promis them a tot after the
talk wa over in order to keep them civil
our messag had the desir effect for present secocoeni sent to sai
that it wa now time to talk and that hi head men would lead us
to him so we start up accompani by makurupiji swasi and
galook the gener of hi forc a fat fellow with a face exactli
like a pig the sun beat down with such tremend forc that though
we had onli threequart of a mile to walk we felt quit tire by
the time we reach the chief kraal pass through sever cattl
kraal we came to a shed under which sat the heirappar dress in
a gorgeou blanket with hi court around him leav him we enter an
inner cattl kraal where in on corner stood a larg roughlybuilt
shed under the shade of which squat over a hundr of the head men
of the tribe gather togeth by secocoeni to wit
as each chief came up to the meetingplac he would pass
befor the enclosur where secocoeni wa sit and salut
him by softli strike the hand togeth and sai
someth that sound like marema
open out of thi kraal wa the chief privat enclosur where stood
hi hut as we drew near secocoeni who had inspir such terror into
the bold burgher of the republ the chief of nine thousand warrior
the husband of sixtyfour wive the father of a hundr children rose
from the oxhid on which he wa seat under the shade of a tree and
came to the gate to meet us and a queer sight thi potent wa as
he stood there shake hand through the gate of middl ag about
fortyf year of ag rather fat with a flat nose and small
twinkl black ey he present an entir hideou and
semirepuls appear hi dress consist of a cotton blanket
over which wa thrown a tigerskin kaross and on hi head wa stuck
an enorm old white felt hat such as the boer wear and known as a
wilderbeest chaser
after we had been duli introduc he retreat to hi oxhid and we
went and squat down among the head men secocoeni took no activ
part in the proceed that follow he sat in hi enclosur and
occasion shout out some instruct to makurupiji who wa
liter hi mouth speak for him and make us of the pronoun
i dure the four hour or so that we were there secocoeni never
stop chew an intox green leaf veri much resembl that of
the pomegran of which he occasion sent us some
after the busi of the commiss had come to an end and some of our
parti start on their homeward journei we were detain by secocoeni
who wish to see us privat he sent for us to hi privat enclosur
and we sat down on hi oxhid with him and on or two head men it wa
veri curiou to see thi wili old savag shove a hand of leav
into hi mouth and give hi head a shake and then make some shrewd
remark which went straight to the bottom of whatev question wa in
hand at length we bade secocoeni goodby have promis to deliv
all hi respect messag to our chief and thoroughli weari
arriv at our own hut tire as we were we thought it would be better
to start for the fort at onc rather than risk the fever for anoth
night so we made up our mind to a long moonlight ride and saddl
up got out of secocoeni town about 330 pm have look our last
upon thi beauti fevertrap which onli want water sceneri to make
it absolut perfect halfwai up we saw the poor hors we had left
sick the dai befor ly dead with dry foam all round hi mouth
and half hi skin taken off by some pass basutu a coupl of hundr
yard farther on we found anoth dy left by the parti who had
start befor us it wa in truth a vallei of the shadow of death
luckili our hors last us back to the fort but on di there and
the other two ar dead sinc
beauti as wa the scene by dai in the light of the full moon it wa
yet more surpassingli love it wa solemn weird everi vallei becam
a mysteri deep and everi hill stone and tree shone with that cold
pale lustr which the moon alon can throw silenc reign the silenc
of the dead broken onli onc or twice by the wild whistl challeng
of on of secocoeni warrior as he came bound down the rock
to see who we were that pass the effect of the fire by the hut
perch among the rock at the entranc to the pass wa veri strang
and beauti remind on of the midnight fire of the gnome in the
fairi tale
and so we rode on hour after hour through the night till we wellnigh
fell asleep in our saddl and at length about two oclock in the
morn we reach the waggon to find the young boer fast asleep
in our bed we kick them out and after swallow some biscuit
tumbl in ourselv for the few hour rest which we so sadli need
on the follow morn thursdai two of the parti bade farewel to
our host at the fort and start on on of the quickest possibl trek
leav our companion to proce across countri to the fort establish
by presid burger or porocororo as the basutu call him at
steelport
we return to middelburg by an entir differ rout from that
by which we came leav the vallei of the olif to our right we
trek along the highveldt and thu avoid all the fever countri
roughli speak we had about 120 mile of countri to get over to reach
middelburg and we determin to do thi in three dai and two night
so as to get in on the saturdai night as we were much press for time
now accord to english idea it is no great thing to travel 120
mile in three dai but it is six dai journei in an oxwaggon over
bad countri and we were go to do it in half that time by doubl
the speed
of cours to do thi we had to trek night and dai for instanc on the
first dai we inspan at 1030 am and trek till within an hour
of sundown at sundown we inspan and with on outspan trek till
sunris outspan for two hour and on again be seventeen and
a half hour under the yoke out of the twentyfour and cover
fiftyf mile of cours on cannot do thi sort of travel for
more than two or three dai without kill the oxen as it wa toward
the end as soon as the yoke were lift off the poor beast drop
down as though thei were shot and most of them went lame anoth
great disadvantag is that on suffer veri much from want of sleep the
jolt of the springless machin as it lumber over rock a foot high
and through deep spruit or stream brought our head down with such a
fear jar on the saddlebag that we us for pillow that all sleep
wa soon knock out of them or even if we were lucki enough to be
cross a stretch of toler smooth ground there wa a swai
motion that rub on face up and down till the skin wa nearli
worn through polish the saddlebag to such an extent that we might
almost have us them for lookingglass as well as pillow
at secocoeni kraal we had engag two boi to carri our pack as far
as the fort who on their arriv were so well satisfi with the wai
in which we treat them that thei request to be allow to proce
with us these young barbarian who went respect by the name of
nojok and scowl as be the nearest approach in english to their
sisutu name were the greatest possibl sourc of amus to us
with their curiou wai i never saw such fellow to sleep it is
a posit fact that nojok us frequent to take hi rest coil up
like a boa constrictor in a box at the end of the waggon in which box
stood three iron pot with their sharp leg stick up on those leg
he peacefulli slumber when the waggon wa go over ground that
prohibit our even stop in it scowl wa not a nice boi to look
at for hi nake back wa simpli cut to piec and cover with huge
weal of which everybodi doubtless thought we were the caus on
inquir how he came to get such a tremend thrash it turn
out that these basutu have a custom of send young men of a certain
ag out in coupl each arm with a good sjambok a whip cut from
the hide of a seacow to thrash on anoth till on give in and
that it wa in on of these encount that the intellig scowl got
so lacer but as he remark with a grin my back is noth the
chief should see that of the other boi
of these two lad nojok subsequ turn out
worthless and went to the diamond field whilst scowl
becam an excel servant until he took to wear a
black coat and turn christian when he shortli afterward
develop into a drunkard and a thief
the ag of puberti
we spent on night at middelburg and next morn bid adieu to our
kind english friend start for pretoria take care to end our first
dai journei at a hous where an englishman live so as to ensur a
clean shakedown here we discov that the hors i wa ride the
sole survivor of the five we had start with had got the sick
and so we had to leav him and hire anoth thi hors by the by
recov which is the onli instanc of an anim conquer the
diseas which ha yet come under my observ we hire the new hors
from a boer who charg us exactli three time it proper price
and then preach us a sermon quit a quarter of an hour long on
hi hospit hi kind of heart and hi willing to help
stranger i must tell you that just as we were go to sleep the
night befor a stranger had come and ask for a shakedown which wa
given to him in the same room we had risen befor daybreak and my
companion wa expati to me in clear and forcibl languag on the
hypocrisi and scoundrel of thi boer when suddenli a sleepi voic
out of the dark murmur thickli i sai stranger guess you
shouldnt lose your temper guess that er boer is act after the
manner of human natur and then the owner of the voic turn over and
went to sleep again
we had over sixti mile to ride that dai and it must have been about
eight oclock at night on the sixteenth dai of our journei when
we reach pretoria and rode straight up to our camp where we were
heartili greet i am sure that some of our friend must have felt a
littl disappoint at see us arriv healthi and fat without a sign
of fever after all their melancholi predict it would not have been
human natur if thei had not when we got to the camp i call out
to masooku my zulu servant to come and take the hors next moment
i heard a rush and a scuttl in the tent like the scrimmag in a
rabbitburrow when on put in the ferret and masooku shout out in
zulu he ha come back by chaka head i swear it it is hi voic
hi own voic that call me my father my chief
and so end on of the hardest and most interest journei
imaginablea journei in which the risk onli ad to the pleasur
still i should not care to make it again at the same time of year

a zulu wardanc
in all that worldwid empir which the spirit of the english

met and dealt with befor the possibl evil of the morrow the seed of
great polit troubl were plant in the young coloni seed whose
fruit is fast ripen befor our ey
when the strong aggress hand of england ha grasp some fresh
portion of the earth surfac there is yet a spirit of justic in
her heart and head which prompt the question among the first of such
demand as to how best and most fairli to deal by the nativ of
the newlyacquir land in earlier time when steam wa not and
telegraph and special correspond were equal unknown agenc for
get at the truth of thing thi question wa more easili answer
across a width of divid ocean or contin then distant action might
be prompt and sharp on emerg and no on would be the wiser but of
late year ow to these result of civilis harsh measur have
by the mere pressur of public opinion and without consider
of their necess in the ey of the colonist been set asid as
impractic and inhuman in the case of natal most of the earli
question of possess and right were settl sword in hand by the
pioneer dutch who after a space of terribl warfar drove back the
zulu over the tugela and final took possess of the land but thei
did not hold it long the same hate invad englishman with hi new
idea and hi higher form of civilis who had caus them to quit
the old coloni the land of their birth came and drove them vi
et armi from the land of their adopt and it wa not long befor
these same english becam lord of thi red african soil from the coast
up to the drakensberg still there were difficulti for although the

remnant too of conquer aborigin tribe who had found even
chaka rule easier than that of their own chieftain swell the

which thought men fear must on dai find a sudden and violent
solut thu it come to pass that there hang low on the horizon of
south africa the dark cloud of the nativ question how and when it will
burst no man can pretend to sai but some time and in some wai burst it
must unless mean of dispers it can be found
there is now at work among the kafir popul the same motiv power
which ha rais in turn all white nation and have built them up
to a certain height ha then set to work to sap them until thei have
fallenth power of civilis hand in hand the missionari and the

will be found that in hi natur state hi vice ar larg

be honour by pagadi through them an acknowledg wa sent and we
still rode on begin the ascent of the formid stronghold on the
flat top of which wa place the chief kraal a hard and stiff climb
it wa up a bridl path with far more resembl to a staircas than a
road but if the road wa bad the sceneri and the veget were wild
and beauti in the extrem now we came to a deep kloof or cleft
in the steep mountainsid at the bottom of which half hidden by the
mass of fern and rich rank greeneri trickl a littl stream now
to an open space of rough ground cover onli with huge weatherwash
boulder a littl further on lai a kafir mealiegarden where the
tall green stalk were fairli bent to the ground by the weight of the
cornladen head and beyond that again a parklik slope of grassi
veldt and ever when we look behind us the vast undul plain
over which we had come stretch awai in it mysteri silenc till it
blend at length with the soft blue horizon
at last after much hard and steadi climb we reach the top and
stood upon a perfectli level space ten or twelv acr in extent
exactli in the centr of which wa place the chief kraal befor we
dismount we rode to the extrem western edg of the plateau to look
at on of the most perfectli love view it is possibl to imagin it
wa like come face to face with great primev natur not natur
as we civilis peopl know her smile in cornfield wave in
wellord wood but natur as she wa on the morrow of the creation
there to our left cold and grei and grand rose the great peak
fling it dark shadow far beyond it base two thousand feet and more
beneath us lai the vallei of the mooi river with the broad tranquil
stream flash silver through it midst over against us rose anoth
rang of tower hill with sudden open in their blue depth
through which could be seen the splendid distanc of a champaign
countri immedi at our feet and seem to girdl the great gaunt
peak lai a deep vallei through which the littl bushman river forc
it shine wai all around rose the great bushclad hill so green so
bright in the gloriou stream sunlight and yet so awfulli devoid of
life so solemnli silent it wa inde a sight never to be forgotten
thi wide panoram outlook with it tower hill it smile
vallei it flash stream it allpervad sunlight and it deep
sad silenc but it wa not alwai so lifeless and so still some few
year ago those hill those plain those river were teem each with
their variou creatur but a short time sinc and stand here
at eventid the travel could have seen herd of eleph cool
themselv yonder after their dai travel whilst the blackhead
whitetusk seacow rose and plung in the pool below that bushclad
hill wa the favourit haunt of drove of buffalo and eland and on
that plain swarm thousand upon thousand of springbok and of quagga
of hartebeest and of oribi all alien life must ceas befor the white
man and so these wild denizen of forest stream and plain have pass
awai never to return
turn at length from the contempl of a scene so new and so
surpris we enter the stockad of the kraal these kraal consist
of a stout outer palisad and then at some distanc from the first
a second enclosur between which the cattl ar driven at night or in
case of danger at the outer entranc we were met by the chief eldest
son a finelybuilt man who greet us with much respect and conduct
us through row of hut to the dwellingplac of the chief famili
fenc off from the rest by a hedg of tambouki grass in the centr
of these stood pagadi hut which wa larger and more fine woven and

but onli to burst out again and again with unquench enthusiasm
in order probabl to give the warrior a brief breath space
anoth song is now set up and it is marvel the accuraci and
knowledg of melodi with which the part ar sung like a glee of catch
the time be kept by a conductor who rush from rank to rank beat
time with a wand yet it is hardli like chant rather like a weird
sob melodi with tone in it which rang from the deepest bass to
the shrillest trebl it end in a long sigh and then follow a scene
a tumult a mele which hardli admit of a descript in word the
warrior engag in a mimic combat onc more thei charg retreat
conquer and ar defeat all in turn in front of them excit them

and round them again danc the children arm with mimic spear and
shield wild as seem the confus through it all even the moment
of highest excit some sort of rough order is maintain more
it would seem by mutual sound than by word of command or sens of
disciplin
even a zulu warrior must sooner or later grow weari and at length
the signal is given for the danc to end the compani ar drawn up in
order again and receiv the prais and thank of those in whose honour
thei had been call togeth to these compliment thei repli in a

rattl thi is the royal warsalut of the zulu and is but rare
to be heard on more sonor salut with voic and hand and then the
warrior disappear as thei came drop swiftli and silent over the
brow of the hill in compani in a few moment no sign or vestig
of danc or dancer remain save befor our ey the welltrodden
