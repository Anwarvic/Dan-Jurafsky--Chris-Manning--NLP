milan cathedr
sure solomon foresaw these dai when he set down that famou sai
as to the make of mani book the aphor i confess is on which
strike me through with shame whenev i chanc to be call upon to
read it aloud in the parish church on sundai inde it suggest to me
a tale which ha a moralor a parallel some month ago i tarri at
haifa a place on the coast of syria with an abomin port it wa
at or about the hour of midnight that a crowd of miser travel
of whom i wa on might have been seen cower in the wind and rain
at the gate of thi harbour there the judg and the offic bulli
and rent them caus them to fumbl with damp hand and discov
their tezkereh in inaccess pocket which thei did that the
account given in those document of their object occup past
histori and person appear might be verifi by a drowsi turk
seat in a box upon the quai not until he wa satisfi on all these
point inde would he allow them the privileg of risk death by
drown in an attempt to reach a steamer which roll outsid the
harbour
at length the ordeal wa done with and we were inform that we might
embark that is to sai we were gracious permit to leap five feet
from an unlit pierth step of which had been wash awai in the
gale of the previou night but will i am inform be repair next
seasontrust to provid to caus us to fall into a dark object
beneath believ to be a boat anoth turkish offic watch our
departur suspici though what he imagin we could be carri
out of hi barren land is beyond my guess
cook cook cook we croak in deprecatori tone as on by on we
crept past him cow and cold fear that he might invent some
pretext to detain us therefor it wa inde that we hurri to bring
to hi notic the onli name which seem to have power in syria that
famou name of the hydrahead the indispens the worldwid
cook
cook cook cook we croak
oh ye answer the exasper turk in a tone not unlik that of
a sleepi pigeon coook coook coook oh ye all right coook
alwai coook go tojerichocoook
in the same wai and with much the same feel think of the long
line of work befor me i mutter to the reader now book book
book
can he be so rude as to answer after the exampl of the haifa turk
oh ye all right boook c c the thought is too pain i
leav it
to be brief i write for variou reason thu from the era of the
bordeau pilgrim who wrote in the year 333 the veri first of those
who set on paper hi impress of the holi land to thi dai from
time to time among those who have follow in hi step some have
left behind them account of what thei saw and what befel them the
list is long there ar st sylvia and the holi paula arculfu and
st wilibad mukadasi and bernard the wise saewulf and the abbot
daniel phoc the cretan and theodor felix fabri sir john
mandevil de la brocquir and maundrelland so on down to
chateaubriand and our own time but on thing thei had in common
theyor most of themwer driven on by the same desir obedi to
a voic that call in the heart of so mani thei travel by land and
sea to look upon the place where jesu christ wa bornwher the
master of mankind hung upon hi cross at calvari
i will confess that i have a fanci to be number among their
honour compani so it mai chancethi is my hopethat when
anoth thousand year or more have gone by advanc the holi land
thu far upon it futur and the moslem ha ceas to occupi the
sacr place my name mai appear with their name thu perhap i
also mai be account a link in the chain of those who dedic some
of their uncertain dai to visit and describ that grei stretch
of mountain land which is the cradl of man hope in the dark
that draw near to everi on of us
my second reason is that i should like to sai someth about that
neglect british possess the fair island of cypru todai a
cinderella among our coloni with a littl more careand
capitalsh might again becom what she wa of old the garden of the
mediterranean a land of corn and wine and in fact as well as
figur a mine of wealth of cypru but few have written
travel rare think it worth the while to visit there so in thi
particular at the least i trust that i mai not be blame
there is further a last argument or excus which i will ventur to
us becaus it seem to me to have a veri wide applic far
wider inde than is necessari to the instanc of these humbl
page it is the fashion nowadai to sai that everyth is hacknei
that the east itself for instanc is practic exhaust that the
reader who perchanc ha never travel further than ramsgat can
have littl more to learn therefrom give us some new thing cri
the tire world as the athenian cri of old thei ask in vain on
thi side of the grave there is no new thing we must make the best of
the old materi or give up think and read and the see of
sight yet what a fallaci underli the surfac mean of these
word is not everyth new to the ey that can see and the ear
that can hear ar there not joi and wonder about us by the thousand
which be so blind and deaf we seldom seiz or valu
oh jade reader go stand in a garden as i did tonight and watch the
great cold moon creep up beyond the lattic tree while the shadow
grow befor her feet listen to the last note of the thrush that
swai on the black bough of yonder beech sing with a heart
touch by the breath of spring such a song as god alon could teach
her and there in the newfound light look down at those pale
flower or if you prefer it stand upon them thei ar onli
primros that as lord beaconsfield discov ar veri good in
salad
to drop the poeticaland the ultrapract which is worseand
take a safer middl wai i cannot for my part believ that thi old
world is so exhaust after all i think that there is still plenti to
be seen and more to be learn even at that ramsgat of which i spoke
just now therefor i will try to describ a few of the thing i saw
last winter as i saw them and to chronicl their mean as i caught
and understood them hope that some will yet be found for whom thei
mai have interest
upon a certain foggi winter morn we stood at chare cross station
en rout for itali cypru and syria vi the st gothard c
thi sure is how i should begin for it is bold to break awai from
the accept formula of book of travel consecr by decad of
public
still let me do so and befor we leav it look round the station it
is a horribl reek place heaven know on such a morn as thi
of which i write the most common of all sight to the travel also
and on of the most unnot and yet how interest in a sens
even it is majest the great arch roof a veri cave of the wind
the heavi pencil of shadow flung across it grei expans the grimi
pervad mist the lump of black smoke edg with white propel
labori upward the fierc sharp jet of steam the constant
echo of the clang nois the sens of bit forc in those
anim machin that move in and out vanish there into the wet
mist appear here in the sootstreak gloom then the popul
of thi vast unfriendli place the servant of the great engin and
those whom the engin bear on their wai to mani land thei come
thei go those multitudin form thei ar seen thei disappear
those variou face each of them if you watch domin by some
individu notegrief joi expect regret ennui even as mai
chanc
that train steam out and those who cluster round it have melt
like last night snow some it ha born awai some friend and
spectat have wave their last farewel ar depart upon their
affair now a new train arriv other crowd appear drawn from the
vast reservoir of london and with variat the scene repeat
itself thi time we take an activ part in the plai and present
steam out into the billow of black mist and ar lost behind the
curtain of the swing rain there beneath us run the inki thame
sombr mysteriouslook even and to the ey notwithstand it
creep squalorthough why thi should be so it is hard to
sayendu with a grandeur that is not the properti of mani a nobler
stream
next appear countless sordid hous the crowd monoton home
if home thei can be call for which ten of thousand of englishmen
abandon the wholesom countrysid and the pure air of heaven
becausefor those who can get ither in london the wage is higher
thei ar done with now in their place is stretch the open english
landscap wet and wretch it green field show almost grei
beneath the embrac ashen sky the tree mere black dot the road
yellow line of mud yet in it own wai it is beauti all of it as
the face of natur is ever beauti to those who love her and
know her mood can sympathis with them and catch someth of
their mean
so through these familiar thing onward to the sea
moder wa the report of the channel weather at chare cross
which as the stationmast explain mysteri might mean a good
deal in fact we find it blow a gale for the sprai drive right
over the train on to the unhappi passeng as thei splash toward the
boat quiver and livid some of them with anticipatori qualm but
the histori of a bad cross mai well be spare the boat did get out
and it wa accomplishedat a pricethat is all
if i were ask to devis a place of punish for sinner of what i
mai chanc to consid the direst decre a firstclass continent
hotel is the purgatori spot to which i would commit themfor a
centuri at a time ye and thither thei should travel onc a month
with famili in the waggonlit of a train de lux with all the
steampip turn on and yet there ar peopl who like hotel i
have known some wander even who inhabit them from choic
american too ar veri happi there strang it is that folk can be
so differ constitut rather would i dwellfor a life
choicein a cottag in the countri on a pound a week than free in
those foreign gorgeou hostelri where everi decor strike you
like a blow fed with mess such as the soul loath and quail
beneath the advanc shadow of a monstrou bill the subject is a
larg oneit should be treat fitli in a book hotel life and it
influenc on human charact would do for the titl
i think that i must have been somewhat unfortun in my experi of
continent travela kind of railwai jonah the last time that i made
thi italian journei for instanc at two minut notic my
fellowvoyag and i in the exact dead of night were drag from
our sleepingberth and on the top of the alp in the midst of the
snow of winter were transfer to an ici railwaycarriag with such
of our belong as we could grasp on ladi i rememb in her
hurri lost a valuabl sabl cloak the reason alleg for thi
perform wa that the wheel of our sleepingcar had becom heat
but the conductor inform me that the real caus wa a quarrel
between the director of two line of railwai thrice in success
it would appear and at thi veri spot had the wheel becom heat
and the travel torn halfawaken from their berth
on the present occas we met with a somewhat similar experi
leav basl in the hope and expect of reach milan that
night at lucern we were inform that the st gothard wa block by
a train which had gone off the line so in that beauti but cold and
expens town we must remain for fourandtwenti hour
onc i climb the st gothard now over thirti year ago when a
brother and i walk from fluellen to the top of the pass with the
purpos of bid farewel to anoth brother who wa travel
across it by coach upon hi wai to india in those faroff dai there
wa no railwai and the tunnel wa not even complet i recollect
littl of the trudg except that i grew footsor and that my brother
and senior by a year or two sang song to me to keep up my spirit
about halfwai up the pass we slept at some villag on the road here
the innkeep had a pretti servant whostrang entertainmenttook us
to a charnelhous attach to the church where amongst mani other
she point out a shine skull which she inform us wa that of her
own father thi skull and it polish appear i rememb well
also some other incid connect with the arriv and departur of
the coach upon the summit
of the sceneri howev i recal littl or nothingi do not think
that view have great attract for youth at ani rate thei had few
for me when i wa a soar human boi my father took me up the
rhine by boat with the hope and expect that my mind would be
improv in contempl it love and histor bank weari of
thi feast veri soon i slip down to the cabin to enjoi on more
congeni that of robinson cruso in a tauchnitz edit but some
famili traitor betrai me and protest even with tear that i
hate view i wa drag to the deck again i have paid six
thaler shout my justli indign parent as he haul me up the
steamer stair for you to studi the rhine sceneri and whether you
like it or not young man studi it you shall that waseheu
fugac labuntur anniin or about 1867
to return to the year 1900 so it came about that to all intent and
purpos the st gothard wa to me a new experi therefor i wa
the more disappoint when on steam out of lucern station we found
ourselv in the midst of a rage snowstorm so fierc and thick
inde that i began to fear that for a second time we should be
stop in our attempt to cross the alp
yet that snow had it compens for in it the observ
understood better perhap than he might otherwis have done the
vast of the panorama which lai outstretch beneath him first
all seen through that veil of fly flake appear forest of fir
grow tier abov tier upon the face of a precipic so steep that
almost it might be a titan wall then the pine vanish and ar
replac by thousand of delic birchtre hang like white hair
about some bald gigant head while beneath them roar a torrent
it water creamthick with snow these vanish also as the white
curtain grow too dens for the ey to pierc suddenli it thin and
lift and there far down below appear a toi town with a toi
woodbuilt church next an enorm gulf and in it depth a torrent
rage and alwai a sens of mountain invis inde but
overhang impend vast
now a littl hut is seen and by it a bluerob woman signalflag in
hand there heedless of the bitter wind and weather she stand like
the wife of lot stonestil and white with snow we rush past her
into mile upon mile of tunnel to pull up at last by some mountain
station where the drift lie deep
here i beheld an instanc of true polit two italian gentlemen
on old on young were engag at the us task of clear the
rail with longhandl shovel and deposit the snow in barrow for
remov present the younger of the pair give wai to some sudden
sportiv impuls shot a whole spade of snow over hi companion
head imagin how such an expect compliment would have been receiv
by the averag english navvi next morn the policecourt would
have rung with it as it wa rememb the fieri southern blood i
expect to see knive flash in the mountain air but not so the
older person mere cough shook the snow from hi grizzl lock
and with a deep bow and splendid sweep gesturepoint to the
barrow could reproof have been more gentl or more effect
beyond the tunnel to our joi the snow is much thinner mere patch
inde ly in the hollow of enorm boldshould mountain
whose steep flank ar streak with white rope of water or here and
there by the foam of some great fall in the kloof also cling lump
and line of dens mist like cloud that have sunk from heaven and
rest there down in the vallei where the railwai run begin to
appear evid of a milder climat for vine grown upon a
trelliswork of pole ar seen in plot and by the stream bank
flourish willow alder and poplar so through chang scene we
run southward into itali and welcom a softer air
i have visit mani cathedr in variou part of the world but i
cannot rememb on that struck me more than the interior of that of
milan which i now explor for the first time i sai the interior
advisedli sinc the exterior with it unnumb pinnacl and
thousand of statu doe not particularli appeal to my tast in

with mani other detail which we did not seekth nobl cruciform
design all such beauti ar familiar to mani reader and doubtless
mai be equal if not surpass elsewher as it happen howev
we found more than these or be fortun in the time and
circumst of our visit to me thei suggest more
pass the ancient door from the busi piazza where electr car
glide up and down continu like misshapen boat with bell fix in
front of them and push asid the heavi curtain of leather of a
sudden we stood in anoth world life and death could scarc be
more differ vast space veri dim for it wa four oclock on a
winter dai full of shadow and a certain majest empti column
upon column more than the ey could number and abov the
scarceseen arch roof in the far distanc of the aps someth
white about the sanctuari in fact a great veil of which i do not know
the us or symbol signific but from where we saw it first
suggest the appear of the white wing of some angel cherish
the altar of hi god then upon that altar itself twinkl spark of
light and swing high in front of it near to the tower roof
inde like some sleepless ey watch from abov anoth starri
lamp
along the vast nave down the empti aisl creep the state
measur music of the organ now quit suddenli sweet voic take up
their chant and the offer of song aris fall to rise again till
slowli it echo faint and die in the space of the dome as we draw
near through the cold and perfum gloom priest becom visibl
robe in white vestment and move to and fro about the shrine
other also or mai be thei ar acolyt pass from time to time down
through the spars congreg into the bodi of the church and there
vanish to right or left

perceiv the cloud of incens which float upward on by on past
the tall light of the candl the voic chant still more sweetli
and the music of the organ sink low as though it too were human and
knew that in such a hallow dusk and silenc it is well to whisper

ceremoni with utter of their own that ar scarc less

well how to touch our natur on it mystic side and through it reach

chapter ii
a tuscan winefarm
for gener past visitor to itali have written about florenc
therefor mind of a certain sai i propos to leav that nobl
armi unrecruit here the reader will find no account of the
architectur of it cathedr no list of the best pictur no
raptur over the loveli of giotto campanilea build by the
wai that grow veri much upon the observ or at least upon thi
observerwhos charm also vari more with the condit of the
light than ani other with which i am acquaint
still a few gener remark mai be permit for instanc on the
climat which is the common properti of everi travel and requir
no critic train to appreci what a climat it isin the month
of januaryor can be for with my common evil chanc it appear that
we happen on as thei sai in norfolk the worst winter experienc
in tuscani for mani mani year such wa ever my fortun onc i went
to iceland to fish for salmon a countri where habitu it pour
but the summer prove the driest that had been known for decad to
the ordinari travel thi would have been a satisfactori
circumst to the seeker after salmon which love a swollen river
it wa disastr other notabl instanc occur to me but i pass them
by for accord to the account of all inhabit of the place
visit these misfortun ar common to voyag mankind
within the space of a singl month we enjoi at florenc pierc
galestramontan is the local name which remind me of wind i
have felt blow straight off the pack ic in northern latitud and
noth elsefog that would have done no discredit to london in
novemb and rain whereof the tropic might be proud when the
tramontan in it glori leap and howl along the duski street of
florenc then inde doe the travel think with a repent
affect of the veri bleakest spot he know upon england eastern
shore ye even on the bitterest dai of march
is there anyth in the wind line quit so deadli cold i wonder at
least cloth cannot prevail against it for wrap yourself up till you
look like a veri falstaff and still the temperatur within is that of
a snowman to the bone it pierc to the veri marrow yet for
gener these extraordinari florentin built their hous without
fireplac i rememb note the same phenomenon in mexico citi
anoth frigid spot there inde thei swore that fire were
unwholesom here the sole concess of a vast major of the
inhabit to our common human weak consist of a scaldino
that is a littl pot full of glow wood ash which is place under
the owner chair or carri in ani conveni fashion men i
gather have not even the comfort of thi instrument of joi which
among it mani us in the event of sick or of damp sheet make
an excel warmingpan in thi case it is suspend in a kind of
enlarg wooden mousecag and plung boldli between the blanket of
all the domest institut in tuscani i think that the scaldino
is most to be desir there ar other which strike me as far from
admir
i do not wish howev to aspers thi climat against which i mai
have been more or less prejud by the preval influenza which
hit us rather hard i am instruct inde that except for certain or
uncertain outburst of cold it is realli beauti in april and mai
and even for the first part of june after which it becom too hot
for the tast and comfort of most peopl the autumn also ar said to
be fine
moreov it is onli florenc itself that is so sever dure the
first few week of my stai there i visit some countri villa on
two mountain beyond fiesol that wa the local descript and
mean veri high inde and anoth on the lower slope of the same
ancient citi which is built among the hilltop about three mile to
the northeast of florenc at each of these villa i found the most
love satisfi sunshin in which a man might bask like a lizard
till at length the chill left hi bone there i wa told that the
crown joi to the dweller in these mansion of the blest is to sit
in golden light on their verandah and for quit a consider
portion of the winter look at a damp dark cloud far below which
cloud is florenc hid in ici fog decidedli a villa at fiesol where
the mist cannot creep and becaus of it shelter posit the
tramontan ha no power is a possess to be covetedfar abov a
palac on the arno
yet when the winter voyag can forget the climat what citi ha
greater charm than florenc if to some it note seem on of
melancholi here so pervad is it presenc histori seem to press
upon the student with an actual sens of weight the numberless
church some of them still unfinish the cold state palac
the public build and piazza the statu monument and
pictur all thing distinguish and distinguish belong for
the most part as thei do to a singl centuri seem to bring the dead
time and those who shape it as it wa so near to us that in it
shadow the present is made mean and dwarf all the interven
gener that the locust ha eaten those dim quit forgotten
gener which onc in their hour furnish the daili bread of
time appear to drop awai in our garish modern wear no wed
garment of their art we find ourselv unbidden guest at thi
banquet of the pastfac to face with the ag of donatello and fra
bartolommeo and savonarola and the great medici and of the rest who
live when florenc wa in flower the effect is strang perhap it
doe not strike the italian thu or even those foreign who ar
constant resid perhap in thi case also such as seek find and
the period which gave florenc her glori is the period which
oppress us now that her son ar no longer mighti preacher
painter or architect
why is it who can explain the mysteri of the chang why when we
look into a pictur or sculptur shop on the lung arno for instanc
do we see on the on side replica of the famou and beauti
antiqu and on the other marbl inde but what marbl
simper children in frill dress young women with their nuditi
accentu by mean of bath drawer vulgarlook bust of
vulgarlook men coi creatur smirk at butterfli seat on
their nake arm or bosom and other sculptur delight but never a
work that ha a spark of the old promethean fire which elev it
student or move himat ani rate as art should move
of paint and build is it not the same where ha the geniu
flown and will it ever return i know the fashion is to decri our
modern english art and doubtless much of it is poor yet so far as my
small experi goe that art ha at ani rate in some instanc
more truth and spirit than ani other of the dai which i have found
abroad
i have said that i will not discours upon the art treasur of
florenc still i mai be permit to mention two by no mean of the
best known which perhap impress me most among them of these on
is a certain lifes annunci by donatello fashion of a
darkcolour freeston cut in high relief and set into a veri gloomi
wall of the church of santa croce it wa i believ on of the
master earli work but look at it i wonder whether he ever
fashion anyth more beauti the virgin is of a somewhat modern
type of face with rippl hair part in the middl inde i can
rememb a ladi who might have sat for a model of that statu as for
the exquisit grace of her pose and shape or that of the angel who
bend the knee to her to be understood thei must be seen descript
here is hopeless i can sai onli that in my case at ani rate thei
affect the mind as doe the sight of some perfect landscap or of a
love flower break into bloom
what imagin also is compris in the virgin pose she ha risen
from her seat and her left hand clasp the book she read her robe
ha caught upon a corner of the chair so that her mantl is strain
tight what under ordinari condit would be a woman first
instinct thought doubtless to free it with the hand that wa
disengag but noth messag ha come to herth power ha fallen
upon her and that hand is press upon the heart wherein it li
there is much els that might be said of thi true masterpiec but
let an artist sai it not on mere of art most humbl admir
the second work that struck me preemin although in a fashion
total differ is in the church of certosa di val dema it is by
francesco da sangallo and repres in white marbl the bodi of the
cardin leonardo buonafed who di in 1545 as laid out for burial
not an attract subject it mai be thought thi corps of an old
old man yet with what power and truth is it treat those full
somewhat coars featur ar instinct with the veri digniti of death
there befor us is the man as hi mourner laid him upon the bier
centuri agoeveri line of hi wrinkl face everi fold of hi
flesh that after serv him so well ha fail him now it is a
triumph of forc portraitur
the old monasteri where thi statu li and with it other almost as
perfect is a strang and love place inhabit by a few ancient
monk who under the italian law abolish the religi
establish ar i believ not allow to recruit their number
a vast pile of rambl build fortifi for defenc it stand
suprem upon a cypresscov hill it interior with the hall
chapel crypt and column galleri need not be describ inde
quaint as thei ar there is someth better hereth view from
certain window and cloister
thi prospect is quit unlik ani that i have seen in other part of
the world perhap some of the high upland of mexico with their
arid aloecloth soil go nearest to it in gener charact and
colour though that is not so veri near the prevail colournot
of tuscani in winter is grey thi tone it ow chiefli though
not altogeth to the sadhu oliv which cloth it slope and
plain broken here and there by row and clump of tall and graciou
cypress stand sometim and thu thei ar most beauti upon
a mountain ridg clearcut against the sky let the reader visit ani
good artcollect and studi the background of old florentin
pictur there he will find those same cypress so grei and
hueless though so strang charm is the scene inde that the
ey fall almost with raptur upon the vivid patch furnish by a
speci of rosytwig sallow which grow in the damper bottom
consid from abov these sallow look like no bush or tree thei
ar as littl golden cloud that have fallen from heaven to melt upon
the earth
other peculiar of that wide stretch of plain and mountainslop
ar it lifeless and silenc were thi england or even africa
bird great and small anim also would be audibl and move but
here noth not a note not a beat wing not even the white scut
of a rabbit so far as small fowl ar concern the explan is
easi thei form on of the favourit articl of florentin food in
everi eatingshop thrust through with a skewer mai be seen their
tini bodi separ from each other by squar of toast or bacon
i rememb that a man in front of the cathedr offer to sell me a
bundl of dead bird which i examin thei includ robin thrush
blackbird goldfinch and jai taken most of them with
birdlim needless to add of these bird the jai which i should
have imagin uneat were the onli on which ought to have been
kill what is the result in a long walk through wood countri in
the neighbourhood of fiesol although i kept my ey open i saw but
on small bird which wa so wild that it would not let me get near
enough to distinguish it speci just befor that rare event i had
met a sportsman with a doublebarrel gun and shortli afterward i
heard a shot probabl thi last littl bird is now no more no wonder
that brown wa anxiou to get back to england in april
oh to be in england now that april here
live as he did in a countri where scarc a songster is left to
greet the spring how thank should we be for our english bird
which add so much to the innoc happi of our livesth sparrow
alwai except and even he is welcom in a town in the garden of
the old and rambl hous where i stai in florenc live some of
these sparrow and two cherish pair of blackbird which i us
to contempl from my window also there were sundri strai cat and
sometim i wonder if those bird will ever see the autumn mai st
franci he of assisi protect them
i think that it wa on the dai of our visit to certosa where by the
wai as i have neglect to mention the monk make excel
chartreus that i becam the proud possessor of a bronz crucifix and
two hang lamphold which i discov in a small
curiosityshop these articl with a bell which i did not purchas
were part of the furnitur of the ancient chapel of a privat famili
which ha becom extinctthat of the cardin luperellipitti in
cortona thu thei found their wai into the market thei ar i
imagin sixteenth centuri work though here i mai be mistaken as i
can judg onli by such knowledg of dutch brass as i possess it is
possibl inde that the rais medallion of the father the
virgin st john and st mari magdalen at the four extrem of
the cross mai show a somewhat earlier date
my reason for mention these articl howev is becaus of the
great eleg of the shape and workmanship of the lamphold
whereof unfortun i can give no idea in word and the quaint
of the littl figur suggest of embryon angel to which ar
fix the hang chain why i ask cannot such antiqu be taken as
model for the church furnitur of todai in england ani churchwarden
or clergyman will know how extraordinarili difficult it is to procur
lamp of realli handsom and pleas design yet it rare seem
to occur to maker to copi those which were fashion in time when
even the manufactur of us brasswork wa not asham to be an
artist
in the church at heacham in norfolk mai be seen a set of hang
lamp present to it by mr nevil rolf the british consul at
napl these beauti pierc holder ar reproduc from on
that hang in the sanctuari of st mark cathedr at venic
their design is well worthi of the attent of ani who desir to
follow mr rolf excel exampl and provid an english
church with lamp that ar as servic as thei ar satisfactori
to the ey and tast
unhappili it is not in the case of churchfit onli that such a
state of affair prevail especi in thi matter of lamp a year
or two back i rememb search the entir stock of a great london
establish befor i could procur hang lamp that were even
simpl and to my fanci of a not unpleas shape when in florenc
itself i look through the content of a shop where such articl
were sold with a like result all were florid in execut and vulgar
in design
it is the same everywher in the case of brasswork thu some of my
reader mai have notic the beauti seventeenthcenturi chandeli
which still hang in certain of the church of hollandkerkkrn
thei ar calledand have notic too how pleasingli thei attract the
ey make bright point wherebi it can appreci the dimens of
those great fane yet when ga becam common in veri mani case
these kerkkrn were pull out of the church to be sold as old
brass and replac by cast gunmet bracket of the most atroci
pattern ye and thi wa done although the ancient chandeli ar
capabl of easi adapt to the us of ga as a consequ thei
ar now becom veri rare
why do not the art and craft add the educ of the tast of the
british lampmak to the list of their good work hundr of
artist complain that thei cannot make a live let them do as men of
their profess did a few centuri ago and direct their talent to
the design and manufactur at a moder price of realli beauti
articl for common us so shall their gener rise up and call
them bless perhap howeveri have heard as much suggestedth
gener as a whole prefer thing as thei ar
on dai i accept the kind invit of a gentleman who live on the
mountain about four hundr feet abov fiesol the ancient etruscan
citi that preced florenc to inspect hi vineyard where he
manufactur wine for the english market the view from thi farm is
veri fine includ as it doe florenc spread out like a map far
below and an enorm stretch of countri dot with villa
farmhous and even ancient castl that in past ag have been the
scene of sieg and sack thi expans is divid into hundr of
vineyard and oliv orchard broken here and there on the slope of
hill with patch of oak scrub which is us for firewood my host
farm is approach up a steep and constant inclin that wind through
a larg wood of cypress tree sombr but grace in appear
although in most instanc disfigur by the local habit of trim
off the bough as high as possibl thi is done under the impress
which i believ to be erron that it improv the timber at ani
rate it doe not improv it beauti
the farmstead itself is veri ancient some part of it date back to
the fourteenth centuri inde everyth here is ancient it ha a
pretti littl court or cortil with grace arch round about it
adorn in the centr with an old effigi of a lion in stone which wa
dug up somewher in the neighbourhood in front of thi court is a
well nearli a hundr feet deepprob etruscan drew their water
here look downward i could see the rippl on the face of the pool
which show where the spring flow that ha fed it for so mani
centuri the well ha thi peculiar alsothat it can be
approach for the draw of water at two distinct level the lower
have an arch entranc of it own which open on to a terrac
twenti feet or more below anoth remark featur of the hous is
a veri massiv wooden roof cover the apart now us as
sittingroom
few of these winefarm seem to be larg my host i gather is of
the common size some twenti acr under vine and oliv exclud
such portion as is still unreclaim and as yet produc noth but
scrub and strai cypress tree there is absolut no live stock on
the place beyond a hors and a cow for domest us such cart as
mai be necessari be done with hire oxwain picturesqu in
appear but slow and cumbersom in practic
as i saw it thi is the process of prepar land for vine a
suitabl area have been chosen on the steep slope of a hill face
southeast which seem to be the aspect prefer the shale soil
mix with what look to me like light loam cover with a good spit
of turf is trench to a depth of a littl over three feet first a
foot or so of broken rock is laid in the bottom of the trench for
drainag befor it is fill up with the soil and turf thi is the
most import requisit more than twenti year ago at pretoria in
the transvaal i rememb by the wai make a littl vineyard on a
veri similar soil and in a veri similar fashion onli labour be
scarc and ineffici i did not trench nearli so thoroughli
our host is now plant vine of a burgundi charact set them
as cut at a good distanc from each other these take from three
to four year to come into full bear american vine ar much
sought after in thi part of tuscani becaus of their suppos qualiti
of resist to the attack of phylloxera which dread diseas is the
blackest cloud on the horizon of the italian grapegrow these
howev seem veri difficult to obtain of good and true stock ow
appar to the exist of govern regul prohibit the
import of foreign vine tree or flower
not satisfi with the ampl drainag provid at the root and by the
natur slope of the land stone channel ar laid upon the surfac to
carri off floodwat vine it ha been prove ar veri fastidi
as to their suppli of moistur although in some season of drought
thei ar much help by irrig where thi is practic what
thei dislik more than anyth howev is stagnant water at the
root the other requisit to a success cultiv of the grape
in thi part of itali ar that the soil should be dug annual between
the row and artifici manur such as nitrat and phosphat
appli in suitabl quantiti
in the older vineyard below thi hous mani oliv tree grow among
the vine but my host inform me that thei ar unremun a
great number of these tree were destroi dure novemb in the
follow curiou fashion first fell a heavi rain which wa
succeed instantli by a sever frost that coat everi bough with
ic the tree could not bear the weight and in mani instanc
snap in two or lost their largest bough a mutil which wa
often share by the young fir i note thi destruct on my walk up
to the hous and ignorantli jump to the conclus that a tornado
had visit the district on thi farm the oliv tree which were
slain thu ar not to be replant
the actual vintag which of cours answer to our harvest occupi a
few dai onli nearli on hundr hand be emploi upon thi small
acreag so that the grape mai be got off when thei ar exactli ripe
here it is that the winefarm must show judgment and even courag
the grape ought not to be gather befor thei ar ripe but if wet
weather chanc to come on then so that thei cannot be handl thei
crack and great damag is done therefor the temptat to begin the
vintag too soon is consider
onc pluck the grape ar brought up to the hous in hire
oxwaggon there to go through the variou process of press
when thi is complet the wine is store for a while in huge vat
hold i forget how mani hundr gallon but i think about a
thousand there it remain for a certain period then it is drawn off
into other cask and kept for three year or so after which the
produc of thi particular vineyard goe to the english market my
host inform me that it is quit a mistak to suppos that the red
italian chianti will not travel and keep without undu alcohol
fortif the new wine ha thi weak not so the old that
there ar limit to it keep qualiti i can howev testifi
long ago i rememb my father produc from hi cellar some flask of
italian wine which he had import when on hi wed tour to rome
some forti year befor i never tast better vinegar
to return my host find that he can make a fair profit on hi chianti
by charg eighteen shill a dozen for it deliv in london at
least thi wa so but sinc sir michael hicksbeach ha increas the
duti on light drink wine there is a differ tale to tell as
regard the qualiti and charact of the wine although it cannot
compet with highclass french claret it is veri sound and agreeabl
to the palat abov all it is pure grapejuic and noth els
on the dai of my visit some men about four or five were emploi in
the winecav wash the flask with success rins of soda
acid and water hot and cold thi care cleans wa preparatori
to the wine be bottl for shipment realli bottl with cork not
with oil pour into the neck to exclud the air and a piec of pink
paper accord to the local custom these flask or fiaschi which
ar veri pretti and half cover with reed net cost about a
penni halfpenni apiec but i notic that a good percentag of them
break in the wash henc the term fiasco us in our sens or
to be quit accur it is deriv from the break of a full
wineflask when lift by the neck
a supplementari product of the farm is oliv oil that is ground out
by the help of an ox which walk round and round and drive a simpl
crushingmil the raw result oil is divid into three grade or
qualiti of which the second is best for lamp and the third mix
with water is us by the poor thi season the oliv harvest wa a
veri bad on consequ oil is dear
as regard the profit of such vineyard my host seem to be of
opinion that a man of energi and intellig take on year with
anoth in the absenc of phylloxera can make about ten per cent
upon the capit invest other experienc vinegrow howev
told me that thei consid thi estim too high then come the
question of the capit itself even in the case of a vineyard of
moder size i gather that the amount requir is consider the
farmer mai begin on less but if he wish to earn a live out of hi
labour it seem that he ought to be abl to command about 5000
the item of labour in the neighbourhood of florenc is not heavi the
men who ar docil and will be paid onli about eight shill
a week thei declin howev to work in wet weather nor ar thei
veri strong live as thei do upon poor and insuffici food and at
time in their fireless hovel suffer sever from the cold
the result of my investig into the prospect of the tuscan wine
industri is that on the whole i should not recommend it to young men
seek new land in which to farm the capit requir seem too
consider and the margin of profit too small moreov there is
alwai the possibl of phylloxera to be reckon with still for
those to whom consider of health or other privat reason mai
make resid in a sunni climat under a foreign flag desir who
at the same time to do not wish or cannot afford to lead an idl life
the occup would be excel to live beneath those shelter
hill to feast the ey upon that gloriou view to watch the vine
put forth their tender leav to see the tini cluster form and in
autumn to gather the rich harvest all in the glow of a gloriou
sunwhat more could be ask by the man of quiet contempl mind
who yet love not to be idl or at the least what more is he like
to get in thi hard world
chapter iii
fiesol and florenc
on bitter night at moonris i stood near to the highest point of the
mountain of fiesol and look down upon the wide vallei in whose lap
li florenc far down across line of solemn cypress and grei
grove of oliv to the vast plain beneath cold and deadcolour
appear old fiesol now that the sun had left it cold yet love
with a deathlik loveli the vagu and stretch landscap and
florenc herself that great citi how small she seem at thi
distanc of some few mile her tower palac of huge stone were
but as hut the vast dome of her cathedr as that of a villag
church the landscap domin and dwarf her the sweep circl of
black hill that mighti mirror of the arno flash in the last rai
of sunsetwhat is she compar to these the ancient etruscan
studi that view from thi veri standpoint can have felt no need of
florenc to complet the scene and were she rase now to the earth as
in the middl dai on of her ruler would have rase her she would
scarc be missedfrom here in fact it is the old stori these hill
and plain have born the yoke of man almost from the begin and
yet how faint it scar the scratch which we make on natur face
ar veri shallow and soon heal that there is noth perman about
man and hi labour is a truism which the consider of such a
scene as thi bring home those thousand lamp that ar now begin
to shine in the street and window of florenc far below will onli
burntil at dawn the light of light aris
in the winter season at the time of approach night there is
someth veri mysteri and melancholi about thi tuscan landscap
it look so coldli solemn so lifeless while on by on the star
spring out in the blue depth abov
on meet a great mani funer in florenc all of them after
nightfal perhap thi mai be account for by the influenza
prevail at the time of my stai but as a peopl the florentin
seem to me to have a strang fanci for parad their sick and dead in
public at the least i have not notic so mani of these melancholi
sight in other citi veri common is it as the visitor walk down
some narrow street to hear a measur tread behind and look round to
see the brethren of the misericordia at their work of merci these
ar thei who drawn from everi rank of societi for more than five
centuri have laid out the dead or carri the sick of florenc to
where thei might be succour their veri appear inde is omin
of death and sorrow when thei come upon the sight thu swiftli it
even shock
their robe ar black from head to foot cover the wearer all but
hi hand and feet so that noth of him can be seen save perhap
hi ey as thei glitter through the littl open in the hood six
of them go togeth three in front and three behind and between them
is the stretcher also arch over with black cloth these stretcher
ar apt to excit a somewhat morbid curios in the mind of the
passerbi watch mani of them i learn at last to know by the wai
the cross strap press upon the shoulder of the bearer and the
fashion in which these step and set their feet upon the ground
whether or no thei were empti or laden also by ani littl movement
of the cover or the lack of them whether the occup if there
should be on wa aliv or dead
from time to time the bell of the church sound the misericordia
twice for an accid thrice for a death thereon the brethren who
ar on duti rise up at onc wherev thei mai be at dinner at mass
in the theatr or at their busi don their robe and go forth
not to come back until their task whatev it prove is done as the
first pair of them set their return feet upon the threshold of the
church thei turn and give to those who follow the ancient greet
mai god reward you to receiv back the salut and you also
it is a worthi societi and their work is holi though perhap the
ambul of a london hospit would do it better also here is no
mere picturesqu surviv on dai while i stood for a few minut
near the campanil i saw three parti of them come up to the door of
the commonplac greenshutt hous which is their habit each
compani carri a stretcher though whether these were empti or
brought bodi thither to be coffin i could not tell
who ar the greatest men in the true sens that have live sinc the
dai of our lord the question is difficult if not imposs to
answer yet three name leap to my mind all of them oddli enough
connect with religion martin luther william the silent
savonarola if these star do not shine most bright among that
heavenli host i think that there ar none more lumin none at
least that burn with a purer fire none with on more immort
of the three savonarola ha alwai fascin me the most perhap
becaus a man instinct give rever to an abneg and a
nobil from which he feel that hi own weak would have lock
him we worship the crown of thorn we dare not wear savonarola wa
no paleblood monk no mere shadow of a man but on to whose ear
the world had a siren voic he could love and he could suffer and
final take up hi cross not becaus he had love and suffer not
that it grind weight might caus him to forget hi worldli smart
but for the high reason that the dai were evil and he wa call to
deni himself and cure them
sure thi man wa almost a christ without christ consol and
secret strength he onli saw through a glass darkli he onli knew in
part the spirit spoke within him but it accent were broken
imperfect and contradictori he could not hear with ani clear
often he could not understand what he heard at time he believ hi
own propheci to be the veri voic of god at time he seem to have
doubt whether thei were not mere vapour aris from hi harrow
soul the fantast smoke of hi own fervid imagin fashion to
angel shape to lead him through a gatewai of the presumptu sin
see him when the trial by fire bring him face to face with a more
furiou trialthat of hi own faith he had interpret the promis
liter he taught that faith could move mountain but had he not
meant spiritu mountain did he realli believ that the power of
heaven would alter the law of natur and keep the fire from peel
off the flesh and burn the hair and the garment of the fra
domenico he waver he hung between two opinion then faith
conquer the ordeal went on so far as it wa allow to go till
rain fell inde and put out the untrodden fire and the furiou
populac baulk of a bloodfeast turn upon their prophet
tortur and slew him by rope and flame
the home of thi man stand in florenc much as it wa in hi own dai
there is the church of san marco an uninterest build with the
pulpit from which he us to preach until hi audienc grew so great
that even the vast duomo could not hold them on dai i attend thi
duomothat is the cathedralin order to wit a process of the
white brethren except for the colour of their garment thi order is
cloth like the brethren of the misericordia and inde as i
believ perform similar merci offic outsid the gate of
florenc the occas wa a great festiv and these white brethren
preced by priest and banner carri each of them a light
taper wound about the build to gather at last in mass befor
the altar thi howev at ani rate to my ey wa not the real
sight that wa to see the thousand upon thousand of spectat
which crowd not the dome onli but the whole cathedr to it
utmost recess so dens inde that it wa difficult to move
thu thought i to myself must thi duomo have appear when it
wall rang to the echo of the voic of savonarola as he roll out
hi threat and warn upon a sin gener as he told of the
sword of god about to fallgladiu domini supra terram cito et
velocit
at first howev it wa in thi church of san marco that he
preach and sure the lesson of hi life and death will echo from
it wall down all the stream of time
yet the convent move on more here ar the cloister plant with
rose where savonarola us to walk the chapterhous with it
lifes and dread crucifix the vault refectori where he
at hi simpl food among hi brethren upstair too is the librari
with it doubl row of support arch quit plain and yet so
beauti beneath whose centr the prophet stood to administ the
sacrament to hi compani while without the furiou mob of florentin
wolv claw down the door snarl for hi blood
the dai that we visit the place wa veri cold though bright and for
thi reason or some other it wa almost unoccupi as i discov
afterward in palestin it is thu that on should studi such abod
foolish as it mai be to think it a crowd disturb their associ
and memori sometim even it seem to make them vulgar so it
happen that we went round san marco alon untroubl by guid or
tourist
the detail of the convent ar all known and volum have been
written about the paint of fra angelico mani of which ar so
beauti and yet so simpl that thei might well be vision of heaven
and it inhabit seen by some spiritu child on the wall of mani
of the cell the patient brother paint on of them and had i been
destin to dwell there i should have bless hi name when a man ha
noth els to look at save white wall a pictur in blue and red
and gold by fra angelico would fill the mind with raptur onli some
time i should have wish to move on a littl and studi the next
design
of all these narrow whitewash apart howev that onc were
the home of passion and earnest men wrestl their wai to heaven
by a thorni doubt path longforgotten dust now everi on of
them those that most fix the mind and fascin the imagin were
the abod of savonarola from the cloister without the visitor see
two littl window each a few feet squar at the end of a long
passag on the upper floor ar the apart not larger than an
ordinari dressingroom to which those window with their massiv
hang shutter give light a place to sleep and a place to sit here

flourish at the begin of the sixteenth centuryan indulg
of ten year whatev that mai mean the inner cell contain a copi
of an ancient pictur of the hang and burn of it greatest

repres in a stiff convent manner the three poor corps
hang each to it cross while the fire curl around them and littl
knot of spectat stroll about unconcernedli over the expans of

the place wa pack with thousand of excit onlook there thei

due pomp and form publicli degrad by the bishop of vason
i separ thee from the church milit and triumphant cri the
bishop exult over hi fallen foe
not from the church triumphant that is beyond thy power through
all the ag ring the answer of the dy prophet
then the yell of the mob the last dread scene of death prolong to
it uttermost the crackl of the eager pyre the flame blown out
straight like a banner by a sudden gust of roar wind the shout of
a miracl a miracl and as the wind pass and the fire get to
it destroi work again the sound of the sob of the piagnoni
and the sight of their tear which fall like dew
even thi copi paint is old now so old that the worm ar busi
as the tini hole and littl pile of white dust upon the frame
testifi i point thi out to the custodian and suggest that
paraffin skilfulli appli might prolong the life of the panel but he
onli shrug hi shoulder doubtless he thought that it would last

the outer place is that where savonarola sat and work for year
here he wrote hi note for the sermon which shook the world hi
commentari upon portion of the bibl in that tini illeg
handwrit and hi treatis against the trial by fire here hang
the robe in which he went to tortur and execut that same robe
whereof the dominican strip him here too ar kept hi hairshirt

of the atmospher which environ savonarola someth of the essenc
that inhabit him appear to occupi the place which he himself
inhabit hi breath is about those ancient wall hi prayer so
strang answer yet echo round them to some at least it is not
hard to imagin that hi ghost or it reflect still dwell there
it is a chamber to leav with a bow head and a humbl heart
the palac of the signoria is surmount by a famou and beauti
tower of wondrou architectur that soar i forget how mani hundr
feet into the air quit near to the top of thi tower the visitor
who ha the breath to climb it is shown a tini prison with a stone
seat and a singl slit to furnish it with light and air through
which look down he mai see the church of santa croce here for
some forti dai savonarola wa incarcer and henc from time to
time he wa led down to the tortur which hi frail flesh could not
bear here too whenev hi agoni were abat he wrote some of hi
last commentari what a pictur thi monk must have present as he
drag hi crush and twist limb from the tormentplac of the
bargello up those countless stair to lai hi poor head down upon the
stone while the great bell of florenc boom out the hour of the
night abov him
below in thi same palac is that gorgeou apart known as the hall
of the five hundr when some year befor savonarola urg it
enlarg to a size which would allow it to contain two thousand
citizen hi spirit of propheci did not tell him that here he would
be tri and condemn that here also he would pass some of the
latest and most holi hour of hi life in thi great chamber for the
last time or rather the last befor the last the master and hi two
discipl domenico and sylvestro met after their forti dai of
torment each of them have been assur that the other had recant
and betrai them here then savonarola prai with them counsel
them to submit to doom meekli but brave here he blest and bade them
farewel what a subject for the hand of an artist but he should be a
great artist
on dai i paid a visit to the kind and fortun possessor of a
certain most ancient and beauti villa on the lower slope of the
fiesol mountain it is a vast build with great cool room on the
wall of on of which is fresco the portrait of some on pet dog
that di hundr of year ago and beneath it a touch epitaph
the build is old inde for it histori can be trace sinc the
year nine hundr and odd and the famili from whom the present owner
bought it held the properti for over five centuri in the garden
also is the veri well us by boccaccio as the gatheringplac where
hi gai parti of gallant and their ladi fly from the pest in
florenc wile awai the heat of a summer dai by tell to each other
stori were those arcadian tale written and publish in thi year
of grace almost might thei earn their author six week in gaol and the
opportun of pose as a martyr to the zeal of puritan as it is
thei ar classic therefor like the masterpiec of queen margaret
of navarr and of rabelai thei mai circul unafraid
perhap the most beauti thing howev about thi beauti hous
is the prospect which it command for from it verandah in clear
weather can be seen a stretch of no less than thirti leagu of hill
plain and vallei on the whole i think that my most pleas
recollect of florenc and it neighbourhood is thi white and
ancient villa and the marvel landscap which li beneath and
around it for mile on mile

it is the fashion of englishmen to decri their own custom and
institut how common it is for instanc to hear our system of
railwai travel compar unfavour with that of other countri
and yet in what foreign land doe the travel meet with half the
comfort assist and civil that he find at home take the
question of luggag theoret the fashion of book mai be
perfect in practic at ani rate in itali it mean that you lose
your portmanteau under our despis habit of label on the other
hand dure mani year of travel i have never as yet lost a singl
articl again consid the muchvaunt warm of train all i can
sai is that for my part far far rather would i travel in the coldest
compart than in the heat inferno with everi airhol
hermet seal that ar fashion in the continent
corridorcarriag then the porter is there a more civil be than
the averag english porter and on more content with a veri humbl

as a specimen journei our own from florenc to rome is on to be
rememb first as usual we were pen up like sheep then by
dint of briberi as we were inform that the train would be full my
nephew wa smuggl on to the platform to secur two seat have got

railwai be to run as few train and furnish them with as few
carriag as possibl in thi on there wa not a seat to spare but
the overcrowd wa noth in the scale of discomfort compar to

torrent snow and thunder while the atmospher wa that of an
icehous no wonder that there were i forget how mani ten of
thousand of peopl down with the influenza a compani to which
present i ad on more humbl unit
but what struck me most well on or two littl thing for in the
word of herodotu of the great on out of the scanti of my
experi i do not consid it law to speak in the colosseum
opposit to the place where the caesar sat on dai of festiv and
slaughter and if i rememb right in the neighbourhood of that
occupi by the vestal is an avenu or entranc which wa call
i think the triumphant wai by it we were told the gladiat
march in befor thei cross the arena to give their famou
salut to the emperor that same salut which unconsci
perhap dai by dai from the begin to the end of time the whole
creation render to it creator those about to die salut thee
their triumphant feet must have trod upon a longvanish wooden
floor beneath thi floor ran a dark passageon can see it
todayalong which within some few minut of time the bodi of
mani of them were drag by iron hook fix in their flesh to
certain vault where thei lai till it wa conveni to be rid of
them
that struck meth contrast between the live men splendid lusti
anim the muscl swell on their limb the fire of fight in
their keen ey the har clank as thei walk and the limp
gash senseless corps which present the slave drag thenc to
the last oblivion between the on and the other wa but the thick
of a singl plank on wonder if thei understood if thei foresaw
perhap probabl not for if so thei would have been unman their
steel nerv must have turn to water thei would not have given
satisfact to their patron no as it is with us todai doubtless
each of them hope and believ that he would be the victor that he
would stand over the conquer enemi of the combat who perhap for
year had been hi own companion watch while eighti thousand
voic roar their plaudit for the movement of the vestal thumb
watchingfor thi hourfrom abov not from below
then the catacomb who that ha imagin and a heart can fail to
be move by these the smell of that hot damp air cling long about
the nostril i do not think that i shall ever be quit free of it
those narrow tortuou passag whole furlong of them and on either
side rise tier abov tier the loculi contain each a bodi or
what is left of it of some earli professor of our faith shut in
behind three or four rough tile on some there is a symbol on some
an epitaph daub in variouscolour paint on some a name i note
on particularlyflora who wa the girl flora i wonder and what
part did she plai in that huge and bless tragedi what humbl quit
forgotten part what a life also must these poor innoc have led
who crowd into those darksom burrow to worship while thei live
and to sleep when life had left them often enough by the fang of a
wild beast the sword of the gladiat or the torment of the tar
skin and the slowli burn fire truli these were faith unto
death and as we ar taught and hope their reward is not lack
think of the scene in the catacomb of san sebastian it wa i
believ dure the persecut of diocletian that a vast mob of them
were shut up here men women and littl children to starv in the
swelter heat thei still show the staircas where at length the
legionari came down the rest can be guess thy slaughter
saint o lord
a tile of on of these loculi wa loos i move it surreptiti
and thrust my taper to the hollow look in there wa the
christian as he had been entomb or rather hi bone sunk in a soft
grei dust the skull turn upon on side as a live person lai hi
head upon a pillow set with cement as is veri common so that everi
passerbi could see wa a littl glass vessel stain at the bottom
with red pigment thi said our guid show that it must be the
grave of a martyrth pigment wa hi blood tradit cling long
but thi is not so it is but the sediment of the sacrament wine
partaken of at the funer yet martyr ar enough and to spare in
these place god alon know todai which of them di by the common
sword death lift against our race which by the monstrou
fratricid hand of man also it no longer matter now that the
slayer and the slain ar at on and judgment alon is left
i will mention on thing more out of the multitud that i studi and
on onli and then farewel to rome in the sculptur galleri of the
vatican is a beauti effigi of a woman seat in a kind of low
nurs chair and suckl an infant at her breast we were told that
the model for thi statu wa agrippina personifi motherhood and
the innocentei babi at her breast becam known to the world as
nero the matricid even todai after all these centuri what a
hell jest is thi piec of carven stone
at napl the evil weather still pursu us when we woke up on the
morn after our arriv the rain wa fall in a steadi torrent
and thu it fell till night also the hotel wa bitterli cold and
colder still wa the museum where we spent the dai wrap about with
mani cloak yet it wa a happi dai although i cough and shiver
through it dark hour for never befor as i think have i seen so
mani beauti thing in on place
truli sinc in ani case their inhabit would be long dead by now
we should be grate to vesuviu which buri up herculaneum and
pompeii with all their wonder treasur of art the dweller in
those citi were in mani wai uncivilis enough for instanc the
system of housedrainag as i myself observ at pompeii wa of a
most primit and poison natur consist appar of a
cesspool under the floor of the sittingroom again their monstrou
and open licenti of which the wall and build bear such
unmistak evid their gladiatori show and other of their
custom ar scarc what we should associ with civilis as it
is understood by us in thi connect howev it must be
rememb that behind the veri thinnest veil of decent seem in
almost everi on of these respect napl is as bad todai as wa
pompeii in the year of our lord 79
yet what artist were these pompeian all the talent of the world in
our gener could not produc such statu and bronz as have been
found beneath the lava of herculaneum and the ash of pompeii
therefor it would seem that high civilis doe not favour the
product of the finest art on the other hand neither doe
savageri nor can it appear upon the earth as in the best greek
period the veri earli egyptian period the period under discuss
and that of the renaiss be account for as in the instanc of
the upris of great writer such as homer shakespear and other
in the occasion touch of the highwat mark of human intellect
by a wave of individu geniu for at such epoch geniu seem to
have been a common gift it fell like a sudden rain upon the head of
all then like the rain it ceas to be follow by a long period of
ineffect undew steril the problem is too high for me i
abandon it
napl in a domest sens is preemin remark for two
thing it beggar and it method of drive hors by mean of a
band across the nose in place of the common bit i have never
elsewher seen thi habit of har as for the beggar so far as
the travel is concern thei includ practic the entir
popul against him everi man uplift hi hand or rather he
stretch it out the right carriag fare for a cours that is
from ani on point to anoth in the town is 75 centim yet we saw
ten franc extract from a wretch american who still wa follow
with complaint and volubl abus on morn i sat at breakfast
behind a massiv window of plate glass which did not open nor wa
there ani access to the street beyond under quit a moder walk yet
dure the whole of that meal a sturdi youth stood without and beg
of me he knew that even if i wa so mind i could not commun to

in short that hi wa but labour wast and yet he beg hi

anticip to tell a stori
when we reach napl on our return from syria my nephew went ashor
to see a tradesman about some statuett which we had purchas on our
first visit that did not appear to have reach their destin
thi he did against my advic for the vessel wa onli stai two

last tug came off eight oclock wa strike on offic after
anoth ask me if my nephew wa on board i said that i could not
see or hear him and at last the captain announc firmli but
regretfulli that he had busi at marseil and must be go i
shrug my shoulder but inwardli i wa anxiou as napl is not a
place for a young man to be left strand without monei of which i
knew he had littl in hi pocket also he wore my onli ulster and i
had lent him an umbrella the time came to hoist the gangwai and i
gave him up just then through the gloom at a littl distanc from the
ship i caught sight of my ulster struggl violent and of my
umbrella wave in the air now follow an indescrib hubbub the
figur of the lost on with a neapolitan hang on to hi leg
struggl from on boat into anoth boat whenc with a wellplant
kick he neatli floor the neapolitan and breathless but triumphant
reach the companion and the deck
hi tale wa move it appear that he had been detain at the
artdeal shop and that the cabman who drove him to the quai
either by accid or veri possibl on purpos for on can never be
quit certain of the design of these men took him a long wai round
by the time he reach the embarkingplac and had finish the usual
alterc over hi fare the tug had gone leav him with
someth under fifteen minut to reach the oroya which lai a mile
or more awai somehow after be nearli torn to piec he made a
bargain and got a boat onli to discov that hi oarsmen either could
not or would not row at a speed need in the situat he coach
them in the best cambridg style and when that prove ineffect
threaten by express pantomim to cast the elder of the two men
into the deep for the bellow of the siren and the ring of the
bell on board the distant oroya were sound full of mean to hi
ear
thu encourag the rower put on the pace and arriv at length
within fifti yard of the steamer whose donkei engin were now
begin to clank upon the anchor chain but there thei stop and
open negoti for blackmail whether he would have ever got on
board the ship or now be at the bottom of napl bai or the hero of
some other unpleas predica had not an accid chanc i know
not the accid wa that while the alterc and mutual threat
proceed the boat drift against anoth boat into which with
commend agil he sprang as i have describ the italian
hang to hi leg thenc he gain the tug and from it the steamer
the offic of the ship told me that these incid ar common at
napl there it is quit customari for boatmen to bring off wretch
passeng just befor their vessel sail and refus to put them on
board until thei receiv some exorbit ransom in cypru the
travel ha no need of ani defens weapon in most part of
palestin he is not like to regret it absenc but in napl for

to what the book on the subject and their name is legion sai about
pompeii i shall attempt to add noth for mani year i desir to
see thi place and when i saw it it did not disappoint me it is
wonder the hous as thei were onli without their roofsveri
small hous for the most part the narrow street down which in time
of storm the water ran with the rais steppingston across them
the wear of the chariot wheel upon the pave of the children feet
at the door of schoolhous of the merchant feet at the entranc

no i think it is best to slip awai alon as i did and seat upon
some stone or wall in the soft shine of the sunlight to let the

yet why should thi place move us so much there ar score of dead

in napl men learn in the english tongu write work on pompeii to

we purchas for half a franc at the railwai station it is infinit
more entertain than most guidebook here ar a few extract
first of all our author is histor and tell us it is mention
by plini a m erinniu duumvir a pompean who wa thunder at
pompeii on wonder whether by thi the author mean that the
duumvir wa applaud at a theatr or that he came in sudden and
unexpect contact with the electr current if so hi fate wa
scarc so bad as that of drusu son of claudiu
he wa in pompeii and took hi pleasur to throw some pear in the

perhap the fact that neptun on foot is said to be lean upon her
shoulder mai assist the student
i will pass over the account of a xystu adorn with portico
which protect it from the ardour of the sun although curious
enough in on of the column is the auguri that wa made to a girl
that she mai sneez that is pleasingli after thi no wonder that
mani find the custom and manner of the ancient curiou and hard to
understand but to proce here is an extract in a style which mai be
commend to the notic of art critic it ha all the necessari
obscur and can scarc fail to impress the unlearn a bronz is

if it involv noth incorrect i confess that i should much like to

there is howev inform as well as amus in these page

enabl to identifi the tree with it leav and fruit as a varieti of
lauri nobili whereof the berri do not ripen until late autumn
as these particular berri were quit ripe when the ash cover
them pompeii it is clear must have perish in the winter month
i will confess that i leav thi place with a deep profession grudg
against that admir romanc the late lord lytton who is there of
our trade that would not like to write a novel about pompeii but
lytton bar the wai not that it would be difficult to find anoth
and quit differ plot it is hi titl which presag failur to

would not have matter but everi on ha heard of the novel name

even possibl that he might becom involv in correspond on the

chapter v
napl to larnaca
the morn of our departur from napl came and we depart thi
time veri earli long befor the saffrontint dawn as i rememb
when a boi at school i us to translat the homer phrase had
touch the red pillar of smoke abov vesuviu i wa up and do my
experienc best to arous my companion by arrang the electr
light in such an artist fashion that their unveil and
concentr rai struck full upon hi slumbercurtain ey but
he is an excel sleeper and the effort wa a failur therefor
stronger measur had to be found
at length we were off the extrem earli of the hour save me
someth consider in the matter of hotel tip by the time we
reach the station howev everi italian connect with the place
wa wideawak and quit readi to receiv the largess of the nobl
foreign i think that i had to fee about ten men at that station at
least eight of them for do noth gratuiti were dispens to
the busconductor who introduc us to a porter to the porter who led
us three yard to the ticket offic to an offici who inspect the
ticket after we had taken them to two other offici who show us
respect the platform from which the train for brindisi start
and the place where the luggag must be book to a superior person
who announc that he would see the luggag properli book and to
variou other inferior person each of whom prepar to carri some
small articl to the platform then be call upon suddenli to
decid and veri much afraid that the said small articl would vanish
in transit i determin upon the spur of the moment to accompani them
to the carriag leav my nephew to attend to the registr of
the heavier baggag
even in that crowd tumultu moment i had it is true my doubt of
the wisdom of thi arrang but rememb that on the last
occas when he perform thi import offic the intellig
bookingclerk had manag to reliev my companion of half a napoleon
by the simpl process of give chang to the amount of twenti
centim instead of ten franc twenti centim i wa sure that
experi would have made him veri veri cautiou present he
arriv radiant have accomplish all decent and in order at the
moder expens of anoth few franc of tip
have you got the luggageticket i ask with sombr suspicion
rather he answer do you suppos that i am green enough to come
without it and he show me the outsid of a dirti piec of paper
the outsid rememb not the insid for therebi hang a veri
pain move tale
well we start thi time in great comfort sinc except for an
italian sportsman arrai in quaint attir we had the carriag to
ourselv we steam past pompeii and sorrento thenc for hour
climb over huge mountain rang cover with snow sometim almost
to the level of the railwai line after these came vast stretch of
plain then in the afternoon we travel for mani mile along the
seashor a veri lone strand fring with pine blown by the
preval wind to curiou horizont shape as though a garden
had trim them thu for year ultim onc more we head inland
across the foot of itali and at last after a journei of about
thirteen hour to my great relief for i fear lest anoth train
off the line might make us lose our boat ran into brindisi
here to our joi the local cook wa in attend who put us into a
cab strictli charg us to pai noth to nobodi he announc
further that he would follow present to the mail steamer isi with
the heavi baggag for which he took the ticket
we reach the isi a narrow rakishlook boat found our cabin
and began to arrang thing while we were get rid of the dust of
our long journei i heard a voic outsid the voic of cook though
strang chang and agit
mr haggard said the voic mr rider haggard
ye i answer what the matter iv paid for the passag at
the offic
it isnt the passag it your luggag he repli through the
door it gone
i sank upon my berth gone i said feebli gone where
to reggio repli the mourn voic reggio on the other side of
itali where you book it to
it wa book to brindisi i shout
oh no it wasnt wail the voic it wa book to reggio here
the ticket
do you hear that i said to my nephew who with hi drip head
lift from the basin wa stare at vacanc as though he had seen a
ghost do you hear that he sai you book the luggag to reggio
i didnt he gasp i gave them the ticket for brindisi
a horribl thought struck me did you examin the voucher i ask
then almost with tear he confess that he had overlook thi
formal
my friend i went on do you understand what you have done ha it
occur to you that thi exceedingli thick and uncomfort brown
suit with three flannel shirt a leather medicinecas and some
wrap and sundri ar all that we possess to travel with to cypru
where such is the hospit natur of the inhabit we shall
probabl be ask out to dinner everi night
weve got some cigarett and a revolv and you can have my
dinnerjacket it is in the littl bag he answer with feebl
inconsequ
i took the dinnerjacket at onc it wa sever size too small for
me but better than noth then i express my feel in languag
as temper as i could command consid the circumst it wa
i think wonderfulli temper
at thi junctur the voic of the patient and most excel
repres of the worldwid majesti of cook spoke as though in
reveri through the door
it is a strang thing he said these sad accid alwai happen
to you gentlemen with doubl name the last time it wa to the great
artist gentlemanhow did he call himself ah i have it
mrmrmelton prior he went on with noth quit noth hi
luggag too travel to reggio
enough let oblivion take that dread hour but the odd thing is
that thi is the second time in my life that the said sad accid
ha happen to me onc befor bound to the east did i arriv upon
the mailsteam at brindisi onli to find that by some petti capric
of the italian railwai offici my portmanteau were at milan or
elsewher and that i must travel to egypt and sojourn there in what i
stood up in plu the content of a handbag i rememb that on
thi occas my suffer were somewhat sooth by the melancholi
state of an australian famili who found themselv doom to voyag
to sydnei with an outfit that would not have cut up into an infant
layett their luggag also had gone to reggio
as a matter of curios i should like to know why the italian plai
these trick with the belong of travel as is their common and
undoubt habit to take the present case it is true that my nephew
neglect to studi the scrawl upon the voucher but realli he wa not
to blame for he gave the clerk the ticket for brindisi by which
that functionari wa bound to regist the luggag moreov everi
offici in the station knew that we were go to brindisia fact
upon the strength of which mani of them under thi pretext or that
had manag to extract someth from my pocket yet quit calmli
although there wa no press of busi for we were almost the onli
passeng thei sent the luggag to reggio my own belief is that
sometim thi kind of thing is done as a bad practic joke or
possibl to annoi the foreign within their gate and sometim for
the purpos of pillag if thi be so the effort is emin
success especi when the unfortun victim ha to catch a mail
for the east and must leav hi effect to take their chanc
the isi is on of the swift boat which carri the mail from
brindisi to port said the bag leav london at nine on fridai night
by seven or eight on sundai night thei should be at brindisi and by
wednesdai night or thursdai morn at port said where the big boat
await them
it is veri curiou to see these bag come on board somebodi announc
that the mail is in and an offic take hi station opposit the
gangwai at a littl tabl on which li a great line and print
form while anoth offic stand by the gangwai itself
quartermast and sailor also station themselv at conveni spot
between it and the mailroom present there is a rumbl and a
cover van drawn by a wretchedlook hors appear in the strong
ring of electr light upon the quai attend it ar an
extraordinari collect of ragamuffin of whom the us now becom
appar the van is unlock by some on in charg and the first
ragamuffin is given a sack and a tallystick up the gangwai he trot
deliv the tallystick to the quartermast at it head who call
out the destin of each bag to the offic at the tabl who in
hi turn check and enter it upon the sheet that carrier trot awai
to the right toward the mailroom where he deliv hi bag and
descend by a second gangwai to the quai for anoth
meanwhil hi companion ar follow him like a stream of ant each
with a sack of letter on hi shoulder and a tallystick in hi hand
when the tallystick come to the number of ten thei ar place in
the section of a box that stand on the deck at the feet of the
quartermast a hundr tallystick exactli fill thi box which is
then replac by anoth empti box thu an addit check is kept
upon the number of the bag
now that van is empti and anoth arriv and so on and on for hour
till at last all the mail is safe aboard check and sort i
believ that on thi particular sundai night the count amount to
someth over two thousand bag which is not veri heavi on of the
offic told me that the letter c in which great britain sent
her last christma wish to the east fill nearli four thousand
bag as mai be imagin the introduct of the penni imperi post
is not like to lessen these total
befor the mail wa all on board we were fast asleep wake up the
next morn to find the isi tear at about eighteen knot she
can run twentythre through a stormi sea and beneath a wet and
sunless sky by middai our cours wa take us through the beauti
island of the greek archipelago to some of which we pass quit
close here it wa that we found most reason to mourn the lack of
sunlight which in thi drip weather caus even those green
ionian slope to look cold and grei amongst other place we saw that
leucadian crag whenc the greek poetess sappho leapt into the sea
studi the spot i came to the conclus that her nerv must have
been almost as remark as her geniu women veri rare commit
suicid by jump off a great height especi into water by the

museum that wa discov at pompeii or herculaneum i forget which
seem to suggest tradit describ her as small and dark so
perhap the head is a fanci portrait by some great artist of a later
ag so real and so full of life and intellig is it howev that
whoever wa it model must have been both a love and a clever woman
inde geniu seem to sit upon that brow of bronz and to look from

leav brindisi late on sundai night earli on the wednesdai morn
we sight the low shore of egypt by eight we were steam past the
wellrememb breakwat at port said veri empti now on account of
the war and the coal famin and in anoth halfhour had cast anchor
alongsid the great liner which wa readi to receiv our mail
onc i spent three or four dai in port said wait for my steamer
and mai claim therefor to know it fairli well of all the place i
have visit dure mani travel i can recal but on that strike me
as more dreari it is a feverstricken hole name frontera at the
mouth of the usumacinto river in tabasco that can boast the largest
and fiercest mosquito in the whole world
howev on thi occas we were destin to see but littl of port
said sinc the vessel that wa to take us on to cypru name the
flora would sail as soon as we had tranship her mail
accordingli bid farewel to the isi and her kind command we
took a boat and row across to the flora a small and uglylook
vessel paint black and belong to the austrianlloyd on board of
her i found no on who could speak ani tongu i knew and it wa with
some difficulti that at last by the help of the steward assist
who understood a littl french i wa abl to explain that we wish
to proce to larnaca
at the time it struck me as so odd that the english govern mail
should be carri in a vessel thu distinctli foreign that afterward
in cypru i inquir into the reason it seem that the coloni
offic or rather the treasuri ar respons the austrianlloyd
line be in the receipt of a subsidi from their govern were
abl to make a lower tender for the transport of mail than anoth
line own by a british compani so notwithstand the manifest
inconveni of emploi an alien bottom for thi import
purpos which in certain polit condit might easili prove
danger the home author decre that the contract should go to
the foreign perhap thei thought that the sacr principl of free
trade or rather of subsidis foreign competit ought to prevail
even in the matter of the convey of her majesti mail
anoth thing becam evid that cypru is not a place of popular
resort sinc my nephew and i were the onli firstclass passeng in
the ship unless he be a govern offici or some friend or
connect of on of the veri few british resid it is not often
i imagin that the flora take a travel to the island still she
provid for them by print a set of rule in english and hang
them on the companion thei cover much ground in them even polit
find it place sinc the reader is remind that passeng be
person of educ will pai a due regard to the fair sex
reflect howev seem to have suggest that thi axiom might
meet with too liber a render at ani rate farther down we ar
inform with grave sincer that gentlemen ar not allow to enter
the cabin of the ladi
after the dull weather we had experienc between itali and egypt the
twentyfour hour run of our lone voyag to larnaca wa veri
pleasant for the sun shone brightli the wind did not blow and the
sea wa blue as onli the mediterranean in it best mood know how to
be when we got up next morningw were provid each of us with a
whole fourberth cabin but the flora doe not boast a bathit wa
to find that cypru wa alreadi in sight a long grei land with
occasion mountain appear here and there
onward we steam watch a singl whitesail bark that slid
toward us across the azur sea like some dove on outstretch wing
till at length we cast anchor in the roadstead off the littl port of
larnaca a pretti town ly along the seashor some mile awai and
to our left as we face it rise the mountain of the holi crossi
think that it is or us to be call oro stavero by the greek
and by the latin mont croce at ani rate in the time of pocock
felix fabri the german monk who made two pilgrimag to palestin in
or about the year 1480 tell how he visit thi monasteri and saw
it relic it will be rememb that st helena the mother of
constantin the great who when an old woman journei to the holi
land in 325 of our era wa so fortun as to discov beneath the
alleg site of the holi sepulchr the verit cross of our lord
togeth with that of on or both of the thiev who suffer with
him but of thi more hereaft the cross of the good thief who why
i know not ha been name dysma she is said to have brought to
cypru and establish upon thi mountain whether anyth of it
remain there now i cannot sai as i made no visit to the place either
on thi occas or on a former journei in the island some fourteen
year ago thi is what old felix sai about it i quot here and
elsewher from the most excel and scholarli translat of hi
write by mr aubrei stewart ma which is unfortun
practic inaccess to most reader as it can onli be obtain
as part of the librari of the palestin pilgrim text societi at a
minimum of ten guinea
sheie st helenabrought her own cross that which had been
dysma entir from jerusalem to thi mount and here she built a
great convent for monk and a church within which she place thi
cross as an exceedingli holi relic she order a chamber or
closet to be built in the wall over against the altar and place
the cross within it and there it stand unmov even to thi dai
albeit the monasteri itself ha long sinc been overthrown even
to the ground by the turk and saracen and the monk of the
order of st benedict who onc dwelt therein have been scatter
the posit and arrang of thi cross in it place is
wonder the cross stand in a blind window and both it arm
ar let into hole made in the wall and it foot is let into a
hole made in the floor but the hole which contain the arm of
the cross and the foot of the cross ar larg out of all
proport and the cross nowher touch the wall but is free
and clear from contact with the wall on everi side the miracl
which is nois abroad about the cross is that it hang in the air
without ani fasten and withal stand as firm as though it were
fix with the strongest nail or built into the wall which
nevertheless it is not becaus all the three hole ar veri
great so that a man can put hi hand into them and perceiv by
touch that there is no fasten there nor yet at the back or at
the head of the cross i might inde have search thi thing
more narrowli than i did but i fear god and had no right to do
that which i had forbidden other to do i climb thi mount to
show honour to the cross not to try whether there wa a miracl
or not or to tempt god that thi cross mai be more worthi of
rever thei have join to it a piec of the true cross of
christ
felix fabri wa easili satisfi as a mediaev monk should be so
much for the cross of dysma
soon we were row ashor in the govern boat a distanc of
threequart of a mile or so for larnaca is not a harbour but an
open roadsteadther ar now no harbour worthi of the name in
cypru land at the pier we were at onc conduct to the
customhous and explain that we had noth to declar
but have you a revolv ask the offic
i answer that i had
then i must troubl you to hand it over he repli i will give
you a receipt for it and you can claim it when you leav the island
i look what i felt astonish but obei on inquiri it appear
that the cypru govern ha recent pass some legisl as to
the import of firearm it would seem that murder had been
somewhat frequent in the island mostli carri out by shoot henc
the law whether it wa intend to prevent respect travel who
purpos journei in the mountain district from carri a pistol
for their own protect is anoth matter doubtless in fact it wa
not but in cypru thei have a great respect for the letter of the
law and therefor put thi somewhat unnecessari queri for instanc
thei have anoth regulationaim i suppos at the exclus of
phylloxeraagainst the import of seed or plant which ha been
known to work in an unforeseen manner thu a year or two ago a
foreign royalti i think it wa the princ of napl visit the
island wear a carnat in hi buttonhol hi royal high must
have been somewhat amaz when a customhous offici leant forward
and gentli but firmli remov the contraband flower
i am told that thi stori is quit true but it mai be onli a local
satir upon the kindli provid of a patriarch govern
it is right to add howev that there is not the slightest need for
a travel of the ordinari stamp to carri ani defens weapon in
cypru sinc the english occup of the island at ani rate now
some twenti year ago no place can be more safe in the wildest part
of it he who behav himself ha noth to fear from the nativ a
kindli gentleheart race turk or christian although as i have
said not avers to murder each other upon occas but of thi
also more hereaft
have deliv up the weapon of war and been given an elabor
receipt for the same we proceed to our hotel accompani by a
motlei collect of variou blood and colour each of them bear a
small piec of our exigu belong whereof the bulk it will be
rememb had travel to reggio these folk howev ar not
exorbit in their demand and do not grumbl or ask for more
tourist have not come to cypru to spoil it i never heard of an
american even set foot on the island therefor a shill here
goe as far as five elsewher
the hotel at larnaca is now i believ the onli on in cypru it
stand within a few feet of the shoresaf enough for the sea is
tidelessi comfort with larg cool room and absurdli cheap
i griev to add that it proprietor cannot make it pai no travel
visit thi love and most interest isl in ancient dai the
garden of the whole mediterranean therefor there ar no hotel onc
there wa on at limasol but it fail and convert itself into a
hospit he who would journei here must either reli upon tent which
ar a poor shelter befor the month of april or upon the kind and
freeli offer hospit of the govern offici natur thi
lack of accommod frighten awai tourist which for mani reason
in a poor countri like cypru is a vast piti yet until the tourist
come it is idl to expect that conveni for hi recept will be
provid so thi matter stand
where larnaca now li wa onc the ancient citium of which the marsh
near at hand is believ to have been the harbour quit half of the
present town inde is said to be built upon the necropoli of
citium whenc come it name larnaca deriv it is suppos from
larnax an urn or a sepulchr the town is divid into two part
larnaca proper and the marina along the seashor which is report to
have been recov within the last few centuri from the bed of the
ocean
after luncheon we went to a hous whose owner deal occasion in
curios of these and all antiqu inde the export is
forbidden except to the british museum privat dig have been
put a stop to in the island as it inhabit aver in the especi
interest of that institut here we saw a few nice thing but the
price ask wa imposs 12 be demand for a set of littl
glass vase which i should have valu at 40 so we left the place
richer onli by an egyptian or phoenician spearhead of cyprian copper
a veri excel specimen and walk to the upper town about a mile
awai to take tea with mr cobham the commission
mr cobham live in a beauti hous which he ha purchas for
gener it had been the abod of the british consul at larnaca
but wa abandon by them mani year ago here in a nobl room he ha
hi uniqu collect of ancient book written by travel dure
the last five or six centuri and other deal with or touch

author ha compil the work known as excerpta cypria which
consist of translat from their page a book invalu to

fortun in be abl to purchas a set of the sheet at an advanc

set upon a wall of the saloon in thi hous and although newli
paint date from a centuri and a half or more ago is a fine
carv exampl of the royal arm of england thi veri coat as mr
cobham ha ascertain us to stand over the door of the old
british consul dure the tenanc of hi hous by the consul when
thei left it wa taken down and vanish but within the last few
year he found it in a stabl in larnaca whenc the carv wa
rescu repaint by some craftsmen on board an english manofwar
which visit cypru and after a hundr year or so of absenc
return in triumph to it old home
cypru is fortun in possess in mr cobham an offici who take
so deep an interest in her histori and spare no expens or pain in
attempt it record on the occas of my visit he spoke to me veri
sadli of the vandal which the author threaten to commit by the
throw down of the seaward wall curtainwal i think it is call
of the ancient fortifi citi of famagusta in order princip
that the stone and area mai be made us of for the purpos of the
railwai which it is propos to construct between famagusta and
nicosia of thi suggest but as yet happili unaccomplish crime i
shall have someth to sai on a later page
chapter vi
colossi
on the dai follow that of our arriv in cypru the flora
reappear from famagusta and about noon we went on board of her to
proce to limasol some forti or fifti mile awai where we were
engag to stai a week or ten dai the travel inde is lucki when
he can find a chanc of make thi journei in the cours of an
afternoon by boat instead of spend from ten to fifteen hour to
cover it in a carriag although cypru in it total area is not much
if ani larger than the two counti of norfolk and suffolk
locomot is still difficult ow to the impass natur of the
wai and the steep and frequenc of the mountain when i visit
it fourteen or fifteen year ago there were no road to speak of in
the island except on of a veri indiffer charact between larnaca
and nicosia the turk it former master never seem to make a road
thei onli destroi ani that mai exist now in thi respect matter ar
much improv the english govern out of the piti sum left at
it command after the extract from the coloni of everi possibl
farth toward the payment of the turkish tribut ha by slow
degre construct excel road between all the princip town
with bridg over the bed of the mountain torrent but as yet in the
countri district noth of the sort ha been attempt
with us were embark a number of lamb littl thing no more than a
week or two old bought i suppos for the provis of the ship
at thi season of the year everybodi in cypru live upon lamb it wa
melancholi to see the tini creatur their leg ti togeth heap
on upon anoth in the bottom of larg basket whenc bleat
piteous for their mother thei were hand up and thrown upon the
deck a more satisfactori sight to my mind were on or two cane creel
half fill with beauti brownplumag woodcock shot or snare by
nativ sportsmen upon the mountain slope
on board the steamer a fellowpasseng to limasol whither he wa
travel to negoti for the land upon which to establish a
botan garden wa mr gennadiu the director of agricultur for
the island he told me what i had alreadi observ at larnacathat
the orang and citron tree in cypru which on the occas of my
former visit were beauti to behold ar todai in danger of
absolut destruct ow to the ravag of a horribl black scale
which foul and disfigur fruit and leav alik avnidia coceinea
or avnidia orantii
for the last dozen year or so thi blight ha been increasingli
preval the mandarin varieti of fruit alon show ani power of
resist it attack the proper wai to treat the pest is by a number
of sprai with a mixtur of from twenti to twentyf per cent of
soft soap to eighti or seventyf per cent of warm water a
dress thu prepar destroi the scale by effect a chemic
union of the alkali of the soap with the fatti matter in the organ
of the parasit or fail thi stifl it by glaze it over and
exclud the air necessari to it exist mr gennadiu believ
that if thi treatment could be univers adopt scale would
disappear from cypru within a few year
but here come the difficulti for three centuri the cypriot ha
been accustom to turkish rule with it great pervad principl of
kismet if it pleas allah to destroi the orangetre in the case
of the christian peasant read god so let it be he sai and shrug
hi shoulder who am i that i should interfer with the will of
heaven by syring which be translat into anglosaxon mean i
cant be bother to take the troubl if the director of agricultur
in person or by proxi would appear three or four time a year in the
suffer garden with the wash readi made and a squirt and proce to
appli it the said suffer would look on and smoke make no
object beyond thi he will rare go
therefor unless the blight tire of attack it begin to look as
though the orang is doom in cypru thi is a piti as that fruit
doe veri well there and the mildew which threaten it at on time
wa taken at it commenc and conquer by mean of powder
sulphur puf about the tree with bellow govern distribut
the sulphur at cost price
about three hour after leav larnaca the vessel pass a slope
sward cloth with young corn and carobtre that back by lofti
peak of the trooido rang run from a hilltop to the lip of the
ocean here onc stood amathu a great citi of immemori antiqu
which flourish down to roman time if not later and ultim it
is said wa destroi by an earthquak now all that is left of it
ar acr of tumbl stone and a broken fragment of fortress whether
ancient or mediaev i cannot sai against the wall of which the sea
wash it is told that here or at some later town built upon the
same site richard coeurdelion land when he took cypru from the
emperor isaac comnenu
wonder inde is it for us the children of thi pass hour to
look at that grei timeworn coast and as we glide by to reflect upon
the ship and men that it ha seen who from centuri to centuri came
up out of the deep sea to shape it fortun for a while who were the
first no on know but veri earli the fleet of egypt were here
then follow the phoenician those english of the ancient world as
thei have been call who like eagl to the carcas gather
themselv wherev were mine to be work or monei to be made thei
have left mani tomb behind them and in the tomb work of art some
of them excel enough thu befor me as i write stand a bronz
bull made by phoenician hand from cyprian copper a wellmodel
anim full of spirit with a tail that wag pleasingli upon a ball
joint
after the phoenician or with them perhap were greek of the
mycenian period their tomb also celebr a glori that is depart
as the british museum can bear wit next to the greek the persian
then the satrap of alexand the great then the ptolemi then
gallei that bore the roman ensign which flew for mani gener
then the byzantin emperorsthes for seven centuri
after thi a new flag appear the lion of england flaunt from the
ship of war of richard the first he took the place and sold it to
gui de lusignan king of jerusalem so call whose descend rule
here for three centuri till at length the island pass into the
hand of the venetian these onli held it eighti year and after
them came the most terribl fleet the cyprian sea ha seen that which
flew the crescent for three centuri cypru groan and wither
under the dread rule of the turk till at last a few gentlemen
arriv in a mailsteam and for the second time in the histori of
the island ran up the flag of britain how long will it float there i
wonder
it wa veri interest to watch the beauti gull that follow the
vessel off thi coast the wind blow against them make not the
slightest differ to the perfect eas of their motion so near did
thei hang that i could see their quick beadi ey glanc here and
there and the strong bill of a light pink hue from time to time as
i watch on of them would catch sight of someth eatabl in the
water then down he went and suddenli from the feather of hi
underpart out shot hi claw also pinkcolour just as though he
were settl upon a tree or rock why i wonder doe a gull do thi
when about to meet the water to break hi fall perhap at least i
can suggest no other reason unless in the dim past hi progenitor
were wont to settl upon tree and he is still unabl to shake off an
hereditari habit
at length on the low mountainhedg coastlin appear the white
hous minaret and scatter palm of limasol with it jetti
stretch out into the blue water the town look somewhat grown
otherwis it aspect seem much the same as when first i saw it mani
year ago
so we land and after more customhous formal march through
the crowd street of the littl town preced by stalwart cypriot
bear our belong to dine in borrow garment with the kind
friend who were await us upon the pier
our first occup on the follow morn wa to retain the
servic of three mule and their coalblack mulet doubtless the
offspr of slave import in the turkish dai known to us
thenceforth by a corrupt of hi nativ name or design which we
crystallis into cabbag for a sum of about thirti shill a
week thi excel and intellig person place himself and hi
anim at our dispos to go whither we would and when we would
our first expedit wa to a massiv tower or rather keep call
colossi which stand at a distanc of about six mile from limasol
in the midst of veri fertil field upon the papho road off we went
my nephew and myself ride our hire mule and the rest of the parti
upon their smart poni which in cypru ar veri good and cheap to
bui and feed
i have now had consider experi of the mule as an anim to
ride and i confess that i hate him he ha advantag no doubt over
rough ground in the cours of an eight or ten hour dai he will cover
as great a distanc as a hors and in the cours of a week or less he
will wear most hors down also he will live somehow where the hors
would starv but what a brute he is to begin with hi forequart
ar invari weak and feel weaker than thei ar the cypriot know
thi and ride him on a nativ saddl a kind of thick pad quilt so
crupper that he is abl to sit far back almost on the anim tail
inde as doubtless for the same reason the costermong ride a
donkei to the stranger until he grow accustom to it thi saddl
is most uncomfort but old resid in the island gener
prefer to us it upon a long journei also it is danger to the
uniniti sinc the stirrup ar veri short not be fix thei
slide from side to side suddenli lengthen themselv let us sai to
the right with ani unguard movement which will produc a
proportion curtail on the left and the unexpect consequ
that the travel find himself face downward on the ground with a
european saddl thi particular accid cannot happen also it is
more comfort for a short journei as a setoff to thi advantag
howev the rider weight come upon that portion of hi steed which
is least abl to support it name the wither the result is that
the mule especi if push out of it customari ambl sometim
fall as though it were shot propel him over it head
it is a mistak to suppos also that these creatur ar alwai
surefoot mani of them stumbl abomin although thei do not
often actual fall never shall i forget my first mulerid in cypru
in the dai when there were no road it wa from nicosia to kyrenia
a distanc of about sixteen mile over a mountain path the mulet
into whose charg i wa given wa a huge man weigh at least
eighteen stone and i thought to myself that where thi monster could
go certainli i could follow
in thi i wa right i did follow but at a veri consider
distanc mr mulet perch himself upon hi anim doubtless on
of the best in the island look in hi long robe for all the world
like a gigant and halffil sack and off we ambl scarc were
we clear of the town when my mule unaccustom i suppos to the
weight upon hi wither and the european saddl began to stumbl i
do not exagger when i sai that he stumbl all the wai to kyrenia
keep me absolut damp with apprehens of sudden dive on to my
head down precipit and unpleas place meanwhil mr mulet
veri possibl anticip my difficulti had been care to place
about five hundr yard between us a distanc which he maintain
throughout the journei i yell for assistancein fact i wish to
persuad him to exchang mulesbut either he would not or he could
not hear moreov he had no knowledg of my tongu or i of hi so
we accomplish that veri disagre journei
onc howev i made on much more danger thi time over the
rare travel mountain of chiapa in mexico my companion i
rememb had excel mulesthei live in the countri that given
to me as the lighter weight wa weak and poor with no foreleg worth
mention we scrambl up the mountain somehow but when it came to
descend the fun began a road in tabasco then at ani rate wa
made of three compon part first a deep and precipit ditch
worn out by the feet of gener of anim cover at the bottom
with from six inch to a foot of red butter or clai quit as greasi
as butter down which on slowli slither secondli stretch
sometim mile in length of swamp land where the path consist of
littl ridg of hard clai about two feet apart the space between
each ridg into which the mule must step fill with some three feet
of liquid and tenaci mud that often reach to the saddleflap
thirdli when the swamp were pass great tract of the most grizzli
precipic which to my tast were worst of all along these steep
the path never more than three to five feet in width would run
across boulderstrewn and slope rock veri slipperi in natur below
yawn chasm more or less sheer of anyth from two to fifteen
hundr feet in depth
now a mule alwai choos the extrem edg of a precipic for thi
reason it load is commonli bound on in larg farprotrud bale
or bag were it therefor to walk on the inner side of the path it
would constantli strike it burden against the cliff so not be
troubl with nerv it cling to the outer edg a common result is
that in go round a corner it meet anoth mule proceed from the
opposit direct thereon in the attempt to struggl past on of the
pair vanish into space and with it the load merchandis or man
on thi particular mexican journei i veri nearli came to a sudden and
untim end the mule will not go your wai he alwai goe hi own
at on point on the precipic path it fork the lower fork be
rough but safe and solid the upper which travel round some twenti
yard and then again join the lower smooth but exceedingli greasi
the mule insist upon take the top road with the result that when
we reach it apex he began to slide down we shot ten or fifteen
pace to the veri edg of that aw cliff and i confess it without
shame i have rare been in such a fright in my life inde i
thought that i must be gone there seem no help for it sinc to
dismount wa quit imposs at the utter verg of the gulf
howev the anim put on a sort of vacuum brake of which a mule
alon ha the secret and when it head wa absolut hang over
it we stop that dai also thi same trusti creatur fell with me
in the midst of a flood river and in the even i end an
entertain journei by be slung across anoth roar torrent
some eighti yard wide in a loop of string attach to a veri rotten
rope along which i wa pull in jerk but of the vari experi
of that expedit i must not stop to tell i live through it so let
it memori be bless
still i do not wish to aspers the mule as upon a long journei a
realli good ambler is worth untold wealth such as a gener rule
howev do not fall to the lot of the visitor who ha to take what
he can get at the time as frequent as not pack anim which have
never carri a man befor
the mule is veri cun i saw on in cypru a note creatur which
alwai look to see whether the man who purpos to ride him is or is
not wear spur if he is he doe not mount that dai or at least
until the spur ar off the next thing thi mule look at is the
whip should it be a goad such as the nativ us he resign himself
to circumst if a mere useless walkingstick well he will not
travel fast that trip
on more thing about the mule it is hopeless to try to ride him in
the compani of hors the hors ha hi pace of walk trot and the
canter and the mule hi an ambl so that howev close togeth
their rider mai find themselv at the end of a dai journei dure
the cours of it thei will be wide separ
much of the land through which we rode to colossi wa under crop of
wheat and barlei the latter now come into ear the cultiv
struck me as gener veri poor but what can on expect in a countri
where thei mere scratch the surfac of the soil and so far as i
could see never us manur so shallow is their plough that in most
case squill and other bulbou root ar not dislodg by it but
grow on among the corn where dot about also stand mani
carobtre of which the fruit a bean is the basi of thorlei and
other food for cattl on the patch of uncultiv land a great

flower also larg root of asphodel with it stiff swordshap
leav thi wa the flower of which the greek poet were so fond of
sing their war and labour oer the hero ar to repos
in the shadowi field
of asphodel
in point of fact it is in my opinion an unpleas plant the flower
which spring from a tall stem be small individu and
neutraltint also thei have thi peculiar if cut and set in a
room thei caus the place to smell as though mani cat had slept
there
a ride of about an hour brought us to colossi that the tower in it
present shape wa built or repair in the lusignan time is evid
from the coat of armsveri beautifulli cutof the order of the
knight templar and st john which still appear upon the east face of

the castl and is adorn with a nobl vault fireplac stamp on
either side with a fleurd the tradit is that richard
coeurdelion spent hi honeymoon with berengaria in thi chamber
after rescu her vi et armi from the emperor isaac whom he
defeat in the plain below there is anoth stori which i have
heard but am unabl to trace name that richard in hi hurri to
attack the forc of the emperor outrod hi companion and reach
thi tower of colossi shook hi lanc and gallop about it alon
call to isaac who wa a poor creatur and had not the slightest
wish to accept the invit to come out and fight him
a narrow wind stair of the usual norman type whereof the end of
the step themselv form the central support column lead to the
cement roof which is flat as is common in cypru henc the view is
veri beauti for beneath li a wide stretch of countri now
look it best in the green garment of spring crop while to the
right the ey is caught by a great salt lake onc a sourc of
consider revenu to the island thi it might be again inde
were it not that with the peculiar ineptitud and want of foresight
which distinguish the agreement conclud by the govern of thi
countri as to the occup of cypru we have promis the turk not
to work it in competit with other salt lake of their own on the
mainland loveliest of all perhap is the blue background of the
measureless smile sea dot here and there with whitesail
ship
project from thi roof upon on side is a curiou grate of
massiv stone of which present i guess the us immedi
beneath hung the portculli of the castl whereof the wooden roller
or pullei ar still to be seen doubtless thi grate wa design
as a place of vantag whenc the defend could let fall stone or
boil oil and water upon the head of those who attack the
drawbridg
some rich man ought to bui colossi sweep awai the filthi
farmbuild about it and restor the tower to it origin

night wa fall befor we came home to limasol the last glow of

chapter vii
a cypriot wed
on sundai we attend church in the sergeant room a congreg
perhap of twelv or fifteen peopl limasol ha a chapel belong to
it which wa onc us for the troop but as it seem that the war
offic or the treasuri i am not sure which lai claim to the altar
rail and bench no servic is now held there in cypru as
elsewher there is such a thing as red tape
after luncheon i accompani mr michel the commission to a grand
greek wed to which he had kindli procur me an invit on
arriv at the hous we were conduct upstair to a larg central
room out of which open other room in on of these stood the bride
dress in white a pretti darkei girl to whom we were
introduc by her arrai in even cloth wa the bridegroom a
greek who is registrar of the local court and about them their
respect parent and other rel in the main apart were
assembl a mix crowd of friend guest and onlook near it
centr stood a marbletop tabl arrang as an altar with two tall
candlestick wreath in orang blossom a cup of sacrament wine
two cake of sacrament bread a silver basket hold two wreath of
orang blossom with long satin streamer attach and a copi of the
gospel beautifulli bound in emboss silver
present a process of six priest enter the room attir all of
them in magnific robe of red and blue work with silk gold and
silver thei wore tall easternlook hat veri much like those
affect by parse and had their hair arrang in a pigtail which in
some instanc hung down their back and in other wa tuck up
beneath the headdress all of them were heavili beard
most of these priest were strike in appear with face by no
mean devoid of spiritu inde studi them it struck me that
some of the apostl might have look like those men the modern idea
of the discipl of our lord is deriv in the main perhap from
pictur by artist of the renaiss school of largemad brawni
individu with wild hair and veri stronglymark counten
quit differ from the type that is preval in the east todai it
is probabl that these fanci portrait have no trustworthi basi to
recommend them to our convict that in appear inde the chosen
twelv did not differ veri wildli from such men of the more
intellectu stamp as ar now to be seen in cypru and syria but
thi is a question that could be argu indefinit on moreov not
suscept of proof
tradit howev curious unvari in thi instanc ha assign
to the saviour a certain type of face which with differ and
modif is not unlik that of at least two of the priest whom
i saw at thi ceremoni thei look good men intellectu men men
who were capabl of thought and workveri differ for exampl in
their gener aspect and atmospher to the vast major of those
priest whom the travel see in such a place as florenc still the
reput of these greek clergi is not uncommonli malodor critic
sai hard thing of them as the laiti do of the priest in south
america probabl all these thing ar not true in everi land the
clergyman is an individu set upon a pedest at whom it is easi to
throw dirt and when the dirt strike it stick so that all the world
mai see and pass by on the other side doubtless howev here as
elsewher there ar backslid and of these after the fashion of
the world we hear more than of the good and quiet men who do their
duti accord to their light and opportun and ar still
when all the preliminari were finish the bride and bridegroom took
their place befor the tablealtar which i have describ and
cross themselv ceremoni then the servic began it wa long
and impress consist chiefli of prayer and passag of
scriptur read or chant by the differ priest in turn sever
men stand round them who were i suppos profession inton
the respons with consider effect at an appoint place in the
ceremoni a priest produc two ring with which he touch the
forehead and breast of the contract parti make with them the
sign of the cross on of these ring wa then put on by the
bridegroom and the other oddli enough over her glove by the bride
at later period of the servic the silvercov book of the gospel
wa given to the pair to kiss and cottonse emblemat appar
of fertil like our rice wa thrown on to them from an adjoin
room also and thi wa the strangest part of the ceremoni the two
wreath that i have describ were taken from the silver basket and
set respect upon the brow of the bridegroom and the veil alreadi
wreathcrown of the bride where it did not sit well at all give
her in fact a somewhat bacchanalian air the bridegroom also look
peculiar with thi floral decor perch abov hi spectacl
especi as it pendant satin tail were seiz by six or eight of
hi groomsmen of all ag who with their helpth bride be
similarli escort by her ladiesproceed to drive the pair of them
thrice round the altart inde thi part of the servic howev
deepli symbol it mai be undoubtedli had a comic side anoth
rite wa that of the kiss by the priest of the wreath when set
upon the head of the contract parti and the kiss of the
hand of the priest by the bride and bridegroom
after these wreath had been remov the newlymarri pair partook of
the communion in both kind bite thrice at the consecr cake of
bread that wa held to their mouth and drink i think three sip
of the wine thi done the element were remov the ceremoni end
with a solemn bless deliv by the head priest and the embrac
of the bride and bridegroom by their respect relat at thi
point the bride wept after the fashion of ladi in her situat
throughout the world inde she wa move to tear at sever stage
of the servic
after it wa over in compani with other guest we offer our
congratul to the pair drank wine to their health and partook
of sweetmeat also we inspect the nuptial chamber which wa
adorn with satin pillow of a bright and beauti blue i am
inform but of thi matter i have no person knowledg that the
friend of the bride stuff her mattress with great ceremoni insert
into it piec of monei and other articl of valu so we bade them
goodby and now as then i wish to both of them everi excel
fortun in life
it struck me as curiou that with so mani church close at hand thi
rite should have been celebr in a room the last solemn ceremoni
connect with the fortun of man at which i assist in a privat
hous wa in iceland amid the winter sea far awai from thi southern
home of venu at a stead where i wa stai dwelt an ag man a
rel of the owner of the farm whom thei were support out of
chariti there is no poorlaw in iceland so relat ar legal
oblig to take it place a state of affair that must lead to
curiou complic
while i wa in the housea lone place far from ani other steadth
old man di thei made him a coffin and laid him in it and i wa
invit to be present at the ceremoni which follow it consist
chiefli of a long and most beauti chant which as i wa told had
come down for mani gener but ha never been print all present
in the room perhap a dozen peopl inton thi solemn chant
stand round the coffin where the dead man lai with the light
shine upon hi snowi beard and calm majest face then thei prai
and the coffin wa close afterward i saw a littl parti of rough
earnest men carri it over the rock down to the head of the fiord
where a boat wa wait there thei laid it and row awai till thei
were swallow up in the awesom loneli of mountain sky and sea
which seem to sleep beneath the blue and ghostli shadow of the
iceland summer night
to return to cypru later in the afternoon of the wed we went for
a ride to the militari camp about three mile from limasol onc
there wa a regiment quarter here but the garrison is now i think
reduc to a singl compani it would be difficult to find a healthier
or more conveni site whereat to station soldier the place be
high and the water excel perhap those empti hut will be fill
again some dai
on our wai back we pass through a grove of the most gigant
olivetre that i ever saw those in the garden of gethseman seem
small compar to them have a rule in my pocket i dismount and
took the measur of on of these it prove to be approxim fifti
feet in circumfer by sixteen in diamet at the ground but of
cours wa almost hollow how old must that tree be take into
consider the hard wood and slowgrow habit of the oliv i
imagin that in the time of the roman and veri possibl in those of
the ptolemi it wa alreadi bear fruit perhap a mycenian or
on of alexand legionari plant it who can sai probabl
too it will last for anoth three or four hundr year befor in
the grip of slow decai that end overtak it which await everyth
earthli not except the old earth herself
on morn mr mavrogordato the command of polic of the limasol
district to whose kind i ow mani of the photograph of scene in
cypru which ar reproduc in these page took us to see the ancient
fortress of the town now us as it prison the road to thi castl
pass through a disus turkish graveyard where mr mavrogordato ha
had the happi thought to plant tree which in that kindli air and
soil ar now grow up into a welcom patch of greeneri and shade
thi castl is a massiv build in stone belong appar to the
venetian period that is abov ground for the chapel and vault
below ar gothic the interior is kept most scrupul clean and
whitewash round the central well run galleri in two storei
which galleri ar divid into cell whereof the iron gate ar
secur with larg and resplend brass padlock i do not think that
i ever saw padlock which shone so bright from side to side of the
second stori stretch across the deep well beneath is an
uglylook black balk of timer and screw into it ar two bolt
and ey of singularli uncompromis and suggest appear thi
is the gallow beam so place and arrang that the prison in the
cell have the advantag of a daili contempl of the last bridg
of evil footstep an execut from that beam and there have been
sever i believ must creat quit an excit among the
wrongdoer of limasol
it is curiou by the wai although i daresai that the thought mai
never have occur to the reader how singularli ugli ar the
instrument of judici death and torment take a rack for instanc
even those who had not the slightest idea of it sinist us would
exclaimwhat a hideou thing i have seen a certain rack in on of
the old citi of north holland alkmaar or hoorn i think whereof
the mere appear is distress yet it ha none of the superflu
complic of more highli finish instrument of it class inde
it is of a stern simplic a board two roller two windlass
handl and trestl leg bolt togeth veri stout and broadfoot
yet the man who made it contriv to fill it everi line with a
horribl suggest thu the plank like the bottom of some old
coffin is cut in and out to the shape of the human bodi and each
other part ha some separ quaintlydread look again how ugli
ar a beheadingblock and it companion ax even a pair of stock is
not ornament and i am told that the new electr machin of death
now us in the unit state is a thing hideou to behold
the subject is disagre so i will not treat of it further except
to sai gener that there seem to be some mysteri rapport
between violent suffer and death and the instrument which man
ha found most conveni to produc them here we have anoth
exemplif of the old proverblik to liketh cruel thing to
the cruel deed but thi matter is too larg to enter upon in the
page of a book of travel
on the occas of my visit amongst other convict there were in the
limasol prison contempl the gallowsbeam aforesaid four men who
were accus of the murder of a fellowvillag suspect of have
poison their cattl murder is a crime of not uncommon occurr in
cypru where mani of the inhabit ar veri poor and desir of
earn monei even in reward of the destruct of a neighbour with
whom thei have no quarrel it ha been prove in the cours of
investig of some of these case that the fee paid wa realli
absurdli small so low as ten shill inde or as on of the
judg inform me in the instanc of a particularli abomin
slaughter four shill and no more some of the victim suffer on
account of quarrel about women as in mexico where in a singl
villag street on a sundai morn after the orgi of a saturdai
night i have seen as mani as three dead or at least two dead and on
dy more frequent howev in cypru the victim is a downright
bad charact of whom a commun ar determin to be rid so that in
fact the murder as in the present exampl partak of the natur of
lynchlaw
after the commiss of the crime it perpetr if suspect hide
themselv in the mountain where thei must be hunt down like wild
beast on parti of these outlaw defi arrest for quit a number of
month dure which time thei took sever shot at the pursu mr
mavrogordato ultim howev thei were themselv shot or
caught and hang
the view from the top of the castl wa perhap even more beauti
than that of colossi in front the boundless sea whereon poor
berengaria of navarr roll in the road of limasol suffer such
dire perplex and exercis so wise a caution behind the slope
of the grei mountain with trooido tower abov them whitecap
just now with snow to the right the salt lake and immedi
beneath the town dot here and there with palm
just at the foot of the fortress is the turkish quarter for the most
part noth better than a collect of mud hovel the popul of
cypru it mai be explain is divid into turk and pure cypriot
these turk i suppos ar the descend of those member of the
invad ottoman armi under mustafa which conquer cypru three
centuri ago who elect to remain in the island as settler the
proport is roughlyturk onethird of the popul cypriot
twothird the turk who gener live in villag by themselv
ar go down the hill rapidli both in number and wealth be
poor lazi fatalist and quit unfit to cope with their clever
christian compatriot in mani instanc howev thei ar respect
and respect member of the commun brave in person and upright
in conduct few of them can afford more than on wife and as a rule
their famili seem small
the richer and more success class of cypriot have a habit of
adopt greek name but in fact veri few of them ar greek except
for so much of the mycenian blood as mai remain in their vein still
some of them intrigu against the british govern and affect a
patriot desir for union with greec that even the disillusion
of the turkish war ha not quench these aspir which in some
instanc at ani rate ar said to be not uninfluenc by the hope of
reward and appoint when the bless chang occur ar scarc
like to be realis if cypru is ever hand over to ani on by
great britain it must be to it nomin suzerain the sultan to whom
the revers belong but sure after the stori of the recent
massacr of christian and other event connect with turkish rule
british public opinion exercis as it is profoundli by the exist
if halfavow allianc between thi countri and the evil system which
the sultan repres could never allow of such a step it would be
monstrou to give back christian into hi keep and a crime to
plung cypru onc more into the helpless hopeless ruin out of which
under our just if sore hamper govern it is be slowli
lift
after inspect mr mavrogordato studif that be the correct
expressionof home pigeon which with characterist energynot
too common a qualiti in cyprush is breed up from import bird
we descend from the roof to the foundat of the castl here we
visit a larg vault place whereof the window have been built up
in some past ag now we see by the light of our lantern it is a
rubbish room and befor that as i imagin from sever indic
under the turkish rgime probabl it serv as a magazin for the
storag of powder in the old dai howev thi place wa a chapel
and here it is said upon what exact author i know not that
richard coeurdelion wa marri to berengaria of navarr the onli
account of these nuptial that i can lai my hand on at thi moment is
from a contemporari chronicl of geoffrei de vinsauf or vinosalvo he
it will be observ although write of limasol or limouzin as he
call the town doe not mention the church in which the wed wa
solemnis if there wa more than on avail which is to be
doubt it seem most probabl that the chapel of the fortress would
have been chosen thi is what geoffrei sai
on the morrow name on the sundai which wa the festiv of st
pancra the marriag of king richard and berengaria the daughter
of the king of navarr wa solemnis at limouzin she wa a
damsel of the greatest prudenc and most accomplish manner and
there she wa crown queen there were present at the ceremoni
the archbishop and the bishop of evreux and the bishop of banera
and mani other chief and nobl the king wa gloriou on thi
happi occas and cheer to all and show himself joyou and
affabl
how strang ar the vicissitud of wall the fortun of the
shortliv gener that inhabit them ar not so variabl for
these stone last longer and see more what a contrast between thi
place in it present state lumberstrewn and lit onli by a few dim
lamp to that which it must have present in the year 1191 when the
warrior king richard on of the most remark and attract
charact who occupi the long page of our english histori took to
himself a wife within their circuit it is not difficult even to the
dullest and least imagin of the few travel who strai to thi
unvisit place to reconstruct someth of that pageant of the
mighti dead the splendid figur of the king himself clad in shirt of
mail and broider tabard gai with the royal arm of england the fair
bride glitter in her beauti silken garment and rich adorn
of gem the archbishop and bishop in their mitr pomp the great
lord and attend knight arrai in their variou armour the crowd
of squir and servitor press about the door the altar deck
with flower the song of such chorist as could be found among the
crew of the galleysal the gather splendour rude but impress
of perhap the most picturesqu ag that is known to histori
then these great folk thousand of mile awai from their northern
home who had labori travel hither expos to the most fear
danger by land and sea endur such privat as few common
soldier would now consent to bear not to possess themselv of
goldmin or for ani other thinlyveil purpos of gain but in the
fulfil of a great idea and that ideawhat wa it to carri out a
trust which thei conceiv wise or in foolish to be laid upon
themth rescu of the holi place from the befoul hand of the
infidel well thei ar gone and their caus is lost and the moslem
support by the realm which onc thei rule still squat in the holi
land such is the ironi of fate but for my part i think that these
old crusad and especi our hothead richard of england cruel
though he wa at time as we shall see at acr ar worthi of more
sympathi than a practic ag seem inclin to wast upon them peac
to their warlik superstiti soul
on leav the castl we visit an inn in the yard of which stood
score of mule it wa an odorifer but interest place under a
shed at on side of it sat about a dozen smith at work men who hire
their stand at a yearli or monthli rent fix into the ground befor
each of themit must be rememb that these peopl sit at their
work which is all done on the cold iron without the help of firewa
a tini anvil on these anvil the craftsmen were emploi in
fashion the great horsesho nail of the countri or in cut out
and hammer thin flat iron plate which ar us in the east for
the shoe of mule and donkei these disc that ar made with onli
on small hole in the centr must in mani wai be prejudici to the
comfort and health of the beast or so we should think sinc thei
caus it frog to grow foul and rot awai the teach of practic
experi howeverfor which after some studi of such thing i have
great respectseem to prove thi kind of shoe to be best suit for
us upon the stoni track of the countri these plate ar secur to
the anim hoof by six of the hugehead nail that i have
mention and if properli fix will last for sever month without
renew
the instrument us to trim the hoof befor the shoe is fasten is a
marvel tool almost of the size of a sickl with a flat knife
attach to it as larg as a child spade probabl all these
implement especi if connect in ani wai with agricultur such
as the wooden hook with an iron point which thei call a plough ar
essenti the same as those that were familiar to the phoenician
and the mycenian greek in the holi land at ani rate as we shall
see later thei have not chang sinc the time of our lord
that thi wa so as regard the shoe of hors in or about the year
1430 is prove by the follow passag which i take from the travel
of bertrandon de la brocquir of guinn who made a pilgrimag to
palestin in 1432 he sai
i bought a small hors that turn out veri well befor my
departur i had him shod in damascu and thenc as far as bursa
which is fifti dai journei so well do thei shoe their hors
that i had noth to do with hi feet except on of the fore
on which wa prick by a nail and made him lame for three
week the shoe ar light thin lengthen toward the heel and
thinner there than at the toe thei ar not turn up and have
but four nailhol two on each side the nail ar squar with
a thick and heavi head when a shoe is want and it is necessari
to work it to make it fit the hoof it is done cold without ever
put it in the fire which can readili be done becaus it is so
thin to pare the hoof thei us a prune knife similar to what
vinedress trim their vine with both on thi as well as on
the other side of the sea
thi descript might well appli to the shoe of anim in cypru
and syria todai
from the inn we walk to the municip market where we found mani
strang veget for sale includ radish larg as a fullgrown
carrot noth smaller in the radish line seem to flourish here and
i am inform that for some occult reason it is imposs to
intercept them in an intermedi stage of their develop perhap
like mushroom thei spring up in a singl night i am grate to
these veget howev for the sight of them made clear to me the
mean of a passag by which i have long been worri i rememb
read i forget where in the account of on of the
pyramidbuild pharaohschufu i believethat he suppli ten of
thousand of bunch of radish daili to the hundr thousand
labour who were engag upon the work
what puzzl me wa to know how chufu provid so enorm and
perenni a suppli of thi veget the radish of cypru solv the
problem on of these would be quit enough for ani two
pyramidbuild i tast them and thei struck me as stringi and
flavourless anoth old friend in a new form wa celeri ti in
bunch but such celeri not an inch of crisp white root about it
noth but green and leatheri head it appear in thi form becaus
it ha been grown upon the top of the ground like a cabbag mani
peopl have tri to persuad the intellig cypriot to earth up hi
celeri but hitherto without result my father grew the herb thu
he answer and i grow it as my father did doubtless the
phoenician ignor of the arsen it wa said to contain like
their celeri green or perhap it wa the persian
meat and game the former markedso advanc is limasolwith the
municip stamp for octroi purpos ar also sold here there on
on stall next to a great pile of orang lie halfadozen woodcock
brown and beauti and by them a brace of french partridg now just
go out of season while further on is a fine hare on the next
hang to hook ar poor littl lamb with their throat cut
scarc bigger than the hare ani of them and fullgrown sheep some
not so larg as my fat blackfac lamb at easter a littl further
on we came to a cobbler shop where we inspect the nativ boot
these ar made of goatskin and high to the knee with sole compos
of mani thick of leather that must measur an inch through
cumbersom as thei seem the experi of centuri prove these
boot to be the best wear possibl for the inhabit of the
mountain district of thi stoni land on the veri dai of which i
write i saw a cypriot arrai in them run over the tumbl ruin
of an ancient citi and through the mud patch wherebi it wa
intersect with no more care or inconveni than we should
experi on a tenni lawn
chapter viii
amathu
now i have to tell of amathu the place we pass on our journei down
the coast todai a stonestrewn hill cover with spring corn
even in the far past amathu wa so ancient that no on knew with
certainti of it begin it is said to have been found by the
phoenician at ani rate in it flourish a templ to the god
melkarth and with it a famou shrine erect in honour of venu the
mythic hero theseu accord to on account is report to have
land here with ariadn the daughter of mino who di in
childbirth in the citi although the stori more gener accept
sai that he abandon her on the island of naxo whatev truth
there mai be in all these legendsand probabl it is but littlethi
is certain that in it dai amathu wa a great town inhabit by a
prosper and power peopl it li about five or six mile from
limasol and is approach by a road which run along the sea whenc
it is separ by a stretch of curiou black sand which blow a good
deal in high wind on the wai mr mavrogordato point out to me an
ingeni method wherebi he is attempt to turn that barren belt
into profit soil he seem to have discov that thi sand
wherein on might imagin noth would grow is suitabl to the need
of the black wattl at ani rate the tree of that speci which he
plant there although scarc more than a year old ar now larg
and flourish shrub
as we drew near to amathu i perceiv curiou hole by the roadsid
cover in for the most part with rough slab of stone onc these
hole were tomb rifl long ago then we came to the site of the
town stretch down to the seabeach where stand the remnant of a
castl which we saw from the steamer now it is noth but a hillsid
liter sown with stone that no doubt onc form the foundat
of the dwell of amathu i sai the foundat for i believ that
the hous of these ancient citi as in the villag of cypru
todai were for the most part built of green brick or what here in
norfolk we should call claylump which in the cours of centuri of
sun and rain ha melt awai into the soil the templ public
build and palac must have been magnific and as i shall show
present wonder care wa lavish upon the tomb but the
habit of the great mass of the citizen were in all likelihood
humbl and temporari structur or so i think it is the same in
egypt where the old inhabit grudg neither wealth nor labour in
the prepar of grave their everlast abod but were content
to fashion their earthli lodg of the nile mud that lai at hand
amathu must have been veri strong inde it would be difficult to
find a site better suit to defenc it is surround by steep
natur ravin which serv the purpos of moat and surmount by a
tower rock with precipit side along whose slope the citi lai
upon thi rock sai tradit stood an impregn citadel inde
the site is still call the old castl by the peasant of the
neighbour villag of agia tycheno now all these countless stone
furnish their humbl tiller with a seedb for wheat and barlei the
inexperienc might imagin that no place could be more unsuit for
the grow of crop but in fact thi is not so see that in the
sever cyprian drought stone have the properti of retain moistur
to nurtur the root which otherwis would perish
on arriv at the foot of the hill we rode round it to visit the
tomb which lie behind and beyond take with us a suppli of candl
and sever peasant as guid these sepulchr were i believ
discov and plunder more than twenti year ago by gener
cesnola the consul whose splendid collect of antiqu is to be
seen in america the first we reach lai at the bottom of a deep pit
now rapidli refil with silt wash into it by the winter wet in
the surround rubbish we could still see trace of it violat
for here lai mani fragment of ancient amphora and of a shatter
marbl sarcophagu after the rain that had fallen recent the path
through the hole lead into the tomb wa noth but a pool of
liquid mud through which to win an entranc the explor must crawl
upon hi stomach as the soil rise to within about eighteen inch of
the top block of it squar doorwai the task seem dirti and in
everi wai unpleas but i for on did not travel to cypru to be
baffl by common harmless mud so i took off my coat which in the
scant state of our wardrob i did not care to spoil and went at it
on my hand and toe that the rest of me might avoid the slush as
much as possibl
it wa a slimi and a darksom wriggl but quit safe in thi respect
differ somewhat from a journei of a like natur which i made a good
mani year ago that wa near assouan in egypt where at the time
certain new tomb had just been discov which i wa anxiou to
explor these tomb were hollow in the rock at the top of a steep
slope of sand which choke their doorwai see that as at
amathu there wa just suffici space beneath the head of the
doorwai of on of them for a man of moder size to creep through i
made the attempt alon writh forward serpentwis through the
sand present i found myself in the veri grimmest place that i have
ever visit it wa a cave of the size of a larg room and when my
ey grew accustom to the faint light which crept through the hole
i saw that it wa liter full of dead so full that their bodi
must onc have risen almost to the roof moreov these dead had not
been embalm for round me lai their clean bone by hundr and
their skull by score yet onc thi sepulchr wa at the servic of

as i wonder over these jumbl relic of the depart i rememb
have read that about the time of christ assouan wa smitten with a
fear plagu which slew it inhabit by thousand doubtless i
thought here ar the inhabit or some of them whose bodi in
such a time of pestil it would have been imposs to embalm so
thei must have brought and pile them on on anoth in the cave that
had serv as sepulchr of the richer notabl among their
forefath till all were full i rememb also that plagu germ
ar said to be singularli longliv and that these might be get
hungri with that thought i brought my examin of thi interest
place to a sudden end
just as i wa begin my outward crawl foolishli enough i shout
loudli to my companion whom i had left at the entranc of anoth
sepulchr think that he might help to pull me through the hole
almost immedi afterward i felt someth weighti begin to
trickl on to my back with an everincreas stream and in a flash
understood that the reverber of my voic had loosen the
overhang stone alreadi shaken and shatter by earthquak and
that the sand wa pour down upon me from between them heaven how
frighten i wa luckili on doe not argu under such circumst
where inde he who hesit is lost if i had stop to think
whether it would be best to go back or to go forward to go quick or
to go slow it is veri probabl that long sinc i should have ad an
alien cranium to those of that variou pile instead i crawl forward
more swiftli than ever i crawl befor notwithstand the
increas weight upon my back for the sand fell faster and faster
with the result that as no stone follow it to crush me present
somewhat exhaust i wa sit fan myself with a grate heart
in the dazzl sun without
to return to amathu and a still older tomb thi doorwai beneath
which we pass wa also squar and surmount by four separ
mould onc through it we light our candl to find ourselv
stand in a kind of chapel where i suppos the rel of the
dead assembl at funer or to make offer on the anniversari

bear thi disput in mind i ask the cypriot guid whether
gener cesnola found hi most import object heap in on place
at curium he answer that antiqu were found here and there
that often cesnola himself wa not present when thei were found but
that as thei were dug up from the tomb thei were collect by the
workmen and taken care of to be given over to him whenev he might
come i quot thi bit of evid for what it is worth as in futur
gener when all these burialplac have been thoroughli
ransack the matter mai becom of interest becaus of the sidelight
which it throw upon ancient histori
much of our knowledg of the remot past is deriv from tomb and
yet to my mind our pleas habit of violat the dead whether for
purpos of gain or in order to satisfi our thirst for inform is
not altogeth easi to justifi it is a veri ancient habit becaus of
it the mummi of rames the pharaoh of the oppress of the
wondrousfac seti hi father of the monarch of i think the
herhor dynasti and a host of other about the period of the persian
invas were move from their immemori restingplac to the hide
hole of deirelbahari long befor thi inde the ruler of egypt
know the danger were in the habit at interv of sever hundr
year of despatch royal commission to inspect the bodi of the
great depart and ascertain that thei slept safe and undisturb i
myself have seen write upon the outer wrap of the deceas
which notifi that such and such a commiss inspect the corps of
such and such a divin kingh who lai within the wrappingsnow

in thi particular instanc the effort of the ancient egyptian to

went by and in a fashion interest enough but too long to describ
here the hidingplac of deirelbahari wa discov modern

in their own time as victoria or napoleon as thei were born to the

now rent from their wrap their halfnak bodi lie in the
glass case of a museum to be stare at by everi tourist the face
befor whose frown whole nation trembl and mayhap joseph or mose

will remain until within a few decad or centuri it is burnt in a

perchancehappi destinycrumbl into dust as must happen soon or
late to be thrown out upon the dungheap for hen to scratch at
is it right i ask who have been a sinner myself in the neighbourhood
of abydo to take on exampl out of sever whereof the
recollect todai fill me with some remors i found the mummi of a
child she wa a littl girl who poor dear had live and di in
the first centuri of the christian era of greek parentag
probabl for her skin wa exceed white she lai wrap in
colour bandag not unlik some of the cotton which ar
manufactur todai and on a piec of mummi cloth which cover them
her parent had drawn a cross in red pigment and scrawl beneath it
in greek charact the word christo
i hold that holi rag in my hand as i write and it shame me that i do
so but if i had not taken it the arab who were with me and who
show me the hidingplac would have sold it to the next travel
i rememb that on the same journei we unwrap the head of a mummi
purchas from some tombbreak for a few piastr oh what a face
appear that man who had live four thousand year ago might have
been a king or a highpriest so majest were hi wither featur
certainli hi blood must have been nobl and hi place high yet hi
end wa that a doctor saw hi skull open to see how it wa embalm
mai he forgiv me for the part i took in that busi who then wa
younger and more thoughtless
at the time perhap i did not understand quit as well as i do nowi
mention thi in my excusehow sincer and solemn wa the belief which
among the old egyptian led to thi practic of embalm of all
peopl who have ever live not even exclud those of our christian
faith thei held most firmli to the doctrin of the resurrect of
the bodi therefor thei preserv that bodi against the hour of it
awaken and the idea of it disturb or destruct wa to
them horribl it wa a futil faith as thei themselv recognis
sinc know that no effort of their own could guard against futur

itself in other wai and we mai ventur to believ that at the last
the spirit thei were so sure of will not be left without it
tabernacl
yet is our offenc as great although with a strang and gross
materi we suppos when we consid the matter at all that the
fact of these folk have di so long ago make them fair prei for
our greed or curios but what is time to the dead ten million ag

conscious refound thei must be on on awaken in each case the
recollect would be as vivid the aspir the motiv the

distinct onc the sens ar shut time ceas to exist if in truth
it exist at all then is the offenc of the violat of thi
hallow dust so carefulli hid awai ani the less becaus it ha slept
five thousand year than it would be in the case of a resurrect
man who drag it from the grave it ha occupi six hour to sell it
to the dissectingt we ar so apt to judg of the dead by the
standard of the possibl feel of the survivor forget that
thei mai have their own feel also the survivor or rather the
depart contemporari mai still be shock
these poor phoenician of amathu had no such high hope although
from time to time there were plenti in cypru who share them yet
thei built their sepulchr with extraordinari expens and care
face toward the sea as though thei wish to watch the sun rise and
set for ever we break into them under the written order of the
british museum or secretli by night and drag their ear from
their ear and their ring from their finger and set their stare
skull upon back shelv in dealer den in limasol where onc thei

the next tomb we came to had a beauti vshape doorwai though onli
the top of the invert v wa visibl abov the rubbish i did not go
in here be alreadi suffici plaster with mud almost from
head to foot inde but my companion who is young and activ
achiev the adventur as it turn out it might veri easili have
been hi last for in climb up the wall of the pit again hi foot
slip on a littl piec of greasi earth and down he went backward
drag two cypriot with him in such fashion that all three of them
lai in a tangl heap at the bottom of the hole the sight wa
ludicr enough but as the older of the two guid explain to us
had it not been for hi quick and address my nephew would
certainli have met with a seriou accid the man saw from the wai
he wa fall that hi head or neck must strike against a stone at
the bottom of the pit and manag to thrust hi arm and thick sleev
between the two onc my own life wa save in a veri similar fashion
except that no human agenc interven i wa gallop a poni along
an african road when suddenli it cross it leg and went down as
though it had been shot in fall my head struck a stone on the road
with great forc but by chanc the thick cloth hat which i wa
wear be jerk from it place interpos itself as a kind of
doubledup cushion between my templ and the stone with the result
that i escap with slight concuss i rememb that the shock of
the fall wa so great that my stout buckskin brace were burst into
four piec
that my nephew danger wa not exagger by the cypriot is shown
by the fact that within the last few year at the mouth of thi or
the veri next tomb a german professor wa kill in precis the same
wai inde now that i think of it i rememb read of hi sad
death in a paper that poor gentleman who wa accompani onli by an
old woman have finish hi inspect began to climb up the side
of the pit when a stone came out in hi hand and he fell head first to
the bottom he onli live about five minut and our friend the
protect cypriot help to carri awai hi bodi
after thi experi have had enough of the interest but dirti
pursuit of tomb we mount our mule and rode round the hill of
the ancient citi a stonestrewn and somewhat awkward path the
street there must have been veri steep in their dai and a walk up to
the citadel on busi or to bui a slave or two kidnap on the
shore of britain as a special line for the cyprian market excel
exercis for the fat old winebib merchant whose scatter bone
and broken drinkingcup we had just been handl yonder among the
tomb
now the place is melancholi in it desol there is noth left
noth it might have form the text of on of isaiah propheci
so swept of life is it and of all outward memori of life i could
onli find on remnant on the face of a tower rock we discov a
short uncial greek inscript which is begin to feel the effect
of weather our unit scholarship piec thi much out of it luciu
vitelliu the great conqueror erect thi from hi own here the
inform come to a full stop for we could not make out ani more
perhap some reader of thi page mai know with certainti which luciu
vitelliu is refer to and why he wa engag in conquer at
amathu is it perchanc luciu vitelliu the father of the emperor
who wa governor in syria in ad 34 if so he might well have
describ himself as the great humbug instead of the great
conqueror as is prove by the famou stori that is told of him
concern caligula and the moon accord to tacitu howev he
wa a good governor i am not ignor that he had a bad name in rome
and that mani scandal thing were said of him but in the
administr of the provinc he show the virtu of an earlier

i daresai that yonder crumbl screed mai be the onli actual monument
that is left todai of thi vitelliu hi pomp hi cun and hi
flatteri
as we return home the scene wa veri beauti in the west the sun
sank gorgeous hi fanlik arrow break and reflect
themselv from the dens purpl undercloud that had gather and
lai low upon the horizon of the slumber deep high abov in the
fathomless blue space of the cyprian heaven rode the great moon
now round to her full her bright face mark with mountain scar
and the light that lai on sea sky and land on the plain of limasol
and the mount of ruin amathu who shall describ themthos
chang manycolour light so delic so variou and so
solemn
on the dai after our visit to amathu i attend the courthous to
listen to the magisteri examin of the men whose number had
now increas to six whom i had seen previous in jail await
their trial upon a charg of murder the court wa crowd with the
rel of the accus zaptieh or policemen a select of
idler from among the gener public a goodli number of greek
advoc crowd togeth in the front bench and the six prison
themselv all squeez into a dock which wa much too small for them
where thei stood in a doubl row listen to the evid with an
indiffer air real or affect for the rest mr mavrogordato as i
am told a verit terror to evildo conduct the case for the
prosecut bring out hi point with great clear while the
district judg mr parker sat as a magistr court the judici
function of the legal offici in cypru ar by the wai rather
curious mix the same individu be abl appar to sit in
vari executori capac
the case wa open by the differ advoc announc for which of
the prison thei appear then mr mavrogordato took up hi parabl
and began to examin the greek doctor through an interpret whose
somewhat lengthi translat made the proceed rather slow when
after a coupl of hour we had just got to the point where he turn
the bodi over grow weari i went home to lunch to thi hour i
cannot sai whether or no those reput murder or if ani which of
them still adorn the land of life or whether under mr
mavrogordato guidanc thei have pass beneath that black beam
which span the central well in the old castl at limasol i think
veri possibl howev that thei were all acquit or repriev for
although i am certain that thei or some of them did the deed from
the open of the case out of the depth of a not inconsider
experi of such inquiri i am convinc that everi ounc of the
evid in possess of the prosecut wa absolut and sole
circumstanti moreov although thei had dug him up again and
look for it the miss knifepoint could not be found in the
vital of the latela cattlepoison rascal whom somebodi had
slain a broken and recov knifepoint goe a long wai with a juri
and it absenc is equal favour to the prison
on afternoon i attend some athlet sport at limasol it wa a
gener feastdai in honour of what or of whom i griev to sai i
forget but on that occas there were festiv everywher
earlier in the dai i went for a ride to a villag some mile distant
which also wa celebr sport that is to sai a few lounger were
gather togeth about an open place in the hamlet and nobodi wa
do ani work thi i notic howev both in the villag
aforesaid on the ground at limasol and from the spire of all the
church that i could see a flag wa fly as it wa a public
holidai on might have expect that thi flag would be english or
perhap here and there in defer to ancient and longestablish
custom ottoman it wa neither it wa greek everywher that not
veri attract banner flaunt in the wind i ask the reason but
nobodi seem to know an answer thei suggest howev that it had
someth to do with the greek church and ad that the upper
class of the cypriot who call themselv but ar not greek
alwai flew the greek flag
i submit that thi is not a good thing throughout the world and at
all period of it histori the flag flown is the symbol of the
author acknowledg or that the popul wish to acknowledg in
cypru of cours the bulk of the inhabit ar not concern in thi
matter the villag of the remot hill and plain care littl about
banner but if thei see continu that of greec displai on everi
church tower and high place and never or rare that of great
britain which rule them thei mai not unnatur draw their own
conclus it is a small affair perhap but on i believ which
might with advantag be attend to by the govern eastern peopl
do not understand our system of laissez fair where the symbol of
author ar concern and ar apt to argu that we ar afraid to
show the colour which we do not fly the union jack is not a banner
that should be hidden awai in british territori nor is thi my own
view onli it is share by everi unoffici englishman in cypru
though these ar few offici mai have their opinion also but it
would not be fair to quot them
after the sport were over i had an interest convers with a
gentleman well acquaint with the custom of the countri he told me
that few trace of the old phoenician rite remain except that which
is still celebr in some district upon whitsundai then as did
their forefath thousand of year sinc the villag go down to
the sea and bath there both sex togeth it is the ancient
welcom given to venu in the island fabl to be her chosen hous
mix up perhap with some christian ceremoni of wash and
regener the bather throw water over each other but so far as
outward appear go there is noth incorrect in their conduct at
these quaint and primit celebr
my friend told me also to return to anoth subject of the vast
benefit which the british govern ha confer upon the island by
the practic extermin of the locust all the ancient visitor to
cypru or at least mani of them speak of thi curs which twenti
year ago and even on the occas of my last visit wa in full
oper an ingeni greek gentleman devis the remedi roughli
the system is thi locust impel thereto by on of those wondrou
instinct that continu amaz the student of natur at the
appoint season select certain land wherein to lai their egg which
must not be too deep or too shallow and when the pest begin to grow
must furnish certain food on the surfac of the sandi soil necessari
to their support observ soon enabl skill person to discov
these spot then the system first invent by mr mattei and
perfect by my late friend mr samuel brown is brought into
oper
briefli it consist of the erect of screen of canva mani yard
in length edg at the top with shini american cloth in front of
which screen ar dug deep trench about a fortnight after the
locust ar hatch out of the egg have exhaust the suppli at the
breedingplac thei begin their march across countri in search of
nutriment then it is that strang thing happen to them for climb
up the canva screen which thei find bar their path their feet
slip upon the leather and down thei slide backward into the
readymad grave beneath befor thei can crawl up again other tumbl
on the top of them and so it goe on till the trench is full now
observ human be arriv cover it in to prevent effluvium and
move the screen a few yard further on to anoth trench that thei
have prepar where thi page of locusthistori repeat itself it
might be thought that learn wisdomfrom hi fellow fateth
locust would in time educ himself to go round the screen but not
so for of all thi insect characterist obstinaci is the most
promin he mean to travel a certain path if it involv hi
death so much the wors at least he will travel till he di
doubtless it is thi singl of purpos thi incap of
chang hi mind that make the locust so great and formid
and formid he is or wa as ani on will know who ha ever seen a
stretch of grow corn or a grove of fruittre or ani green thing
that is of servic to man over which the locust ha pass joel the
prophet knew him long ago befor ever messr mattei and brown had at
last taught human how to beat him ie in an island like cypru
he hath laid my vine wast and bark my figtre he hath made it
clean bare and cast it awai the branch thereof ar made
white how do the beast groan the herd of cattl ar
perplex becaus thei have no pastur yea the flock of sheep ar
made desol and againher he describ them at their work could
it be more vividli done could ani word give a more vivid pictur of
the overwhelm invas of thi bane and the wast it leav behind
a fire devoureth befor them and behind them a flame burneth the
land is as the garden of eden befor them and behind them a desol
wilder yea and noth shall escap them like the nois
of chariot on the top of mountain shall thei leap like the nois
of a flame that devoureth the stubbl
such inde is the sound that ha been heard to rise from the million
of their move jaw
howev as i have said thank to the continu exert of the
govern locust ar now practic extermin in cypru
what their ravag have been in the island for ag past mai be
gather from a singl quotat which i take from the write of
benedetto bordon the geograph of padua whose work wa publish
in 1528 it is onli on exampl but it will serv
but among so much good that there mai be noth in thi world
without it bitter the luck of the island ha thi on
drawback mingl with it bless so heavi a curs that men
can hardli bear up against itthat a vast multitud of
cavalett or locust appear with the young wheat these as thei
pass from place to place ar so mani in number that like a thick
cloud thei hide the sun and where thei light thei devour and
consum not onli the grain and grass but even the root below
ground so that on might sai that fire had blast everyth

charm as is cypru in mani wai it is a place where the travel
especi the english travel and still more the unoffici
dweller in the land ha some reason to congratul himself if he wa
born with the gift of patienc and humil in practic the island
is inhabit by two class onli the govern offici and the
nativ cypriot between these there is a great gulf fix in itself
a bad thing as i think sinc it is not good for ani man or bodi of
men to be continu surround by peopl whom thei consid veri
much their inferior in africa i have known weak folk driven crazi by
thi plethora of author and nine individu out of ten it make
conceit onli realli largemind men can bear the weight of
unquest power and remain unspoil men big enough to know how
frail and small the rest of us ar

float there in other word an inhabit who is not an offici ha
no posit in cypru and is collect releg to a class by
himself or so it seem to me it is howev veri much to be
regret that thi class is not larger in that event not onli would
life becom less narrow in the island for red tape in quantiti doe
restrict the intellect it ruler also would be expos to the tonic
and stimulu of compet and independ public opinion at present
of factiou opposit to the govern from the greek parti and
other there is plenti of intellig and suggest critic at the
hand of equal and compatriot littl or none at all
the question of social statu and preced do not affect the
travel howev though if he be of an observ mind thei mai
amus him what doe affect him ar the hidebound cyprian
regul on i have mention and it inconveniencesthat have
to do with revolversbut it is as noth compar to those which
overtak the individu who ventur to come to cypru arm with a
fowlingpiec in the hope of shoot duck or woodcock i
unfortun had sent mine on and find it await me at the
customhous at limasol suggest that i might take it awai thereon
i wa inform veri polit that i must compli with a few
formal first it prove imper that i should obtain from the
govern at nicosia a certif that i wa a fit and proper person
to be allow to carri so danger a weapon as a shotgun secondli
a valu must be set upon the said gun which must be approv thirdli
the fourth part of the valu thu ascertain must be paid over in

it can easili be imagin that by the time i had written the necessari
letter sign the necessari document paid the necessari deposit
and interview the necessari number of offic i wish almost that
i had thrown my gun into the sea befor i wa foolish enough to bring
it to cypru even now when the troubl is done with i ventur to ask
whether all these formal ar realli need in the case of a
person known to be a bonfid travel who propos to tarri for a

cyprian regul and of their method of enforc
a more seriou matter as i myself experienc for which inde the
govern is not respons although i think it might take action
to prevent the inconveni is connect with the turkish telegraph
line which purport to deliv messag in cypru what happen and
ha happen perpetu for the last year or so sinc the cabl wa
hopelessli broken and intermitt befor that time is that a
messag taken by the turkish line without warn or other
enlighten to the sender in whatev part of the world he mai be
pass over their wire to port said or beyrout where it is left to
lie until a ship is sail thenc it is sent on by post and
retelegraph from larnaca to it address by the eastern telegraph
compani for which servic is charg a fee of on and ninep
in my case i despatch a cabl to itali by the eastern telegraph
compani to which i had previous arrang to receiv an immedi
repli no answer came and i grew anxiou dai pass and final the
repli did come a week late have been forward by post from port
said my hostess inform me that within a singl year the same thing
had happen no less than thrice to peopl stai in her hous for a
specimen result i quot an instanc that occur just befor i
arriv the father of a ladi who wa stai with a friend in the
island di in england and the sad new wa at onc telegraph to
her thi messag wa sent by the turkish wire with the shock
result that the person concern first learn of her bereav
through a casual perus of the advertis column of the time
the cabl itself wa deliv a dai or so later than the newspap
it would seem that the govern might move to put a stop to thi
constant and intoler scandal of a telegraph line accept and
be paid for messag which it ha neither the intent nor the
mean of deliv i am inform howev that it doe not do so
becaus such action might rais a polit question and give
offenc to the turk if i were in a posit of author i think
that i should take the risk of that offenc and of the us of a littl
plain languag
still notwithstand these and other drawback unavoid perhap
in a countri soak with orient tradit cypru is in mani wai a
most delight spot and it is remark that more english peopl do
not live there at least for the winter season actual resid in

sceneri of the pine forest sinc lawntenni parti and picnic
where the guest ar continu the same will pall on all except the
youngest and most enthusiast for the other nine month of the year
or most of them the climat is pleasant and healthi
i know that in the last respect it ha a differ reput

the turk some regiment of debilit troop were sent from egypt
to recov in cypru those in author proceed to secur thi

the end of summer and dure our stai in the island though it
wa in the spring a contagi distemp swept awai great number
at nicosia but the air is most noxiou at famagusta and lernaca
ow to the vapour rise from the fen and saltpan in the
neighbourhood and at lernaca the air is most unhealthi when the
sun is abov the horizon
also richard pocock whose wellknown work wa publish in london in
1743 write
these mountain and the shallow soil which is mostli on a white
freeston make it excess hot in summer and the island is
veri unhealthi especi to stranger who often get fever here
which either carri them off or at least continu for a
consider time the disord lurk in the blood and
occas frequent relaps
to come to quit recent time monsieur delaroir whose book voyag
en orient wa publish in 1836 talk of larnaca sai
we went out to thi shrine which is charmingli situat near a
great lake and wood hill but the air is veri unwholesom in a
visit we paid to the sheik we saw the insalubr of the place
stamp on everi face the pale and leaden complexion testifi
to habitu fever
these short quotat which could be easili supplement by other
of like tenor suffic to show that the healthi of cypru ha
alwai been in bad reput why thi is so i cannot sai for given the
most ordinari precaut among warm countri it is certainli the
most wholesom that i have visit i have scarc heard of a death
that could in ani wai be attribut to climat among the european
offici and children of northern blood seem to flourish there
probabl it reput mai be set down to the lack of those ordinari
precaut and the insanitari condit of the place in the past few
peopl whose read ha not been more or less extens know the
extent of the mortal throughout all land in bygon gener a
great proport of the death rate everywher wa i am convinc due
to typhoid which nobodi knew how to treat or how to avoid it had not
even ani specif name except the gener term of feaver for proof
of thi such work as the vernei memoir mai be consult it is
probabl that a travel from cypru visit london about the year
1600 might have return and describ the citi as most unwholesom
live in cypru is extraordinarili cheap a famili can flourish there
and have mani comfort such as ridinghors c who at home would
be oblig to look twice at a bu fare and consid a visit to the pit
of a theatr a great luxuri servant also ar inexpens and on the
whole might be a great deal wors on in a hous where i receiv
hospit wa realli a veri good allround man he went by the name
of cristo or christ an appel common enough in cypru though
on from the us of which northern peopl would refrain there wa a
boi also an amus young rascal who when taken into servic
evid wa half starv then he made up for it for to my own
knowledg he could devour a larg tin of bad pot lobster with
appetit and without ill effect nor did he shrink from swallow at
a draught a whole tureen of mintsauc on such diet he grew wondrou
fat
in cypru everybodi depend upon the sun which is presum to be but
is not alwai on show at ani rate in the winter month fireplac
in the dwellingroom ar a luxuri introduc by the english pleasant
enough and even need in januari and februari when the sun refus
to shine inconveni ensu thu the wash gener come home
wet and i could discov but on mean of air itto place the
garment which it wa propos to wear on the follow dai in bed and
sleep upon them thi receipt i frequent adopt old travel
will know the plan and young on mai note the same
fourteen year or so ago when i wa there cypru wa a veri happi
hunt ground for the lover of antiqu then mani desir
thing could still be purchas for instanc there were object of
silver that i suppos must be of mediaev date or a littl later
work buckl that were worn by the inhabit on great occas
round or shellshap and veri beauti of which in those dai i
obtain sever pair also there were curiou reliquari to be worn
about the neck gener fashion in the form of a hollow cross
insid of which wa place a bit of saint or some other sacr scrap
now few such object ar to be found nearli all have vanish i
search the bazaar at nicosia and everi like place in other town
without discov even a singl pair of buckl i could find
noth except on small reliquari verit antiqu ar almost
as rare todai ow larg to the prohibit that ha been put
upon privat dig in the interest of the british museum
on my first visit i wa rather fortun thu in a villag not far
from cyrenia i bought for a small sum from the man who dug it up a
beautifulli work orient bowl of bronz date i should think
from the fifteenth or sixteenth centuri in thi bowl the finder
discov coin which he sold for the sum of three hundr pound
their valu by weight what coin thei were i cannot sai for he had
part with everi on and could give no clear descript of them
also i obtain from him a piec of glass which he had found that at
onc struck me as veri curiou it is about six inch high round
with a narrow neck and it great peculiar li in the fact that it
ha five spiral of glass that spring from near the bottom of the
bowl clear it arch to join the vessel again at the root of it
neck thi vase i carri in my hand on horseback for mani a weari
mile fear accid and ultim brought it safe to england
here as i saw that he wa much struck with it i gave it to my
friend sir john evan who read a paper on the piec at the societi
of antiquari in whose record it is publish it seem that the
vessel is roman and uniqu sir john evan ingeni discov the
method by which it wa made and even caus a replica to be
manufactur how it would be too long and difficult to explain thi
replica i still possess
proceed march 13 1890
anoth find wa a marbl head that onc ha worn a bronz helmet it
seem to be of a veri good greek style and period at first i thought
that it had adorn a statu of a goddess but a wellknown export
tell me that after take measur c he believ it to be a
contemporan portrait of faustina of which ladi of that name i am
not certain but i imagin the elder thi head the best thing of
the sort that i can find in ani cyprian collect either in the
island or the british museum i discov serv the gentleman who
plough it up as a doorstop but although he valu it so littl it
took me two year to reduc it into possess as i think that the
man who own the land where it wa found claim an interest in the
marbl anoth beauti object that came my wai wa a corrod
silver ring found in a tomb with an engrav scarabaeu bezel thi
ring the late mr samuel brown who gave me a whole collect of
cyprian potteri offer to me for ani price i chose to fix but i had
spent all my monei so i said that i would take it home and sell it
for what i could get on hi account i dispos of the ring for ten
guinea to a wellknown dealer who pass it on to the british museum
for twenti guinea afterward i felt sad when on of the great
expert there inform me that it wa the best thing of the sort thei
had secur for mani a dai be it would appear an earli and
exceedingli good copi of some famou work of art by i think
praxitel and the moral of that is as the queen said to alic
never be econom when you see what your instinct tell you is a
good antiqu or you will live to regret your virtuou impuls
also i procur on or two other object which i submit to the
british museum thei said thei were worth keepingand kept them by
wai of exchang kindli present me with plaster cast edg round
with blue paper perhap thei ar better there i like to think so
now it is otherwis except the spearhead alreadi mention on
silver coin of alexand is all my harvest and of thi i found a
better exampl year ago about alexand my friend mr christian
an old resid in the island told me a wondrou and authent tale
some peasant dig found an earthenwar pot and in it nearli a
thousand gold coin for the most part stamp with the head of that
monarch the peasant dispos of them for their weight in gold and
thei were afterward sold by the fortun purchas for seven or
eight pound each where ar thei now i wonder imagin the feel
of the happi man who suddenli discov a pot full of a thousand such
coin as these by the wai i rememb that a ladi onc show me a
magnific necklac made of gold coin of alexand of differ
size which had been given her as a wed present perhap part of
that cyprian find went to make thi necklac but of antiqu i
must stop talk sinc thei mai have more fascin for me than
for my reader
i see that mr hamilton lang in hi book cypru publish in
1878 give a more detail account of the find of thi
treasur
our next expedit wa to the site of ancient curium which is said
by herodotu to have been peopl by argiv to reach thi ruin
citi we pass the tower of colossi and lunch in the policest
of the beauti and fertil villag of episcopi a pleasant place for
picnic thenc we rode on a mile or so to the wast that onc wa
curium through whole row of tomb everi on of which ar said to
have been plunder by the omnivor cesnola in front of us rose a
steep hill upon whose face could be seen more tomb or rock chapel
up thi mount we climb and at the summit came to the ancient citi
as usual it wa noth but a tumbl heap of stone but here the
anemon grew by thousand among them and made the place most
beauti present we found ourselv on the site of a templ the
great column prostrat and broken the fragment of shatter friez
and the bit of mosaic floor reveal by tear up the sod all
told the same unmistak stori of fallen great and a
magnific that time man and earthquak have combin to desol
a littl further on we reach a spot where the ground is liter
strewn with fragment of broken statu some of them almost
lifes but the greater number small i pick up the lower part
of two of these stone statu and put them into myor rather the
zaptieh pocket as i anticip thei make excel
letterweight what a fall off is here the effigi of the god
of oldth feet that were bedew with tear of amor maiden and
of young men anxiou to succe in pirat expedit serv as
the humbl necessari letterweight well perhap it is more
honour than to be broken up to fill the shovel of a cyprian
roadmak
by thi spot is a well or pit which is said to be quit full of these
broken statu probabl thei were thrown here on some occas when
the templ wa sack pick our path on horseback through the
countless stone for twothird of a mile or so we came to anoth
and a larger templ thi wa the great fane dedic to apollo
hylatu a wonder place it must have been when it stood here in it
glori peopl by it attend priest and the crowd of worshipp
flock to it court with gift the situat on that bold highland
brow is superb and must be most splendid of all at dawn when the first
level rai of the sunris sweep it expans doubtless the ancient
place the templ of their sungod here that it might catch hi arrow
while dark yet veil the crowd town below the wide fertil
plain which we call episcopi and the field about the norman tower of
colossicompar to these old column but a mushroom of yesternight
it is not possibl at ani rate to the uninstruct travel with
scant time at hi dispos to follow the exact configur of thi
templ of apollo and it court nor inde if he knew them would
these detail be of ani great assist to the imagin
everywher ar tumbl stone shatter pillar some of them
elegantli wreath overthrown altar and cavern hole in the
depth of which underground cistern and passag becom visibl in
short the cult of the worship of apollo and hi brother and sister
divinitiesalwai except that of venu who is immortali not
more ruin neglect and forlorn than thi unvisit place onc
it splendid sanctuari apollo wa a joyou god but evid he had
hi stern side at ani rate not far awai a headland run out into the
sea and from it precipit bluff those who had offend against hi
majestyor had differ of opinion with hi priestswer hurl
to expiat their crime by a terrifi death at least so sai
tradit
leav the templ of the lost apollo our anim scrambl on through
the stone till at last these ceas and we came to a stretch of
bushclad countri thi is now on of the govern reserv kept
thu to enabl the timber of which the turk denud the island to
spring up again safe from the ravag of man and beast in such
reserv goat ar not allow to graze for of all anim these do
the most damag to young timber which thei gnaw persist until it
perish it is not too much to sai that where there ar mani goat no
forest can aris cypru in bygon ag wa a dens wood land
strabo write in the first year of the christian era sai of it
such then is cypru in point of posit but in excel it
fall behind no on of the island for it is rich in wine and oil
and us homegrown wheat there ar mine of copper in plenti at
tamasso in which ar produc sulphat of copper and
copperrust us in the heal art eratosthen talk of the
plain as be formerli full of wood run to riot choke in fact
with undergrowth and uncultiv the mine were here of some
littl servic the tree be cut down for the melt of copper
and silver and of further help wa shipbuild when men sail
over the sea without fear and with larg fleet but when even so
thei were not got under leav wa given to those who would and
could cut them down to keep the land thei had clear in full
possess and free of tax
ala far differ is the case todai the turk suffer the timber
to be destroi in all save the most inaccess place and the
wast habit of the peasant who if allow will cut up a whole
tree to make a singl sheeptrough complet the ruin so it came
about that at last the land which us to suppli egypt with all the
wood necessari to build her fleet wa almost denud save on the
mountain peak of trooido with the result that the rainfal lessen
alarmingli sinc it advent the british govern ha done it best
to remedi thi state of affair as it ha no monei to spend in
plant it ha adopt anoth and perhap on the whole a more
effect method although the tree have vanish in cypru by the
wonder preserv agenc of natur their seed remain in the
soil and if goat can be kept off the hill where forest stood
forest will again aris thu although to speak of it anticip my
stori a littl it wa with a most real pleasur that in travel
from nicosia to cyrenia i saw the top of great mountain which
fourteen year ago i rememb nake as a plate cover todai with
a thick growth of young fir that must now be fifteen or twenti feet
in height a gener henc and those mountain top will onc more
bear a splendid forest care howev is requir which i do not
think is alwai exercis the newform forest should be thin as
the wise woodman know how to do and the peasant allow the us of
the thin thi would prevent their destroi the tree by
secretli fire the countri either from irrit and spite or to
get the benefit of the young grass which spring up afterward
in thi particular reserv near curium of which i speak howev to
my surpris i saw a flock of sheep and goat in the charg of a herd
on ask how thi came about mr michel the commission for the
limasol district who kindli accompani us and gave us the advantag
of hi knowledg and experi told me that the owner of these
anim claim ancient right of which thei cannot be dispossess
these right endur until the man di or sell hi flock thei ar
howev untransfer nor mai he add to the number of the anim
which he graze thu by degre the matter mend itself
in the midst of thi bushclad plain stand the ancient stadium of
curium where accord to tradit the old inhabit of classic
time celebr their chariot race in consid the place i wa
much puzzl by on detail the cours is about two hundr yard or
six hundr feet long but accord to my rough pace it never
measur more than eightyfour feet at the end where the chariot must
turn i could not understand how three or four vehicl har
with four hors abreast could possibl manag to negoti thi
awkward corner at full speed without more smash than would tend to
the success of the entertain on reflect i am convinc that
chariot race were not run in thi place it ha never i think been
a hippodrom but wa intend sole for athlet game and
footrun to thi supposit it actual measur give
probabl as thei talli veri well with those which were common in
old dai
thi stadium is still singularli perfect it wall be built of
great block of stone which here and there howev must have been
shaken down by earthquak for noth els could have disturb
masonri so solid the visitor can see also where the spectat sat
and in the midst of that desol scrubcov plain it is curiou to
think of the shout thousand gather from curium amathu and
perhap papho who in bygon gener hail the victor in the
game and hoot down the vanquish now the watch mountain
abov the etern sea beneath and the stonering area of their
fierc contest remainnoth more all the rest is loneli and
silenc dust thei were to dust thei have return and onli
wonder memori brood about the place that knew them these relic
of a past which we can fashion forth but dimli seem to come home with
greater vivid to the mind when a travel behold them as on
thi spot in the heart of solitud seen in the centr of citi
that ar still the busi haunt of men thei do not impress us much
so we turn back to limasol ride by anoth road along the
headland which overhang the ocean and paus as i did now and
again to watch the widewing vultur sweep past us on their
neverend journei veri solemn thei look hang there upon
outstretch pinion between the sky and sea as thei hung when the

chapter x
limasol to acherit
hope almost eclips off the italian shore rose again like a star
at limasol for thither came postcard from the brindisi cook sai
that our lost luggag had actual been discov and despatch to
the care of the alexandria cook who would forward it at onc inde
it wa time for on feel howev generousheart mai be the
lender that it is possibl to wear out a welcom to a borrow
dresssuit the flora came in we rush to meet her but nobodi on
board had even heard about our luggag then follow expens cabl
and in due cours a fate answer from the delud alexandria cook
cypru quarantin restrict forbid shipment
i confess that at thi point i nearli gave wai but recov
commenc the studi of the maritim regul of cypru to be
reward by discov that the import of rag and worn
cloth wa prohibit until further notic the worn cloth
refer to i mai explain ar the castoff garment that have clad
the pilgrim to mecca or the donkei boi of cairo appli in ani
other sens no travel or inhabit could appear in a present
condit on the island sinc that which thei carri on their back
would be worn cloth yet such is the inexor stupid of
offici in the east thu wa the clausenon too clearli draft
i admitrend by i know not whom in alexandria
then follow more telegram letter of mingl threat and entreati
and so forth till mani dai afterward at length the luggag
reappear and with it a veri pretti bill the matter seem small
even laughabl when written down in afterdai but at the time it wa
troublesom enough especi as the remot place of the earth ar
just where a visitor must dress most carefulli
on the termin of our stai at limasol our plan wa to go by sea
to papho forti mile awai where our mule would meet us thenc to
ride to lymni where an enterpris english syndic is attempt to
reopen the old phoenician copper mine and lastli by pyrga and lefka
to the capit nicosia in all about five dai hard travel for
the most part over mountain
as the time of departur drew near mighti and exhaust were the
prepar pack is alwai a task as labori to the mind as to
the bodi but when it mean think out what is to go on the mule
what to go to nicosia what to the final port of departur what to be
thrown awai as too cumbersom to carri and what must be kept with the
travel at all hazard in the veri probabl event of these variou
parcel and belong vanish awai to be seen no more then
posit geniu and geniu of a peculiar sort is requir to deal with
the emerg of the situat howev at last cabbag that is
the mulet depart with hi anim on which were laden campb
kettl pound of tea candl and i know not what besid with
instruct to await our arriv at papho the dai pass on and it
wa announc that the flora wa onc more in sight
we went to the offic and it wa suggest that i should take the
ticket now papho is a harbour where the voyag can onli land in
fine weather whenc too if it be not fine he is carri on to
egypt where he must wait until the unweari flora again begin
her weekli round as it happen in the cours of my life i have had
some experi of remot place where on cannot land or embark
inde a mishap which onc i met with at on of these in a far countri
entail upon me a consider risk of be drown a larg
expenditur of cash some anxieti of mind and a five dai journei in
a railwai train but although it is rather interest i will not
tell the tale in these page
i suppos i said to the agent that we shall be abl to land at
papho
oh i think so he repli casual whereon i intim that i
would wait to take the ticket till the boat came in
in time on learn to put a veri exact valu on the i think so of a
ship agent in thi instanc it assur me that there wa not a
chanc of our visit the templ of venu on the morrow
the flora came in and with her my friend mr charl christian who
wa kindli go to conduct us upon our tour
shall we be abl to land at papho i shout
he shook hi head all the agent sai we can he said but the
captain and the boatmen sai we cant
then resignedli i suggest that we had better give it up sinc i
could not face the risk of make an involuntari trip back to egypt
mr christian agre and it wa given up though with great regret a
messag be despatch to cabbag to travel with hi mule to
nicosia
it wa a true disappoint to me thu on my second visit to the
island as on my first to be prevent from visit the veri home of
aphrodit the place that the goddess chose to set her foot when she
rose from the foam of the sea not that there is as i understand
much more to be seen at either old or new paphospaleopapho and
neopapho thei ar six or eight mile apartthan among the ruin of
other ancient citi in the island still i wish to look upon the
place where st paul onc reason with sergiu paulu the deputi
what a spectacl even for those ancient shore of chittim that have
wit so mani thingsth mighti apostl befor the gate of the
wanton shrine of venu thunder denunci at the wizard elyma
and smite him to dark with the sword of the wrath of god i
desir to have stood upon that road which as strabo tell us wa
crowd year by year with men and women votari who journei to thi
more ancient shrine from all the town of cypru and inde from
everi citi of the known world i desir also to have seen the tumbl
wreck of the templ that sacr enclosur which perrot and chipiez
recreat so vividli and well that as i cannot better them i will
quot their word where
everyth spoke to the sens the air wa full of perfum of
soft and caress sound the murmur of fall water the song
of the nightingal and the voluptu coo of the dove mingl
with the rippl note of the flute the instrument which sound
the call to pleasur or led the bride and bridegroom to to the
wed feast under tent or light shelter built of branch
skilfulli interlac dwelt the slave of the goddess those who
were call by pindaru in the scoliast compos for theoxeniu of
corinth the servant of the persuas these ar greek or
syrian girl cover with jewel and dress in rich stuff with
brightcolour fring their black and glossi tress were
twist up in mitra or scarv of brilliant colour with
natur flower such as pink rose and pomegran blossom
hung over their forehead their ey glitter under the arch of
wide eyebrow made still wider by art the fresh of their lip
and cheek wa highlight by carmin necklac of gold amber
and glass hung between their swell breast with the pigeon
the emblem of fertil in on hand and a flower or
myrtlebranch in the other these women sat and wait
but aphrodit wa against me who serv thoth a foreign egyptian god
with whom she had naught in common and doubtless did not admir
sinceexcept in ladi collegeslearn doe not consort with
loveli so her shrine remain and will remain unvisit by me i
regret also not be abl to examin the copperwork of the
ancient at lymni with the vast pit whenc the or wa dug the
mountain of slag that lie around and the tunnel hundr of yard
long which the geniu and persever of the men of our gener
have burrow through the solid rock with a lake of water abov their
head in search of the lode which is wait somewher to make the
fortun of those who find it last of all and most of all perhap
wa i sorri not to see the beauti stretch of mountain countri which
li in thi part of the island
although the main lode is not yet discov sinc the abov wa
written extens deposit of copper or have been struck at
lymni
yet it is well that we did not attempt the adventur travel
overland as for a while we contempl for immedi thereaft
it came on to rain and rain for dai now a journei on muleback over
the roadless cyprian hill in rain is not a thing to be lightli
undertaken the path ar slipperi and in place danger but worst
of all is the continu wet which wrap himself as he will in
macintosh soak baggag and travel if he could dry himself and
hi belong at the end of the dai thi would matter littl but
here come the troubl the fire made of wild thyme or what not that
suffic to cook hi food in a policest or a tent will not draw
the moistur from hi cloth or blanket so he must sleep wet and
unless the sun shine which in these season it often doe not do for
dai togeth start on wet next morn in ani countri thi is
riski in cypru it is danger for here as all resid in the
land know a soak and a subsequ chill probabl breed fever
i mai add that certain passeng poohpooh doubt went on by the
flora to papho to find themselv in due cours in egypt whenc
thei return ten dai or so later on gentlemen mr mavrogordato
inde did succe in land but from anoth steamer when the
papho boatmen learn by signal or otherwis that he wa on board
thi ship which as i understand have cargo to discharg roll
off the port for dai thei clad themselv in lifebelt and made an
effort with the result that ultim he wa land also in a
lifebelt and littl els the journei i gather wa riski but there
come a time when most of us would rather take the chanc of be
drown than after a prolong involuntari tour return miser and
humili to the place of start
at length came the ev of our departur from limasol not for papho
but for famagusta vi larnaca and acherit in the afternoon we went
for a walk and gather mani wild flower and as the sun set i betook
myself to stroll upon the jetti it wa a calm even and the solemn
hush which pervad the golden sky and the sea still heav with
recent storm made the place love some brutal boi were try to
drown a cat but to my delight the poor creatur escap them and
scrambl along the rough plank to the shore thei follow it into
the town and i wa left alon there listen to the water lap
against the pier and watch an old fisherman in a fez sit still
as a statu hi line between hi finger he did not seem to belong
to the nineteenth centuri he might have live and doubtless in the
person of hi progenitor did live on or two or three or four
thousand year ago i smoke my cigarett and contempl him half
expect that present he would draw out a brass bottl as wa the
fortun of fishermen in the arabian night and thenc unlock a
jinn but the brass bottl would not bite nor the fish either
somehow it remind me of anoth scenea littl pier that run out
into the ici water of the north sea at reykiavik whenc on such an
ev as thi i rememb see a boi angl for the flat fish that lie
in the yellow sand onli here in cypru were no eiderduck and there
in iceland rose no minaret or palm
i do not suppos that i shall see limasol again but thu while memori
remain i wish ever to recal it with it twilight still it
illimit darkl ocean it quaint eastern street and build
and over all of them and the mountain beyond a gloriou golden pall
of sunset
on a certain sundayeverybodi seem to travel upon the sabbath in
cyprusth three of us my nephew mr christian and myself start
in a rattletrap carriag drag by four scaffold of poni on
of which wa dead lame for larnaca about fortyf mile awai
there were mani agit about thi departur first of all arriv
a sulkylook greek who declar that the carriag could not take
the luggag and refus to allow it to be load thi wa rather
gratuit on hi part as it seem that he had no interest in the
convey except some possibl unearn commiss then it wa
doubt whether the deadlam hors could go at all but after a nail
had been extract from hi bleed frog he wa pronounc to be not
onli fit but eager for the journei at thi season of the year it is
customari in cypru to turn the hors and mule on to green barlei
for three week whenc thei arriv fat and wellseem thi is why
all draught anim were then so hard to hire
at length with mani farewel we creak off through the narrow
street and difficult turn of limasol to find ourselv present
in the open countri here among the spring corn i saw white thorn
in bloom though i think that their speci differ slightli from our
own also mani carobtre some of them in the warmer situat now
begin to form their pod
tree by the wai do not as a rule belong to the owner of the soil
if you bui a piec of land in cypru it will be to find that the
timber on it is the law possess of somebodi els with all
right and easement thereto pertain these must be purchas
separ a fact that make the possess of properti under the
prevail turkish law a somewhat complic and vexati affair
i notic that at the extrem of the bough mani of these carob
especi in the case of old specimen were disfigur by bunch of
red and rusti leav on inquir the reason mr christian inform
me that the harm is due to the ravag of rat which live in the
hollow bole and gnaw the juici bark of the young shoot sometim
thei destroi the entir tree but the cypriot ar too idl to kill
them out thei prefer to lose their crop the goat too damag
everyth that thei can reach and show extraordinari ingenu in
their effort to secur the food thei love thu with my own ey i
saw a coupl of these intellig anim rear up upon their
hindleg their forefeet prop togeth in midair for mutual
support their beard head outstretch to pluck the succul
shoot abov the group thu form would have furnish an admir
subject for a sculptor but i have never seen it repres in ani
work of art ancient or modern perhap it is too difficult for easi
treatment or it mai be of rare occurr on of the method by
which cyprian peasant aveng injuri upon each other is to attempt
to destroi the olivetre of an offend neighbour by cut the
bark with knive some of the oliv which we pass upon thi journei
were disfigur with curiou wartlik growth upon their ancient
bole which mr christian inform me as he believ had been
produc by such act of petti malic practis perhap hundr of
year ago in these instanc of cours the tree had ultim
recov
the countri through which we pass wa on the whole veri desol
although a good deal of the land seem to be under cultiv of a
kind we saw few villag these i suppos lai hidden behind the
hill but in truth the popul is scant differ inde must it
have been in the dai of the roman occup then there were enough
peopl in cypru to enabl the jew who had settl there to put two
hundr and forti thousand to the sword in the cours of a singl
revolt that is a hundr thousand more than the present popul
of the island
after we had driven for nearli five hour and beguil the tedium of
the road by lunch in the carriag we came to a halfwai hous or
hovel call chirokitia ie kitia of the pig although it look
somewhat dreari in the rain which fell from time to time it wa a
prettili situat place hillsurround front a bold brown
mountain which lai between it and the sea and stand over a green
and fertil bottom with olivegarden and figtre through which a
torrent brawl the inn itself if such it can be call had a
littl verandah reach by extern step half ladder and half
staircas from thi verandah we enter the guestroom which wa
whitewash and scribbl over with write in english turkish
greek and french with draw also wherebi longdepart travel
had solac the weari hour of their stai thi room wa stonepav
and furnish with a tabl a bench a bed and some rushbottom
chair here the mistress of the resthous the mother of sever
pretti littl girl who were stand about in the mud rag and
bootless present arriv with refresh a sort of cream chees
that is eaten with sugar and tini cup of sweet turkish coffe
accompani by glass of water with which to wash it down
mr christian ask me how old i thought thi good woman might be i
repli nearli sixti and inde she look it he said that she wa
about twentysix and that he rememb her not mani year ago as a
pretti girl sinc that time howev she had present the world
with an infant regularli onc a year and her present weari wornout
aspect wa the result
you shouldnt have so mani children said mr christian to her in
greek
god send them she answer with a sad littl smile
thi poor woman with anoth of her familiar troubl close at hand
wa in the unhappi posit of be separ from her husband now
do time under the care of mr mavrogordato she told us that he
had come into thi misfortun on the fals evid of the keeper of a
rival resthous some few hundr yard awai the onli other dwell
in the place inde as to our hous and the owner there wa a sad
and if true a cruel tale of how it host he of the jail seek to
better hi fortun had put up a mill upon a piec of land at the back
of the dwell how the rival had wait until the mill wa erect
and then claim the land and variou other oppress and
distress which result in assault fals evid and for on of
them a term of retir mr christian told me that the stori wa
accur in the main and ad that out of such quarrel as these
come most of the frequent cyprian murder it is quit like that the
injur man will emerg from jail onli to lie up behind a wall with a
load gun thenc in due cours to return to the care of mr
mavrogordato steep in the shadow of a graver charg
the scene from the verandah at least while it rain wa not much
more cheer than the stori of our hostess to the right lai a littl
patch of garden with noth particular grow in it surround by
an untidi fenc of dead thorn behind thi were filthi shed and
stabl in on of which kneel halfadozen angrylook camel
great brown heap with leg doubl under them show their ugli
hockjoint the saddl were on their back but the load lai besid
them and rest against these repos their driver smoke
motleygarb men with colour headdress halfcap halfturban
who stare at the wretch weather in silenc in front of the hous a
pair of gees were waddl in the mud while a halfstarv cat
crouch against the wall and mew incessantli present we had a
littl welcom excit for along the road came a turk mount on a
donkei he wa follow by three wive also mount on donkei on or
two of them bear infant and shroud head to foot from the vulgar
gaze of the infidel in yashmak and white robe that in such chilli
weather must be somewhat cheerless wear thei pass chatter and
argu their poor beast pile up behind the saddl with what
look like and i believ were featherb for whatev els these
peopl leav behind thei like to take their mattress then the
prospect wa empti again save for the groan camel the gees the
thin cat and the pretti littl rag girl who stood about and
stare at noth
weari of these delight after an hour and a half or so as the rain
had stop at length i went for a walk along the edg of the stream
which look as though trout would flourish there did it not dry up
in summer here grow among the grass i found sever beauti
flower ranunculi anemon and other that were strang to me also
i note our english friend chaffinch and sparrow look exactli
as thei do at home onli somewhat paler as is the case with almost
everi other bird i saw i suppos that the hot sun bleach them on
sparrow that i saw fly about wa pure white and the lark of which
there ar two varieti crest and common ar almost dustcolour
by the wai these lark never soar like their english cousin
at length the poor screw be rest or a littl less tire we
resum our journei travel for some distanc through hill what a
piti it is that it doe not pleas the war offic to make cypru a
halfwai hous for troop on their road to india where thei might
grow accustom to a warm climat without run ani particular risk
to health also there would be other advantag the great lesson of
the present war in africa is the valu of mount infantri who can
shoot think for themselv and ride over rough countri what a
trainingground cypru would afford to such troop as these there ar
hors and perhap the best mule in the world in plenti the countri
is wild and mountain and noth would be hurt in manoeuvr men
moreov everi conceiv physic difficulti can be found here and
dealt with for practic as occas mai requir there is heat there
is cold there ar drought and rain flood torrent to be bridg
and precipic to be climb forest to take cover in and plain to
scout over besid mani more advantag such as would appeal to a
command anxiou to educ hi armi to the art of war in rough
countri
why then doe not the govern alwai keep a garrison of sai five or
ten thousand mount men manoeuvr through the length and breadth of
cypru thi would assist the island and produc a forc that ought to
be absolut invalu in time of war also the place be so
cheap the cost would be moder i give the suggest for what it
is worth
it wa past nine at night when at last we crawl into larnaca the
journei have taken three hour longer than it should have done ow
to the weak of our miser hors next morn we start for
acherit near to famagusta where we were to be the guest of messr
christian who ar now complet their contract for the great
drainag work and reservoir which have been undertaken by the
govern of cypru with monei advanc by the british treasuri of
these i shall have someth to sai in their place
leav larnaca in a high wind for the first few mile we pass
through a veri grei and desol part of the island have the sea on
our right and flat swampi land upon our left strike inland we
halt for a few minut to look at a curiou stone tower of the
lusignan period in appear not unlik a small colossi which
rais it frown wall among the dirti mud dwell of a
dilapid povertystricken turkish villag there is noth
remark about the build which is now tenant onli by goat and
pigeon except it ag doubtless it wa onc the stronghold of some
petti nobl built for refug in time of danger afterward we came
to a place pergamo where stood some desertedlook hut out of
on of which ran a larg roughhair dog
that dog is all that is left of the dukobortzi wa mr christian
cryptic remark
i inquir who or what the dukobortzi might be and learn that thei
ar a sect of vegetarian quaker from the caucasu distinguish from
their countrymen and inde the rest of mankind by variou
peculiar thu thei have no marriag ceremoni all their earn
go into a common fund and whole famili of them sleep in a singl
room on of the chief articl of their faith howev is a horror
of kill thi it wa that brought them into conflict with the
russian govern who persecut them mercilessli becaus be men
of peac thei refus to serv in the armi in the end the english
societi of friend export them settl two thousand or so in
cypru and anoth three thousand in canada a place less suit to
thi purpos than pergamo could scarc be found in the whole
island to begin with the dukobortzi ar vegetarian and the land
be here unirrig will onli grow veget for about half the
year also the climat of the local which is veri hot wa not at
all congeni to emigr from the caucasu with a perfect passion
for overcrowd at night so the poor peopl sicken rapidli and a
consider number di some of them went to labour at the
irrig work but were quit unabl to bear the sun then thei
tri work at night and rest dure the heat but still it did
not agre with them in the end thei were help to join their
coreligionist in canada and now all that remain of them is the
roughhair russian dog which must feel veri lone thei were it
seem in most respect an estim peopl gentl and kindli but
clearli thi wa no promis land for them
cypru seem to be a favourit dumpingground for philanthropist who
wish to better commun that cannot flourish elsewher i rememb
that when i wa last in the island some wellintent person had
forward thither a motlei assort of whitechapel jew who were
expect to turn their old hat into shovel and becom raiser of
agricultur produc upon land that had been provid for the
purpos needless to sai thei entir refus to cultiv the said
land the unfortun commission of the district had been place in
charg of them and never shall i forget hi tale of woe he furnish
them with implement but thei would not plough with seed but thei
declin to sow as the charit societi in england wa endow
them with sixpenc a head per diem and food is cheap in cypru
thing went on thu until the fund dri up then the commission
descend full of wrath and interview the head of the settlement
who met him as he told me clad in a tall black hat and adorn with
lavend kid glove much argument follow till at last the
exasper commission exclaim
well you must either work or starv will you work
the kidglov repres shook hi head and murmur no
will you starv ask the commission
again the answer wa a gentl but decid no
then what the devil will you do shout the enrag offici
we will telegraph to the lord mayor of london repli the
repres suav in fact sir we have alreadi telegraph
the end of the matter wa that the member of the commun dispers
to the coast of syria where when last heard of thei were
understood to be do well in more congeni line the whitechapel
jew ha no agricultur lean he prefer to till some richer
field
leav pergamo we cross an enorm stoni plain that is name
after it thi tract of countri there is no doubt would grow certain
class of timber veri well and within twenti year of it plant
produc a larg revenu unfortun howev the govern ha no
monei to devot to the experi and privat capit is want
next we came to the pretti villag of kouklia and pass the recent
finish dam enclos an area of two squar mile now for the first
time fill up with water then we began to travel round the great
basin of the acherit reservoir which when finish is to includ
forti squar mile most of which will be under water dure the
winter season it is destin to irrig the lower part of the
messaoria plain which compris leagu upon leagu of some of the
most fertil soil in the world on our wai we came to a stoni pass in
the neck of two small hill where i notic that everi rock wa
score with rude cross it appear that some year ago frequent
complaint were receiv by the ecclesiast author to the
effect that thi place wa badli and persist haunt the ghost
be of a violent and aggress order given to salli forth at
night with uncanni shout and leap to the great disturb of
peaceabl travel on the highwai feel that thi thing must be
dealt with everi avail priest and bishop assembl and curs
and exorcis those ghost by all law and effici mean stamp
them moral flat and abolish them so that from that dai to thi
not on of them ha been heard or seen to make their triumph sure and
last the holi men cut and paint these cross upon the rock with
the result that no real troll of dubiou origin can now stop there
for a moment
at length we saw the hous that the messr christian have built to
live in while the work ar in progress it is splendidli place upon
a bluff overlook the great plain and from a distanc i know not
why ha the appear of a small ruin templ veri glad were we to
reach it about three oclock in the afternoon and partak of a lamb
roast whole in the cyprian fashion with other luxuri
just below thi hous start the six mile of massiv dam that run
across the plain to form the retain wall of the vast bodi of water
which is to be held up as yet thi water is allow to escap but
next winter when the dam is complet it will be save and let out
for purpos of irrig there is noth new in the world in the
cours of the build of the dam were discov the remain of on
more ancient also run across the plain but enclos a smaller
area inde it sluic is to be press into the servic of the
present gener i examin it and came to the conclus that the
masonri is of the roman period mr j h medlicott of the indian
irrig depart the veri abl engin who ha design these
great work and carri them out so successfulli is howev of
opinion that it is venetian probabl he is right thi at least is
clear that peopl in dai long dead could plan and execut such
enterpris as well as we do todai roman or venetian the stonework
is admir laid and bound togeth with some of the hardest and best
cement that ever i saw
the messr christian who have contract to complet thi
undertak emploi about three thousand men and women mostli on a
system of piecework in the even i walk along the great dam and
saw them labour like ant there and in the trench which ar to
distribut the water thei were then engag in face the dam with
stone which is fit togeth but not mortar carri up great
block upon their back and lai them in place under the direct
of overs at first the provis of thi face stone wa
difficult and expens as the stuff had to be cart six or seven
mile inde it cost threaten to swallow up most of the
contractor profit then it wa that within half a mile of the
place where the materi wa need veri luckili mr charl
christian in the cours of an even walk discov an outcrop of
excel stone soft to work but with the properti of harden in
water the cutter get it out by a simpl but effect system no
doubt that which ha been follow by their ancestor for thousand of
year a skill man can loosen a great number of suitabl block in a
dai appar with eas when i tri it howev i found the task
somewhat beyond me
from the strong resembl of the materi i believ that thi wa
the veri stone us by the builder of the ancient dam below the
hous doubtless thei discov the quarri as mr christian did
although oddli enough the nativ who had live in the neighbourhood
all their live declar that noth of the sort exist for mile
around it wa the old case of ey and no ey
i said some page back that live in cypru is cheap and of thi
here i had an instanc the hous put up by messr christian for
their conveni while direct the work is spaciou twostorei
and capit built of stone with if i rememb right a kind of mud
roof laid upon rafter cover with split cane mat properli made and
attend to such roof last for year the whole cost of the
build which wa quit larg enough to accommod with comfort
seven or eight peopl and servant wa less than 300 includ the
larg verandah in england it would cost at the veri least a
thousand and probabl a great deal more
chapter xi
famagusta
that night a great gale blew roar round the hous as though we had
been in coll or at kessingland instead of southern cypru in the
morn the wind had drop but the sky wa heavi with
ominouslook raincloud float here and there in the blue deep
after breakfast we mount the poni that had been provid for us a
bless chang from the familiar mule and set out to explor the
messaoria plain and the kouklia dam thi magnific plain which
vari in breadth from ten to twenti mile run practic the whole
length of the bodi of the island from famagusta on the east to morphu
on the west that is a distanc of about fiftyf mile onc it
wa a dens forest now it is open level countri cultiv here and
there but for the most part barren on either side of it north and
south stretch the two rang of cyprian mountain that of kyrenia
and that of trooido and it is the decompos basicign rock
brought down from these mountain in the winterflood by the river
pidia and other torrent that form the soil of the plain
what a soil it is deep brown in colour of an unknown thicknessit
ha been prove to fifti feetand i suppos as rich and product as
ani in the world hitherto or at ani rate sinc the venetian dai
two natur accid howev have made it compar valueless
that of drought and that of flood the greater part of thi end of
the plain which i am now describ for instanc ha been a swamp in
winter and an arid wilder in summer it is to remedi thi state of
thing that the irrig dam have been construct to hold up the
water in winter and pour their lifegiv stream forth again in
summer
in the futur all of thi vast area of land or thousand of acr of
it that will fall under their influenc ought to produc the most
enorm crop on thi point i see onli on fear upon the top
surfac of the soil and in place go a foot or two into it ar
littl vein of white salti substanc deposit i suppos from the
flood these mai make the surfac earth sour and until thei ar
evapor affect the health of crop i know that the same thing
happen in coll in the hebrid where newdrain land have to be
treat i think with lime in order to sweeten them it is my belief
that here howev on or two deep plough and the exposur of the
earth to the scorch heat of a cyprian summer would do thi work
effect i have suggest to mr christian that he should cut out
a block or block of soil to the depth of three feet enclos them as
thei stand in box with the natur veget grow on the top
and ship them to me thi he ha promis to do and i shall then
submit them for analysi to the chemist of the royal agricultur
societi to which i belong who will doubtless be abl to advis as to
the natur and power of the salt and to sai what method should be
adopt to be rid of them
now when flood is prevent and water will be avail for
irrig it seem to me that upon the messaoria if anywher on the
earth farm ought to pai i can imagin no more interest and as
i believ profit experi than to take up let us sai five
thousand acr of thi area upon easi term such as no doubt the
govern would grant pai it price for exampl by a certain
tith of the profit of the produc termin in a certain number of
year thi land might then be farm by the process simpl where
labour is so cheap of make rais roadwai to divid it into block
with an irrig ditch at the foot of each along which roadwai a
pair of steam plough could travel cultiv the expans between
consid the advantag an inexhaust soil which the silt from the
irrig water would go far toward manur if inde with an
occasion fallow other manur is necessari field that can
whenev need be absolut cleans of weed and rubbish by
plough and lai them dry for a few month in the fierc summer
sun which kill everi root and seed a great varieti of possibl crop
from cotton down whereof veri often two could be taken in success
in a singl season for instanc wheat or barlei to be harvest about
mai follow by maiz to be harvest in autumn a port famagusta
within seven or eight mile and a splendid market for most product
at port said and for the barlei in england where it is much in
request among brewer on account of it saccharin and golden
bright a district where the ordinari cattl and hors sick
seem to be unknown except for anthrax which can be avoid with
common care where moreov oxen and sheep fatten marvel upon
grass lucern and the carob bean of the countri and meet with a
readi sale at good price in egypt such ar some of the most obviou
merit of thi neglect plain ad to which must be the ampl
suppli of veri inexpens and fairli intellig labour
of cours there ar drawback also or the place would be a paradis
to begin with it is veri hot in summer when european must be care
about expos themselv to the sun although thi heat is gener
temper by the wind blow up from the sea which is near at hand
next the messaoria plain ha a reput for fever person i
believ thi to be exagger as is shown by the fact that among the
three thousand men women and children emploi by the messr
christian the number of casualti from sick ha been veri small
inde and thi although thei frequent sleep in the trench of
newlyturn earth at all season of the year the doctor an
armenian who from hi appear and speech i took to be a scotchman
and a gentleman who seem to understand hi busi veri thoroughli
told me howev that occasion thei had case result for the
most part from the us of the swamp water of a horribl and sometim
fatal ailment which he call marbl fever thi sick is i
believ known by the same name in part of central and south america
suffer from it feel ici cold with an exterior temperatur that
sink a good deal below normal wherea the interior temperatur is
105 or 106 the symptom ar those of congest i think of the
bloodvessel and inde congest is found on necropsi also there
ar other fever but the doctor said that thei were not common and
that the gener health wa good
for a long while befor their hous wa built the messr christian
mr medlicott and their variou english assist live as best thei
could in nativ hut or tent yet i think i am right in sai that
dure the two year or so while the work have been in progress none
of them have suffer from seriou ill although the natur of
their occup prevent them from refug from the summer heat for
the accustom three month on trooido thi fact speak for itself
and on the whole i inclin to the belief that with ordinari care and
precaut healthi resid and pure waterboil for
preferenceadult european of temper habit would have littl to
fear from the climat of the messaoria plain there is howev a
danger i have mention befor which cannot alwai be avoid that of
a soak follow by a chill produc fever thi must be risk
after all it is not uncommon in hot countri
anoth drawback is that to prove success such farm must be
under absolut honest and intellig supervis the casual
compani manag despatch from england would in eight case out of
ten bring it to financi grief the farmer should live on the spot
give hi own constant care to everi oper otherwis those
interest in the ventur would be certain to hear from time to time
that thi or that crop had fail what thei would not hear is that
the overs had neglect to irrig the cotton or whatev the
crop might be and thu destroi the prospect for the year becaus
he wa awai on a holidai at nicosia or perchanc had taken a trip to
egypt leav a nativ in charg but thi necess for the ey of
the owner or faith steward hold good of everi busi in all
part of the world the farmer foot is the best manur run the
old agricultur saw
to sum the matter up although be a farmer and understand
someth of the question i should like to dwell upon it at greater
length i can onli sai that if i were a young man own or with the
command of 10000 capit noth would pleas me better than to
make such an experi upon the irrig portion of the messaoria
near to the kouklia dam for choic i believ that given health and
strength i should return thenc in fifteen year or so with no need
to farm anyth except the fortun i had acquir
inde it is sad to see so much wealth agricultur and other ly
ungarn in cypru while million of pound of english capit as
mani of us know to our cost ar squander in speciou wildcat
scheme at the veri end of the earth were the island in the heart of
west africa or china for instanc compani would be form to
exploit it and in due cours lose their monei and the live of their
manag but as it is onli a british possess close at hand nobodi
will troubl
the great cry of cypru is for capit whatev mai be the fate of
the present coppermin ventur at lymni there is no doubt that
with enough monei the old lode could be discov the same thing
appli to the other copper area the ancient could not mine deep
the metal must be there and now as of old to the valu of sum
uncount yet nobodi will even put down a borehol to look for the
deposit in convers i ventur to suggest to the governor sir
william haynessmith that the govern should do thi on their own
account sinc if onc thei prove the mine thei could make handsom
term with the compani which would come forward to work them the
answer wa we have no monei the turkish tribut take all our
monei
thi is true everi year the british taxpay is inform that a grant
of 30000 ha been made in aid of the revenu of cypru he is not
inform that never a penni of that 30000 come to cypru that on
the contrari cypru ha a surplu of revenu over expenditur even
in it present starv condit of more than 60000 a year thi
60000 is taken nomin toward pai the tribut of 93800 per
annum promis to the turk when we took over the island the 30000
annual grant by parliament ostens in aid of the revenu of
cypru goe to make up the balanc which cannot be wrung from the
island butand here is the pointthat monei is never seen at
constantinopl it stop in the british treasuri in 1855 a loan of i
forget how much rais by turkei wa jointli guarante by franc
and england needless to sai under these circumst turkei doe
not troubl to pai the bondhold their interest neither doe franc
pai as a jointguarantor why i know not but probabl becaus we ar
afraid to ask her so john bull pai what is more he wa trick
the revenu receiv by the port from cypru wa assess at doubl
it actual amount also he pai four per cent wherea at the present
rate of monei on the credit of the british empir the loan could
easili be convert to on or two and a half or three per cent if
thi were done practic it would eas cypru of it tribut and
make it a most prosper coloni but to do it doe not pleas the
treasuryprob it would involv a good deal of troubl so year by
year we hear of a grant of 30000 in aid of the revenu of a
possess which ha an annual surplu of 60000 that might with
assist and forethought as i believ firmli within a singl
gener be multipli into a surplu of 600000 further the
turkish tribut might be capitalis inde to do our govern
justic i believ that effort hitherto unsuccess have been made
in that direct but as yet noth happen
anoth possibl sourc of wealth in cypru as i suggest with
refer to the pergamo plain li in the judici plant of
valuabl timber which as the histori of the island show would grow
here like weed upon land that is practic useless for other
purpos i must instanc on more that of the wine industri that
cypru produc excel vintag in the past is prove by
historyth ptolemi all got tipsi on them especi if i
rememb right ptolemi aulet ptolemi the piper to thi dai
inde although it is so ill prepar the wine is good mavro is a
strong black rather rough wine but i prefer the lighter white
varieti which we drank at limasol then there is the vintag call
commanderia famou in the crusad time and produc upon certain
mountain onli thi is of the madeira class nutti in flavour and
veri sweet more of a liqueur than anyth els inde when the
madeira vine were kill out by diseas that island wa replant i
believ from the commanderia stock the origin vine it wa said
have come from cypru at kyrenia our kind host mr tyzer the
judg gave us some commandera to drink which an old woman had brought
round in a wineskinsh onli made a few gallon from a patch of
vinesand sold to him at a price of about twopenc a bottl to my
fanci it wa a wonder wine but perhap i am no judg of such
matter other specimen which i tast struck me as headi and cloi
to the palat thi is certain howev that if the cultiv wa
carri out upon a proper system a vintag could be produc that
now as of old would command a high price here again is room for
enterpris and capit
to return to our expedit we rode for mile across the great plain
with the beauti peak of the mountain show in bold outlin
against the sky to our right all the wai we follow wide dyke in
cours of be delv out of the rich soil to carri the water that
ar to be store behind the dam in these dyke hundr of cypriot
were at work most of them christian but some if i rememb right
turkish men and women labour togeth here by the piec thu on
might see a man and hi wife hi son and daughter engag in
scoop out their allot task which had been alreadi carefulli
measur and peg thei all seem veri goodhumour and much chaff
went on between them and their employ mr charl christian
becaus of the nonarriv of the watercart upon which thei reli for
refresh at their thirsti toil thei were dy of drought thei
declar and he would have to send to buri them whereupon he repli
that it wa for the good of their health to make them thinner and so
forth
at length follow the endless dyke and observ mani thing by the
wai such as the charact of the grass we came to the complet
kouklia dam a splendid work on the further side of which the water
ar now gather for the first time it is curiou to see how soon
the wild duck have found out thi new and excel home where whole
flock of these beauti bird now swim peacefulli keep
themselv howev well out of gunshot thenc we turn homeward
across the wide dreari plain that as i hope within the next ten year
will be rich with luxuri crop inde thi undertak ha alreadi
so greatli advantag the peasant that as i hear sinc i left the
island after their simpl fashion thei put up prayer in the church
implor that everi bless mai fall upon the head of messr
charl and perci christian thei ought also to prai for mr
chamberlain who might on occas be glad of such spiritu
assist whatev mai be said against that statesman thi at least
is true he is the best coloni minist that we have had for mani a
long year a busi man himself he understand more or less and to
a certain extent can sympathis with the need and aspir of the
undevelop countri in hi charg to him and no on els it is due
that the spell of consist neglect ha been broken and the small sum
of 60000 necessari for the carri out of these work ha been
advanc to cypru
on our return we were overtaken by a heavi thunder rain and soak
unfortun although the hous wa quit close to us we could not
gallop home sinc the downpour made the clai soil so slipperi that to
do so would have been to risk a fall therefor we were oblig to
walk our hors and get wet as a chang wa at hand howev in thi
instanc the duck did not matter
toward even we start on a sport expedit so at last the
gun that i rescu from the custom with such troubl wa of us we
had hope for some woodcockshoot among the scrub on the hillsid
but it wa so late in the season that enough bird were not left to
make it worth while to go after them the duck remain howev and
to these we devot our attent
the place where we were to station ourselv wa three or four mile
awai a ridg of rock between two lake over which the wildfowl
flight at sunset i wa ask if i would walk or ride and gaili
declar in favour of walk befor i got back i wa sorri for my
choic we wade through swamp we scrambl along an ancient
causewai built of block of stone mani of them miss and over a
slope of rough ground to the appoint ridg where we took up our
post four of us at a distanc of about two hundr yard from each
other it wa a lone and beauti spot set in the bow of the hill
like the section of an amphitheatr it vast open circu ly behind
us in front look toward the sea and anoth lake whenc the duck
were to come lai a desert plain cover with low scrub across which
the fresh wind whistl abov wa a stormi heaven splendid to look
at but not favour for fowlshoot sinc the heavi cloud
blot out the light what is want on these occas is a clear
sky mark with light fleeci cloud for against these it is easi to
see the bird as thei sweep toward the gun
i took my place sit on on rock and lai my cartridg readi
upon anoth over which my head project wrap myself up also in
a coat which i had brought with me for now the air felt veri damp and
cold especi after our arduou trudg for a long while noth
happen and i wa left in the midst of the intens silenc to examin
the drear sceneri the ancient rock worn and hollow by aeon of
weather and the flower and grass which grew about me the sun set
the sky darken and darken the black mass of cloud seem to
domin the earth at last i heard a sound of whistl wing and
about a hundr yard to my right i saw a flight of duck their long
neck extend shoot past me like arrow and vanish then came
anoth flight sixti yard off or more at which i ventur a useless
shot that echo strang along the stoni ridg now the night fell
rapidli like someth tangibl on littl lot of fowl pass in
front of me within forti yard and of these i manag to see and bag
the last which fell with a heavi thud fifti yard or more from where
it had di in air after thi it wa hopeless the duck had been
disturb too late by the beater sent to flush them in the pass
toward the sea
on thei came in thousand and ten of thousand the air wa full of
the rush of their wing and the earth echo with their differ
criesth deep note of gees the unearthli call of curlew and the
whistl pipe of teal sometim thei seem to pass so close to me
that thei nearli struck my head but against the black cloud noth
wa visibl except a brown line that vanish almost befor it wa
seen i fire wildli and onc or twice heard the thud of a fall
bird far behind but these i never retriev as sport our expedit
wa a failur moonlight and a clear sky were need both of which
were absent but in it wild in the sens of infinit wing
life rush past us in the last view of that desol countri as the
dark embrac it it wa a perfect and uniqu experi i am old
enough to be no longer veri anxiou for a bag therefor i enjoi
that even expedit with it on result widgeon more than
mani a dai pheasantshoot when the slain carefulli rais for

at length it grew pitch dark so that it wa difficult for us to find
each other in the gloom still more difficult wa our homeward
journei steer by the appropri light of venu which glow
befor us ly low upon the sky first came the causewai thi relic
of antiqu which show how care it inhabit now so long
dead onc were about their road in cypru is some eight feet wide
and built of larg block of stone on either side of it lie the
water of the swamp sever feet deep in place much of thi massiv
rais roadwai ha been destroi by flood or other accid of
time so that here and there on must leap from block to block or
subsid into the pool between now steppingston by starlight
would make a good titl for a novel but ar in fact an awkward path
and veri glad wa i when with the assist of a cypriot who seem
to be abl to see in the dark i had negoti the last of them
after these steppingston we advanc over a mile or two of greasi
mud about six inch deep then came some plough patch of ground
with ditch in them and anoth long stretch of mud thi time
cover with water struggl to it edg we found ourselv on a
path strewn with boulder and fell down in deep but invis rut
next follow a stroll through a larg patch of stand barlei which
wa reek wet and reach almost to our middl where we were
expos to the attent of the skilo or homeless dog which in
cypru ar such a nuisanc at last howev about nine oclock we
saw the welcom light of home i confess that i wa glad to reach it
shelter thoroughli tire out as i wa and absolut wring wet
with perspir a fruit of the labour of that intermin walk
littl expedit of thi sort teach us that we ar not so young as
onc we were still i enjoi our abort duckhunt
my nephew fire by the sight or rather the sound of more wildfowl
than he had ever dreamt of announc hi intent of be back at
the place by the first streak of dawn to catch the bird as thei
pass from the marsh out to sea i congratul him upon hi
superb energi but declin to share the adventur forese in the
depth of my experi as in a magic crystal exactli what would
happen it did happen about an hour after we had finish breakfast
on the follow morn two hot and weari young men appear
carri gun and cartridg but noth els thei had risen a
littl too late the duck were up befor them and thei reach the
distant ridg just in time to see the last flock of gees vanish
seaward
the rain had depart for the present and the dai wa love with so
clear an air that everi littl peak and pinnacl of the mountain
seem close at hand it wa with great regret that on so fair a
morn we bade farewel to our host and start for famagusta i
should have like to stai longer at acherit the place ha mani
charm not the least of which is it solitud
the tower where accord to ancient tradit desdemona wa actual
stifl by othello is an odd place for picnic yet thither on our
arriv we were escort through the ancient gate of famagusta
inde the feast wa spread exactli where the poor victim live and
di that is if ever she exist beyond the echo of romanc
in the venetian dai famagusta which is said to be built upon the
site of the ancient arsino wa a great commerci port now it
harbour is choke and princip becaus of the heat within the
wall such popul as remain to the place live about a mile
awai in a new town call varoshia how am i to describ thi
beauti mediaev monument an attempt to set out it detail would
fill chapter so i must leav them to the fanci of the reader the
whole place is a ruin everywher ar the gaunt skeleton of church
the foundat wall of longfallen hous and around grim solid

then round them all hewn in place through the solid rock the mighti
ditch sixti feet or more in depth it wa an impregn stronghold
thi famagusta and in the end it fell to the power of the greatest of
all gener hunger and not through the batter of mustafa the
moslem known as the destroy and hi vast armi
the turk came and conquer how i will describ present and from
that hour the glori of famagusta depart to begin with no christian
wa allow to live within the gate even the visitor of distinct
must not ride or drive there but walk humbl as becam a
repres of a conquer faith where the turk set hi foot
there the grass will not grow but here the sai is revers the
grass grow everywher amid the empti wall inde barlei is sown
where men dwelt in thousand and the christian church some of
them were turn into bath for the comfort of the mussulman while
the rest rot into ruin on of the three hundr and sixtyf of
these ruin fanesit is said that there were thi numberthat of
st peter and st paul a veri nobl and beauti build is now a
govern grainstor a desecr which i do not think ought to be
allow under the rule of england
the grand gothic cathedr wherein lie the bone of mani knight and
note men of the lusignan period whose wealth intellig and
labour rear it up is now a mosqu i am not learn enough to
describ it architectur in detail thi should be left to those who
understand such matter i can onli sai that it is love in the

in similar style all of them now wall up and abov them again two
ruin tower fix on to on of these that to the left of the
spectat as he face the build is a wretch and incongru
moslem minaret a verit pepperpot within the place is bare and
empti with here and there a carpet or a tawdri pulpit
is it right i ask now that the countri is again in the hand of a
christian power that thi ancient shrine dedic in the begin
to the god we worship should be left in the hand of the follow of
mahom i sai and the remark appli also to the cathedr at
nicosia that in my humbl judgment thi is wrong a matter of polici
that is the answer but ha polici no limit would it be so veri hard
and danger for thi great empir to sai to those turk who ar now
it subject thi is a christian place which your father snatch
with everi circumst of atroc and violenc from christian take
your shrine elsewher the land is wide and you ar at liberti to set
your altar where you will it is true that thei might answer doe
it lie in your mouth to protest when you turn other build equal
sacr in your ey into grainstor and clerk sit upon their
altar to take count
for gener the turk have us famagusta as a quarri export
most of the stone in it old build to egypt now it is commonli
said our govern propos to follow their evil exampl sinc the
present railwai and harbour scheme involv the destruct of the
beauti curtainwal abut on the sea and the us of the materi
it contain in the project work i have been assur by a compet
engin and other who can judg that such an act of vandal is
absolut unnecessari that thi monstrou thing will be done if it
is done princip for the sake of the shape stone that li to
hand will nobodi stop it if the coloni offic refus to
interven where ar the compani of antiquari and where is public
opinion where too is the societi for the preserv of ancient
monument
famagusta is on of the most perfect specimen of mediaev
fortif left in the world it can never be reproduc or reborn
sinc the time that bred it is dead now in our enlighten ag when
we know the valu of such relic ar the remain of the old citi to
be wantonli destroi befor our ey i trust that those in author
mai answer with an emphat no
in itself the scheme for clear out the ancient harbour and make
of famagusta a port connect by railwai with nicosia is good but the
haven thu reconstruct although old sir john mandevil more
regardless of the truth than usual even declar that it wa on of
the first harbour of the sea in the world can never be of great
import or compet to shelter liner and menofwar also i
imagin that it will be incap of defenc except by seapow now
at limasol it is differ there ow to the natur configur
of the shore a harbour where fleet might ride could be made with two
entranc far apart and have seven or eight mile of high land
between it and the ocean so that in practic noth could touch the
vessel that lai within the necessari dredg would of cours cost a
good deal although the bottom to be act upon is soft and kindli
perhap the total expenditur might mount up to a million and a half
or even two million the price of a few battleship battleship
ar supersed in a score of year the harbour with proper care
would remain for centuri we need such a place in thi part of the
mediterranean is not the question worth the seriou care of the
admiralti and the nation
in the same passag thi king of travellersand their
talestel us that in cypru thei hunt with papyon which ar
somewhat larger than lion the papyon ar not quit
imaginari sinc cheetah were us for sport purpos in
mediaev cypru when sir john goe on to add howev that the
inhabit of cypru in search of cool make trench in the
earth about in the hall deep to the knee and pave them and when
thei will eat thei go therein and sit there we wonder if he wa
well inform the preced passag also which unhappili cannot
be quot make us marvel even more

place as thei had fallen now thei have been collect into heap or
vanish in thi wai or in that otherwis all is the same except
that time ha thrust hi finger a littl deeper into the crevic of
the ruin build
what a tragedi wa the sieg of famagusta probabl few of my reader
and of the british public at larg not on in everi hundr thousand
have even heard of that event yet if it happen todai the whole
world would ring of it horror and it fame the boer war that at
present fill the newspap and the mouth of men ha to thi dai of
write cost us at the outsid six thousand dead at the sieg of
famagusta take no account of those in the citi if i rememb right
for i quot from memori more than forti thousand of the attack
forc alon perish beneath the wall
thi in brief wa the tale as it is told by fra angelo calepio of
cypru an eyewit and a doctor in theologi of the order of
preacher and other in the year 1570 accord to fra angelo the
sultan selim wa persuad by hi head mufti to undertak the
enterpris of the conquest of cypru from the venetian avaric
lust of fame differ of religion diabol suggest divin
permiss an unbound appetit for new territori to be ad to the
ottoman dominion these were the remot caus for the conspiraci
against cypru a nearer caus wa the wish of selim the emperor of
the turk to build a mosqu and school cypru wa to furnish the
revenu for thi piou enterpris fra angelo sai also that the
sultan wa influenc to the conquest of the island from hi fond
for it excel wine and the beauti falcon that ar taken
there
a great armi wa collect and allow ow to the mismanag of
affair by the venetian and local author to invest the inland
capit of nicosia after a gallant defenc by the untrain troop
and inhabit within thei took the town it is curiou to read
todai that grim badinag such as ha recent been practis by the
boer invest ladysmith wa indulg in by the turk at nicosia
thu thei drove a donkei up the wreck wall cry in mockeri dont
hurt the poor ass it can do you no harm and shout surrend
for you ar in a bad wai
the horror that occur when onc the turkish soldier were insid
nicosia ar too dread to dwell on here is a singl exampl sai
fra angelo among the slain were lodovico podochatoro and lucretia
calepia my mother whose head thei cut off on her servingmaid lap
thei tore infant in swaddlingcloth from their mother breast of
whom i could baptiz onli on and so forth on the dai follow the
sack the bestlook of the surviv lad and girl were sold by
auction the buyer take no thought or count of their nobl birth
but onli of the beauti of their face but these poor victim or
most of them were not destin to serv as slave in ani turkish
harem the great galleon of muhamit and two other vessel were laden
with them as a gift to the sultan to mehm pasha and murad the
sultan son but some nobl girl or woman her name is not record
though sure her glori should live on for ever think that the
death of herself and her companion wa prefer to so infam a
fate contriv to creep the magazin and fire it with the result
that the galleon and two other ship with everi live soul on board
of them were blown into the air the incid is in perfect keep
with the horrid histori of that period throughout europ
famagusta wa invest by mustafa and between on and two hundr
thousand soldier and adventur upon septemb 18 1570 the defenc
be under the charg of the immort mark antonio bragadino the
captain of the citi for nearli eleven month did the littl garrison
and townsfolk hold out with but scant aid from venic thei beat back
assault after assaultther were six or eight of them thei mine and
countermin thei made salli and erect new defenc as the old
were batter down in short thei did everyth that desper
could contriv or courag execut at length when onli five hundr
italian soldier and a few cyprian men and women were left sound
within their gate and mani of their wall and tower had been blown
into the air it wa want that conquer them not the turk
the posit of the citi wa now desper within the wall
everyth wa lack except hope the valour of the command
and the dare of the soldier the wine wa exhaust neither
fresh nor salt meat nor chees could be had except at
extravag price the hors ass and cat were consum
there wa noth to eat but bread and bean noth to drink but
vinegar and water and thi too soon fail
then after between 140000 and 170000 cannonbal mani of which i
have seen ly about to thi dai had been fire into the citi and
the turk had suffer a loss of from thirti to fifti thousand men at
length the brave bragadino negoti an honour surrend under
the term of which the defend were to be given their arm live
and good a safeconduct to candia under an escort of gallei and
the townsfolk the grace of stai in their hous to enjoi what wa
their own live like christian without ani molest therefor
upon these term peac wa sign and the soldier began to embark in
the vessel provid for them the next even or at ani rate upon
that of august the 5th the signor bragadino accompani by about a
dozen offic and attend by guard of fifti men accord to fra
angelo and nearli two hundr accord to bishop graziani paid a
visit to mustafa who receiv him courteous and kindli prais the
valour of the defenc the visit conclud thei rose to take leav
whereupon mustafa ask that the prison captur dure the sieg
might be sent to him bragadino repli that he had no prison then
the turk pretend to be astonish shout out thei were then
murder dure the truce and bade hi soldier who stood readi to
seiz and bind the christian
now it wa that the brutal ruffian mustafa show himself in hi
true colour the stori is best told in the word of mr cobham
translat of fra angelo calepio although bishop graziani account
as render by midglei is almost as good
thei were defenceless for thei were compel to lai asid
their arm befor enter the tent and thu bound were led on
by on into the open squar befor the tent and cut to piec in
mustafa presenc then twice and thrice he made signor
bragadino who show no sign of fear stretch out hi neck as
though he would strike off hi head but spare hi life and cut
off hi ear and nose and as he lai on the ground mustafa revil
him curs our lord and sai where is now thy christ that he
doth not help thee the gener made never an answer but with
lofti patienc wait the end count hercul martinengo on of
the hostag wa also bound but wa hidden by on of mustafa

soldier bound like so mani lamb were hew in piec with three

in thi inscript it will be observ that the besieg town is
spoken of as salami that be the name of the ancient ruin citi
which stood a few mile from famagusta
thu famagusta and with it all cypru fell into the power of the turk
who for three centuri rule it as ill as onli he can do now onc
more it ha pass into the hand of england long mai thi fair and
fruit island abid there to it own benefit and that of the
empir
on sad chang i notic on thi my second visit to famagusta
fourteen year ago the garden of varoshia as the present town is
call were full of the most love orangetre even at thi
distanc of time i can recal the pleasur with which i walk in on
of them smell the scent of the flower and consid the golden
fruit and green shini leav now thei ar all dead or nearli so
the blight of which i have spoken upon a previou page in the absenc
of remedi that their owner were too idl to appli ha slain them
here and there stick up old stem with blacken foliag and some
shrivel fruit sad memento of the past that would be better done
awai
often have i wish that i could paint but never more so i think
than at famagusta especi on morn when i stood upon the lone
seashor look out across the still more lone ocean stormcloud
were gather and in their blackest shadow old as the wall of
famagusta perhap stood a singl giant figtre it bud just
burst into point of crinkl greengold leaf there wa someth
veri strang about the aspect of that tree it look as though it
live and suffer it remind me fantast enough of the
tortur bragadino it natur bent wa sidewai and groundward but
the straight branch train thu by centuri of wind lai back
from the slope trunk like the outblown hair of a frighten feel
woman in colour it wa ashen the hue of death onli it root were
goldtint for the shift sand reveal them grip and
strangl each other like hate yellow snake it wa such a tree
as the saviour might have curs for barren and the site seem
appropri to it aspect about it were the sanddun behind it lai
a swamp with dead and feather grass shiver in the wind to the
right more sand in front the bitter sea and to the left show
state against a background of gloom the cathedr of famagusta
still royal in it ruin as i stood a raven flew overhead croak
and a great fox darker than our own in colour lope past me to vanish
among the dune
altogeth it wa a scene fit to the brush of an artist or so i
thought
within three mile or so of old famagusta lie the ruin that were
salami formerli the famou port of the messaoria plain where onc
st paul and barnaba preach the word of god in the synagogu of
the jew it wa a town eight hundr year befor christ wa born
howev for a monument of sargon the assyrian tell of a certain king
of salami and until the reign of constantin the great when an
earthquak destroi it it flourish more than ani other cyprian
citi now not even a hous is to be found upon it vast site and the
harbour that wa alwai full of ship is quit silt up mani of the
stone also that made it palac and templ have been built into
the wall and church of famagusta to find often enough an ultim
home in egypt whither the turk export them
on dai we visit thi place on our left as we went our host mr
perci christian point out to me a tumulu in cypru a rare and
notabl thing some year ago he open it inde the scar of that
oper is still visibl tunnel through the outer earth the
workmen came to a most beauti tomb built of huge monolith stone
fit togeth with an accuraci which mr christian describ as
marvel as it prove imposs to pierc these stone the
visitor were oblig to burrow lower and forc a passag through the
floor i could not i confess help laugh when mr christian ad
that to hi intens disgust he discov that other antiquarian in
some past ag had attack the sepulchr from the further side of the
mound thei also had been beaten by the gigant block thei also had
burrow and made their visit through the floor moreov by wai of
souvenir thei had taken with them whatev articl of valu the tomb
mai have chanc to contain
even sepulchresearch ha it sorrow i am afraid that if after
those dai and week of toil it had been my fortun full of gloriou
anticip to poke my head through that violat floor mere to
discov in the opposit corner anoth hole wherebi anoth head had
onc arisen i should have said how vex i wa and with some
emphasi he who labour among the tomb should be veri patient and
gentlenaturedlik mr christian
almost opposit to thi tumulu is a barrowshap build also
compos of huge block of stone set in an arch and enclos a space
beneath of the size of a small chapel out of which anoth littl
chamber open thi is call the tomb of st katherin why i do not
know from it gener characterist i should imagin that it is of
the mycenian period if the mycenian understood how to fashion an
arch the individu block ar truli huge and it is noth short of
marvel that men of the primit race were abl to handl them
it seem probabl that thi sepulchr and that in the oppos tumulu
date from the same ag perhap both the tomb were first built upon
the level of the design of cover them in beneath mound of earth
in thi event we mai conclud that the reput buryingplac of st
katherin wa never finish or occupi by ani distinguish corps
at least it is a curiou and most durabl monument of the past
all thi district is veri rich in tomb near by is the villag of
enkomi where mr perci christian dig on behalf of the british
museum recent found the mycenian gold ornament now to be seen in
it goldroom these enkomi tomb ar not structur remark and
lie quit near the surfac inde thei were first discov by the
accid of a ploughox put hi hoof into on of them at the
period of their construct howev evid it wa the habit of
the peopl who us them as their last restingplac to buri all hi
most valuabl possess with the deceas thu on of the grave
appear to have been that of a jewel for in it were found solid
lump of gold slice from cast bar of the metal as well as fashion
trinket
in mani instanc thei have been plunder in past dai although when
thi ha happen the conscienc of the ancient tombbreak more
sensit than that of us modern gener forbad them to take
everyth thu in on tomb which mr charl christian enter
though thi wa not at enkomi he found a portion of a splendid
beaker worth 60 or 70 in weight of gold which fragment veri
clearli had been wrench from the vessel and thrown back into the
grave it is a common thing in such case to find that all valuabl
have been remov except a singl ear or on bead of a necklac
left among the moulder bone to appeas the spirit of the dead
obvious these poor ghost were not suppos to possess more
intellig than the domest hen which after all the rest have been
remov will continu solemnli to sit upon a singl egg even if it
be of china
in on of the enkomi tomb mr perci christian discov the uniqu
ivori casket which is now in the british museum and valu there i

the necropoli of salami as mr perci christian inform me sadli
ha never yet been discov he show me howev where he
believ it to be under certain drift sandheap near the templ of

there it will rest till the british museum ransack it sinc privat
person mai dig no longer then what treasur will appear the

of the richest citi of the ancient world or such portion of it as
it owner took with them to their tombsnoth less
if onli all the multitud which onc inhabit these wall could rise
again befor our ey and in their compani those of the other dead
citi of cypru the great messaoria plain would be white with the
sea of their face and aliv with the flash of their ey there would
be no standingroom in cypru the million of them would overflow it
shore and crowd the brow of ocean further than the sight could
follow what ha becom of them where can there be room for
themeven for their ghost i suppos that we shall find out on dai
but meanwhil the problem ha a certain uncanni fascin perhap
the stock is realli strictli limit and we ar their ghost that
would account for the great interest i found in salami which most
peopl especi ladi think a veri dull place duller even than
famagusta
perhap the most interest relic of all those at salami is that
ruin of the fane of cypri which is set upon a hill there is
howev not much to be seen except broken column of the purest white
marbl and here and there the fragment of statu but the shape of
the templ can still be trace it situat overlook the sea
upon a rise mount where grow asphodel anemon and other skyblu
flower of whose name i am ignor is beauti and the sigh of a
million lover who worship venu at thi altar still seem to linger
in the soft and fragrant air
when we reach home again a ladi our fellowguest describ to me
the ceremoni of a turkish wed to which she had been invit that
afternoon i will not set down it detail secondhand but the bride
she said wa a poor littl child of eleven who had to be lift up
that the compani might see her in her nuptial robe and ornament the
husband a grown man is report to be an idiot it seem strang
that such iniqu upon which i forbear to comment further can
still happen under the shadow of the british flag
thi remind me of anoth turkish ceremoni on the dai that we left
famagusta at the conclus of our visit for nicosia we halt a
while to breath our hors in the villag of kouklia where by the
wai there is a beauti leak aqueduct that is cover with
maidenhair fern while i wa admir the fern and the water that
drip among them a turkish funer advanc out of the villag
which at a respect distanc we took the liberti of follow to the
burialground the corps accompani by a motlei crowd of mourner
rel sightseer and children wa laid uncoffin upon a rough
bier that look like a larg mortarboard and hidden from sight
beneath a shroud ornament with red and green scarv upon arriv
at the graveyard an unkempt place with stone innoc of the
mason hammer mark the head and foot of each grave and serv as
stand for pumpkin to dry on in the sun the dead man wa carri to
a primit bench or tabl made of two slab set upright in the ground
about seven feet apart and a third laid on them crosswai here
while a woman sit on a littl mound at a distanc set up a most
wild and melancholi wail for the depart a priest i know not hi
proper appel step forward began to offer up prayer to
which the audienc made an occasion respons the brief servic
conclud onc more the bodi wa lift and born round the cemeteri
to it grave that seem to be about three feet six inch in depth
here it wa rob of it gaycolour scarv of which a littl
child took charg and after a good deal of anim discuss
lower into the hole in a sit postur with the help of two linen
band that on of the compani unwound from about hi middl then
while a sheet wa held over the corps as i suppos to prevent it
face from be seen some of the mourner arrang plank and the top
of an old door in the grave abov it perhap to keep it from contact
with the earth at thi point we were oblig to leav as the carriag
wait and i am therefor unabl to sai if there wa ani further
ceremoni befor the soil wa final heap over the mortal remain of
thi depart and i trust estim turk
then we drove on across a grei expans reliev now and again with
patch of rich green barlei break into ear on our right the
rug tower point of the fivefing mountain call
pentadactylon stood out abov the black cloud of a furiou storm of
wind and rain which overtook us still we struggl forward through
it gloom till at length the sun shone forth and in the glow of
even we saw the wall palm and minaret of the ancient and
beauti citi of nicosia
chapter xiii
nicosia and kyrenia
nicosia look littl chang sinc first i saw it mani year ago the
tree that were plant in portion of the moat by the governor of
that dai sir henri bulwer have grown into consider timber
though by the wai those set upon the rocki soil round the wooden
govern hous have not flourish as i hope thei would also the
narrow street ar somewhat cleaner and more wholesom if ani eastern
town where all household slop ar thrown out into the gutter or
garden can be call wholesom that is about all no not quit all
for sundri hous have arisen outsid the new citi pretti dwell
with garden round them inhabit for the most part by offici and
the old konak or turkish govern offic after stand for some
six hundr year ha been in great part pull down and is now a
gape ruin thi seem to me a veri wanton and illjudg act for
the build had mani beauti which can never be seen again inde
on second thought the author appear to have share thi view
sinc when it wa press upon them by some local antiquari thei
desist from their destroi labour leav the uniqu gatewai
untouch though unless someth is soon done to support it not i
fear for long now it is a shelter place for wander at least i
found the blackest woman i ever saw in bed there who as i pass
made earnest represent to me in an unknown tongu to what
purpos i wa unabl to discov it seem odd to find so veri black
a person repos thu in the middl of the dai beneath that draughti
antiqu portal otherwis all is the same even mani of the govern
offic remain like myself grown somewhat older although death and
migrat to a better post have remov sever familiar face
i think it wa on the dai after our arriv that we start with our
host mr and mr hart bennett on a visit to kyrenia the beauti
littl seaport which li across the northern mountain our plan wa
to drive to the foot of these mountain and thenc to ride on
muleback to the wonder old castl of hilarion set high upon it
almost inaccess crag we never got there howev for the rain
stop us in my case thi did not so much matter for i had visit
the place befor but to my nephew it wa a great disappoint the
countri between nicosia and the mountain is veri curiou and
desol here the strata seem to have been tilt on edg by some
fear convuls in the begin of the world so that more than
anyth els thei resembl long line of militari trench of brown
earth ly behind each other in numberless success and top
each of them with a parapet of rock
on arriv at the policest near the foot of the mountain we
halt to lunch in the compani of friend who had ridden out from
kyrenia our meetingplac should have been hilarion but as i have
said the rain stai us to climb up into the bosom of that black
cloud seem too forbid and had we done so the castl is
shelter by no roof beneath which we could have picnick
nobodi seem to know who built hilarion or who live there mr
alexand drummond write in 1754 tell us that it is said to have
been fortifi by on of the lusignan queen charlotta who wa
oblig to shelter there when a usurp call jame the bastard as i
think her halfbroth had been establish on the throne by the
egyptian power cesnola write also that it wa a stronghold of the
lusignan and us by them as a state prison lastli i rememb that
when i wa there in past year a wellinform gentleman told me that
it had onc stood a sieg and been captur whereon three hundr
person men women and children were hurl from a particularli
hideou height into a chasm of the mountain i do not know if there
is ani foundat for thi legend at least the place which still
boast some love window and a huge cistern for the storag of soft
water is veri wonder set as it is so high among those giddi
peak with what infinit toil cost and pain must some old tyrant
have rear it tower their style by the wai is gothic
when the rain began to slacken i went for a walk to look at a wood of
young tree which some enterpris gentleman ha plant here thei
ar do well and among them i wa so fortun as to find the bee
orchi of our shore in flower also as i think i have said upon a
previou page to my delight i observ that all the steepflank
mountain round ar becom cloth again with forest of young fir
in the afternoon the weather now be fine we start for kyrenia
on the mule some of us take a rough ride across countri to visit
bella paisor de la paix as it is call by corneliu van bruyn who
wrote about 1693 and other authorsth old lusignan abbei which
stand in the villag of lapai to my mind the most beauti spot in
all cypru i am not howev certain that it wa an abbei drummond
1745 question thi sai that he suppos it to have been the
grand commanderi of the island own by on of the knightli
order he find corrobor of hi view in the name della pai
deriv he sai from the italian della paes though how thi prove
that the build wa a commanderi i am at a loss to understand i
confess howev to a certain curios as to the true design of
the ruin de la paix mean of the peac de la pai of the countri
bella pai beauti peac bella paes beauti countri whatev
mai have been the ancient form the last and modern read seem the
most appropri
the build is as i rememb it year ago onli somewhat more
dilapid certain crack ar wider certain bit of wall have
fallen it end draw more near thi inde must come within the next
few gener unless the govern will find monei to restor on
of it most beauti possess at present as i assur myself by
person inquiri it is not the will that is want but the mean
while the british treasuri grab at everi farth of surplu revenu
cypru ha no fund wherewith to preserv her ancient and mediaev
monument
the place cannot have chang much dure the last two centuri
inde van bruyn descript of it might almost pass todai on
thing that struck him i rememb struck me also talk of the
underground chamber or crypt he sai on might fanci it all built
five or six year ago even now over two hundr year later the
masonri is extraordinarili fresh also he speak of a certain veri
tall cypress i think that tree a monster of it kind is still
stand at least it stood fourteen year ago ow to the
circumst under which we left the abbei on thi visit i had no
time to seek out it graciou tower shape
it is difficult to describ such a build as bella pai for to give
a string of measur and architectur detail serv littleout
of a guidebook in the solemn old refectori a beauteou chamber
lead i think to the reader pulpit is a littl stair in the
seaward wall and at the head of thi stair a window and out of that
window a view if i were ask to state what is the most love
prospect of all the thousand i have studi in differ part of the
world i think i should answerthat from the littl window of the
refectori of the abbei of bella pai in cypru
around ar mountain below lie wood and oliv grove and bright
patch of green corn beyond is the blue silent sea and across it
far awai but clearli outlin the halfexplor peak and precipic
of karamania i said it wa difficult to describ an ancient build
but who can describ a view which so mani thing combin to perfect
that can scarc be defin in thought much less in word the
thousand colour of the eastern dai draw down to night the bend
of the cypress top against the sky the slow flash of the heav
ocean in the level rai of sunset the shadow on the mighti mountain
top the solemn of the grei oliv the dizzi fall of the
precipic the veri bird of prei that soar about ital these ar
part of that entranc whole but what worker in word can fit them
into their proper place and proport give to each it valu and
no more
in thi refectori thei show ring in the wall where turk stabl
their hors when thei took the island also mani hole at on end
caus the old nativ custodian swore with bullet fire in sport by
british soldier who were quarter here at the time of the
occup i like to think howev that the turk is respons for
these also and not mr atkin
i went to look at the old chapel not the build now us as a greek
church which we also visit thi chapel is quit in ruin and
weed grow rankli among the stone that doubtless hide the skeleton
of the priest and templar who onc bent the knee upon them the
cloister still remain with their charm pillar arcad and the
marbl sarcophagu of which all the old travel talk now the
quadrangl thei enclos is a grove of orang which have been plant
sinc my last visit in van bruyn dai it wa a garden and some
other voyag a centuri or so later talk of it as a barlei patch
perhap the templar us it as a court set out with flowerb and
fountain
by the time that we had finish our inspect the rain set in again
and night wa near for a while we wait under the shelter of the
cloister hope that it would stop but at length made up our mind
to a soak and start we were not disappoint it pour and
that is why in the gather gloom i wa unabl to look out for my old
friend the cypress tree moreov the road or rather the track wa
aw and my mule a proud and highstomach beast which had wax
fat on green barlei on of the laziest i ever rode my belief is that
he had been accustom to carri baggag not men and baggag mule
have their pace at least be innoc of spur i could not get him
along and to make matter wors at everi slipperi or awkward place
he stumbl out of sheer idl onc veri nearli fall in a
mudhol three feet deep what between the mule the rain and the
cold it wa i confess with joi that at last we dismount at the
door of our host mr tyzer the judg for the district of kyrenia
befor final bid farewel to bella pai there is on point which
i will mention in the hope that the matter mai be look into that
is if i am not mistaken in my surmis while ride through the
villag my companion and i observ the strang unhealthi
appear of the children inde i am sure that sever of these
poor hollowei littl creatur ar or were not long for thi
world now as the site is so high and wholesom i imagin that their
ill look must be account for in some other wai perhap the water
is contamin
the sight at kyrenia now vastli improv from what it us to be
ar the harbour and the old venetian fortress also in former dai
there wa a phoenician rockcut tomb with the skeleton of the occup
in situ and all it trim such as lamp and jar of
earthenwar but of thi i can find no trace todai everybodi except
myself seem to have forgotten all about him sic transit
gloriacadaveri there ar still howev plenti of these
phoenician tomb left in the neighbourhood
the castl is a fine build of the same type and period as the
famagusta fortif and those of nicosia accord to drummond
1750 probabl the whole work wa repair by savorniani who in the
year 1525 demolish the old work of these place and refortifi
them i do not know if he is correct and am i confess ignor of
the fame of savorniani although i think i have read somewher that he
wa a note militari engin of the period now the place is us as
a jail a fortun circumst sinc it make some care of the
ancient fabric necessari here i would suggest that at veri small
expens the old chapel could be restor thi is the more desir
as no church exist for the conveni of english resid
as at limasol the view from the flat roof of thi interest fortress
is veri fine command as it doe the rug height cap by the
grei tower of hilarion the fertil plain at their foot and the
oppos coast of asia minor immedi beneath li the littl
harbour upon which the govern out of it scanti resourc ha
spent sever thousand pound to my mind the monei might have been
better expend elsewher sinc thi haven is expos to the furi of
the northern gale and notwithstand it protect mole no vessel
of more than two hundr ton can enter it even in calm weather
the act commission mr onglei point out to me at the base of
on of the round tower against which the sea wash a littl window
that to within the last year or two ha been wall up access wa
gain to it by a ladder and the stone remov within he said wa
found a cell without visibl commun with ani other part of the
castl and in it the bone of a human be and those of a chicken
it is suggest that these remain belong to some polit
prison sent here perhap from venic to be wall up with the
chicken of cours under the circumst he would eat the chicken
after which the rat at him i must add howev that major
chamberlayn the commission at nicosia who is perhap the best
author in the island upon the mediaev histori of cypru and who
actual open thi dungeon throw doubt upon the stori myself i
do not quit believ it for a reason which he did not mention but
that appear to me to have weight i am convinc that upon such an
occas the starv captiv would not have left those bone he
would have crunch them up and swallow them perhap some corps of
which it wa necessari to be rid in a time of sieg wa entomb here
who can sai at least that cell possess consider specul
interest
thi fortress ha known the shock of war although i do not think it
offer ani notabl resist to the turk after the fall of nicosia
and famagusta here in 1465 charlotta wa besieg for a whole year
by her brother jame the bastard when she seem to have surrend
the place and fled with her husband loui to savoi
the coast of karamania which ar so clearli visibl from kyrenia and
lie at a distanc of about thirti mile ar not often visit by
travel whose throat the inhabit ar apt to cut thei ar
report to be a paradis for sportsmen as ibex and other larg game
live upon the mountain rang for a sum of three shill i
purchas an enorm pair of the horn of on of these wild goat
which had found their wai across the strait ibex i am told have a
habit when alarm of hurl themselv off precipic and land
unharm upon their horn in the cours of some excurs of the sort
the owner of my pair ha snap off the point of on of them natur
howev heal the fractur but the symmetri of the horn is spoil
i did not enjoi thi visit to kyrenia so much as i expect sinc as
is common in cypru my wet and chill on the previou dai induc
a touch of fever it wa mild howev and yield to a time
applic of quinin
so back across the mountain to nicosia anda bookteaa form of
festiv which ha just reach the ancient home of cypri myself i
confess i could have spare it sinc of all varieti of
intellectu exercis thi is the hardest that i know
nicosia is a place of mani amus thu thei plai golf there on a
cours of nine hole it is odd to do the round with a gentleman in a
round fez act as your caddi and to observ upon the greensor
the yellow for thei ar made of sandturkish ladi veil in
yashmak engag in the us task of brush and weed what
in their secret heart do those denizen of the harem think of us i
wonder would not their verdict if we could get at it be mad mad
my master but english folk would celebr booktea and plai golf
or ani other accustom game upon the brink of styx perhap that is
why thei remain a rule race for to do thi it is necessari to
preserv the habit and tradit of the fatherland refus
persist to allow them to be overwhelm by those of ani
surround peopl wit the triumphant surviv of the hebrew but
that subject is larg
the scene on thi golfcours wa quaint and picturesqu in front
appear the bold outlin of the kyrenia hill with rug old
pentadactylon five finger point to a flame stormi sky and
behind rose the palm and minaret of easternlook nicosia between
the two lai the wide plain across whose space from time to time
wend string of solemn camel the head of each ti to the tail of
it brother in front or littl group of ass laden with firewood
and other good a cypriot seat on the last of them in a postur to
be acquir onli by centuri of inherit experi the link
themselv ar by no mean bad though somewhat limit and
extemporari thu the bunker ar form of artifici bank vari by
an occasion stone wall the other hazard consist chiefli of
break of asphodel and rock crop through the apolog for turf
upon on of these rock ala i broke my host best cleek
i had long been look forward to plai a second visit to the
museum at nicosia which consist in past year of a few disorderli
room crowd with miscellan antiqu have befor i left
england read review of an import new catalogu of the cypru
museum i conclud that all thi wa chang the deeper prove my
disappoint
to begin with there is no custodian so i wa depend on the kind
offic of major chamberlayn to show me round after long hammer
we were let into the hous by a girl who said she would go upstair
and open the shutter of the room on the ground floor beneath the
archwai and in a kind of court altar remain of marbl hors and
chariot tombston bust unpack crate of antiqu some of
them mark as have been forward year ago were mix in great
confus the more preciou object were in a littl chamber open
out of thi archwai but it wa no easi task to discov the kei
which fit the case from which the trai had to be taken on by on
and then replac the cypru share of the famou enkomi treasur of
which i have spoken we could not find anywher it appear inde that
these object ar still lock up in some govern safe throughout
the whole collect the stori is the same so far as the gener
public and cypru ar concern it is practic valueless for thi
sad state of affair howev the govern must not be blame thei
have not a singl farth to spend upon such thing as relic of the
island past histori howev import and interest these mai be
in thi cypru collect to my astonish i came face to face with
an old friend mani year ago when first i visit famagusta i
feloni did steal a certain cannonbal which lai about among the
ruin just where three centuri ago it had fallen from some turkish
gun the ladi of our parti follow my evil exampl and stole
anoth both of these memento we bore back to govern hous and
there with the effronteri of harden offend openli displai
them now it appear that not long befor a special govern edict
had been issu against the remov of ancient cannonbal and it
wa point out that hi excel could not suffer hi own guest to
do those veri thing which he had forbidden to the public bow to

the island of cypru is on of the few countri in the world that i

the sea beyond onli i should like to be a rich hermitto the poor

emissari of the beyrout branch of the hous of cook arriv on board
and ask us if we had ani revolv or cigarett we had both
give them to me he said and ill see you through
then it transpir that in thi matter of revolv there is littl
differ between the turkish and the cyprian govern in a
countri where everi peasant goe about hi busi with a
doublebarrel gun slung across hi shoulder the respect

we left the ship with our belong and row to the landingquai
then the fun began such shout such gesticul such struggl
first we were march through a room where sat an ag turk who stare
at us sleepili to him we protest that we had noth noth with
such vigour that the least experienc might have guess that we
prevar then a minor cook and hi myrmidon hustl us through
passag and gatewai into the open street and whisper
mysteri there is someth wrong left us and vanish
in due cours it transpir the someth wa that our sleepyei
turk who wa by no mean so simpl as he appear had caught sight
of the larg revolv project from between the fold of a coat
gracefulli arrang to hide it by the artific of cook further he
had impound that revolv but as cook with admir promptitud
and disregard of fact inform him that we were sail for egypt in
a dai or two he wa so good as to promis that we could have it when
we left after thi thank to escap so cheapli we start for our

that afternoon i hire a carriag to drive out to a spot about ten

down hi throat made a nois like to that of a hound which bai at

while the hole into which the wheel drop continu were deep

so soon howev as beyrout wa left behind these same road suddenli
becam excellentno civilis turnpik could be better the chang
puzzl me greatli but afterward i discov the reason we had

after the fear massacr of the christian at damascu and elsewher
by the druse encourag thereto by the turk came the french

affili to the roman church inde although thei retain certain
special privileg sinc their priest have the right to read mass in

henc the good road the honest administr and the suggest
fact that properti which li within the territori of the lebanon
govern fetch if sold about five time as much as that of
similar extent and charact which ha the advantag of border on

mulberrytre which ar kept sever cut back as the young shoot

these mulberri ar not grown for their fruit but onli for the

sourc of wealth in thi district between these plantat lie
patch of vine and other crop
here the road wa crowd with transport anim donkei stagger
along under the weight of two great plank camel laden with mighti
sack of grain and so forth as we went i observ a farmer engag

when the agriculturist below had pile the spade with earth at a word

seem to me somewhat wast to emploi the muscl of three men to

for five or six mile our road ran on by the edg of the sea till at

of the german coloni who dwell theretheir veri boxlik prim
delight the ey full fed with syrian squalorthan for anyth els
have stop to pai a short call upon the consul where i saw my
friend the cavass look quit civilian and domest in hi morn
cloth we canter through the narrow street on to the road to
nazareth
thi road is on of the few that exist in the holi land like the new
pier at haifa which cost sever thousand pound and is quit
unservic it wa construct for the especi us of the german
emperor on the occas of hi recent visit to palestin in fact hi
majesti never us it as he abandon the idea of a pilgrimag to
nazareth and the sea of galile prefer to toil along the coast to
jaffa and thenc take the train to jerusalem when first complet
perhap it wa a good road of a sort but after two winter rain it
iswhat mai be imagin still carriag ar drag through it rut
and quagmir
on our right as we rode out of haifa rose mount carmel where the
prophet were hid by fifti in a cave and on our left ran a piec of
the railwai to damascu which somebodi began and never finish
travel on we cross the wide plain and the brook kishon where
the prophet of baal were brought down to be slaughter i suppos
that it water might take their accurs blood and bodi out to sea
thi plain is veri marshi and we found consider difficulti in
make our wai through on of the mudhol on the road inde the
baggag anim had to go round up the side of a mountain it wa here
that we met a number of mount soldier sullenlook illclad
fellow arm with rifl of a somewhat antiqu pattern thei were
hasten into haifa to attend the funer of the turkish governor
who had di suddenli dure the night
the slope of the carmel rang abov us were cloth with wild carob
which nobodi take the troubl to graft and turn to profit in the
deep kloof of these mountain also mani wild bear ar to be found
cross kishon we struggl against the wind that tore seaward along
it cours through a stretch of marsh star with yellow lili and
purpl orchi such as i find here in norfolk up that gorg whenc
sisera is said to have advanc with hi armi befor he met hi death
at the hand of the patriot but treacher jael at length ride
over parklik hill cover with beauti oak of a speci that i
do not know just then break into green and tender leaf we came to
a spot command a view of the highest part of carmel whither after
the great drought elijah sent hi servant seven time to look across
the ocean for sign of the come rain below it and about three mile
awai on a lesser hill mark by a tree is the veri spot where took
place the fear conflict between the prophet and the priest of
baal while beneath roll the wide plain of jezreel dull and endless
to the ey in the dens shadow of a raincloud
on the top of a ridg we stop to lunch among the ancient oak the
provis of thi or ani other meal caus us no anxieti we had
noth to do with the matter be so to speak taken in at so much
a head the find of food and inde of everyth except wine and
miner water is the dragoman affair under the contract and he
produc the same out of sundri bag which ar ti upon the variou
anim the liquor depart howev must be attend to by hi
princip i mention the fact in the interest of ani futur travel
who mai happen to read thi book for the matter is import water
in palestin is alwai doubt and frequent poison to drink it
mai mean typhoid fever or dysenteri therefor it is most need
that there should be a proper suppli of wine and apollinari or at
least of boil water the same thing appli in hotel in whatev
direct the tourist economis let it not be in what he drink
the spot where we picnick wa love amidst those primev oak and
the waterworn rock crop from the soil around us the ground wa
carpet in fact and not in name with the most beauteou anemon
red and pure white in colour that ever it wa my lot to see
diversifi on the more stoni spot with clump of flower cyclamen
from all about also rose the curiou chirp sound of grasshopp
while abov us in the blue depth between the threaten cloud
hover kite and falcon to our right lai the road where through
the tree string of camel were pass among them more soldier
hasten to the pasha funer and unveil women ride upon
ass or stagger along beneath titan load of firewood
present the restless david inform us that it wa time to start
the hors that had been ti to bush without food to prevent them
from roll with their load upon their back were bridl and off
we went along a fear track of mile of mud slough the german
emperor new road till at length we began to ascend the stoni hill
of galile stick flounder and thrash we reach their
crest and far below us saw the villag of nazareth a straggl
eastern township situat upon the lower slope of round rocki
hill which at thi season of the year ar liter sheet with
blue iri and with cyclamen
ye there lai nazareth the holi spot that like thousand of other
pilgrim in everi gener for year i had desir to see how is
it possibl for even the most cynic and faithless to look upon that
place save with a heart of deepest rever discard the war of
site and that wors war of the quarrel sect let the loud
speech of argu travel pass from your ear and rememb onli
that thi is nazareth the place where he live who ha influenc our
world most profoundli of ani of it son sure we should consid it
in thi spirit and in no other look there in a hollow of the hill
the ploughman drive hi oxen there the sower goe forth to sow
there a fig push it first leav show that summer is nigh
yonder in the waysid shop also the carpent pli hi trade and
at our feet bloom the paint lili of the field everi stone of
these mountain from which on mani a dai christ must have watch the
dawn begin to burn upon the plain of jezreel everi fertil fold of
those vallei were familiar to hi ey he love them we mai be
sure as even we common men love the natur object that present
themselv about the home where we were bred onli doubtless more
intens more pure with a deeper insight and a truer imagin
as a lad perhap like yonder child the saviour herd sheep and
goat among these start rock to while awai the time pluck the
cyclamen and iri and watch the flock of finch seek their food
among the thistl as a man he mai have work those ancient
ploughland take hi share of the simpl labour of the famili to
which he belong in short within thi circl that the sight
command for thirti year or more the almighti dwelt on earth
acquir in an humbl incarn on side of that wisdom which ha
chang the world here is the master fact that make thi perhap the
most holi ground in the entir univers and in it face what doe
it matter which wa the exact site of the annunci or of the shop
of joseph
nazareth li in a basin and it white hous run up the slope of
the surround hill the soil in the shelter vallei must be
fertil sinc here ar grove of fig and oliv hedg with great
fenc of prickli pear probabl omit certain modern build in
western style the appear of the littl town look at from a
distanc is not dissimilar to that which it present in the time of
our lord at least the countri must be absolut the same even down
to the veri rock which lie by the waysid the popul also both
in dress and person perhap mai not have vari much although some
writer think that it ha receiv a strong dash of white blood i
cannot sai upon what evid certainli howev i saw some children
that were quit fair in colour but as st antoninu write at
the begin of the seventh centuri mention the beauti of the women
of nazareth it is obviou that thi at ani rate is not due to an
admixtur of the stock of the crusad to thi dai that beauti is
remark for i observ it myself and it wa curiou to reflect
that among the peopl whom the travel meet in nazareth ar veri
possibl some of the descend of the brethren of the lord remov
from them onli by the steppingston of fifti or sixti short human
gener thi seem the more like as i cannot discov that the
inhabit of the township were ever slaughter out wholesal or
carri awai into captiv
mani site ar shown in nazareth among them two of the actual spot of
the annunci and a cave or cistern said to have been the virgin
kitchen then there is the workshop of joseph the stone tabl upon
which our lord is report to have eaten with hi discipl both
befor and after the resurrect whereof howev noth wa heard
befor the seventeenth centuri and the synagogu where he taught a
small build no longer in the hand of the jew of the authent
of ani of these relic or local noth is to be said except
that obvious thei cannot all be right noth except thisthat
here wa the home of mari and here the saviour live for thirti
year what more can be need
on spot there is howev that he must often have visit as a child
and man for there is no other water in nazarethth spring call
mari well thi gush out beneath an arch which although ancient
enough ha i suppos been built or rebuilt sever time sinc
the dai of our lord here in the morn and the even come the
women of nazareth with their children to fetch the household suppli of
water in narrowneck earthenwar pitcher or chatti which thei
bear upon their head some i am sorri to sai ar begin to
replac these ancient and grace vessel with squareshap paraffin
tin evid thi spring is the favourit gossipingground of the
commun for while the children plai about outsid or upon the roof
of the arch their mother and sister wash their feet in the overflow
water and chatter awai to each other of the new or scandal of the
hour so it would alwai have been hither dai by dai mari must have
come bear the empti pitcher balanc sidewai upon her head and
lead the infant jesu by the hand here too in manhood when
weari with toil in the summer heat christ mai often have sat at even
and perhap have taught those who linger round the fountain
thi well li on the outskirt of nazareth so that a few minut
walk from it take the visitor into the countri the flower that i
notic here were anemon ranunculi just show for bloom a
varieti of wild orchi with which i am unacquaint cyclamen blue
iri in sheet asphodel and about a mile out of nazareth a
singl patch of english daisi the bird in addit to the usual
crow and falcon were the newcom swallow the common sparrow that
here seem to build in cranni of the wall and the beauti
goldfinch of which i saw flock number as mani as thirti or
fifti i have never seen the goldfinch pack like thi in england
perhap becaus it is compar rare
on arriv we found our inn crowd with a portion of the countless
american compani who had absorb all the hors in palestin and were
now on the wai back to haifa where their vessel lai their conductor
who as i suppos to make himself more easili visibl to the item of
hi vast troop wa clad in flow eastern robe a kindli and veri
agreeabl member of the american nation told us a move tale which
suggest that such a post is no sinecur he took hi flock or some
of it to inspect i think that ancient roll of the samaritan law
which is kept in the synagogu at nablu here when the kohen wa
not look on of them tore a corner off the manuscript the theft
wa detect and complaint made thereupon my friend the conductor
summon the parti and address them upon the iniqu of such an act
in term so move that the conscienc of the spoiler wa work upon
with such effect that he restor the miss fragment
when howev continu the conductor on the veri next dai i saw
that same fellow sit upon the capit of a fallen marbl column
and smash the carv off it with a hammer well sir i assur
you that i never felt more like knock a man down in my life and
sir he wa a minist
let us hope by the wai that it wa the copi of the ancient
pentateuch which is frequent shown to travel as the origin
that wa mutil by thi piou person apropo of the abov stori an
american ladi told me at jerusalem that she met the same parti in
egypt and at on time saw a whole collect of themi think she said
eight or tenseat upon the head of the sphinx and engag everi
on in try to knock fragment from it with stone she ad that
she had never felt asham of her countrymen befor
thi remind me of a still more heinou storyi do not vouch for
itwhich in cypru i wa told of a certain travel the travel
a man of practic mind visit a famou shrine where a holi lamp had
been kept burn for five and as some said for seven hundr
year an ancient monk show him the lamp ye nobl pilgrim he
said i have watch it for sixti year and the good father who wa
befor me he tend it for seventyon so that the everlast flame
ha had but two guardian in a hundr and thirti year
and befor that ask the travel
befor that nobl pilgrim ah we do not know all we know for the
book show it is that the everlast flame ha not been out for five
hundr year it is said inde for eight hundr but that is
tradit here is a copi of the bookwould hi excel like to
see itand the monk turn to reach down the volum
never been out puff well ad the travel reflect
ani wai i guess that it is out now
when thi gentlemani mean not the practic travel but the
manag of the american caravanwhos name i regret to sai i cannot
rememb heard of our plight about hors kindli he promis to send
two of the best he had to meet us sever dai later on the top of
mount tabor the anim he said were engag to return to
jerusalem and might as well carri us there as not so we part but
ala as shall be told in it place though through no fault of hi
we never saw those hors
as no other steed were obtain we start for tiberia on our own
my nephew chang hi brown nag howev which on three or four
occas had nearli fallen with him for a wretch but surefoot
littl rat of a baggag poni that if not walk could onli travel at
a jerki trot the mulet who own him declar that the brown hors
wa perfectli right onli a littl stiff and have strap the
luggag on to it back proceed to show hi faith by mount on the
top at the first mudhol i heard a scuffl behind me and look
round to my secret joi saw the poor brute on it nose and hi owner
in the mire after thi he dismount and drove it through all bad
place
pass up and over the long hill beyond nazareth we saw saffuriyeh
below us which is the sepphori of josephu onc the capit of
galile and after the destruct of jerusalem the seat of the
great sanhedrim leav thi villag on our left we rode across more
steep hill to the vallei of kafr kenna which is believ to be the
cana of that marriag feast where the water wa turn to wine
beneath us lai the mudbuilt hamlet look much as it must have done
when our lord walk down to it with hi mother to be present at the
wed and on the road thither the spring from which the water would
have been drawn that wa made wine here as at nazareth we found a
number of women and children engag in carri water from the well
to the villag
ride on between hedg of prickli pear we came to a greek church
the tradit site of the miracl although that is disput by the
latin built into the wall of thi church which when we enter
it wa be us for the purpos of a school were two stone
measur capabl i should sai at a guess of hold five or six
gallon apiec these ar shown as some of the actual vessel that
held the water which christ turn into wine whether thei ar the
same is more than doubt but at least thei appear to be of the
pattern and period and have been exhibit for mani gener
leav kenna we rode by execr road toward what is alleg to
be the hill of the beatitud where the sermon on the mount wa
deliv although of cours there is a rival and to my mind
more probabl site in the neighbourhood of the ruin of capernaum
thi mountain which is name karn hattin is a lone hill stand
in a great plain remark for the extraordinari beauti and varieti
of it wild flower in place especi under oliv on old
cultiv ground the earth wa on pink flush produc by thousand
of a small manyhead bloom with which i am not acquaint
elsewher it wa quit blue with a gorgeou giant vetch or lupin
that grow among spring corn while everywher appear iri and
anemon mani in thi place of a magenta hue mix among the common
white and scarlet probabl on account of it size thi lupin is
i find not includ in the delight and interest littl book
wild flower from palestin gather and press by the rev harvei
green bd
it wa strang to look at that desol and unten mountain and
reflect that here upon it slopesfor the question between thi and
the rival site a few mile awai at capernaum is pure a matter of
opinionmai have sat those multitud to whom were spoken the word
which will echo through the world for ever concentr as thei do
the whole bodi of the christian law i believ it is admit that
thi immort and transcend sermon wa preach in the springtim
and whether or no it sentenc were utter among these rock
certainli the flower bloom in such profus about the place seem
to bring home to the mind with new forc and vivid those sai
which begin consid the lili of the field how thei grow that
other sai also behold the fowl of the air thei sow not neither
do thei reap nor gather into barn might well have been inspir by
the sight of the flock of stork which at thi season visit the
plain about mount tabor and mai perhap have been wander to and
fro within sight of jesu as he preach the greatest geniu that ha
adorn the world would natur have point hi moral with
convinc simil taken from the life anim and inanim which
present itself about him and must therefor come home to the mind of
everi listen howev ignor or obtus inde in the case of
either side thi reflect appli equal
it wa upon thi floweri mead on juli 4 1187 that the great saladin
shatter the strength of the crusad the christian were fight
with the reput true cross itself set up to inspir them around
which wrote saladin the frank flew like moth round light sai
the mussulman writer it wa then that the son of paradis and
children of fire fought out their terribl quarrel the arrow sound
in the air like the noisi flight of bird the water of sword the
blood of arrow spout out from the bosom of the mle and cover
the earth like the water of rain
the christian were driven back upon the hill of hattin and there
victim to burn thirst and the sword of the saracen thei
perish by thousand i saw write the secretari of saladin the
hill the plain the vallei cover with their dead bodi i saw
their colour abandon and soil with blood and dust i saw their
head struck off their member dispers and their carcas pile up
like stone
next dai the templar knight and those of st john who still live
were brought befor the sultan and to each of the emir and doctor
of the law he gave hi royal permiss to butcher an unarm
christian
such is the stori of the fall of the cross and the triumph of the
crescent at thi battl of hattin sad enough read even to the
christian of todai
befor we reach the mountain we met trail across the plain for a
mile or over some two hundr of that band of american travel
with whom we had becom acquaint at nazareth thei were all mount
and as we approach certain of them greet us with faceti cri
of baksheesh stretch out their hand in imit of arab
beggar in those surround to my tast the joke seem out of
place
their gather wa motlei includ as i notic a good mani
minist of differ denomin it most strike featur
howev wa afford by the ladi of the parti nearli all of these
even those who were provid with women saddl rode
straddleleg after the fashion of men a sight which i do not
rememb to have seen befor except among peasant in the far north
the gener effect struck me as ineleg and even unseemli their
attir also wa in some instanc peculiar thu on young ladi wa
cloth in an ordinari skirt much ruck up and a pair of enorm
syrian topboot anoth although the dai wa warm and dry wore a
shini macintosh which also had ascend in obedi to natur law
on finelook girl howev sat her poni a spirit arab like a
centaur i never saw ani on with a closer or a better grip of a
hors and i imagin that wherev she came from she must have broken
mani a colt but perhap these critic ar born of the merest
prejudic in everi depart of life it is nowadai easi to grow
oldfashion
the american vanish and the reput mount of beatitud reced
till at length ride to the top of a ridg we saw far beneath us
the blue lake of galile sparkl in the sunlight and surround by
it immens circl of green hill
look said the dragoman david point to a white speck on the
north shore of the sea there is capernaum
thatcapernaum the great and flourish citi that wa exalt unto
heaven that white dota monasteri as thei sai inhabit but by a
singl priest and the otherschorazin and bethsaida the same a
desol not even a monasteri here noth but stone and some
bedouin tent which at thi distanc we could not discern
then we began the descent it remind me of that which onc i made to
on of the most strike and desol place in the world the gloomi
rift of thringvellir where a thousand year ago the aristocrat
republ of iceland held it stormi and bloodstain parliament
now after a long scrambl down steep slope of turf to cut corner
in the abomin road of a sudden the citi came into view tiberia
is a crowd town set upon the shore of the great lake surround
with a crumbl wall and command by a fort in the last stage of
decad the veri arch beneath which we enter now consist of a
singl span of totter stone inde it is marvel that these
have not long ago fallen upon the head of some unlucki passeng
we went to our hostelri a tidi place kept as usual by german and
offsaddl there after refresh ourselv with tea and orang of
which after our long hot ride we stood much in need we set out to
explor tiberia the abod accord to the nativ of the king of
all the flea
heaven what a filthi place wa that the king of all the stench
must dwell there also the bazaar ar narrow and foul beyond
concept along some of them i could onli pass with a handkerchief
held befor my face down the centr of these pestilenti street
flow gutter full of everi beastli refus there too sit and wander
the popul of tiberia as i had been inform that thi citi wa
for the most part occupi by jew i wa curiou to see them
think that upon their nativ soil we should find repres of
the race more or less as it wa when it defi the roman eagl i wa
destin to disappoint here were no hawkei sternfac men
such as i had pictur here even wa no hebrew as we know him
strenuou eager healthi and cosmopolitan
far differ ar these jew for the most part of russian or polish
origin who dwell in tiberia at a littl distanc in their
dressinggownlik robe it is not easi to sai whether individu ar
men or women inde even when studi face to face their aspect is
singularli sexless their complexion ar curious pallid and
unwholesom while the hair of the men often of a burn red is
arrang in two thin curl which hang down oilili on either side of
the forehead in front of the ear like spare ringlet from the
chevelur of our greataunt i ask david who had dwelt among
them for year what thi curiouslook folk did for a live he
repli
oh thei just sit about
so far as i could learn thi seem to describ the fact but i
understand that the mean to sit about on ar for the most part
subscrib by charit hebrew in europ and elsewher mani of the
men ar howev engag in a studi of the talmud an occup for
which tiberia is tradition famou
when i add that whatev the season thei wear tall black hat and
skin cape that some of the femal children look pretti though not
strong and that the adult or individu among them ar not avers
to drive a trade in doubt antiqu it is all that i have to
sai of the jew of tiberia and their noisom habit
first david led us to a greek monasteri in the yard of which stand
a vault build us as a rubbish place said to be part of that
palac occupi by the sanhedrim after it wa driven from sepphori
thenc pass down more dread alleyswhat would happen if thei
got the plagu in themw emerg to the south of the town and
walk along the road which run to the hot bath here as the ruin
that lie on everi hand bear wit wa the site of roman tiberia
built by herod just befor the mission of our lord the saviour seem
howev never to have enter it perhap becaus it wa a pure
foreign citi on the cavepierc hill abov set there no doubt to
catch the cool even breez is said to have stood the palac of
herod while jut into the lake ar the wreck of ancient wall and
tower the road itself run through some templ for in it centr
worn to the level of the pathwai stand the base of a marbl column
and all about ar other such remain have inspect them but
stop short of the hot spring we return to tiberia on thi
occas we kept outsid the wall to avoid the smell and were
follow to our lodg by jew who wish to bui the photograph
camera and to sell us glass dug from the roman tomb
i omit to state that in on of the bazaar i saw a man hawk
sparrow he offer them for sale by two each brace ti to a
string i work out the price ask as well as i wa abl and
compar it with the valu of monei in our lord time found that it
wa about equival to the roman farth that wa paid for two or
the two farth for five a bird be thrown in doubtless to the
custom who took the full number truli such thing chang but
littl in the east truli also the sight of them make much clear to
the mind which befor it ha fail to grasp that is why a visit to
the holi land is in itself an educ to peopl who undertak it in
the right spirit and do not suffer themselv to be overwhelm by
discomfort and other annoy without see the countri itself

chapter xvi
the sea of galile
at night the sea of galile is veri beauti the crescent moon
sink to the horizon the myriad star reflect from the breast of
the water the soft distant line of the oppos hillswher of old
dwelt the gergezenesth hush of the heavi air the brood calm
broken onli by bark pariah dog all these compos a pictur and
leav impress that the mind cannot easili forget
tiberia is a hot town so hot that as the german hotelkeep told
me it is imposs for mani month of the year to sleep except upon
the roof even now in the spring the thermomet must have stood at
nearli eighti degre in the shade and the sun wa so power that i
wa glad to wear a bathtowel as a puggare also on the first night
that we pass there we were favour with anoth evid of the
genial natur of the climat my bed wa protect with gauz
curtain which i thought were drawn with care but about two in the
morn i awok to find myself the centr of a hive of mosquito the
next hour we emploi in somewhat ineffect hunt and in doctor
the lump with nativ brandi if as scienc ha demonstr of late
the bit of a common swamp mosquito convei malari fever what
diseas ought to follow that of those member of the famili which have
been nurtur on the filthheap of tiberia i confess that have
recent read a good deal about the subject the problem quit alarm
me leav these possibl asid howev i never rememb
meet mosquito more venom or that left larger lump with a
keener itch then those of tiberia except perhap some with which
i made acquaint on the river of chiapa in central america
when we rose on the follow morn i wa dismai to find that
although the wind wa not realli strong the sea upon the lake wa so
consider that it seem doubt whether we should be abl to sail
to the mouth of the jordan thi is a voyag which the tiberia
boatmen absolut refus to make in bad or squalli weather know
that now as in the time of our lord it is easi to be drown on the
lake of galile where a veri violent and danger sea get up with
extraordinari swift howev at last our men made up their mind
to try it and off we start to that greek monasteri which we had
visit on the previou afternoon where the boat await us
i wa not quit prepar for what follow arriv at the
landingplac we saw our boat pitch and roll furious about
twenti yard from the beach while between us and it breaker larg
enough to constitut a respect sea upon the norfolk coast rush
shoreward in quick success
might i ask how i began but befor i got ani further two
stalwart arab their garment tuck beneath their armpit amid a
choru of frantic yell and objurg from everi on concern
seiz me and hoist me most insecur on to their shoulder
plung into the foam the moment wa illchosen for just then
arriv a seri of bigger wave than ani that had gone befor we
were brought to a standstil we shook we bow we rock to and
fro while now my leg and now other portion of my frame dip
gentli in the deep i wa certain that all wa lost and that
present in compani with these infern boatmen i should be
wallow at the bottom of the sea of galile spoil my watch and
my temper suddenli thei made a last despair rush howev the
wave surg round their veri neck and reach the boat into which
i scrambl and roll i know not how afterward profit by my
experi which taught them how to sit and what to sit on also by
the fact that thei were lighter weight my nephew and david follow
me on board i regret to state without the duck their loudvoic
mockeri of my woe deserv howev befor anoth hour wa gone by
i had the laugh of both of them
when all were aboard we began our journei head for the mouth of
jordan which at a guess li eight or nine mile awai as there wa
no wind that would serv us furl the sail we depend on our
oar the sea wa veri rough quit as rough as i care for in thi
small boat although she wa staunch and good have been brought
here from beyrout for the especi comfort of the emperor of germani
who as it chanc never visit the place the continu toss
soon prove too much for david who collaps into the bottom of the
boat and lai therea veri dilapid dragoman my nephew who had
been an oar at colleg volunt to assist in the arduou and
continu labour of row but to the joi of the boatmen did not
get on quit so well as he expect in those unaccustom water the
voyag wa lonesom for on all that great expans of sea onc the
home of fleet i could see no other craft inde we were not sorri
when at length the weather began to moder and occasion gust of
favour wind enabl us to us our sail at time
still the experi wa interest for plough thu through the
stormi wave it seem easi to enter into the feel of the
apostleswho also were head for capernaumwhen about thi spot
thei were struck at the fall of night by the squall that nearli
swamp them what a sight must these water have wit in that
hour when suddenli as thei struggl forward do their best after
the fashion of the skill boatmen of the lake to keep head on to
those hiss sea thei perceiv the divin figur glide over
their crest toward them and again in that hour when upon anoth
occas the ship wa cover with the wave but he wa asleep and
hi discipl came to him and woke him sai lord save us we
perish and he saith unto them why ar ye fear o ye of littl
faith then he aros and rebuk the wind and the sea and there wa
a great calm but the men marvel sai what manner of man is
thi that even the wind and the sea obei him to read these
passag as it wa my good fortun to do while toss tempestu
upon the lake of galile the exact site of the occurr thei
describ and under circumst not dissimilar in kind although
differ in degre is to learn much so sluggish is our imagin
that to appreci such matter rightli and in full actual experi
of their like is necessari here that befel us
after some hour of row the sea went down in the sudden fashion
which is common upon galile and by the help of a favour draught
of wind we came at last to where the muddi water of jordan run with
turbul into the lake bring down much dbri and rais
larg backwardcurl wave for a littl while we sail up the
river studi the black camelhair tent of the bedouin encamp
upon it bank and the arab men women and children who loiter
round them then we put about and row through perfectli calm water
past the stoni desol site that now goe by the name of tel hm
where it is believ the ancient citi stood at ani rate here wa an
ancient citi though whether thi wa capernaum or bethsaida is a
matter of disput my own theori which i suggest with all humil
is that both bethsaida by it side and chorazin abov mai in practic
have been suburb of the main town of capernaum at least it is
certain that in the old dai all thi countri now an utter wast wa
veri dens popul and it must have been difficult to know
exactli where on citi end and the next began
pass the spot call heptapegon or seven spring which mani
author believ to be the place of the miracul feed of the
five thousand record by st mark we reach the monasteri of the
german cathol palestin societi and went to lunch in the hospic a
neat and cool build with a pleasant garden after we had finish
our meal we had the pleasur of be introduc to the reverend
father in charg who i think live here alon hi name is zephyrin
biever a finelook man advanc in life of courteou manner and
high intellig he complain bitterli of the treatment which he
had suffer at the hand of those tourist whom we met ride from
tiberia to nazareth sai that thei came in score took possess
of the hospic and at there without take the troubl to call upon
him or return him thank direct or indirect further he declar that
thei lai about on hi furnitur with their dirti boot soil it so
much that he had been oblig to send all the cover to be wash
inde the reverend gentleman wa truli anger in the matter and as
it seem to me not without some reason it is a piti that travel
should show such a lack of consider toward their host as it
make difficulti for those who follow them father biever state
that he would admit no more tourist of thi stamp but i hope that in
time hi chariti mai overcom hi wrath
our host most kindli took us to inspect some ground which after
great difficulti with the turkish author ha been purchas by
hi societi follow the line of an old aqueduct that in place is
cut through solid rock we came to the remain of bath and to a plain
below upon the border of the lake thi plain he believ to be the
true site of capernaum quot in support of hi theori the fact that
here met all the great caravan road to egypt to damascu and to
akka anoth point in hi favour is that thi wide expans of level
land must have been a veri suitabl site for a citi also here some
citi stood as the foundat wall and other ruin prove on
moreov whereon ha been fulfil the propheci of jesu that it
should be brought down to hell or hade accord to the revis
version which mai perhap have been a figur wai of sai that
it remain should be buri beneath the earth certain it is that
neither here nor on the rival site do ani of them remain abov it
surfac most expert howev seem to think that capernaum lai a
littl to the eastward nearer to the mouth of jordan the matter is
on of pure academ interest though natur our host would wish
to believ that the religi associ to which he belong
possess todai the verit spot of ground where our lord live and
taught nineteen hundr year ago
father biever show us also what is said to be the site of chorazin
now mark by a singl tree grow on a hill abov and the plain
where accord to the earliest tradit after hi resurrect
the saviour bade hi discipl to come and dine
here on thi waterlog swamp i found a tortois bask in the sun
after it winter sleep and secur it desir to attempt the
difficult experi of bring it home to england a task which i
achiev with mani adventur inde not five minut from thi
moment of write i saw that tortois which ha now becom quit
tame buri under the shelter of a carnat in my garden here in
norfolk poor capernaum for so is he name doe not entir approv
of our english climat and at the first touch of cold or rain goe to
ground in protest until the air is dry and the sun shine onc more
then he come up devour the young lettuc and make wild
endeavour to start in a beelin back to the sea of galile although
activ under suitabl climat condit in appear he is
distinctli antiqu i wonder how mani gener have gone by sinc
he began to crawl about the edg of the sea of tiberia even in thi
countri individu of the speci have been known to live for sever
centuri but no on ha yet discov what is the life period of a
healthi tortois in it nativ clime perhap thi on bask in the
sun and slept in the shade when herod the fox built tiberia in honour
of hi master the roman emperor it is at least conceiv
have bidden farewel to father biever and thank him for hi
kind we reach our boat on the back of arab and went
afish by the bank where onc the apostl shot their net
strip himself almost nake the fisherman wade into the sea and
cleverli cast hi net toward the boat then follow it line he
advanc till the water wa up to hi armpit draw in the net as
he came present in it mesh appear a great fish which he
extract and threw into the boat next he went back to the bank
walk along it a few pace and repeat the perform thi time
there were two fish of a differ speci to me the scene wa
intens interest sinc i suppos that in much the same fashion
and near thi veri place simon peter and andrew hi brother were
cast a net into the sea when their master who wa walk upon
the shore saw them and call them to be fisher of men
after we had made an end of fish we row toward tiberia past
the coast of magdala where mari magdalen wa born the even wa
now love and the sea calm as glass beauti also were the
reedfring bank among which hid waterfowl and still more
beauti a great green and gold halcyon that sat on the bend
bough of an oleand and at our approach fled awai like a flash of
colour light so by degre we made our homeward cours the boatmen
as thei row sing a quaint and melodi lovech upon the old
theme of an ag suitor who by success gift of everadvanc
valu tri to persuad a young beauti to be hi from time to time
for the sun wa still hot thei paus to refresh themselv with
copiou draught of the lake water drunk from out of an old meattin
thi water the inhabit of the district find healthi but in
stranger it induc dysenteri
on our wai to the hotel after land from thi interest
expedit on of the most interest inde that i ever made we
saw a curiou sight in front of the fort not far from the inn a mob
of hideou bedouin women with their children rough camel that
grumbl savag sheep goat and kid on of which wa be
carri advanc with a sullen air from the gate of the turkish
gaol it appear that a travellerwhat travel we never
ascertainedhad been rob by bedouin somewher in the
neighbourhood of mount tabor thereupon a parti of soldier surround
the whole tribe concern and march them into tiberia the men
have been lodg in gaoli wonder when thei will get out againth
women and their belong were be driven off into the wilder
to await the reappear of their lord and master justic as it is
administ in syria seem somewhat wholesal and indiscrimin but
of thi particular exampl the european pilgrim is not like to
complain
that even we dine with mr soutar an abl and experienc
missionari of the free church of scotland which support a hospit
and mission station in tiberia the matron of thi hospit wa our
fellowguest a refin and if she will pardon it proclam a
veri beauti scottish ladi the destini that appoint such a person
to tend and care for savag bedouin and tiberia jew seem strang
inde
mr soutar whose energi and good work ar known throughout these
coast told me mani amus stori of the difficulti which
confront a missionari in ottoman dominion thu he is a great reader
and ha a good librari but the custom author of palestin ar
prejud on the subject of book thei even seiz baedek guid
when thei see it and mai perhap treat the present work in the same
fashion inde mr soutar find it almost imposs to import the

on payment of a duti charg which wa assess by weight a brother
missionari at jerusalem for whom he import the encyclopaedia
brittanica wa not so fortun as that work wa held to be
revolutionari in tone and confisc ultim it wa rescu by a
third missionari a man of busi capac who paid baksheesh
in the form of a fix salari to a certain high offic when next an

encyclopaedia must be hand over to hi friend it arriv that
veri night
the turkish customhous ha a particular avers to map
consid them doubt and danger invent of the frank on
of the mission societi not long ago tri to import some chart of
judaea as it wa in the time of solomon thei were impound
thereupon a missionari attend and explain that thi map show the
countri as it had been when the king of israel rule the turk
listen and answer impass
your word cannot be true for in those dai thei drew no map and
therefor cannot have made these for the rest thi land is rule by
the sultan and to speak of ani other king who had dominion over it is
treason let the pictur write be destroi
it seem to be the same with everyth befor ani good work is
carri out a coloss ignor and prejudic must be conquer
thi can onli be done in on wai by the scientif distribut of
baksheesh thu even to build a hospit necessit a firman from
the sultan and all dweller in the east know the cost and infinit
labour involv in procur such a document nor must the offici
be what thei ar by blood tradit and upbring be too
sever blame sinc accord to mr soutar thei ar all
regularli discharg everi two year and by thi simpl method forc
to repurchas their place at a great price sometim also a decre
is issu that thei shall receiv no pai for four month and
sometim the post must support itself out of incident and irregular
profit that is by briberi and blackmail with a famili to feed
under such circumst most of us would becom corrupt
turn to anoth subject mr soutar inform me that the jew of
tiberia expect that their messiah a great and power king will
rise bodili out of the sea of galile i ask him also of hi work
and he inform me that jewish convert ar veri rare and much
oppress inde their exist is made almost unbear he
quot a case in which hi own father and rel had utterli
disown a man who becam a christian refus to know him when thei
met happili howev after some incid which i forget in thi

the matron also told me of her hospit which unfortun i wa
unabl to visit as we were leav tiberia so earli on the next
morn on of her chief difficulti lai in deal with the
bedouin a tribe which furnish mani patient these peopl until
some desper sick bring them to the charit christian door
have veri frequent never slept under a roof from year to year thei
wander accord to the immemori custom of their peopl rest
beneath the star in summer and crowd into the black camelhair

rememb similar experi when after camp on the african veld
for week i first return to civilis abod on of their

when at length he wa persuad to the attempt he ascend them upon
hi hand and knee scrambl along as we might do in cross some
terribl and precipit place these arab howev ar veri
thank for the skill and kind that is lavish on them inde
those who ar cure show their gratitud in mani touch and simpl
wai nor is thi sentiment lack in the rel to whom thei tell
their wondrou tale of the compass of the frank
at length much edifi and instruct we bade farewel to our kind
host with whom in their merci work be all good fortun and
return to the inn here we found the tortois as uncomfort as
ani wild bedouin in a hospit ward engag in waddl round and
round the room with an activ surpris in a creatur so ungainli
my subsequ mosquitohaunt dream of him and of hi farreach
past ar i regret to sai too fantast to be set down in a sober
chronicl of fact
on the follow morn we depart from tiberia for tabor the dai
wa dull and a coverlet of mist hid the broad surfac of the lake
while abov patch of cloud hung upon the mountain forebod wet
reach the higher level we rode over a plain where in place the
road that like everyth els had been prepar for the
disappoint german emperor wa actual plough up by industri
husbandmen who grudg the few feet of ground it cover further on
howev the turf becam so sound and good that we could actual
canter over it without fear of fall a rare circumst in
palestin
on our wai we met a process of a hundr or more russian christian
make a pilgrimag round the holi land these peopl collect from
the vast interior of the russian empir land at jaffa and for the
rest of that long journei trust to their leg thei walk with tall
stave mount in real or imit silver were clad in rough friez
and carri kettl and pack their onli baggag strung about their
bodi nearli all of them seem elderli greybeard men and women
who were past the ag of childbear although here and there i
notic a young woman perhap unmarri or a widow i believ that
these person who if thei be fanat certainli deserv the respect
of all rightthink peopl belong for the most part to the peasant
class and by mani year of selfdeni save up enough monei some 10
or 15 a head to enabl them to make the desir pilgrimag the
women ar veri plain and short in statur but somehow their lack of
favour is redeem by the kindli of their face their husband
and brother also ar home in appear but in thi respect seem
to improv with ag for both here and in other place i saw old men
among them who might be call handsom at least their white hair and
earnest ey gave them digniti thei appear to be fond of flower
at ani rate we notic that notwithstand their oppress burden
mani of them carri bunch of anemon in their hand moreov
thei had decor the hors of their mount guid with wreath and
coron as we went by thei greet us with courteou gestur and
in word which we could not understand i could not help contrast
the conduct of these simpl piou folk with that of the troop of
tourist whom we had met a few dai befor and compar their bow
and gentl salut with the hand outstretch in imit of
arab beggar and the jocos cri for baksheesh which to my fanci
perhap overnic amidst these hallow scene seem to strang
out of place
i have spoken befor of the flower of palestin but never in ani
other spot did i see their equal for loveli and frequenc it is
scarc too much to sai that here for whole mile it would have been
difficult to throw a shill at hazard without it fall on some
beauteou bloom everywher the turf wa carpet with them in a
pattern of gloriou colour such as no man could design or execut
over thi starri plain wander flock of hundr of stork david
drew hi revolv and fire a shot whereupon thei rose like thunder
make the air white with their wing to wheel round and round in
circl and settl again far awai where thei nest i know not if thei

even thei ar the fowl that i have seen build upon the rooftop
in holland who can tell i wonder by the wai why these bird

differ in climat between the netherland and the flat of eastern

mani ar the far memento of the past which i omit as i despair of

the great basilica first built by order of the empress helena with
it sister but inferior chapel on either side suppos to have been
dedic to mose and elia it is a long build with a round aps
which ha been disint in recent year at the eastern extrem
of thi aps stand an altar built up again of the rough origin
stone and surmount by a plain iron cross thi altar place upon
the extrem verg of the mountain is by immemori report believ to
mark the spot where our saviour stood dure the occurr of the
ineff event of the transfigur who can look at it unmov
ancient it wa roof in now in it simpl loneli it stand
open to the heaven and thu to my mind gain in digniti and

shrine with some tawdri dome i prefer the infinit arc of the ski

which grow amid the moulder stone onc the southern wall of thi
basilica were heap with saracen tower and fortif now it
and these have come to an equal ruin
at the fall of night through the midst of torrenti rain driven in
sheet by a violent gale of wind i went out and stood alon upon the
broken wall of on of these ancient tower till dark overtook me
and the gust becam so fierc that on that narrow peril place i
grew afraid to match my strength against their furi beneath me
stretch the vast plain of esdraelon look extraordinarili grand
and gloomi in the dull light of that rush storm there to the
right wa the territori of zebulun to the left the land of issachar
behind the countri of naphtali yonder soar the point of littl
hermon and beyond all rose the crest of mount gilboa suddenli
reveal in swift glimps to be as suddenli lost to sight it wa
inde a majest prospect but noth there move me so much as that
desol altar and the iron cross which stood in the dim aps beneath
it would be hard for ani man to set down the thought that strike him
in such a scene and hour i will not attempt the task further than to
sai that thi on lone experi repaid me for all the toil and
difficulti of my visit to syria
two falcon were nest or prepar to nest among the stone of
the tower my advent disturb them with wild scream thei swept
around me and the presenc of these creatur seem as it were to
complet even to accentu the solemn condit of the place as
the great eagl that alwai hover about the crest of tabor complet
and accentu it stori and etern solitud if ever there wa a
spot where god in hi power might manifest himself upon an earth he
love and wa pleas to redeem sure thi on is fit so at
least i thought who wa happi in the occas and circumst of my
visit seen in the glare of dai and crowd with hundr of russian
pilgrim perhap it would have impress me differ
that even also we went to the greek church and monasteri ly on
the north of the plateau some of the build here ar veri ancient
and includ gigant mediaev cistern baedek state that the
greek claim to possess the actual spot of the transfigur but in
thi i think he must be mistaken at ani rate when i question the
monk thei deni ani such pretens the spot of the
transfigur thei told me wa where it is shown in the ground of
the latin thei onli own the ancient church built as thei said in
honour of mose and elia
on return to the hospic we found that the pre barnab had arriv
and were introduc to him he is a missionari priest of the best and
most elev stamp on of those men to be found among the votari
of everi creed from whom good and chariti seem to flow befor he
wa sent to tabor he follow hi sacr profess for mani year in
china and elsewher and be gift with an intellect capabl of
draw profit from the mani experi of a vari life as i soon
discov he ha made the most of hi opportun for observ
we came to mount tabor prepar to rough it wherea the dinner serv
to us in the hospic wa i think about the best we at in palestin
it onli lack on thing the societi of our host but i imagin it to
be against the rule of the order that he should eat with hi guest
especi in lent after our meal the pre barnab join us
howev and we spent the next three hour discuss in french and
english tabor and all that ha to do therewith the mountain by the
wai is still ravag by hyena of which an enorm stuf specimen
is set upon the wall of the refectori inde on of the fierc
watchdog that ar kept in the yard is partli paralys by a bite in
the back from the iron jaw of thi raven beast
most of our convers howev turn upon the ident of the
mountain with the place of the transfigur of our lord to prove
which the pre barnab ha written hi book le mont thabor against
thi ident variou argument have been urg but the princip of
them allinde to my mind the onli on which seem to have much
weighti that advanc by baedek that the transfigur could
scarc have taken place on tabor as the top wa cover with
hous in the time of christ to thi father barnab answer and
prove what he sai that at the epoch of our lord there wa no town
on the crest of tabor thi inde seem to be selfevid see
that to the present dai the onli watersuppli is obtain from
cistern which do not appear to be of veri ancient construct
moreov there is evid on the point that of josephu war of
the jew book iv chap i speak of mount tabor he sai now
josephu erect thi so long a wall in forti dai time and
furnish it with other materi and with water from below for the
inhabit onli us rain water as therefor there wa a great
number of peopl gotten togeth on thi mountain vespasian sent
placidu with 600 horsemen thither afterward he tell how their
water fail them and so thei deliv up the mountain and
themselv to placidu note the mountain not the citi
here is what father barnab sai upon the point of baedek

let us turn for a moment to the evid in favour of tabor first
there is the apocryph gospel of the twelv apostl which is also
known as the gospel accord to the hebrew into the merit or
demerit of that strang work which seem to have been written
toward the end of the first centuri of our era thi is not the place
to enter the onli point with which we need concern ourselv is that
the writer or writer who probabl began to live within fifti year
of the date of the crucifixion connect tabor with the saviour in
chapter xvii v 1 jesu is made to sai now my mother the holi
spirit seiz me by a lock of my hair and carri me on to the
mountain of great tabor
origen state posit that tabor is the mountain in galile on
which christ wa transfigur st cyril of jerusalem who live in
the fourth centuri sai thei were wit of the transfigur
of jesu on the mount tabor st jerom sai of st paula she
scale the mount tabor whereon the lord wa transfigur
i might quot other author but perhap i have said enough on the
matter i will onli add therefor that after visit the place
hear father barnab learn discours and read hi abl and
excel book for my part i am convinc that he is right and not
baedek that here and nowher els happen the divin occurr
which is record in the gospel
when we rose the next morn it wa to find to our dismai that it had
been pour with rain all night and that more wet threaten under
ordinari circumst thi would have matter littl but with the
plain of esdraelon to cross the affair wa differ on these flat
in dry weather ride is easi enough but after prolong rain whole
stretch of them ar turn into slough of despond through the
worst of which a hors can scarc pass the lot of the travel who
find himself founder in these mudhol and benight on that
inhospit plain or forc to take refug in some filthi
verminhaunt nativ habit is not by ani mean agreeabl with
fresh strong hors much mai be ventur but the condit of our
poor anim ha alreadi been describ and we had been disappoint
of our remount the question wasdar we attempt to forc them
through sever dai journei over swamp and mountain when ask
father barnab shook hi head while david wa downright despond
of cours he said sadli for me it doe not matter i can take off
my cloth and wade in the mud but what i am wonder is how you
gentlemen will like that
as hi opinion wa evid veri strong against our make the
attempt upon such wretch hors in the end to our great
disappoint we were oblig to abandon the idea of attempt to
reach jerusalem by nablu thi decis involv return to haifa
and journei thenc to jaffa by sea and so on to jerusalem such
ar the vex accid of eastern travel but as our plan would not
allow of our wait sever dai upon the chanc of the weather
clear and as if we did it seem more than doubt whether we
could obtain fresh hors there wa no choic but to bow the head to
fate also there were compens thu the ruin of samaria
jacob well and the old roll of the samaritan law except there is
not veri much to be seen upon thi nablu rout wherea by return
we should have the opportun of visit acr and mount carmel and
make a second halt at nazareth incident also as it wa now no
longer necessari that we should leav the mount that morn we had
the advantag of a more prolong explor of tabor with father
barnab as ciceron
by the wai to be the priest in charg of on of these hospic dure
the spring when visitor arriv must be a somewhat arduou task the
escort of troop of russian pilgrimswatch the while that thei
do not carri the place off stone by stone as relicsi in itself a
labour for which after a time the contempl of their pieti can
scarc compens wors still to my mind must be the daili round
of conduct a certain class of tourist mani of them careless
indiffer or ignor and some not even care to avoid pain
their guid by scof audibl at event scene and tradit
which to him ar of the holiest
just as we return to the monasteri after three hour of industri
examin mr brocklebank an english clergyman arriv see
that the father wa thoroughli tire and that he had other thing in
hand i ventur to offer to take hi place and escort the newcom
to the best of my abil for thi i feel that i ow my apolog to
mr brocklebank sinc i must have been but a poor substitut for
father barnab howev i did my best though i fear that i led my
victim a desper danc whilst search in a chao of wall cave
and grave for the place where the ancient jew wash the bodi of
the dead which i wa determin that he should see at last i am
proud to sai i found it
after lunch our wretch steed were brought round and have
collect the tortois capernaum and restor him to hi basket i
bade farewel to father barnab with veri real regret and start down
the mountain though not by the road we had wish to travel
capernaum by the wai had i fear pass an unhappi night he is a
creatur which dislik cold and so soon as i let him loos to take
the air he made furiou attempt to buri himself in the rocki soil of
tabor when he paus exhaust from these ineffect labour on of
the monasteri dog seem to have discov him the interview that
follow must have been of a natur veri similar to that which as
histori relat occur beneath the sofa between the monkei and the
parrot it wa a dishevel and dilapid capernaum that went into
the basket among the baggag thank howev to hi thick shell hi
health did not suffer materi
on our ride over swell hill to nazareth we found yet other
flower gorgeou red tulip and a most splendid varieti of iri
though of thi either here or elsewher i saw no further specimen
in the even we went for a long walk about the nazareth mountain
dig up cyclamen root studi the charact of the agricultur
and try to identifi site that walk in the pleasant rainwash
air and amongst those surround is on of my most agreeabl
recollect of our journei final we revisit mari spring
and so back down the steep street of the town on our wai a littl
incid occur which reveal the differ between the manner of
east and west on of the pretti nazareth children a girl of about
thirteen follow me for a long wai with her persist and worri
cry of baksheesh hadji that is pilgrim at length i turn and
put into her outstretch hand a particularli beauti anemon which
i wa carri how the joke would have been receiv by an english
beggar mai be imagin but thi girl took the flower curtsei and
went awai smile
next morn earli we start back to haifa on our wai we met a
shepherd cloth in a robe of mani colour doubtless such as jacob
gave to joseph and bear upon hi shoulder a lost sheep thi
illustr of the sai of st luke wa realli remark what
man of you have an hundr sheep if he lose on of them doth not
leav the nineti and nine in the wilder and go after that which
is lost until he find it and when he hath found it he layeth it on
hi shoulder rejoic
it show onc more how close the saviour clung to the us of natur
exampl around him as a groundwork of hi parabl and how littl
those exampl have chang in the cours of nineteen centuri
on reach the outskirt of haifa we struck to the left pass some
of the neat hous of the german settlement in a field attach to
on of these i saw to my delight a colonist us a good european
plough and congratul him upon hi enterpris thenc we rode to
the flank of carmel which we began to climb about halfanhour
ride brought us to the monasteri at the top here monk have live
sinc the twelfth centuri when the hermit becam the carmelit but
twice thei have been burnt out and massacr and onc their church
wa made a mosqu onc also it wa a hospit when in 1799 the
great napoleon laid sieg to acr ultim he retreat whereupon
the turk came and butcher hi wound men in thi monasteri on
mount carmel thei ar buri outsid it gate
the view of sea and land from thi place is veri fine within the
church we were shown the cave where elijah hid himself it mai be so
but there ar mani like it all about the mountain leav the
monasteri we began to descend the further side of carmel by a trail so
steep that we were oblig to scrambl along it drive our hors
befor us inde the wai in which these activ creatur manag to
keep their foot upon slant and slipperi slab of rock wa
noth short of marvel howev thei came down without accid
all the slope of carmel ar cover with the most beauti flower
and sweet herb nurtur by the dew for which it is famou here
amongst other plant and shrub the odor thyme grow in mass
also white wild rose and variou ground orchid
not far from the bottom of the mountain and face the sea we reach
the cave where when jezebel cut off the prophet of the lord
obadiah took a hundr of them and hid them by fifti i confess that
what ha alwai puzzl me about thi passag and not less now that i
have seen the place of hi righteou act iswhat becam of the other
fifti i suppos that as space wa limit thei had to hide outsid
and take their chanc of be cut off by jezebel
thi cave which is acknowledg by the nativ jew who occasion
hold some religi servic here ha all the appear of be
genuin with pack it would accommod fifti prophet and there
is a suppli of water in a cistern cut out of the solid rock
the next dai wa sundai and we went to the english church although
i am sorri to sai i forget by what mission or societi it is
maintain it is an exceedingli neat build and furnish in the
most excel tast the servic wa attend by a good number of
nativ christian some of whom wore the fez thi custom i cannot
quit understand i notic that our dragoman david who is a
christian frequent kept on hi fez in place of worship although
sometim he took it off for instanc in the church of the holi
sepulchr i ask him to explain the matter but could get no
satisfactori answer he said it wa a question of custom and shrug
hi shoulder orient as we know show respect by cover the
head and bare the feet so i presum that even when thei adopt
anoth faith thei ar still apt to obei an immemori tradit the
subject is on worthi of investig by the learn why for
instanc should the apostl paul speak so strongli on thi point in
the eleventh chapter of corinthian he sai everi man prai or
prophesi have hi head cover dishonoureth hi head but everi
woman who prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncov dishonoureth
her head for that is even all on as if she were shaven for a
man inde ought not to cover hi head forasmuch as he is the imag
and glori of god but the woman is the glori of the man
i admit that i do not understand these sai or what root
convict caus the great apostl to deliv himself with such forc
upon the subject it is difficult to comprehend why a woman dishonour
her head by appear in a place of worship without a cover which
after all is onli design as a protect against the weather or
wa the true origin of the habit in the east in the case of woman
meant to be a protect against the unauthoris and inappropri
admir of men in other word wa the headpiec allud to a veil
or yashmak
the whole matter is mysteri for instanc why have turk so deep a
vener for the turban the travel will often have notic at
the head of ottoman grave a conicalshap pillar which i am
inform is intend to symbolis the turban i do not know if thi
is realli the case but i have seen in cypru tomb in ancient
build that must themselv be centuri old cover the remain
of moslem saint whose veri name ar forgotten whereof the head
pillar is still adorn with the actual turban of the depart what
seem the more curiou is that as the cloth of thi articl of dress
rot fresh wrap ar from gener to gener wound about
the decai core by the hand of the faith why is thi done
that sundai afternoon we made an expedit to acr to reach which
town we cross the kishon by a bridg not easi to negoti and
proceed for about two hour on a sandi road that run along the
seacoast near acr anoth river must be ford the ancient belu
now call nahr namn there is a bridg over thi river also but at
present like most thing in palestin it is broken down and onli a
few dai befor our visit some hors had been kill in attempt
it passag the result wa that in order to cross we were oblig to
wade out into the sea where the river join it through water which
reach to our hors belli march along the sand we met a band
of turkish conscript rag and melancholylook peasant who had
been press into militari servic these poor men who must serv for
five year receiv littl or no pai lucki ar thei if thei get food
and cloth christian ar not impress not from ani consider
of their faith or prejudic but becaus the turk perhap wise
do not trust them as the price of exempt thei pai an annual tax of
about 10 which look at from their point of view strike me as
an excel bargain among these conscript i note on or two men
who were quit old david explan i cannot sai if it is
correct wa that thei had escap conscript in past year but
have at length fallen into the hand of the recruit agent were
march off to do duti as cook or camp servant
acr that we enter through a great gate beyond which stand a fine
but dilapid hous now we were told occupi by soldier but
onc as i judg a palac is a mass of broken fortif mani
of them date from the crusad period everywher in acr ar
enorm meaningless wall passag and bastion in the sea itself
stand an old castl of the crusad on the sea front a stretch of
wall batter to ruin by shot and never rebuilt where onc wa a
great christian church now appear the yard of a caravanserai fill
on the dai of our visit with camel and group of persian merchant
round thi court formerli a place of worship still run nobl
cloister carri upon pillar of egyptian granit taken doubtless
by the templar or other knight from the ruin of some pagan
build for all the capit ar of the mediaev period and
fashion in a differ stone abov these cloister built over the
support arch stand room occupi by the merchant and other
travel
acr which ha a popul of about 10000 soul is the most
entir turkish town that i have visit the inhabit ar said to
be veri fanat even more so than at nablu inde dure ramazan
the annual mahommedan feast i wa told that it is not safe for
european to be seen walk about the street especi if thei
offend the prejudic of the piou son of the prophet by smoke
there seem to be a larg garrison of turkish soldier in the place
and wretchedlook enough thei were in their rag and patch
apolog for uniform some of these mount guard at the gaol we
look through the bar of the iron gate and saw the prison
within miser wretch crowd togeth in a courtyard i believ
that for food thei ar oblig in most case to reli upon what is
given them by the charit or their relat if none is brought to
them thei starv while from everi dish the gaoler take hi toll
when thei saw us thei thrust skinni arm through the bar of the gate
offer for sale whip which thei manufactur the same inde
that ar us on their own back onli more ornament it would be
interest to know what is the death rate per thousand in these den
and what happen when an epidem strike them the same that befel
at newgat a centuri ago perhap i left thi inferno with pleasur
acr then call accho wa origin a phoenician citi

gui de lusignan besieg it in 1189 and in 1191 coeurdelion join
him and storm the citi exactli a hundr year later it wa
recaptur by the sultan melikelashraf such is the histori of acr
or so much of it as need concern us put in the fewest possibl word
what sight those ancient stone have seen on mai sympathis with
the object of the crusad i do myself and even i confess should
suffer no sorrow if ani of the christian power were move to take the
moslem by hi turban and propel him out of the small district so
sacr to all that section of mankind who believ that here live and

or the greek were in a posit of complet author thing would
go veri hardli with other section of the christian famili perhap
inde thei would fare better at the hand of the jew
to return to the crusad hi method wa not equal to hi motiv or
mayhap a disposit not origin strain of the qualiti of merci

leader were traitor the moslem swarm in thousand and inch by
inch through street that were a shambl the town wa taken there
wa a nunneri in it where dwelt the virgin of st clare st
antonin and the chronicl wadin in hi annal minorum tell the
stori of their end i am sorri that i cannot quot wadin account in
full as some modern tast might find it outspoken here howev is
a summari
when the abbess who must have been a brave woman knew that the enemi
had enter the citi she caus the bell of the convent to be rung
the sister have assembl she told them what thei must expect in
veri straightforward languag
my dear daughter my excel sister said she we must in thi
certain danger of life and modesti show ourselv abov our
sex in thi crisi we cannot hope to escap their furi by
flight but we can by a resolut pain it is true but sure she
then went on to point out that the sight of mutil face is
revolt to human and to suggest such mutil probabl it wa
not fear but conscienc which prevent her from advis a more
thorough though under the circumst easier and perfectli
legitim alternativethat of suicid the abbess end i will set
you the exampl let those who desir to meet their heavenli spous
imit their mistress at these word she cut off her nose with a
razor the other did the same and boldli disfigur themselv to
present themselv the more beauti befor jesu christ
the end of the stori is simpl for the saracen on behold their
bleed face kill them all without spare on thu these
forgotten heroic women achiev their martyrdom what a spectacl must
thei have present as thu disfigur their white robe stain with
their own blood thei sat each in her accustom place within the
chapel tell their bead and mumbl prayer with mutil lip
while the devilish saracen burst in upon them
and it happen thi is no fiction of the romanc a few brief
gener sinc thu did those nobl women suffer die and pass to
their own place
the true blood and the fals show themselv on that dai of fear
sai the french historian michaud john de gresli and ost de
granson fled awai at the veri commenc of the battl mani
other who had taken the oath to die at the aspect of thi gener
destruct onli thought of save their live and threw awai their

but there were some of a differ stamp thu the old patriarch of
jerusalem wa drag to the port by hi friend resist separ

sinc he insist upon receiv so mani fugit into hi boat that
it sank and all were drown then across the dark oblivi year the
face of william de clement shine like a star when the templar had
abandon the gate of st anthoni he return to it and thrice
charg the saracen alon aliv he regain the centr of the citi
but let the old chronicl of the time tell the rest
quand il fut revenu au milieu de la cit son dextrier fut molt

sarrasin coup de flche ruerent terr frre guillaum

the phrase in the mediaev french le dextrier resista en contr le

the end of the scene wa terribl i quot from michaud the sea wa

there is more and wors to follow almost too dread for quotat

i suppos that on pound went as far as three todai if not a good

possess at least 300 to spend upon thi enterpris alonethat is
suppos the gold piec refer to have been approxim of the

imagin fondli pictur the piou felix and that fish try to
stare each other out of counten perhap troi had someth to
do with the jaffa legend that here andromeda wa bound and rescu
from the dragon of thi stori sir john mandevil 1322 ha made a
most marvel hash
and you shall understand that it joppa is on of the oldest
town of the world for it wa found befor noah flood and
there mai still be seen in the rock there the place where the iron
chain were fasten wherewith andromeda a great giant sic
wa bound and put in prison befor noah flood a rib of whose
side which is forti feet long is still shown
thi is a downright libel on andromeda that fair maid whom we see in
everi academi often three time over attend by a pleas varieti
of dragon still if some artist would paint her or him accord
to mandevil the chang would be refresh
felix a man of learn ha the legend much more correctli but even
he talk of the virgin giantess andromeda evid also there
wa someth in mandevil stori of the bone sinc felix sai
the bone of that sea monster which perseu slew were of vast
size and us to be publicli on the beach over against the citi
and were shown to all who visit joppa but afterward thei were
remov from thenc to rome by titu and vespasian and hung up in
a public place for a marvel for inde thei were worthi of
admir for everi on of it rib were fortyon feet in
length but saint silvest and the other saint who consecr
rome to christ broke up those bone and all other marvel lest
pilgrim should come hither to see them and likewis lest
pilgrim who had come to rome for the sake of honour god and
hi apostl should lose their time and wast hour which might be
spent in prayer in view such strang sight some declar that
these were the bone of the virgin giantess andromeda which seem
imposs becaus perseu took andromeda awai with him into
persia and end hi dai there and we nowher read of hi
come back to joppa
it will be observ that felix doe not question the authent of
the bone becaus their dimens ar somewhat unusu but becaus
perseu took hi wife to live with him elsewher and did not bring her
back the vision of a ladi who measur eightytwo feet not inch
round the waist doe not seem to have struck hi imagin as a
thing particularli out of the common nor did he consid it from the
point of view of her husband perseu or inde of the poor dragon
who wa expect to eat her
josephu also mention the matter but in a veri differ style hi
wa not an ag of fabl he sai
here is the impress of andromeda chain which is suppos to
have been cut in the rock with a view to give credibl to the
ancient fabl
in truth these old chronicl whether for fact or fiction ar veri
fascin to read in their page we ar transport to a realm
strang real yet fanci there like the figment of some dream
peopl and ruler long depart pass in shadowi process befor our
ey the thing thei strove for their ambit their rare virtu
their bloodi crime ar matter to muse on in an idl hourno more
thei have gone utterli all their tumult and battl ar dust for
the most part unfruit as that of their own bone their veri name
ar forgotten not on in a million is known and of these how mani
ar rememb even by student yet the sea of jaffa which affright
them still hiss by the vessel side the narrow via dolorosa upon
the holi hill of zion that thei trodsom of them with sigh and
tear or some of them up to their hors knee in bloodstil

thei knelt still flower and fruit upon the mount the stage is the

here the seri grow long stretch from the dai of mose down but
how mani more of them ar there to come those strang
forthshadow of gener yet unborn not to be born perhap
for thousand upon thousand of year so deep in time that to them we
mai seem further off than mose is to us well such specul lead
nowher so let us return to our own particular pilgrimag experienc
in our own individu hour
the embark at haifa wa disagre and the night on board wa
crowd circumst that ad to our joi when we found the morn
fine and were therefor reliev of the terror of be carri on
prematur to port said thi wa the second time in my life that i
have pass through the grin jaw of the jaffa reef onc a good
mani year ago when i chanc to be off thi port i land and spent
a dai there just to be abl to think that i had trodden the soil of
the holi land i rememb on thi occas wit a furiou
quarrel between a customhous guard in a boat and a washerwoman
bring off clean linen to a ship in anoth boat the guard want
to seiz the linen or probabl to extort baksheesh but the ladi
defend her good with a shrill and volubl tongu call thi
repres of the ottoman law unsavouri name and reflect upon
hi parent for sever gener back inde as her boat bob
up and down over the swell she shook her fist beneath the watchman
martial nose till at length thoroughli outtalk he drew hi pistol
on her and thu i left them now oddli enough no on seem abl to
tell me the end of the stori
land at jaffa is a tumultu affair even in the best of weather
but we accomplish it without so much as a wet and were march
to the hotel where we had six or eight hour to wait until the train
start for jerusalem
jaffa the joppa of the bibl ha much the same histori as other
coast town in palestin it wa taken by pharaoh thotm iii and wa
the port of the holi citi whither in the dai of hiram came the cedar
from lebanon and we will cut wood out of lebanon as much as thou
shalt need and we will bring it thee in float by sea to joppa and
thou shalt carri it up to jerusalem and again in ezra thei gave
monei also unto the mason and to the carpent and meat and drink
and oil unto them of zion and to them of tyre to bring cedar tree
from lebanon to the sea of joppa accord to the grant that thei had
of cyru king of persia
the jew the greek and the roman were it master all in turn

i believ that there is hardli anoth such abomin harbour to be
found in the whole circuit of the sea seem to have been almost a
total ruin at ani rate the onli lodg for the pilgrim wa a
darksom and decai dwell beneath a ruinou vault known as st
peter cellar wherein the saracen thrust him even as men ar wont
to thrust a sheep into a stabl to be milk as the place wa full
of the most abomin filth we learn with satisfact that in thi
cavern there is a seven year indulg which the pilgrim obtain
if he enter therein with a devout spirit
there is veri littl to see in jaffa although the travel is shown
the roof upon which st peter slept when the vision of thing clean
and unclean came to him as he tarri mani dai in joppa with on
simon a tanner thi site as baedek point out ha been chang
of late year formerli it wa at the latin monasteri now it is over
a littl mosqu it seem probabl that there is noth to prove the
authent of either spot how can there be in a town which ha been
destroi so mani time what is authent and unchang howev
is the heap of dirt outsid the door of the sacr build after
mani year i knew the sight of it again also it noisom scent
float into my nostril like some sweet rememb odour of earliest
childhood there it li that miniatur but ancestr midden and
there doubtless it will lie from gener to gener until the
turk depart from the coast of syria
thenc we drove to the greek church where the visitor is shown what
is said to be the tomb of tabitha and the place where peter gave her
hi hand and lift her up and present her aliv so that
it wa known throughout all joppa and mani believ in the lord
the tomb seem to be some ancient catacomb but whether or no the
bone of tabitha repos in it who can tell
when last i wa here as i have note wa the case at famagusta in
cypru the orang grove were beauti to behold now nineti tree

where a peculiarli dread tragedi is said to have occur that of

if all the train that leav chare cross in the cours of a busi dai

the nois and confus would equal that which occur at the station

and demand more baksheesh what life what excit what turmoil
what argument what deadli feud what vocifer on the part of
the offici but we get off somehow in a veri crowd carriag and
the variou dragomen clad in their best attir for the entri into
jerusalem explain as their command of english or french give them
grace the wonder through which we ar pass
here is the fertil plain of sharon look rather desol beneath
it cloak of windi wet there is the place where the ark wa set up in
the templ of dagon to the dire discomfitur of the philistin who
suffer so sore from it presenc and found it so difficult to be
rid of yonder accord to all tradit samson ti torch to
the tail of a vast number of foxesi think it wa three hundr
thi feat leav the modern wonder how he manag to snare so mani
all at onc for in ani time or countri to catch a fox is not easi
there too in that villag he wa born and there he di
old testament histori studi from the window of a railwai carriag
becom it must be confess a littl confus but without doubt
thi wa the territori of the philistin and the fact bring home to
the mind how veri small is the area wherein were enact the great
event record in the bibl soon the plain ar left behind and we
begin to climb the mountain that lie about jerusalem like a wall
barren hill succe barren hill perhap onc thei were cloth with
vineyard now onli flower cyclamen grow in the cranni of the
rock
at length about six oclock the train pull up and onc more fierc
confus begin to reign we have reach jerusalem the mountain
wind blow bitterli the rain fall in torrent and everywher on
step in liquid mud sometim it is two sometim four sometim
six inch deep the experienc choos the twoinch strata the
flurri wallow in the sixinch depth the local cook appear drag
us into a carriag and off we flounder present what look like a
mediaev tower rise befor us we ar inform that it is the castl
of david now the turkish citadel which is believ to be at ani
rate so far as it foundat ar concern the phasal built by
herod on of the few place that titu did not destroi when he sack
the town and burn the templ we pass through the jaffa gate and the
wall built by the saracen that still give to jerusalem the
appear of a stronglyfortifi mediaev citi and so by street
which we cannot distinguish in the wet and gather gloom to our
hotel
next morn we awok to the sound of a roar gale and of rain
dash against the window such rain as accord to bishop arculf
who visit jerusalem about the year 700 exhibit god peculiar
attach to thi place by wash out the street after an annual
fair it wa cold also bitterli cold almost might the travel have
fanci himself onc more in florenc i clad myself veri warmli
top up with a covert coat and a macintosh but when david saw me
as we prepar to start upon our expedit he said it would not do
at all that i did not understand the climat of jerusalem and must
put on my ulster also i obei and befor i return thank him for
hi advic
in place the narrow lane of jerusalem were run inch deep with
water beneath the lash of the torrent which as arculf remark
provid them with their onli wash inde thei ar filthi almost
as filthi as those of tiberia if such a thing be possibl
especi in quarter inhabit by the jew where none should
linger we pass through the crowd bazaar now reek in a damp
cold mist that seem to embalm the smell accompani by a cavass
from the consul and a soldier whose protect is suppos to be
necessari to the visitor to the harmeshsherif the nobl sanctuari
where onc stood the templ and palac of solomon and herod it is
approach or at least we approach it by a kind of coveredin
allei of a filthi so peculiar and surpass that befor it
everyth els of the kind which i have seen in the holi land sink
it ineffectu stench imagin a peopl who ar content that so foul
an avenu should lead to their great sanctuari
we went up step and were within the sacr area it is a great place
cover mani acresi never heard their numberbut much of it is
overgrown with grass amongst which were bloom blue flower like
those of borag just now also it wa sodden with rainveri grei
and desol to the ey beneath the low scud cloud
it wa with curiou feel that at length i set my foot upon thi
hilltop the womb as it were of the world fate where have been
enact so mani of the most aw scene of histori spiritu and
human here the ark stood here great solomon built hi fane without
sound of saw or hammer that fane which wa to be destroi and
rearis again to be destroi and again aris here at last dawn
the light of that predestin dai when the roman eagl were born
across it and the hallow templ of jehovah went up in sheet of
fire to heaven here the veil wa rent and the sanctuari desecr
while the blood of it votari ran ankledeep into the vault below
men have worship here by million thei have perish here by ten
and twenti of thousand the voic of christ ha echo here the
shout of the victor the scream of the conquer the moan of the
dy the solemn sound of sacrific the blare of ceremoni
trumpet the daili whisper of a peopl rever prayerit ha
heard them all in turn here stood solomon in hi glori and all the
congreg of israel befor the ark of the lord in which wa
noth save the two tablet of stone which mose put there at
horeb here the cloud fill the hous of the lord and solomon
said i have sure built thee a hous to dwell in a settl place
for thee to abid in for ever here he prai that thine ey mai be
open toward thi hous night and dai here too came the answer
when jehovah appear to the king a second time that hi petit
should be fulfil while the men of israel and their children remain
faith but if not then will i cut off israel out of the land
which i have given them and thi hous which i have hallow for my

ar thei not astonish and do not the nation of the earth speak

chapter xix
the nobl sanctuari the pool of solomon and bethlehem
the mosqu of the rock known as the nobl sanctuari where onc stood
the templ of the jew is a beauti build even to those who
like myself do not particularli admir the orient style of
architectur also it is alreadi ancient at it door a mahommedan
priest receiv us and rough wrap of sackcloth were bound about
our feet which as thei were wet through and cold to me were
comfort then we enter the place where we found ourselv quit
alon it is spaciou with a great dome it window ar full of
love and ancient stain glass it wall set with harmoni
eastern tile it floor cover with rich carpet underneath the
dome fifti feet or more in length surround by an old iron screen
and on of wood stand the sacr rock where abraham is said to have
made readi isaac for slaughter where too as seem to be gener
admit stood the jewish altar of sacrific for mani gener
inde there is a hole pierc through it centr that receiv it is
thought the blood of the victim which wa carri awai by the
drain beneath
some fine natur instinct or perhap a priestli tradit caus
the hebrew to leav that rock untouch except for the step cut on
it by the crusad it is much as natur made it in the begin and
doubtless so it will remain until the end million of year ago it
wa heav up in the first cataclysm of the univers thousand or
million of year henc it will crumbl and disappear in the last
gener catastroph the sacr associ that make it famou abov
everi other stone in the worldeven that of meccawil cling as it
were to but on hour of the immeasur aeon dure which it is
destin to endur through long long epoch it must have been but a
rock upon a mountain breast through other epoch yet to come again it
mai be but a rock upon a mountain breast but for two thousand year
or so it wa the altar of god that atom of hi wide creation from
which hi chosen peopl offer him prais and incens symbolis in
their burnt sacrific thi rug mass of stone impress me more
than all the vaunt glori of the nobl sanctuari also it is a true
relic the court the wall the column thei have vanish everi
on no trace of them is left abov the ground yet that rock of ag
still remain the onli thing as i suppos connect with their
worship which ha wit the histori of the jew almost from the
begin that still wit it and will in some far ag wit
it end whatev that end mai be
we saw mani thing in the mosqu for instanc there is the cavern
beneath the rock with place where david and solomon us to prai
and a round hole abov made we were solemnli assur by the head of
mahomet as he went up to heaven like a cannonbal thi hole
howev as i believ ha to do with the blood channel from the
altar of sacrific the mussulmen sai that at the last judgment the
almighti will take hi seat upon thi rock and that beneath the
cavern is the pit of spirit where on certain dai in everi week the
deceas assembl to their devot visitor to the nobl sanctuari
hear mani such stori most of them connect with the prophet all
of which must be listen to with becom graviti and rever for
my part i found the task try as without indors friend felix
vigor view i chanc to hold strong opinion upon the subject
of thi prophet whose doctrin will i believ caus even more
bloodsh and miseri in the world in the futur than thei have brought
upon it in the past it is howev a part of the experi
at thi time mahomet the devil incarn the firstborn of
asmodeu the son of belial the messeng of satan the deceiv
of the world the confus of mankind the destroy of the
church of god the fals prophet the forerunn of antichrist
yea antichrist himself the fulfil of heresi the corrupt
of the divin law the persecutor of the faith and the
miracl of all that is fals began to displai hi mad that
the lament propheci set forth in revel xiii about him
might be fulfil becaus he wa that horribl and detest
beast whom john saw rise out of the earth have two hornsand
so forthth book of the wander of brother felix fabri
among other thing we were shown a stone slab into which mahomet who
by the wai i believ wa never here in the flesh hammer nineteen
golden nail at the end of everi centuri or upon the occurr of
ani veri import event the devil remov on of these nail he ha
now got them all except three and a half for the angel gabriel just
caught him in time and caus him to break on in hi hurri when he
succe in abstract the rest the world will come to a sudden end
or thu sai the mahommedan what a chanc is here for that
practicallymind travel of whose deal with an ancient lamp i
have alreadi told the tale pictur the face of the faith when
next morn thei found those last nail gone and the end of all
thing come up like a torpedoboat under a full head of steam onli
he might find these warlik moslem more difficult to deal with than
prove the poor old priest
our holi guid intim to me that by place monei upon thi
nailston i should assur my etern safeti accordingli i purchas
salvat to the valu of ninep in small chang which he
pocket then we went on and saw more wonder
leav the mosqu of the dome we visit the dome of the chain a
beauti littl build which is call david judgmentseat and
also the dome of the ascens a memori of anoth of the miracl
of mahomet then we were shown the entranc to variou cistern
especi a vast reservoir which must have exist in the time of our
lord that is known as the sea thi us to be suppli with water
from solomon pool that lie at a distanc of sever mile from
jerusalem next we came to the mosqu elaksa known too as the
mosqu of omar becaus that caliph defil it convert it from a
christian church into a place of worship accord to the prophet it
is still veri beauti with a nave aisl and a basilica which
were built by the emperor justinian to serv as a shrine to the
virgin here we were regal with more mahommedan legend a well
be shown to us down which some good man went after a fallen bucket
contrari to everi expect to find himself in paradis also there
ar two column set close togeth and he who cannot squeez between
them ha no hope of heaven it seem howev that so mani stout
moslem got set fast or injur themselv in their mad attempt to
pass where natur curv would not permit that now the practic is
forbidden and the space between the column ha been shut off with a
rail
such folli were not alwai confin to mahommedan howev sinc
felix fabri mention that about the year 1480 there wa a place
between a pillar and a wall i think in the church of the holi
sepulchr through which pilgrim tri to squeez those who
succeed receiv a consider remiss of their purgatori
pain especi promis and guarante by those who had control of
the matter
the pulpit in thi mosqu is a rich miracl of good carv it date
from 1168 and is said to have been present by saladin
leav the mosqu of omar we descend into vast cryptlik vault
which ar call solomon stabl though expert declar that thei
were rebuilt in saracen time it is howev quit possibl that
the hors of the jewish king onc stood in these cavern inde i
have notic how common it is in the east to us cave or underground
place as a stabl probabl becaus these ar cooler in summer
whoever built or rebuilt them certainli the crusad made us of
thi substructur for hole bore in angl of the column can still
be seen through which ran their halter rope in a passag lead to
these vault we were shown gigant block of stone which i suppos
were put in place by phoenician workmen in the dai of solomon that
thei could be move at all without the aid of modern machineri is
littl short of wonder
have inspect everyth at length we emerg by a narrow stairwai
into the open and walk across a great expans of the templ field
to the eastern wall it wa soak with rain but as i went i could
not help rememb that there were period in it histori when it
ha been as wet as thi with blood here in on dai fell 8500 men in a
struggl between the zealot and the parti of john dure the sieg by
titu here too at the conclus of that sieg a motlei multitud
of 6000 were shrivel up in the conflagr of the royal cloister
while 10000 other were slaughter without by the roman soldieri
mount the wall by step built in them we could see beneath us the
vallei of jehoshaphat with it thousand of tomb cover the dust
of jew who have been brought hither for burial a veri ancient
tradit among both christian and moslem tell that here will be
the scene of the last judgment it is found i suppos upon the
vers in joel let the heathen be waken new version let the
nation bestir themselv and come up to the vallei of jehoshaphat
for there will i sit to judg all the heathen new version all the
nation round about multitud multitud in the vallei of
decis for the dai of the lord is near in the vallei of decis
the sun and the moon shall be darken and the star shall withdraw
their shine the lord also shall roar out of zion and utter hi
voic from jerusalem and the heaven and the earth shall shake
then the prophet goe on to tell that thereaft jerusalem shall be
holi and there shall no stranger pass through her ani more
in the dai of felix fabri the saracen of palestin alreadi held thi
belief though the arab place the last judgment at mecca and the
syrian select damascu those who put their faith in the vallei of
jehoshaphat said that there would be three judgesth almighti the
christ and mahomet the first person wa to be seat on the pinnacl
of the templ the second person on the top of the mount of oliv
while the prophet present in the capac of a councillor would take
hi place upon a piec of broken column which to thi dai still
project from the wall of the haram anoth tradit is that christ
and mahomet will be the judg mahomet occupi a place upon the
mount of oliv between the mount and the column span the vallei
of jehoshaphat will stretch a rope over which everi soul must pass
the fate of the wick mai be guess but the righteou will go
across with the eas of a blondin
about thi broken pillari wonder by the wai how it can possibl
have come into it present positionfelix tell a curiou stori with
which i do not rememb meet elsewher not long befor hi time a
certain saracen prophet came to the vallei of jehoshaphat follow by
all the peopl of the citi to whom he promis that he would show to
them detail hitherto unknown concern the last judgment to that
end thi child of the devil climb up to the broken pillar by help
of ladder and seat himself astrid upon it with hi back to the
wall began to prophesi unfortun for himself evid he wa a
preacher with action and forget the danger natur of hi
seat yield to the excit of the moment and began to fling
about hi arm now thi column as we still mai see ha been highli
polish and present there happen to that unfortun expound
of the last judgment an accid such as is apt to chanc to careless
peopl who ride with loos girth suddenli he slip and hi seat
be so smooth wa quit unabl to recov himself on frantic
ineffectu grasp and where hi head had been appear hi heel
then down he came and wa smash like an egg in the vallei of
jehoshaphat a catastroph over which felix doe not seem to griev
the silli peopl he remark were confound and went back into
the citi everi man to hi own home thu did the fals prophet
contrari to hi intent show them the proof not by word but by
deed
felix mention also in anoth volum that in hi dai there wa a
moslem cemeteri in the vallei opposit to the golden gate to which
he wa not allow to approach formerli it seem the latin and
armenian celebr an annual festiv at thi gate through which
our lord is said to have pass on the first palm sundai until at
the instig of the devil the saracen began to buri their damn
dead here after which thei block up the gate

abov face each other in the sick heaven the black ball of the
sun and moon discern by the light of the flare shiver dy

walk along the wall we came to the golden gate which by some is
believ to be the beauti gate spoken of in the act no man goe
through it for it is built up here pass christ while the peopl
cri hosanna and threw palm upon hi path the mahommedan have a
belief that on a certain fridai none know when a christian conqueror
will enter by thi gate and hunt them from jerusalem for ever perhap
that is why thei wall it up in itself the build is strike but i
will not attempt it detail descript expert sai that in it
present form it date from the byzantin period
at length we had visit everyth we were allow to look at and
turn for a while to contempl the whole expans of thi great and
sacr place that ha seen so much and for aught we know ha still
so much to see then we part from our guid and guard with mutual
compliment point in a manner best understood in the east and
return to the citi follow the tortuou line of the via dolorosa
along thi street the saviour is suppos to have born hi
crossinde by tablet and otherwis each station is record to
an inch upon what author i have not been abl to discov still
million have accept and continu to accept the tradit
afterward we visit what is now shown as the pool of bethesda i
cannot sai if it is the true site which ha been claim for other
spring thi is certain howev that it agre veri close with
the condit describ in the gospel mani step lead to thi
darksom poolto be accur there ar two pool the steep of
these step make it evid that no maim or impot person could
have climb down them quickli without assist it is possibl
howev that here were noth but cistern fed by some underground
fountain abov ar the remain of a chapel discov i understand
in the cours of recent excav and built appar dure the
crusad period
our next expedit of import wa to the pool of solomon about
six mile from jerusalem which onc thei help to suppli with water
now the aqueduct is broken and practic the onli water in the citi
is obtain from cistern that ar fill by the rain so long as
these cistern remain clean their water is good but thei ar not
alwai clean also toward the end of summer the suppli fail then
there is much sick
it is said i believ with truth that some year ago the baro
burdettcoutt offer to restor the broken aqueduct at a cost of
about 20000 thereupon the turkish author wish to profit by
thi strang folli of a frank ask for anoth 3000 baksheesh in
return for the honour that must accru to a stranger who at her own
expens propos to provid their citi with a suppli of pure water i
am glad to sai that accord to the stori the baro refus to
submit to thi imposit subsequ after the paus common in the
east it wa intim to her that her origin offer would be
accept to thi she is report to have repli that she had now
spent the monei in build or endow a church in england as a
result jerusalem remain and is like to remain without ani
constant suppli of drink water
here it is the same in everi case a gentleman who is resid in the
citi told me that he had appli for leav to mend at hi own expens
a hole in the road run past hi hous the answer wa that he must
pai for the privileg the sultan it wa explain to him could mend
hi own road if he like or if it pleas hi imperi wisdom could
leav it unmend in the issu he left it unmend
we drove out through the jaffa gate past the hill of evil council
where caiapha and hi colleagu ar said to have decid upon the
destruct of the saviour on a ridg abov stand a torturedlook
windbent tree appar an oak to which juda is report to have
hang himself in the account by bishop arculf as taken down by
adamnan the abbot of the isl of iona upon which he wa shipwreck
on hi return from the east in the dai of the northumbrian king
alfredthat is at the end of the seventh centuryth juda tree wa
shown upon much the same spot arculf howev describ it as a
larg figtre and that it is not still a fig i am unabl to assert
with confid for we did not go close enough to verifi it speci
mandevil 600 year later speak of it as an eldertre but sir
john can scarc be count as an author on thi or ani other
matter
further on we came to the littl build that is shown as the tomb of
rachel of which the site at ani rate appear to have been accept
for mani centuri certainli she must have been buri veri near by
for jacob sai in genesi and as for me when i came from padan
rachel di by me in the land of canaan in the wai when yet there wa
but a littl wai to come unto ephrath and i buri her there in the
wai of ephrath the same is bethlehem
leav bethlehem to be visit on our return we drove to the pool
of solomon thei ar splendid reservoir three of them ly on
below the other fed from the spring known as the seal fountain and
other sourc of the three pool the first is the smallest and the
last which is nearli two hundr yard long by fifti broad and
sixteen deep is the largest i am ignor who built them solomon or
anoth but pontiu pilat is said to have restor them and onc
thei fed jerusalem with water now as i have told the conduit is
broken so the water run no further than bethlehem also i notic
that like everyth els in thi land the pool themselv ar
fall into disrepair thu the sluic connect the two of them i
think the first and second ar broken down so that the water is
forc to find it wai by an overground channel of it own upon the
dai of our visit a furiou gale wa blow which caus the wave to
dash over the retain wall of the pool as though thei had been
born in the depth of a verit sea studi from below the effect
wa veri strike
near to the head of the first pool is a larg castlelik build as
usual in ruin said to have been creat 300 or 400 year ago as a
protect against arab tribe i push the rough door asid and
enter in the gatewai an old goos wa sit which hiss at me
and beyond were the ruin of mani wall and chamber mix up with an
attempt at a muddi garden except for thi goos the place wa quit
desert
from solomon pool we drove to bethlehem now a crowd
narrowstreet littl town for the most part inhabit by
christian in front of the church of st mari which cover the
tradit and as i believ the undisput spot of the nativ of
our lord is a larg flag space border by tomb onc the atrium
of the church stood here but thi ha long been destroi at present
the front look like a blank wall erect by mani builder at mani
ag in mani differ materi and subsequ buttress up were
it not for the littl iron cross stand at the apex of the gabl
none would guess the sacr charact of the build beyond
we pass in by a humbl door that seem to strive to hide itself awai
in the shadow the origin main entranc have been brick up in
past dai i suppos from fear of the turk and bedouin within is a
majest fane rear by the emperor constantin in the year 330 and
i believ in all essenti not greatli chang sinc hi dai
although amongst other restor the roof wa repair in 1482 it
materi be given by edward iv and philip of burgundi the
transept and aps of the basilica have been wall off dure the last
centuri so that all the visitor see as he come in is the nobl
nake nave and it aisl support by pillar each hewn from a
singl rock thi part of the build is remark for it disrepair
and neglect aspect none of the christian seem to wish to beautifi
or preserv it for the strang reason that it belong to all the
christian latin greek armenian each have their share in it
and therefor individu will do noth lest thei should benefit
the properti of their fellowworshipp of anoth shade of faith
such conduct and the constant bitter quarrel that break out between
them here in the church of the holi sepulchr and everywher
throughout palestinewhat an exampl do thei give to the moslem who
stand by and mock at the mutual hate of these christian dog
a gentleman in jerusalem told me that not long ago he found a turkish
soldier on guard in some part of thi church where it wa not usual
for a sentri to be and inquir of him why he wa there he point
to a nail in the wall and repli
it is my duti to watch that nail
ask why he explain that the latin or the greek i forget
which had driven in the nail with a view of hang a pictur that
the rival sect had furious object sai that it wa an
interfer with their properti and want to pull out the nail
that thereupon the turkish govern had interven and set him to
watch the nail and see that no pictur wa hung upon it and that it
wa not pull out to allow the pictur to be hung would have been to
admit the claim of those who drove in the nail to allow it to be
pull out would have been to admit the claim of those who object
to the drive in of the nail therefor the nail must be preserv
and the pictur must not be hung and to see that thi wa so an
arm sentri must watch dai and night for aught i know he mai be
watch still at ani rate the stori is as instruct as it is true
veri much the same state of affair seem to have prevail in the
time of felix fabri who tell us that the greek own the choir the
latin the cave of the lord nativ and the armenian an altar at
the place of the three king offer whether thei all of them then
own the nave and aisl jointli i do not know although i gather
that thei did thi is what he sai
thi church at bethlehem is in it upper part profan and
desecr nor ha it on singl lamp in it upper part neither
in the choir nor in the nave nor in the chapel but it stand
like a barn without hai an apothecari shop without pot of
drug or librari without book the preciou pictur ar
drop from the wall and there is no on to restor them yet
we ar thank that the bodi of the church is still stand
felix who could be veri credul where christian wonder ar
concern relat some strang and pleas stori about thi
church on of them is to the effect that the soldan came to the
place of the nativ to destroi it the destruct commenc
accordingli but the soldan note the excel of the carv
slab and of the column order that thei should be remov to be
put to other purpos thenoh miracl and prodigi meet to be
proclaim among the faithfulwhil the workmen were at the task
under the ey of their master
out of the unbroken solid wall which it seem that even a
needl could not pierc there came forth a serpent of wondrou
size who bent hi head back against the wall and gave a bite to
the first marbl slab and split it with hi fieri tongu
vire acquirit eundofor put upon hi mettl by the smash of
these slab the said serpent leapt next into the chapel of the three
king ran along that highlypolish wall whereon not even a spider
could plant it feet split fortytwo slab in two and disappear
after thi the reader will not marvel that the soldan wa astound
and abandon hi predatori purpos got out of the church as fast
as he could go the track of the serpent howev which look as
though hot iron had been held against the stonesposs thei
had but thi doe not seem to have occur to honest felixremain
in hi dai inde he inform us that i beheld the trace of thi
miracl with great pleasur and often look curious upon them with
inward wonder
to return from wander with the fascin felix after admir
the nave and aisl we pass into the transept and aps where we saw
the gorgeou altar of the variou sect and alongsid the latin
church of st catherin then we went down some step into the chapel
of the nativ it is light by mani lamp of a good size and
marblelin throughout beneath an altar a plain silver star is let
into the pavement and with it the inscript hic de virgin maria
jesu christu natu est
thi accord to all tradit is i believ the holi and
undisput spot of the birth of the saviour upon earth it is best not
to attempt to record the reflect to which the sight of it give
rise each reader can guess them for himself close at hand at the
foot of a few step is a kind of trench line with marbl said to be
the site of the manger in which the lord wa laid the origin of
cours discov by the empress helena have been despatch to
rome if the on spot is authent so doubtless is the other but i
could wish that both of them had been left with a littl less of
ornament and marbl line thi remark howev appli to
almost everi holi site in palestin except that of which i have
spoken of the transfigur upon mount tabor and on other place
not in the church of the holi sepulchr which i hope to describ
present where as i believ christ wa crucifi
afterward we visit more underground cavern such as the chapel of
the innoc where some of them ar said to have been massacr or
buri i am not sure which and the chapel cut in the rock where st
jerom live for mani year and wrote hi work then i return alon
to the chapel of the nativ which i wa so fortun as to find
quit empti and stood there awhil listen to the solemn swell
sound of the chant monk as thei march from shrine to shrine
through the variou cave and passag of the crypt
outsid of thi church a gang of motherofpearl vendor and other
folk who desir to beg or to sell someth threw themselv upon us
furious clamour beseech and pester till we were driven
almost mad with their importun thi is on of the most
persist troubl that the travel must expect in the holi land
he visit some sacr spot which he ha long to see from childhood
and no sooner is he without it door than a crowd of impud scamp
to whom the tradit of that place ar a daili revenu fall upon
him and disturb hi mind and temper
howev we got rid of all of them at lastexcept on littl girl
who simpli declin to be driven awayand walk to a high crest on
the outskirt of the town whenc we saw the wide plain that run to
the dead sea and is bound by the mountain of moab below us
enclos by a wall lai that oliv garden where the angel is said to
have visit the shepherd abid in the field keep watch over
their flock by night and to have given them the good tide of
great joi which shall be to all peopl while abov the heavenli
multitud gave glori to god in the highest and on earth peac
thenc break through the rank of the motherofpearl seller who
now made their last desper attack we drove to david well it wa
from thi well when the philistin held hi citi of bethlehem that
david long for water oh that on would give me drink of the water
of bethlehem which is by the gate then the three mighti men found a
path through the host of the philistin and drew water from the well
and brought it to their princ but david pour it out unto the
lord sai shall i drink the blood of the men that went in
jeopardi of their live
i suppos that the well shown by the gate is the same but if so i
do not think howev thirsti he might be that david would wish to
drink of it water todai sinc all the surfac drainag of the
garden find it wai into it as by kneel and look down the well
i wa abl to discov when question the priest in charg could
give no explan he onli said that it had alwai been so
leav thi mysteri unsolv we drove back to jerusalem on our wai
we pass the field that wa bought to buri stranger in with the
price of the thirti piec of betray and that grim and desol
valleyonc the scene of the abomin of heathen worshipwhich
dure the last 1500 year ha receiv the bone of so mani of those
travel to whom jerusalem ha prove the place of their last
pilgrimag
chapter xx
jericho the dead sea bethani and solomon quarri
the weather wa still veri cold and raini on the morn that we
start from jerusalem to visit jordan jericho and the dead sea
leav at about eight oclock we cross the head of the vallei of
the kedron and drove to the cave on the mount of oliv now an
underground chapel which is said to contain the tomb of the virgin
the tomb of her parent the tomb of joseph and the grotto where the
last scene of the agoni is report to have fallen upon our lord while
hi discipl slept around these differ sacr spot ar in the
possess of the greek the armenian and the abyssinian each of
those sect have an altar here also there is a place of prayer
reserv to the mahommedan it is needless to add that here as
elsewher the variou foundat indulg in their scandal and
discredit rivalri the church li mani feet underground and is
approach by a broad flight of marbl step so illlight that the
visitor will do well if he proce like a blind man tap in front
of him with a stick
on thi morn the crowd and the confus were great for up and
down the step pour two conflict stream of hundr of russian
pilgrim perspir and malodor amongst whom we struggl in the
gloom at their foot a somewhat mercenari monk provid us with
taper by the light of which we inspect the tomb of the virgin it
is cover with a marbl slab worn perfectli smooth by the lip of
pilgrim these good peopl and especi the russian think it
their duti to kiss everi object of acknowledg or reput sanctiti i
have seen them kneel on the road kiss the ground stand
against wall kiss the stone and bow themselv to kiss the
threshold or the door of build
ow to the multitud which surg to and fro the sound of the
sing of the mass i think at two altar the smoke of the burn
taper and the thick atmospher aris from the presenc in that
airless place of so mani piou but unwashen person our visit wa
disturb and unsatisfactori inde i wa glad when we had struggl
up the step again and found ourselv in the cold refresh air
next we walk to the garden of gethseman a spot the ident of
which seem never to have been doubt it is the properti of the
franciscan and enclos by a wall render as hideou as mai be with
stucco and bad pictur although fortun the exist of the
oliv had made it imposs for ani on to cover it with a roof
within the wall is a garden and within that garden the true wonder of
the placeeight oliv trunk still live but of a vast antiqu
here and there built up with stone to support them so ancient ar
these decai tree that take into consider the longev of
the oliv it seem to me possibl and even probabl that amongst
them or other which sprang from the same root the saviour did
inde prai and suffer yet thei still push their leav in spring and
bear their fruit in autumn
preced and follow us round the enclosur were mani more russian
pilgrim i observ them close and note that none of them seem
to look at or pai attent to the sacr spot of ground or to the
gaunt and hollow oliv that grow within at interv on the wall
howev ar place vile represent in plaster relief of variou
scene connect with the passion these ar cover with iron
grate and the pilgrim as thei went stop befor each grate
and kiss it bar it is imposs to watch these peopl without
sympathi and respect still it doe appear almost piteou that thei
should pai so much attent to the outward and visibl side of
thing sinc thi cannot but milit against a true appreci of
the inward and spiritu yet their motiv is pure and good and for
the rest who ha a right to judg
shortli after leav the garden of gethseman we found our mount
bedouin escort wait for us by the roadsid noth that i saw in
the demeanour of ani of the inhabit of the dead sea region lead
me to suppos that the presenc of guard wa a necess but there
thei ar and no travel seem to be allow to go to jericho
without them possibl thi is to be explain by the fact that thei
ar well paid for their servic and in addit receiv a
baksheesh from the object of their protect attent possibl
also if thei were no longer emploi as thei themselv vigor
assert would be the case accid might overtak the pilgrim
without be uncharit i can conceiv even that thei or some of
them might be intim concern in those accid if a
respect bedouin guard ha hi mean of livelihood taken awai from
him who could wonder if he should again relaps into the unregener
state of a disreput bedouin thief
a littl further on situat upon a hillsid to our right in the
midst of sever cavern that have i suppos serv as tomb we saw
the slaughterhous of jerusalem with the butcher at their horrid
work in the full sight of passersbi and the flock of sheep and
other anim wait their turn it wa a most unpleas spectacl
next we pass through bethani without stop as we were to visit
it on our return and at length came to the spot which is fabl to be
the scene spoken of by our lord in the parabl of the good samaritan
and the travel who went down to jericho and fell among thiev
here we rest the hors awhil as the road which for a wonder
had not been made for the german emperor wa steep and slipperi after
the rain although it is the best in palestin and inde by no
mean bad consid the engin difficulti that must have
been overcom in it construct
after leav the khan hadrur the landscap as we drove becam even
more lonesom and extraordinarili wild it is imposs to describ
it better than by sai that it remind me of the mountain of the
moon as seen through a telescop white arid unpeopl with
tower cliff and vast raincut gulli cover with round and
stunt bush show like green wart on the face of the hill
uncultiv and uncultiv the home of hawk and raven and here
and there of a few wander goat that make littl beaten track
upon the mountain side it is the veri ideal of desol a
wilder of wilder at the bottom of a precipit yawn
gulf run the brook cherith here built halfwai up the tower
cliff to which it cling like a swallow nest upon a wall is a
greek monasteri that as i am inform mark the site of the cave in
which elijah wa fed by the raven of thi monasteri david our
dragoman told me a curiou tale he said that onc when he visit
the place an old monk there took him out to the mountainsid
carri in hi hand a basket of crumb and other food here leav
david at a littl distanc he stood still and whistl whereon all
sort of bird wild dove and mani other emerg from the cliff
and brushwood and after flutter round settl on the old man
head and shoulder while he fed them from hi hand sure upon thi
monk must have fallen the mantl of sweet st franci of assisi
now we began to descend precipit slope till the plain of jericho
lai befor us a great expans sprinkl with thornscrub and back
by the mountain of moab unfortun for the most part it wa
drape in mist and cloud which hid the dead sea and blur the
outlin of the hill pass through jericho a horribl foul
villag where the popul ar said to be all thiev and most of
the children seem diseas we drove on to the mound which ar
report to mark the site of the ancient citi whose wall fell down
at the sound of the trumpet as these mound ar distinct and
isol howev it seem quit possibl that thei cover the ruin
of outli tower and fortif
then we visit a fine pool of fresh water which we were inform is
fed by the spring that from bitter wa made sweet by the prophet
elisha after thi we drove back to the villag and our hotel through
flat level land which evid is veri fertil wherev it is
reach and irrig by the water of elisha pool
we had left jerusalem in bitter cold but here although it wa still
earli in the season the air wa hot and sultri hotter even than at
tiberia it is easi to imagin that after their long wander
amongst sand and rocki desert thi vallei of jordan probabl then
in a high state of cultiv with the greater part of it rich soil
irrig from the river and other sourc by the industri heathen
husbandmen would have appear to the jew as a verit promis
land flow with milk and honei person howev it is not a
climat in which i should care to live inde what between heat and
mosquito most european find it imposs in summer
the road or rather track from jericho to the dead sea is bad in
spot especi at certain steep bit where it cross stream or
nullah it is howev wonder what obstacl a jerusalem
rattletrap will negoti in safeti no english driver would dream of
take hi carriag down such place the trail run across an arid
plain impregn with salt and bear a scanti veget here and
there among the bush bloom ranunculi while littl risi of a
peculiarli deep and love hue ar common also mani great eaglelik
birdsi imagin thei ar a kind of kite though what thei all find to
live on i cannot quit understandflit solemnli from thorn to thorn
while porcupin burrow in the sand
everi on at sundayschool or elsewher ha learnt what there is to
learn about the dead sea thei know how it receiv between six and
seven million ton of water daili and evapor as much or more how
it ha no outlet is over 1000 feet deep and nearli 3000 feet below
the level of the mediterranean how it water ar so salti that it is
difficult to sink in them and contain noth that ha life except
the bacillu of tetanu a germ not easili defeat all have heard
also how it is full of asphalt such as is suppos to cover the
remain of sodom and gomorrah and how peopl who bath in it must
rush to the jordan for a freshwat dip lest their cloth should
stick to their skin i will therefor pass over these with other
detail and attempt onli to describ the dead sea as i saw that
wonder lake
leav my companion i walk awai alon past the onli hous upon
these shore a nake framework of pole that onc had been cover
with rush to give shelter in bad weather to travel from jericho
thi habit and it surround seem singularli appropri to
each other at a distanc i stop and sat down to look befor me
stretch mile and mile of sea on great sheet of smooth grei
water break into littl oili wave beneath the wind on it
margin like a fring of skeleton lai a long unvari line of dead
white tree some with the broken bough still on them and fantast
project root mingl with mass of peel brushwood all of it
dbri brought down by jordan in time of flood on either side were
spread the misti mountain to the right rselfeshkha and rs
mers end in the wilder of engedi to the left the ravin of
zerk min there thei tower distort barren desol
finish leagu awai far off and faintli seen in two giant

i rose and look back behind me stretch the wide arid plain
cloth with a scant and thorni veget dy and ashcolour
but tip here and there with an unwholesom arsen green border
it were fortresslik sandi mount fashion and denud by aeon of
sun and storm beyond those again a vast parapet of tortur hill
that might have been scoop and point as thei came whitehot from
the womb of the world where the furnaceblast ar hurrican to be
thrown hiss into a bath of ic and fix to etern stone then
yet further off for the last black background a hang veil of
storm
i turn again and look up a distant gull travel across the
foodless water where he might not stai and a wild duck pass like an
arrow toward jordan there wa no other life abov me spread a dull
sky broken by mountain of mass cloud and between them littl
valleyrift of blue through which the sun shone rare then
rainbear mist blot the peak of moab and hid from my sight
nebo whenc mose onc beheld thi veri scene
the jordan or those pool of it which we visit li three or four
mile from the bank of the dead sea the track thither meander over
flat of halfdri mire through which the hors struggl as best
thei mai their driver carri with them log of wood that thei pick
up upon the shore of the sea to set beneath the wheel in the worst
of the mudhol
at thi season of the year and in contrast to the desert round about
the bank of swift and muddi jordan ar love and refresh to the
ey with their dens growth of willow poplar and tarfa tree clad
in the vivid green of newcom foliag reed bird were to be seen
also and flash past us on of those love halcyon that i note
on the sea of galile
we were told that a baptism wa about to be celebr in the water
of jordan the candid be an american ladi alreadi past middl
ag i doubt the stori but sure enough from the boat which i had
hire in order to row up the stream we saw the parti consist of a
greek priest in hi tall hat a nativ woman with a bath towel or
some garment that resembl it and the candid all look
perplexedli at each other upon the reedi brink of jordan we then
learn that the baptism wa to be by immers so i thought it time
to direct the boatman to move on
we finish our row and return but thing did not seem to be much
advanc there wa the perplexedlook priest there wa the woman
with the mysteri garment and there the candid sit
disconsol on the ground in a kind of a reedi bower we land and
were inform that the ceremoni wa to be delai till after our
departur whereupon of cours we hurri awai
next morn we heard the conclus of the matter from david who had
it from a brother dragoman who remain it appear that the candid
wish to be baptiz by total immers the greek priest who had
been retain for the occas declin thi method sai that he
did not immers and knew noth about that ceremoni he offer
howev to baptiz in the ordinari fashion by the sign of the cross
but so simpl a rite be reject as unsatisfactori thing came to
a deadlock which explain the perplex air of all concern when we
left them after our departur further argument ensu but neither
parti could be move
then it wa when everyth seem hopeless that there happen what
in past dai would doubtless have been set down to miracl suddenli
out of the reed and willow swamp of jordan issu a baptist minist
who so we were inform without warn of the propos rite or
acquaint with the candid chanc to be on the spot and with
a fine profession instinct had hidden himself up to await
develop at the psycholog moment he emerg and offer hi
servic the greek priest wa paid off and depart the providenti
minist all accord to david robe himself in the mat from the
bottom of a carriag and enter the river where the ladi join him
suitabl arrai and cling to the side of the boat for the
current is swift and the water deep everyth wa accomplish
decent and in order
i confess that to me thi incid is full of mysteri first how
could it happen that a christian ladi of that ag should not be
alreadi baptiz can a person be baptiz again whenev the spirit
move him further is it permiss to an individu presum of
the baptist persuas to undergo thi solemn rite as an incid in
a tour to jordan and at the hand of a greek priest as thi ladi had
propos to do lastli there is the question of the substitut whom i
saw andso defici after much experi remain my judgment of
mendid not recognis as a clergyman of ani faith doubtless i wa
mistaken and he wa a minist possibl of high degre still were i
about to be baptiz i should like to make a few inquiri befor i
accept that solemn offic at the hand of a stranger appear
opportun out of the reed of jordan it is hardli necessari for me
to add that i do not tell thi stori with the idea of jest at the
person concern who ha a right like the rest of us to carri out her
religi aspir in such fashion as seem best to her but rather
as a curiou exampl of enthusiasm triumphant in spite of obstacl
brother felix ha much to sai about the jordan and amongst other
thing deal with thi matter of baptism as it appear to him over
four hundr year ago it seem that then a superstit exist and
for aught i know exist to thi dai that those who ar baptiz in
jordan will never thereaft grow old and thi is why thei make such
effort to get to the jordan and baptiz on anoth he instanc
the case of some ladi of hi own parti who bath among the reed
abov us with modesti silenc and devot and far more sedat
than we i could have wish he add in the case of these old
women that the common report might prove true for the peopl sai
that whosoev bath in jordan doe not grow ani older but that the
longer he remain in the water the younger he grow for instanc if
he bath for on hour he grow younger by on hour if for two he
grow younger by two if three by three if for a year he grow
younger by a year but our women comrad would have need a bath of
sixti year to restor their youth for thei were women of eighti
year and upward
it is someth of a shock to the reader to find that brother felix
had ani ey to see how old or young were the ladi in whose compani
he travel and should even allow himself to express a prefer
for the latter state in woman but felix wa veri much of a man after
all although as i judg an exceedingli good on accord to hi
light
he tell also some curiou stori about the sudden terror which it
appear frequent overtook pilgrim who had swum across jordan when
it becam necessari for them to return the task i mai observ doe
not look difficult and if i had been acquaint with the page of
felix befor visit the place i should have like to make trial of
it notwithstand the current he mention on of hi companion
howev a strong swimmer who wa veri nearli drown here and who
alleg afterward that when he wa come to the middl of jordan
someth beneath the water touch him and i wa so much frighten
by it touch that i lost all the strength of my limb and could not
help myself either with my leg or my arm two of the compani made a
second attempt support thi man between them whereon at the same
place he began to sink drag them down with him and wa with
difficulti rescu ultim a saracen mount on a strong hors
cross jordan at a ford a long wai off and brought him back safe
therebi the pilgrim we ar inform gave him much gold for the
price of hi life the adventur wrought a sad chang in the poor
man howev sinc he who wa handsom lusti overbear and
quarrelsom and dislik by mani of hi fellow becam after hi
return from jordan palefac timor humbl and slavish felix
add that he remain sorrow and cast down and as he believ
di befor long he sai also that he himself when swim in
jordan wa smitten with fear but got back safe and that a great
friend of hi suddenli lost all hi strength in the middl of the
river and wa bare save aliv
afterward he discuss the caus of thi phenomenon which he
declar wa the common experi of all pilgrim whether it wa
brought about by certain unnatur and hellish beast who swim up
from the dead sea to bring men to their death or by strong
imagin final he seem to favour a third interpretationthat
it is a punish from heaven becaus swim across is a sign of
wanton and dissolut and the jordan is a place for weep
not for laugh for prayer not for shout for kneel not for
struggl for repent not for wanton
to thi dai so far as my observ goe such must properli no
doubt be the gener thought with refer to the holi land as a
result there the travel see littl that is bright or joyou i
hardli rememb note a young and charm face or even a pretti
dress youth flee that land it shrink from wander where ar no
daili common pleasur noth but solemn sight and pain
memori which call up medit oppress to the spring of life
palestin abov all other countri seem the place of pilgrimag of
folk on the wrong side of middl ag whose interest and ambit
have ceas to be sole or even in the main occupi with the
anticip of what good fortun mai befal them dure the unspent
dai of their earthli sojourn
be thi as it mai the onli sweet and cheer thing in the holi
land where even the nativ children for the most part appear so
grave ar the love flower which for a time smile upon it face
soon to be burnt up and vanish amid those steril hill and rot
ruin these lili of the field suggest to the mind the presenc of a
spirit of promis etern renew although fulfil mai be far
and of a hope that never di though it mai wither almost to it root
in the sear wind of doubt and the long undew season of the
heart thirst and trial
felix mention anoth superstit of which it would be interest
to learn whether ani trace remain to thi dai myself i have heard of
none although now as of old pilgrim bring jar to the jordan and
fill them with it water it is that ship on board of which such
water wa carri were alwai unlucki he tell from hi own
experi that whenev thei were in ani danger at sea the pilot
ran about the vessel search all the belong of the pilgrim for
thi water threaten to throw overboard those who carri it with
their baggag he sai too that he had endur much through be
thu insol search and add that a papal bull wa to be seen
at rome forbid the import of jordan water on pain of the
curs of the pope thi maledict felix suppos to have been
issu in order to put a stop to superstit connect with the us
of jordan water for baptism purpos but were mediaev pope wont
thu to war against such superstit
in the immedi neighbourhood of the dead sea the mosquito were
veri troublesom inde it wa necessari to smoke with vigour and
keep a handkerchief move about the head as a protect against
their venom attack thei did not howev attack us by night in
jericho although i believ that here also a littl later in the
year thei ar a perfect scourg
the morn that we left the vallei of jordan prove veri hot
unfortun also the view from the height abov as on the dai of
our arriv wa obscur by dens steam mist that lai like a
white veil upon the low land and the oppos border line of
mountain although the point of the precipit quarantana soar
abov them thi hill which i did not climb is said upon no ground
that i can discov to have been the scene of the temptat and
becaus of the sanctiti attach to it on thi account wa for mani
gener inhabit by anchorit like those of tabor who live
there in hut and cave
at a place call the apostl well we left our convey and walk
by a steep mountain track to the villag of bethani thi path i
believ follow the line of the old road that which the saviour must
have travel when he went down to jordan to be baptiz reach
bethani we were shown the tomb of lazaru which is said to be the
onli cave in the place that notwithstand it pretti site
overlook a littl vallei and the fertil of it soil seem
todai a veri unpopul villag at the least a great number of the
hous ar unroof and ruin
enter by a low rockcut door we lit taper and descend about
twenti worn and broken step which brought us to a kind of
antechamb or chapel henc about five more step which appear at
some time to have been cover in with a slab brought us to the tomb
itself suppos thi to be the true site whereof there is no proof
it would have been easi for the saviour to stand in the antechamb
and after the stone had been move to call the word lazaru come
forth down the remain step by which it is separ from the
grave but as to the exact local none can speak with sure
although it cannot have been far awai
we visit also the ruin of the hous of mari and martha from the
remnant of carv marbl and the fine qualiti of the stone us in
it wall i imagin that thi dwell must have belong to some on
of wealth and import whether martha or mari ever cross it
threshold is a differ matter probabl it wa built in an after
gener
between bethani and jerusalem onc more we pass the slaughterplac
at thi hour of the dai there were no butcher and no victim but the

awai from it to sleep in the shade while on the dy olivetre
about sat score of fullgorg kite where the carcas is there
shall the eagl be gather togeth as i gaze it wa born in
upon my mind that thu must the court of the templ have appear
upon the morrow of the roman massacr
on of the most interest of the mani sight we saw after our return
to jerusalem wa that of the ancient quarri call of solomon
whenc he is said to have drawn the stone for the build of the
templ i can well believ that thi wa so and as the block were
prepar in the bowel of the earth thu it came about that no sound
of saw or hammer could be heard abov probabl herod and other after
hi dai made us of them also draw the hewn stone up into the
templ area sinc although the present entri to the cave is not far
from the damascu gate thei ar report to extend to beneath the
harem enclosur
few travel or compar few visit that gloomi place perhap
it wa on thi account and becaus he wa determin not to miss on
of the rare chanc which came hi wai that the turk in charg of the
quarri hear that we desir to see them did not wait for us to
arriv but appear at the hotel to fetch us he wa a veri
strangelook person who gave us the idea of have live for year

chapter xxi
gordon tomb and golgotha
anoth place in jerusalem of which so far as i am awar the
guidebook take no notic but that to me wa fascin and
suggest is the sepulchr known as gordon tomb with the garden
wherebi it is surround thi name ha been given to the spot becaus
that great and singlemind man gener gordon when he wa in
jerusalem made it hi custom to come here for prayer and medit
as for the tomb i do not understand that he ever assert it to be
that in which the bodi of our lord wa laid although he wa inclin
to believ thi might be so my inform on the point howev is
of a hearsai order gather onli from what wa told me in jerusalem
thi at least is sure that if the true calvari wa where mani
believ it to have been among them myself on the tradit site of
the place of stone of which i shall speak present few
restingplac could have been more conveni for the entomb of
the divin bodi also the resembl between thi garden with it
grave and those describ in the gospel is remark it mai be
howev that the fact that the place is still a garden and that the
tomb is much what it must have been when it wa hollow out so mani
mani centuri ago give more weight to thi similar than the
circumst warrant
yet it would not be too much to sai that here the scriptur
descript seem entir fulfil the tomb is rockhewn it
appear never to have been finish for some of the surfac have not
been smooth it wa close with a stone when thi stone wa roll
awai the discipl peter and john by stoop down could have look
into the sepulchr and seen the linen cloth lie perhap upon the
floor of the littl antechamb thi tomb too wa a famili tomb
such as joseph of arimathea might well have made with room in it for
three bodi on at the end as it were and recess and two at
right angl veri well might these have serv as seat such as
those on which mari must have seen two angel in white sit the
on at the head and the other at the feet where the bodi of jesu had
lain
who can tell whether or not it is the veri spot but if the true
calvari wa just without the wall on the border of the mahommedan
cemeteri as think otto theniu gener gordon colonel conder
doctor merril and mani more that spot cannot have been veri far
awai at least the sight of it is a great support to the imagin
such a garden there must have been and such a tomb even as we see
them todai in such a place through the dark befor the
daylight must have shone the counten that wa like lightn
and the raiment that wa white as snow for fear of which the
keeper did shake and becom as dead men through just such a garden
dim and dewi must the two mari have crept in terror of the jew or
perhap of the roman guard come to the mouth of the sepulchr as
the first golden rai of morn pierc it with their level shaft
on such a littl terrac as that abov after in answer to the queri
of the messeng she had utter the immort word echo sinc her
dai by so mani million of doubt heart that she wept becaus
thei have taken awai my lord and i know not where thei have laid
him the magdalen might have turn to behold him whom in the shadow
she suppos to be the garden up such step she mai have hurri at
hi summon to be met by the solemn and mysteri rebuk touch me
not for i am not yet ascend to my father
who can sai but stand in that quiet garden with the rockhewn
sepulchr befor me it wa easi to imagin that here and not
elsewher these dread mysteri were enact also other have
believ it in a past alreadi distant over the centr nich where
would have lain the bodi of the lord some dead hand who live in the
crusad time so said the custodian ha drawn a cross in red
pigment and on either side of it paint the greek letter alpha and
omega thi he would onli have done believ that here wa the
verit tomb of jesu of cours howev thi circumst prove
noth and although that cross is old it mai be later than the
crusad
i note anoth curiou and suggest thing about thi tomb in the
rock without hollow from it side the saracen or other cut
manger for the feed of anim some of which remain to thi dai
how strang if the manger which wa connect with the place of the
earthli birth of our lord should also thu have becom connect with
the place of hi earthli burial how strang also if here neglect
in thi old garden unvisit by the mass of pilgrim undeck by ani
pompou shrine or monument should be the true scene of the
resurrect and not yonder beneath the dome on the gorgeou
battleground of the war sect
from thi garden perhap so holi though probabl the truth of that
matter will never be known we went outsid the wall to the
tradit place of stone which is on a knoll in a mahommedan
cemeteri north of the damascu gate and almost abov the old cave
that is call the grotto of jeremiah here it is that st stephen is
said to have been stone although of late the site of hi martyrdom
ha been shift on the edg of the knoll rise a sheer cliff forti
or fifti feet in depth i am told although i have been unabl to
trace the genesi of the statement that it wa the habit of the jew
to throw condemn person off the brink of thi cliff and then if
ani life wa left in them to batter it out with stone here as it
chanc i myself wa stone for in my hurri to look over the edg of
the cliff to me interest for other reason inadvert i
step upon the pillar of an old mahommedan tomb thereon a moslem
ladi on of a group who were seat in the sun bask and gossip
among the grave hurl a lump of rock at me with consider
accuraci and forc help it upon it flight with a vollei of abus
instantli children appear who also began to throw stone at the
christian dog but as we show no concern in time thei ceas
from their amus
thing in thi respect seem to have chang littl dure five
centuri felix fabri caution pilgrim to bewar of step over
the sepulchr of the saracen becaus thei ar greatli vex when
thei see thi done and pelt with stone ani on who step over them
becaus thei believ that our pass over them torment and disturb
the dead
the reason why i wa so anxiou to examin thi place is that i
believ it to be the actual site of the crucifixion and that here
abov the damascu road whenc the passersbi look up and mock at
the dy figur strain upon hi cross onc the bodi of the saviour
hung through those hour of sun and dark what is more like than
that the place of stone should also be the place of crucifixion and
what spot could be more suitabl than thi summit of a cliff where
all might see the suffer of the death of shame
it wa outsid of the citi wall yet near to the citi a man might
bear hi own cross there sinc it seem no further from the place of
judgment than is the church of the sepulchr there is anoth point
to my mind on most suggest the crucifixion ground call
golgotha in the hebrew and calvaria in the latin whenc come our own
calvari mean in either languag the place of the skull all the
evangelist give it thi name st matthew sai a place call
golgotha that is to sai the place of the skull st mark sai the
place call golgotha which is be interpret the place of the
skull st luke sai the place which is call calvari in the
revis version render the place which is call the skull st
john sai a place call the place of the skull which is call in
the hebrew golgotha
from such variou testimoni it mai fairli be conclud that thi
executionground had someth to do with a skull it ha been
suggest that it wa so call becaus skull were left there but
then would it not have been call the place of skull also is it not
admit that it wa the jewish habit to buri the bodi of
malefactor and not to leav them to rot upon the ground as is the
common custom of savag if so the skull would not have remain in
sight anoth suggest is that the shape of the mound mai have
resembl that of a skull but nowher in the bibl is it state that
the crucifixion took place upon a mount although the idea that thi
wa so ha becom gener all that is state all which is quit
certain is that it happen outsid the wall of the citi thu to
put asid other evid it is expressli said in the eleventh vers
of the last chapter of st matthew that some of the watch came into
the citi and show unto the chief priest all the thing that were
done
now as it chanc on the cliff at thi spot believ to be the
place of stone and by mani that of the crucifixion the face of the
rock look toward jerusalem ha undoubtedli a fantast but to
my fanci a veri real resembl to a rot human skull there is
the low corrod forehead there ar two deep hollow that make the
ey there is someth which might be the remnant of a nose and
beneath near to the ground level a suggest of twist and
decai lip i saw the like at onc but on the other hand my
nephew who wa with me could see noth in the same wai three peopl
out of everi four catch the resembl in a photograph of the place
which i brought home wherea to the fourth on an averag it is
invis if two thousand year ago the face of that cliff wa
approxim as it appear todai mai not some fancifulmind jew
have caught thi like and design it on that account the place
of the skull if so in view of it tradit and horribl us the
name would have been like to cling to the site from ag to ag
but wa it the same have weather or the hand of man alter the
appear of the cliff who can sai for my part i believ that save
in the case of strata of except soft a trifl of two
thousand year will not make ani great differ in the appear of
rock especi in such a climat as that of thi part of palestin
where no sever frost come to corrod and split the airharden
stone there remain the question of extranatur interfer men
might have hollow out those eyehol it is howev difficult to
see why thei should have done so the face is steep and not easi to
come at enorm quarri exist within a few yardsthos which i
have alreadi describedwh thei could more easili have obtain
build materi at least no extens cut have been made
sinc the road seem to run where presum it must alwai have run
between the cliff and the citi wall
thi is the case put briefli but as clearli as i can set it out it
is not for an amateur like myself upon the strength of onli two
examin although these were care to be dogmat or express
ani posit opinion and i express none on thi or other disput
site and matter connect with the holi land how can i who
lack an extend experi of these problem must reli mainli
upon my power of observ and deduct such as thei mai be to
guid me to the truth i onli ventur to point out not know
whether or no thi ha been done in work alreadi publish that as
i saw it in the year 1900 the surfac of thi cliff ha a quaint and
ghastli resembl to a human skull taken in connect with the
tradit of that place with it undoubt suitabl to the dread
purpos of public death and with the name by which the true spot wa
known wherev it mai have been i submit that thi resembl is
to sai the least exceedingli suggest
if the infer is not a fals on if inde the cross of the
saviour and the thiev stood upon the summit of that littl cliff it
would be a fact worthi of note that thi patch of earth remain now
just as it must have been in the longdead roman dai what a strang
and bitter satir also would be involv in the circumst that
where the christ gave up hi soul is now a buryingplac of the
follow of the fals prophet in which the pass christian of
todai is curs and stone here i leav the subject ad onli
that on a subsequ studi of thi strang cliff from the roof of an
oppos american school or mission within the wall the skulllik
like wa to my mind even more appar and strike than it had
been when view from nearer point immedi beneath them
unless it be that which is to be seen from the platform of the russian
tower upon the mount of oliv i know of no better view of jerusalem
than can be had by climb to the roof of the new hotel upon some
night when the full moon cloth that ancient holi citi and it
surround hill in a garment of shimmer silver studi it
thenc the travel will understand how inconceiv it seem that
the site of the present church of the sepulchr by tradit the
place of the crucifixion entomb and resurrect should ever
have lain without the roman wall even now the area enclos within
those of todai is not much larger than that engirdl by the
mediaev fortif of famagusta the provinci town in cypru
which i have describ in a previou chapter of thi book to cut awai
the portion which includ the church of the holi sepulchr would
reduc thi small space by about a fourth or even more now allow
that the old town extend somewhat toward the south as the
excav by dr blii and other on the foundat of the wall
seem to prove sure it would be imposs if shorn of thi
section that it could have contain anyth like the number of
peopl who ar said to have found shelter within it gate whether it
could have held them at all inde whatev the exact line of the
wall seem more than doubt josephu tell us war book vii
chap xvii edit of 1785 that in the war of which we ar
speak no less than 97000 person were made prison and the
number of those who lost their live dure it progress wa
1100000
in explan of thi vast total he sai that when cestiu caus a
rough censu of the jew to be taken at the time of the passov it
wa reckon that there were in jerusalem two million five hundr
and fiftysix thousand person all of them in perfect health which
is a popul nearli as great as that of pari and it suburb at
the last censu no wonder he inform us that the multitud shut in by
the sieg wa so immens that the confin air occas a
pestil and thi calam wa soon follow by a famin yet he
add if the calcul of cestiu mai be reli on the citi wa
quit larg enough to have afford accommod to thi amaz
concours of peopl wa it accord to colonel conder a great
author the number of the inhabit of jerusalem in ordinari
time cannot at thi period of the sieg have been more than 30000
it is now about 60000 and veri crowd to add to thi modest
total over 2000000 soul and to assert that such a seeth mass of
human pent within those narrow wall endur a sieg of 143 dai
is to strain the credul of modern investig to break point
sure josephu must have exagger but if we divid hi figur by
five suppos the ground on which is built the church of the holi
sepulchr to have been without the wall in hi dai as must have been
the case if the crucifixion took place there it seem quit
imposs that even the total thu diminish could have found room
to move and fight or roof to shelter them from sun and rain
thi fact appear to me to constitut the best and most complet
argument against the authent of the church of the sepulchr site
sinc all admit that the crucifixion took place without and not within
the citi wall the expert howev can furnish other argument
thu dr merril who ha studi the matter close and i believ
himself carri out excav veri kindli show me the plan he had
made of the foundat of the ancient wall accord to which the
holi sepulchr site would be distinctli includ within them i
gather from him also that he believ the crucifixion to have taken
place at the spot which i have describ alreadi and i think that he
ha mark it thu upon hi plan in hi opinion the saviour carri
hi cross from the hall of judgment not by the narrow and twist
via dolorosa but along a broad militari road that ran to the damascu
gate and thenc to caesarea
on the other hand for some fifteen centuri the church of the
sepulchr ha been accept as the true site therefor the vest
interest if i mai call them so in that site ar consider and
ani attempt to disput it is vigor coldshould by greek
latin armenian and abyssinian alik but when thi tradit is
examin it will be found a hous without foundat accord to
eusebiu befor the time of constantin a templ of venu said to
have been built by hadrian stood upon the site of the church he
appear to have thought also that the cave beneath wa connect with
the worship of thi goddess a vision induc the empress helena the
mother of constantin to undertak a pilgrimag to jerusalem there
anoth vision prompt her to destroi the templ of venu and dig
whereon contrari to all expect the tomb of the lord wa found
beneath also she discov the cross upon which the saviour and
the good thief were execut carefulli buri awai against the hour
of her search as no further vision came to explain which of these wa
the true cross thi had to be determin by experi a ladi sick
to death wa brought to the place and when she wa laid upon the
genuin relic instantli recov her health such put concis
seem to be the sum of the evid in favour of the accept site
the reader will judg of it valu for himself
if he is critic mind howev it mai occur to him as possibl
that when the empress arriv and ask to be shown the notabl place
in jerusalem the pagan inhabit of that dai took her to the ruin
templ of venu then might have come the vision alreadi
characterist of thi good woman the purport of which would have
been nois abroad for the rest is it wonder that if a wealthi
empress wish and expect to find cross by dig at a certain
spot cross should sure enough be found
probabl in jerusalem then as todai there exist enterpris
peopl who appreci monei and were not overburden with scrupl
as to the manner of it win it is hardli necessari to dwell on
the curiou circumst suppos that thei were not place there
readi to st helena hand that these cross of scantlingfor thei
could have been littl more if on man wa to carri themshould have
been thu carefulli preserv and have withstood the damp of the earth
for over three centuri oddli enough howev as colonel conder
point out in hi articl on jerusalem in the dictionari of the
bibl that is edit by dr hast the legend of helena
miracul discoveri of the cross is unnot by contemporari
writer though in ad 326 the mother of constantin visit
bethlehem and olivet the cross itself is onli notic by st cyril
twenti year after the great basilica wa built and in ad 383 by
jerom the stori of the find of the cross is first told by
rufinu in ad 410 and by theodoret about ad 440
therefor it would seem possibl that the whole of thi marvel
tale mai be a legend of a postconstantin period in such case
noth remain to guid us as to the reason of the build of the
basilica by constantin at thi particular spot possibl it wa the
discoveri of the old rock grave which sinc the sixteenth centuri
have been assert to have held the remain of joseph of arimathea and
nicodemu thi tomb of nicodemu by the wai colonel conder
suggest in the articl from which i have alreadi quot mai have
been hollow for a veri differ purpos it is not imposs that
thi monument mai be the real tomb of the king but it is also
possibl that all were buri near siloam within the citi wall and
futur excav mai reveal the sepulchr of david near siloam
among the sea of uncertainti which surg round the sacr relic of
jerusalem it is refresh to stand upon someth that is beyond
doubt even if be clearli connect with the event of bibl histori
we visit the establish of the sister of zion twice and on the
second occas saw everyth that the place ha to show the good
nun ar russian but fortun the ladi who conduct us could
speak french thi church and convent abut on the via dolorosa or
sorrow street which here is span by an arch call that of the
ecc homo where by tradit pilat produc the saviour befor
the crowd sai to them all and to all the gener that were to
follow behold the man whether or no the event happen on thi
spot none can sai but baedek is of opinion that here ar the
remain of a roman triumphal arch that ha been remodel sinc the
dai of the roman in the choir of the church of the sister of zion
howev is a smaller arch which join that span the street and
must at ani rate be veri old
what admit of no question is the ancient pavement which is to be seen
in the basement of the convent thi must date from the roman dai
and in all probabl wa trodden by our lord it is laid in larg
block and on part of it which is compar unworn seem to
have form part of the floor of a courtyard or squar upon three
of the slab ar line and pattern that were evid made us of in
game plai by the soldier these struck me as veri similar to those
which have recent been uncov in the forum of rome where i saw
them on my journei to cypru on of the jerusalem slab ha littl
cup cut in it which mai have serv some purpos in a game not
unlik that of our modern marbl still favour by school children
doubtless the guard gambl on thi court while thei await the
result of the trial of prison in the judgment hall thu while
awai the interv between their hour of duti
evid the court end and the line of the street began at a
certain limit within the precinct of the convent sinc in curiou
contrast to the smooth block polish onli by the constant passag
of human feet those immedi beyond can be seen to be much worn by
the hoof of hors the sister told me also that beneath the vault
of the convent underground passag have been discov recent
which run toward the templ enclosur form doubtless part of
the system of the ancient fortif of the citi these tunnel i
wa unabl to inspect as thei have been close up she said ow to
the bad air and damp that eman from them
on leav thi most interest hous of the sister of zion we
walk through the jewish quarter of jerusalem examin it more
thoroughli than we had found time to do befor the dirt of the place
is truli wonder and it is strang that human be should live
there in health through the scorch month of an eastern summer
still thei do live which speak well for their innat vital the
stamp of the inhabit is much the same as that of the jew of
tiberia although here thei ar somewhat more viril in appear
also their dress is better in certain instanc inde it gave
evid of wealth and a kind of incongru tast mani of these
hebrew i am told like their brethren of tiberia live upon the
chariti of coreligionist in other land
next to the filth of the street i think that the beggar ar on of
the greatest annoy to be met with in jerusalem at certain spot
and notabl near the garden of gethseman on the mount of oliv and
outsid the hous of caiapha and the gate of zion sit miser
creatur cover with sore as lazaru sat at the door of dive who
utter without ceas a low unhappi wail now too as in the dai of
our lord leper roll about the roadwai and exhibit their fester
stump i saw none howev with the skin as white as snow of the
bibl if inde thi form of the diseas still exist their
afflict seem to be of a kind which i have met with in south
africa whereof on symptom is the drop off of the finger and
toe at the joint
onc i had a kaffir servant who wa a leper after thi sort an
excel man in everi other wai but of that unfortun thi is not
the place to write
anoth thorn in the flesh of the travel or rather other thorn
ar the tradesfolk of jerusalem the moment that he emerg from hi
lodg these importun person rush at him as pike rush at a frog
thrown into a pond seek to drag him into their shop and there
digest him or hi cash at leisur at time the excess of their
servil annoy make the temper even of him who is experienc in
wander a thing veri difficult to keep it is rumour that after a
cours of it even blameless and teetot dean have been known to
express irrit in term which would have vex their chapter
chapter xxii
the church of the sepulchr
the best time to examin the church of the sepulchr which for ag
past a vast major of the pilgrim to jerusalem have consid it
greatest and most impress sight is so soon as the door ar open
in the morn befor the swarm of russian have begun to gather
there on the dai of the visit which i am about to describ
fortun for us beyond a few isol individu none of these
appear probabl the rest of them were engag en mass in
travel to jordan or some other distant spot thu it came about
that for a long while we were practic alon in the place to us a
great advantag
thi church or rather the rotunda which preced it wa built in the
year 336 in 614i cull the date from baedekerth persian
destroi it about 620 it wa rebuilt with addit thi wa the
church which arculf saw in or about the year 700 he sai of it in the
cours of a long descript
the church of the holi sepulchr is veri larg and round
encompass with three wall with a broad space between each and
contain three altar of wonder workmanship in the middl
wall at three differ pointson the south on the north on
the west it is support by twelv stone column of extraordinari
magnitud and it ha eight door or entranc through the three
opposit wall four front the northeast and four to the
southeast in the middl space of the inner circl is a round
grotto cut in the solid rock the interior of which is larg
enough to allow nine men to prai stand and the roof of which
is about a foot and a half higher than a man of ordinari statur
the entranc is from the east side and the whole of the exterior
is cover with choic marbl to the veri top of the roof which
is adorn with gold and support a larg golden cross within
on the north side is the tomb of our lord hewn out of the same
rock seven feet in length and rise three palm abov the
floor
more than two centuri later fire twice did the place much damag
and in the year 1010 it wa destroi by the moslem to be
reconstruct in 1075 and afterward greatli ad to by the
crusad in 1187 and 1244 the church wa damag or destroi by
variou unbeliev in 1310 it wa rebuilt in 1808 it wa burnt
down to be rais up again as we see it now in 1810 such is the
stormi and chequer histori of thi remark fane
formerli it had doubl door face south with a consider open
space in front but now on of these ha been wall up pass
through the other almost the first object to be seen is the stone of
anoint whereon the bodi of christ is suppos to have lain it is
not reassur to the rever travel especi if he chanc
never to have studi the subject for himself and to believ that
here wa the unquest scene of our lord death and resurrect
to consult hi faith baedek and to read therein that the stone
ha often been chang yet even as he read he mai lift hi ey to
see as i did two devout pilgrim a man and a woman well on in
year with heav breast and tearstain ey kneel down and kiss
the relic with the utmost passionthat relic which ha often been
chang
near by is anoth stone where it is announc that the women stood
while the anoint of the holi bodi wa in progress a few step and
we come to the rotunda beneath the great dome in the centr of which
stand the sepulchr the reput burialplac of christ contain a
split slab of marbl where hi bodi is said to have lain evid
therefor it ha chang sinc the dai of arculf who told adamnan
that thi tomb is broad enough to hold on man ly on hi back and
ha a rais divis in the stone to separ hi leg in the time
of felix fabri howev as now it wa cover with a slab of
polish white marbl on which mass can be celebr he sai
also
thi cave ha no window nor is there ani light in it save what
come from nineteen lamp which burn in it which lamp hang abov
the lord sepulchr and inasmuch as the cave is small the fire
of the lamp make a smoke and stench which greatli troubl those
who enter the place and remain therein
baedek sai that in the crusad dai the sepulchr sanctuari wa
round with a round tower but alreadi separ into the angel
chapel and the actual buryingplac as it is todai afterward it wa
polygon and in 1555 the nuisanc which felix notic wa remedi
by the pierc of hole in the roof to allow the smoke and smell to
escap todai it is hexagon in shape and the pilgrim pass into
the sepulchr through the angel chapel with it mani lamp which
belong to the differ sect
on on side of the sepulchr the north if i rememb right is a
curiou open in the marbl not unlik that out of which the anchor
chain run in the bow of a steamer through thi hole at the feast of
the greek easter is exhibit the miracl of the holi fire which is
said by the greeksth latin refus to particip in the fraud
after the sixteenth centuryto descend annual from heaven for what
exact purpos i have been unabl to discov from ani author within
my reach howev when it ha descendedor when the priest ha
struck a match insid the sepulchreh thrust a light torch
through the hole from which some privileg person light hi lamp or
candl from thi again other take the fire fight and scream
to be the first and burn their breast to show that these flame
ar harmless till at last the whole vast space is star with the
light of thousand of taper
the miracl is of old stand colonel conder sai of it in the
articl to which i have refer alreadi the strang festiv of the
holi fire seem to have perpetu the pagan firefeast of earlier
daysperhap onc celebr at the same spot howev thi mai be
when bernard the wise who is i think the first to mention it
visit the sepulchr in 867 the custom wa alreadi establish he
sai i must not howev omit to state that on holi saturdai which
is the ev of easter the offic is begun in the morn in thi
church and after it is end the kyri eleison is chant until an
angel come and light the lamp which hang over the aforesaid
sepulchr of which light the patriarch give their share to the
bishop and to the rest of the peopl that each mai illumin hi
own hous
it wa becaus of thi miracl that the caliph hakim is said to have
destroi the church in 1010 the jacobit writer gregori
abulfaragiu the author of the univers histori from the creation
who must have written about 1270 sai
the author of thi persecut that of 1010 wa some enemi of
the christian who told hakim that when the christian assembl
in their templ at jerusalem to celebr easter the chaplain of
the church make us of a piou fraud greas the chain of iron
that held the lamp over the tomb with oil of balsam and that when
the arab offic seal up the door which led to the tomb thei
appli a match through the roof to the other extrem of the
chain and the fire descend immedi to the wick of the lamp
and light it then the worshipp burst into tear and cri
kyri eleison suppos that it wa fire from heaven that fell
upon the tomb and thei were thu strengthen in their faith
realli when he learn the truth of the matter it is not wonder that
in hi turn the caliph hakim wa strengthen in hi indign
against the christian religion and the anoint cheat who practis
such a fraud
in the dai of felix fabri it appear that the head priest wa shut by
the greek into the lord monument with an unlight candl which
he bring forth light with a loud cry and from which all the lamp
ar light but felix although credul at time wa too sensibl
a man to be thu impos upon he sai but it is not light by a
miracl but artifici albeit the ignor mob rais it cri to
heaven prais god as though a miracl had been wrought and so thei
nois it abroad among the peopl even among the saracen he goe on
to tell how that the saracen said that if thi fire wa realli
brought down from heaven and the christian could prove it thei would
be will to be convert
felix narrat a fabl which he call a beauti stori anent thi
fire it is that when narcissu an ancient bishop of jerusalem wa
about to hold servic on easter ev hi acolyt told him that there
wa no oil but be holi and believ and full of faith he sent
for water instead when it came he bless it and fill the lamp
then suddenli by a wondrou power unheard of in ani other ag the
water took upon itself the fat of oil and be light from
heaven made the light of the lamp shine more brightli than it wa
wont to do
thi veri curiou event which chanc under the emperor severu 211
year befor the dai of constantin wa it is suggest the
begin of the miracl which thereaft repeat itself annual
as mai be imagin thi yearli wonder happen in a crowd
churchi believ that 6000 peopl can press into the space beneath
the dome although at the time of write i am unabl to find an
author for the statementi not unattend with danger in 1834
inde a fear catastroph occur of which fortun we have
an account in visit to monasteri in the levant the late hon
robert curzon jun the author of thi interest work wa
travel in the holi land and chanc to be present in the church
upon that dread occas he tell how the patriarch wa carri
out of the sepulchr in triumph on the shoulder of the peopl he had
deceiv and how overcom by the smoke and smell three unhappi
wretch fell from the upper rang of galleri and were dash to
piec on the head of the peopl below an armenian girl dy in
her place mere of heat and fatigu
afterward mr curzon and hi parti set out to return to the convent
where thei were lodg the soldier of their escort make a wai for
them when he reach the station tradition occupi by the virgin
dure the crucifixion he saw a number of peopl ly on the floor of
the church at first he thought that thei were rest but at length
come to a great pile of them perceiv that these were dead bodi
now i must quot sinc noth can give a better idea of thi fear
event than the word of the eyewit who describ it detail
mani of those whom he took to be peac sleeper were he found
quit black with suffoc and farther on were other all bloodi
and cover with the brain and entrail of those who had been trodden
to piec by the crowd at thi time there wa no crowd in thi part
of the church but a littl farther on round the corner toward the
great door the peopl who were quit panicstruck continu to
press forward and everi on wa do hi utmost to escap the
guard outsid frighten at the rush from within thought that the
christian wish to attack them and the confus soon grew into a
battl the soldier with their bayonet kill number of faint
wretch and the wall were spatter with blood and brain of men
who had been fell like oxen with the buttend of the soldier
musket everi on struggl to defend himself or to get awai and in
the mle all who fell were immedi trampl to death by the rest
so desper and savag did the fight becom that even the
panicstruck and frighten pilgrim appear at last to have been more
intent upon the destruct of each other than desir to save
themselv
mr curzon then tell of hi own fight for life and of hi hideou
struggl with on of the pasha ibrahim colonel whom in the end he
overthrew the offic di where he fell but mr curzon found hi
leg again and succeed in win hi wai back to the sacristi of
the cathol and thenc to the room adjoin the church which had
been assign to him by the monk he sai the dead were ly in
heap even upon the stone of unction and i saw full 400 wretch
peopl dead and live heap promiscu on upon anoth in
some place abov five feet high
the site of the church of the holi sepulchr ha wit mani
tragedi dure the last fifteen centuri but few of them can have
been more terribl than that of sixtyf year ago which mr curzon
describ yet from easter to easter still the miracl goe on
here i must explain for the benefit of those reader who mai be
unacquaint with the condit which prevail at jerusalem that thi
church of the sepulchr is the joint possess of variou christian
sect who have held their rite in it for mani ag in or about the
year 1342 the travel bertrandon de la brocquir lord of
vieuxchteau write in the church of the holi sepulchr resid
also mani other sort of christian jacobit armenian
abyssinian from the countri of presterjohn and christian of the
girdl
to come to a later ag we have evid on the point from the pen of
the rev henri maundrel who wa elect chaplain of their aleppo
factori by the compani of levant merchant in 1695 and who di while
still a young man at aleppo in 1701 in the interv he visit
jerusalem and wrote an interest and valuabl account of what he
saw speak of the church of the holi sepulchr he sai that in
these place almost everi christian nation ancient maintain a
small societi of monk each societi have it proper quarter
assign to it by appoint of the turk such as the latin greek
syrian armenian abyssinian georgian nestorian coptit
maronit c in hi ag howev most of these commun had
been tax out by the oppress of the turk so that onli the
latin greek armenian and coptit were left as in our time each
of these fratern had it own altar and sanctuari where thei
possess the right of celebr their servic to the exclus of
all other he continu
but that which ha alwai been the great prize contend for by
the sever sect is the command and appropri of the holi
sepulchr a privileg contest with so much unchristian furi and
animos especi between the greek and latin that in
disput which parti should go into it to celebr their mass
thei have sometim proceed to blow and wound even at the veri
door of the sepulchr mingl their own blood with the
sacrific an evid of which furi the father guardian show
us in a great scar upon hi arm which he told us wa the mark of
a wound given him by a sturdi greek priest in on of these unholi
war who can expect ever to see these holi place rescu from
the hand of infidel or if thei should be recov what
deplor contest might be expect to follow about them
see even in their present state of captiv thei ar made
the occas of such unchristian rage and animos
if the actual conflict describ by maundrel have ceas the spirit
of them remain and well mai we echo the question which conclud hi
remark the quarrel of the christian sect ar the object of the
continu wonder and mockeri of the moslem master of the holi
place whose busi it is to criticis and control them
i imagin that few visitor who care to take the troubl to think
even if thei have never question the authent of the site can
return faithwhol from an inspect of the holi sepulchr the monk
of variou persuas and differ period have made the mistak of
leav noth to the imagin thu in addit to about a dozen
chapel dedic to sundri saint and suppos to be connect with
them in thi wai and in that and to the great greek cathedr the
catholiconin itself a fine build but to my tast much mar by
it profus and tawdri ornamentationther ar mani other sacr
spot each of them fix to a hair breadth
thu we have the centr of the world accur if unscientif
determin and the place of the burial of the skull of adam who wa
construct of clai taken from thi local then we see the mount of
calvaryth reader will rememb by the wai as i have point out
that nowher in the bibl is it said that calvari wa on a
mountbeneath which adam wa inter until the blood flow from
the cross brought him to life again melchisedec too wa buri
here and the socket made for the cross in the rock ha been carefulli
preserv and is now line with silver also the pilgrim is
shownand if he is a russian kiss the placewher stood the
cross of the two thiev next there is an underground chapel call
that of st helena where the cross wa found near the altar too is
a seat in which the empress helena sat while the cross wa unearth
unfortun for the genuin of thi relic as the coldblood
baedek point out an armenian patriarch of the seventeenth centuri
complain in hi dai that he had frequent been oblig to renew
thi seat becaus the pieti of pilgrim led them to bear it awai
piecem he add doe the sceptic baedek some explor regard
thi chapel as part of the ancient citi moat
to thi dai pilgrim plai the same prank as poor father barnab told
me of on mount tabor almost with tear inde if left alon thei
would carri off the whole place in thi chapel of st helena and on
the staircas lead to it i saw name scribbl upon the wall
greatli did such conduct scandalis brother fabri a hater of
selfadvertis and abov all thing a gentleman he tell how
vaniti led some noblemen to inscrib their name with the token of
their birth and rank on the wall of the church and even to paint
their coat of arm and cut their initi with mallet and chisel on
the pillar and marbl therebi vex and scandalis all men he
add
i have seen some vainglori nobl whose pride had brought them
to such a pitch of folli that when thei went up into the chapel
of mount calvari and bow themselv down upon the holi rock
wherein is the secrethol of the cross thei would pretend to be
prai and within the circl of their arm would secretli
scratch with exceed sharp tool their shield with the
marksi cannot sai of their nobl birth but rather of their
silli for a perpetu memori of their folli but thi thei
were forc to do secretli for had the guardian of the holi rock
whose name is georg seen them do so he would have drag
them awai by the hair of their head the same mad move some
to inscrib their name shield and armori bear with sharp
iron on the slab which cover the tomb on the most holi sepulchr
of the lord
felix goe on to describ in delight languag the feel of the
devout and simplemind pilgrim like himself when he came across
the trace of all thi industri appar it induc him to curs
and to swear and to express angri hope that the engrav would come
to total grief or at least lose hi hand and to petit the
almighti that he would be pleas to see to the matter on is glad to
learn though elsewher i have read otherwis that german nobl
alon follow thi evil fashion which often caus poor fabri their
fellowcountryman to blush for them both among christian and
pagan for as the proverb which he cite sai neatli enough the
hand of fool befoul the side of the hous on fool in
particular almost drove him mad for he wa as fond of write hi
name as that monarch of whom it is told that arm with a piec of
chalk he might be met rush breathless from room to room of hi
palac while after him struggl attend whose busi it wa
for a suffici reason dilig to appli the spong and blot out
the royal composit on is glad to learn that he the pilgrim not
the king came to a bad end so that hi kinsmen and friend would
have given much gold could thei have wipe out hi name from the earth
which he had been at such pain to paint up everywher
i fear howev that he ha left mani descend and it ha been my
lot to studi their signsmanu and work of religion prose poetri
and humour not onli at home but in everi distant land and in everi
famou or sacr place which i have visit throughout the world with
felix i prai that writer cramp of the most virul natur mai
paralys their scribbl finger
besid those which i have enumer here ar mani other place to
be seen for instanc the chapel of the forti martyr the chapel of
st jame the chapel of st thekla the chapel of the archangel
michael the chapel of st mari of egypt and the chapel of mari
magdalen in the church itself too ar more site such as the spot
where the lord appear to mari magdalen the column of scourg
the footprint of christ the prison of christ the chapel of the
crown with thorn the chapel of the rais of the cross the
column of deris and the chapel of st longinu
longinu by the wai is fabl by the monk of the sixth centuri and
their successor to be that roman who pierc the side of the saviour
with hi spear and wa recov from the blind of on ey by the
blood which fell upon it afterward he becam a christian and a
saint near to thi chapel is anoth of the part of the raiment
and so forth
i do not dwell in detail upon these variou spot and their tradit
becaus to be plain i have no faith in them even if it be admit
that the church of the holi sepulchr doe cover the place of the
crucifixion and it attend event which i believ to be most
improb it is beyond credenc that all these local should be
known with such exactitud moreov mani of them have been chang
dure the passag of the centuri their detail architectur and
other can be studi in ani book of refer as for the gener
effect produc upon a visitor by so much ornament so mani
candl and such a divers of occurr miracul and
spiritu said to be concentr beneath these roof it is i
confess bewild dai must be spent there befor all the
compon part becom clear to the mind in their proper sequenc and
those dai mani would prefer to devot to other object to them of
greater interest
what i wa veri glad to see howev were the sword spur and the
cross worn by godfrei de bouillon which ar shown in the latin
sacristi especi the sword a plain weapon of the ordinari
crusad form wherewith he is said to have halv a giant saracen as
easili as a juggler sever a silk handkerchief godfrei it will be
rememb wa the hero of the first crusad and after the captur
of the citi wa elect king of jerusalem thi titl he declin
sai that where the saviour wore a crown of thorn he would have
none of gold and in place of it took that of baron of the holi
sepulchr he di or wa poison in the year 1100 ag onli
thirtyeight and in thi church hi grave is shown it is someth
of a shock to read in baedek hard to be convinc that these
relic which look old and authent enough ar antiqu of
doubt genuin but what is there in thi church that is not
doubt
not on of the least interest sight of thi ancient place
hallow by so much suffer so mani tradit faithfulli believ
in for fifteen centuri and the prayer of ten of thousand of good
and earnest christian is from some retir nook beneath the
rotunda to watch the behaviour of the variou visitor there is the
superior person who know all about it and sai so in a loud voic
wave hi guidebook at sundri architectur detail which he
explain for the benefit of the unlearn sometim by a trifl
confus tack the wrong descript on to the object under view
yonder stand the glib dragoman rattl off hi tale with the
unconvinc facil of a parrot next come russian pilgrim piou
happi folk who know no doubt whose faith is built upon a rock if you
were to suggest to these that thi wa not the real spot of the
crucifixion and the rise of the saviour probabl thei would look
upon you as an emissari of the antichrist or at the least an
infidel with sigh and tear and beat of the breast such as those
of the publican in the parabl thei go by genuflect kiss
prostrat themselv while the learn person of whom thei take no
notic point them out and discours upon them as though thei were
wild anim
then appear anoth partythre ladi two gentlemen and a youth of
about twelv transatlant in origin and beautifulli dress all of
them their hand in their pocket thei stroll down the church of the
crusad chatter loudlybut everi on chatter here it is the
pleas habit of the place what doe surpris and make the observ
in hi corner wonder if he see aright is the fact that the two
gentlemen of the parti wear their hat the head of the youth be
adorn with a brilliant fez the middleag inhabit of these
island who do what he will cannot altogeth keep himself up to
date rub hi ey rememb that ever so mani year ago he wa
taught to take off hi hat even in a tramp lodginghous if mr
and mr tramp were at home and that the same rule might fortiori
be suppos to hold in what is after all the oldest and by mani
the most vener fane dedic to the almighti in all christendom
even if these visitor to that place had no belief or rever for
it master it might still be suppos to hold
ultim thi particular parti still cover advanc to the door
of the chapel of the angel and the holi sepulchr david our
dragoman a man of mild and inoffens manner sprang from hi seat
mutter someth it appear that as a nativ christian of
jerusalem he ha certain right in the holi sepulchr
what ar you go to do i ask
knock their hat off he answer and push through the littl
crowd of russian david place himself at the low door of the chapel
of the angel quit prepar for action
whether it wa that the gentlemen saw someth threaten in hi
ey or as wa also suggest that the entranc be so low it
prove more conveni to pass it uncov i know not at least
thei remov their hat so david wa not oblig to resort to a
violenc which i am sure is foreign to hi natur anyhow hi
determin to us it if necessari sent him up under all the
circumst at least fifti per cent in my estim
the holi sepulchr appar did not interest them much and the
pilgrim emerg almost as quickli as thei went in replac their
headgear as thei came then a realli good idea struck them the
ladi on gentleman and the hope in the fez arrang themselv
in an artist group over against the sacr build with the wall
of the dome for a background while the other gentleman with much
prepar unslung hi kodak focuss and photograph them oh
that felix fabri had been there to see and could have bequeath us
hi impress of that inimit scene as for myself feel my
temper get the better of me and not wish to be involv in an
unseemli disput i left the church
chapter xxiii
the mount of oliv and the wail of the jew
we visit mani other place in jerusalem but few of these impress
themselv much upon me princip becaus i could not bring myself
to believ that there wa even a probabl that thei had to do with
the event which ar report to have happen in them thu there is
a fine armenian church which as a church is worth look at where
st jame is said to have been behead he mai have been but i can
discov no suffici evid of the fact all that the bibl a
muchneglect book of refer sai about it is that when herod the
king stretch forth hi hand to vex certain of the church he kill
jame the brother of john with the sword well it mai have happen
here in thi church there ar old porcelain picturetil which ar
realli veri curiou
then there is the hous of caiapha now an armenian monasteri where
we saw an altar said to be made of the stone which close the
entranc to the sepulchr of christ thi same stone is also to be
seen in the chapel of the angel in the church of the holi sepulchr
a difficulti which fabri get over by state that the faith cut it
into two by the wai in hi time pilgrim stole fragment of that
stone almost more greedili than anyth els a companion of fabri
bribe on of the armenian guardian with two ducat to break a piec
from it which the pair of them did by stealth in the dark thi
knight di at seasur the armenian guardian should also have
di but perhap he didand felix evid much to hi delight
inherit the fragment which he took home with him to ulm in thi
monasteri also we were shown a littl cell where the saviour is said
to have been imprison befor hi trial also the place where peter
deni hi master and the tomb of mani armenian patriarch the last
ar undoubtedli genuin for the other site there seem to be no real
author although much as thei ar todai thei were all of them
shown to pilgrim in the time of fabri in a few brief line baedek
dispos of their claim
anoth note build is the coenaculum or the chamber of the last
supper now a mosqu but evid from the style of the architectur
formerli us by christian of the crusad period probabl as a
church we know that everi build in jerusalem ha been destroi
onc if not more often sinc the time of our lord and thi fact is
fatal to ani illus connect with an upper chamber stand in the
year 1900 and exhibit even a stone upon which the saviour is
report to have sat at the last supper the place howev ha mani
tradit for instanc the virgin is said to have di there also
it is the reput scene of the descent of the holi ghost upon the
apostl lastli in an adjoin room is a coffer cover with
embroid cloth alleg to be a copi of the sarcophagu of david
who as the moslem declar is buri in the vault beneath all
author report that it is compar modern nor wa i
suffici interest to attempt to see it to do which it moslem
guardian must be rather heavili insult by the travel
christian
all we know is that somewher in the citi of david david wa buri
somewher stood that upper chamber where were utter the immort and
immortalis word record by st john somewher rose the palac of
caiapha where jesu christ wa mock scourg and crown with
those thorn that symbolis the lot of all human whether it wa
here or 100 yard or 500 yard distant what doe it matter it
matter noth at all
a more interest expedit to my mind is to hire hors and ride to
the mount of oliv by wai of the vallei of hinnom thi is a
desol waterless place associ with mani an ancient evil
memori whereof it wa prophesi that thi place shall no more be
call tophet nor the vallei of the son of hinnom but the vallei of
slaughter here is that tophet which is the vallei of the children
of hinnom which josiah destroi when he brake in piec the
imag and cut down the grove and fill their place with the
bone of men that no man might make hi son or hi daughter to
pass through the fire to molech
from thi vallei hinnom we get the name gehenna a synonym of hell
and near to it is the aceldama or hous of the field of blood where
for gener pilgrim have been buri henc it is easi to see
how as dr bliss inform me he had prove by hi excav the
ancient jerusalem must have stretch much further in thi direct
than doe the modern town the natur lie of the land and the
defenc provid by the posit and fall of the vallei make it
almost imper that thi area should have been includ in the
wall follow round it we came to the pool of siloam now an
evilsmel mudhol from which hold a handkerchief to my face
i wa glad to escap as fast as my hors could carri me
after ride for some distanc along the vallei of jehoshaphat we
began the ascent of the mount of oliv and follow a steep and
narrow path came to the russian church and hospic which stand upon
the summit build belong to the russian ar numer in the
holi land when look at them it ha more than onc occur to me
that in the case of new troubl in that region their stout wall and
tower would form veri servic coign of vantag to a power which
for religi if for no other reason would not be avers to
establish itself on the coast of palestin inde although i
have littl to go on beyond the result of my own observ i
believ that the erect of so mani hospic and kindr
establish ha a steadi polit purpos quit distinct from ani
present piou and charit us of these edific those who live mai
see it develop befor thei ar older by twenti year
close to the church stand a belvider tower which must be quit a
hundr and fifti feet high and is built in six storei to it top
where if i rememb right bell ar hung those whose head ar
strong enough mai climb by a circular wind stair of iron protect
with a singularli low and ineffici handrail over which it would be
easi to pitch in a fit of vertigo i content myself with stop at
on of the lower platform whenc the view wa magnific
below were stretch the vallei of jehoshaphat mount moriah crown
with it mosqu and the hill of zion everi detail inde of
wall jerusalem with the rug mountain and vallei that lie about
her still more wonder is the prospect to the east for there four
thousand feet below gleam the misti water of the dead sea encircl
with stoni hill and separ from jerusalem by leagu of the most
desol countri to be found in all the earth there too a green
streak drawn as it were across a drabcolour piec of paper run
the river jordan and beyond it rise dim mysteri mountain where
mose onc stood to gaze upon the promis land altogeth the scene
wa worth the climb up that uncomfort and insuffici stair from
the top whenc poor david return exceed dizzi it must be even
more impress
leav the russian build we rode to the chapel of the ascens
sinc the seventeenth centuri thi ha been in the possess of the
mahommedan although the variou sect of christian have prayer
recess within it wall and on great occas ar permit to
hold servic accord to their respect rite a moslem custodian
show us the place point out the footprint of christ said to
have been impress upon the rock as he rose heavenward which sai
baedek must have been frequent renew by the footprint is a
small round hole and as our guid seem thoroughli convers with
all the circumst surround the ascens i ask him what it
wa and how it came there not in the least abash he repli that
when the hadji went up to heaven he had hi walkingstick in hi
hand with which he struck the rock as he sprang from it leav the
mark we see todai i thank him veri much for thi interest
inform and we part with mutual regret
in thi connect the reader mai rememb that the site shown from
the earliest dai on the mount of oliv doe not talli with what we
ar told in scriptur st luke sai and he led them out as far as
to bethani and he lift up hi hand and bless them and it came
to pass while he bless them he wa part from them and carri
up into heaven now bethani li some wai beyond the mount of oliv
at a greater distanc from jerusalem whither it is especi state
the discipl return with great joi
from the chapel of the ascens we went to the church of the lord
prayer that it is said the saviour repeat to the apostl on thi
spot the build consist of a chapel and a quadrangl enclos an
open space and surround by cover cloister on the wall of which
ar marbl slab with the lord prayer engrav upon them in over
thirti differ languag thi grace and origin build wa
set here in 1868 at the expens of a certain princess latour
dauvergn who ha now been some few year dead long befor her dai
howev inde befor that of saewulf who live about 1100 a church
stood here which he describ by tradit as have been veri
beauti until it wa entir destroi by the pagan in the
centr of the south cloister is a lifes marbl of great artist
merit repres the princess herself as she imagin that she
would be after death her bodi howev doe not lie beneath near by
to thi monument is an urn contain the heart of her father and a
slab with a long passag concern him transcrib from some
historian
leav the cloister we were guid by the sister in charg on of
the littl commun of nun who live here to the chapel which wa
built also by the princess latour observ wide and danger crack
in the wall i ask why thei were not mend whereupon almost with
tear the good sister told me a sad stori it seem that the
princess who wa a woman of larg wealth after she had built the
church and court contribut from year to year suffici for their
upkeep and for the necess of the nun further she announc her
intent of endow the establish but death came upon her veri
suddenli befor she had time even to make a will and those who
inherit her possess seem to have recognis no respons
in connect with what thei mai have consid a freak of the
depart
the result is that the few sister who remain in the convent ar quit
penniless and live on chariti and what thei can earn by the make of
butter to sell in jerusalem so deep is their poverti inde that
thei ar truli grate for ani trifl which the pilgrim choos to
bestow upon them wors still if anyth can be wors the princess
wa cheat by her builder and the wall of the church ar crack
veri badli ow to the insuffici of their foundat so that
unless fund ar forthcom to carri out extens and necessari
repair the whole place must er long fall into ruin if by chanc
these line should come under the ey of ani coreligionist of these
good sister who ha the wealth and the will to help them in a
distress which is none of their own make i can assur him or her
that the work will be as good as it is need
thi stori is a poignant exampl of the common folli of
procrastin where the welfar of other is at stake the poor
princess should have studi her montaign and learn wisdom from
him whatsoev i have to doe befor death all leasur to end the
same seemeth short unto me yea were it but of on hour somebodi not
long sinc turn over my writingt found by chanc a memori
of someth i would have done after my death i told him as inde
wa true that be but a mile from my hous and in perfect health
and lusti i had made hast to write it becaus i could not assur
myself i should ever come home in safeti a man should ever as
much as in him lieth be readi boot to take hi journei and abov
all thing look he hath then noth to doe but with himself
truli word of sens which all of us would do well to learn by heart
descend the mount of oliv we went for a ride round a great part
of the wall of jerusalem so far as the damascu gate and back again
to the neighbourhood of that of jaffa here we dismiss our hors
and as it chanc to be fridai walk through a new set of even
filthier lane than ani with which i had made acquaint to the
place of wail of the jew it is a strait place in front of a
fragment of the ancient wall which measur between fifti and sixti
feet in height the lower cours of thi wall ar here built up of
vast stone laid with what unheardof labour no man will ever know
as i suppos in the time of solomon
face the wall about a score of jew men and women of all ag were
engag in wail the women realli wept with interv for repos
but the men as strang a collect of human be as ever i saw
did not give wai to their feel to that extent thei rub their
face against the huge block which occasion thei kiss or read
from the scriptur or mutter prayer on tall pale man attract
my particular attent he wa clad in what look like a dirti
nightgar surmount by a veri greasi fur cap thrust hi nose
liter into a crack in the wall he rock hi bodi backward and
forward peck at the caviti like a nuthatch at the bark of a
tree while he repeat prayer with the utmost fervour when we
arriv he wa thu emploi nor had he ceas from hi devot as
we depart even when a visitor walk up held a camera to hi head
as though it were a pistol touch the button and return remark
got him he show neither surpris nor anger
thi scene is often describ as touch person i found it
grotesqu even to sad in look at these jew mani of whom i
am told live upon chariti there aros in my practic western mind
the word of the old sai god help those who help themselv if
it pleas them to sai their prayer in public although as i think
the practic must be compar recent for i do not rememb ani
allus to it in the write of the earlier pilgrim by all mean
let them do so but sure thei might add to them other more practic
attempt to recov the heritag of their race for instanc thei
might persuad their wealthier brethren to bui out the turk there ar
a dozen gentlemen on the london stock exchang who could do thi
without much individu inconveni why do not the hebrew famili
put to thi purpos a portion of the rich which certain of them
possess in such abund sure it is onli a question of price and
in such a caus mere monei should not count ar thei held back by
indiffer and apathyor perchanc by the mysteri chain of
some divin decre or thei might drill bui arm and make an
insurrect i am inform howev that thei prefer to await the
advent of their messiah a man of blood and power a jewish napoleon
who when he appear will bring about the glori and tempor
advanc of the race
to return if thi ceremoni of wail is imper why is it not
celebr at night it is inconceiv to me that peopl so earnest
as these poor jew doubtless ar can carri on their devot with a
mind undisturb by such surround as i saw all about the
princip actor and mix up with them wa a motlei crowdbeggar
halt maim and diseasestricken boi who drew down their eyelid
within six inch of your face to reveal the shrivel ball beneath
men with tin the size of a halfgallon pot which thei shook befor
you howl and vocifer for baksheesh and hoc genu omn
then to complet the pictur in the background a small crowd of
european and american sightseer with their dragomen some seat on
box or rough bench other stand in group laugh smoke
and photograph the more noteworthi charact imagin men who will
submit to it all imagin also what those fierc old hero who held
that wall for so long against the might of rome would think and sai of
these descend if thei could see them thu mock and humili at
it foot to on who like the writer in mani wai admir and
respect the jew who moreov ha the deepest sympathi with him in
the cruel suffer and obloqui which for ag have been and ar
still heap upon hi ancient chosen race such a sight is noth
short of pain for my part were i born to thi heritag i had
rather make my petit in some rathaunt cellar such as must be
open even to the poorest
yet their final chant which i did not wait to hear for the sight
sound and smell of the place were too much for me must be rather
fine here is the translat of on of them accord to baedek

thi wail of the jew is the last sight that i saw at jerusalem
sinc at a desper earli hour on the follow morn we bid
farewel to the citi of david also veri regretfulli to david the
dragoman with whom we had a tender part at the station i can
recommend him most confid to ani travel in the holi land who
i am sure would find in him an intellig and what is more a
strictli honest guid
it is not probabl that i shall look upon jerusalem again but i am
glad exceedingli to have visit thi ancient and most sacr town
were you not disappoint with the holi land is a question which
the return travel is often call upon to answer for my part i
wa not in the least disappoint inde it live and perpetu
interest came home to me more close than i had dare to hope
i know that mani travel ar wont to give a differ answer but i
submit respectfulli that thi is becaus thei do not dig deep enough
with the trowel of the imagin thei suffer their mind also to
be disturb by the crop of petti annoy and disillusion
which dog the feet of the pilgrim the beggar the extort the
play wai of the turkish author the difficulti of eastern
travel all these distract and worri them till at last thei begin to
lose grip of the root of the matter which send it fibr through
everi vers of the old and new testament and bear fruit in the
scheme of our christian faith also in mani instanc the countri and
it associ depress them a daili consider of site and
scene connect with the mighti career of jesu christ and with hi
divin and fathomless sorrow upon earth in itself tend to overwhelm
the spirit if the spirit is of that order which strive to
understand to appreci or to reconstruct mani abandon the task
other have not the qualiti necessari to it attempt still for
those who can overcom these obstacl who abov all can sweep awai
doubt strangl web who can lift the curtain of the gener
and see afar the lamp of etern truth burn howev dimli a
sojourn in the holi land is on of the highest and most excel of

i repeat therefor i am thank that it should have fallen within

more clearli the mean of those fate messag that ar written
there which in the futur as in the past must constitut on of the
most earnest and import studi of mankind the land we leav
behind us but if we have travel it aright it immort lesson
will endur
when after six hour crawl through stormi weather the travel
from jerusalem final arriv at the jaffa terminu hi first eager
question is what of the sea o cook what of the sea month befor
i had put the same question to the stationmast at chare cross
and here in thi far place the answer wa much the same moder
wa the dispirit repli and now as then i knew that troubl wa
ahead of us
nor wa i mistaken there a mile or more from land roll the
russian steamer that wa to convoi us to port said and there too
lai none other than the familiar flora which bore us from egypt to
the shore of cypru think to earn a littl extra profit the
agent of the austrian lloyd had collect a parti of cyprian
pilgrim purpos to dump them ashor at jaffa and proce to
alexandria in time to ship the outward mail but jaffa is not a port
to be treat in so cavali a fashion and thu it happen as it
ha happen ten thousand time befor that the sea got up and the
pilgrim could not get off
the flora anxiou to proce upon her voyag and alwai consciou
of await mail kept up an incess bellow with her siren but no
on took the slightest notic of these passion appeal not a boat
dare to attempt the ey of stormi water which foam through the iron
reef either the flora must wait till the sea fell or take her
pilgrim on a grati trip to port said whenc thei would claim to be
return at the compani expens in the end after steam about
disconsol till nightfal put to sea and return again just
to fill in the time she chose the latter altern and depart
with a swan song of farewel hoot that probabl echo with some
accuraci the state of the temper of all on board on consol we
had howev our ship could not depart sinc she carri five
hundr russian pilgrim whom she wa bound to land even if she
roll her topmast out off jaffa for a week on end
the few sight that i have describ in a previou chapter onc seen
jaffa from a travel point of view becom a hopeless place
recognis thi we proceed to spend the dai in do noth as
comfort as possibl by walk out of the din and smell of the
town to the lone beach abov here we sat down upon a bed of love
cockleshel tint to everi possibl shade of pink and brown and
contempl the roar sea in front of us jut through the foam
and vanish from time to time beneath the rush comber lai the
massiv boiler and other work torn from the hold of some wreck
steamer the sight wa suggest enough but perhap there is no
shore in the world where the sea ha taken a greater toll of live
what scene of terror ha thi beach wit here is on of them
josephu who sai of the harbour that a more danger situat to
ship cannot be imagin relat it of the drown of certain
jew not long befor the fall of jerusalem
at break of dai the wind call by the peopl of the countri the
black north wind aros and caus the most terribl tempest that
had been known the vessel of those who had escap from joppa
by be thrown against the rock or dash against each other
were broken to piec some who by dint of row endeavour to
escap be founder by keep the open sea were toss upon
the mountain billow and then precipit into the profound
abyss of water and a great number of the vessel sunk dure
thi violent content of the element the nois occas by
the dash of the vessel and the lament and outcri of
the miser suffer were terrifi beyond descript mani
of the peopl were wash overboard by the wave and either
drown or dash to piec against the rock other fell upon
their sword and number otherwis perish on board the wreck
the water wa colour with the blood of the deceas whose
carcas were dispers upon the coast dure thi shock scene
the roman soldier wait to destroi those who should be driven on
shore aliv it is comput that the number of bodi driven on
shore wa 4200
truli the merci of ancient war were tender
the anglosaxon merchant saewulf in the year 1102 here wit
anoth disast almost as aw when thei were eight dai out from
cyprusnow it is a night runhi vessel made joppa whereat he wa
fill with an unexpect and extraordinari joi on arriv at the
port some on said to him as he believ by divin inspir
what some on commonli sai to the travel who would disembark at
jaffa sir go on shore todai lest a storm come on in the night
which will render it imposs to land tomorrow
thereupon saewulf sensibl man wa suddenli seiz with a great
desir of land and in fact did land without difficulti and went
to bed next morn on come out of church he found great confus
rage in the place and wa carri along with the crowd to the
shore
when we saw the wave swell higher than mountain and
innumer bodi of drown person of both sex scatter over
the beach while the fragment of ship were float on everi
side noth wa to be heard but the roar of the sea and the
dash togeth of the ship which drown entir the shout
and the clamour of the peopl our own ship which wa a veri
larg and strong on and mani other laden with corn and
merchandis as well as with pilgrim come and return still
held by their anchor but how thei were toss by the wave how
their crew were fill with terror how thei cast overboard their
merchandis what ey of those who were look on could be so
hard and stoni as to refrain from tear we had not look at them
long befor the ship were driven from their anchor by the
violenc of the wave which threw them now up aloft and now
down until thei were run aground or upon the rock and there
thei were beaten backward and forward until thei were crush to
piec for the violenc of the wind would not allow them to put
out to sea and the charact of the coast would not allow them to
put in to shore with safeti of the sailor and pilgrim who had
lost all hope of escap some remain on the ship other laid
hold of the mast or beam of wood mani remain in a state of
stupor and were drown in that condit without ani attempt
to save themselv some although it mai appear incred had
in my sight their head knock off by the veri timber of the
ship to which thei had attach themselv for safeti other
were carri out to sea on the beam instead of be brought to
land even those who knew how to swim had not the strength to
struggl with the wave and veri few thu trust to their own
strength reach the shore aliv thu out of thirti veri larg
ship of which some were what ar commonli call dromund some
gulafr and other cat all laden with palmer and merchandis
scarc seven remain safe when we left the shore of person of
both sex there perish more than a thousand that dai inde
no ey ever beheld a greater misfortun in the space of a singl
dai from all of which god snatch us by hi grace to whom be
honour and glori for ever amen
such ar two of the sea tragedi record of that cruel reef of rock
and the shellstrewn shore on which we sat doubtless it ha seen
other almost as bad inde i have i think read of some in variou
write and mani must have met with no historian but although the
word of josephu that a more danger situat to ship cannot
be imagin ar nearli as true todai as thei were when he wrote
them the turk doe noth to improv the port it ha struck me that
he mai have a reason for thi beyond those which ar customari
throughout the ottoman dominion he mai not wish that it should be
made too conveni for the land either of touristsor of troop
next morn to my intens relief broke calm and fine with a
rapidli fall sea had it been otherwis we must have abandon all
hope of catch the p and o steamer caledonian by which our
passag were book at port said now thi risk seem done with as
we were not to go aboard till the afternoon i attend the sundai

aboard the russian ship by cook boatmen these ar as fine a set of

doubtless at thi danger port thei ar pick with especi care
at ani rate their stalwart appear skill with oar and tiller and
the wild inspir song with which thei drive the larg boat through
the gap in the reef and over the widearch billow suggest
confid even to the fear and for onc made part with

about two oclock we got aboard the cleanlook vessel which wa
engin by an english firm and did not smell half so badli of
pilgrim as i wa warn that she would as she wa not to sail till
five howev i amus myself by sit on the poop and watch the
humour of the deck thei were variou first of all a bag of bean
which wa be ship burst and on those russian sailor wa
impos the psychelik task of collect each wander seed then i
becam awar of a great commot near the funnel and wa inform by
my stalwart friend the captain of cook boatmen who still linger
on board that it wa caus by jew wail a public ceremoni i had

thei had travel from persia or elsewher with a view of be in

to allow them even to disembark there is a turkish law that no jew
mai set foot in the holi land although in fact jew there ar as

thi discrep between rule and fact is of cours baksheesh for
about five pound a head judici distribut ani number of jew
mai proce unmolest to jerusalem and spend the rest of their dai
there these particular unfortun howev had neglect to

witch and warlock at ani rate i cannot often rememb see a
follow of the prophet so visibl upset with a bound he snatch up
hi carpet and rush to the other side of the ship spread it and
began again in the greatest of hurri
now a furiou quarrel which had sprung up between the boatmen who lie
about the steamer side forc our attent two of them rave at

here thi humbl record of a journei which to him who set it down at

human to smile at the misfortun of our fellow the reader mai wish
to learn what befel us at port said
the caviar on board the russian boat wa excel though as there

i rose and went on deck for we were near port said present out of
the grei mist of the morn i saw a majest steamer appear upon our
