note
the world is full of ruin but few of them have an origin so utterli
lost in mysteri as those of zimbabw in south central africa who built
them what purpos did thei serv these ar question that must have
perplex mani gener and mani differ race of men
the research of mr wilmot prove to us inde that in the middl ag
zimbabw or zimbo wa the seat of a barbar empir whose ruler wa
name the emperor of monomotapa also that for some year the jesuit
minist in a christian church built beneath the shadow of it ancient
tower but of the origin purpos of those tower and of the
race that rear them the inhabit of mediv monomotapa it is
probabl knew less even than we know todai the labour and skill
observ of the late mr theodor bent whose death is so great
a loss to all interest in such matter have shown almost beyond
question that zimbabw wa onc an inland phoenician citi or at the
least a citi whose inhabit were of a race which practis phoenician
custom and worship the phoenician deiti beyond thi all is
conjectur how it happen that a trade town protect by vast
fortif and adorn with templ dedic to the worship of the
god of the sidoniansor rather trade town for zimbabw is onli on
of a group of ruinswer built by civilis men in the heart of africa
perhap we shall never learn with certainti though the discoveri of
the buryingplac of their inhabit might throw some light upon the
problem
but if actual proof is lack it is scarc to be doubtedfor the
numer old work in rhodesia tell their own talethat it wa the
presenc of payabl gold reef work by slave labour which tempt the
phoenician merchant and chapmen contrari to their custom to travel
so far from the sea and establish themselv inland perhap the citi
zimbo wa the ophir spoken of in the first book of king at least it
is almost certain that it princip industri were the smelt and
the sale of gold also it seem probabl that expedit travel by
sea and land would have occupi quit three year of time in reach
it from jerusalem and return thither laden with the gold and preciou
stone the ivori and the almug tree 1 king x journei in
africa must have been slow in those dai that it wa also danger is
testifi by the ruin of the ancient fort built to protect the rout
between the gold town and the sea
howev these thing mai be there remain ampl room for specul
both as to the dim begin of the ancient citi and it still dimmer
end whereof we can guess onli when it becam weaken by luxuri and
the mixtur of race that hord of invad savag stamp it out
of exist beneath their bloodstain feet as in after ag thei
stamp out the empir of monomotapa in the follow romant sketch
the writer ha venturedno easi taskto suggest incid such as
might have accompani thi first extinct of the phoenician zimbabw
the pursuit inde is on in which he can onli hope to fill the place
of a humbl pioneer sinc it is certain that in time to come the
dead fortresstempl of south africa will occupi the pen of mani
gener of the writer of romanc who as he hope mai have more
ascertain fact to build upon than ar avail todai

chapter i
the caravan
the sun which shone upon a dai that wa gather to the past some
three thousand year ago wa set in full glori over the expans of
southeastern africath libya of the ancient it last burn rai
fell upon a cavalcad of weari men who togeth with long string of
camel ass and oxen after much toil had struggl to the crest of
a line of stoni hill where thei were halt to recov breath befor
them lai a plain cloth with sere yellow grassfor the season wa
winterand bound by mountain of no great height upon whose slope
stood the citi which thei had travel far to seek it wa the ancient
citi of zimbo whereof the lone ruin ar known to us modern as
zimbabw
at the sight of it flatroof hous of sundri brick set upon the
side of the oppos hill and domin by a huge circular build
of dark stone the caravan rais a great shout of joi it shout in
sever tongu in the tongu of phoenicia of egypt of the hebrew
of arabia and of the coast of africa for all these peopl were
repres amongst it number well might the wander cry out in
their delight see that at length after eight month of peril
travel from the coast thei beheld the wall of their citi of rest
of the golden ophir of the bibl their compani had start from the
eastern port number fifteen hundr men besid women and children
and of those not more than half were left aliv onc a savag tribe

land had taken them so that thei di of it by score twice also had
thei suffer heavili through hunger and thirst to sai noth of their
loss by the fang of lion crocodil and other wild beast which
with the countri swarm now their toil were over and for six month
or perhap a year thei might rest and trade in the great citi enjoi
it wealth it fleshpot and the unholi orgi which among peopl
of the phoenician race were dignifi by the name of the worship of the
god of heaven
soon the clamour di awai and although no command wa given the
caravan start on at speed all weari fade from the face of the
wayworn travel even the veri camel and ass shrunk as most of
them were to mere skeleton seem to understand that labour and blow
were done with and forget their load shambl unurg down the
stoni path on man linger howev clearli he wa a person of rank

go said he i wish to be alon and will follow present so thei
bow to the earth and went
the man wa young perhap six or eight and twenti year of ag hi
dark skin burnt almost to black by the heat of the sun togeth
with the fashion of hi short squarecut beard and of hi garment
proclaim him of jewish or egyptian blood while the gold collar about
hi neck and the gold graven ring upon hi hand show that hi rank
wa high inde thi wander wa none other than the princ aziel

hi face wa oval in shape the featur especi the mouth be
fine and sensit the ey were larg dark and full of thoughtth
ey of a man with a destini for the most part inde thei were
sombr and overful of thought but at time thei could light up with a
strang fire
aziel the princ place hi hand against hi forehead in such fashion as
to shade hi face from the rai of the set sun and from beneath it
shadow gaze long and earnestli at the citi of the hill
at length i behold thee thank be to god he murmur for he wa a
worshipp of jehovah and not of hi mother deiti and it is
time sinc to speak the truth i am weari of thi travel now

devilserv
who can tell said a quiet voic at hi elbow perhap princ you
will find a wife or a throne ora grave
aziel start and turn to see a man stand at hi side cloth in
robe that had been rich but were now torn and stain with travel
and wear on hi head a black cap in shape not unlik the fez that
is common in the east todai the man wa past middl ag have a
grizzl beard sharp hard featur and quick ey which withal were
not unkindli he wa a phoenician merchant much trust by hiram
the king of tyre who had made him captain of the merchandis of thi

that i have a spirit when i die i die and there is an end but the
bless of heaven ah that can be bought as i have prove onc and
again if not with gold then otherwis did i not in bygon year pass
the first son of my manhood through the fire to baalsidon nai shrink

that the boi should die than that all of us should live on in penuri and
bond know you not princ that the god must have the gift of the
best gift of blood and virtu or thei will curs us and torment us
i do not know it metem for such god ar no god but devil
children of beelzebub who ha no power over the righteou truli i
would have none of your two god phoenician upon earth the god of gold
and in heaven the devil of slaughter

to prove hi power on you for the rest i had sooner follow after gold
than the folli of a drunken spirit which you name love see that it
work it votari less mischief sai now it wa a woman and her love
that drove you hither to thi wild land wa it not princ well be
care lest a woman and her love should keep you here
the sun set said aziel coldli let us go forward
with a bow and a murmur salut for hi quick courtier instinct told
him that he had spoken too freeli metem took the bridl of the princ
mule hold the stirrup while he mount then he turn to seek hi
own but the anim had wander and a full half hour went by befor it
could be captur
by now the sun had set and as there is littl or no twilight in
southern africa it becam difficult for the two travel to find their
wai down the rough hill path still thei stumbl on till present
the long dead grass brush against their knee told them that thei
had lost the road although thei knew that thei were ride in the right
direct for the watchfir burn on the citi wall were a guid
to them soon howev thei lost sight of these fire the bough of
a grove of thicklyleav tree hide them from view and in try to
push their wai through the wood metem mule stumbl against a root and
fell
now there is but on thing to be done said the phoenician as he
drag the anim from the ground and it is to stai here till the
moon rise which should be within an hour it would have been wiser
princ if we had wait to discuss love and the god till we were safe
within the wall of the citi for the end of it is that we have fallen
into the hand of king dark and he is the father of mani evil
thing
that is so metem answer the princ and i am to blame let us
bide here in patienc sinc we must
so hold their mule by the bridl thei sat down upon the ground
and wait in silenc for each of them wa lost in hi own thought
chapter ii
the grove of baalti
at length as the two men sat thu silent for the place and it
gloom oppress them a sound broke upon the quiet of the night that
begin with a low wail such as might come from the lip of a mourner
end in a chant or song the voic which seem close at hand wa
low rich and passion at time it sank almost to a sob and at
time take a higher note it thrill upon the air in tone that
would have been shrill were thei not so sweet
who is it that sing said aziel to metem
be silent i prai you whisper the other in hi ear we have
wander into on of the sacr grove of baalti which it is death
for men to enter save at the appoint festiv and a priestess of the
grove chant her prayer to the goddess
we did not come of our own will so doubtless we shall be forgiven
answer aziel indiffer but that song move me tell me the word
of it which i can scarc follow for her accent is strang to me
princ thei seem to be holi word to which i have littl right to
hearken the priestess sing an ancient hallow chant of life and
death and she prai that the goddess mai touch her soul with the wing
of fire and make her great and give her vision of thing that have been
and that shall be more i dare not tell you now inde i can bare
hear and the song is hard to understand crouch down for the moon
rise and prai that the mule mai not stir present she will go and
we can fly the holi place
the israelit obei and wait search the dark with eager ey
now the edg of the great moon appear upon the horizon and by degre
her white rai of light reveal a strang scene to the watcher about
an open space of ground some eighti pace in diamet grew seven huge
and ancient baobab tree so ancient inde that thei must have been
plant by the primval hand of natur rather than by that of man aziel
and hi companion were hidden with their mule behind the trunk of on
of these tree and look round it thei perceiv that the open space
beyond the shadow of the branch wa not empti in the centr of thi
space stood an altar and by it wa place the rude figur of a divin
carv in wood and paint on the head of thi figur rose a crescent
symbol of the moon and round it neck hung a chain of wooden star
it had four wing but no hand and of these wing two were outspread
and two clasp a shapeless object to it breast intend appar
to repres a child by these symbol aziel knew that befor him wa
an effigi sacr to the goddess of the phoenician who in differ
countri pass by the variou name of astart or ashtoreth or
baalti and who in their coars worship wa at onc the personif
of the moon and the emblem of fertil
stand befor thi rude fetish between it and the altar whereon lai
some flower and in such fashion that the moonlight struck full upon
her wa a whiterob woman she wa young and veri beauti both in
shape and featur and though her black hair stream almost to the
knee took from her height she still seem tall her round arm were
outstretch her sweet and passion face wa upturn toward the
sky and even at that distanc the watcher could see her deep ey
shine in the moonlight the sacr song of the priestess wa finish
now she wa prai aloud slowli and in a clear voic so that aziel
could hear and understand her prai from her veri heart not to the
idol befor her howev but to the moon abov
o queen of heaven she said thou whose throne i see but whose face
i cannot see hear the prayer of thy priestess and protect me from the
fate i fear and rid me of him i hate safe let me dwell and pure and
as thou fillest the night with light so fill the dark of my soul
with the wisdom that i crave o whisper into my ear and let me hear the
voic of heaven teach me that which i would know read me the riddl
of my life and let me learn wherefor i am not as my sister ar why
feast and offer delight me not why i thirst for knowledg and not
for wealth and why i crave such love as here i cannot win satisfi my
be with thy immort lore and a love that doe not fail or die and
if thou wilt then take my life in payment speak to me from the heaven
abov o baalti or show me some sign upon the earth beneath fill up
the vessel of my thirsti soul and satisfi the hunger of my spirit oh
thou that art the goddess thou that hast the gift of power give me
thy servant of thy power of thy godhead and of thy peac hear me
o heavenborn hear me elissa the daughter of sakon the dedic
of thee hear hear and answer now in the secret holi hour answer by
voic by wonder or by symbol
the woman paus as though exhaust with the passion of her prayer
hide her face in her hand and as she stood thu silent and
expect the sign came or at least that chanc which for a while she
believ to have been an answer to her invoc her face wa hidden
so she could not see and fascin by her beauti as it appear to
them in that unhallow spot and by the depth and digniti of her wild
prayer the two watcher had ey for her alon therefor it happen
that not until hi arm wa about to drag her awai did either of them
perceiv a huge man black as eboni in colour clad in a cloak of
leopard skin and carri in hi right hand a broadblad spear who
follow the shadow of the tree had crept upon the priestess from the
farther side of the glade
with a guttur exclam of triumph he grip her in hi left arm
and despit her struggl and her shrill cry for help began half to
drag and half to carri her toward the deep shade of the baobab grove
instantli aziel and metem sprang up and rush forward draw their
bronz sword as thei ran as it chanc howev the israelit caught
hi foot in on of the numer treeroot which stood abov the
surfac of the ground and fell heavili upon hi face in a few second
twenti perhap he found hi breath and feet again to see that metem
had come up with the black giant who hear hi approach suddenli
wheel round to meet him still hold the struggl priestess in
hi grasp now the phoenician wa so close upon him that the savag could
find no time to shift the grip upon hi spear but drove at him with
the knob end of it handl strike him full upon the forehead and
fell him as a butcher fell an ox then onc more he turn to fly
with hi captiv but befor he had cover ten yard the sound of
aziel approach footstep caus him to wheel round again
at sight of the israelit advanc upon him with drawn sword the great
barbarian freed himself from the burden of the girl by throw her
heavili to the ground where she lai for the breath wa shaken out of
her then snatch the cloak from hi throat he wound it over hi left
arm to serv as a shield and with a savag yell rush straight at
aziel purpos to transfix him with the broadhead spear
well wa it for the princ that he had been train in swordplai from
hi youth also notwithstand hi slight build that he wa strong
and activ as a leopard to await the onslaught would be to die for
the spear must pierc him befor ever he could reach the attack bodi
with hi short sword therefor as the weapon flash upward he sprang
asid avoid it at the same time with on swift sweep of hi sword
slash it holder across the back as he pass him
with a howl of pain and rage the savag sprang round and charg him a
second time again aziel leapt to on side but now he struck with all
hi forc at the spear shaft which hi assail lift to guard hi
head so strong wa the blow and so sharp the heavi sword that it shore
through the wood sever the handl from the spear which fell to the
ground cast awai the useless shaft the warrior drew a long knife
from hi girdl and befor aziel could strike again face him for
the third time but he no longer rush onward like a bull for he had
learnt caution he stood still hold the skin cloak befor him shield
fashion and peer at hi adversari from over it edg
now it wa aziel turn to take the offens and slowli he circl
round the huge barbarian watch hi opportun at length it came
in answer to a feint of hi the protect cloak wa drop a littl
enabl him to prick it bearer in the neck but onli with the point
of hi sword the thrust deliv he leapt back and not too soon for
forget hi caution in hi furi the savag charg straight at him
with a roar like that of a lion so swift and terribl wa hi onset
that aziel have no time to spring asid did the onli thing possibl
grip the ground with hi feet he bent hi bodi forward and with
outstretch arm and sword brace up hi muscl to receiv the charg
anoth instant and the leopard skin cloak flutter befor him with
a quick movement of hi left arm he swept it asid then there came a
sudden pressur upon hi sword end in a jar shock a flash of
steel abov hi head and down he went to the ground beneath the weight
of the black giant
now there is an end he thought heaven receiv my spirit and hi
sens left him
when thei return again aziel perceiv dimli that a whitedrap
figur bent over him drag at someth black which crush hi
breast who as she drag sob in her grief and fear then he
rememb and with an effort sat up roll from him the corps of
hi foe for hi sword had pierc the barbarian through breast and

i heard you name yourself ladi in the prayer you made befor the
altar
you heard my prayer princ she said start do you not know that
it is death to that man who hearken to the prayer of a priestess
of baalti utter in her holi grove still none know it save the
goddess who see all therefor i beseech you for your own sake and the
sake of your companion sai noth of it in the citi lest it should
come to the ear of the priest of el
certainli it would have been death to you had i not chanc to hear

well sinc i did hear it i will add that it wa a beauti prayer
reveal a heart high and pure though i griev that it should have
been offer to on whom i hold to be a demon

though you be a hebrew worship him thei call jehovah or so i have
been told i be of the blood of the sidonian worship the ladi
baalti the queen of heaven the holi on of whom i am a priestess
so it is ala he said with a sigh ad
well let us not disput of these matter though if you wish the
prophet issachar the levit who accompani me can explain the truth
of them to you
elissa made no repli and for a while thei walk on in silenc
who wa that black robber whom i slew aziel ask present
i am not sure princ she answer hesit but savag such as
he haunt the outskirt of the citi seek to steal white women to be
their wive doubtless he watch my step follow me into the holi
place
why then did you ventur there alon ladi
becaus to be heard such prayer as mine must be offer in solitud
in the consecr grove and at the hour of the rise of the moon
moreov cannot baalti protect her priestess priest and did she not
protect her
i thought ladi that i had someth to do with the matter he
answer
ay princ it wa your hand that struck the blow which kill the
thief but baalti and no other led you to the place to rescu me
i understand ladi to save you baalti lai asid her own power
led a mortal man to the grove which it is death that mortal man should
violat
who can fathom the wai of the god she repli with passion then
ad as though reason with a newborn doubt did not the goddess
hear my prayer and answer it
in truth ladi i cannot sai let me think if i understood you
rightli you prai for heavenli wisdom but whether or not you have
gain it within thi last hour i do not know and then you prai for
love an immort love o maiden ha it come to you sinc yonder moon
appear upon the sky and you prai
peac she broke in peac and mock me not or princ that you ar
i will publish your crime of spy upon the prayer of a priestess
of baalti i tell you that i prai for a symbol and a sign and the
prayer wa answer
did not the black giant spring upon me to bear me awai to be hi
slavehi or anoth and is he not a symbol of the evil and the
ignor which ar on the earth and that seek to drag down the beauti
and the wisdom of the earth to their own level then the phoenician
ran to rescu me and wa defeat sinc the spirit of mammon cannot
overcom the black power of ill next you came and fought hard and
long till in the end you slew the mighti foe you a princ born of the
royal blood of the world and she ceas
you have a pretti gift of parabl ladi as it should be with on who
interpret the oracl of a goddess but you have not told me of what i
your servant am the symbol
she stop in her walk and look him full in the face
i never heard she said that either the jew or the egyptian be
instruct were blind to the read of an allegori but princ if
you cannot read thi on it is not for me who am but a woman to set it
out to you
just then their glanc met and in the clear moonlight aziel saw a wave
of doubt sweep over hi companion dark and beauti ey and a faint
flush appear upon her brow he saw and someth stir at hi heart
that till thi hour he had never felt someth which even now he knew
it would troubl him greatli to escap
tell me ladi he ask hi voic sink almost to a whisper in
thi fabl of your am i even for an hour deem worthi to plai the part
of that immort love embodi which you sought so earnestli a while
ago
immort love princ she answer in a new voic a voic low and
deep is not for on hour but for all hour that ar and ar to be
you and you alon can know if you would dare to plai such a part as
thiseven in a fabl
perchanc ladi there live a woman for whom it might be dare
princ no such woman live sinc immort love must deal not with
the flesh but with the spirit if a spirit worthi to be thu love
and worship now wander in earthli shape upon the world seek
it counterpart and it complet i cannot tell yet were it so and
should thei chanc to meet it might be happi for such brave spirit
for then the answer to the great riddl would be their
wonder what thi riddl might be aziel bent toward her to repli
when suddenli round a bend in the path but a few pace from them came

surround territori
on of these stranger immedi attract the attent of aziel who
wa seat in the place of honour at the right of sakon between him and
the ladi elissa thi man wa of larg statur and about forti year of

rough diamond which hung about hi neck show him to be a person
of import hi tawni complexion mark him of mix race thi
conclus hi featur did not beli for the brow nose and
cheekbon were semit in outlin while the full promin ey
and thick sensuou lip could with equal certainti be attribut to
the negroid stock in fact he wa the son of a nativ african queen or
chieftai and a nobl phoenician and hi rank no less than that of
absolut king and hereditari chief of a vast and undefin territori
which lai around the trade citi of the white men whereof zimbo
wa the head and largest aziel notic that thi king who wa name
ithob seem angri and ill at eas whether becaus he wa not
satisfi with the place which had been allot to him at the tabl or
for other reason he could not at the time determin
when the meat had been remov and the goblet were fill with wine
men began to talk till present sakon call for silenc and rise
address aziel
princ he said in the name of thi great and free cityfor free it
is though we acknowledg the king of tyre as our suzeraini give you
welcom within our gate here far in the heart of libya we have
heard of the gloriou and wise king your grandfath and of the mighti
pharaoh of egypt whose blood run also within your vein princ we

gold can boast is your long mai you live mai the favour of those god

and of love mai the good grain of all be garner in your bosom and
the wind of prosper winnow out the chaff of them to fall beneath your
feet princ i have greet you as it behov me to greet the blood
of solomon and pharaoh now i add a word now i greet you as a father
greet the man who ha save hi onli and belov daughter from death
or shame bondag know you friend what thi stranger did sinc
tonight moonris my daughter wa at worship alon yonder without
the wall and a great savag set on her purpos to bear her awai
captiv ay and he would have done it had not the princ aziel here
given him battl and after a fierc fight slain him
no great deed to kill a singl savag broke in the king ithob who
had been listen with impati to sakon prais of thi highborn
stranger
no great deed you sai king answer sakon guard be in the
bodi of the man and set it befor us
there wa a paus till present six men stagger up the hall bear
between them the corps of the barbarian which still cover with the
leopard skin mantl thei threw down on the edg of the da
see said on of the bearer withdraw the cloak from the huge
bodi then point to the sword which still transfix it he ad
and learn what strength heaven give to the arm of princ
such as the guest as were near enough rose to look at the grizzli
sight then turn to offer their congratul to the conqueror but
there wa on of themth king ithobalwho offer none inde as
hi ey fell upon the face of the corps thei grew alight with rage
what ail you king ar you jealou of such a blow ask sakon
watch him curious
speak no more of that thrust i prai you said aziel for it wa due
to the weight of the man rush on the sword which after he wa dead i
could not find the power to loosen from hi breastbon
then i will do you that servic princ sneer ithob and set
hi foot upon the breast of the corps with a sudden effort of hi
great frame he pluck out the sword and cast it down upon the tabl
now on might think said aziel flush with anger that you
king who do a courtesi to a man of smaller strength mean a challeng
doubtless howev i am mistaken who do not understand the manner of
thi countri
think what you will princ answer the chieftain but learn that
he who li dead befor us by your handa you saywa no slave to be
kill at pleasur but a man of rank none other inde than the son
of my mother sister
is it so repli aziel then sure king you ar well rid of a
cousin howev highli born who made it hi busi to ravish maiden
from their home
by wai of answer to these word ithob sprang from hi seat again
lai hand upon hi sword but befor he could speak or draw it the
governor sakon address him in a cold and mean voic
of your courtesi king he said rememb that the princ here is my
guest as you ar and give us peac if that dead man wa your cousin
at least he well deserv to die not at the hand of on of royal blood
but by that of the execution for he wa the worst of thievesa thief
of women now tell me king i prai you how came your cousin here so
far from home sinc he wa not number in your retinu
i do not know sakon answer ithob and if i knew i would not
sai you tell me that my dead kinsman wa a thief of women which in
phoenician ey must be a crime inde so be it but thief or no thief
i sai that there is a blood feud between me and the man who slew him
and were he great solomon himself instead of on of fifti princelet of
hi line he should pai bitterli for the dead tomorrow sakon i will
meet you befor i leav for my own land for i have word to speak
to you till then farewelland rise he strode down the hall
follow by hi offic and guard
the sudden departur of king ithob in anger wa the signal for the
break up of the feast
why is that halfbr chief so wrath with me ask aziel in a low
voic of elissa as thei follow sakon to anoth chamber
becauseif you would know the truthh set hi dead cousin to kidnap
me and you thwart him she answer look straight befor her
aziel made no repli for at that moment sakon turn to speak with him
and hi face wa anxiou
i crave your pardon princ he said draw him asid that you
should have met with such insult at my board had it been ani other man
who spoke thu to you by now he had ru hi word but thi ithob
is the terror of our citi for if he choos he can bring a hundr
thousand savag upon us shut us within our wall to starv
and cut us off from the work of the mine whenc we win gold
therefor in thi wai or that he must be humour as inde we have
humour him and hi father for year though now he ad hi brow
darken he demand a price that i am loth to pai and he glanc
toward hi daughter who stood watch them at a littl distanc
look most beauti in her white robe and ornament of gold
can you not make war upon him and break hi power ask aziel with
a strang anxieti guess that thi price demand by ithob wa none
other than elissa the woman whom he had rescu and whose wisdom and
beauti had stir hi heart
it might be done princ but the risk would be great and we ar here
to work the mine and grow rich in tradenot to make war the polici of
zimbo ha alwai been a polici of peac
i have a better and cheaper plan said a calm voic at hi elbowthat
of metem it is thi slip a bowstr over the brute head as he
li snore and pull it tight an eagl in a cage is easi to deal
with but onc on the wing the matter is differ
there is wisdom in your counsel said sakon in a hesit voic
wisdom broke in aziel ay the wisdom of the assassin what nobl
sakon would you murder a sleep guest
no princ i would not he answer hastili also such a deed would
bring the tribe upon us
then sakon you ar more foolish than you us to be said metem
laugh a man who will not despatch a foe whenev he can catch him
by mean fair or foul is not the man to govern a rich citi set in the
heart of a barbar land and so i shall tell hiram our king if ever
i live to see tyre again as for you most high princ forgiv the
humblest of your servant if he tell you that the tender of your
heart and the nobil of your sentiment will i think bring you to
an earli and evil end and glanc toward elissa as though to put a
point upon hi word metem smile sarcast and withdrew
at thi moment a messeng whose long white hair wild ey and red
robe announc him to be a priest of el by which name the peopl of
zimbo worship baal enter the room and whisper someth into
the ear of sakon which seem to disturb him much
pardon me princ and you my guest if i leav you said the
governor but i have evil tide that call me to the templ the ladi
baalti is seiz with the black fever and i must visit her for an
hour farewel
thi new caus constern among the compani and in the gener
confus that follow it announc aziel join elissa who had
pass on to the balconi of the hous and wa seat there alon
look out over the moonlit citi and the plain beyond at hi approach
she rose in token of respect then sat herself down again motion him
to do likewis
give me of your wisdom ladi he said i thought that baalti wa the
goddess whom i heard you worship yonder in the grove how then can
she be stricken with a fever
she is the goddess elissa answer smile but the ladi baalti
is a woman whom we rever as the incarn of that goddess upon earth
and be but a woman in her hour she must die
then what becom of the incarn of the goddess
anoth is chosen by the colleg of the priest of el and the compani
of the priestess of baalti if that ladi baalti who is dead chanc
to leav a daughter it is usual for the lot to fall upon her if not
upon such on of the nobl maiden as mai be chosen
doe the ladi baalti marri then
ye princ within a year of her consecr she must choos herself
a husband and he mai be whom she will provid onli that he is of
white blood and doe public sacrific to el and baalti then after she
ha name him thi husband take the titl of shadid and for so long
as hi wife shall live he is the high priest of the god el and cloth
with the majesti of the god as hi wife is cloth with the majesti of
baalti but should she die anoth win hi place
it is a strang faith said aziel which teach that the lord of
heaven can find a home in mortal breast but ladi it is your so of
it i sai no more now tell me if you will what did you mean when you
said that thi barbarian king ithob set the savag whom i slew to
kidnap you do you know thi or do you suspect it onli
i suspect it from the first princ and for good reason moreov
i read it in the king face as he look upon the corps and when he
perceiv me among the feaster
and why should he wish to carri you awai thi brutal ladi when he
is at peac with the great citi
perchanc princ after what pass tonight you can guess she
answer lower her ey
ye ladi i can guess and though it is shame that such an on
should dare to think of you still sinc he is a man i cannot blame
him overmuch but why should he press hi suit in thi rough and secret
fashion instead of openli as a king might do
he mai have press it openli and been repuls she repli in a low
voic but if he could have carri me to some far fortress how should
i flout him there that is if i still live there with no price
to pai in gold or land or power he would have been my master and i
should have been hi slave till such time as he weari of me that is
the fate from which you have save me princ or rather from death for
i am not on who could bear such shame at the hand of a man i hate
ladi he said bow i think that perhap for the first time in my
life i am glad tonight that i wa born
and i she answer who am but a phoenician maiden am glad that i
should have live to hear on who is as royal in thought and soul as he
is in rank speak thu to me oh princ she ad clasp her hand
if your word ar not those of empti courtesi alon hear me for you
ar great a lord of the earth whom none refus and it mai be in your
power to give me aid princ i am in a sore strait for that danger
from which i prai to be deliv thi night press me hard princ
it is true that ithob ha been refus my hand both by myself and by
my father and therefor it wa that he strove to steal me awai but the
evil is not done with for the great nobl of the citi and the chief
priest of el came to my father at sunset and prai him that he would
let ithob take me see that otherwis in hi rage he will make war
upon zimbo when a man place as is my father must choos between the
safeti of thousand and the honour and happi of on poor girl what
will hi answer be think you
now said aziel save that no wrong can right a wrong i almost
griev that i cri shame upon the counsel of metem sweet ladi be sure
of thi that i will give all i have even to my life to protect you
from the vile fate you dready all i haveexcept my soul
ah she cri with a sudden flash of her dark ey all except your
soul if we women could find the man who would risk both life and soul
for us then were he but a slave we would worship him as never man wa
worship sinc baalti mount her heavenli throne
were i not a hebrew you would tempt me ladi aziel answer smile
but be on i mai not risk my soul even were such a prize within my
reach
nai princ she broke in i did but jest forget my word for thei
were wrung from a heart torn with fear oh did you know the terror of
thi halfsavag ithob which oppress me you would forgiv me alla
terror that tonight li upon me with a tenfold weight
why so ladi
doubtless becaus it is nearer elissa whisper but her beauti
plead ey and quiver lip seem to beli her word and sai
becaus you ar near and a chang ha come upon me
for the second time that dai aziel glanc met her and for the
second time a strang new pang that wa more pain than joi and yet
halfdivin snatch at hi heartstr for a while numb hi
reason and take from him the power of speech
what wa it he wonder vagu he had seen mani love face and
mani nobl women had shown him favour but why had none of them
stir him thu could it be that thi stranger gentil maiden wa hi
soulmatesh whom he wa destin to love abov all upon the earth
nai whom he did alreadi love and so soon
ladi he said take a step toward her ladi and he paus
elissa bow her dark head till her goldbedeck and scent hair
almost fell upon hi feet but she made no answer
then anoth voic broke upon the silenc a clear strident voic that
said
princ forgiv me if for the second time todai i disturb you but
the guest have gone your chamber is made readi and not know the
custom of the women of thi countri i sought you littl guess
that at such an hour i should find you alon with on of them
aziel look up although there wa no need for him to do so for
he knew that voic well to see the tall form of the levit issachar
stand befor them a cold light of anger shine in hi ey
elissa saw also and with some murmur word of farewel she turn
and went leav them togeth
chapter iv
the dream of issachar
for a moment there wa silenc which aziel broke sai
it seem to me issachar that you ar somewhat over zealou for my
welfar
i think otherwis princ repli the levit sternli did not your
grandsir give you into my keep and shall i not be faith to my
trust and to a higher duti than ani which he could lai upon me
your mean issachar
it is plain princ but i will set it out the great king said to me
yonder in the hall of hi golden palac at jerusalem to other men of
war i have given charg of the bodi of my grandson to keep him safe to
you issachar the levit who have foster him i give charg over
hi soul to keep it safea higher task and more difficult guard him
issachar from the temptat of strang doctrin and the whisper
of strang god but guard him most of all from the wile of strang
women who bow the knee to baal for such ar the gate of gehenna upon
earth and those who enter by it shall find their place in tophet
truli my grandsir speak wise on thi matter as on all other
answer aziel but still i do not understand
then i will be more clear princ how come it that i find you
alon with thi beauti sorceress thi worshipp of the shedevil
baalti with whom you should scorn even to speak except such word as
courtesi demand
is it then forbidden to me ask aziel angrili to talk with the
daughter of my host a ladi whom i chanc to save from death of the
custom of her countri and the mysteri of worship
the mysteri of worship answer issachar scornfulli ay the
mysteri of the worship of that fair bodi of her that ivori chalic
fill with foulnesswhereof if a man drink hi faith shall be rot
and hi soul poison the mysteri of that worship wa it princ
that caus you but now to lean toward thi woman as though to embrac
her with word of love burn in your heart if not between your lip
ah these witch of baalti know their trade well thei ar full of
evil gift and of the wisdom given to them by the fiend thei serv
with touch and sigh and look thei can stir the blood of youth have
much practic in the art till it seeth within the vein and drown
conscienc in it flood
nai princ hear the truth continu issachar till moonris you
had never seen thi woman and now your quick blood is aflam and you
love her deni it if you candeni it on your honour and i will believ
you for you ar no liar
aziel thought for a moment and answer
issachar you have no right to question me on thi matter yet sinc
you have adjur me by my honour i will be open with you i do not know
if i love thi woman who as you sai is a stranger to me but it
is true that my heart turn toward her like flower to the sun till
todai i had never seen her yet when my ey first fell upon her face
yonder in that accurs grove it seem to me that i had been born onli
that i might find her it seem to me even that for ag i had known
her that for ever she wa mine and that i wa her read me the riddl
issachar is thi but passion born of youth and the sudden sight of a
fair woman that cannot be for i have known other as fair and have
pass through some such fire tell me issachar you who ar old and
wise and have seen much of the heart of men what is thi wave that
overwhelm me
what is it princ it is witcheri it is the wile of beelzebub wait
to snatch your soul and if you hearken to it you shall pass through
the firethrough the fire to moloch if not in the flesh then in the
spirit which is to all etern oh not in vain do i fear for you my
son and not without reason wa i warn in a dream listen last night
as i lai in my tent yonder upon the plain i dream that some danger
overshadow you and in my sleep i prai that your destini might be
reveal to me as i prai thu i heard a voic sai issachar you
seek to learn the futur know then that he who is dear to you shall be
tri in the furnac inde ye becaus of hi great love and piti
he shall forswear hi faith and with death and sorrow he shall pai the
price of hi sin
then i wa troubl and besought heaven that you my son might be
save from thi unknown temptat but the voic answer me
of their own will onli can thei who were on from the begin be
held apart through good and ill let them work each other woe or weal
the goal is sure but thei must choos the road
now as i wonder what these dark sai might mean the gloom open
and i saw you aziel stand in a grove of tree while toward you
with outstretch hand drew a veil woman who bore upon her brow the
golden bow of baalti then fire rage about you and in the fire i
beheld mani thing which i have forgotten and move through it wa the
princ of death who slew and slew and spare not so i awok heavi at
heart know that there had fallen on me who love you a shadow of doom
to come
in these latter dai ani educ man would set asid issachar wild
vision as the vapour of a mind distraught but aziel live in the
time of solomon when men of hi nation guid their step by the light
of propheci and believ that it wa the divin pleasur by mean of
dream and wonder and through the mouth of chosen seer to declar
the will of jehovah upon earth to thi faith inde we still hold
fast at least so far as that period and peopl ar concern see
that we acknowledg isaiah david and their compani to have been
inspir from abov of that compani issachar the levit wa on for to
him from hi youth up voic had spoken in the watch of the night
and often he had pour hi warn and denunci into the ear
of king and peopl tell them with no uncertain voic of the
consequ of sin and idolatri and of punish to come thi aziel
who had been hi ward and pupil knew well and therefor he did not
mock at the priest dream or set it asid as naught but bow hi head
and listen
i am honour inde he said with humil that the destini of my
poor soul and bodi should be a thing of weight to those on high
of your poor soul aziel broke in issachar that soul of your of
which you speak so lightli is of as great valu in the ey of heaven
as that of ani cherubim within it gate the angel who fell were the
first and chiefest of the angel and though now we ar clad with mortal
shape in punish of our sin again redeem and glorifi we can
becom among the mightiest of their host oh my son i beseech you
turn from thi woman while there yet is time lest to you her lip
should be a cup of woe and your soul shall pai the price of them
share the hell of the worshipp of ashtoreth
it mai be so said aziel but issachar what said the voic
that thi the woman of your dream and i were on from the begin
issachar you believ that the ladi elissa is she of whom the voic
spoke in your sleep and you bid me turn from her becaus she will bring
me sin and punish in truth if i can i will obei you sinc rather
than forswear my faith as your dream foretold i would die a hundr
death nor do i believ that for ani bribe of woman love i shall
forswear it in act or thought yet if such thing come about it is fate
that drive me on not my willand what man can flee hi fate but even
though thi ladi be she whom i am doom to love you sai that becaus
she is heathen i must reject her shame upon the thought for if she is
heathen it is through ignor and it mai be mine to chang her heart
becaus i stand in danger shall i suffer her who as you tell me wa
on with me from the begin to be lost in that hell of baal of which
you speak nai your dream is fals i will not renounc my faith but
rather will win her to share it and togeth we shall triumph and that
i swear to you issachar
truli the evil on ha mani wile answer the levit and i did
ill to tell you of my dream see that it can be twist to serv the
purpos of your mad have your will aziel and reap the fruit of
it but of thi i warn youthat while i can find a wai to thwart it
never princ shall you take that witch to your bosom to be the ruin of
your life and soul
then issachar on thi matter there mai be war between us
ay there is war said the levit and left him
the sun wa alreadi high in the heaven when aziel awok from the deep
and dreamless sleep which follow on the excit and exhaust of

an abomin creed nai for aught he knew she wa herself defil
with it abomin and her wisdom but an evil gift from the evil
power she serv could he a princ of the royal blood of the hous of
israel and of the ancient pharaoh of khem desir to have anyth to
do with such an on he a child of the chosen peopl a worshipp of
the true and onli god yesterdai she had thrown a spell upon him a
spell of black magic or the spell of her imperi beauti which it
matter not but todai he wa the lord of hi own mind and would
shake himself free of it and her
in the marketplac below the levit issachar also had watch the
pass of the priest and priestess of el and baalti
tell me metem he ask of the phoenician who stood besid him hi
head respectfulli uncov what mummeri is thi
it is no mummeri worthi issachar but a ceremoni of public sacrific
which is to be offer in the templ yonder for the recoveri from her
sick of the ladi baalti the highpriestess
where then is the offer i see none unless it be those dove that
ar ti to the wrist of the women
nai issachar answer metem smile darkli the god ask nobler
blood than that of dove the offer is within and it is the
firstborn child of a priestess of baalti
o lord of heaven said issachar lift up hi ey how long will
you suffer that thi murder and accurs race should defil the face
of earth
softli friend broke in metem i have read your scriptur and is
it not set out in them that your great forefath wa command to offer
up hi firstborn in such a sacrific
blasphem not answer the jew he wa command inde that
hi heart might be prove but hi hand wa stai he whom i worship
delight not in the blood of children

whiterob priestess watch her he note her glanc at the window
of aziel chamber and saw what she could not see that the princ wa
seat there thi daughter of satan spread her net he mutter
between hi teeth then a thought struck him and he ad aloud sai
metem is it permit to stranger to wit the rite in yonder
templ
sure answer the phoenician that is if thei guard their tongu
and do noth to offend
then i desir to see them metem and so doubtless doe the princ
aziel therefor if it is your will do me the servic to enter hi
chamber in the palac where he is sit and bid him to a great

guard on duti who drew back to let them pass in singl file for the

between huge wall built of granit block laid without mortar till at
length thei reach a larg open space here the ceremoni had alreadi
begun almost in the centr of thi space which wa pave with block

thu far the priest and the spectat had listen to issachar
denunci in bewild amaz not unmix with fear now with a
roar of wrath thei awok and suddenli he wa drag from the platform
by a score of hand and struck down with mani blow inde he would
then and there have been torn to piec had not a guard of soldier
know that he wa sakon guest and in the train of the princ aziel
snatch him from the madden multitud and born him swiftli to a
place of safeti without the enclosur
while the tumult wa at it height a phoenician who had arriv in the
templ breathless with hast might have been seen to pluck metem by the
sleev
what is it metem ask of the man who wa hi servant

that i should speak thu of a holi man but he ha put all our live in
danger
i do not pardon you answer aziel hotli and i honour issachar for
hi act and word let us begon from thi accurs place whither you

befor metem could repli a voic cri close the door of the
sanctuari so that none can pass in or go out and let the sacrific be
offer
listen princ said metem you must stai here till the ceremoni is
done
then i tell you phoenician answer aziel that rather than suffer
that luckless child to be butcher befor my ey i will cut my wai to

to leav yourself dead in place of it answer metem sarcast
but see a woman desir to speak with you and he point to a girl
in the robe of a priestess whose face wa hidden with a veil and who
in the tumult and confus had work her wai to aziel

metem who had overheard someth of thi talk whisper in her ear
daughter of sakon what will you give me if i show you a wai to save

the vengeanc of baalti yet it shall be dare fear not your pai is
good and she press forward to her place keep the veil wrap
about her head till she reach it unobserv for in the gener
confus none had notic her movement
when the nois of shout and angri voic had at length di awai and
the spectat were driven back outsid the sacr circl the priest
upon the platform cri
now that the jew blasphem ha gone let the sacrific be offer as
is decre
yea let the sacrific be offer answer the multitud and onc
more the woman with the sleep child step forward but befor the
priest could take it anoth figur approach him that of elissa with
arm outstretch and ey upturn
hold o priest she said for the goddess breath on my brow
inspir me and i have a messag from the goddess
draw near daughter and speak it in the ear of men the priest
answer wonder for he found it hard to believ in such inspir
and inde would have deni her a hear had he dare
so elissa climb the platform and stand upon it still with
outstretch hand and upturn face she said in a clear voic
the goddess refus the sacrific sinc she ha taken to herself her
for whom it wa to have been offeredth ladi baalti is dead
at thi tide a groan went up from the peopl partli of grief for
the loss of a spiritu dignitari who wa popular and partli of
disappoint becaus now the sacrific could not be offer for the
phoenician love these horribl spectacl which were not howev
commonli celebr by daylight and in the presenc of the peopl
it is a lie cri a voic but now the ladi baalti wa live
let the gate be open and send to see whether or no i lie said
elissa quietli
then for a while there wa silenc while a priest went upon the errand
at length he wa seen return push hi wai through the crowd he
mount the platform and said
the daughter of sakon speak truth ala the ladi baalti is dead
elissa sigh in relief for had her tide prove fals she could
scarc have hope to escap the furi of the crowd
ay she cri she is dead as i told you and becaus of your sin
who would have offer human sacrific in public against the custom of
our faith and citi and without the command of the goddess
then in sullen silenc the priest and priestess reform their
rank and depart from the sanctuari whenc thei were follow by the
spectat the most of them in no good mood for thei had been baulk
of the promis spectacl
chapter vi
the hall of audienc
when elissa reach her chamber after the break up of the process
she threw herself upon her couch and burst into a passion of tear
well might she weep for she had been fals to her oath as a priestess
utter as a messag from the goddess that which she had learnt from
the lip of man more she could not rid herself of the remembr of
the scorn and loath with which the princ aziel had look upon her
or of the bitter insult of hi word when he call her a girl of the
grove and a murderess of children
it chanc that so far as elissa wa concern these charg were
utterli untru none could throw a slur upon her and as for these rare
human sacrific she loath the veri name of them nor unless
forc to it would she have been present had she guess that ani such
offer wa intend
like most of the ancient religion that of the phoenician had two side
to ita spiritu and a materi side the spiritu side wa a
worship of the faroff unknown divin symbolis by the sun moon and
planet and visibl onli in their majest movement and in the forc
of natur to thi elissa clung know no truer god and from those
forc she strove to wring their secret for her heart wa deep lone
invoc to the goddess beneath the light of the moon appeal to
her for from them she seem to draw strength and comfort but the
outward ceremoni of her faith or the more secret and darker of them
of which in practic she knew littl were alreadi an abomin in her
ey and now what if the jew prophet spoke truli what if thi creed of
her were a lie root and branch and there did lie in the heaven abov
a lord and father who heard and answer the prayer of men and who did
not seek of them the blood of the children he had given
a great doubt took hold of elissa and shook her be and with the
doubt came hope how wa itif her faith were truethat when she took
the name of the goddess in vain noth had befallen her she desir
to learn more of thi matter but who wa to teach her the levit
turn from her with loath as from a thing unclean and there
remain therefor but the princ aziel who had put her from him with
those bitter word of scorn ah why did thei pain her so pierc her
heart as with a spear wa it becausebecauseh had grown dear to
her ye that wa the truth she had learn it even as he curs her
all her quick southern blood wa alight with a new fire the like of
which she had never known befor and not her blood onli it wa her
spirith spirit that yearn to hi had it not leapt within her
at the first sight of him as to on most dear on longlost and found
again she love him and he loath her and oh her lot wa hard
as elissa lai brood thu in her pain the door open and sakon her
father hurri into the chamber
what is it that chanc yonder he ask for he had not been present
in the sanctuari and daughter why do you weep
i weep father becaus your guest the princ aziel ha call me a
girl of the grove and a murderess of children she repli
then by my head princ that he is he shall answer for it to me
said sakon grasp at hi swordhilt
nai father sinc to him i must have seem to deserv the word
listen and she told him all that had pass hide noth
now it seem that troubl is heap upon troubl said the phoenician
when she had finish and thei were mad who suffer the princ and
that fierc issachar to be present at the sacrific daughter i tell
you thi though i am a worshipp of el and baalti as my father were
befor me i know that jehovah of the jew is a great and power lord
and that hi prophet do not prophesi fals for i have seen it in my
youth yonder in the coast of sidon what did issachar sai that befor
the moon wa young again thi templ should run red with blood well
so it mai happen for ithob threaten war against us and for your
sake my daughter
how for my sake father she ask heavili as on who knew what the
answer would be
you know well girl ever sinc you danc befor him at the great
welcom feast i made in hi honour a month ago the man is besot
of you moreov he is mad with jealousi of thi newcom the princ
aziel he ha demand public audienc of me thi afternoon and i have
it privat that then he will formal ask you in marriag befor the
peopl and if he is refus will declar war upon the citi with which
he ha mani an ancient quarrel ye ye king ithob is that sword
of god which the jew said he saw hang over us and should it fall it
will be becaus of you elissa
the jew did not sai that father he said it would be becaus of the
sin of the peopl and their idolatri
what doe it matter what he said broke in sakon hastili how shall i
answer ithob
tell him she repli with a strang smile that he doe wise to be
jealou of the princ aziel
what of the stranger who thi veri dai revil you in word of such
shame and so soon ask her father astonish
elissa did not speak in answer she onli look straight befor her and
nod her head
had ever man such a daughter sakon went on in petul dismai truli
it is a wise sai which tell that women love those best who beat
them be it with the tongu or with the fist not but what i would
gladli see you wed to a princ of israel and of egypt rather than of
thi halfbr barbarian but the legion of solomon and of pharaoh ar
far awai wherea ithob ha a hundr thousand spear almost at our
gate
there is no need to speak of such thing father she said turn
asid sinc even were i will the princ would have nought to do
with me who am a priestess of baalti
the matter of religion might be overcom suggest sakon but no
for mani reason it is imposs well thi be so daughter i mai
answer ithob that you will wed him
i she said i wed that blackheart savag my father you mai
answer what you will but of thi be sure that i will go to my grave
befor i pass as wife to the board of ithob
oh my daughter plead sakon think befor you sai it as hi
wife at least you who ar not of royal blood will be a queen and the
mother of king but if you refus then either i must forc you which
is hate to me or there will be such a war as the citi ha not known
for gener for ithob and hi tribe have mani grievanc against
us by the gift of yourself for a while at ani rate you can as it
chanc make peac between us but if that is withheld then blood will
run in river and perhap thi citi with all who live in it will
be destroi or at the least it trade must be ruin and it wealth
stolen awai
if it is decre that all these thing ar to be thei will be
answer elissa calmli see that thi war ha threaten us for mani
year and that a woman must think of herself first and of the fate of
citi afterward of my own free will i shall never take ithob for
husband father i have said
of the fate of citi ye but how of my fate and that of those we
love ar we all to be ruin and perhap slaughter to satisfi your
whim girl
i did not sai so father i said that of my own free will i would not
wed ithob if you choos to give me to him you have the right to do
it but know then that you give me to my death perhap it is best that
it should be thu
sakon knew hi daughter well and it did not need that he should glanc
at her face to learn that she meant her word also he love her hi
onli child more dearli than anyth on earth
in truth my strait is hard and i know not which wai to turn he said
cover hi face with hi hand
father she repli lai her finger lightli on hi shoulder what
need is there to answer him at onc take a month or if he will not
give it a week much mai happen in that time
the counsel is wise he said catch at thi straw daughter be in
the great hall of audienc with your attend three hour after noon
for then we must receiv ithob boldli in all pomp and deal with
him as best we mai and now i go to ask peac for the levit from
the priest of el and to discov whom the sacr colleg desir to
nomin as the new baalti doubtless it will be mesa the daughter
of her who is dead though mani ar against her oh if there were no
priest and no women thi citi would be easier to govern and with an
impati gestur sakon left the room
it wa three oclock in the afternoon and the great hall of audienc
in zimbo wa crowd with a brilliant assemblag there sat sakon the
governor and with him hi council of the notabl of the citi
there were princ aziel and among hi retinu issachar the prophet
fierceei as ever though hardli recov from the rough handl he
had experienc in the templ there were repres of the colleg
of the priest of el there were mani ladi wive and daughter
of dignitari and wealthi citizen and with them a great crowd of
spectat of all class gather in the lower part of the hall for
a rumour had spread about that the farewel audienc given by sakon to
king ithob wa like to be stormi
when all were gather a herald announc that ithob king of the
tribe wait to take hi leav of sakon governor of zimbo befor
depart to hi own land on the morrow
let him be admit said sakon who look weari and ill at eas
then as the herald bow and left he turn and whisper someth
into the ear of hi daughter elissa who stood behind hi chair
her face immov as that of an egyptian sphinx but magnific
apparel in gleam robe and jewel ornamentswhich metem
look on them reflect with satisfact were now hi properti
present preced by a burst of savag music ithob enter he wa
gorgeous arrai in a purpl tyrian robe deck with golden chain
while on the brow in token of hi royalti he wore a golden circlet in
which wa set a singl bloodr stone befor him walk a swordbear
carri a sword of ceremoni a magnific ivoryhandl weapon
encrust with rough gem and inlaid with gold while behind him clad
in barbar pomp march a number of counsellor and attend huge
and halfsavag men who glare wonderingli at the splendour of the place
and it occup as the king came sakon rose from hi chair of state
and advanc down the hall took him by the hand and led him to a
similar chair place at a littl distanc
ithob seat himself and look around the hall present hi glanc
fell upon aziel and he scowl
is it common sakon he ask that the seat of a princ should be
set higher than that of a crown king and he point to the chair of
aziel which wa place a littl abov hi own upon the da
the governor wa about to answer when aziel said coldli
where it wa point out to me that i should sit there i sat though
for aught i care the king ithob mai take my place the grandson of
pharaoh and of solomon doe not need to disput for preced with the
savag ruler of savag tribe
ithob sprang to hi feet and cri grasp hi sword
by my father soul you shall answer for thi princelet
you should have sworn by your mother soul king ithob repli
aziel quietli for doubtless it is the black blood in your vein that
caus you to forget your courtesi for the rest i answer to no man
save to my king
yet there is on other who will make you answer repli ithob in
a voic thick with rage and here he is and he drew hi sword and
flash it befor the princ ey or if you fear to face him then
the wand of my slave shall caus you to cry me pardon
if you desir to challeng me to combat king ithob for thi purpos
onli i am your servant though the fashion of your challeng is not
that of ani nation which i know
befor ithob could repli sakon cri out in a loud voic
enough enough is thi a place for brawl king ithob and would
you seek to fix a quarrel upon my guest the princ aziel here in my
council chamber and to bring upon me the wrath of israel of tyre and
of egypt be sure that the princ shall cross no sword with you no
not if i have to set him under guard to keep him safe to your busi
king ithob or i break up thi assembl and send you under escort to
our gate
now hi counsellor pluck ithob by the sleev and whisper to him
some advic which at last he seem to take with an ill grace for
turn he said so be it thi is my busi sakon for mani year
i and the countless tribe whom i rule have suffer much at the hand
of you phoenician who centuri ago settl here in my countri as
trader that you should trade we ar content but not that you should
establish yourselv as a sovereign power pretend to be my equal
who ar my servant therefor in the name of my nation i demand that
the tribut which you pai to me for the us of the mine of gold shall
henceforth be doubl that the defenc of thi citi be thrown down
and that you ceas to enslav the nativ of the land to labour in your
servic i have spoken
now as these arrog demand reach their ear the compani assembl
in the hall murmur with anger and astonish then turn to wait
for sakon answer
and if we refus these small request of your o king ask the
governor sarcast what then will you make war upon us
first tell me sakon if you do refus them
in the name of the citi of tyre and sidon whom i serv and of hiram
my master i refus them on and all answer sakon with digniti
then sakon i am mind to bring up a hundr thousand men against you
and to sweep you and your citi from the face of earth said ithob
yet i rememb that i also have phoenician blood in my vein mix with
the nobler and more ancient blood at which yonder upstart jeer and
therefor i would spare you i rememb also that for gener there
ha been peac and amiti between my forefath and the council of thi
citi and therefor i would spare you behold then i build a bridg
wherebi you mai escap ask but on littl thing of you in proof that
you ar inde my friend and it is that you give me your daughter the
ladi elissa whom i seek to make my queen think well befor you answer
rememb that upon thi answer mai hang the live of all who listen
to you ay and of mani thousand other
for a while there wa silenc in the assemblag and everi ey wa fix
upon elissa who stood neither move nor speak her face still set
like that of a sphinx and almost as unread aziel gaze at her with
the rest and hi ey she felt alon of all the hundr that were bent
upon her inde so strongli did thei draw her that against her own
will she turn her head and met them then rememb what had pass
between herself and the princ that veri dai she colour faintli and
look down neither the glanc nor the blush escap the watch
ithob
present sakon spoke
king ithob he said i am honour inde that you should seek my
daughter as your queen but she is my onli child whom i love and i
have sworn to her that i will not forc her to marri against her will
whoever be the suitor therefor king take your answer from her own
lip for whatev it be it is my answer
ladi said ithob you have heard your father word be pleas to
sai that you look with favour upon my suit and that you will deign to
share my throne and power
elissa took a step forward on the da and curtsei low befor the
king
o king she said i am your handmaid and great inde is the favour
that you would do your servant yet king i prai of you search out some
fairer woman of a more royal rank to share your crown and sceptr for i
am all unworthi of them and to those word on thi matter which i
have spoken in past dai i have none to add then again she curtsei
ad king i am your servant
now a murmur of astonish went up from the audienc for few of them
thought it possibl that elissa who howev beauti wa but the
daughter of a nobl could refus to becom the wife of a king ithob
alon did not seem to be astonish for he had expect thi answer
ladi he said repress with an effort the passion which were
surg within him i think that i have someth to offer to the
woman of my choic and yet you put me asid as lightli as though i had
neither name nor power nor station thi as it seem to me can be
read in on wai onli that your heart is given elsewher
have it as you will king answer elissa my heart is given
elsewher
and yet ladi not four sun gone you swore to me that you love no
man sinc then it seem that you have learn to love and swiftli
and it is yonder jew whom you have chosen and he point to the princ
aziel
again elissa colour thi time to the ey but she show no other
sign of confus
mai the king pardon me she said and mai the princ aziel whose
name ha thu been coupl with mine pardon me i said inde that my
heart wa given elsewher but i did not sai it wa given to ani
man mai not the heart of a mortal maidpriestess be given to the
everliv
now for a moment the king wa silenc while a murmur of applaus at
her readi wit went round the audienc but befor it di awai a voic
at the far end of the hall call out
perchanc the ladi doe not know that yonder in egypt and in jerusalem
also princ aziel is name the everliv
now it wa elissa turn to be overcom
nai i knew it not she said how should i know it i spoke of that
dweller in the heaven whom i worship
and behold the titl fit a dweller on the earth whom you must also
worship for such omen do not come by chanc cri the same voic
but from anoth quarter of the crowd hall
i ask pardon broke in aziel and leav to speak it is true that
ow to a certain birthmark which i bear among the egyptian i have
been given the byenam of the everliv but it is on which thi
ladi can scarc have heard therefor jest no more upon a chanc
accid of word moreov if you be men ceas to heap insult upon
a woman i who am almost a stranger here have not dare to ask the ladi
elissa for her favour
ay but you will ask and she will grant answer the same voic the
owner of which none could discoverfor he seem to speak from everi
part of the chamber
inde went on aziel not heed the interrupt the last
word between us were word of anger for we quarrel on a matter of
religion
what of that cri the voic love is the highest of religion for
do not the phoenician worship it
seiz yonder knave shout sakon and search wa made but without
avail afterward howev aziel rememb that onc when thei were
weatherbound on their journei from the coast metem had amus them by
make hi voic sound from variou quarter of the hut in which thei
lai then ithob rose and said
enough of thi folli i am not here to juggl with word or to listen
to such plai whether the ladi elissa spoke of the god she serv or of
a man is on to me i care not of whom she spoke but for her word i
do care now hearken you citi of trader if thi is to be thy answer
then i break down that bridg which i have built and it is war between
you and my tribe war to the end but let her chang her word and
whether she love me or love me not come to be my wife and for my
dai the bridg shall stand for onc that we ar wed i can sure teach
her love or if i cannot at least it is she i seek with or without her
love reflect then ladi and repli again rememb how much hang
upon your lip
do you think king ithob elissa answer look at him with angri
ey that a woman such as i am can be won by threat i have spoken
king ithob
i know not he repli but i do know that she can be won by forc
and then sure ladi your pride shall pai the price for you shall be
mine but not my queen
now on of the council rose and said
it seem sakon that there is more in thi matter than whether or no
the king ithob pleas your daughter is the citi then to be plung
into a great war of which none can see the end becaus on woman look
askanc upon a man better that a thousand girl should be wed where
thei would not than that such a thing should happen sakon accord
to our ancient law you have the right to give your daughter in marriag
where and when you will we demand therefor that for the good of the
commonwealth you should exercis thi right and hand over the ladi
elissa to king ithob
thi speech wa receiv with loud and gener shout of approv for
no phoenician audienc would have been will to sacrific it interest
for a thing so trivial as the happi of a woman
between the desir of a belov daughter to whom i have pledg my
word and my duti to the great citi over which i rule my strait is hard
inde answer sakon hearken king ithob i must have time give
me eight dai from now in which to answer you for if you will not i
deni your suit
ithob seem about to refus the demand of sakon then onc more hi
counsellor pluck him by the sleev point out to him that if he
did thi it wa like that none of them would leav the citi aliv at
some sign from the governor thei whisper the captain of the guard
were alreadi hasten from the hall
so be it sakon he said tonight i camp without your wall which
ar no longer safe for on who ha threaten war against them and on
the eighth dai from thi see to it that your herald be me the ladi
elissa and peaceor i make good my threat till then farewel and
place himself in the midst of hi compani king ithob left the hall
chapter vii

then he open the roll and read it ran thu though we part with
bitter word still in my sore distress i crave the comfort of your

the great fig tree with five root where i shall be accompani onli by

aziel thrust the scroll into hi robe and thought awhil then he gave
the wait ladi a piec of gold and said
tell her who sent you that i obei her word farewel
thi messag seem to puzzl the woman who open her lip to speak
then chang her mind she turn and went
scarc had she gone when the phoenician metem wa usher into the
room
o princ he said malici pardon me if i caution you yet in
truth if veil ladi flit thu through your apart in the light of
dai it will reach the ear of the holi but violent issachar of whose
do i come to speak then princ i trembl for you
aziel made a movement halfimpati and halfcontemptu the woman
is a servingmaid he said who brought me a messag that i understand
but littl tell me metem for you know thi place of old doe there
stand in the palac garden a great fig tree with five root
ye princ at least such a tree us to grow there when last i
visit thi countri it wa on of the wonder of the town becaus of
it size what of it
littl except that i must be under it at moonris see and read sinc
whatev you mai sai of yourself you ar i think no traitor

smile then he read the scroll
i am glad that the nobl ladi bring an attend with her he said as
he return it with a bow the gossip of zimbo ar censori and
might misinterpret thi moonlight meet as inde would sakon and
issachar well dove will coo and maid will woo and unless i can make
monei out of it the affair is none of mine

went on and i alwai keep my word
i understand princ well sinc you turn from the ladi whose name
with your is so much in men mouth just now doubtless you will give
her wise counsel name to wed ithob and lift the shadow of war
from thi citi then inde we shall all be grate to you for it

if when she ha listen to your wisdom the daughter of sakon
should chanc to explain to you that the sight of thi dai attempt
sacrific fill her with horror and that she part with everi jewel
she own to put an end to itwel her word will be true but sinc
you have quarrel thei will have no more interest for you princ
than ha my talk about them so now to other matter and metem
began to speak of the conduct of issachar in the sanctuari and of the
necess of guard him against assassin at the hand of the
priest of el as a consequ of hi religi zeal present he wa
gone leav aziel somewhat bewild
could it be true as she herself had told him and as metem now
assert that elissa had not particip willingli in the dark rite
in the templ if so he had misjudg her and been unjust inde what
aton could suffic for such word as he had us toward her well
to some extent she must have understood and forgiven them otherwis she
would scarc have sought hi aid though he knew not how he could help
her in her distress
when elissa return from the assembl she laid herself down to rest
worn out in mind and bodi soon sleep came to her and with the sleep
dream at first these were vagu and shadowi then thei grew more
clear she dream that she saw a dim and moonlit garden and in it
a vast tree with twist root that seem familiar to her someth
move among the branch of thi tree attract her attent but for
a long while she watch it without be abl to discov what it wa
now she saw the move thing wa a hideou black dwarf with beadi ey
who held in hi hand a littl ivori tip bow on the string of which
wa set an arrow her conscious concentr itself upon thi arrow
and though she knew not how she becam awar that it wa poison
what wa the dwarf do in the tree with a bow and poison arrow
she wonder suddenli a sound seem to strike her ear the sound of a
man footstep walk over grass and she perceiv that the figur of
the dwarf crouch upon the bough becam tens and alert and that hi
finger tighten upon the bowstr until the blood wa driven from
their yellow tip follow the glanc of hi wick black ey she
saw advanc through the shadow a tall man clad in a dark robe now he
emerg into a patch of moonlight and stood look around him as though
he were search for some on then the dwarf rais himself to hi
knee upon the bough and aim at the bare throat of the man drew
the bowstr to hi ear at thi moment the victim turn hi head and
the moonlight shone full upon hi face it wa that of the princ aziel
elissa awok from her vision with a littl cry then rose trembl and
strove to comfort herself in the thought that although it wa so veri
vivid she had dream but a dream still shaken and unnerv she pass
into anoth chamber and made pretenc to eat of the meal that wa made
readi for her for it wa now the hour of sunset while she wa thu
emploi it wa announc that the phoenician metem desir to speak
with her and she command that he should be admit
ladi he said bow so soon as her attend had withdrawn to the
farther end of the chamber you can guess my errand thi morn i
gave you certain tide which prove both true and us and for
those tide you promis a reward
it is so she said and go to a chest she drew from it an ivori
casket full of ornament of gold and among them necklac and other
object set with uncut preciou stone take them she said thei ar

revil me
metem lift hi eyebrow incredul and went on still i will not
depriv you of thi woman gear look now i valu it and at no high
figur and draw out hi writer palett and a slip of papyru he
wrote upon it an acknowledg of debt which he ask her to sign

moonris or at ani other hour
metem bow polit but in a fashion which show that he put no faith
in her word
again i ask your mean merchant she said for your dark hint
ar scarc to be born
the phoenician look at her there wa a ring of truth in her voic
ladi he said will you inde deni after i have seen it written by
yourself that within some few minut you meet the princ aziel beneath
a great tree in the palac garden thereso said the scrollto ask
hi aid in thi matter of the suit of ithob
written by myself she said wonderingli meet the princ aziel
beneath a tree in the palac garden never have i thought of it
yet ladi the scroll i saw purport to be written by you and your
own woman bore it to the princ as i think she sit yonder at the end
of the chamber for i know her shape
come hither call elissa address the woman now tell me what
scroll wa thi that you carri todai to the princ aziel sai that

be the wors for you
ladi thi is the truth as i wa walk through the marketplac
an old black woman met me and offer me a piec of gold if i would
deliv a letter into the hand of the princ aziel the gold tempt
me for i had need of it and i consent but of who wrote the letter i
know noth nor have i ever seen the woman befor
you have done wrong girl said elissa but i believ your tale now
go
when she had gone elissa stood for a while think and as she
thought metem saw a look of fear gather on her face
sai she ask him is there anyth strang about the tree of which
the scroll tell
it size is strang he answer and it ha five root that stand
abov the ground
as he spoke elissa utter a littl cry
ah she said it is the tree of my dream nownow i understand
swift oh come with me swiftli for see the moon rise and she
sprang to the door follow by the amaz metem
anoth minut and thei were speed down the narrow street so fast
that those who loiter there turn their head and laugh for thei
thought that a jealou husband pursu hi wife as elissa fumbl at
the hasp of the door of the garden metem overtook her
what mean thi hunt he gasp
that thei have decoi the princ here to murder him she answer
and sped through the gatewai
therefor we must be murder also a woman logic the phoenician
reflect to himself as he pant after her
swiftli as elissa had run down the street here she redoubl her speed
flit through the glade like some white spirit and so rapidli that
her companion found it difficult to keep her in view at length thei
came to a larg open space of ground where plai the level beam of the
rise moon strike upon the dens green foliag of an immens tree
that grew there round thi tree elissa ran glanc about her wildli
so that for a few second metem lost sight of her for it mass wa
between them when he saw her again she wa speed toward the figur
of a man who stood in the open about ten pace from the outer bough
of the tree to thi she point as she came cry out aloud bewar
bewar
anoth moment and she had almost reach the man and still point
began to gasp some broken word then suddenli in the bright moonlight
metem saw a shine point of light flash toward the pair from the
dark of the tree it would seem that elissa saw it also at least
she leapt from the ground her arm lift abov her head as though to
catch the object then as her feet onc more touch the earth her
knee gave wai and she fell down with a moan of pain metem run on
toward her as he went perceiv a shape which look like that of a
black dwarf slip from the shadow of the tree into some bush beyond
where it wa lost now he wa there to find elissa halfseat
halfli on the ground the princ aziel bend over her and fix
through the palm of her right hand which she held up piteous a
littl ivorypoint arrow
draw it out from the wound he pant
it will not help me she answer the arrow is poison
with an exclam metem knelt besid her and not heed her groan
of pain drew the dart through the pierc palm then he tore a strip
of linen from hi robe and knot it round elissa wrist he took a
broken stick that lai near and twist the linen till it almost cut into
her flesh
now princ he said suck the wound for i have no breath for it
fear not ladi i know an antidot for thi arrow poison and present
i will be back with the salv till then if you would live do not
suffer that bandag to be loos howev much it pain you and he
depart swiftli
aziel put hi lip to the hurt to draw out the poison
nai she said faintli try to pull awai her hand it is not
fit the venom mai kill you
it seem that it wa meant for me he answer so at the worst i do
take but my own
present direct elissa to hold her hand abov her head he put hi
arm about her and carri her a hundr pace or more into the open
glade
why do you move me she ask her head rest on hi shoulder
becaus whoever it wa that shot the arrow mai return to try hi
fortun a second time and here in the open hi dart cannot reach us
then he set her down upon the grass and stood look at her
listen princ aziel elissa said after a while the venom with which
these black men soak their weapon is veri strong and unless metem
salv be good it mai well chanc that i shall die therefor befor
i die i wish to sai a word to you what brought you to thi place
tonight
a letter from yourself ladi
i know it she said but i did not write that letter it wa a snare
set as i think by the king ithob who would do you to death in thi
wai or in that a messeng of hi bribe my waitingmaid to deliv it
and afterward i learnt the tale from metem then guess all i came
hither to try to save you
but how could you guess all ladi
in a strang fashion princ and in a few word she told him her
dream
thi is marvel inde that you should be warn of my danger by
vision he said wonder and halfdoubtingli
so marvel princ that you do not believ me elissa answer
i know well what you think you think that a woman to whom thi
veri morn you spoke such word as women cannot well forgiv be
reveng laid a plot to murder you and then be a woman chang
her mind well it is not so metem can prove it to you
ladi i believ you he said without need the testimoni of metem
but now the stori grow still more strang for if you had done me no
wrong how come it that to preserv me from harm you set your tender
flesh between the arrow and on who had revil you
it wa by chanc she answer faintli i learnt the truth and ran
to warn you then i saw the arrow fly toward your heart and strove to
grasp it and it pierc me it wa by chanc by such a chanc as made
me dream your danger and she faint
chapter viii
aziel plight hi troth
at first aziel fear that the poison had done it work and that
elissa wa dead till place hi hand upon her heart he felt it beat
faintli and knew that she did but swoon to leav her to seek water
or assist wa imposs sinc he dare not loos hi hold of the
bandag about her wrist so patient as he might he knelt at her side
await the return of metem
how beauti her pale face seem there in the moonlight set in it
frame of duski hair and how strang wa thi tale of her of a dream
that she had dream a dream which to save hi own led her to offer
her life to the murder arrow mani would not believ it but he felt
that it wa true he felt that even if she wish it she could not lie
to him for as he had known sinc first thei met their soul were
open to each other ye have thu been warn of hi danger she
had offer her life for himfor him who that morn had call her
unjustli so metem said a girl of the grove and a murderess how came
it that she had done thi unless inde she love him ash love her
aziel could no longer palter with himself it wa the truth last night
when issachar accus him he had felt thi although then he would not
admit it altogeth and now tonight he knew that hi fate had found
him thei would sai that after the common fashion of men he had been
conquer by a love face and form and a brave deed of devot but it
wa not so someth beyond the flesh and it work and attribut drew
him toward thi woman someth that he could neither understand nor
defin unless inde the vision of issachar defin it but of which
he had been consciou sinc first he set ey upon her face it wa
possibl it wa even probabl that befor anoth hour had gone by she
would have pass beyond hi reach into the deep of death whither for
a while he could not follow her yet he knew that the knowledg that she
never could be hi would not affect the love of her which burnt in him
for hi desir toward her wa not altogeth a desir of the earth
aziel bent down over the swoon girl look into her pale face
till her lip almost touch hi own and hi breath beat on her brow
seem to give her life again now she stir and now she open her
ey and gaze back at him a while deepli and with mean even as he
gaze at her
he spoke no word for hi lip seem to be smitten with silenc but
hi heart said i love you i love you and her heart heard it for
she whisper back
bethink you who and what i am
it matter not for we ar on he repli
bethink you she said again that soon i mai be dead and lost to
you
it cannot be for we ar on he repli on we have been on
we ar todai and on we shall be through all the length of life and
death
princ she said again onc more and for the last time i sai
bethink you well for it come upon me that your word ar true and
that if i take that which tonight you offer it will be for ever and
for ay
for ever and ay let it be aziel said lean toward her
for ever and for ay let it be she repeat hold up her lip to
hi
and thu in the silent moonlit garden thei plight their strang troth
ladi said a voic in their ear the voic of metem i prai you let
me dress your hand for there is no time to lose
aziel look up to see the phoenician bend over them with a sardon
smile and behind him the tall form of issachar who stood regard
them hi arm fold on hi breast
holi issachar went on metem with malic be pleas to hold thi
ladi hand sinc it seem that the princ here can onli tend her
lip
nai answer the levit what have i to do with thi daughter of
baalti cure her if you can or if you cannot let her die for so
shall a stone of stumbl be remov from the feet of the foolish and
he glanc indignantli at aziel
had it not been for thi same stone at least the feet of the foolish by
now would have point skyward the god send me such a stone if ever a
black dwarf draw a poison arrow at me answer metem as he busi
himself with hi drug then he ad nai princ do not stop to
answer him but hold the ladi hand to the light
aziel obei and have wash out the wound with water metem rub
ointment into it which burnt elissa so sore that she groan aloud
be patient beneath the pain ladi he said for if it ha not alreadi
pass into your blood thi salv will eat awai the poison of the
arrow
then halflead and halfcarri her thei brought her back to the
palac here metem gave her over into the care of her father tell
him as much of the stori as he thought wise and caution him to keep
silent concern what had happen
at the door of the palac issachar spoke to aziel
did i dream princ he said or did my ear inde hear you tell
that idolatress that you love her for ever and did my ey see you
kiss her on the lip
it seem that you saw and heard these thing issachar said aziel
set hi face sternli now hear thi further and then i prai you
give me peac on thi matter of the ladi elissa if in ani wai it is
possibl i shall make her my wife and if it be not possibl then for
so long as she mai live at least i will look upon no other woman
then that is good new princ to me who am charg with your
welfar for be sure if i can prevent you you shall never mix your
life with that of thi heathen sorceress
issachar the princ repli i have born much from you becaus
i know well that you love me and have stood to me in the place of a
father but now in my turn i warn you do not seek to work harm to the
ladi elissa for in strike her you strike me and such blow mai bring
my vengeanc after them
vengeanc mock the levit i fear but on vengeanc and it is not
your nor do i listen to the whisper of love when duti point the
path rather would i see you dead princ aziel then lure down to hell
by the wile of yonder witch
then befor aziel could answer he turn and left him
as issachar went to hi own chamber full of bitter and indign
he pass the door of elissa apart and came face to face with
metem issu from them
will the woman live he ask of him
be comfort worthi issachar i think so that is if the bandag doe
not slip i go to tell the princ
gladli would i give a hundr golden shekel to him who brought me
tide that it had slip and the woman with it down to the arm of
her father beelzebub broke in the levit passion
pretti word for a holi man said metem feign amaz well
issachar i will do most thing for good monei but to shift that
bandag would be but murder and thi i cannot work even for the gold
and to win your favour
fool answer issachar did i ask you to do murder i do not fight
with such weapon let the woman live or die as it is decre nai
enter my chamber for i would speak with you who ar a cun man
vers in the craft of court listen now i love thi princ aziel for
i have rear him from hi childhood and he ha been a son to me who
have none more i am sent hither to thi hate land to watch him and
hold him from harm and for all that chanc to him i must account and
now what ha chanc thi woman elissa by her witcheri
softli issachar what witcheri doe she need beyond those lip and
form and ey
by her witcheri i tell you ha ensnar him so that now he swear
that he will wed her
what of it issachar he might travel far to find a loveli woman
what of it do you ask rememb who he is what of it when you
know hi faith and that thi fair idolat will sap it and caus him
to cast awai hi soul what of it when with your own ear you heard him
swear to love her through all the deep of life and death man ar you
mad
no but some might sai that you ar holi father who forget that i
am also of thi religion which you revil but for good or ill so the
matter stand and now what is it that you wish of me
i wish that you should make it imposs that the princ aziel should
take thi woman to wife not by murder inde for thou shalt not
kill saith the law but by bring it about that she should marri the
king ithob or if that fail in ani other fashion which seem good to
you
thou shalt not kill saith your law tell me then issachar doe it
sai also that thou shalt hand over a woman to a fate that she chanc
to hold to be wors than death doubtless it is foolish of her and we
should not heed such woman folli yet thi on ha a certain strength
of will and i question if all the elder of the citi will bring her
live to the arm of ithob
it is nought to me metem if she wed ithob or wed him not save
that i do not love thi heathen man and sure her temper and her
witcheri would bring ruin on him what i would have you do is to
prevent her from marri aziel the wai i leav to you
and what should i be paid for thi servic holi issachar
the jew thought and answer a hundr golden shekel
two hundr gold shekel repli metem reflect nai i am sure
you said two hundr issachar at least i do not work for less and
it is a small sum enough see that to earn it i must take upon myself
the guilt of sever two love heart but i know well that you ar
right and that thi would be an evil marriag for the princ aziel and
also for the ladi elissa who then dai by dai and year by year must bear
the scourg of your reproach issachar therefor i will do my best
not for the monei inde but becaus i see herein a righteou duti and
now here is parchment give me the lamp that i mai prepar the bond
my word is my bond phoenician answer the levit haughtili
metem look at him doubtless he said but you ar old and thi
isa rough countri where accid chanc at time still the thing

welfar of other and so am i farewel and good dream to you
the levit watch him go mutter to himself ala that i should
have fallen to such traffic with a knave but it is for your sake and
for your soul sake o aziel my son i prai that fate be not too strong
for me and you
for two dai from thi night elissa lai almost senseless and by mani
it wa thought that she would die but when metem saw her on the morn
after she had been wound and note that her arm wa but littl
swollen and had not turn black he announc that she would certainli
live whatev the doctor of the citi might declar thereon sakon her
father and aziel bless him but issachar said noth
as the phoenician wa walk through the marketplac earli on the next
dai an ag black woman whom he did not know accost him sai
that she had a messag for hi ear from the king ithob who wa camp
without the citi and who desir to see the merchandis that he had
brought with him from the coast of tyre now metem had alreadi sold
all hi ware at a great advantag still as he would not neglect thi
opportun of trade he purchas other from hi fellow merchant and
load two camel with them set out for the camp of ithob ride on
a mule by middai he had reach it the camp wa pitch near water in
a pleasant grove of tree and on on of these not far from the tent of
ithob metem note that there hung the bodi of a black dwarf
behold the fate of him who shoot at the buck and hit the doe well i
have alwai said that murder is a danger game sinc blood call out
for blood thought metem as he rode toward the tent
at it door stood king ithob look veri huge and sullen in the
sunlight metem dismount and prostrat himself obsequi
mai the king live for ever he said the great king the king to whom
all the other king of the earth ar as the littl god to baal or the
faint star to the sun
rise and ceas from flatteri said ithob shortli i mai be
greater than the other king but at least you do not think it
if the king sai so so let it be repli metem calmli a woman
yonder in the marketplac told me that the king wish to trade for
my merchandis so i have brought the best of it priceless good that
which much toil i have carri hither from tyre and he point to the
two camel laden with the inferior articl which he had purchas and
began to read the number and descript of the good from hi tablet
what valu do you set upon the whole of them merchant ask ithob
to the trader of the countri so much but to you o king so much
onli and he name a sum twice that which he had paid in the citi
so be it assent ithob indiffer i do not haggl over ware
though your price is larg present my treasur shall weigh you out
the gold
there wa a moment paus then metem said
the tree in thi camp of your bear evil fruit o king if i might
ask why doe that littl black monkei hang yonder
becaus he tri to do murder with hi poison arrow answer
ithob sullenli
and fail well it must comfort you to think that he did fail if he
wa of the number of your servant it is strang now that some knave
unknown attempt murder last night in the palac garden also with
poison arrow i sai attempt but as yet i cannot be sure that he
did not succe
what exclaim ithob wa and he stop
no king princ aziel wa not hit the ladi elissa took that shaft
through her hand and li between life and death i am doctor her
and had it not been for my skill she would now be stiff and blacka
the rogu who shot the arrow
save her said ithob hoars and i will pai you a doctor fee
of a hundr ounc of pure gold oh had i but known the clumsi fool
should not have di so easili
metem took out hi tablet and made a note of the amount
take comfort king he said i think that i shall earn the fee
but to speak truth thi matter look somewhat ugli and your name is
mention in it also it is said that your cousin the great man whom
the princ aziel slew wa charg to abduct a certain ladi by your
order
then fals tale ar told in zimbo and not for the first time
answer ithob coldli listen merchant i have a question to ask
of you will the princ aziel meet me in singl combat with whatev
weapon he mai choos
doubtless andpardon me if i sai itslai you as he slew your cousin
for he is a fine swordsman who ha studi the art in egypt where it
is understood and your strength would not avail against him but your
question is alreadi answer for though the princ would be glad enough
to fight you sakon will have none of it have you noth els to ask
me king
ithob nod and said
listen merchant i know your reput of old that you love monei and
will do much to gain it and that you ar craftier than ani hillsid
jackal now if you can do my will you will have more wealth than ever
you won in your life befor
the offer sound good in a poor man ear king but it depend upon
what is your will
ithob went to the door of the tent and command the sentri who
stood without to suffer none to disturb him or draw near then he
return and said
i will tell you but bewar that you do not betrai my counsel in thi
or in ani other matter for i have sharp ear and a long arm you know
how thing ar between me and the ladi elissa and her father sakon and
the citi which he govern thei stand thu unless within eight dai
she is given to me in marriag i have sworn that i will make war upon
zimbo ay and i will make it for fill with hate for the white man
alreadi the great tribe ar gather to my banner in ten armi each
of them ten thousand strong onc let them march beneath yonder wall
and befor thei leav it zimbo citi of gold shall be noth but a
heap of ruin and a habit of the dead such shall be my vengeanc
but i seek love more than vengeanc for what will it avail me to
butcher all that peopl of trader ifa well mai chanc in the
accid of wari lose her whom i desir whose beauti shall be my
crown of crown and whose mind shall make me great inde
therefor metem if mai be i would win her without war let the war
come afterward as come it must for the time is ripe and though she
turn from me thi i should have done had it not been for yonder
princ aziel whom she met in a strang fashion and straightwai learn
to love now the thing is more difficult nai while the princ aziel
can take her to wife it is wellnigh imposs sinc no threat of war
or ruin can turn a woman heart from him she seeksto him she fli
therefor i ask you
your pardon king metem broke in i see that you like your rival
ar so besot with the beauti of thi girl that in all with which she
ha to do you have lost the rule of your own reason i would save you
perchanc from sai word to which i do not wish to listen and when
you find a quiet mind again that you mai regret have spoken if you
were about to requir of me that i should caus or be privi to the death
of the princ aziel you would requir it in vain ye even if you
were will to pai me gold in mountain and gem in camel load with
murder i will have noth to do moreov the princ your rival is
my friend and master and i will not harm him further i mai tell you
that after the adventur of last night none will be abl to come near
him to hurt a hair of hi head see that through daylight and through
dark he is guard by two men
with a woman bodi to set befor him as a shield said ithob
bitterli but you speak too fast i wa not about to ask you to kill
thi man or even to procur hi death becaus i know it would be
useless but rather that you should so contriv that he cannot take
elissa how you contriv it i care noth so that she is not harm
you mai kidnap him or stir up the citi against him as on destin to
be the sourc of war and caus him to be despatch back to the great
sea or bribe the priest of el to hide him awai or what you will if
onli you separ him from thi woman for ever sai merchant ar you
will to undertak the task or must my good gold go elsewher
metem ponder awhil and answer
i think that i will undertak it king that is if we come to term
though whether i shall succe is anoth matter i will undertak it
not onli becaus i seek to enrich myself but becaus i and other who
serv him think it is a veri evil thing that thi princ aziel whose
blood is the most royal in the whole world without the consent of the
great king of israel hi grandfath should wed the daughter of a
phoenician offic howev beauti and love she mai be also i love
yonder citi which i have known for forti year and would not see it
plung in a bloodi war and perhap destroi becaus a certain man
desir to call a certain girl hi sweetheart and now if i succe in
thi what will you give me
ithob name a great sum
king repli metem you must doubl it for that amount you speak
of i shall be forc to spend in bribe more you must give me the gold
now befor i leav your camp or i will do noth
that you mai steal itand do noth laugh ithob angrili
as you will king such ar my term if thei do not pleas you well
let me go but if you accept them i will sign a bond under which if
within eight dai i do not make it imposs for the princ aziel to
marri the ladi elissa you mai reclaim so much of the gold as i do not
prove to you to have been spent upon your servic and no bond of metem
the phoenician wa ever yet dishonour no on second thought i will
learn wisdom from issachar the levit and put my hand to no write
which it would pain me that some should read king my sworn word must
content you anoth thing soon war mai break out or i mai be forc
to fly therefor i demand of you a pass seal with your seal that
will enabl me to ride with twenti men and all my good and treasur
even through the midst of your armi moreov you shall swear the
great oath to me that notic of thi pass will be given to your gener
and that it shall be respect to the letter do you consent to these
term
i consent said the king present
that even metem return to the citi of zimbo but those who led
hi two camel littl guess that now thei were laden not with
merchandis but with treasur
chapter ix
greet to the baalti
when metem accept bribe from issachar and from ithob in
consider of hi find mean to make the union of aziel and elissa
imposs he had alreadi thought out hi scheme it wa on which
while promot as he consid the true welfar of the lover if
success would separ them effectu and for ever
it will be rememb that elissa had explain to the princ how on
the death of the ladi baalti anoth woman wa elect by the colleg
of the priest and priestess to fill her place thi ladi could marri
inde she wa expect to do so but her husband must take the titl
of shadid and for her lifetim act as highpriest of el therefor
thought metem if it could be brought about that elissa should be chosen
as the new baalti it wa obviou that there would be an end of the
possibl of her marriag to aziel then in order to wed her he must
renounc hi own religiona thing which no jew would doand pose as
the earthli incarn of on whom he consid a fals divin or a
devil
inde not onli marriag but ani further intimaci between the pair
would be render impractic for upon thi point the religi law
lax enough in mani particular wa veri strict in fact so strict wa
it that for the ladi baalti of the dai to be found alon with ani man
meant death to her and him the reason of thi sever wa that she wa
suppos to repres the goddess and her husband the shadid a god
so that ani question behaviour on her part becam an insult to the
most power divin of heaven which could onli be aton by the
death of their unworthi incarn that these law were actual and
not formal onli wa prove by the instanc that within the hundr year
befor the birth of elissa a ladi baalti had been execut for some
such offenc have been hurl inde from the topmost pinnacl of the
fortress abov the templ to the foot of the precipic beneath
all these sacerdot custom were familiar to metem who argu from
them that to procur the nomin of elissa as the baalti would be to
build an impass wall between her and the princ aziel also by wai
of compens that offic would confer upon her the highest digniti
and honour which could be attain by ani woman in the citi moreov
her elect would place her beyond the reach of the persecut
of ithob sinc as ladi baalti she wa entitl to choos her own
husband without hindranc or appeal provid onli that he wa of pure
white blood which ithob wa not
have thought the matter out and convinc himself that such a
cours would not onli benefit hi own pocket but prove to the last
advantag of all concern metem fill with a glow of righteou zeal
set about hi task with the promptitud and cun of hi race it wa
not an easi task for although she had enemi and rival the daughter
of the dead baalti mesa by name wa consid to be certain of
elect at the poll of the priest and priestess thi ceremoni wa
to take place within two dai noth discourag howev by the
scant time at hi dispos or other difficulti without her knowledg
or that of her father metem began hi canvass on behalf of elissa
first with a great sum of gold he bought over the exshadid the husband
of the late ladi baalti as it chanc thi worthi had quarrel with
hi daughter therefor it follow that he would prefer to see some
stranger chosen in her place in the hope that notwithstand hi
year by choos him in marriag she might confirm him in hi posit
of spous to the goddess
all metem further negoti need not be follow monei plai a
part in most of them jealousi and dislik in some a few there were
also whom he won over by urg the beauti and wisdom of elissa and her
extraordinari fit for the post as evinc by her recent inspir
in the templ he found hi most power alli howev among the
member of the council of the citi to these grande he point out
that elissa wa a woman of great strength of charact who would
certainli never consent to be forc into a marriag with ithob
although her refus should mean a desper war and that her father
wa so much under her influenc that he could not be brought to put
pressur upon her therefor it wa obviou that the onli wai out of the
difficulti wa her elect as baalti thi must prove a perfect
answer to the suit of the savag king sinc the goddess could not be
compel and even ithob fear the vengeanc of heaven would
shrink from offer her violenc
there support gain have first sworn him to secreci he attack
sakon himself us similar argument with him he point out in
addit that if the governor hope to see hi daughter marri to
princ aziel who wa in love with her howev dazzl might be the
prospect of such a match it would certainli bring upon him the present
wrath of ithob and in all probabl futur troubl with the
court of egypt of israel and through them of tyre thu work in
mani wai metem labour incessantli to win hi end so that when at
last the hour of elect came he await it issu fairli confid of
success
it wa on thi same afternoon that for the first time sinc she had
receiv the arrow which wa meant for hi heart aziel wa admit to
see elissa now at length her recoveri wa certain although she had not
shaken off her weak and her right arm and wrist were still stiff
and swollen except for two or three of her women who were seat at
their work behind a screen near the far end of the great chamber
she wa alon ly upon a couch in the recess of the windowplac
advanc to her aziel bent down to kiss her wound hand
nai said elissa hide it beneath the fold of her robe it is
still black and unsightli with the poison
the more reason that i should kiss it see how the stain came
there he answer
her ey met hi and she whisper not my hand but my brow princ
for so i shall be crown
he press hi lip upon her forehead and repli
queen of my heart you ar alreadi and though the throne be humbl it
is sure the life you save is your and no other
i did but repai a debt she answer but speak of it no more gladli
would i have di to save you should such choic aris would you do so
for me i wonder
there is littl need to ask such a question ladi for your sake
i would not onli die i would even endur shamethat is wors than
death
sweet word aziel she answer smile of which we shall learn
the valu when the hour of trial come as come i think it will you
told me but now that you were mine and no other but is it so i have
heard the stori of a certain princess of khem with whom your name wa
mingl tell me if you will what wa it that set you journei to
thi far citi of our
the desir to find you he answer smile then see that she
still look at him with question ey he ad nai thi is the
truth if you seek truth inde it is the best that i should tell
you sinc it seem that alreadi you have heard someth of the tale
a while ago i wa sent to the court of the pharaoh of egypt by the will
of my grandsir the king of israel upon an embassi of friendship
and to escort thenc a certain beauti princess my cousin who wa
affianc by treati to an uncl of mine a great princ of israel thi
i did show to the ladi courtesi and no more but the end of the
matter wa that when we came to jerusalem the princess refus to be
marri to my uncl to whom she wa betroth and he hesit
nai be not timid princ said elissa sharpli continu i prai you
i have heard that the ladi ad somewhat to her refus
that is so elissa she declar befor the king that she would wed no
man except myself onli whereon my uncl wa veri angri and accus me
of plai him fals which inde i had not done
although the ladi wa so fair aziel but what said the great king
he said that never have seen him to whom she wa affianc he would
not suffer that she should be forc into marriag with him against
her will yet that her will might be uninfluenc he command that i
should be sent upon a long journei that wa hi judgment ladi
ye but not all of it sure he ad other word she broke in
eagerli
he ad continu aziel with some reluct that if while i
wa on thi journei the princess chang her mind and chose to wed my
uncl it would be well but when i return from it if she had not
chang her mind and choseto marri methen it would be well also
and though he wa littl pleas with thi sai my uncl must be
satisfi
it doe not satisfi me princ aziel elissa answer the tear
start to her dark ey i know full well that the ladi will not
chang her mind and take a man who is in year and whom she hate
in place of on who is young and whom she love therefor when you
return henc to jerusalem by the king command you will wed her
nai elissa if i am alreadi marri that cannot be he said
in judea princ i am told that men take more wive than on also
thei divorc them she repli then ad oh return not there where
i shall lose you if inde you love me i prai you return not there
befor he could answer a sound of sing and of all sort of music
caught aziel ear look through the casement he saw a great
process of the priest and priestess of el and baalti clad in
their festal robe and accompani by mani dignitari of the citi a
multitud of peopl and band of musician advanc across the squar
toward the door of the palac
why what pass he exclaim as he spoke the door open and two
richli arrai herald wand of offic in their hand enter and
prostrat themselv befor elissa
greet to you most nobl and bless ladi the chosen of the god
thei cri with on voic prepar we beseech you to hear glad
tide and to receiv those who ar sent to tell them
glad tide said elissa ha ithob then withdrawn hi suit
nai ladi it is not of ithob that the messeng come to speak
then i cannot receiv them she said sink back in apprehens i
am still ill and weak and i prai to be excus
nai ladi answer the herald that which thei have to tell will

metem and mani other nobl and dignitari
all hail ladi thei cri prostrat themselv befor her all

elissa look at them bewild
your pardon she said i do not understand
then rise from hi knee he who wa still the shadid until hi
successor wa appoint address her as spokesman
listen he said and learn ladi the great thing that ha befallen
you know o divin on that by the inspir of el and baalti
ruler of the heaven the colleg of the priest and priestess of
the citi follow the voic of the oracl and the point of the
omen have set you in that high place which death ha empti greet
to you holder of the spirit of the goddess greet to the baalti
i did not seek thi honour she murmur in the silenc that follow
and i refus it the throne of the goddess is mesa right let her
take it or if she will not then find some other woman who is more
worthi
ladi said the shadid these word becom you well but it ha
pleas the god to choos you and not my daughter the ladi mesa or
ani other woman and the choic of the god mai not be set asid till
death shall take you you and you alon ar the ladi baalti whom we
obei
must i then be made divin against my will she plead and turn to
aziel as though for counsel
be pleas to stand back princ aziel said the stern voic of the
shadid interpos rememb that henceforth no man mai speak to
the baalti save he whom she name with the name of shadid to be her
husband henceforward you ar part sinc to seek her compani would be
to caus her death
now understand that the doom of lifelong separ had fallen upon
them like the sudden sword of fate aziel and elissa gaze at each other
in despair then befor either of them could speak a word at a sign
from the shadid the priestess close round elissa throw a white
veil over her head thei broke into a joy pan of song and halfl
halfcarri her from the chamber to enthron her in the palac of the
goddess which wa henceforth to be her home
present all the compani includ the wait women have join
the process the chamber wa empti with the except of aziel
metem and issachar the levit who drawn by the sound of sing had
enter the place unnot
take comfort princ said the phoenician in a halfbant voic
if you and the ladi baalti ar truli dear to each other she mai still
be your for you have but to bow the knee to el and she will name you
shadid and husband
blasphem not cri issachar sternli shall a worshipp of the god
of israel do sacrific to a demon to win a woman smile
that time will prove answer metem shrug hi shoulder at
least it is certain that he will win it in no other wai princ he
ad chang hi tone if you have ani such thought abandon them
i prai of you for on thi matter the law mai not be broken the man
spoke truth moreov when he told you that should you be found with
the baalti not be her husband you would caus her death
aziel took no notic of hi word but turn to the levit he ask
in a quiet voic
did you plot thi to separ us issachar if so you shall live to
mourn the deed
listen princ broke in metem it wa not issachar who plot that
the ladi elissa should be chosen baalti but i or at least i help
the plot shall i tell you why i did thi it wa to save you and her
and if possibl to prevent a great war also you could not wed thi
woman who is not of your race or rank or religion and if you could
it would bring about a struggl that must cost thousand their live
and thi citi it wealth nor could you make of her less than a wife
see that she is wellborn and that you ar her father guest
therefor for your own sake it is best that she should be place beyond
your reach for her sake also it is best sinc she is ambiti and
born to rule who henceforth will be cloth with power for all her
dai moreov had it been otherwis in the end she must have pass
to that savag ithob whom she hate now thi is scarc possibl
for the ladi baalti can wed no man who is not of pure white blood and
whom she doe not choos of her own free will that is a decre which
mai not be broken even by ithob so revil me not but thank me
though for a littl while your heart be sore
my heart is sore inde answer aziel and if you think your
word be wise their medicin doe not sooth phoenician you mai have
labour for my welfar and for that of the ladi elissa or like the
huckster that you ar for your own advantag or for bothi know not
and do not care to know but thi i know that you and issachar also
ar strive to snare fate in a web of sand and that fate will be too
strong for it and you i love thi woman and she love me becaus
such is our destini and no barrier which man mai build can serv to
separ us also of thi i am assur that by your plot you draw the
evil you would ward awai upon the head of us all for from them shall
spring war and death and miseri
for the rest do not think metem and issachar that i whom you
betrai and the woman you have ruin with a crown of great she
did not seek ar clai to be mould at your will it is anoth hand
than your which fashion the vessel of our destini nor can you stai
our lip from drink of the pure wine that fill it farewel and
with a grave inclin of the head he left the room
metem watch him go then he turn to issachar and said
i have earn my hire well and you must pai the price but now it
troubl me to think that i touch thi busi why it is i cannot
sai but it come upon me that the princ speak truth and that no plot
of our can avail to separ these two who were born to each other
although it well mai happen that we shall unit them in death alon
issachar he ad with fierc convict i will not take your gold
for it is the price of blood i tell you it is the price of blood
take it or no as you will phoenician answer the levit at least
i am well pleas that the promis of it bought your servic even
should the princ aziel discharg thi dai work with hi young life
it is better that he should perish in the bodi than that he should lose
hi soul for the bribe of a woman pass beauti whatev els be
lost that is save to him sinc those sorceress lip of her ar set
beyond hi reach an israelit cannot mate with the oracl of baalti
metem
you sai so issachar but i have seen men climb high to pluck such
fruit ye i have seen them climb even when thei knew that thei must
fall befor the fruit wa reach
then he went also leav issachar alon and oppress with a dread of
the futur which wa none the less real becaus it could not be defin
chapter x
the embassi
weak as she wa still with recent ill halffaint also from
the shock of the terribl and unexpect fate which had overtaken her
elissa wa born in triumph to the palac that now wa her around
her gild litter priestess danc and sang their wild chant
halfbacchanalian and halfreligi befor it march the priest of
el clash cymbal and cry make wai make wai for the newborn
goddess make wai for her whose throne is upon the horn moon while
all about the multitud of spectat prostrat themselv in worship
elissa wa born in triumph vagu she heard the shout and music
dimli she saw the dancinggirl and the bow crowd but all the while
her heart wa aliv with pain and her brain crush beneath the menac
of thi miseri could grasp noth clearli save the complet of
her loss loss ye she wa lost inde on short hour ago and she
wa rejoic in the presenc of the man she love and who as she
believ love her while in her mind rose vision of some happi life
with him far awai from thi citi and the dark rite of the worshipp
of baal and now she found herself the chief priestess of that worship
which alreadi she had learn to fear if not to hate more as it
priestess till death should come to comfort her she wa cut off for
ever from him whom she ador cut off also from the hope of that new
spiritu light which had begun to dawn upon her soul
elissa look upon the beauti women who leapt and sang about her
litter listen to the clash of their ornament of gold and as she
listen and look her ey seem to gain power to behold the spirit
within them sure she could see these dark and hideou thing with
shift counten terribl to look on and themselv wear in
their ey of flame a stamp of etern terror while in her ear the
music of their golden necklac wa chang to a clank as of fetter and
of instrument of torment ye and there befor the dancer in the red
cloud of dust which rose from their beat feet float the dim shape
of that demon of whom she had been chosen the highpriestess
look at her mock inhuman counten and her bent brow of power
look at her spread and flame hair and her hundr hand outstretch
to grasp the soul of men hark the clamour of the cymbal and the cry
of the dancer blend togeth and becam her voic a dread voic
that gave greet to her princess promis her pride of place and
lifelong power in payment for her servic
i desir none of these her heart seem to answer i desir him onli
whom i have lost
is it so repli the voic then bid him burn incens upon my altar
and take him to yourself have i not given you enough of beauti to snare
a singl soul from among the servant of my enemi the god of the jew
nai nai her heart cri i will not tempt him to do thi evil
thing
yea yea mock the phantom voic for your sake he shall burn
incens upon my altar
the phantasi pass and now the golden gate of the palac of baalti
roll open befor elissa now too the priestess bore her to the
golden throne shape like a crescent moon and threw over her a black
veil spangl with star symbol of the night then have shut out the
uniniti thei worship her after their secret fashion till she
sank down upon the throne overcom with fear and weari then at last
thei carri her to that wonder of workmanship and allegor art the
ivori bed of baalti and laid her down to sleep
at dawn upon the follow dai an embassi head by sakon governor
of the citi in whose train were metem and aziel went to the camp of
ithob the mission of these envoi wa to give the king answer to hi
suit for he refus to come to zimbo unless he were allow to bring
a larger forc than it wa thought prudent to admit into the citi gate
at some distanc from the tent thei halt while messeng were sent
forward invit ithob to a confer on the plain as it seem
scarc safe to trust themselv within the stout thorn fenc which had
been built about the camp metem who said that he had no fear of the
king went with these men and on reach the zeriba wa at onc
bidden to the pavilion of ithob he found the great man pace it
length sullenli
what seek you here phoenician he ask glanc at him over hi
shoulder
my fee king the king wa pleas to promis me a hundr ounc
of gold if i save the life of the ladi elissa i come therefor to
assur him that my skill ha prevail against the poison arrow of
that treacher dog of the desert which pierc her hand as she spoke
with the princ aziel the other night and to claim my reward here is a
note of the amount and he produc hi tablet
if half of what i hear is true rogu answer ithob savag the
tormentor and the headsman alon could satisfi all my debt to you sai
merchant what return have you made me for that sack of gold which
you bore henc some few dai gone
the best of all return king answer metem cheerfulli although in
truth he began to feel afraid i have kept my word and fulfil the
command of the king i have made it imposs that the princ aziel
should wed the daughter of sakon
ye rogu you have made it imposs by caus her to be
consecr baalti and thu build a barrier which even i shall find
too hard to climb it is scarc to be hope that now she will choos
me of her own will and to offer violenc to the baalti is a sacrileg
from which ani many even a kingmai shrink for such deed draw
the curs of heaven know that for thi servic i am mind to settl
my account with you in a fashion of which you have not thought have
you heard phoenician that the chief of certain of my tribe love to
decor their spearshaft with the hide of white men and to brai
their flesh into a medicin which give courag to it eater
with thi pleas and suggest queri ithob paus and look
toward the door of the tent as though he were about to call hi guard
now metem blood ran cold for he knew that thi royal savag wa not
on who utter idl threat yet the cool and cun which had so
often serv him well did not fail him in hi need
i have heard that your peopl have strang custom he answer with
a laugh but i think that even a spearshaft would scarc gain beauti
from my wrinkl hide and if anyth the eat of my flesh would
make tradesmen and not warrior of your chief well let the jest pass
and listen king in all my scheme on thought never cross my mind
name that you were a man to suffer scrupl to stand between you and
the woman you would win you think that now she is a goddess well if
that be soand it is not for me to saywho could be a fitter mate for
the greatest king upon the earth than a goddess from the heaven take
her king ithob take her and thi i promis you that when your
armi ar encamp without the wall the priest of el will absolv
you of the crime of aspir to the fair lip of baalti
the lip of baalti broke in ithob do you think that i shall find
them sweet when anoth man ha rifl them secret chamber ar mani
yonder in the palac of the god and doubtless the jew will find hi
wai there
nai king for between these two i have inde built a wall which
cannot be climb the worshipp of the lord of israel mai not traffic
with the highpriestess of ashtoreth moreov i shall bring it about
that er long princ aziel face is set seaward
do that and i will believ you merchant though it would be better if
you could bring it about that hi face wa set earthward as i will
if i can well thi time i spare you though be sure that if aught
miscarri you shall pai the price how i have told you now i go to
talk with these trader these outland of zimbo why do you wait
you ar dismiss andal

i have heard he said humbl that the king ithob the great king
alwai pai hi debt and as ian outlandershal be leav zimbo
shortli under hi safe conduct i desir to close thi small account
ithob went to the door of hi tent and command that hi treasur
should attend him bring monei present he came and at hi lord
bid weigh out on hundr ounc of gold
you ar right phoenician said ithob i alwai pai my debt
sometim in gold and sometim in iron be care that i ow you no
more lest you who todai ar paid in gold tomorrow mai receiv the
iron weigh out in the fashion of which i have spoken now begon
metem gather up the treasur and hide it in hi ampl robe bow
himself from the royal presenc and out of the thornhedg camp
without doubt i have been in danger he said to himself wipe hi
brow sinc at on time that black brute disregard the sanctiti
of an envoi had it in hi mind to tortur and to kill me so so king
ithob metem the phoenician is also an honest merchant who alwai pai
hi debt as you mai learn in the marketplac of jerusalem of sidon
and of zimbo and i ow you a heavi bill for the fright you have given
me todai littl of elissa compani shall you have if i can help it
she is too good for a crossbr savag and if befor i go from these
barbarian land i can set a drop of medicin in your wine or an arrow
in your gizzard upon the word of metem the phoenician it shall be done
king ithob
when metem reach sakon and the envoi he found that a messag had
alreadi been sent to them announc that ithob would meet them

noth for we ar too mani and he glanc at hi soldier a
thousand strong upon the hillsid nor ar the citizen of zimbo the
servant of ani man unless he be the king of tyre
that we shall put to proof sakon said ithob but sai what doe

zimbo

ruler of israel charg me alwai to take note of the wai of savag

hand of the god and anoint her my dancingwoman do you think to make
a mock of me you peopl of zimbo whom i have honour by desir on

then king on your hand be all the innoc live that these word
of your have doom and mai the weight of their wast blood press you
down to ruin and death
thu answer sakon proudli but with pale lip for do what thei would
to hide it someth of the fear thei felt for the issu of thi war
wa written on the face of all hi compani
ithob turn upon hi heel deign no repli but as he went he
whisper a word into the ear of two of hi captain great men of war
who stai behind the rest of hi parti search for someth upon
the ground sakon and hi counsellor also turn walk toward
their escort but aziel linger a littl fear no danger and be
curiou to learn what the men sought
what do you seek captain he ask courteous
a gold armlet that on of us ha lost thei answer
aziel let hi ey wander on the ground and not far awai perceiv the
armlet halfhidden in a tussock of dry grass where inde it had been
place
is thi the ring he ask lift it and hold it toward them
it is and we thank you thei answer advanc to take the
ornament
the next moment befor aziel even guess their purpos the captain
had grip him by either arm and were drag him at full speed
toward their camp understand their treacheri and the great of
hi danger he cri aloud for help then throw himself swiftli to
the ground he set hi feet against a stone that chanc to lie in their
path in such fashion that the sudden weight tore hi right arm from the
group of the man that held him now quick as thought aziel drew the
dagger from hi girdl and still ly upon hi back plung it into
the shoulder of the second man so that he loos him in hi pain next
he sprang to hi feet and leap to on side to escap the rush of
hi captor ran like a deer toward the parti of sakon who had wheel
round at the sound of hi cry
ithob and hi men had turn also and sped toward them but at a
littl distanc thei halt the king shout aloud
i desir to hold thi foreign who is the caus of war between us
hostag for your daughter sake sakon but thi time he ha escap
me well it matter noth for soon my turn will come therefor
if you and he ar wise you will send him back to the sea for thither
alon i promis him safe conduct
then without more word he walk to hi camp the gate of which were
close behind him
princ aziel said sakon as thei went toward the citi it is ill to
speak such word to an honour guest but it cannot be deni that you
bring much troubl on my head twice now you have nearli perish at
the hand of ithob and should that chanc doubtless i must earn the
wrath of israel on your behalf also the citi of zimbo is thi dai
plung into a war that well mai be her last sinc it is becaus you
have grown suddenli dear to her that my daughter ha continu to refus
the suit of ithob and becaus of hi outrag pride at thi refus
that he ha rais up the nation against us princ while you remain
in thi citi there is no hope of peac do not therefor hate me your
servant if i prai of you to leav us while there is yet time
sakon answer aziel i thank you for your open speech and will
pai you back in word as honest as your own gladli would i go for here
noth but sorrow ha befallen me were it not for on thing which to
you mai seem littl but to me and perhap to anoth is all in all i
love your daughter as i have never love a woman befor and as my mind
is to her so is her to mine how then can i go henc when the go
mean that i must part from her for ever
how can you stai here princ when the stai mean that you must
bring her to shame and death and yourself with her sai now ar you
prepar for the sake of thi maiden to abandon the worship of your
father and to becom the servant of el and baalti
you know well that i am not so prepar sakon for noth that the
world could give me would i do thi sin
then princ it is best that you should go for that and no other is
the price you must pai if you would win my daughter elissa should you
seek to do so by other mean i tell you that neither your high rank nor
the power of my rule and friendship nor piti for your youth and her
can save you both from death sinc to forgiv you then would be to
bring down the wrath of it outrag god upon zimbo oh princ for
your own sake and for the sake of her whom both you and i love thu
dearli linger no longer in temptat but turn your back upon it as a
brave man should for so shall my bless follow you to the grave and

certain earn of my own that will be hidden in the baggag moreov
if our departur becom known half the citi would wish to join us

an hour later the phoenician stood in the palac of the god demand
under permit from sakon governor of the citi to be admit into
the presenc of the baalti to whom he desir to sell certain sacr
imag cunningli fashion in gold present it wa announc that he
wa allow to approach and the offic of the templ led him through
guard passag to the privat chamber of the priestess here he
found elissa in a long low hall sweet with scent wood rich with
gold and support by pillar of cedar
she wa seat alon at the far end of thi hall beneath the
windowpl clad in her white robe of offic richli broider
with emblem of the moon her women most of whom were emploi in
needlework though some whisper idli to each other were gather at
the lower end of the hall near to it door
metem salut them as he enter and thei detain him answer hi
greet by request for new and with jest not too refin or by
demand for present of jewel in return for which thei promis him
the bless of the goddess to each he made some apt repli for even
the priestess of baalti could not abash metem but while he bandi
word hi quick ey note on of their number who did not join in
thi plai she wa a spare thinlip woman whom he knew for mesa
the daughter of the dead baalti who had been a rival candid for the
throne of the highpriestess when elissa wa chosen in her place
when he enter the hall mesa wa seat upon a canva stool a littl
apart from the other her chin rest upon her hand stare with an
evil look toward the place where elissa wa enthron nor did her face
grow more gentl at the sight of the cun merchant for she knew well
it wa through hi plot and briberi that she had been oust from her
mother place
a woman to be fear thought metem to himself as shake off the
priestess he pass her upon hi wai up the long chamber present
he had reach the end of it and wa salut the presenc of the
baalti by kneel and touch the carpet with hi brow
rise metem said elissa and set out your busi for the hour of
the sunset prayer is at hand and i cannot talk long with you
so he rose and look at her while he laid out hi store of imag
saw that her face wa sad and that her ey were full of a strang
fear
ladi he said on the second night from now i depart from thi citi
of your and glad shall i be to leav it live therefor i have
brought you these four priceless imag of the most splendid workmanship

if it will pleas you to examin thi preciou imag in the light you
will no longer hesit or think the price too high and bow low he
led the wai behind the throne whither elissa follow him
now thei were stand beneath the windowplac which thei face and
hidden from the gaze of the women by the gild back of the high seat
here he said thrust the parchment into her hand read quickli
and return it to me
she snatch the roll from him and as her ey devour the line her
face fell in and her lip grew pale with anguish
be brave murmur metem for hi heart wa stir to piti it is
best for all that he should go

a shrewd argument and to the point said metem reflect well
i have prepar myself a rockhewn tomb at tyre and do not wish that my
graven sarcophagu of best egyptian alabast should be wast or sold
to some upstart for a song
as assuredli it will be if you do not obei me in thi matter metem
rememberan hour befor moonris at the foot of the pillar of el in
the inner court of the templ
as she spoke metem start for hi quick ear had caught a sound
o queen divin he said in a loud voic as he led the wai to the
front of the throne you ar a hard bargain were there mani such a
poor trader could not make a live ah here is on who know the
valu of such priceless work of art and he point to mesa who with
fold arm and downcast ey stood within five pace of the throne

ladi is fifti golden shekel too much for these imag which have been
bless and sprinkl with the blood of children by the high priest of
baal at sidon
mesa lift her cold ey and look at them i think it too much she
said but it is for the ladi baalti to judg who am i that i should
open my lip in the presenc of the ladi baalti
i have appeal to the oracl and it ha spoken against me said
metem wring hi hand in affect dismai well i abid the result
queen you offer me forti shekel and for forti you shall take them
for the honour of the holi god though in truth i lose ten shekel
by the bargain give your order to the treasur and he will pai me
tomorrow so now farewel and bow till hi forehead touch the
ground he kiss the hem of her robe
elissa bent her head in acknowledg of the salut and as he rose her
ey met hi in them wa written a warn which he could not fail to
understand and although she did not speak her lip seem to shape the
word rememb
ten minut later metem stood in the chamber of aziel
ha she seen the letter and what did she answer ask the princ
spring up almost as he pass the threshold
in the name of all the god of all the nation i prai you not to
speak so loud answer metem when he had close the door and look
suspici about him oh if ever i find myself safe in tyre again
i vow a gift and no mean on to each of them that ha a templ there

her and what think you that thi innoc lamb thi undefil dove of
your threaten me with now death noth less than death if i will
not carri out her foolish wish more she mean the threat and ha
the strength to fulfil it for to the ladi baalti is given power over
the live of men or at the least if she take life none question the
author of the goddess unless i do her will i am a dead man and that
is the reward i get for mix myself up in your mad love affair
hold broke in aziel and tell me man what is her will
her will iswhat do you think to meet you in farewel an hour befor
you leav thi citi well as my throat is at stake by baal it shall
be gratifi if i can find the mean though i tell you that it is
mad and noth els but listen to the stori and he repeat
all that had pass now he ad ar you readi to take the risk

woman dare a heavier
and i am a coward that is why i take it for otherwis i also must
dare a heavier but what of issachar thi meet can scarc be kept
a secret from him
aziel thought awhil and said
go fetch him here so metem went to return present with the levit
to whom without further ado the princ told all hide noth
issachar listen in silenc when both aziel and metem had done
speak he said
at least i thank you princ for be open with me and now without
more word i prai you to abandon thi rash plan which can end onli in
pain and perhap in death
abandon it not princ interrupt metem see that if you do it
will certainli end in my death for the girl is mad and will have her
wai or if she doe not then i must pai the price
have no fear answer aziel smile issachar thi must be done
or

i will not leav the citi it is true that sakon mai thrust me from it
but it shall be as a dead man nai wast no word sinc she desir

glad that you have come for believ me i sought no lover meet
with the princ aziel listen both of you you know that thei have
consecr me highpriestess of baalti against my will now i tell

bear no more from el and baalti i turn to him you worship though
ala littl time is left to me in which to plead for pardon
why is littl time left broke in aziel
becaus my death is veri near me princ for if i live see what a
fate is mine either i must remain highpriestess of baalti and to
her dai by dai bow the knee and month by month make sacrificeof what
think you well to be plain of the blood of maid and children or
perhap should their fear overcom their scrupl i shall be given by
the council as a peaceoff to ithob
i sai that i will bear neither of these burden of blood or shame thei
ar too heavi for me princ so soon as you ar gone i too shall leav
thi citi not in the bodi but in the spirit search for peac
or sleep it wa for thi reason that i sought to speak with you in
farewel sinc in my weak i desir that you should learn the truth
of the caus and manner of my end
now you know all and as for me there is no escap farewel for ever
princ aziel whom i have love and whom i can scarc hope to meet
again even beyond the grave then with a littl despair motion of
her hand she turn to go
stai said aziel hoars we cannot be part thu sinc by your
own act you can dare to leav the world will you not dare to fly thi
place with me
perhap princ she answer with a littl laugh but would you dare
to take me and if so would issachar here suffer it no no go your
own path in life and leav me deathit is the easier wai
in thi matter i am master and not issachar said aziel though it be
true that should it pleas him he can warn the priest of el listen
elissa either you leav thi citi with me or i stai in it with you
you hear me issachar
i hear you said the levit but perchanc befor you throw more
sharp word at my head you will suffer me to speak selfmurd is a
crime yet i honour thi woman who would shed her own blood rather than
the blood of the innoc in sacrific to baal and who refus to be
given in marriag to on she hate who moreov ha found strength
and grace to trampl on her devilworship if so in truth she ha if
therefor she will come with us and we can escap with her why let her
come onli swear to me aziel that you will make no wife of her till
the king your grandsir ha heard thi tale and given judgment on it
that i will swear for him exclaim elissa is it not so aziel
as you will ladi he answer issachar you have my word that until
then she shall be as my sister and no more
i hear and i believ you said issachar ad and now ladi we go
at onc so if you desir to accompani us come
i am readi she repli and the hour is well chosen for i shall not
be miss till dawn
so thei turn and left the templ none stai or hinder them yet
although thei reach the chamber of aziel in safeti their heart
which should have been light were still heavi with the presag of new
sorrow to come
scarc could thei have been heavier inde had thei seen a
whitefac woman creep from the pit of death and follow them stealthili
till thei had pass from the templ into the palac door then turn
and run at full speed toward the colleg of the priest of el
in the chamber of aziel thei found metem
i rejoic to see you back again in safeti sinc it is more than i
thought to do he said while thei enter ad as the blackveil
shape of elissa follow them into the room but who is the third ah
i see the ladi elissa doe the baalti accompani us upon our journei
ye answer aziel shortli
then with her high grace on the on side and the holi issachar on the
other it should not lack for bless sure that evil must be great
from which separ or togeth thei ar unabl to defend us but
ladi if i mai ask it have you bid farewel to your most honour
father
torment me not murmur elissa
inde i did not wish to though you mai rememb that not so long ago
you threaten to silenc me for ever well doubtless your departur
is too hurri for farewel and fortun forese it i have
provid spare mule so my deed ar kinder than my word i go to see
that all is prepar now eat befor you start present i will return
for you and he left the chamber
when he had gone thei gather round the tabl on which stood food
but could touch littl of it for the heart of all three of them
were fill with sad forebod soon thei heard a nois as of peopl
talk excitedli outsid the palac gate
it is metem with the mule said aziel
i hope so answer elissa
again there wa silenc which after a while wa broken by a loud
knock at the door
rise said aziel metem come for us
no no cri elissa it is doom that knock not metem
as the word pass her lip the door wa burst open and through it
pour a mob of arm priest at the head of whom march the shadid
by hi side wa hi daughter mesa in whose pale face the ey burn
like torch in a wind
did i not tell you so she said in a shrill voic point at the
three behold the ladi baalti and her lover and with them that priest
of a fals faith who call down curs upon our citi
you told us inde daughter answer the shadid pardon us if we
were loth to believ that such a thing could be then with a cry of
rage he ad take them
now aziel drew hi sword and sprang in front of elissa to protect her
but befor he could strike a blow it wa seiz from behind and he wa
grip by mani hand gag bound and blindfold then like a man
in a dream he felt himself carri awai through long passag till
at length he reach an airless place where the gag and bandag were
remov
where am i aziel ask
in the vault of the templ answer the priest as thei left the
prison bar it great door behind them
chapter xiii
the sacrileg of aziel
how long he lai in hi dungeon lost in bitter thought and torment by
fear for elissa aziel could not tell for no light came there to
mark the passag of the hour in the tumult of hi mind on terribl
thought grew clear and ever clearer he and elissa had been taken
redhand and must pai the price of their sin against the religi
custom of the citi for the baalti to be found with ani man who wa
not her husband meant death to him and her a doom from which there wa
littl chanc of escap
well to hi own fate he wa almost indiffer but for elissa and
issachar he mourn bitterli truli the levit and metem had been wise
when thei caution him for her sake and hi own to have noth to do
with a priestess of baal but he had not listen hi heart would
not let him listenand now unless thei were save by a miracleor
metemin the ful of their youth and love the live of both of them
were forfeit
worn out with sore fear and vain regret aziel fell at length into a
heavi sleep he wa awaken by the open of the door of hi dungeon
and the entri of priestsgrim silent men who seiz and blindfold
him then thei led him awai up mani stair and along path so steep
that from time to time thei paus to rest till at length he knew by
the sound of voic that he had reach some place where peopl were
assembl here the bandag wa remov from hi ey he step
backward recoil involuntarili at the glare of light that pour
upon him from the set sun whereon utter an exclam those
who stood near seiz and held him present he saw the reason he wa
stand on the brink of a precipic at the back of and domin the
dim and shadowclad citi while far beneath him lai a gloomi rift along
which ran the trade road to the coast
here in thi dizzi spot wa a wide space of rock wall in upon three
side the precipic form the fourth side of it squar in which
seat upon stone that seem to have been set there in semicircl to
serv as judgment chair were gather the head priest and priestess
of el and baalti clad in their sacerdot robe to the right and left
of these stood knot of favour spectat among whom aziel recognis
metem and sakon while at hi side but separ from him by arm
priest were elissa herself wrap in a dark veil and issachar
lastli in front of him a fire flicker upon a littl altar and
behind the altar stood a shrine contain a symbol effigi of
baalti fashion of gold ivori and wood to the shape of a woman with a
hundr breast
see all thi aziel understood that thei three had been brought here
for trial and that the priest and priestess befor him were their
judg inde he rememb that the place had been point out to him
as on where those who had offend against the god were carri for
judgment thenc if found guilti such unfortun were hurl down
the face of the precipic and left a shapeless mass of broken bone to
crumbl on the roadwai at it foot
after a long and solemn paus at a sign from the shadid he who had
been the husband of the dead baalti the veil wa remov from elissa
at onc she turn look at aziel and smile sadli
do you know the fate that wait us the princ ask of issachar in
hebrew
i know and i am readi answer the old levit for sinc my soul is
safe i care littl what these dog mai do to my bodi but oh my son
i weep for you and curs be the hour when first you saw that woman
face
spare to reproach me in my misfortun murmur elissa have i not
enough to bear know that i have brought death upon him i love oh
curs me not but prai that my sin mai be forgiven me
that i will do gladli daughter repli issachar more gentli the
more so that although you seem to be the caus of them these thing
can have happen onli by the will of heaven therefor i wa wrong to
revil you and i ask your pardon
befor she could answer the shadid command silenc at the same moment
the woman mesa step from behind the effigi of the goddess on the
shrine
who ar you and what do you here ask the shadid as though he did
not know her
i am mesa the daughter of her who wa the ladi baalti she answer
and my rank is that of mother of the priestess of baalti i appear
to give true evid against her who is the anoint baalti against
the israelitish stranger name aziel and the priest of the lord of the
jew
lai your hand upon the altar and speak but bewar what you speak
said the shadid
mesa bow her head took the oath of truth by touch the altar with
her finger and began
from the time that she wa appoint i have been suspici of the ladi
baalti
why were you suspici ask the shadid
the wit let her ey wander toward metem then hesit evid
for some reason of her own she did not wish to implic him
i wa suspici she answer becaus of certain word that came
from the lip of the baalti when she had been thrown into the holi
tranc befor the fire of sacrific as is my accustom part i bent
over her to hear and to announc the messag of the god but in place
of the hallow word there issu babbl about thi hebrew stranger
and of a meet to be held with him at on hour befor moonris by
the pillar of el in the courtyard of the templ thereaft for sever
night as wa my duti i hid myself in the pit of offer in the
courtyard and watch last night at an hour befor the moonris the
ladi baalti came disguis by the secret wai and wait at the pillar
where present she wa join by the jew aziel and the levit who
spoke with her
what thei said i could not hear becaus thei were too far from me but
at length thei left the templ and i trace them to the chamber of the
jew aziel in the palac of sakon then shadid i warn you and the
priest and you accompani me and took them now as mother of the
priestess i demand that justic be done upon these wick on
accord to the ancient custom lest the curs of baalti should fall
upon thi citi
when she had finish her evid with a cold stare of triumphant hate
at her rival mesa step to on side
you have heard said the shadid address hi fellowjudg do you
need further testimoni if so it must be brief for the sun sink
nai answer the spokesman for with you we took the three of them
togeth in the chamber of the princ aziel set out the law of thi
matter o judg and let justic be done accord to the strict letter
of the lawjustic without fear or favour
hearken said the shadid last night thi woman elissa the daughter
of sakon be the ladi baalti duli elect met men secretli in
the court of the templ and accompani them or on of them to the
chamber of aziel a princ of israel the guest of sakon whether or no
she wa about to fly with him from the citi which he should have left
last night we cannot tell and it is needless to inquir at least she
wa with him thi howev is sure that thei did not sin in ignor
of our law sinc with my own mouth i warn them both that if the
ladi baalti consort with ani man not her husband duli name by her
accord to her right she must die and her accomplic with her
therefor aziel the israelit we give you to death doom you
present to be hurl from the edg of yonder precipic
i am in your power said the princ proudli and you can murder if
you will becaus forsooth i have offend against some law of baal
but i tell you priest that there ar king in jerusalem and egypt who
will demand my blood at your hand i have noth more to sai except to
beseech you to spare the life of the ladi elissa sinc the fault of the
meet wa not her but mine
princ answer the shadid grave we know your rank and we know
also that your blood will be requir at our hand but we who serv our
god whose vengeanc is so swift and terribl cannot betrai their law
for the fear of ani earthli king yet thu sai thi same law it is
not need that you should die sinc for you there is a wai of escap
that lead to safeti and great honour and she who wa the caus of your
sin is the mistress of it gate elissa holder of the spirit of baalti
upon earth if it be your pleasur to name thi man husband befor us
all then as the spous of baalti he goe free for he whom the baalti
choos cannot refus her gift of love but for so long as she shall
live must rule with her as shadid of el but if you name him not then
as i have said he must die and now speak
it seem that my choic is small said elissa with a faint smile
prai you to pardon me for the deed to save your life princ aziel
accord to the ancient custom and privileg of the baalti i name you
consort and husband
now aziel wa about to answer her when the shadid broke in hurriedli
so be it he said ladi we hear your choic and we accept it as we
must but not yet princ aziel can you take your wife and with her my
place and power your life is safe inde for sinc the baalti be
unw name you as her mate you have done no sin yet she ha sin
and doom await her for against the law she ha chosen as husband on
who worship a strang god and of all crime that is the greatest
therefor either you must take incens and befor us all make offer
to el and baalti upon yonder altar thu renounc your faith and
enter into our or she must die and you your rank have pass
from you with her breath will be expel from the citi
now aziel understood the trap that had been laid for him and saw in it
the handiwork of sakon and metem elissa have flagrantli violat the
religi law and he be the caus of her crime even the author
of the governor of the citi could not prevent hi daughter and hi
guest from be put upon their trial therefor thei had arrang thi
farc for so it would seem to them wherebi both the offend might
escap the legal consequ of their offenc trust doubtless to
accid and the futur to unravel thi web of forc marriag and to
free aziel from a priestli rank which he had not sought it wa onli
necessari that elissa should formal choos him as her husband and
that aziel should go through rite of throw a few grain of incens
upon an altar and the law satisfi thei would be both free and safe
what metem and those who work with him had forgotten wa that thi
offer of incens to baal would be the most deadli of crime in the
ey of ani faith jewon inde which were he alon concern
he would die rather than commit
when the princ heard thi decre and the full terror of the choic
came home to hi mind hi blood turn cold and for a while hi sens
were bewild there wa no escap for him either he must abjur hi
faith at the price of hi own soul or becaus of it the woman whom
he love now befor hi ey must suffer a most horribl and sudden
death it wa hideou to think of and yet how could he do thi sin in
the face of heaven and of these minist of satan
the moment wa at hand a priest held out to him a bowl of incens a
golden bowl he notic idli with handl of green stone fashion in
the like of baalti whose servant he wa ask to declar himself
he aziel of the royal hous of israel a servant of baal and baalti
nai a highpriest of their worship it wa monstrou it might not be
but elissa well she must dieif thi wa not a farc and in truth
thei meant to murder her her life could not be bought at such a price
i cannot do it he gasp with dry lip thrust asid the bowl
now all look astonish for hi refus had not been foreseen
there wa a paus and onc more the woman mesa in her charact of
prosecutrix on behalf of the outrag god appear befor the altar
and said in her cold voic
the jew whom the ladi baalti ha chosen as husband will not do homag
to her god therefor as mother of the priestess and advoc of
baalti i demand that elissa daughter of sakon be put to death and
the throne of baalti be purg of on who ha defil it lest the
swift and terribl vengeanc of the goddess should fall upon thi citi
the shadid motion to her to be silent and address aziel
we prai you to think a while he said befor you give on to death
whose onli sin is that be the highpriestess of our worship she ha
name an unbeliev to fill the throne of el and be her husband out of
piti for her fate we give you time to think
now sakon take advantag of the paus rush forward and throw
hi arm about aziel knee implor him in heartbreak accent
to preserv hi onli child from so horribl a doom he said that did he
refus to save her becaus of hi religi scrupl he would be a dog
and a coward and the scorn of all honest men for ever it wa for love
of him that she had broken the priestli law to violat which wa death
and although he had been warn of her danger yet in hi wicked and
folli he had brought her to thi pass would he then desert her now
but issachar thrust him asid and broke in with fieri word
hearken not to thi man aziel he said who strive to work upon
your weak to the ruin of your soul what to save the life of on
woman whose fair face ha brought so much troubl upon us all would
you deni your lord and becom the thrall of baal and ashtoreth let her
die sinc die she must and keep your own heart pure for be assur
should you do otherwis jehovah whom you renounc will swiftli be
aveng on you and her at the begin i warn you and you would not
listen now aziel i warn you again and woe woe woe to you should
you shut your ear to my messag then lift hi hand toward the
ski he began to prai aloud that aziel might be constant in hi trial
meanwhil metem who had drawn near spoke in a low voic
princ he said i am not chickenheart and there ar so mani
young women in the world that on more or less can scarc matter
still although she threaten to murder me three dai ago i cannot
bear to see thi on come to so dread a death princ do not heed
the howl of that old fanat but rememb that after all you ar
the caus of thi ladi plight and plai the part of a man can you for
the sake of your own scrupl howev worthi or of your own soul even
howev valuabl to yourself doom the fair bodi of a woman who risk
all for you to such an end as that and shudder he nod toward
the gloomi precipic
is there no other wai aziel ask him
none i swear it thei did not wish to kill her except that wildcat
mesa who seek her place but have put her on her public trial if you
persistthei must
thi is on of the few law which cannot be broken for favour or for
gold sinc the peopl who ar alreadi halfmad with fear of ithob
believ that to break it would bring the curs of heaven upon their
citi perhap we might have found some other plan but none of us even
dream that you would refus so small a thing for the sake of a woman
whom you swore you love
a small thing broke in aziel
ye princ a veri small thing rememb thi offer of incens is
but a form to which you ar forc against your willyou can do penanc
for it afterward when i have arrang for both of you to escap the
citi if your god can be angri with you for burn a pinch of dust
to save a woman who at the least ha dare much for you then give me
baal for he is less cruel
now aziel look toward him who held the bowl of incens but elissa
who all thi while had stood silent step forward and spoke
princ aziel she said in a calm and quiet voic i name you husband
to save your life but with all my strength i prai of you do not thi
thing to save mine which is of littl valu and perhap best end
rememb princ aziel that be what you ar a jew thi act of
offer howev small it seem is yet the greatest of sin and on
with which you should not dare to stain your soul for the sake of a
woman who ha chanc to love you to your sorrow be guid therefor
by the true wisdom of issachar and by my humbl prayer make an end of
your doubt and let me die know that we do but part a while sinc
in the gate of death i shall wait for you princ aziel
befor aziel could answer the shadid either becaus hi patienc wa
outworn or becaus he wish to put him to a sharper trial utter a
command be it done to her as she desir
thereon four priest seiz elissa by the wrist and ankl carri
her to the edg of the precipic thei thrust her back till she hung
over it her long hair stream downward and the red light of the
sunset shine upon her upturn ghastli face then thei paus wait
for the signal to let her go the shadid rais hi wand and said
is it your pleasur that thi woman should die or live princ aziel
decid swiftli for my arm is weak and when the wand fall opportun
for choic will have pass from you
now all ey were fix upon the wand and the intens silenc wa onli
broken by sakon cry of despair metem wrung hi hand in grief even
issachar veil hi ey with hi robe to shut out the sight of dread
and the priest who bore the bowl of incens thrust it toward aziel
imploringli
for some second three perhap though to him thei seem an ag the
heart of aziel wa rack and torn in thi terrif contest then he
glanc at the agon face of the doom woman and just as the wand
began to bend hi human love and piti conquer
mai he whom i blasphem forgiv me he murmur ad aloud i will
do sacrific take the incens in hi hand now he cast it into the
flame upon the altar repeat mechan after the shadid by thi
sacrific and homag bodi and soul i give myself to you and worship
you el and baalti the onli true god
the echo of aziel voic di awai and the fume of the incens rose
in a straight dens column upon that quiet air to hi torment mind
it seem as though it smoke took the form of an aveng angel
hold in the hand a sword of flame wherewith to drive awai hi
perjur soul from heaven as our first forefath were driven from
the shine gate of paradis ye and thei were not human those
spectat who in the intens glow of the sunset stood in their still
rank and stare at him with wide and eager ey sure thei were
fiend red with the blood of men fiend gather from the pit to bear
everlast wit to the unpardon sin of hi apostasi
chapter xiv
the martyrdom of issachar
it wa done and from the mouth of the circl of priest and
priestess leapt a shrill and sudden cry of triumph for had not their
god conquer had not thi highplac servant of the hate lord of
israel been caught by the bait of a priestess of baalti and seduc by
her distress to deni and reject him wa not evil onc more triumphant

stricken to the soul woe stamp upon hi face and a stare of horror
in hi ey jew he said i had forgotten you but you also ar on
your trial who dare against the law to hold secret meet with the
ladi baalti for thi sin the punish is death nor as i think

first i address myself to you aziel and to you woman and he
point to elissa who had risen and lean trembl upon her

gaze on mesa priestess you plot thi that you might succe to the
throne of baalti now hear your fate you shall live to sweep the
hut and bear the babe of savag you priest and he point to the
shadid i read your heart you design to murder thi apost whom you
greet as your successor that you mai usurp hi place i show you your

and rais the loud song of triumph to your god when you yourselv ar

dy dai a sheen of spear is it not thei draw near to your heart
you whose dai is done inde citizen of an accurs citi whereof the
veri name shall be forgotten and the nake tower shall becom but a
sourc of wonder to men unborn
and now o priest have said my sai as you bid me i make my
offer upon your altar
then while all stood fear and amaz issachar the levit sprang
forward and seiz the ancient imag of baalti he spat upon it and
dash the priceless consecr thing down upon the altar where it
broke into fragment and wa burn with the fire
my offer is made he said mai he whom i serv accept it now
after the offer come the sacrific son aziel fare you well
for a few moment a silenc of horror and dismai fell upon the assembl
as thei gaze at the shatter and burn fragment of their holi
imag then move by a common impuls with curs and yell of
furi the priest and priestess sprang from their seat and hurl
themselv upon issachar who stood await them with fold arm thei
smote him with their ivori rod thei rent and tore him with their hand
and teeth worri him as dog worri a fox of the hill till at length
the life wa beaten and trampl out of him and he lai dead
thu terribl but yet by such a death of martyrdom as he would have
chosen perish issachar the levit
unarm though he wa aziel had sprung to hi aid but metem and
sakon know that he would but bring about hi own destruct flung
themselv upon him and held him back whilst he wa still struggl
with them the end came and issachar grew still for ever then as the
sun sank and the dark fell aziel strength left him and present
he slip to the ground senseless
thereaft it seem to aziel that he wa plung in an endless and
dread dream and that through it turmoil and shift vision he
could see continu the dread death of issachar and hear hi stern
accent prophesi woe to him who renounc the god of hi forefath
to bow the knee to baal
at length he awok from that horrorhaunt sleep to find himself ly
in a strang chamber it wa night and lamp burn in the chamber
and by their light he saw a man whose face he knew mix a draught in
a glass phial so weak wa he that at first he could not rememb the
man name then by slow degre it came to him
metem he said where am i
the phoenician look up from hi task smile and answer
where you should be princ in your own hous the palac of the
shadid but you must not speak for you have been ill drink thi and
sleep
aziel swallow the draught and wa instantli overcom by slumber when
he awok the sun wa shine brightli through the window place and it
rai fell upon the shrewd kindli face of metem who seat on a stool
watch him hi chin rest in hi hand
tell me all that ha befallen friend said aziel present
sinc and he shudder
sinc you were marri after a new fashion and that bigot but most
honour fool issachar went to hi reward well i will when you
have eaten answer metem as he gave him food first he said after
a while you have lain here for three dai rave in a fever nurs

and invest the citi with a vast armi cut off all suppli and
possibl of escap it is believ that he will try an assault

avoid thi risk it is rumour that the priest and priestess at the
instanc of the council ar discuss the wisdom of give over to
the king the person of the daughter of sakon thi it is said could be
done on the plea that her elect as the ladi baalti wa brought about
with briberi and is therefor void as she wa not chosen by the pure
and unassist will of the goddess
but said aziel she is my wife accord to their religi law how
then can she be given in marriag to anoth
nai princ if she is not the ladi baalti your husbandship fall to
the ground with the rest for you ar not the shadid an offic with
which perchanc you can dispens but all thi priestli juggl mean
littl the truth be that the citi in it terror is readi to throw
heror for the matter of that baalti herself if thei could lai hand
on hera a sop to ithob hope therebi to appeas hi rage the
ladi elissa know her dangerbut here she come to speak for herself
as he spoke the curtain at the end of the chamber were drawn and
through them came elissa clad in her splendid robe of offic and
wear upon her brow the golden crescent of the moon
how goe it with the princ metem she ask in her soft voic
glanc anxious toward the couch which wa halfhidden in the shadow
of the wall
look for yourself ladi answer the phoenician bow befor her
elissa elissa cri aziel rais himself and open hi arm
she saw and heard then with a low cry she ran swiftli to him and wa
wrap in hi embrac thu thei stai a while murmur word of
love and greet
is it your pleasur that i should leav you ask metem present
no then princ i would have you rememb that you ar still veri
weak and should not give wai to violent emot
listen aziel said elissa untwin hi arm from about her neck
there is no time for tender moreov you should show none to on
who in name at least is still the highpriestess of baalti though
in truth she worship her no longer it wa nobl of you inde to offer
incens upon the altar of el that my life might be save but when i
prai you not i spoke from the heart and bitterli bitterli do i
griev that for my sake you should have stain your hand with such
a sin moreov it will avail noth for the doom of the prophet
issachar li upon us and i cannot escap from death neither can you
escap remors and as i think that worst of all desiresth desir
for the dead
can we not still flee the citi ask aziel
metem will tell you that it is imposs dai and night i am watch
and guard ye mesa dog me from door to door also ithob hold
zimbo so firmli in hi net that no sparrow could fly out of it and he
not know and there is wors to tell belov thei purpos to give me
up as a peaceoff to ithob ye even my father is of the plot
for in hi despair he think it hi duti to sacrific hi daughter to
save the town if inde that will suffic to save us
but you ar the baalti and inviol
in such a time the goddess herself would not be held inviol in
zimbo much less her priestess aziel i have discov that thi veri
night thei have laid their plan to seiz me mesa and other have been
chosen for the deed and afterward thei think to offer me as a bribe to
ithob who will take no other price
aziel groan aloud it were better that we should die he said
she nod and answer it were better that i should die but hear
me for i also have a plan and there is still hope though veri littl
perhap as you drew near to zimbo by the coast road you mai have
note three mile or more from the gate of the citi and almost
overhang the path on which you travel a shoulder of the mountain
where the rock is cut awai show the narrow entranc to a cave close
with a gate of bronz
i saw it answer aziel and wa told that there wa the most sacr
buryingplac of the citi
it is the tomb of the highpriestess of baalti went on elissa
and thi dai at sunset i must visit it to lai an offer upon the
shrine of her who wa the baalti befor me enter alon and close
the gate for it is not law that ani on should pass in there with
me now the plan is to lai hand on me as i go back from the tomb
to the palacebut i shall not go back aziel i shall stai in the
tombnai do not fearnot dead i have hidden food and water there
enough for mani dai and there with the depart i shall livetil i
am of their number
but if so how can it help you elissa for thei will break in the
gate of the place and drag you awai
then aziel thei will drag awai a corps and that thei will scarc
care to present to ithob see i have hidden poison in my breast and
here at my girdl hang a dagger ar not the two of them enough to make
an end of on frail life should thei dare to touch me i shall tell
them through the bar that most certainli i shall drink the bane or us
the knife and when thei know it thei will leav me unharm hope to
starv me out or trust to chanc to snare me live
you ar bold murmur aziel in admir but selfmurd is a
sin
it is a sin that i will dare belov as in past dai i would have
dare it for less caus rather than be given aliv into the hand of
ithob for to whoever els i mai be fals to you through life and
death i will be true
now aziel groan in hi doubt and bitter of heart then turn to
metem he ask
have you anyth to sai metem
ye princ two thing answer the phoenician first that the ladi
elissa is rash inde to speak so openli befor me who might carri her
word to the council or the priest
nai metem i am not rash for i know that although you love monei
you will not betrai me
you ar right ladi i shall not for monei would be of littl servic
to me in a citi that is about to be taken by storm also i hate ithob
who threaten my lifea you did also by the wayand will do my best
to keep you from hi clutch now for my second point it is that i can
see littl us in all thi becaus ithob be defraud of you will
attack and then
and then he mai be beaten metem for the citizen will at ani rate
fight for their live and the princ aziel here who is a gener
skill in war will fight also if he ha recov strength
do not fear elissa give me two dai and i will fight to the death
said aziel
at the least she went on thi scheme give us breath time and
who know but that fortun will turn or if it doe not sinc it is
imposs for me to escap from the citi i have no better
no more have i said metem for at length the oldest fox come to hi
last doubl i could escap from thi citi or the princ might escap
or the ladi elissa even might possibl escap disguis but i am sure
that all three of us could not escap see that within the wall we
ar watch and without them the armi of ithob await us oh princ
aziel i should have done well to go as i might have gone when you and
issachar were taken after that mad meet in the templ from which i
never look for anyth but ill but i grow foolish in my old ag and
thought that i should like to see the last of you well so far we ar
all aliv except issachar who although bigot wa still the most
worthi of us but how long we shall remain aliv i cannot sai
now our best chanc is to defeat ithob if we can and afterward in
the confus to fly from zimbo and join our servant to whom i have
sent word to await us in a secret place beyond the first rang of hill
if we cannotwhi then we must go a littl sooner than we expect to
find out who it is that realli shape the destini of men and whether
or no the sun and moon ar the chariot of el and baalti but princ
you turn pale
it is noth said aziel bring me some water the fever still burn
in me
metem went to seek for water while elissa knelt by the couch and
press her lover hand
i dare stai no longer she whisper and aziel i know not how or
when we shall meet again but my heart is heavi for ala i think that
doom draw near me i have brought much sorrow upon you aziel and yet
more upon myself and i have given you noth except that most common
of all thing a woman love
that most perfect of all thing he answer which i am glad to have
live to win
ye but not at the price that you have paid for it i know well what
it must have cost you to cast that incens on the flame and i prai to
your god who ha becom my god to visit the sin of it on my head and
to leav your unharm aziel aziel woman or spirit while i have
life and memori i am your and your onli cleanhand i leav
you and if we mai meet again in thi or in ani other world clean and
faith i shall come to you again glad am i to have live becaus in
my life i have known you and you have sworn you love me glad shall i be
to live again if again i mai know you and hear that oathif not it is
sleep i seek for life without you to me would be a hell you grow weak
and i must go farewel and live or dead forget me not swear that
you will not forget me
i swear it he answer faintli and heaven grant that i mai die for
you not you for me
that is no prayer of mine she whisper and bend kiss him on
the brow for he wa too weak to lift hi lip to her
then she wa gone
chapter xv
elissa take sanctuari
two more hour had pass and in the even light a process of
priestess might be seen advanc slowli toward the holi tomb along
a narrow road of rock cut in the mountain face in front of thi
process wear a black veil over her broider robe walk elissa
with downcast ey and hair unbound in token of grief while behind
her came mesa and other priestess bear in bowl of alabast the
offer to the dead food and wine and lamp of oil and vase fill
with perfum behind these again march the mourner women who sang
a funer dirg and from time to time broke into a wail of simul
grief nor inde wa their woe as hollow as might be thought sinc
from that mountain path thei could see the outpost of the armi of
ithob upon the plain and note with a shudder of fear the spearhead
of hi countless thousand shine in the gorg of the oppos
height it wa not for the dead baalti that thei mourn thi dai but
for the fate which overshadow them and their citi of gold
mai the curs of all the god fall on her mutter on of the
priestess as she toil forward beneath her load of offer
becaus she is beauti and pettish we must be put to the spear or
becom the wive of savag and she point with her chin to elissa
who walk in front lost in her own thought
have patienc answer mesa at her side you know the plantonight
that proud girl and fals priestess shall sleep in the camp of ithob
will he be satisfi with that ask the woman and leav the citi
in peac
thei sai so answer mesa with a laugh though it is strang that
a king should exchang spoil and glori for on roundei thinlimb
girl who love hi rival well let us thank the god that made men
foolish and gave us women wit to profit by their folli if he want
her let him take her for few will be poorer by her loss
you at least will be richer said the other woman and by the crown
of baalti well i do not grudg it you and as for the daughter of
sakon she shall be ithob if i take her to him limb by limb
nai sister that is not the bargain rememb she must be deliv to
him without hurt or blemish otherwis we shall do sacrileg in vain be
silent here is the cave
reach the platform in front of the tomb the process of mourner
rang themselv about it in a semicircl thei stood with their back
to the edg of a cliff that rose sheer for sixti feet or more from the
plain beneath across which but at a littl distanc from the foot
of the precipic ran the road follow by the caravan of merchant
in their journei to and from the coast then a hymn have been sung
invok the bless of the god on the dead priestess elissa as the
baalti unlock the gate of bronz with a golden kei that hung at her
girdl and the bearer of the bowl of offer push them into the
mouth of the tomb whose threshold thei were not allow to pass next
with bow head and hand cross upon her breast elissa enter the
tomb and lock the bronz gate behind her took up two of the bowl
and vanish with them into it gloomi depth
why did she lock the gate ask a priestess of mesa it is not
customari
doubtless becaus it wa her pleasur to do so answer mesa sharpli
though she also wonder why elissa had lock the gate
when an hour wa gone by and elissa had not return her wonder turn
to fear and doubt
call to the ladi baalti she said for her prayer ar long and i
fear lest she should have come to harm
so thei call set heir lip against the bar of the gate till
present elissa hold a lamp in her hand came and stood befor
them
why do you disturb me in the sanctuari she ask
ladi becaus thei set the night watch on the wall answer mesa
and it is time to return to the templ
return then said elissa and leav me in peac what you cannot
mesa nai and shall i tell you why becaus you had plot to deliv
me thi night to those who should lead me as a peaceoff to
ithob and when you come to them emptyhand thei will greet you with
harsh word nai do not troubl to deni it mesa i also have my spi
and know all the plan and therefor i have taken sanctuari in thi
holi place
now mesa press her thin lip togeth and answer
those who dare to lai hand upon the person of the live baalti will
not shrink from seek her in the compani of her dead sister
i know it mesa but the gate ar bar and here i have food and
drink in plenti
gate howev strong can be broken answer the priestess so
ladi do not wait till you ar drag henc like some discov
slave
ay repli elissa with a littl laugh but what if rather than be
thu dishonour i should choos to break anoth gate that of my own
life look traitress here is poison and here is bronz and i swear to
you that should ani lai a hand upon me by on or other of them i will
die befor their ey then if you will bear these bone to ithob
and take hi thank for them now begon and give thi messag to
my father and to all those who have plot with him that sinc thei
cannot bribe ithob with my beauti thei will do well to be men and to
fight him with their sword
then she turn and left them vanish into the dark of the tomb
great inde wa the dismai of the councillor of zimbo and of the
priest who had plot with them when an hour later mesa came not to
deliv elissa into their hand but to repeat to them her threat and
messag in vain did thei appeal to sakon who onli shook hi head and
answer
of thi i am sure that what my daughter ha threaten that she will
certainli do if you forc her to the choic but if you will not believ
me go ask her and satisfi yourselv i know well what she will answer
you and i hold that thi is a judgment upon us who first made her
baalti against her will then threaten her with death becaus of
the princ aziel and now would do sacrileg to her sacr offic and
violenc to herself by tear her from her consecr throne break
her bond of marriag and deliv her to ithob
so the leader of the councillor visit the holi tomb and reason
with elissa through the bar but thei got no comfort from her for she
spoke to them with the phial of poison in her bosom and the nake dagger
in her hand tell them what she had told mesathat thei had best
give up their plot and fight ithob like men see that even if
she surrend herself to him when he grew weari of her the war must
come at last
for a hundr year she ad thi storm ha gather and now it
must burst when it ha roll awai it will be known who is master of
the landth ancient citi of zimbo or ithob king of the tribe
so thei went back as thei had come and next dai at the dawn with a
bold face but heavi heart receiv the messeng of king ithob and
told them their tale the messeng heard and laugh
we ar glad thei answer sinc we who ar not in love with the
daughter of sakon desir war and not peac hold as we do that
the time ha come when you upstart white menyou outlanderswho have
usurp our countri to suck awai it wealth should be set beneath our
heel nor do we think that the task will be difficult for sure we have
littl to fear from a citi of low monei seeker whose councillor cannot
even conquer the will of a singl maid
then in their despair the elder offer other girl to ithob in
marriag as mani as he would and with them a great bribe in monei but
the envoi took their leav sai that noth would avail sinc thei
prefer spearthrust to gold for which thei had littl us and
ithob their king had fix hi fanci on on woman alon
so with a heavi and forebod heart the citi of zimbo prepar itself
to resist attack for as thei had guess when he learn all the rage
of ithob wa great nor would he listen to ani term that thei could
offer save on which thei had no power to grantthat elissa should be
deliv unharm into hi hand council of war were held and to
these so soon as he wa suffici recov from hi sick
the princ aziel wa bidden for he wa known to be a skill captain
therefor though he had been the caus of much of their troubl thei
sought hi aid also should the struggl be prolong thei hope
through him to win israel and perhap egypt to their caus
aziel counsel wa that thei should salli out against the armi of
ithob by night sinc he expect to attack and not to be attack
but to that advic thei would not listen for thei trust to their
wall inde in thi metem support them and when the princ argu
with him he answer
your tactic would be good enough princ if you had at your back the
lion of judah or the wild arab horsemen of the desert but here you
must deal with men of my own breed and we phoenician ar trader not
fight men like rat we fight onli when there is no other chanc for
our live nor do we strike the first blow it is true that there ar
some good soldier in the citi but thei ar foreign mercenari and
as for the rest halfbre and freed slave thei belong as much to
ithob as to sakon and ar not to be trust no no let us stai
behind our wall for thei at least were built when men were honest and
will not betrai us
now in zimbo were three line of defenc first that of a singl wall
built about the hut of the slave upon the plain then that of a doubl
wall of stone with a ditch between thrown round the phoenician citi and
lastli the great fortresstempl and the rocki height abov these
guard as thei were by mani stronghold within whose circl the cattl
were herd as it wa thought could onli be taken with the sword of
hunger
at last the storm burst for on the fifth morn after elissa had
bar herself within the tomb ithob attack the nativ town
utter their wild battlecri ten of thousand of hi savag
warrior arm with great spear and shield of oxhid and wear
crest of plume upon their head charg down upon the outer wall
twice thei were driven back but the work wa in bad repair and too long
to defend so that at the third rush thei flow over it like line of
march ant drive it defend befor them to the inner gate
in thi battl some were kill but the most of the slave threw down
their arm and went over to ithob who spare them togeth with
their wive and children
through all the night that follow the gener of zimbo made readi
for the onslaught which must come everywher within the circuit of the
inner wall troop were station while the doubl southern gatewai
where princ aziel wa the captain in command wa built up with loos
block of stone
a while befor the dawn just as the eastern sky grew grei aziel
watch from hi post abov the gate of the wall heard the fierc
warsong of the tribe swell suddenli from fifti thousand throat and
the measur tramp of their innumer feet then the dai broke and he
saw them advanc in three armi toward the three point chosen for
attack the largest of the armi head by ithob the king direct
it march upon the wall gate of which he wa in command
it wa a wondrou and a fear sight that of these hord of plume
warrior their broad spear flash in the sunris and their fierc
face alight with hereditari hate and the lust of slaughter never had
aziel seen such a spectacl nor could he look upon it without dread
the issu of the war for if thei were savag these foe were brave as
the lion of their own plain and had sworn by the head of their king
to drag down the shelter wall of zimbo with their nake hand or
die to the last man
turn hi head with a sigh of doubt aziel found metem stand at hi
side
have you seen her he ask eagerli
no princ how could i see her at night when she sit in a tomb like a
fox in hi burrow but i have heard her
what did she sai quick man tell me
but littl princ for the tomb is watch and i dare not stai there
long she sent you her greet and would have you know that her heart
will be with you in the battl and her prayer beseech the throne of
heaven for your safeti also she said that she is well though it is
lonesom there in the grave among the bodi of the dead priestess
of baalti whose spirit as she vow haunt her dream revil her
becaus she desecr their sepulchr and ha renounc their god
lonesom inde said aziel with a shudder but tell me metem had
she no other word
ye princ but not of good omen for now as alwai she is sure that
her doom is at hand and that you two will meet no more still she
bade me tell you that all your life long her spirit shall companion you
though it be unseen to receiv you at the last on the threshold of the
underworld
aziel turn hi head awai and said present
if that be so mai it receiv me soon
have no fear princ repli metem with a grim laugh look yonder
and he point to the advanc host
these wall ar strong and we shall beat them back said aziel
nai princ for strong wall do not avail without strong heart to
guard them and those of the womanish citizen of zimbo and their hire
soldier ar white with fear i tell you that the propheci of issachar
the levit made yonder in the templ on the dai of the sacrific and
again in the hour of hi death have taken hold of the peopl and by
eat out their valour fulfil themselv
men hint at them the women whisper them in closet and the veri
children cry them in the street
moreon man last night point to the ski and shriek that in them
he saw that fieri sword of doom of which the prophet spoke hang point
downward abov the citi whereon all present vow thei saw it too
though as i think it wa but a cross of star anoth tell how that
he met the veri spirit of issachar stalk through the marketplac
and that peer into the ey of the wraith as in a mirror he saw a
great flame wrap the templ wall and by the light of it hi own
dead bodi thi man wa the priest who first struck down the holi levit
yonder in the place of judgment
again when the ladi mesa did sacrific last night on behalf of the
baalti who ha fled the child thei offer an infant of six month
stir on the altar after it wa dead and cri with a loud voic that
befor three sun had set it blood should be requir at their hand
that is the stori and if i do not believ it thi at least is true
that the priestess fled fast from the secret chamber of death for
i met them as thei ran shriek in their terror and tear at their
robe but what need is there to dwell on omen true or fals when
coward man the wall and the spear of ithob shine yonder like
all the star of heaven princ i tell you that thi ancient citi is
doom and in it as i fear we must end our wander upon earth
so be it if it must be answer aziel at the least i will die
fight
and i also will die fight princ not becaus i love it but
becaus it is better than be butcher in cold blood by a savag with
a spear oh why did you ever chanc to stumbl upon the ladi elissa
make her prayer to baalti and what evil spirit wa it which fill
your brain with thi sudden mad of love toward each other that
wa the begin of the troubl which but for those ey of her
would have held off long enough to see us safe at tyre though doubtless
soon or late it must have come but see yonder march ithob at the
head of hi guard give me a bow the flight is long but perchanc i
can reach hi black heart with an arrow
save your strength answer aziel the rang is too great and
present you will have enough of shoot and he turn to talk to
the offic of the guard
chapter xvi
the cage of death
an hour later the attack commenc at chosen point of the doubl wall
on of them be the southern gate in front of the advanc column
of savag were driven vast number of slave mani of whom had been
captur or had surrend in the outer town these men were laden
with faggot to fill the ditch rude ladder wherewith to scale the
wall and heavi trunk of tree to be us in breach them for the
most part thei were unarm and protect onli by their burden which
thei held befor them as shield and by the arrow of the warrior of
ithob but these did littl harm to the defend who were hidden
behind the wall wherea the shaft of the garrison rain on them
from abov kill or wound the slave by score who poor creatur
when thei turn to fly were driven onward by the spearpoint of the
savag to be slain in heap like game in a pitfal still some of
them live and run under the shelter of the wall began to breach
it with the rude batter ram and to rais the scale ladder
till death found them or thei were worn out with excit fear and
labour
then the real attack began with fierc yell the threefold column
rush at the wall and began to work the ram and scale the ladder
while the defend abov shower spear and arrow upon them or
crush them with heavi stone or pour upon their head boil pitch
and water heat in great cauldron which stood at hand
time after time thei were driven back with heavi loss and time upon
time fresh hord of them advanc to the onslaught thrice at the
southern gate were the ladder rais and thrice the stormer appear
abov the level of the wall to be hurl back crush and bleed to
the earth beneath
thu the long dai wore on and still the defend held their own
we shall win shout aziel to metem as a fresh ladder wa cast down
with it weight of men to the deathstrewn plain
ye here we shall win becaus we fight answer the phoenician but
elsewher it mai be otherwis inde for a while the attack upon the
south gate slacken
anoth hour pass and present to the left of them rose a wild yell
of triumph and with it a shout of fly to the second wall the foe is
in the foss
metem look and there down the great ditch 300 pace to their left
a flood of savag pour toward them come he said the outer wall
is lost but as he spoke onc more the ladder rose against the gate
and flank tower and onc more aziel sprang to cast them down when
the deed wa done he look behind him to find that he wa cut off and
surround metem and most of hi men inde had gain the inner wall
in safeti while he with twelv onli of hi bravest soldier jew of
hi own follow who had stai to help him to throw back the ladder
were left upon the gatewai tower nor wa escap ani longer possibl
for both the plain without and the foss within were fill with the men
of ithob who advanc also by hundr down the broad cope of the
captur wall
now there is but on thing that we can do said aziel fight brave
till we ar slain
as he spoke a javelin cast from the wall beneath struck him upon the
breastplat and though the bronz turn the iron point it brought him
to hi knee when he found hi feet again he heard a voic call
him by name and look down saw ithob clad in golden har and
surround by hi captain
you cannot escap princ aziel cri the king yield now to my
merci
aziel heard and set an arrow to hi bow loos it at ithob
beneath he wa a strong and skil archer and the heavi shaft pierc
the golden helmet of the king cut hi scalp down to the bone
that is my answer cri aziel as ithob roll upon the ground
beneath the shock of the blow but veri soon the king wa up and cry
hi command from behind the shieldhedg of hi captain
let the princ aziel and the jew with him be taken aliv and brought
to me he shout i will give a great reward in cattl to those who
captur them unharm but if ani do them hurt thei themselv shall be
put to death
the captain bow and issu their order and present aziel and hi
companion saw line of unarm men creep up ladder set at everi
side of the lofti tower again and again thei cast off the ladder till
at length be so few thei could stir them no more becaus of the
weight upon them but must hack at the head of the stormer as thei
appear abov the parapet kill them on by on
in thi fashion thei slew mani but their arm grew weari at last
and ever under the ey of their king the brave savag crept upward
heedless of death till with a shout thei pour over the battlement
and rush at the littl band of jew
now rather than be taken aziel sought to throw himself from the tower
but hi companion held him and thu at last it came about that he wa
seiz and bound
as thei drag him to the stairwai he look across the foss and
saw the mercenari fly from the inner wall although it wa still
unbreach and saw the citizen of zimbo stream by thousand to the
narrow gatewai of the templ fortress
then aziel groan in hi heart and struggl no more for he knew
that the fate of the ancient town wa seal and that the propheci of
issachar would be fulfil
a while later aziel and those with him their hand bound behind their
back were led by hide rope ti about their neck through the armi of
the tribe that jeer and spat upon them as thei pass to a tent of
sewn hide on the plain abov which float the banner of ithob into
thi tent the princ wa thrust alon and there forc upon hi knee
by the soldier who held him befor him upon a couch cover with a
lion skin lai the great shape of ithob while physician wash hi
wound scalp
greet son of israel and pharaoh he said in a mock voic
truli you ar wise thu to do homag to the king of the world
a poor jest answer aziel glanc at those who held him down
true homag is of the heart king ithob
i know it jew and thi also you shall give me when you ar humbler
who taught you the us of the bow you shoot well and he point to
hi bloodstain helm which wa still transfix by the arrow
nai answer aziel i shot but ill for my arm wa weari when
next i draw a string against your breast king ithob i promis you a
straighter shaft
well said answer the king with a laugh but know dog of a
jew that now it is my turn to draw the stringhow i will show you
afterward have thei told you that the citi ha fallen and that my
captain hold the gate while the coward of zimbo ar pen like
sheep within the templ and on the cliffedg height abov thei have
fled hither for safeti but i tell you that thei would be more safe on
yonder plain for i have the kei of their stronghold a certain passag
lead from the palac of the baalti to the templ you know if it i
think ye and if i had not veri soon hunger and thirst would work for
me
well jew i have won and with less troubl than i thought and now i
hold the great citi in hostag to save or to destroi as it shall pleas
me though that arrow of your went near to rob me of my crown of
victori
so be it answer aziel indiffer i have plai my part now
thing must go as fate mai will
ye jew you fought well till thei desert you and the doom of
coward is littl to a brave man but what of the ladi elissa nai i

so have no choic metem bow and went leav the cage aziel upon
the edg of the cliff and the hebrew soldier hang from the spur of
rock
now aziel rous himself from the horror in which hi soul wa sunk and
strove to comfort hi doom comrad prai with him to heaven
slowli as thei prai the hour drew on till at length upon the
opposit cliff he saw men whom he knew to be metem and hi escort
approach the mouth of the tomb and faintli heard him call through the
bar of the gatewai turn himself in hi cage aziel glanc at the
rope and watch the spot of light born from the burn glass of the
crystal creep to it side
now the fatal moment wa at hand and aziel saw a littl wreath of smoke
rise in the still air and bade hi wretch servant close hi ey then
came the end suddenli the taut rope eaten through by the sun fire
flew back and the cage with the soldier in it vanish from hi sight
while from far below rose the sound of a heavi fall and from the tomb
of baalti rang the echo of a woman shriek
