the period in which the stori of the world desir is cast wa a
period when as miss braddon remark of the ag of the plantagenet
anyth might happen recent discoveri mainli by dr schliemann
and mr flinder petri have shown that there realli wa much
intercours between heroic greec the greec of the achaean and the
egypt of the ramessid thi connect rumour of in greek legend
is attest by egyptian relic found in the grave of mycena and by
veri ancient levantin potteri found in contemporari site in egypt
homer himself show us odysseu tell a feign but obvious not
improb tale of an achaean raid on egypt meanwhil the sojourn of
the israelit with their exodu from the land of bondag though not
yet found to be record on the egyptian monument wa probabl part of
the great contemporari stir among the peopl these event which ar
onli known through hebrew text must have worn a veri differ aspect
in the ey of egyptian and of prehistor achaean observ hostil
in faith to the children of israel the topic ha sinc been treat in
fiction by dr eber in hi joshua in such a twilight ag fanci ha
free plai but it is a curiou fact that in thi romanc modern fanci
ha accident coincid with that of ancient greec
most of the novel wa written and the appar ungreek marvel
attribut to helen had been put on paper when a part of furtwngler
recent great lexicon of mytholog appear with the articl on helen
the author of the world desir read it with a feel akin to
amaz their wildest invent about the daughter of the swan it
seem had parallel in the obscur legend of hella there actual
is a tradit preserv by eustathiu that pari beguil helen
by magic put on the aspect of menelau there is a mediaev
parallel in the stori of uther and ygern mother of arthur and
the classic case of zeu and amphitryon is familiar again the
blooddrip rubi of helen in the tale is mention by serviu in
hi commentari on virgil it wa point out to on of the author
by mr mackail but we did not know that the star of the stori wa
actual call the starston in ancient greek fabl the mani voic
of helen ar allud to by homer in the odyssei she wa also name
echo in old tradit to add that she could assum the aspect of
everi man first love wa easi goeth introduc the same qualiti
in the fair witch of hi walpurgi nacht a respect portrait of
meriamun secret counsellor exist in potteri in the british museum
though as it chanc it wa not discov by us until after the
public of thi romanc the laestrygonian of the last battl is
introduc as a prehistor norseman mr gladston we think wa
perhap the first to point out that the laestrygonian of the odyssei
with their home on a fiord in the land of the midnight sun were
probabl deriv from travel tale of the north born with the
amber along the immemori sacr wai the magic of meriamun is in
accord with egyptian idea her resuscit of the dead woman
hataska ha a singular parallel in reginald scot discoveri of
witchcraft 1584 where the spell by the silenc of the night is not
without poetri the gener concept of helen as the world desir
ideal beauti ha been dealt with by m paul de st victor and mr j
a symond for the rest some detail of battl and of wound which
must seem veri ungreek to critic ignor of greek literatur ar

come with us ye whose heart ar set
on thi the present to forget

thei were not and could not be so
the murmur of the fallen creed
like wind among windshaken reed

the fabl of the north and south
shall mingl in a modern mouth
the fanci of the west and east
shall flock and flit about the feast
like dove that cool with wave wing
the banquet of the cyprian king
old shape of song that do not die
shall haunt the hall of memori
and though the bow shall prelud clear
shrill as the song of gunnar spear
there answer sob from lute and lyre
that murmur of the world desir
there live no man but he hath seen
the world desir the fairi queen
none but hath seen her to hi cost
not on but love what he ha lost
none is there but hath heard her sing
divin through hi wander
not on but he ha follow far
the portent of the bleed star
not on but he hath chanc to wake
dream of the star and found the snake
yet through hi dream a wander fire
still still she flit the world desir

the silent isl
across the wide back of the wave beneath the mountain and between
the island a ship came steal from the dark into the dusk and from
the dusk into the dawn the ship had but on mast on broad brown sail
with a star embroid on it in gold her stem and stern were built
high and curv like a bird beak her prow wa paint scarlet and
she wa driven by oar as well as by the western wind
a man stood alon on the halfdeck at the bow a man who look alwai
forward through the night and the twilight and the clear morn he
wa of no great statur but broadbreast and veri wideshould
with mani sign of strength he had blue ey and dark curl lock
fall beneath a red cap such as sailor wear and over a purpl cloak
fasten with a brooch of gold there were thread of silver in hi
curl and hi beard wa fleck with white hi whole heart wa
follow hi ey watch first for the blaze of the island beacon
out of the dark and later for the smoke rise from the faroff
hill but he watch in vain there wa neither light nor smoke on the
grei peak that lai clear against a field of yellow sky
there wa no smoke no fire no sound of voic nor cry of bird the
isl wa deadli still
as thei near the coast and neither heard nor saw a sign of life the
man face fell the glad went out of hi ey hi featur grew
older with anxieti and doubt and with long for tide of hi home
no man ever love hi home more than he for thi wa odysseu the
son of laerteswhom some call ulyssesreturn from hi unsung second
wander the whole world ha heard the tale of hi first voyag how
he wa toss for ten year on the sea after the take of troi how
he reach home at last alon and disguis as a beggar how he found
violenc in hi hous how he slew hi foe in hi own hall and won hi
wife again but even in hi own countri he wa not permit to rest
for there wa a curs upon him and a labour to be accomplish he must
wander again till he reach the land of men who had never tast salt
nor ever heard of the salt sea there he must sacrific to the seagod
and then at last set hi face homeward now he had endur that
curs he had fulfil the propheci he had anger by misadventur
the goddess who wa hi friend and after adventur that have never yet
been told he had arriv within a bowshot of ithaca
he came from strang countri from the gate of the sun and from white
rock from the pass place of soul and the peopl of dream
but he found hi own isl more still and strang by far the realm of
dream wa not so dumb the gate of the sun were not so still as the
shore of the familiar island beneath the rise dawn
thi stori whereof the substanc wa set out long ago by rei the
instruct egyptian priest tell what he found there and the tale of
the last adventur of odysseu laert son
the ship ran on and won the wellknown haven shelter from wind by two
headland of sheer cliff there she sail straight in till the leav
of the broad oliv tree at the head of the inlet were tangl in her
cordag then the wander without onc look back or sai on
word of farewel to hi crew caught a bough of the oliv tree with hi
hand and swung himself ashor here he kneel and kiss the earth
and cover hi head within hi cloak he prai that he might find
hi hous at peac hi wife dear and true and hi son worthi of him
but not on word of hi prayer wa to be grant the god give and
take but on the earth the god cannot restor
when he rose from hi knee he glanc back across the water but there
wa now no ship in the haven nor ani sign of a sail upon the sea
and still the land wa silent not even the wild bird cri a welcom
the sun wa hardli up men were scarc awak the wander said to
himself and he set a stout heart to the steep path lead up the hill
over the wold and across the ridg of rock that divid the two mass
of the island up he climb purpos as of old to seek the hous of
hi faith servant the swineherd and learn from him the tide of
hi home on the brow of a hill he stop to rest and look down on
the hous of the servant but the strong oak palisad wa broken no
smoke came from the hole in the thatch roof and as he approach
the dog did not run bark as sheepdog do at the stranger the
veri path to the hous wa overgrown and dumb with grass even a dog
keen ear could scarc have heard a footstep
the door of the swineherd hut wa open but all wa dark within the
spider had woven a glitter web across the empti black a sign
that for mani dai no man had enter then the wander shout twice
and thrice but the onli answer wa an echo from the hill he went in
hope to find food or perhap a spark of fire shelter under the dry
leav but all wa vacant and cold as death
the wander came forth into the warm sunlight set hi face to the hill
again and went on hi wai to the citi of ithaca
he saw the sea from the hilltop glitter as of yore but there were
no brown sail of fisherboat on the sea all the land that should now
have wave with the white corn wa green with tangl weed halfwai
down the rug path wa a grove of alder and the basin into which
water flow from the old fountain of the nymph but no maiden were
there with their pitcher the basin wa broken and green with mould
the water slip through the crevic and hurri to the sea there
were no offer of wayfar rag and pebbl by the well and on
the altar of the nymph the flame had long been cold the veri ash
were cover with grass and a branch of ivi had hidden the stone of
sacrific
on the wander press with a heavi heart now the high roof of hi own
hall and the wide fenc court were within hi sight and he hurri
forward to know the worst
too soon he saw that the roof were smokeless and all the court wa
deep in weed where the altar of zeu had stood in the midst of the
court there wa now no altar but a great grei mound not of earth but
of white dust mix with black over thi mound the coars grass prick
up scantili like thin hair on a leprosi
then the wander shudder for out of the grei mound peep the
char black bone of the dead he drew near and lo the whole heap
wa of noth els than the ash of men and women death had been busi
here here mani peopl had perish of a pestil thei had all been
consum on on funer fire while thei who laid them there must have
fled for there wa no sign of live man the door gape open and
none enter and none came forth the hous wa dead like the peopl
who had dwelt in it
then the wander paus where onc the old hound argo had welcom him
and had di in that welcom there unwelcom he stood lean on
hi staff then a sudden rai of the sun fell on someth that glitter
in the heap and he touch it with the end of the staff that he had in
hi hand it slid jingl from the heap it wa the bone of a forearm
and that which glitter on it wa a halfmolten ring of gold on the
gold lambda these charact were engrav
ikmalio mepoiesen
icmalio made me
at the sight of the armlet the wander fell on the earth grovel
among the ash of the pyre for he knew the gold ring which he had
brought from ephyr long ago for a gift to hi wife penelop thi
wa the bracelet of the bride of hi youth and here a mockeri and a
terror were those kind arm in which he had lain then hi strength wa
shaken with sob and hi hand clutch blindli befor him and he
gather dust and cast it upon hi head till the dark lock were defil
with the ash of hi dearest and he long to die
there he lai bite hi hand for sorrow and for wrath against god and
fate there he lai while the sun in the heaven smote him and he knew
it not while the wind of the sunset stir in hi hair and he stir
not he could not even shed on tear for thi wa the sorest of all the
sorrow that he had known on the wave of the sea or on land among the
war of men
the sun fell and the wai were darken slowli the eastern sky grew
silver with the moon a nightfowl voic wa heard from afar it drew
nearer then through the shadow of the pyre the black wing flutter
into the light and the carrion bird fix it talon and it beak on
the wander neck then he move at length toss up an arm and
caught the bird of dark by the neck and broke it and dash it on
the ground hi sick heart wa mad with the littl sudden pain and he
clutch for the knife in hi girdl that he might slai himself but
he wa unarm at last he rose mutter and stood in the moonlight
like a lion in some ruinou palac of forgotten king he wa faint with
hunger and weak with long lament as he step within hi own door
there he paus on that high threshold of stone where onc he had sat in
the disguis of a beggar that veri threshold whenc on anoth dai he
had shot the shaft of doom among the wooer of hi wife and the waster
of hi home but now hi wife wa dead all hi voyag wa end here
and all hi war were vain in the white light the hous of hi kingship
wa no more than the ghost of a home dread unfamiliar empti
of warmth and love and light the tabl were fallen here and there
throughout the long hall moulder bone from the funer feast and
shatter cup and dish lai in on confus the ivori chair were
broken and on the wall the moonbeam glisten now and again from
point of steel and blade of bronz though mani sword were dark with
rust
but there in it gleam case lai on thing friendli and familiar
there lai the bow of eurytu the bow for which great heracl had slain
hi own host in hi hall the dread bow that no mortal man but the
wander could bend he wa never us to carri thi preciou bow with
him on shipboard when he went to the war but treasur it at home
the memori of a dear friend foulli slain so now when the voic of
dog and slave and child and wife were mute there yet came out of
the still a word of welcom to the wander for thi bow which
had thrill in the grip of a god and had scatter the shaft of the
vengeanc of heracl wa wondrous made and magic a spirit dwelt
within it which knew of thing to come which bode the battl from
afar and therefor alwai befor the slai of men the bow sang
strang through the night the voic of it wa thin and shrill a
ring and a sing of the string and of the bow while the wander
stood and look on hi weapon hark the bow began to thrill the sound
wa faint at first a thin note but as he listen the voic of it in
that silenc grew clear strong angri and triumphant in hi ear and
to hi heart it seem that the wordless chant rang thu
keen and low
doth the arrow sing
the song of the bow
the sound of the string
the shaft cry shrill
let us forth again
let us feed our fill
on the flesh of men
greedi and fleet
do we fly from far
like the bird that meet
for the feast of war
till the air of fight
with our wing be stir
as it whirr from the flight
of the raven bird
like the flake that drift
on the snowwind breath
mani and swift
and wing for death
greedi and fleet
do we speed from far
like the bird that meet
on the bridg of war
fleet as ghost that wail
when the dart strike true
do the swift shaft hail
till thei drink warm dew
keen and low
do the grei shaft sing
the song of the bow
the sound of the string
thi wa the messag of death and thi wa the first sound that had
broken the still of hi home
at the welcom of thi music which spoke to hi heartthi music he had
heard so mani a timeth wander knew that there wa war at hand
he knew that the wing of hi arrow should be swift to fly and their
beak of bronz were whet to drink the blood of men he put out hi
hand and took the bow and tri the string and it answer shrill as
the song of the swallow
then at length when he heard the bowstr twang to hi touch the
fountain of hi sorrow were unseal tear came like soft rain on a
frozen land and the wander wept
when he had hi fill of weep he rose for hunger drove himhung
that is of all thing the most shameless be stronger far than
sorrow or love or ani other desir the wander found hi wai through
the narrow door behind the dai and stumbl now and again over fallen
fragment of the home which he himself had built he went to the inner
secret storehous even he could scarc find the door for sapl
of tree had grown up about it yet he found it at last within the holi
well the water wa yet babbl and shine in the moonlight over the
silver sand and here too there wa store of moulder grain for
the hous had been abundantli rich when the great plagu fell upon the
peopl while he wa far awai so he found food to satisfi hi hunger
after a sort and next he gather togeth out of hi treasurechest
the beauti golden armour of unhappi pari son of priam the fals
love of fair helen these arm had been taken at the sack of troi and
had lain long in the treasuri of menelau in sparta but on a dai he had
given them to odysseu the dearest of all hi guest the wander
clad himself in thi golden gear and took the sword call euryaluss
gift a bronz blade with a silver hilt and a sheath of ivori which
a stranger had given him in a faroff land alreadi the love of life
had come back to him now that he had eaten and drunk and had heard the
song of the bow the slayer of men he live yet and hope live in him
though hi hous wa desol and hi wed wife wa dead and there
wa none to give him tide of hi on child telemachu even so
life beat strong in hi heart and hi hand would keep hi head if ani
searobb had come to the citi of ithaca and made their home there
like hawk in the forsaken nest of an eagl of the sea so he clad
himself in hi armour and chose out two spear from a stand of lanc
and clean them and girt about hi shoulder a quiver full of shaft
and took in hand hi great bow the bow of eurytu which no other man
could bend
then he went forth from the ruin hous into the moonlight went
forth for the last time for never again did the high roof echo to the
footstep of it lord long ha the grass grown over it and the seawind
wail
ii
the vision of the world desir
the fragrant night wa clear and still the silenc scarc broken by the
lap of the wave as the wander went down from hi fallen home to
the citi on the sea walk warili and watch for ani light from the
hous of the peopl but thei were all as dark as hi own mani of them
roofless and ruin for after the plagu an earthquak had smitten
the citi there were gape chasm in the road here and there and
through rift in the wall of the hous the moon shone strang
make rag shadow at last the wander reach the templ of
athen the goddess of war but the roof had fallen in the pillar were
overset and the scent of wild thyme grow in the broken pavement rose
where he walk yet as he stood by the door of the fane where he had
burn so mani a sacrific at length he spi a light blaze from the
window of a great chapel by the sea it wa the templ of aphrodit
the queen of love and from the open door a sweet savour of incens and
a golden blaze rush forth till thei were lost in the silver of the
moonshin and in the salt smell of the sea thither the wander went
slowli for hi limb were swai with weari and he wa half in
a dream yet he hid himself cunningli in the shadow of a long avenu
of myrtl for he guess that searobb were keep revel in
the forsaken shrine but he heard no sound of sing and no tread of
danc feet within the fane of the goddess of love the sacr plot
of the goddess and her chapel were silent he hearken awhil and
watch till at last he took courag drew near the door and enter
the holi place but in the tall bronz brazier there were no faggot
burn nor were there torch light in the hand of the golden men
and maid the imag that stand within the fane of aphrodit yet if
he did not dream nor take moonlight for fire the templ wa bath in
shower of gold by a splendour of flame none might see it centr nor
it fountain it sprang neither from the altar nor the statu of the
goddess but wa everywher immin a glori not of thi world a fire
untend and unlit and the paint wall with the stori of the love
of men and god and the carven pillar and the beam and the roof of
green were bright with flame fire
at thi the wander wa afraid know that an immort wa at hand
for the come and go of the god were attend as he had seen
by thi wonder light of unearthli fire so he bow hi head and hid
hi face as he sat by the altar in the holiest of the holi shrine and
with hi right hand he grasp the horn of the altar as he sat there
perchanc he woke and perchanc he slept howev it wa it seem
to him that soon there came a murmur and a whisper of the myrtl
leav and laurel and a sound in the top of the pine and then hi
face wa fan by a breath more cold than the wind that wake the dawn
at the touch of thi breath the wander shudder and the hair on hi
flesh stood up so cold wa the strang wind
there wa silenc and he heard a voic and he knew that it wa the
voic of no mortal but of a goddess for the speech of goddess wa
not strang in hi ear he knew the clarion cry of athen the queen of
wisdom and of war and the win word of circ the daughter of the
sun and the sweet song of calypso voic as she wove with her golden
shuttl at the loom but now the word came sweeter than the moan of
dove more soft than sleep so came the golden voic whether he woke
or whether he dream
odysseu thou knowest me not nor am i thy ladi nor hast thou ever
been my servant where is she the queen of the air athen and why
comest thou here as a suppliant at the knee of the daughter of
dion
he answer noth but he bow hi head in deeper sorrow
the voic spake again
behold thy hous is desol thy hearth is cold the wild hare breed
on thy hearthston and the nightbird roost beneath thy rooftre
thou hast neither child nor wife nor nativ land and she hath
forsaken theethi ladi athen mani a time didst thou sacrific to her
the thigh of kine and sheep but didst thou ever give so much as a
pair of dove to me hath she left thee as the dawn forsook tithonu
becaus there ar now thread of silver in the dark of thy hair is
the wise goddess fickl as a nymph of the woodland or the well doth
she love a man onli for the bloom of hi youth nai i know not but
thi i know that on thee odysseu old ag will soon be hasteningold
ag that is pitiless and ruinou and weari and weakag that cometh
on all men and that is hate to the god therefor odysseu er
yet it be too late i would bow even thee to my will and hold thee for
my thrall for i am she who conquer all thing live god and beast
and men and hast thou thought that thou onli shalt escap aphrodit
thou that hast never love as i would have men love thou that hast
never obei me for an hour nor ever known the joi and the sorrow that
ar mine to give for thou didst but ensur the caress of circ the
daughter of the sun and thou wert aweari in the arm of calypso and
the sea king daughter came never to her long as for her who is
dead thy dear wife penelop thou didst love her with a loyal heart
but never with a heart of fire nai she wa but thy companion thy
housewif and the mother of thy child she wa mingl with all the
memori of the land thou lovest and so thou gavest her a littl love
but she is dead and thy child too is no more and thy veri countri is
as the ash of a forsaken hearth where onc wa a camp of men what
have all thy war and wander won for thee all thy labour and all
the adventur thou hast achiev for what didst thou seek among
the live and the dead thou soughtest that which all men seekthou
soughtest the world desir thei find it not nor hast thou found
it odysseu and thy friend ar dead thy land is dead noth live
but hope but the life that li befor thee is new without a remnant
of the old dai except for the bitter of long and remembr
out of thi new life and the unborn hour wilt thou not give what
never befor thou gavest on hour to me to be my servant
the voic as it seem grew softer and came nearer till the wander
heard it whisper in hi veri ear and with the voic came a divin
fragranc the breath of her who spoke seem to touch hi neck the
immort tress of the goddess were mingl with the dark curl of hi
hair
the voic spake again
nai odysseu didst thou not onc give me on littl hour fear not
for thou shalt not see me at thi time but lift thy head and look on
the world desir
then the wander lift hi head and he saw as it were in a pictur
or in a mirror of bronz the vision of a girl she wa more than mortal
tall and though still in the first flower of youth and almost a child
in year she seem fair as a goddess and so beauti that aphrodit
herself mai perchanc have envi thi loveli she wa slim and
graciou as a young shoot of a palm tree and her ey were fearless and
innoc as a child on her head she bore a shine urn of bronz
as if she were bring water from the well and behind her wa the
foliag of a plane tree then the wander knew her and saw her onc
again as he had seen her when in hi boyhood he had journei to the
court of her father king tyndareu for as he enter sparta and came
down the hill taygetu and as hi chariot wheel flash through the
ford of eurota he had met her there on her wai from the river there
in hi youth hi ey had gaze on the loveli of helen and hi
heart had been fill with the desir of the fairest of women and like
all the princ of achaia he had sought her hand in marriag but helen
wa given to anoth man to menelau atreuss son of an evil hous
that the knee of mani might be loosen in death and that there might
be a song in the ear of men in after time
as he beheld the vision of young helen the wander too grew young
again but as he gaze with the ey and love with the first love of a
boi she melt like a mist and out of the mist came anoth vision he
saw himself disguis as a beggar beaten and bruis yet seat in a
long hall bright with gold while a woman bath hi feet and anoint
hi head with oil and the face of the woman wa the face of the maiden
and even more beauti but sad with grief and with an ancient shame
then he rememb how onc he had stolen into troi town from the camp
of the achan and how he had crept in a beggar rag within the hous
of priam to spy upon the trojan and how helen the fairest of women
had bath him and anoint him with oil and suffer him to go in
peac all for the memori of the love that wa between them of old as
he gaze that pictur fade and melt in the mist and again he bow
hi head and kneel by the golden altar of the goddess cry
where beneath the sunlight dwell the golden helen for now he had
onli on desir to look on helen again befor he di
then the voic of the goddess seem to whisper in hi ear
did i not sai truth odysseu wast not thou my servant for on hour
and did not love save thee in the citi of the trojan on that night when
even wisdom wa of no avail
he answer yea o queen
behold then said the voic i would again have merci and be kind to
thee for if i aid thee not thou hast no more life left among men home
and kindr and nativ land thou hast none and but for me thou
must devour thine own heart and be lone till thou diest therefor
i breath into thy heart a sweet forget of everi sorrow and i
breath love into thee for her who wa thy first love in the begin
of thy dai
for helen is live yet upon the earth and i will send thee on the
quest of helen and thou shalt again take joi in war and wander thou
shalt find her in a strang land among a strang peopl in a strife of
god and men and the wisest and bravest of man shall sleep at last in
the arm of the fairest of women but learn thi odysseu thou must
set thy heart on no other woman but onli on helen
and i give thee a sign to know her by in a land of magic and among
women that deal in sorceri
on the breast of helen a jewel shine a great starston the gift i
gave her on her weddingnight when she wa bride to menelau from that
stone fall red drop like blood and thei drip on her vestment and
there vanish and do not stain it
by the star of love shalt thou know her by the star shalt thou swear
to her and if thou knowest not the portent of the bleed star or if
thou breakest that oath never in thi life odysseu shalt thou win
the golden helen and thine own death shall come from the waterth
swiftest deaththat the sai of the dead prophet mai be fulfil
yet first shalt thou lie in the arm of the golden helen
the wander answer
queen how mai thi be for i am alon on a seagirt isl and i have no
ship and no companion to speed me over the great gulf of the sea
then the voic answer
fear not the god can bring to pass even greater thing than these go
from my hous and lie down to sleep in my holi ground within the nois
of the wash of the wave there sleep and take thy rest thy strength
shall come back to thee and befor the set of the new sun thou
shalt be sail on the path to the world desir but first drink from
the chalic on my altar fare thee well
the voic di into silenc like the dy of music the wander awok
and lift hi head but the light had fade and the templ wa grei in
the first wake of the dawn yet there on the altar where no cup had
been stood a deep chalic of gold full of red wine to the brim thi
the wander lift and draineda draught of nepenth the magic cup
that put troubl out of mind as he drank a wave of sweet hope went
over hi heart and buri far below it the sorrow of remembr and
the troubl of the past and the long desir for love that were no
more
with a light step he went forth like a younger man take the two
spear in hi hand and the bow upon hi back and he lai down beneath a
great rock that look toward the deep and there he slept
iii
the slai of the sidonian
morn broke in the east a new dai dawn upon the silent sea and on
the world of light and sound the sunris top the hill at last and
fell upon the golden raiment of the wander where he slept make it
blaze like live fire as the sun touch him the prow of a black ship
stole swiftli round the headland for the oarsmen drove her well with
the oar ani man who saw her would have known her to be a vessel of
the merchant of sidonth most cun peopl and the greediest of
gainfor on her prow were two bighead shape of dwarf with gape
mouth and knot limb such god as those were worship by the
sidonian she wa now return from albion an isl beyond the pillar
of heracl and the gate of the great sea where much store of tin is
found and she had rich merchandis on board on the halfdeck besid
the steersman wa the captain a thin keenei sailor who look
shoreward and saw the sun blaze on the golden armour of the wander
thei were so far off that he could not see clearli what it wa that
glitter yellow but all that glitter yellow wa a lure for him
and gold drew him on as iron draw the hand of hero so he bade the
helmsman steer straight in for the sea wa deep below the rock and
there thei all saw a man ly asleep in golden armour thei whisper
togeth laugh silent and then sprang ashor take with them
a rope of twist oxhid a hawser of the ship and a strong cabl of
byblu the papyru plant on these rope thei cast a loop and a run
knot a lasso for throw so that thei might captur the man in safeti
from a distanc with these in their hand thei crept up the cliff for
their purpos wa to noos the man in golden armour and drag him on
board their vessel and carri him to the mouth of the river of egypt
and there sell him for a slave to the king for the sidonian who were
greedi of everyth love noth better than to catch free men and
women who might be purchas by mere forc or guil and then be sold
again for gold and silver and cattl mani king son had thu been
captur by them and had seen the dai of slaveri in babylon or tyre
or egyptian thebe and had di sadli far from the argiv land
so the sidonian went round warili and creep in silenc over the
short grass and thyme toward the wander were soon as near to him as
a child could throw a stone like shepherd who seek to net a sleep
lion thei came cunningli yet not so cunningli but that the wander
heard them through hi dream and turn and sat up look around him
half awak but as he woke the noos fell about hi neck and over hi
arm and thei drew it hard and threw him on hi back befor thei could
touch him he wa on hi feet again cry hi warcri terribl the cry
that shook the tower of ilium and he rush upon them clutch at
hi sword hilt the men who were nearest him and had hold of the rope
let it fall from their hand and fled but the other swung behind him
and drag with all their forc if hi arm had been free so that he
might draw hi sword it would have gone ill with them mani as thei
were for the sidonian have no stomach for sword blade but hi arm
were held in the noos yet thei did not easili master him but as
those who had fled came back and thei all laid hand on the rope
togeth thei overpow him by main forc at last and haul him
step by step till he stumbl on a rock and fell then thei rush at
him and threw themselv all upon hi bodi and bound him with rope in
cun sailor knot but the booti wa dearli won and thei did not all
return aliv for he crush on man with hi knee till the breath left
him and the thigh of anoth he broke with a blow of hi foot
but at last hi strength wa spent and thei had him like a bird in a
snare so by might and main thei bore him to their ship and threw him
down on the foredeck of the vessel there thei mock him though thei
were half afraid for even now he wa terribl then thei haul up the
sail again and sat down to the oar the wind blew fair for the mouth
of the nile and the slavemarket of egypt the wind wa fair and their
heart were light for thei had been among the first of their peopl to
deal with the wild tribe of the island albion and had brought tin and
gold for african sea shell and rude glass bead from egypt and now
near the veri end of their adventur thei had caught a man whose armour
and whose bodi were worth a king ransom it wa a lucki voyag thei
said and the wind wa fair
the rest of the journei wa long but in wellknown water thei pass
by cephalonia and the rock of gilip and wood zacynthu and sam
and of all those isl he wa the lord whom thei were now sell
into captiv but he lai still breath heavili and he stir but
oncethat wa when thei near zacynthu then he strain hi head
round with a mighti strain and he saw the sun go down upon the height
of rocki ithaca for that last time of all
so the swift ship ran along the coast slip by forgotten town past
the echinean isl and the elian shore and pleasant eiren thei sped
and it wa dusk er thei reach dorion deep night had fallen when thei
ran by pylo and the light of the fire in the hall of pisistratu the
son of nestor the old shone out across the sandi seacoast and the
sea but when thei were come near malea the southernmost point of land
where two sea meet there the storm snatch them and drove them ever
southward beyond crete toward the mouth of the nile thei scud
long befor the stormwind lose their reckon and rush by
island templ that show like ghost through the mist and past haven
which thei could not win on thei fled and the men would gladli have
lighten the ship by cast the cargo overboard but the captain
watch the hatch with a sword and two bronzetip spear in hi
hand he would sink or swim with the ship he would go down with hi
treasur or reach sidon the citi of flower and build a white hous
among the palm by the water of bostren and never try the sea again
so he swore and he would not let them cast the wander overboard as
thei desir becaus he had brought bad luck he shall bring a good
price in tani cri the captain and at last the storm abat and
the sidonian took heart and were glad like men escap from death so
thei sacrif and pour forth wine befor the dwarfgod on the prow
of their vessel and burn incens on their littl altar in their
mirth and to mock the wander thei hung hi sword and hi shield
against the mast and hi quiver and hi bow thei arrai in the fashion
of a trophi and thei mock him believ that he knew no word of
their speech but he knew it well as he knew the speech of the peopl
of egypt for he had seen the citi of mani men and had spoken with
captain and mercenari from mani a land in the great war
the sidonian howev jibe and spoke freeli befor him sai how
thei were bound for the rich citi of tani on the bank of the river
of egypt and how the captain wa mind to pai hi toll to pharaoh
with the bodi and the armour of the wander that he might seem the
comeli and a gift more fit for a king the sailor slacken hi
bond a littl and brought him dri meat and wine and he at till hi
strength return to him then he entreat them by sign to loosen the
cord that bound hi leg for inde hi limb were dead through the
strength of the bond and hi armour wa eat into hi flesh at hi
prayer thei took some piti of him and loosen hi bond again and he
lai upon hi back move hi leg to and fro till hi strength came
back
so thei sail southward ever through smooth water and past the
island that lie like waterlili in the midland sea mani a strang
sight thei saw vessel bear slave whose sigh might be heard
abov the sigh of wind and wateryoung men and maiden of ionia and
achaia stolen by slavetrad into bondag now thei would touch at
the white haven of a peac citi and again thei would watch a smoke
on the sealin all dai rise black into the heaven but by nightfal
the smoke would chang to a great roar fire from the beacon of a
beleagu island town the fire would blaze on the mast of the ship
of the besieg and show bloodr on their sail and glitter on the
gild shield that line the bulwark of their ship but the sidonian
sped on till on night thei anchor off a littl isl that li over
against the mouth of the nile beneath thi isl thei moor the ship
and slept most of them ashor
then the wander began to plot a wai to escap though the enterpris
seem desper enough he wa ly in the dark of the hold
sleepless and sore with hi bond while hi guard watch under an
awn in the moonlight on the deck thei dream so littl of hi
escap that thei visit him onli by watch now and again and
as it chanc the man whose turn it wa to see that all wa well fell
asleep mani a thought went through the prison mind and now it
seem to him that the vision of the goddess wa onli a vision of sleep
which came as thei said through the fals gate of ivori and not
through the gate of horn so he wa to live in slaveri after all a
king no longer but a captiv toil in the egyptian mine of sinai
or a soldier at a palac gate till he di thu he brood till out
of the still came a thin faint thrill sound from the bow that
hung against the mast over hi head the bow that he never thought
to string again there wa a nois of a sing of the bow and of the
string and the wordless song shape itself thu in the heart of the
wander
lo the hour is nigh
and the time to smite
when the foe shall fly
from the arrow flight
let the bronz bite deep
let the warbird fly
upon them that sleep
and ar ripe to die
shrill and low
do the grei shaft sing
the song of the bow
the sound of the string
then the low music di into the silenc and the wander knew that the
next sun would not set on the dai of slaveri and that hi reveng wa
near hi bond would be no barrier to hi vengeanc thei would break
like burnt tow he knew in the fire of hi anger long sinc in hi
old dai of wander calypso hi love had taught him in the summer
leisur of her seagirt isl how to tie the knot that no man could
unti and to undo all the knot that men can bind he rememb thi
lesson in the night when the bow sang of war so he thought no more
of sleep but cunningli and swiftli unknot all the cord and
the bond which bound him to a bar of iron in the hold he might have
escap now perhap if he had stolen on deck without wake the
guard dive thenc and swam under water toward the island where he
might have hidden himself in the bush but he desir reveng no less
than freedom and had set hi heart on come in a ship of hi own and
with all the great treasur of the sidonian befor the egyptian king
with thi in hi mind he did not throw off the cord but let them
lie on hi arm and leg and about hi bodi as if thei were still ti
fast but he fought against sleep lest in move when he woke he might
reveal the trick and be bound again so he lai and wait and in the
morn the sailor came on board and mock at him again in hi mirth
on of the men took a dish of meat and of lentil and set it a littl
out of the wander reach as he lai bound and said in the phoenician
tongu
mighti lord art thou some god of javan for so the sidonian call
the achan and wilt thou deign to tast our sacrific is not the
savour sweet in the nostril of my lord why will he not put forth hi
hand to touch our offer
then the heart of odysseu mutter sullenli within him in wrath at the
insol of the man but he constrain himself and smile and said
wilt thou not bring the mess a veri littl nearer my friend that i
mai smell the sweet incens of the sacrific
thei were amaz when thei heard him speak in their own tongu but he
who held the dish brought it nearer like a man that anger a dog now
offer the meat and now take it awai
so soon as the man wa within reach the wander sprang out the
loosen bond fall at hi feet and smote the sailor beneath the ear
with hi clench fist the blow wa so fierc for all hi anger went
into it that it crush the bone and drove the man against the mast of
the ship so that the strong mast shook where he fell there he lai hi
feet kick the floor of the hold in hi deathpain
then the wander snatch from the mast hi bow and hi short sword
slung the quiver about hi shoulder and ran on to the rais deck
of the prow
the bulwark of the deck were high and the vessel wa narrow and
befor the sailor could stir for amaz the wander had taken hi
stand behind the littl altar and the dwarfgod here he stood with
an arrow on the string and the bow drawn to hi ear look about him
terribl
now panic and dread came on the sidonian when thei saw him stand
thu and on of the sailor cri
ala what god have we taken and bound our ship mai not contain him
sure he is resef mikal the god of the bow whom thei of javan call
apollo nai let us land him on the isl and come not to blow with him
but entreat hi merci lest he rous the wave and the wind against
us
but the captain of the ship of the sidonian cri
not so ye knave have at him for he is no god but a mortal man and
hi armour is worth mani a yoke of oxen
then he bade some of them climb the deck at the further end of the
ship and throw spear at him thenc and he call other to bring up
on of the long spear and charg him with that now these were huge
pike that were wield by five or six men at onc and no armour could
withstand them thei were us in the fight to drive back boarder and
to ward off attack on ship which were beach on shore in the sieg
of town
the men whom the captain appoint littl like the task for the long
spear were laid on tressel along the bulwark and to reach them and
unship them it wa need to come within rang of the bow but the
sailor on the further deck threw all their spear at onc while five
men leap on the deck where the wander stood he loos the bowstr
and the shaft sped on it wai again he drew and loos and now two of
them had fallen beneath hi arrow and on wa struck by a chanc blow
from a spear thrown from the further deck and the other two leap back
into the hold
then the wander shout from the high deck of the prow in the
speech of the sidonian
ye dog ye have sail on your latest seafar and never again shall
ye bring the hour of slaveri on ani man
so he cri and the sailor gather togeth in the hold and took
counsel how thei should deal with him but meanwhil the bow wa silent
and of those on the hinder deck who were cast spear on drop and
the other quickli fled to their fellow below for on the deck thei had
no cover
the sun wa now well risen and shone on the wander golden mail as
he stood alon on the deck with hi bow drawn the sun shone there
wa silenc the ship swung to her anchor and still he wait look
down hi arrow point at the level of the deck to shoot at the first
head which rose abov the plank suddenli there wa a rush of men on
to the further deck and certain of them tore the shield that line
the bulwark from their pin and threw them down to those who were
below while other cast a shower of spear at the wander some of the
spear he avoid other leap back from hi mail other stood fast
in the altar and in the bodi of the dwarfgod while he answer with
an arrow that did not miss it aim but hi ey were alwai watch
most keenli the hatch nearest him whenc a gangwai ran down to the
lower part of the ship where the oarsmen sat for onli thenc could
thei make a rush on him as he watch and drew an arrow from the quiver
on hi shoulder he felt as it were a shadow between him and the deck
he glanc up quickli and there on the yard abov hi head a man who
had climb the mast from behind wa creep down to drop on him from
abov then the wander snatch a short spear and cast it at the man
the spear sped quicker than a thought and pin hi two hand to the
yard so that he hung there helpless shriek to hi friend but the
arrow of the wander kept rain on the men who stood on the further
deck and present some of them too leap down in terror cry
that he wa a god and not a man while other threw themselv into the
sea and swam for the island
then the wander himself wait no longer see them all amaz but
he drew hi sword and leap down among them with a cry like a seaeagl
swoop on seamew in the crevic of a rock to right and left he smote
with the short sword make a havoc and spare none for the sword
raven in hi hand and some fell over the bench and oar but such
of the sailor as could flee rush up the gangwai into the further
deck and thenc sprang overboard while those who had not the luck to
flee fell where thei stood and scarc struck a blow onli the captain
of the ship know that all wa lost turn and threw a spear in the
wander face but he watch the flash of the bronz and stoop
hi head so that the spear struck onli the golden helm and pierc it
through but scarc graze hi head now the wander sprang on the
sidonian captain and smote him with the flat of hi sword so that he
fell senseless on the deck and then he bound him hand and foot with
cord as he himself had been bound and made him fast to the iron bar in
the hold next he gather up the dead in hi mighti arm and set them
against the bulwark of the foredeckharvest the fruit of war
abov the deck the man who had crept along the yard wa hang by hi
two hand which the spear had pin togeth to the yard
art thou there friend cri the wander mock him hast thou
chosen to stai with me rather than go with thy friend or seek new
servic nai then as thou art so staunch abid there and keep a good
lookout for the river mouth and the market where thou shalt sell me for
a great price so he spoke but the man wa alreadi dead of pain and
fear then the wander unbuckl hi golden armour which clang upon
the deck and drew fresh water from the hold to cleans himself for
he wa stain like a lion that ha devour an ox next with a golden
comb he comb hi long dark curl and he gather hi arrow out of
the bodi of the dead and out of the thwart and the side of the
ship cleans them and laid them back in the quiver when all thi
wa end he put on hi armour again but strong as he wa he could not
tear the spear from the helm without break the gold so he snap
the shaft and put on the helmet with the point of the javelin still
fix firm in the crest as fate would have it so and thi wa the
begin of hi sorrow next he at meat and bread and drank wine
and pour forth some of the wine befor hi god lastli he drag
up the heavi stone with which the ship wa moor a stone heavier far
thei sai than two other men could lift he took the tiller in hi hand
the steadi north wind the etesian wind kept blow in the sail and
he steer straight southward for the mouth of the nile
iv
the bloodr sea
a hard fight it had been and a long and the wander wa weari he took
the tiller of the ship in hi hand and steer for the south and
for the noondai sun which wa now at hi highest in the heaven but
suddenli the bright light of the sky wa darken and the air wa fill
with the rush and the murmur and the winnow of innumer wing
it wa as if all the bird that have their home and seek their food in
the great salt marsh of cayster had risen from the south and had flown
over sea in on hour for the heaven wa darken with their flight and
loud with the call of crane and the whistl cry of the wild duck
so dark wa the thick mass of fly fowl that a flight of swan shone
snowi against the black cloud of their wing at the view of them the
wander caught hi bow eagerli into hi hand and set an arrow on the
string and take a care aim at the white wedg of bird he shot a
wild swan through the breast as it swept high over the mast then
with all the speed of it rush the wild white swan flash down like
lightn into the sea behind the ship the wander watch it fall
when lo the water where the dead swan fell splash up as red as blood
and all afoam the long silver wing and snowi plumag float on the
surfac fleck with bloodr stain and the wander marvel as he
bent over the bulwark and gaze steadili upon the sea then he saw that
the wide sea round the ship wa cover as far as the ey could reach
as it were with a bloodr scum hither and thither the red stain wa
toss like foam yet beneath where the deep wave divid the wander
saw that the stream of the sea were grei and green below the crimson
dye as he watch he saw too that the red froth wa drift alwai
onward from the south and from the mouth of the river of egypt for
behind the wake of the ship it wa most red of all though he had not
mark it when the battl rage but in front the colour grew thin as
if the stain that the river wash down wa all but spent in hi heart
the wander thought as ani man must have deem that on the bank of
the river of egypt there had been some battl of great nation and
that the war god had rage furious wherefor the holi river as it ran
forth stain all the sacr sea where war wa there wa hi home no
other home had he now and all the more eagerli he steer right on to
see what the god would send him the flight of bird wa over and past
it wa two hour after noon the light wa high in the heaven when
as he gaze anoth shadow fell on him for the sun in midheaven grew
small and red as blood slowli a mist rose up over it from the south
a mist that wa thin but as black as night beyond to the southward
there wa a bank of cloud like a mountain wall steep and polish
and black tip along the rag crest with fire and open ever
and again with flash of intoler splendour while the base were
scrawl over with lightn like a written scroll never had the
wander in all hi voyag on the sea and on the great river oceanu
that girdl the earth and sever the dead from the live mennev
had he beheld such a dark present he came as it were within the
jaw of it dark as a wolf mouth so dark that he might not see the
corps on the deck nor the mast nor the dead man swing from the
yard nor the captain of the phoenician who groan aloud below prai
to hi god but in the wake of the ship there wa on break of clear
blue sky on the horizon in which the littl isl where he had slain the
sidonian might be discern far off as bright and white as ivori
now though he knew it not the gate of hi own world were close
behind the wander for ever to the north whenc he came lai the
clear sky and the sunni cape and isl and the airi mountain of the
argiv land white with the templ of familiar god but in face of
him to the south whither he went wa a cloud of dark and a land
of dark itself there were thing to befal more marvel than ar
told in ani tale there wa to be a war of the peopl and of the god
the true god and the fals and there he should find the last embrac
of love the fals love and the true
forebod somewhat of the peril that lai in front the wander wa
tempt to shift hi cours and sail back to the sunlight but he wa
on that had never turn hi hand from the plough nor hi foot from
the path and he thought that now hi path wa foreordain so he
lash the tiller with a rope and grope hi wai with hi hand along
the deck till he reach the altar of the dwarfgod where the ember
of the sacrific still were glow faintli then with hi sword he cut
some spearshaft and broken arrow into white chip and with them he
fill a littl brazier and take the seed of fire from the altar
set light to it from beneath present the wood blaze up through the
noondai night and the fire flicker and flare on the face of the
dead men that lai about the deck roll to larboard and to starboard
as the vessel lurch and the flame shone red on the golden armour of
the wander
of all hi voyag thi wa the strangest seafar he cruis alon
with a compani of the dead deep into a dark without measur or
bound to a land that might not be descri strang gust of sudden
wind blew him hither and thither the breez would rise in a moment
from ani quarter and die as suddenli as it rose and anoth wind
would chase it over the chop sea he knew not if he sail south or
north he knew not how time pass for there wa no sight of the sun
it wa night without a dawn yet hi heart wa glad as if he had been a
boi again for the old sorrow were forgotten so potent wa the draught
of the chalic of the goddess and so keen wa the delight of battl
endur my heart he cri as often he had cri befor a wors
thing than thi thou hast endur and he caught up a lyre of the dead
sidonian and sang
though the light of the sun be hidden
though hi race be run
though we sail in a sea forbidden
to the golden sun
though we wander alon unknow
oh heart of mine
the path of the strang seago
of the bloodr brine
yet endur we shall not be shaken
by thing wors than these
we have scape when our friend were taken
on the unsail sea
wors death have we face and fled from
in the cyclop den
when the floor of hi cave ran red from
the blood of men
wors grief have we known undaunt
wors fate have fled
when the isl that our long love haunt
lai wast and dead
so he wa chant when he descri faint and far off a red glow cast
up along the dark like sunset on the sky of the underworld for
thi light he steer and soon he saw two tall pillar of flame blaze
besid each other with a narrow space of night between them he helm
the ship toward these and when he came near them thei were like two
mighti mountain of wood burn far into heaven and each wa lofti
as the pyre that blaze over men slain in some red war and each pile
roar and flare abov a steep crag of smooth black basalt and between
the burn mound of fire lai the flamefleck water of a haven
the ship near the haven and the wander saw move like firefli
through the night the lantern in the prow of boat and from on
of the boat a sailor hail him in the speech of the peopl of egypt
ask him if he desir a pilot
yea he shout the boat drew near and the pilot came aboard a
torch in hi hand but when hi ey fell on the dead men in the ship
and the horror hang from the yard and the captain bound to the
iron bar and abov all on the golden armour of the hero and on the
spearpoint fast in hi helm and on hi terribl face he shrank
back in dread as if the god osiri himself in the ship of death had
reach the harbour but the wander bade him have no fear tell him
that he came with much wealth and with a great gift for the pharaoh the
pilot therefor pluck up heart and took the helm and between the
two great hill of blaze fire the vessel glide into the smooth water
of the river of egypt the flame glitter on the wander mail as
he stood by the mast and chant the song of the bow
then by the counsel of the pilot the vessel wa steer up the river
toward the templ of heracl in tani where there is a sanctuari for
stranger and where no man mai harm them but first the dead sidonian
were cast overboard into the great river for the dead bodi of men ar
an abomin to the egyptian and as each bodi struck the water the
wander saw a hate sight for the face of the river wa lash into
foam by the sudden leap and rush of huge fourfoot fish or so
the wander deem them the sound of the heavi plung of the great
waterbeast as thei dart forth on the prei smite at each other
with their tail and the gnash of their jaw when thei bit too
eagerli and onli harm the air and the leap of a greedi sharp snout
from the wave even befor the dead man cast from the ship had quit
touch the waterthes thing were horribl to see and hear through
the black and by the firelight a river of death it seem haunt
by the horror that ar said to prei upon the soul and bodi of the
dead for the first time the heart of the wander di within him
at the horror of the dark and of thi dread river and of the
waterbeast that dwelt within it then he rememb how the bird had
fled in terror from thi place and he bethought him of the bloodr
sea
when the dead men were all cast overboard and the river wa onc more
still the wander spoke sick at heart and inquir of the pilot why
the sea had run so red and whether war wa in the land and why there
wa night over all that countri the fellow answer that there wa
no war but peac yet the land wa strang plagu with frog and
locust and lice in all their coast the sacr river sihor run red
for three whole dai and now at last for thi the third dai dark
over all the world but as to the caus of these curs the pilot knew
noth be a plain man onli the stori went among the peopl that
the god were angri with khem as thei call egypt which inde wa
easi to see for those thing could come onli from the god but why
thei were anger the pilot knew not still it wa commonli thought that
the divin hathor the goddess of love wa wroth becaus of the worship
given in tani to on thei call the strang hathor a goddess or a
woman of wonder beauti whose templ wa in tani concern her
the pilot said that mani year ago some thirti year she had
first appear in the countri come none knew whenc and had been
worship in tani and had again depart as mysteri as she came
but now she had onc more chosen to appear visibl to men strang
and to dwell in her templ and the men who beheld her could do noth
but worship her for her beauti whether she wa a mortal woman or a
goddess the pilot did not know onli he thought that she who dwell
in atarhechi hathor of khem the queen of love wa angri with the
strang hathor and had sent the dark and the plagu to punish them
who worship her the peopl of the seaboard also murmur that it
would be well to prai the strang hathor to depart out of their coast
if she were a goddess and if she were a woman to stone her with stone
but the peopl of tani vow that thei would rather die on and
all than do aught but ador the incompar beauti of their strang
goddess other again held that two wizard leader of certain slave
of a strang race wander from the desert settl in tani whom
thei call the apura caus all these sorrow by artmag as if
forsooth said the pilot those barbarian slave were more power than
all the priest of egypt but for hi part the pilot knew noth onli
that if the divin hathor were angri with the peopl of tani it wa
hard that she must plagu all the land of khem
so the pilot murmur and hi tale wa none of the shortest but even
as he spoke the dark grew less dark and the cloud lift a littl
so that the shore of the river might be seen in a green light like the
light of hade and present the night wa roll up like a veil and
it wa live noondai in the land of khem then all the nois of
life broke forth in on moment the kine low the wind swai the
featheri palm the fish splash in the stream men cry to each
other from the river bank and the voic of multitud of peopl in
everi red templ prais ra their great god whose dwell is the
sun the wander too prais hi own god and gave thank to apollo
and to helio hyperion and to aphrodit and in the end the pilot
brought the ship to the quai of a great citi and there a crew of
oarsmen wa hire and thei sped rejoic in the sunlight through a
canal dug by the hand of men to tani and the sanctuari of heracl
the safeti of stranger there the ship wa moor there the wander
rest have a good welcom from the shaven priest of the templ
v
meriamun the queen
strang new fli fast it wa not long befor the pharaoh who then
wa with hi court in tani the newli rebuild citi heard how there
had come to khem a man like a god wear golden armour and cruis
alon in a ship of the dead in these year the white barbarian of the
sea and of the isl were wont to land in egypt to ravag the field
carri women captiv and fly again in their ship but not on of them
had dare to sail in the armour of the aquaiusha as the egyptian
name the achan right up the river to the citi of pharaoh the king
therefor wa amaz at the stori and when he heard that the stranger
had taken sanctuari in the templ of heracl he sent instantli for hi
chief counsellor thi wa hi master builder who bore a high titl in
the land an ancient priest name rei he had serv through the long
reign of the king father the divin rames the second and he wa
belov both of meneptah and of meriamun hi queen him the king charg
to visit the sanctuari and bring the stranger befor him so rei call
for hi mule and rode down to the templ of heracl beyond the wall
when rei came thither a priest went befor him and led him to the
chamber where the warrior chanc to be eat the lili bread of the
land and drink the wine of the delta he rose as rei enter and he
wa still clad in hi golden armour for as yet he had not ani chang
of raiment besid him on a bronz tripod lai hi helmet the achan
helmet with it two horn and with the bronz spearpoint still fast in
the gold
the ey of rei the priest fell on the helmet and he gaze so strang
at it that he scarc heard the wander salut at length he
answer courteous but alwai hi ey wander back to the broken
spearpoint
is thi thine my son he ask take it in hi hand while hi
voic trembl
it is my own said the wander though the spearpoint in it
wa lent me of late in return for arrow not a few and certain

it wa men of sidon who labour and di for all that cargo said the
wander thei voyag far for it and toil hard but thei lost it
in an hour for thei were not content with what thei had but made me a

then he led the old man to the treasurechamb of the templ which
wa rich in the offer of mani travel gold and turquois and
frankincens from sinai and punt great horn of carv ivori from the

then the old man led the wander out and bade the priest make readi
a chariot for him and so thei went through tani to the court of
meneptah behind them follow the priest carri gift that the
wander had chosen from the treasur of the sidonian and the
miser captain of the sidonian wa drag along after them bound

pass on to the hall of audienc where between the great pillar
sat pharaoh on hi golden throne besid him at hi right hand wa
meriamun the beauti queen who look at the priest with weari
ey as if at a matter in which she had no concern thei came in
and beat the earth with their brow befor the king first came the
offic lead the captain of the sidonian for a gift to pharaoh
and the king smile gracious and accept the slave
then came other bear the cup of gold fashion like the head of
lion and ram and the sword with pictur of war and hunt echo

and pharaoh he had silk too embroid in gold and needlework of
sidonian women and all these the queen meriamun touch to show her
accept of them and smile gracious and wearili but the covet
sidonian groan when he saw hi wealth depart from him the gain

bade them lead the wander in befor hi presenc and he came
unhelmet in all hi splendour the goodliest man that had ever been
seen in khem he wa of no great height but veri great of girth and of
strength unmatch and with the face of on who had seen what few have
seen and live the beauti of youth wa gone from him but hi face had
the comeli of a warrior tri on sea and land the ey were of a
valour invinc and no woman could see him but she long to be hi
love
as he enter murmur of amaz pass over all the compani and all
ey were fix on him save onli the weari and wander ey of the
listless meriamun but when she chanc to lift her face and gaze on
him thei who watch the look of king and queen saw her turn grei as
the dead and clutch with her hand at her side pharaoh himself saw
thi though he wa not quick to mark what pass and he ask her if
anyth ail her but she answer
nai onli methink the air is sick with heat and perfum greet thou
thi stranger but beneath her robe her finger were fret all the
while at the golden fring of her throne
welcom thou wander cri pharaoh in a deep and heavi voic
welcom by what name art thou name and where dwell thy peopl and
what is thy nativ land
bow low befor pharaoh the wander answer with a feign tale
that hi name wa eperitu of alyba the son of apheida the rest of
the stori and how he had been taken by the sidonian and how he had
smitten them on the sea he told as he had told it to rei and he
displai hi helmet with the spearpoint fast in it but when she saw
thi meriamun rose to her feet as if she would be gone and then fell
back into her seat even paler than befor
the queen help the queen she faint cri rei the priest whose
ey had never left her face on of her ladi a beauti woman
ran to her knelt befor her and chafe her hand till she came to
herself and sat up with angri ey
let be she said and let the slave who tend the incens be beaten
on the feet nai i will remain here i will not to my chamber let be
and her ladi drew back afraid
then pharaoh bade men lead the sidonian out and slai him in the
marketplac for hi treacheri but the man whose name wa kurri threw
himself at the feet of the wander prai for hi life the wander
wa merci when the rage of battl wa over and hi blood wa cool
a boon o pharaoh meneptah he cri spare me thi man he save
my own life when the crew would have cast me overboard let me pai my
debt
let him be spare as thou wilt have it so spoke pharaoh but
reveng dog the feet of foolish merci and mani debt ar paid er all
is done
thu it chanc that kurri wa given to meriamun to be her jewel
and to work for her in gold and silver to the wander wa allot a
chamber in the royal palac for the pharaoh trust that he would be
a leader of hi guard and took great pleasur in hi beauti and hi
strength
as he left the hall of audienc with rei the queen meriamun lift her
ey again and look on him long and her ivori face flush rosi
like the ivori that the sidonian dye red for the trap of the
hors of king but the wander mark both the sudden fear and the
blush of meriamun and beauti as she wa he like it ill and hi
heart forebod evil when he wa alon with rei therefor he spoke to
him of thi and prai the old man to tell him if he could guess at all
the mean of the queen
for to me he said it wa as if the ladi knew my face and even
as if she fear it but i never saw her like in all my wander
beauti she is and yetbut it is ill speak in their own land of
king and queen
at first when the wander spoke thu rei put it by smile but the
wander see that he wa troubl and rememb how he had prai
him to pluck the spearpoint from hi helmet press him hard with
question thu partli out of weari and partli for love of him
and also becaus a secret had long been burn in hi heart the old
man took the wander into hi own room in the palac and there he told
him all the stori of meriamun the queen
vi
the stori of meriamun
rei the priest of amen the master builder began hi stori unwillingli
enough and slowli but soon he took pleasur in tell it as old men
do and in share the burden of a secret
the queen is fair he said thou hast seen no fairer in all thy
voyag
she is fair inde answer the wander i prai that she be
wellmat and happi on her throne
that is what i will tell thee of though my life mai be the price of
the tale said rei but a lighter heart is well worth an old man
cheap risk and thou mayst help me and her when thou knowest all
pharaoh meneptah her lord the king is the son of the divin rames
the everliv pharaoh child of the sun who dwelleth in osiri
thou meanest that he is dead ask the wander
he dwelleth with osiri said the priest and the queen meriamun wa
hi daughter by anoth bed
a brother wed a sister exclaim the wander
it is the custom of our royal hous from the dai of the timeless
king the children of horu an old custom
the wai of hi host ar good in the ey of a stranger said the
wander courteous
it is an old custom and a sacr said rei but women the
custommak ar often custombreak and of all women meriamun
least love to be obedi even to the dead and yet she ha obei
and it came about thu her brother meneptahwho now is pharaohth
princ of kush while her divin father live had mani halfsist but
meriamun wa the fairest of them all she is beauti a moonchild the
common peopl call her and wise and she doe not know the face of
fear and thu it chanc that she learn what even our royal women
rare learn all the ancient secret wisdom of thi ancient land except
queen taia of old no woman ha known what meriamun know what i have
taught heri and anoth counsellor
he paus here and hi mind seem to turn on unhappi thing
i have taught her from childhood he went onwould that i had been
her onli familiarand after her divin father and mother she love me
more than ani for she love few but of all whom she did not love she
love her royal brother least he is slow of speech and she is quick
she is fearless and he ha no heart for war from her childhood she
scorn him mock him and master him with her tongu she even
learn to excel him in the chariot racestherefor it wa that the
king hi father made him but a gener of the foot soldiersand in
guess riddl which our peopl love she delight to conquer him
the victori wa easi enough for the divin princ is heavywit but
meriamun wa never tire of gird at him plainli even as a littl
child she grudg that he should come to wield the scourg of power and
wear the doubl crown while she should live in idl and hunger for
command
it is strang then that of all hi sister if on must be queen he
should have chosen her said the wander
strang and it happen strang the princ father the divin
rames had will the marriag the princ hate it no less than
meriamun but the will of a father is the will of the god in on sport
the divin princ excel in the game of piec an old game in khem
it is no pastim for women but even at thi meriamun wa determin
to master her brother she bade me carv her a new set of the piec
fashion with the head of cat and shape from the hard wood of
azebi i carv them with my own hand and night by night she plai
with me who have some name for skill at the sport

on sunset it chanc that her brother came in from hunt the lion in
the libyan hill he wa in an evil humour for he had found no lion
and he caus the huntsmen to be stretch out and beaten with rod
then he call for wine and drank deep at the palac gate and the
deeper he drank the darker grew hi humour
he wa go to hi own court in the palac strike with a whip at
hi hound when he chanc to turn and see meriamun she wa sit
where those three great palmtre ar and wa plai at piec with
me in the cool of the dai there she sat in the shadow clad in white

black of her hair there she sat as beauti as the hathor the
queen of love or as the ladi isi when she plai at piec in amenti
with the ancient king nai an old man mai sai it there never wa
but on woman more fair than meriamun if a woman she be she whom our
peopl call the strang hathor
now the wander bethought him of the tale of the pilot but he said
noth and rei went on
the princ saw her and hi anger sought for someth new to break
itself on up he came and i rose befor him and bow myself but
meriamun fell indol back in her chair of ivori and with a sweep of
her slim hand she disord the piec and bade her wait woman

the princ went scowl awai and meriamun laugh but i foresaw

he too lift the symbol of hi royalti from hi head and gave it to me
there wa a differ between the circlet the coronet of meriamun wa
crown with on crest snake that of the divin princ wa crown

thi time the game went differ for the princ could scarc make
a prison of a singl piec save of on templ and two bowmen onli and
present it wa the turn of meriamun to cry pharaoh is dead and
to sweep the piec from the board thi time meneptah did not boast but
scowl while i set the board and the scribe wrote down the game upon
hi tablet now it wa the princ turn to take the field
in the name of holi thoth he cri to whom i vow great gift of

and he plai and so well that for a while the game went against her
but at length when thei had struggl long and meriamun had lost the
most of her piec a light came into her face as though she had found
what she sought and while the princ call for wine and drank she lai
back in her chair and look upon the board then she move so shrewdli
and upon so deep a plan that he fell into the trap that she had laid for

uraeu on her brow she mock him bid him come do homag to her
who had won hi crown and stretch forth her small hand for him to
kiss it and so wondrou wa her beauti that the divin princ of kush

grave and dark face were about me and i wore that thou knowest for a
girdl and the tomb of the rock wherein we dwelt were score with the
write of a dead tongueth tongu of that land whenc our father
came we were all chang yet the same and onc more the woman and i
struggl for the masteri and though i seem to conquer yet a sea of
fire came over me and i woke and i slept again
then confus wa pile upon confus nor can my memori hold all
that came to pass for thi game plai itself afresh in land and
live and tongu without number onli the last bout and the winner
were not reveal to me
and in my dream i cri aloud to the protect god to escap out of
the dream and i sought for light that i might see whenc these thing
were then as in a vision the past open up it gate it seem that
upon a time thousand thousand ag agon i and thi man of my dream
had arisen from nothing and look in each other ey and love
with a love unspeak and vow a vow that shall endur from time to
time and world to world for we were not mortal then but partook of the
natur of the god be more fair and great than ani of human kind
and our happi wa the happi of heaven but in our great joi we
hearken to the voic of the that thou knowest of that thing rei
with which against thy counsel i have but late dealt the kiss of
our love awaken that which slept the fire of our love warm that
which wa acold we defi the holi god worship them not but
rather each the other for we knew that as the god we were etern and
the god were anger against us and drew us up into their presenc and
while we trembl thei spake as with a voic
ye twain who ar on life each complet each becaus with your
kiss ye have waken that which slept and with the fire of your love
have warm that which wa acold becaus ye have forgotten them that
gave you life and love and joi hearken to your doom
from two be ye made three and through all time strive ye to be
twain again pass from thi holi place down to the hell of earth and
though ye be immort put on the garment of mortal pass on from
life to life live and love and hate and seem to die have acquaint
with everi lot and in your blind forget be on and be
equal work each other woe accord to the law of earth and for your
love sake sin and be shame perish and rearis appear to conquer
and be conquer pursu your threefold destini and at the word of
fate the unalt circl meet and the veil of blind fall from
your ey and as a scroll your folli is unrol and the hid purpos
of your sorrow is accomplish and onc more ye ar twain and on
then as we trembl cling each to each again the great voic
spoke
ye twain who ar onelet that to which ye have hearken divid you
and enfold you be ye three
and as the voic spoke i wa torn with agoni and strength went out of
me and there by him i love stood the woman of my dream crown with
everi glori and adorn with the star and we were three and between
him and me yet enfold him and me writh that thing thou wottest
of and he whom i love turn to look upon the fair woman wonder
and she smile and stretch out her arm toward him as on who would
take that which is her own and rei in that hour though it wa but in
a dream i knew the mortal pain of jealousi and awok trembl
and now read thou thi vision rei thou who art learn in the
interpret of dream and in the wai of sleep
oh ladi i made answer thi thing is too high for me i cannot
interpret it but where thou art there mai i be to help thee
i know thy love she said but in thy word is littl light
sosolet it pass it wa but a dream and if inde it came from the
under world why it wa from no help god but rather from set the
tormentor or from pasht the terribl who throw the creep shadow
of her doom upon the mirror of my sleep for that which is decre will
sure come to pass i am blown like the dust by the breath of fate now
to rest upon the templ loftiest top now to be trodden underfoot of
slave and now to be swallow by the bitter deep and in season thenc
roll forth again i love not thi lord of mine who shall be pharaoh
and never mai he come whom i shall love ti well that i love him
not for to love is to be a slave when the heart is cold then the hand
is strong and i am fain to be the queen lead pharaoh by the beard
the first of all the ancient land of khem for i wa not born to serv
nai while i mai i rule await the end of rule look forth rei and
see how the rai from mother isi throne flood all the court and all
the citi street and break in light upon the water breast so shall
the moonchild flame flood all thi land of khem what matter it if
er the morn isi must pass to her dominion of the dead and the voic
of meriamun be hush within a sepulchr
so she spoke and went thenc and on her face wa no bride smile but
rather such a gaze as that with which the great sphinx horemku look
out across the desert sand
a strang queen rei said the wander as he paus but what have
i to make in thi tale of a bride and her mad dream
more than thou shalt desir said rei but let us come to the end
and thou shalt hear thy part in the fate

drank and instantli with a great cry she fell dead across the board
then while all the compani sat in terror neither dare to be silent
nor to speak and while meriamun smile scornfulli on the dark head
ly low among the rose on the board pharaoh leap up mad with
wrath and call to the guard to seiz the queen but she wave them

it is well see now the bodi will thi night be laid in the
sanctuari of the templ of osiri that is near the great gate as is
the custom to await the come of the embalm come er she be colder
than my heart come with me rei to the hous of the lord of the dead
she pass to her chamber wrap herself about in a dark robe and
hurri with me to the templ door where we were challeng by the
guard
who pass in the name of the holi osiri speak
rei the master builder and the anoint priest and with him
anoth i made answer open
nai i open not there is on within who mai not be waken

then the priest gaze on the hood form besid me and start back
cry a token nobl rei
i held up the royal signet and bow he open be come within
the templ i lit the taper that had been prepar then by their feebl
light we pass through the outer hall till we came to the curtain that
veil the sanctuari of the holi place and here i quench the taper
for no fire must enter there save that which burn upon the altar of
the dead but through the curtain came rai of light
open said meriamun and i open and hand in hand we pass in on
the altar that is in the place the flame burnt brightli the chamber is
not wide and great for thi is the smallest of the templ of tani
but yet so larg that the light could not reach it wall nor pierc
the overhang gloom and by much gaze scarc could we discov the
outlin of the graven shape of the holi god that ar upon the wall
but the light fell clear upon the great statu of the osiri that wa
seat behind the altar fashion in the black stone of syen wound
about with the corpsecloth wear on hi head the crown of the
upper land and hold in hi hand the crook of divin and the aw
scourg of punish the light shone all about the white and dread
shape that wa place upon hi holi knee the nake shape of lost
hataska who thi night had di at the hand of meriamun there she bow
her head against the sacr breast her long hair stream down on
either side her arm ti across her heart and her ey whenc the
hue of life had scarc fade wide stare at the dark of the
shrine for at tani to thi dai it is the custom for a night to place
those of high birth or offic who die suddenli upon the knee of the
statu of osiri
see i said to the queen speak low for the weight of the haunt
place sank into my heart see how she who scarc an hour ago wa but
a love wanton hath by thine act been clad in majesti greater than all
the glori of the earth bethink thee wilt thou dare inde to summon
back the spirit to the bodi whenc thou hast set it free not easili o
queen mai it be done for all thy magic and if perchanc she answereth
thee it mai well be that the terror of her word shall utterli
oerwhelm us
nai she made answer i am instruct i fear not i know by what
name to call the khou that hover on the threshold of the doubl hall
of truth and how to send it back to it own place i fear not but
if perchanc thou fearest rei depart henc and leav me to the task
alon
nai i said i also am instruct and i go not but i sai to thee
that thi is unholi
then meriamun spoke no morebut lift up her hand she held them
heavenward and so for a while she stood her face fix as wa the
face of dead hataska then as must be done i drew the circl round us
and round the altar and the statu of osiri and that which sat upon
hi knee with my staff i drew it and stand therein i said the holi
word which should ward awai the evil thing that come near in such an
hour
now meriamun threw a certain powder into the flame upon the altar
thrice she threw the powder and as she threw it a ball of flame rose
from the altar and float awai each time that she threw did the ball
of fire rise and thi it wa need to do for by fire onli mai the
dead be manifest and therefor wa a globe of fire given to each of the
three shape that togeth make the threefold spirit of the dead and
when the three globe of fire had melt into air pass over the head
of the statu of osiri thrice did meriamun cry aloud
hataska hataska hataska
by the dread name i summon thee
i summon thee from the threshold of the doubl hall
i summon thee from the gate of judgment
i summon thee from the door of doom
by the link of life and death that is between thee and me i bid thee
come from where thou art and make answer to that which i shall ask of
thee
she ceas but no answer came still the cold osiri smile and still
the bodi on hi knee sat with open ey gaze into nothing
not thu easili i whisper mai thi dread thing be done thou
art instruct in the word of fear if thou darest let it pass thy
lip or let us be gone
nai it shall be spoken she saidand thu she wrought pass to
the statu she hid her head within her cloak and with both hand grasp
the feet of the slain hataska
see thi i also crouch upon the floor and hid my face for it is
death to hear that word with an uncov face
then in so soft a whisper that scarc had it breath stir a feather
on her lip meriamun spoke the word of fear which mai not be written
whose sound ha power to pass all space and open the ear of the dead
who dwell in amenti softli she said it for in a shout of thunder it
wa caught up and echo from her lip and down the etern hall it
seem to rush on the feet of storm and the wing of wind so that
the roof rock and the deep foundat of the templ quiver like a
windstir tree
unveil ye mortal cri a dread voic and look upon the sight
of fear that ye have dare to summon
and i rose and cast my cloak from about my face and gaze then sank
down in terror for round about the circl that i had drawn press all
the multitud of the dead countless as the desert sand thei press
gaze with aw ey upon us twain and the fire that wa on the altar
di awai but yet wa there light for it shone from those dead ey
and in the ey of lost hataska there wa light
and ever the face chang never for on beat of time did thei ceas
to chang for as we gaze upon a face it would melt even to the ey
and round these same ey again would gather but no more the same and
like the slope side of pyramid were the face set about us from the
ground to the templ roofand on us were fix their glow ey
and i rei be instruct knew that to suffer myself to be overcom
with terror wa death as it wa death to pass without the circl so in
my heart i call upon osiri lord of the dead to protect us and even
as i name the ineff name lo all the thousand thousand face bent
themselv in ador and then turn look each upon the other
even as though each spake to each and chang and swiftli chang
meriamun i said gather up my strength fear not but bewar
nai wherefor should i fear she answer becaus the veil of
sens is torn and for an hour we see those who ar ever about our path
and whose ey watch our most secret thought continu i fear not
and she step boldli even to the edg of the circl and cri
all hail ye sahu spirit of the aw dead among whom i also shall
be number
and as she came the chang face shrunk awai leav a space befor
her and in the space there grew two arm mighti and black that
stretch themselv toward her until there wa not the length of
three grain of wheat betwixt the clutch finger and her breast
but meriamun onli laugh and drew back a space
not so thou enemi she said thi circl thou mayst not break it
is too strong for thee but to the work hataska onc again by the link
of life and death i summon theeand thi time thou must come thou who
wast a wanton and now art greater than the queen
and as she spoke from the dead form of the woman on osiri knee there
issu forth anoth form and stood befor us as a snake issu from
it slough and as wa the dead hataska so wa thi form featur for
featur look for look and limb for limb but still the corps rest
upon osiri knee for thi wa but the ka that stood befor us
and thu spoke the voic of hataska in the lip of the ka
what wouldest thou with me who am no more of thy compani o thou by
whose hand my bodi did perish why troublest thou me
and meriamun made answer i would thi of thee that thou shouldest
declar unto me the futur even in the presenc of thi great compani
speak i command thee
and the ka said nai meriamun that i cannot do for i am but the
kath dweller in the tomb the guardian of what wa hataska whom
thou didst slai whom i must watch through all the dai of death till
resurrect is of the futur i know naught seek thou that which
know
stand thou on on side quoth the queen and the dweller in the tomb
obei
then onc more she call upon hataska and there came a sound of
rush wing and behold on the head of the statu of osiri sat a
great bird feather as it were with gold but the bird had the head of
a woman and the face wa fashion as the face of hataska and thu it
spoke that wa the bai
what wouldest thou with me meriamun who am no more of thy compani
why dost thou draw me from the under world thou by whose hand my bodi
did perish
and meriamun said thi i would of thee that thou shouldest declar
unto me the futur speak i command thee
and the bai said nai meriamun that i cannot do i am but the bai
of her who wa hataska and i fly from death to life and life to death
till the hour of awaken is of the futur i know naught seek thou
that which know
rest thou where thou art quoth the queen and there it rest aw
to see
then onc more meriamun call upon hataska bid her hear the
summon where she wa
and behold the ey of the dead on that wa upon the knee of osiri
glow and glow the ey of the dweller in the tomb and of the
wing messeng who sat abov and then there wa a sound as the sound
of wind and from abov cleav the dark descend a tongu of
flame and rest on the brow of the dead hataska and the ey of all
the thousand thousand spirit turn and gaze upon the tongu of flame
and then dead hataska spokethough her lip move not yet she spoke
and thi she said
what wouldest thou with me meriamun who am no more of thy compani
why dost thou dare to troubl me thou by whose hand my bodi did perish
draw me from the threshold of the doubl hall of truth back to the
over world
and meriamun the queen said oh thou khou for thi purpos have i
call thee i am aweari of my dai and i fain would learn the futur
the futur fain would i learn but the fork tongu of that which
sleep tell me no word and the lip of that which is acold ar dumb
tell me then thou i charg thee by the word that ha power to open
the lip of the dead thou who in all thing art instruct what shall

out the north whom thou hast love whom thou shalt love from life to

amenti is thy name known high is thy fate and through blood and sorrow

first i command thee by the word of dread and by the link of life and
death declar unto me if here upon the earth and in thi life i shall
possess him whom i shall love

shame and jealou agoni he shall be taken from thee by on who is
stronger than thou though thou art strong by on more beauti than
thou though thou art beauti and ruin thou shalt give him for hi
guerdon and ruin of the heart shalt thou harvest for thy portion but
for thi time she shall escap thee whose footstep march with thine

her who is mine enemi and the face of him who is my love
thrice mayest thou speak to me o thou greatli dare answer the
dread khou and thrice i mai make repli and then farewel till i meet
thee on the threshold of the hall whenc thou hast drawn me look now on
the face of that hataska whom thou slewest
and we look and behold the face of dead hataska chang and chang
the face of the doubl the ka that stood on on side and the face
of the great bird the bai that spread hi wing about the head of
osiri and thei grew beauti ye most exceed beauti so that
it cannot be told and the beauti wa that of a woman asleep then lo
there hung abov hataska as it were the shadow of on who wa watch
her sleep and hi face we saw not o thou wander it wa hidden by
the visor of a golden twohorn helm and in that helm stood fast the
bronz point of a broken spear but he wa clad in the armour of the
peopl of the northern sea the aquaiusha and hi hair fell dark about
hi shoulder like the petal of the hyacinth flower
behold thine enemi and behold thy love farewel said the dread
khou speak through dead hataska lip and as the word di the
beauti fade and the tongu of flame shot upward and wa lost and onc
more the ey of the thousand thousand dead turn and look upon each
other even as though their lip whisper each to each
but for a while meriamun stood silent as on amaz then awak
she wave her hand and cri begon thou bai begon thou ka
and the great bird whereof the face wa as the face of hataska spread
hi golden wing and pass awai to hi own place and the ka that
wa in the semblanc of hataska drew near to the dead on knee and
pass back into her from whom she came and all the thousand thousand
face melt though the fieri ey still gaze upon us
then meriamun cover her head and onc more spoke the aw word and
i also cover up my head but as must be done thi second time she
call the word aloud and yet though she call it loud it came but
as a tini whisper from her lip nevertheless at the sound of it onc
more wa the templ shaken as by a storm
then meriamun unveil and behold again the fire burn upon the
altar and on the knee of the osiri sat hataska cold and still in
death and round them wa empti and silenc
now that all is done i greatli fear for that which ha been and that
which shall be lead me henc o rei son of pame for i can no more

book ii
i
the prophet of the apura
these thing ar not without the god said the wander who wa
call eperitu when he had heard all the tale of rei the priest son
of pame the head architect the command of the legion of amen then
he sat silent for a while and at last rais hi ey and look upon
the old man
thou hast told a strang tale rei over mani a sea have i wander
and in mani a land i have sojourn i have seen the wai of mani
peopl and have heard the voic of the immort god dream have
come to me and marvel have compass me about it ha been laid upon me
to go down into hade that land which thou namest amenti and to look
on the tribe of the dead but never till now have i known so strang
a thing for mark thou when first i beheld thi fair queen of thine i
thought she look upon me strang as on who knew my face and now
rei if thou speakest truth she deem that she ha met me in the
wai of night and magic sai then who wa the man of the vision of the
queen the man with dark and curl lock clad in golden armour after
the fashion of the achan whom ye name the aquaiusha wear on hi
head a golden helm wherein wa fix a broken spear
befor me sit such a man said rei or perchanc it is a god that my

read me the riddl thou that art instruct
now the ag priest look upon the ground then turn hi ey upward
and with mutter lip prai to thoth the god of wisdom and when he
had made an end of prayer he spoke
thou art the man he said out of the sea thou hast come to bring
the doom of love on the ladi meriamun and on thyself the doom of death
thi i knew but of the rest i know noth now i prai thee oh thou
who comest in the armour of the north thou whose face is cloth in
beauti and who art of all men the mightiest and hast of all men the
sweetest and most guil tongu go back go back into the sea whenc
thou camest and the land whenc thou hast wander
not thu easili mai men escap their doom quoth the wander my
death mai come as come it must but know thi rei i do not seek the
love of meriamun
then it well mai chanc that thou shalt find it for ever those who
seek love lose and those who seek not find
i am come to seek anoth love said the wander and i seek her
till i die
then i prai the god that thou mayest find her and that khem mai thu
be save from sorrow but here in egypt there is no woman so fair as
meriamun and thou must seek farther as quickli as mai be and now
eperitu behold i must awai to do servic in the templ of the holi
amen for i am hi high priest but i am command by pharaoh first to
bring thee to the feast at the palac
then he led the wander from hi chamber and brought him by a side
entranc to the great palac of the pharaoh at tani near the templ
of ptah and first he took him to a chamber that had been made readi for
him in the palac a beauti chamber richli paint with beasthead

bath him and anoint him with fragrant oil and crown him with
lotu flower when thei had bath him thei bade him lai asid hi
golden armour and hi bow and the quiver full of arrow but thi the
wander would not do for as he laid the black bow down it thrill
with a thin sound of war so rei led him arm as he wa to a certain
antechamb and there he left him sai that he would return again
when the feast wa done trumpet blare as the wander wait drum

in all her state and pride of beauti and behind her came the pharaoh
he wa a tall man but illmad and heavybrow and to the wander it
seem that he wa heavyheart too and that care and terror of evil

wall rames miamun drove the thousand of the khita befor hi singl
valour here men hunt wildfowl through the marsh with a great cat
for their hound never had the wander beheld such a hall sinc he
sup with the sea king of the fairi isl on the da rais abov
the rest sat the pharaoh and by him sat meriamun the queen and by the
queen sat the wander in the golden armour of pari and he lean the
black bow against hi ivori chair
now the feast went on and men at and drank the queen spoke littl but
she watch the wander beneath the lid of her deepfring ey
suddenli as thei feast and grew merri the door at the end of the
chamber were thrown wide the guard fell back in fear and behold at
the end of the hall stood two men their face were tawni dry wast
with desert wander their nose were hook like eagl beak and
their ey were yellow as the ey of lion thei were clad in rough
skin of beast girdl about their waist with leathern thong and
fierc thei lift their nake arm and wave their wand of cedar
both men were old on wa whitebeard the other wa shaven smooth
like the priest of egypt as thei lift the rod on high the guard
shrank like beaten hound and all the guest hid their face save
meriamun and the wander alon even pharaoh dare not look on them
but he murmur angrili in hi beard
by the name of osiri he said here be those soothsay of the
apura onc again now death wait on those who let them pass the door
then on of the two men he who wa shaven like a priest cri with a
great voic
pharaoh pharaoh pharaoh hearken to the word of jahveh wilt thou
let the peopl go
i will not let them go he answer
pharaoh pharaoh pharaoh hearken to the word of jahveh if thou
wilt not let the peopl go then shall all the firstborn of khem of the
princ and the slave of the ox and the ass be smitten of jahveh wilt
thou let the peopl go
now pharaoh hearken and those who were at the feast rose and cri
with a loud voic
o pharaoh let the peopl go great woe ar fallen upon khem becaus
of the apura o pharaoh let the peopl go
now pharaoh heart wa soften and he wa mind to let them go but
meriamun turn to him and said
thou shalt not let the peopl go it is not these slave nor the god
of these slave who bring the plagu on khem but it is that strang
goddess the fals hathor who dwell here in the citi of tani be
not so fearfulev hadst thou a coward heart drive the fals hathor
thenc if thou wilt but hold these slave to their bondag i still
have citi that must be built and yon slave shall build them
then the pharaoh cri henc i bid you henc and tomorrow shall
your peopl be laden with a doubl burden and their back shall be red
with stripe i will not let the peopl go
then the two men cri aloud and point upward with their staff thei
vanish from the hall and none dare to lai hand on them but those
who sat at the feast murmur much
now the wander marvel why pharaoh did not command the guard to cut
down these unbidden guest who spoil hi festiv the queen meriamun
saw the wonder in hi ey and turn to him
know thou eperitu she said that great plagu have come of late
on thi land of oursplagu of lice and frog and fli and dark
and the chang of pure water to blood and these thing our lord
the pharaoh deem have been brought upon us by the curs of yonder
magician conjur and priest among certain slave who work in the
land at the build of our citi but i know well that the curs come
on us from hathor the ladi of love becaus of that woman who hath set
herself up here in tani and is worship as the hathor
why then o queen said the wander is thi fals goddess suffer
to abid in your fair citi for as i know well the immort god
ar ever anger with those who turn from their worship to bow befor
strang altar
why is she suffer nai ask of pharaoh my lord methink it is
becaus her beauti is more than the beauti of women so the men sai who
have look on it but i have not seen it for onli those men see it who
go to worship at her shrine and then from afar it is not meet that the
queen of all the land should worship at the shrine of a strang woman
comelik thyself eperitusfrom none know where if inde she be a
woman and not a fiend from the under world but if thou wouldest learn
more ask my lord the pharaoh for he know the shrine of the fals
hathor and he know who guard it and what is it that bar the wai
now the wander turn to pharaoh sai o pharaoh mai i know the
truth of thi mysteri
then meneptah look up and there wa doubt and troubl on hi heavi
face
i will tell thee readili thou wander for perchanc such a man as
thou who hast travel in mani land and seen the face of mani god
mai understand the tale and mai help me in the dai of my father
the holi rames miamun the keeper of the templ of the divin hathor
awok and lo in the sanctuari of the templ wa a woman in the garb
of the aquaiusha who wa beauti self but when thei look upon her
none could tell the semblanc of her beauti for to on she seem dark
and to the other fair and to each man of them she show a divers
loveli she smile upon them and sang most sweetli and love
enter their heart so that it seem to each man that she onli wa
hi heart desir but when ani man would have come nearer and embrac
her there wa that about her which drove him back and if he strove
again behold he fell down dead so at last thei subdu their heart
and desir her no more but worship her as the hathor come to earth
and made offer of food and drink to her and prayer so three
year pass and at the end of the third year the keeper of the templ
look and the hathor wa gone noth remain of her but a memori
yet there were some who said that thi memori wa dearer than all els
that the world ha to give
twenti more season went by and i sat upon the throne of my father
and wa lord of the doubl crown and on a dai a messeng came
run and cri
now is hathor come back to khem now is hathor come back to khem and
as of old none mai draw near her beauti then i went to see and lo
befor the templ of hathor a great multitud wa gather and there
on the pylon brow stood the hathor self shine with chang beauti
like the dawn and as of old she sang sweet song and to each man who
heard her voic wa the voic of hi own belov live and lost to
him or dead and lost now everi man ha such a grave in hi heart as
that whenc hathor seem to rise in chang beauti month by month she
sing thu on dai in everi month and mani a man ha sought to win her
and her favour but in the doorwai ar thei who meet him and press him
back and if he still struggl on there come a clang of sword and he
fall dead but no wound is found on him and wander thi is truth
for i myself have striven and have been press back by that which
guard her but i alon of men who have look on her and heard her
strove not a second time and so save myself aliv
thou alon of men lovest life more than the world desir said the
queen thou hast ever sicken for the love of thi strang witch but
thy life thou lovest even better than her beauti and thou dost not dare
attempt again the adventur of her embrac know eperitu that thi
sorrow is come upon the land that all men love yonder witch and rave of
her and to each she wear a differ face and sing in anoth voic
when she stand upon the pylon tower then thou wilt see the mad
with which she ha smitten them for thei will weep and prai and tear
their hair then thei will rush through the templ court and up to the
templ door and be thrust back again by that which guard her but
some will yet strive madli on and thou wilt hear the clash of arm
and thei will fall dead befor thee accurs is the land i tell thee
wander becaus of that phantom it is accurs for it is she who
bring these woe on khem from her not from our slave and their mad
conjur come plagu i sai and all evil thing and till a man be
found who mai pass her guard and come face to face with the witch and
slai her plagu and woe and evil thing shall be the daili bread of
khem perchanc wander thou art such a man and she look on him
strang yet if so thi is my counsel that thou go not up against
her lest thou also be bewitch and a great man be lost to us
now the wander turn the matter over in hi heart and made answer
perchanc ladi my strength and the favour of the god might serv
me in such a quest but methink that thi woman is meeter for word of
love and the kiss of men than to be slain with the sharp sword if
inde she be not of the number of the immort
now meriamun flush and frown
it is not fit so to talk befor me she said of thi be sure
that if the witch mai be come at she shall be slain and given to osiri
for a bride
now the wander saw that the ladi meriamun wa jealou of the beauti
and renown and love of her who dwelt in the templ and wa call the
strang hathor and he held hi peac for he knew when to be silent
ii
the night of dread
the feast drag slowli on for fear wa of the compani the men and
women were silent and when thei drank it wa as if on had pour a
littl oil on a dy fire life flame up in them for a moment their

he spoke and drain the mighti cup and set it down on the board and
even as he laid down the cup and as the queen look at him with ey
of wrath there came from the bow besid hi seat a faint shrill sound
a ring and a sing of the bow a nois of run string and a
sound as of rush arrow
the warrior heard it and hi ey burn with the light of battl for
he knew well that the swift shaft should soon fly to the heart of the
doom pharaoh awok and heard it and heard it the ladi meriamun the
queen and she look on the wander astonish and look on the bow

bridg of war soon shall shaft be fly and ghost go down to doom
summon thy guard i bid thee for foe ar near
terror conquer the drunken of pharaoh he bade the guard who
stood behind hi chair summon all their compani thei went forth and a
great hush fell again upon the hall of banquet and upon those who sat
at meat therein the silenc grew deadli still like air befor the
thunder and men heart sank within them and turn to water in their
breast onli odysseu wonder and thought on the battl to be though
whenc the foe might come he knew not and meriamun sat erect in her
ivori chair and look down the gloriou hall
deeper grew the silenc and deeper yet and more and more the cloud of
fear gather in the heart of men then suddenli through all the hall
there wa a rush like the rush of mighti wing the deep foundat
of the palac rock and to the sight of men the roof abov seem
to burst asund and lo abov them against the distanc of the sky
there swept a shape of fear and the star shone through it raiment
then the roof close in again and for a moment space onc more there
wa silenc whilst men look with white face each on each and even
the stout heart of the wander stood still
then suddenli all down the hall from thi place and from that men rose
up and with on great cry fell down dead thi on across the board
and that on across the floor the wander grasp hi bow and count
from among those who sat at meat twenti and on had fallen dead yet
those who live sat gaze emptili for so stricken with fear were thei
that scarc did each on know if it wa he himself who lai dead or hi
brother who had sat by hi side
but meriamun look down the hall with cold ey for she fear neither
death nor life nor god nor man
and while she look and while the wander count there rose a faint
murmur sound from the citi without a sound that grew and grew the
thunder of myriad feet that run befor the death of king then the
door burst asund and a woman sped through them in her night robe
and in her arm she bore the nake bodi of a boi
pharaoh she cri pharaoh and thou o queen look upon thy
sonthi firstborn sondead is thy son o pharaoh dead is thy son o
queen in my arm he di suddenli as i lull him to hi rest and she
laid the bodi of the child down on the board among the vessel of gold
among the garland of lotu flower and the beaker of roser wine
then pharaoh rose and rent hi purpl robe and wept aloud meriamun
rose too and lift the bodi of her son clasp it to her breast and
her ey were terribl with wrath and grief but she wept not
see now the curs that thi evil woman thi fals hathor hath brought
upon us she said
but the veri guest sprang up cry it is not the hathor whom we
worship it is not the holi hathor it is the god of those dark apura
whom thou o queen wilt not let go on thy head and the head of pharaoh
be it and even as thei cri the murmur without grew to a shriek of
woe a shriek so wild and terribl that the palac wall rang again
that shriek rose and yet a third time never wa such a cry heard
in egypt and now for the first time in all hi dai the face of the
wander grew white with fear and in fear of heart he prai for
succour to hi goddessto aphrodit the daughter of dion
again the door behind them burst open and the guard flock inmighti
men of mani foreign land but now their face were wan their ey
stare wide and their jaw hung down but at the sound of the clang
of their har the strength of the wander came back to him again
for the god and their vengeanc he fear but not the sword of man
and now onc more the bow sang aloud he grasp it he bent it with hi
mighti knee and strung it cry

then the captain answer these be all of the guard who ar left

ladi he made answer though a man mai fear the god without shame

trembl guard took heart and to the number of fifti and on rang
themselv on the edg of the da in a doubl line then thei also made
readi their bow and loosen the arrow in their quiver
now from without there came a roar of men and anon while those of the
hous of pharaoh and of the guest and nobl who sat at the feast and
yet live fled behind the soldier the brazen door were burst in with
mighti blow and through them a great arm multitud surg along
the hall there came soldier broken from their rank there came the
embalm of the dead their hand were overful of work tonight but
thei left their work undon death had smitten some even of these and
their fellow did not shrink back from them now there came the smith
black from the forg and the scribe bow with endless write and
the dyer with hi purpl hand and the fisher from the stream and the
stunt weaver from the loom and the leper from the templ gate thei
were mad with lust of life a starvel life that the king had tax
when he let not the apura go thei were mad with fear of death their
women follow them with dead children in their arm thei smote down

now as thei cri thei saw pharaoh meneptah cower behind the doubl
line of guard and thei saw the queen meriamun who cower not but
stood silent abov the din then she thrust her wai through the guard
and yet hold the bodi of the child to her breast she stood befor
them with ey that flash more brightli than the uraeu crown upon her

scream
the hathor we love but you we hate for ye have brought these woe

thei cri thei brawl thei cast footstool and stone at the guard
and then a certain tall man among them drew a bow straight at the
queen fair breast he aim hi arrow and swift and true it sped
toward her she saw the light gleam upon it shine barb and then she
did what no woman but meriamun would have done no not to save herself
from deathsh held out the nake bodi of her son as a warrior hold

the wander saw it and wonder at the horror of the deed for he had
seen no such deed in all hi dai then shout aloud the terribl
warcri of the achan he leapt upon the board befor him and as he
leapt hi golden armour clang
glanc around he fix an arrow to the string and drew to hi ear
that great bow which none but he might so much as bend then as he
loos the string sang like a swallow and the shaft scream through

ripe to die in vain did the arrow of the slayer smite upon that
golden har thei were but as hail upon the templ roof but as
drive snow upon the wild stag horn thei struck thei rattl and
down thei drop like snow or bound back and lai upon the board
the swallow string sang the black bow twang and the bitter arrow
shriek as thei flew
now the wander shaft were spent and he judg that their case wa
desper for out of the door of the hall that were behind them and
from the chamber of the women arm men burst in also take them on
the flank and rear but the wander wa old in war and without a match
in all it wai the captain of the guard wa slain with a spear stroke
and the wander took hi place call to the men such of them as
were left aliv to form a circl on the da and within the circl he
set those of the hous of pharaoh and the women who were at the feast
and to pharaoh he cast a slain man sword bid him strike for life
and throne if he never struck befor but the heart wa out of pharaoh
becaus of the death of hi son and the wine about hi wit and the
terror he had seen then meriamun the queen snatch the sword from hi
trembl hand and stood hold it to guard her life for she disdain
to crouch upon the ground as did the other women but stood upright
behind the wander and heed not the spear and arrow that dealt

now the slayer came on shout and clamber upon the da then
the wander rush on them with sword drawn and shield on high and so
swift he smote that men might not guard for thei saw as it were three

hi heart grew fear for the end and meriamun the queen also bade
them to be of good courag and if need were to die like men then onc
again the wave of war roll in upon them and the strife grew fierc
and desper the iron hedg of spear wa wellnigh broken and now
the wander do such deed as had not been known in khem stood
alon between meriamun the queen and the sword that thirst for her
life and the life of pharaoh then of a sudden from far down the great
hall of banquet there came a loud cry that shrill abov the clash of

thee thy spearpoint thou didst lend me here take it again and he
toss the spearhead to the queen jewel
i thank thee lord answer the sidonian thrust it in hi girdl
but he mutter between hi teeth the gift of enemi ar gift of

the wander did on hi mail set the helmet on hi head and spoke to
rei come forth friend and show me thy citi
but rei wa watch the smile on the face of the sidonian and he
deem it cruel and crafti and warlik like the laugh of the sardana
of the sea he said nought but call a guard of soldier and with the
wander he pass the palac gate and went out into the citi
the sight wa strang and it wa not thu that the old man who love
hi land would have had the wander see it
from all the wealthi hous and from mani of the poorer sort rang the
wail of the women mourner as thei sang their dirg for the dead
but in the meaner quarter mani a hovel wa mark with three smear
of blood dash on each pillar of the door and on the lintel and the
sound that came from these dwell wa the cry of mirth and festiv
there were two peopl on laugh on lament and in and out of
the hous mark with the splash of blood women were ever go with
empti hand or come with hand full of jewel of gold of silver
ring of cup and purpl stuff empti thei went out laden thei came
in dark men and women with keen black ey and the featur of bird
of prei thei went thei came thei clamour with delight among the
mourn of the men and women of khem and none laid a hand on them
none refus them
on tall fellow snatch at the staff of rei
lend me thy staff old man he said sneer lend me thy jewel
staff for my journei i do but borrow it when yakb come from the
desert thou shalt have it again
but the wander turn on the fellow with such a glanc that he fell
back
i have seen thee befor he said and he laugh over hi shoulder
as he went i saw thee last night at the feast and heard thy great
bow sing thou art not of the folk of khem thei ar a gentl folk and
yakb win favour in their sight
what pass now in thi haunt land of thine old man said
the wander for of all the sight that i have seen thi is the
strangest none lift a hand to save hi good from the thief
rei the priest groan aloud
evil dai have come upon khem he said the apura spoil the peopl of
khem er thei fly into the wilder
even as he spoke there came a great ladi weep for her husband wa
dead and her son and her brother all were gone in the breath of the
pestil she wa of the royal hous and richli deck with gold and
jewel and the slave who fan her as she went to the templ of ptah
to worship wore gold chain upon their neck two women of the apura
saw her and ran to her cry
lend to us those golden ornament thou wearest
then without a word she took her gold bracelet and chain and ring
and let them all fall in a heap at her feet the women of the apura took
them all and mock her cry
where now is thy husband and thy son and thy brother thou who art of
pharaoh hous now thou payest us for the labour of our hand and for
the brick that we made without straw gather leav and rush in
the sun now thou payest for the stick in the hand of the overs
where now is thy husband and thy son and thy brother and thei went
still mock and left the ladi weep
but of all sight the wander held thi strangest and mani such there
were to see at first he would have taken back the spoil and given it
to those who wore it but rei the priest prai him to forbear lest the
curs should strike them also so thei press on through the tumult
ever see new sight of greed and death and sorrow here a mother wept
over her babe here a bride over her husbandthat night the groom of
her and of death here the fiercefac apura clamour like gull
tore the silver trinket from the children of those of the baser sort
or the sacr amulet from the mummi of those who were laid out for
burial and here a watercarri wail over the carcass of the ass that
won him hi livelihood
at length pass through the crowd thei came to a templ that stood
near to the templ of the god ptah the pylon of thi templ face
toward the hous of the citi but the inner court were built against
the wall of tani and look out across the face of the water though
not on of the largest templ it wa veri strong and beauti in it
shape it wa built of the black stone of syen and all the polish
face of the stone wa graven with imag of the holi hathor here she
wore a cow head and here the face of a woman but she alwai bore
in her hand the lotushead staff and the holi token of life and her
neck wa encircl with the collar of the god
here dwell that strang hathor to whom thou didst drink last night
eperitu said rei the priest it wa a wild pledg to drink befor
the queen who swear that she bring these woe on khem though
inde she is guiltless of thi with all the blood on her beauti
head the apura and their apost sorcer whom we ourselv
instruct bring the plagu on us
doe the hathor manifest herself thi dai ask the wander
that we will ask of the priest eperitu follow thou me
now thei pass down the avenu of sphinx within the wall of brick
into the garden plot of the goddess and so on through the gate of the
outer tower a priest who watch there threw them wide at the sign that
wa given of rei the masterbuild the belov of pharaoh and thei
came to the outer court befor the second tower thei halt and rei
show to the wander that place upon the pylon roof where the hathor
wa wont to stand and sing till the hearer heart were melt like
wax here thei knock onc more and were admit to the hall of
assembl where the priest were gather throw dust upon their head
and mourn those among them who had di with the firstborn when thei
saw rei the instruct the prophet of amen and the wander clad in
golden armour who wa with him thei ceas from their mourn and an
ancient priest of their number came forward and greet rei ask
him of hi errand then rei took the wander by the hand and made him
known to the priest and told him of those deed that he had done and
how he had save the life of pharaoh and of those of the royal hous who
sat at the feast with pharaoh
but when will the ladi hathor sing upon her tower top said rei for
the stranger desir to see her and hear her
the templ priest bow befor the wander and answer grave
on the third morn from now the holi hathor show herself upon the
templ top he said but thou mighti lord who art risen from the
sea hearken to my warn and if inde thou art no god dare not to
look upon her beauti if thou dost look then thy fate shall be as the
fate of those who have look befor and have love and have di for
the sake of the hathor
no god am i said the wander laugh yet perchanc i shall
dare to look and dare to face whatev it be that guard her if my
heart bid me see her nearer
then there shall be an end of thee and thy wander said the
priest now follow me and i will show thee those men who last sought
to win the hathor
he took him by the hand and led him through passag hewn in the wall
till thei came to a deep and gloomi cell where the golden armour of the
wander shone like a lamp at ev the cell wa built against the citi
wall and scarc a thread of light came into the chink between roof
and wall all about the chamber were bath fashion of bronz and in
the bath lai duski shape of darkskin men of egypt there thei lai
and in the faint light their limb were be anoint by some sadfac
attend as folk were anoint by merri girl in the shine bath
of the wander home when rei and eperitu came near the sadfac
bathmen shrank awai in shame as dog shrink from their evil meat at
night when a travel goe past
marvel at the strang sight the bather and the bath the
wander look more close and hi stout heart sank within him for
all these were dead who lai in the bath of bronz and it wa not water
that flow about their limb but evilsmel natron
here lie those said the priest who last strove to come near the
holi hathor and to pass into the shrine of the templ where night and
dai she sit and sing and weav with her golden shuttl here thei
lie the half of a score on by on thei rush to embrac her and on
by on thei were smitten down here thei ar be attir for the tomb
for we give them all rich burial
truli quoth the wander i left the world of light behind me when i
look on the bloodr sea and sail into the black gloom off pharo
more evil sight have i seen in thi haunt land than in all the citi
where i have wander and on all the sea that i have sail
then be warn said the priest for if thou dost follow where thei
went and desir what thei desir thou too shalt lie in yonder bath
and be wash of yonder water for whatev be fals thi is true
that he who seek love ofttim find doom but here he find it most
speedili
the wander look again at the dead and at their minist and he
shudder till hi har rattl he fear not the face of death in
war or on the sea but thi wa a new thing littl he love the sight
of the brazen bath and those who lai there the light of the sun and
the breath of air seem good to him and he step quickli from the
chamber while the priest smile to himself but when he reach the
outer air hi heart came back to him and he began to ask again about
the hathorwher she dwelt and what it wa that slew her lover
i will show thee answer the priest and brought him through the
hall of assembl to a certain narrow wai that led to a court in the
centr of the court stood the holi shrine of the hathor it wa a great
chamber built of alabast light from the roof alon and shut in
with brazen door befor which hung curtain of tyrian web from the
roof of the shrine a stairwai ran overhead to the roof of the templ and
so to the inner pylon tower
yonder stranger the holi goddess dwell within the alabast shrine
said the priest by that stair she pass to the templ roof and
thenc to the pylon top there by the curtain onc in everi dai we
place food and it is drawn into the sanctuari how we know not for
none of us have set foot there nor seen the hathor face to face now
when the goddess ha stood upon the pylon and sung to the multitud
below she pass back to the shrine then the brazen outer door of the
templ court ar thrown wide and the doom rush on madli on by on
toward the drawn curtain but befor thei pass the curtain thei
ar thrust back yet thei strive to pass then we hear a sound of the
clash of weapon and the men fall dead without a word while the song
of the hathor swell from within
and who ar her swordsmen said the wander
that we know not stranger no man ha live to tell come draw near
to the door of the shrine and hearken mayb thou wilt hear the hathor
sing have no fear thou needst not approach the guard space
then the wander drew near with a doubt heart but rei the priest
stood afar off though the templ priest came close enough at the
curtain thei stop and listen then from within the shrine there
came a sound of sing wild and sweet and shrill and the voic of it
stir the wander strang bring to hi mind memori of that
ithaca of which he wa lord and which he should see no more of the
happi dai of youth and of the godbuilt wall of windi ilio but he
could not have told why he thought on these thing nor why hi heart
wa thu strang stir within him
hearken the hathor sing as she weav the doom of men said the
priest and as he spoke the sing end
then the wander took counsel with himself whether he should then and
there burst the door and take hi fortun or whether he should forbear
for that while but in the end he determin to forbear and see with hi
own ey what befel those who strove to win the wai
so he drew back wonder much and bid farewel to the ag
priest he went with rei the master builder through the town of tani
where the apura were still spoil the peopl of khem and he came to
the palac where he wa lodg here he turn over in hi mind how he
might see the strang woman of the templ and yet escap the bath of
bronz there he sat and thought till at length the night drew on and
on came to summon him to sup with pharaoh in the hall then he rose
up and went and meet pharaoh and meriamun the queen in the outer
chamber pass in after them to the hall and on to the da which he
had held against the rabbl for the place wa clear of dead and save
for certain stain upon the marbl floor that might not be wash awai
and for some few arrow that yet were fix high up in the wall or in
the lofti roof there wa noth to tell of the great frai that had
been fought but on dai gone
heavi wa the face of pharaoh and the few who sat with him were sad
enough becaus of the death of so mani whom thei love and the shame
and sorrow that had fallen upon khem but there were no tear for her
on child in the ey of meriamun the queen anger not grief tore her
heart becaus pharaoh had let the apura go for ever as thei sat at
the sad feast there came a sound of the tramp feet of armi and of
low cattl and song of triumph sung by ten thousand voic and
thu thei sang the song of the apura
a lamp for our feet the lord hath litten
sign hath he shown in the land of khem
the king of the nation our lord hath smitten
hi shoe hath he cast oer the god of them
he hath made him a mock of the heifer of isi
he hath broken the chariot rein of ra
on yakb he cri and hi folk aris
and the knee of the nation ar loos in aw
he give us their good for a spoil to gather
jewel of silver and vessel of gold
for yahveh of old is our friend and father
and cherisheth yakb he chose of old
the god of the peopl our lord hath chidden
their court hath he fill with hi creep thing
the light of the face of the sun he hath hidden
and broken the scourg in the hand of king
he hath chasten hi peopl with stripe and scourg
our back hath he burden with grievou weight
but hi children shall rise as a sea that surg
and flood the field of the men he hate
the king of the nation our lord hath smitten
hi shoe hath he cast oer the god of them
but a lamp for our feet the lord hath litten
wonder hath he wrought in the land of khem
thu thei sang and the sing wa so wild that the wander crave
leav to go and stand at the palac gate lest the apura should rush in
and spoil the treasurechamb
the king nod but meriamun rose and went with the wander as he
took hi bow and pass to the great gate
there thei stood in the shadow of the gate and thi is what thei
beheld a great light of mani torch wa flare along the roadwai
in front then came a bodi of men rude arm with pike and the
torchlight shone on the glitter of bronz and on the gold helm of which
thei had spoil the soldier of khem next came a troop of wild women
danc and beat timbrel and sing the triumphant hymn of scorn
next with a space between tramp eight strong blackbeard men
bear on their shoulder a great gild coffin cover with carven
and paint sign
it is the bodi of their prophet who brought them hither out of their
land of hunger whisper meriamun slave ye shall hunger yet in the
wilder and clamour for the fleshpot of khem
then she cri in a loud voic for her passion overcam her and she
prophesi to those who bare the coffin not on soul of you that live
shall see the land where your conjur is lead you ye shall thirst
ye shall hunger ye shall call on the god of khem and thei shall not
hear you ye shall die and your bone shall whiten the wilder
farewel set go with you farewel
so she cri and point down the wai and so fierc wa her gaze and
so aw were her word that the peopl of the apura trembl and the
women ceas to sing
the wander watch the queen and marvel never had woman such a
hardi heart he muse and it were ill to cross her in love or war
thei will sing no more at my gate murmur meriamun with a smile
come wander thei await us and she gave him her hand that he might
lead her
so thei went back to the banquet hall
thei hearken as thei sat till far in the night and still the apura
pass countless as the sand of the sea at length all were gone and
the sound of their feet di awai in the distanc then meriamun the
queen turn to pharaoh and spake bitterli
thou art a coward meneptah ay a coward and a slave at heart in thy
fear of the curs that the fals hathor hath laid on us she whom thou
dost worship to thy shame thou hast let these slave go otherwis
had our father dealt with them great rames miamun the hammer of the
khita now thei ar gone hiss curs on the land that bare them and
rob those who nurs them up while thei were yet a littl peopl as
a mother nurs her child
what then might i do said pharaoh
there is nought to do all is done answer meriamun
what is thy counsel wander
it is ill for a stranger to offer counsel said the wander
nai speak cri the queen
i know not the god of thi land he answer if these peopl
be favour of the god i sai sit still but if not then said the
wander wise in war let pharaoh gather hi host follow after the
peopl take them unawar and smite them utterli it is no hard task
thei ar so mix a multitud and cumber with much baggag
thi wa to speak as the queen love to hear now she clap her hand
and cri
listen listen to good counsel pharaoh
and now that the apura were gone hi fear of them went also and as
he drank wine pharaoh grew bold till at last he sprang to hi feet
and swore by amen by osiri by ptah and by hi fathergreat
ramesesthat he would follow after the apura and smite them and
instantli he sent forth messeng to summon the captain of hi host in
the hall of assembl
thither the captain came and their plan were made and messeng
hurri forth to the governor of other great citi bid them send
troop to join the host of pharaoh on it march
now pharaoh turn to the wander and said
thou hast not yet answer my messag that rei carri to thee thi
morn wilt thou take servic with me and be a captain in thi war
the wander littl like the name of servic but hi warlik heart wa
stir within him for he love the delight of battl but befor he
could answer yea or nai meriamun the queen who wa not mind that he
should leav her spoke hastili
thi is my counsel meneptah that the lord eperitu should abid here
in tani and be the captain of my guard while thou art gone to smite the
apura for i mai not be here unguard in these troublou time and if
i know he watch over me he who is so mighti a man then i shall walk
safe and sleep in peac
now the wander bethought him of hi desir to look upon the hathor
for to see new thing and try new adventur wa alwai hi delight so
he answer that if it were pleas to pharaoh and the queen he would
willingli stai and command the guard and pharaoh said that it should be
so
iv
the queen chamber
at middai on the morrow pharaoh and the host of pharaoh march in pomp
from tani take the road that run across the desert countri toward
the red sea of weed the wai that the apura had gone the wander went
with the armi for an hour journei and more in a chariot driven by
rei the priest for rei did not march with the host the number of
the soldier of pharaoh amaz the achan accustom to the levi of
barren isl and scatter tribe but he said noth of hi wonder
to rei or ani man lest it should be thought that he came from among a
littl peopl he even made as if he held the armi lightli and ask
the priest if thi wa all the strength of pharaoh then rei told him
that it wa but a fourth part for none of the mercenari and none of
the soldier from the upper land march with the king in pursuit of the
apura
then the wander knew that he wa come among a greater peopl than he
had ever encount yet on land or sea so he went with them till the
road divid and there he drove hi chariot to the chariot of pharaoh
and bade him farewel pharaoh call to him to mount hi own chariot
and spake thu to him
swear to me thou wander who namest thyself eperitu though of what
countri thou art and what wa thy father hous none know swear to me
that thou wilt guard meriamun the queen faithfulli and wilt work no woe
upon me nor open my hous while i am afar great thou art and beauti
to look on ay and strong enough beyond the strength of men yet my
heart misdoubt me of thee for methink thou art a crafti man and that
evil will come upon me through thee
if thi be thy mind pharaoh said the wander leav me not in
guard of the queen and yet methink i did not befriend thee so ill two
night gone when the rabbl would have put thee and all thy hous to
the sword becaus of the death of the firstborn
now pharaoh look on him long and doubtfulli then stretch out hi
hand the wander took it and swore by hi own god by zeu by
aphrodit and athen and apollo that he would be true to the trust
i believ thee wander said pharaoh know thi if thou keepest
thine oath thou shalt have great reward and thou shalt be second
to none in the land of khem but if thou failest then thou shalt die
miser
i ask no fee answer the wander and i fear no death for in on
wai onli shall i die and that is known to me yet i will keep my oath
and he bow befor pharaoh and leap from hi chariot enter again
into the chariot of rei
now as he drove back through the host the soldier call to him
sai
leav us not wander for he look so gloriou in hi golden armour
that it seem to them as though a god depart from their rank
hi heart wa with them for he love war and he did not love the
apura but he drove on as so it must be and came to the palac at
sundown
that night he sat at the feast by the side of meriamun the queen and
when the feast wa done she bade him follow her into her chamber where
she sat when she would be alon it wa a fragrant chamber dimli
light with sweetscent lamp furnish with couch of ivori and
gold while all the wall told paint stori of strang god and
king and of their love and war the queen sank back upon the
embroid cushion of a couch and bade the wise odysseu to sit guard
over against her so near that her robe swept hi golden greav thi
he did somewhat against hi will though he wa no hater of fair women
but hi heart misdoubt the darkei queen and he look upon her
guardedli for she wa strang fair to see the fairest of all mortal
women whom he had known save the golden helen
wander we ow thee great thank and i would gladli know to whom
we ar in debt for the price of our live she said tell me of thy
birth of thy father hous and of the land that thou hast seen and
the war wherein thou hast fought tell me also of the sack of ilio
and how thou camest by thy golden mail the unhappi pari wore such arm
as these if the minstrel of the north sang truth
now the wander would gladli have curs thi minstrel of the north
and hi song
minstrel will be ly ladi he said and thei gather old tale
wherev thei go pari mai have worn my arm or anoth man i bought
them from a chapman in crete and ask noth of their first master
as for ilio i fought there in my youth and serv the cretan
idomeneu but i got littl booti to the king the wealth and women to

meriamun listen to hi tale which he set forth roughli as if he were
some blunt grumbl swordsman and darkli she look on him while she
hearken and darkli she smile as she look
a strang stori eperitu a strang stori truli now tell me thu how
camest thou by yonder great bow the bow of the swallow string if my
minstrel spoke truli it wa onc the bow of eurytu of oechalia
now the wander glanc round him like a man taken in ambush who see
on everi hand the sword of foe shine up into the sunlight
the bow ladi he answer readili enough i got it strang i
wa cruis with a cargo of iron on the western coast and land on an
isl methink the pilot call it ithaca there we found noth but
death a pestil had been in the land but in a ruin hall thi bow
wa ly and i made prize of it a good bow
a strang stori trulya veri strang stori quoth meriamun the
queen by chanc thou didst bui the armour of pari by chanc thou
didst find the bow of eurytu that bow methink with which the
godlik odysseu slew the wooer in hi hall knowest thou eperitu
that when thou stoodest yonder on the board in the place of banquet
when the great bow twang and the long shaft hail down on the hall
and loosen the knee of mani not a littl wa i put in mind of the
song of the slai of the wooer at the hand of odysseu the fame of
odysseu ha wander farai even to khem and she look straight at
him
the wander darken hi face and put the matter by he had heard
someth of that tale he said but deem it a minstrel feign
on man could not fight a hundr as the stori went
the queen half rose from the couch where she lai curl up like a
glitter snake like a snake she rose and watch him with her
melancholi ey
strang indeedmost strang that odysseu laert son odysseu
of ithaca should not know the tale of the slai of the wooer by
odysseu self strang inde thou eperitu who art odysseu
now the neck of the wander wa in the noos and well he knew it yet
he kept hi counsel and look upon her vacantli
men sai that thi odysseu wander year ago into the north and that
thi time he will not come again i saw him in the war and he wa a
taller man than i said the wander
i have alwai heard said the queen that odysseu wa doubletongu
and crafti as a fox look me in the ey thou wander look me in the
ey and i will show thee whether or not thou art odysseu and she
lean forward so that her hair wellnigh swept hi brow and gaze deep
into hi ey
now the wander wa asham to drop hi ey befor a woman and he
could not rise and go so he must need gaze and as he gaze hi head
grew strang light and the blood quiver in hi vein and then
seem to stop
now turn thou wander said the voic of the queen and to him it
sound far awai as if there wa a wall between them and tell me what
thou seest
so he turn and look toward the dark end of the chamber but
present through the dark stole a faint light like the first grei
light of the dawn and now he saw a shape like the shape of a great
hors of wood and behind the hors were black squar tower of huge
stone and gate and wall and hous now he saw a door open in the
side of the hors and the helmet head of a man look out wearili as
he look a great white star slid down the sky so that the light of
it rest on the face of the man and that face wa hi own then he
rememb how he had look forth from the belli of the wooden hors as
it stood within the wall of ilio and thu the star had seem to fall
upon the doom citi an omen of the end of troi
look again said the voic of meriamun from far awai
so onc more he look into the dark and there he saw the mouth of
a cave and beneath two palm in front of it sat a man and a woman
the yellow moon rose and it light fell upon a sleep sea upon tall
tree upon the cave and the two who sat there the woman wa love
with braid hair and clad in a shine robe and her ey were dim
with tear that she might never shed for she wa a goddess calypso
the daughter of atla then in the vision the man look up and hi
face wa weari and worn and sick for home but it wa hi own face
then he rememb how he had sat thu at the side of calypso of the
braid tress on that last night of all hi night in her wavegirt
isl the centr of the sea
look onc more said the voic of meriamun the queen
again he look into the dark there befor him grew the ruin of
hi own hall in ithaca and in the courtyard befor the hall wa a heap
of ash and the char bone of men befor the heap lai the figur
of on lost in sorrow for hi limb writh upon the ground anon the
man lift hi face and behold the wander knew that it wa hi own
face
then of a sudden the gloom pass awai from the chamber and onc more
hi blood surg through hi vein and there befor him sat meriamun
the queen smile darkli
strang sight hast thou seen is it not so wander she said
yea queen the most strang of sight tell me of thy courtesi how
thou didst conjur them befor my ey
by the magic that i have eperitu i abov all wizard who dwell in
khem the magic wherebi i can read all the past of thosei love and
again she look upon him ay and call it forth from the storehous of
dead time and make it live again sai whose face wa it that thou didst
look uponwa it not the face of odysseu of ithaca laert son and
wa not that face thine
now the wander saw that there wa no escap therefor he spoke the
truth not becaus he love it but becaus he must
the face of odysseu of ithaca it wa that i saw befor me ladi and
that face is mine i avow myself to be odysseu laert son and no
other man
the queen laugh aloud great must be my strength of magic she
said for it can strip the guil from the subtlest of men henceforth
odysseu thou wilt know that the ey of meriamun the queen see far
now tell me truli what camest thou hither to seek
the wander took swift counsel with himself rememb that dream of
meriamun of which rei the priest had told him and which she knew not
that he had learn the dream that show her the vision of on whom
she must love and rememb the word of the dead hataska he grew
afraid for he saw well by the token of the spear point that he wa
the man of her dream and that she knew it but he could not accept
her love both becaus of hi oath to pharaoh and becaus of her whom
aphrodit had shown to him in ithaca her whom alon he must seek the
heart desir the golden helen
the strait wa desper between a broken oath and a woman scorn but
he fear hi oath and the anger of zeu the god of host and guest
so he sought safeti beneath the wing of truth
ladi he said i will tell thee all i came to ithaca from the white
north where a curs had driven me i came and found my hall desol
and my peopl dead and the veri ash of my wife but in a dream of
the night i saw the goddess whom i have worship littl aphrodit of
idalia whom in thi land ye name hathor and she bade me go forth and
do her will and for reward she promis me that i should find on who
wait me to be my deathless love
meriamun heard him so far but no further for of thi she made sure
that she wa the woman whom aphrodit had promis to the wander
er he might speak anoth word she glide to him like a snake and like
a snake curl herself about him then she spoke so low that he rather
knew her thought than heard her word
wa it inde so odysseu did the goddess inde send thee to seek me
out know then that not to thee alon did she speak i also look for
thee i also wait the come of on whom i should love oh heavi have
been the dai and empti wa my heart and sore through the year have
i long for him who should be brought to me and now at length it is
done now at length i see him whom in my dream i saw and she lift
her lip to the lip of the wander and her heart and her ey and
her lip said love
but it wa not for noth that he bore a stout and patient heart and a
brain uncloud by danger or by love he had never been in a strait like

broken oath and the loss for ever of the heart desir for to love

v
the chapel peril
swift as a bird or a thought sai the old harper of the northern sea
the wander thought in the morn were swift as night bird fly
back and brood over the thing he had seen and the word he had heard
in the queen chamber again he stood between thi woman and the oath
which of all oath wa the worst to break and inde he wa littl
tempt to break it for though meriamun wa beauti and wise he
fear her love and he fear her magic art no less than he fear her
vengeanc if she were scorn delai seem the onli cours let him
wait till the king return and it would go hard but he found some
caus for leav the citi of tani and seek through new adventur
the world desir the mysteri river lai yonder he would ascend the
river of which so mani tale were told it flow from the land of the
blameless thiopian the most just of men at whose tabl the veri
god sat as guest there perchanc far up the sacr stream in a
land where no wrong ever came there if the fate permit he might
find the golden helen
if the fate permit but all the adventur wa of the fate who had
shown him to meriamun in a dream
he turn it long in hi mind and found littl light it seem that as
he had drift through dark across a bloodr sea to the shore of
khem so he should wade through blood to that shore of fate which the
god appoint
yet after a while he shook sorrow from him aros bath anoint
himself comb hi dark lock and gird on hi golden armour for now
he rememb that thi wa the dai when the strang hathor should stand
upon the pylon of the templ and call the peopl to her and he wa
mind to look upon her and if need be to do battl with that which
guard her
so he prai to aphrodit that she would help him and he pour out
wine to her and wait he wait but no answer came to hi prayer
yet as he turn awai it chanc that he saw hi counten in the wide
golden cup whenc he had pour and it seem to him that it had grown
more fair and lost the stamp of year and that hi face wa smooth and
young as the face of that odysseu who mani year ago had sail in
the black ship and look back on the smoke ruin of windi troi in
thi he saw the hand of the goddess and knew that if she might not
be manifest in thi land of strang god yet she wa with him and
know thi hi heart grew light as the heart of a boi from whom
sorrow is yet a long wai off and who ha not dream of death
then he at and drank and when he had put from him the desir of food
he aros and gird on the sword euryaluss gift but the black bow he
left in it case now he wa readi and about to set forth when rei the
priest enter the chamber
whither goest thou eperitu ask rei the instruct priest and
what is it that ha made thy face so fair as though mani year had been
lift from thy back

thu he spake as though he believ the wander but in hi heart he
knew that the thing wa of the god

and not otherwis never shall it be told he murmur in hi heart
that he who stood in arm against scylla the horror of the rock

then rei wrung hi hand and went nigh to weep for to him it seem
a piti thing that so goodli a man and so great a hero should thu
be done to death but the wander pass out through the citi and rei
went with him for a certain distanc at length thei came to the road
set on either side with sphinx that lead from the outer wall of
brick to the garden of the templ of hathor and down thi road hurri
a multitud of men of all race and of everi ag here the princ
wa born along in hi litter here the young nobl travel in hi
chariot here came the slave bespatt with the mud of the field
here the crippl limp upon hi crutch and here wa the blind man
led by a hound and with each man came women the wife of the man or
hi mother or hi sister or she to whom he wa vow in marriag
weep thei came and with soft word and cling arm thei strove to
hold back him whom thei love

but go not thou up to thy death it is no goddess whom thou wilt see
but an evil spirit loos from the underworld and that shall be thy
doom oh if i pleas thee not take thou anoth wife and i will make
her welcom onli go not up to thy death
but the man fix hi ey upon the pylon top heed her not and at
length she sank upon the road and there with the babe would have been
crush by the chariot had not the wander born her to on side of
the wai
now of all sight thi wa the most dread for on everi side rose
the prayer and lament of women and still the multitud of men
press on unheed
now thou seest the power of love and how if a woman be but beauti
enough she mai drag all men to ruin said rei the priest
ye said the wander a strang sight truli much blood hath thi
hathor of thine upon her hand
and yet thou wilt give her thine wander
that i am not mind to do he answer yet i will look upon her
face so speak no more of it
now thei were come to the space befor the bronz gate of the pylon of
the outer court and there the multitud gather to the number of mani
hundr present as thei watch a priest came to the gate
that same priest who had shown the wander the bodi in the bath of
bronz he look through the bar and cri aloud
whoso would enter into the court and look upon the holi hathor let him
draw nigh know ye thi all men the hathor is to him who can win her
but if he pass not then shall he die and be buri within the templ
nor shall he ever look upon the sun again of thi ye ar warn sinc
the hathor came again to khem of men seven hundr and three have gone
to win her and of bodi seven hundr and two lie within the vault
for of all these men pharaoh meneptah alon hath gone back live yet
there is place for more enter ye who would look upon the hathor
now there aros a mighti wail from the women thei clung madli about
the neck of those who were dear to them and some clung not in vain
for the heart of mani fail them at the last and thei shrank from
enter in but a few of those who had alreadi look upon the hathor
from afar perchanc a score in all struck the women from them and
rush up to the gate
sure thou wilt not enter in quoth rei cling to the arm of the
wander oh turn thy back on death and come back with me i prai thee

nai said the wander i will go in
then rei the priest threw dust upon hi head wept aloud and turn and
fled never stop till he came to the palac where sat meriamun the
queen
now the priest unbar a wicket in the gate of bronz and on by on
those who were stricken of the mad enter in for all of these
had seen the hathor mani time from afar without the wall and now thei
could no more withstand their long and as thei enter two other
priest took them by the hand and bound their ey with cloth so that
unless thei will it thei might not see the glori of the hathor but
onli hear the sweet of her voic but two there were who would not
be blindfold and of these on wa that man whose wife had faint by
the wai and the other wa a man sightless from hi youth for although
he might not see the beauti of the goddess thi man wa made mad by the
sweet of her voic now when all had enter in save the
wander there wa a stir in the crowd and a man rush up he wa
travelstain he had a black beard black ey and a nose hook like
a vultur beak

and dai have i journei leav wife and flock and children and the
promis of the land that i mai onc more look upon the beauti of the
hathor shut not the gate
pass in said the priest pass in so shall we be rid of on of those
whom khem nurtur up to rob her
he enter then as the priest wa about to bar the wicket the
wander strode forward and hi golden armour clash beneath the
portal
wouldst thou inde enter to thy doom thou mighti lord ask the
priest for he knew him well again
ay i enter but perchanc not to my doom answer the wander then
he pass in and the brazen gate wa shut behind him
now the two priest came forward to bind hi ey but thi he would not
endur
not so he said i am come here to see what mai be seen
go to thou madman go to and die the death thei answer and led
all the men to the centr of the courtyard whenc thei might see
the pylon top then the priest also cover up their ey and cast
themselv at length upon the ground so for a while thei lai and all
wa silenc within and without the court for thei wait the come
of the hathor the wander glanc through the bar of bronz at the
multitud gather there silent thei stood with upturn ey even the
women had ceas from weep and stood in silenc he look at those
besid him their bandag face were lift and thei stare toward the
pylon top as though their vision pierc the cloth the blind man too
stare upward and hi pale lip move but no sound came from them now
at the foot of the pylon lai a littl rim of shadow thinner and thinner
it grew as the moment crept on toward the perfect noon now there wa
but a line and now the line wa gone for the sun red disc burn
high in the blue heaven straight abov the pylon brow then suddenli and
from afar there came a faint sweet sound of sing and at the first
note of the sound a great sigh went up through the quiet air from all
the multitud without those who were near the wander sigh also and
their lip and finger twitch and he himself sigh though he knew
not why
nearer came the sweet sound of sing and stronger it swell till
present those without the templ gate who were on higher ground caught
sight of her who sang then a hoars roar went up from everi throat and
mad took them on thei rush dash themselv against the gate
of bronz and the steep wall on either side and beat upon them madli
with their fist and brow and climb on each other shoulder
gnaw at the bar with their teeth cry to be let in but the women
threw their arm about them and scream curs on her whose beauti
brought all men to mad
so it went for a while till present the wander look up and lo
upon the pylon brow stood the woman self and at her come all were
onc more silent she wa tall and straight clad in cling white
but on her breast there glow a bloodr rubi stone fashion like
a star and from it fell red drop that stain for on moment the
white of her robe and then the robe wa white again her golden
hair wa toss thi wai and that and shone in the sunlight her arm
and neck were bare and she held on hand befor her ey as though to
hide the bright of her beauti for inde she could not be call
beauti but beauti itself
and thei who had not love saw in her that first love whom no man ha
ever won and thei who had love saw that first love whom everi man ha
lost and all about her roll a glorylik the glori of the dy dai
sweetli she sang a song of promis and her voic wa the voic of each
man desir and the heart of the wander thrill in answer to it as
thrill a harp smitten by a cun hand and thu she sang
whom hast thou long for most
true love of mine
whom hast thou love and lost
lo she is thine
she that anoth wed
break from her vow
she that hath long been dead
wake for thee now
dream haunt the hapless bed
ghost haunt the night
life crown her live head
love and delight
nai not a dream nor ghost
nai but divin
she that wa love and lost
wait to be thine
she ceas and a moan of desir went up from all who heard
then the wander saw that those besid him tore at the bandag about
their brow and rent them loos onli the priest who lai upon the
ground stir not though thei also moan
and now again she sang still hold her hand befor her face
ye that seek me ye that sue me
ye that flock beneath my tower
ye would win me would undo me
i must perish in an hour
dead befor the love that slew me clasp the
bride and crush the flower
hear the word and mark the warn
beauti live but in your sight
beauti fade from all men scorn
in the watch of the night
beauti wane befor the morn and
love di in hi delight
she ceas and onc more there wa silenc then suddenli she bent
forward across the pylon brow so far that it seem that she must fall
and stretch out her arm as though to clasp those beneath show all
the glori of her loveli
the wander look then drop hi ey as on who ha seen the
bright of the noondai sun in the dark of hi mind the world wa
lost and he could think of naught save the clamour of the peopl which
fret hi ear thei were all cry and none were listen
see see shout on look at her hair it is dark as the raven

vi
the warden of the gate
the clamour swell or sank and the men call or cri the name
of mani women some dead some lost other were mute silent in the
presenc of the world desir silent as when we see lost face in
a dream the wander had look onc and then cast down hi ey and
stood with hi face hidden in hi hand he alon wait and strove to
think the rest were abandon to the bewilder of their passion and
their amaz
what wa it that he had seen that which he had sought hi whole life
long sought by sea and land not know what he sought for thi he
had wander with a hungri heart and now wa the hunger of hi heart
to be appeas between him and her wa the unknown barrier and the
invis death wa he to pass the unmark boundari to forc those
guard gate and achiev where all had fail had a magic deceiv hi
ey did he look but on a pictur and a vision that some art could call
again from the haunt place of memori
he sigh and look again lo in hi charm sight a fair girl seem
to stand upon the pylon brow and on her head she bore a shine urn of
bronz
he knew her now he had seen her thu at the court of king tyndareu as
he drove in hi chariot through the ford of eurota thu he had seen
her also in the dream on the silent isl
again he sigh and again he look now in hi charm sight a woman
sat whose face wa the face of the girl grown more love far but sad
with grief and touch with shame
he saw her and he knew her so he had seen her in troi tower when he
stole thither in a beggar guis from the camp of the achan so he
had seen her when she save hi life in ilio
again he sigh and again he look and now he saw the golden helen
she stood upon the pylon brow she stood with arm outstretch
with ey upturn and on her shine face there wa a smile like the
infinit smile of the dawn oh now inde he knew the shape that wa
beauti selfth innoc spirit of love sent on earth by the undi
god to be the doom and the delight of men to draw them through the
wai of strife to the unknown end
awhil the golden helen stood thu look up and out to the world
beyond to the peac beyond the strife to the goal beyond the grave
thu she stood while men scarc dare to breath summon all to come
and take that which upon the earth is guard so invinc
then onc more she sang and as she sang slowli drew herself awai till
at length noth wa left of the vision of her save the sweet of
her dy song
who win hi love shall lose her
who lose her shall gain
for still the spirit woo her
a soul without a stain
and memori still pursu her
with long not in vain
he lose her who gain her
who watch dai by dai
the dust of time that stain her
the grief that leav her grei
the flesh that yet enchain her
whose grace hath pass awai
oh happier he who gain not
the love some seem to gain
the joi that custom stain not
shall still with him remain
the loveli that wane not
the love that neer can wane
in dream she grow not older
the land of dream among
though all the world wax colder
though all the song be sung
in dream doth he behold her
still fair and kind and young
now the silenc di awai and again mad came upon those who
had listen and look the men without the wall onc more hurl
themselv against the gate while the women clung to them shriek
curs on the beauti of the hathor for the song meant noth to these
women and their arm were about those whom thei love and who won them
their bread but most of the men who were in the outer court rush
up to the inner gate within which stood the alabast shrine of the
hathor some flung themselv upon the ground and clutch at it as
in dream men fling themselv down to be save from fall into a pit
that ha no bottom yet as in such an evil slumber the dreamer is
drawn inch by inch to the mouth of the pit by an unseen hand so these
wretch men were drag along the ground by the might of their
own desir in vain thei set their feet against the stone to hold
themselv from go for thei thrust forward yet more fierc
with their hand and thu littl by littl drew near the inner gate
writh forward yet move backward like a wound snake drag
along by a rope for of those who thu enter the outer court and
look upon the hathor few might go back aliv
now the priest drew the cloth from their ey and rise flung
wide the second gate and there but a littl wai off the veil of the
shrine waver as if in a wind for now the door beyond the veil were
thrown open as might be seen when the wind swai it tyrian web and
through the curtain came the sound of the same sweet sing
draw near draw near cri the ancient priest let him who would win
the hathor draw near
now at first the wander wa mind to rush on but hi desir had not
wholli overcom him nor had hi wisdom left him he took counsel with
hi heart and wait to let the other go and to see how it fare with
them
the worshipp were now hurri back and now dart onward as fear
and long seiz them till the man who wa blind drew near led by
the hand of a priest for hi hound might not enter the second court of
the templ
do ye fear he cri coward i fear not it is better to look upon
the glori of the hathor and die than to live and never see her more set
my face straight ye priest set my face straight at the worst i can
but die
so thei led him as near the curtain as thei dare to go and set hi
face straight then with a great cry he rush on but he wa caught and
whirl about like a leaf in a wind so that he fell he rose and again
rush on again to be whirl back a third time he rose and rush
on smite with hi blind man staff the blow fell and stai in
midair and there came a hollow sound as of a smitten shield and the
staff that dealt the blow wa shatter then there wa a nois like the
nois of clash sword and the man instantli sank down dead though
the wander could see no wound upon him
draw near draw near cri the priest again thi on is fallen let
him who would win the hathor draw near
then the man who had fled from the host of the apura rush forward
cry on the lion of hi tribe back he wa hurl and back again but
at the third time onc more there came the sound of clash sword and
he too fell dead
draw near draw near cri the priest anoth ha fallen let him
who would win the hathor draw near
and now man after man rush on to be first hurl back and then slain
of the clash sword and at length all were slain save the wander
alon
then the priest spake
wilt thou inde rush on to doom thou gloriou man thou hast seen the
fate of mani be warn and turn awai
never did i turn from man or ghost said the wander and draw
hi short sword he came near warili cover hi head with hi broad
shield while the priest stood back to see him die now the wander
had mark that none were touch till thei stood at the veri threshold
of the doorwai therefor he utter a prayer to aphrodit and came on
slowli till hi feet were within a bow length of the threshold and
there he stood and listen now he could hear the veri word of the
song that the hathor sang as she wove at her loom so dread and sweet
it wa that for a while he thought no more on the guardian of the gate
nor of how he might win the wai nor of aught save the song for she
wa sing shrill and clear in hi own dear tongu the tongu of the
achan
paint with thread of gold and scarlet paint the battl fought
for me
all the war for argiv helen storm and sack by land or sea
all the tale of love and sorrow that have been and ar to be
paint her lip that like a cup have pledg the lip of hero all
paint her golden hair unwhiten while the mani winter fall
paint the beauti that is mistress of the wide world and it thrall
paint the storm of ship and chariot rain of arrow fly far
paint the wave of warfar leap up at beauti like a star
like a star that pale and trembl hang abov the wave of war
paint the ancient ilio fallen paint the flame that scale the
sky
when the foe wa in the fortress when the trumpet and the cry
rang of men in their last onset men whose hour had dawn to die
woe for me onc love of all men me that never yet have known
how to love the heart that love me woe for woe who hear
the moan
of my lover ghost that perish in their citi overthrown
is there not of god or mortal oh ye god is there not on
on whose heart shall mate with my heart on to love er all be
done
all the tale of war that shall be for my love beneath the sun
now the song di awai and the wander onc more bethought him of the
warden of the gate and of the battl which he must fight but as
he brace himself to rush on against the unseen foe the music of the
sing swell forth again and whether he will it or will it not
so sweet wa it magic that there he must wait till the song wa done
and now stronger and more gladli rang the sweet shrill voic like the
voic of on who ha made moan through the livelong winter night and
now see the chariot of the dawn climb the eastern sky and thu the
hathor sang
ah within my heart a hunger for the love unfelt unknown
stir at length and wake and murmur as a child that wake to
moan
left to sleep within some silent hous of stranger and alon
so my heart awak and wake moan with hunger and with cold
cri in pain of dim remembr for the joi that wa of old
for the love that wa that shall be half forgot and half
foretold
have i dream it or rememb in anoth world wa i
live and love in alien season move beneath a golden sky
in a golden clime where never came the strife of men that die
but the god themselv were jealou for our bliss wa over great
and thei brought on us divis and the horror of their hate
and thei set the snake between us and the twine coil of fate
and thei said go forth and seek each other face and onli find
shadow of that face ye long for dream of dai left far behind
love the shadow and be love with love that waver as the wind
onc more the sweet sing di awai but as the wander grasp hi
sword and fix the broad shield upon hi arm he rememb the dream
of meriamun the queen which had been told him by rei the priest for in
that dream twain who had sin were made three and through mani death
and live must seek each other face and now it seem that the burden
of the song wa the burden of the dream
then he thought no more on dream or song or omen but onli on the
deadli foe that stood befor him wrap in dark and on helen in
whose arm he yet should lie for so the goddess had sworn to him in
seagirt ithaca he spoke no word he name no god but sprang forward
as a lion spring from hi bed of reed and lo hi buckler clash
against shield that bar the wai and invis arm seiz him to
hurl him back but no weakl wa the wander thu to be push asid
by magic but the stoutest man left aliv in the whole world now that
aia telamon son wa dead the priest wonder as thei saw how he
gave back never a step for all the might of the warden of the gate
but lift hi short sword and hew down so terribl that fire leapt
from the air where the short sword fell the good short sword of
euryalu the phacian then came the clash of the sword and from
all the golden armour that onc the godlik pari wore ay from
buckler helm and greav and breastplat the spark stream up as
thei stream from the anvil of the smith when he smite great blow on
sword made white with fire
swift as hail fell the blow of the unseen blade upon the golden
armour but he who wore it took no harm nor wa it so much as mark
with the dint of the sword so while the priest wonder at thi
miracl the viewless warden of the gate smote at the wander and the
wander smote at them again then of a sudden he knew thi that thei
who bar the path were gone for no more blow fell and hi sword
onli cut the air
then he rush on and pass behind the veil and stood within the
shrine
but as the curtain swung behind him the sing rose again upon the
air and he might not move but stood fix with hi ey gaze where
far up a loom wa set within the shrine for the sound of the sing
came from behind the great web gleam in the loom the sound of the
song of helen as she heard the sword clash and the ring of the
har of those whose knee were loosen in death it wa thu she
sang
clamour of iron on iron and shriek of steel upon steel
hark how thei echo again
life with the dead is at war and the mortal ar shaken and reel
the live ar slain by the slain
clamour of iron on iron like music that chime with a song
so with my life doth it chime
and my footstep must fall in the danc of erinni a revel of
wrong
till the dai of the pass of time
ghost of the dead that have love me your love have been
vanquish of death
but unvanquish of death is your hate
sai is there none that mai woo me and win me of all that draw
breath
not on but is envi of fate
now the song di and the wander look up and befor him stood
three shadow of mighti men clad in armour he gaze upon them and he
knew the blazon paint on their shield he knew them for hero long
deadpirith theseu and aia
thei look upon him and then cri with on voic
hail to thee odysseu of ithaca son of laert

hous of hade

sent forth by queen persephon to be the guard of the beauti of helen
hail to thee pirith ixion son cri the wander again hast
thou yet won the dread persephon to be thy love and why doth hade
give hi rival holidai to wander in the sunlight for of old i sought
thee and found thee not in the hous of hade
then the semblanc of pirith answer

forgotten thy wrath against me for the sake of those accurs arm that
i won from thee the arm of achil son of peleu for of old in the
hous of hade i spoke to thee but thou wouldst not answer on word so
heavi wa thine anger
then the semblanc of aia made answer with iron upon iron and the
stroke of bronz on bronz would i answer thee if i were yet a live
man and look upon the sunlight but i smite with a shadowi spear and
slai none but men foredoom and i am the shade of aia who dwell in

then the wander spake
tell me ye shadow of the son of hero is the wai close and do
the god forbid it or mai i that am yet a live man pass forward and
gaze on that ye guard on the beauti of helen
then each of the three nod with hi head and smote onc upon hi
shield sai
pass by but look not back upon us till thou hast seen thy desir
then the wander went by into the innermost chamber of the alabast
shrine
now when the shadow had spoken thu thei grew dim and vanish and
the wander as thei had command drew slowli up on the alabast
shrine till at length he stood on the hither side of the web upon
the loom it wa a great web wide and high and hid all the innermost
recess of the shrine here he wait not know how he should break
in upon the hathor
as he stood wonder thu hi buckler slip from hi loosen hand
and clash upon the marbl floor and as it clash the voic of the
hathor took up the broken song and thu she sang ever more sweetli
ghost of the dead that have love me your love ha been
vanquish by death
but unvanquish by death is your hate
sai is there none that mai woo me and win me of all that draw
breath
not on but is envi of fate
none that mai pass you unwound unscath of invis spear
by the splendour of zeu there is on
and he come and my spirit is touch as demet is touch by the
tear
of the spring and the kiss of the sun
for he come and my heart that wa chill as a lake in the season
of snow
is molten and glow as with fire
and the love that i knew not is born and he laugh in my heart
and i know
the name and the flame of desir
as a flame i am kindl a flame that is blown by a wind from the
north
by a wind that is deadli with cold
and the hope that awok in me faint for the love that is born
shall go forth
to my love and shall die as of old
now the song sob itself awai but the heart of the wander echo to
it sweet as a lyre moan and thrill when the hand of the striker
is lift from the string
for a while he stood thu hidden by the web upon the loom while hi
limb shook like the leav of the tall poplar and hi face turn
white as turn the poplar leav then desir overcam him and a long
he could not master to look upon the face of her who sang and he
seiz the web upon the loom and rent it with a great rend nois so
that it fell down on either side of him and the gold coil rippl at
hi feet
vii
the shadow in the sunlight
the torn web fellth last veil of the strang hathor it fell and all
it unravel thread of glitter gold and scarlet rippl and coil
about the wander feet and about the pillar of the loom
the web wa torn the veil wa rent the labour wa lost the pictur
stori of love and war wa all undon
but there white in the silveri dusk of the alabast shrine there wa
the visibl helen the bride and the daughter of mysteri the world
desir
there shone that fabl loveli of which no stori wa too strang of
which all miracl seem true there her hand fold on her lap her
head bowedther sat she whose voic wa the echo of all sweet voic
she whose shape wa the mirror of all fair form she whose chang
beauti so thei said wa the child of the chang moon
helen sat in a chair of ivori gleam even through the sunshin of her
outspread hair she wa cloth in soft fold of white on her breast
gleam the starston the red stone of the seadeep that melt in the
sunshin but that melt not on the breast of helen moment by moment
the red drop from the rubi heart of the star fell on her snowi raiment
fell and vanishedfel and vanishedand left no stain
the wander look on her face but the beauti and the terror of it as
she rais it were more than he could bear and he stood like those who
saw the terror and the beauti of that face which chang men to stone
for the love ey of helen stare wide her lip yet quiver with
the last note of song were wide open in fear she seem like on who
walk alon and suddenli in the noondai light meet the hate dead
encount the ghost of an enemi come back to earth with the instant
summon of doom
for a moment the sight of her terror made even the wander afraid what
wa the horror she beheld in thi haunt shrine where wa none save
themselv alon what wa with them in the shrine
then he saw that her ey were fix on hi golden armour which pari
onc had worn on the golden shield with the blazon of the white bull
on the golden helm whose visor wa down so that it quit hid hi ey
and hi faceand then at last her voic broke from her
pari pari pari ha death lost hold of thee hast thou come
to drag me back to thee and to shame pari dead pari who gave thee
courag to pass the shadow of men whom on earth thou hadst not dare to
face in war
then she wrung her hand and laugh aloud with the empti laugh of
fear
a thought came into that crafti mind of the wander and he answer
her not in hi own voic but in the smooth soft mock voic of the
traitor pari whom he had heard forswear himself in the oath befor
ilio
so ladi thou hast not yet forgiven pari thou weavest the ancient
web thou singest the ancient songsart thou still unkind as of old
why art thou come back to taunt me she said and now she spoke as if
an old familiar fear and horror were lai hold of her and master
her again after long freedom wa it not enough to betrai me in the
semblanc of my wed lord why dost thou mock
in love all art ar fair he answer in the voic of pari mani
have love thee ladi and thei ar all dead for thy sake and no love
but mine ha been more strong than death there is none to blame us now
and none to hinder troi is down the hero ar white dust onli love
live yet wilt thou not learn ladi how a shadow can love
she had listen with her head bow but now she leap up with blaze
ey and face of fire
begon she said the hero ar dead for my sake and to my shame
but the shame is live yet begon never in life or death shall my
lip touch the fals lip that li awai my honour and the fals face
that wore the favour of my lord
for it wa by shapeshift and magic art as poet tell that pari
first beguil fair helen
then the wander spoke again with the sweet smooth voic of pari son
of priam
as i pass up the shrine where thy glori dwell helen i heard thee
sing and thou didst sing of the wake of thy heart of the aris of
love within thy soul and of the come of on for whom thou dost wait
whom thou didst love long sinc and shalt love for ever more and as
thou sangest i came i pari who wa thy love and who am thy love
and who alon of ghost and men shall be thy love again wilt thou still
bid me go
i sang she answer ye as the god put it in my heart so i
sangfor inde it seem to me that on came who wa my love of old
and whom alon i must love alon for ever but thou wast not in my
heart thou fals pari nai i will tell thee and with the name will
scare thee back to hell he wa in my heart whom onc as a maid i saw
drive in hi chariot through the ford of eurota while i bore water
from the well he wa in my heart whom onc i saw in troi when he crept
thither clad in beggar guis ay pari i will name him by hi name
for though he is long dead yet him alon methink i love from the
veri first and him alon i shall love till my deathless is
doneodysseu son of laert odysseu of ithaca he wa name among
men and odysseu wa in my heart as i sang and in my heart he shall
ever be though the god in their wrath have given me to other to my
shame and against my will
now when the wander heard her speak and heard hi own name upon her
lip and knew that the golden helen love him alon it seem to him
as though hi heart would burst hi har no word could he find in
hi heart to speak but he rais the visor of hi helm
she lookedsh saw and knew him for odysseuseven odysseu of ithaca
then in turn she hid her ey with her hand and speak through them
said
oh pari ever wast thou fals but ghost or man of all thy shame
thi is the shamefullest thou hast taken the like of a hero dead
and thou hast heard me speak such word of him as helen never spoke
befor fie on thee pari fie on thee who wouldest trick me into
shame as onc befor thou didst trick me in the shape of menelau who
wa my lord now i will call on zeu to blast thee with hi bolt nai
not on zeu will i call but on odysseu self odysseu odysseu
come thou from the shade and smite thi pari thi trickster who even
in death find wai to mock thee
she ceas and with ey upturn and arm outstretch murmur
odysseu odysseu come
slowli the wander drew near to the glori of the golden helenslowli
slowli he came till hi dark ey look into her ey of blue then at
last he found hi voic and spake
helen argiv helen he said i am no shadow come up from hell to
torment thee and of trojan pari i know noth for i am odysseu
odysseu of ithaca a live man beneath the sunlight hither am i come
to see thee hither i am come to win thee to my heart for yonder in
ithaca aphrodit visit me in a dream and bade me wander out upon the
sea till at length i found thee helen and saw the red star blaze upon
thy breast and i have wander and i have dare and i have heard thy
song and rent the web of fate and i have seen the star and lo at
last at last i find thee well i saw thou knewest the arm of pari
who wa thy husband and to try thee i spoke with the voic of pari
as of old thou didst feign the voic of our wive when we lai in the
wooden hors within the wall of troi thu i drew the sweet of thy
love from thy secret breast as the sun draw out the sweet of the
flower but now i declar myself to be odysseu clad in the mail of
parisodysseu come on thi last journei to be thy love and lord and
he ceas
she trembl and look at him doubtfulli but at last she spoke
well do i rememb she said that when i wash the limb of
odysseu in the hall of ilio i mark a great white scar beneath hi
knee if inde thou art odysseu and not a phantom from the god show
me that great scar
then the wander smile and rest hi buckler against the pillar
of the loom drew off hi golden greav and there wa the scar that the
boar dealt with hi tusk on the parnassian hill when odysseu wa a boi
look ladi he said is thi the scar that onc thine ey look on
in the hall of troi
yea she said it is the veri scar and now i know that thou art no
ghost and no ly shape but odysseu self come to be my love and
lord and she look most sweetli in hi ey
now the wander waver no more but put out hi arm to gather her to
hi heart now the red star wa hidden on hi breast now the red drop
drip from the star upon hi mail and the face of her who is the
world desir grew soft in the shadow of hi helm while her ey were
melt to tear beneath hi kiss the god send all lover like joi
softli she sigh softli drew back from hi arm and her lip were
open to speak when a chang came over her face the kind ey were
full of fear again as she gaze where through the window of the shrine
of alabast the sunlight flicker in gold upon the chapel floor what
wa that which flicker in the sunlight or wa it onli the danc of
the mote in the beam there wa no shadow cast in the sunshin why
did she gaze as if she saw anoth watch thi meet of their love
howev it chanc she master her fear there wa even a smile on her
lip and mirth in her ey as she turn and spoke again
odysseu thou art inde the cunningest of men thou hast stolen my
secret by thy craft who save thee would dream of craft in such an hour
for when i thought thee pari and thy face wa hidden by thy helm i
call on odysseu in my terror as a child cri to a mother methink
i have ever held him dear alwai i have found him readi at need though
the god have will that till thi hour my love might not be known
nai not to my own heart so i call on odysseu and those word were
wrung from me to scare fals pari back to hi own place but the word
that should have driven pari down to hell drew odysseu to my breast
and now it is done and i will not go back upon my word for we have
kiss our kiss of troth befor the immort god have we kiss and
those ghost who guard the wai to helen and whom thou alon couldst
pass as it wa fate ar wit to our oath and now the ghost
depart for no more need thei guard the beauti of helen it is given to
thee to have and keep and now is helen onc more a veri woman for
at thy kiss the curs wa broken ah friend sinc my lord di in
pleasant lacedmon what thing have i seen and suffer by the god
decre but two thing i will tell thee odysseu and thou shalt read
them as thou mayest though never befor in thy lifedai did thy lip
touch mine yet i know that not now for the first time we kiss and thi
i know also for the god have set it in my heart that though our love
shall be short and littl joi shall we have on of anoth yet death
shall not end it for odysseu i am a daughter of the god and though
i sleep and forget that which ha been in my sleep and though my shape
chang as but now it seem to chang in the ey of those ripe to die
yet i die not and for thee though thou art mortal death shall be but
as the short summer night that mark off dai from dai for thou shalt
live again odysseu as thou hast live befor and life by life we
shall meet and love till the end is come
as the wander listen he thought onc more of that dream of meriamun
the queen which the priest rei had told him but he said noth of it
to helen for about the queen and her word to him it seem wisest not
to speak
it will be well to live ladi if life by life i find thee for a love
life by life thou shalt find me odysseu in thi shape or in that
shalt thou find mefor beauti ha mani form and love ha mani
namesbut thou shalt ever find me but to lose me again i tell thee
that as but now thou wonnest thy wai through the rank of those who
watch me the cloud lift from my mind and i rememb and i
foresaw and i knew why i the love of mani might never love in turn
i knew then odysseu that i am but the instrument of the god who us
me for their end and i knew that i love thee and thee onli but with
a love that began befor the birthb and shall not be consum by the
funer flame
so be it ladi said the wander for thi i know that never have
i love woman or goddess as i love thee who art henceforth as the heart
in my breast that without which i mai not live
now speak on she said for such word as these ar like music in my
ear
ay i will speak on short shall be our love thou sayest ladi and my
own heart tell me that it is born to be brief of dai i know that now
i go on my last voyag and that death come upon me from the water
the swiftest death that mai be thi then i would dare to ask when
shall we twain be on for if the hour of life be short let us love
while we mai
now helen golden hair fell befor her ey like the bride veil and
she wa silent for a time then she spoke
not now and not while i dwell in thi holi place mai we be wed
odysseu for so should we call down upon us the hate of god and men
tell me then where thou dwellest in the citi and i will come to thee
nai it is not meet hearken odysseu tomorrow on hour befor the
midnight see that thou dost stand without the pylon gate of thi my
templ then i will pass out to thee as well i mai and thou shalt know
me by the jewel the starston on my breast that shine through the
dark and by that alon and lead me whither thou wilt for then
thou shalt be my lord and i will be thy wife and thereaft as the
god show us so will we go for know it is in my mind to fly thi land
of khem where month by month the god have made the peopl die for me
so till then farewel odysseu my love found after mani dai
it is well ladi answer the wander tomorrow night i meet thee
without the pylon gate i also am mind to fly thi land of witchcraft
and of horror but i mai scarc depart till pharaoh return again for he
ha gone down to battl and left me to guard hi palac
of that we will talk hereaft go now go swiftli for here we mai not
talk more of earthli love said the golden helen
then he took her hand and kiss it and pass from befor her glori as
a man amaz
but in hi foolish wisdom he spoke no word to her of meriamun the queen
viii
the loos of the spirit of rei
rei the priest had fled with what speed he might from the gate of
death those gate that guard the loveli of helen and open onli
upon men doom to die the old man wa heavi at heart for he love
the wander among the dark children of khem he had seen none like thi
achan none so goodli so strong and so well vers in all art of
war he rememb how thi man had save the life of her he love abov
all womenof meriamun the moonchild the fairest queen who had sat
upon the throne of egypt the fairest and the most learn save taia
onli he bethought him of the wander beauti as he stood upon the
board while the long shaft hail down the hall then he recal
the vision of meriamun which she had told him long year ago and the
shadow in a golden helm which watch the chang hataska the more he
thought the more he wa perplex and lost in wonder what did the god
intend of on thing he wa sure the leader of the host of dream had
mock meriamun the man of her vision would never be her love he had
gone to meet hi doom at the door of the chapel peril
so rei hast on stumbl in hi speed till he came to the palac and
pass through it hall toward hi chamber at the entranc of her own
place he met meriamun the queen there she stood in the doorwai like a
pictur in it sculptur frame nor could ani sight be more beauti
than she wa clad in her royal robe and crown with the golden
snake her black hair lai soft and deep on her and her ey look
strang forth from beneath the ivori of her brow
he bow low befor her and would have pass on but she stai him

so he enter and at her command seat himself befor her in the
veri seat where the wander had sat now as he sat thu of a sudden
meriamun the queen slid to her knee befor him and tear were in
her ey and her breast wa shaken with sob and while he wonder
think that she wept at last for her son who wa dead among the
firstborn she hid her face in her hand upon hi knee and trembl
what ail thee queen my fosterl he said but she onli took hi
hand and laid her own in it and the old priest ey were dim with
tear so she sat for awhil and then she look up but still she did
not find word and he caress the beauti imperi head that no
man had seen bow befor what is it my daughter he said and she
answer at last

upon me meriamun hearken rei hearken i love him as it wa fate
i should love when first i look on him as he came up the hall of
audienc in hi glori i knew him i knew him for that man who share
the curs laid aforetim on him and on the woman and on me when in
an unknown place twain becam three and were doom to strive from
life to life and work each other woe upon the earth i knew him rei
though he knew me not and i sai that my soul shook at the echo of hi
step and my heart blossom as the black earth blossom when after
flood sihor seek hi bank again a glori came upon me rei and i
look back through all the mist of time and knew him for my love and
i look forward into the depth of time to be and knew him for my love
then i look on the present hour and naught could i see but dark
and naught could i hear but the groan of dy men and a shrill sound
as of a woman sing

name he hide from us hi own name odysseu laert son odysseu of
ithaca ay thou startest but so it is i learn it by my magic and
wrung the truth even from the guil of the most crafti of men but it
seem to me that he turn from me though thi much i won from him
that he had journei from far to seek me the bride that the god have
promis him
the priest leap up from hi seat ladi he cri ladi whom i
serv and whom i have love from a child thy brain is sick and not

queen of khem and pharaoh wife wilt thou throw thy honour in the mire

over a smitten stag her fierc and love face aliv with rage and
fear
is he dead she hiss in hi ear dead and i knew it not then thou
hast murder him and thu i aveng hi murder
with the word she snatch a dagger from her girdlethat same dagger
with which she had onc struck at meneptah her brother when he would

stai stai he cri it is not i who have slain thi wander if
he inde is dead but hi own folli for he is gone up to look upon the
strang hathor and those who look upon the hathor do battl with the
unseen sword and those who do battl with the unseen sword must lie
in the bath of bronz and seek the under world
the face of meriamun grew white at thi word as the alabast of the
wall and she cri aloud with a great cry then she sank upon the
couch press her hand to her brow and moan
how mai i save him how mai i save him from that accurs witch ala
it is too latebut at least i will know hi end ay and hear of the
beauti of her who slai him rei she whisper not in the speech of

warden i am preparedth knowest the spellsai it
he sank back in the carven couch and look upward then meriamun drew
near to him gaze into hi ey and whisper in hi ear in that dead
tongu she knew and as she whisper the face of rei grew like the face
of on dead she drew back and spoke aloud
art thou loos spirit of rei
then the lip of rei answer her sai i am loos meriamun
whither shall i go
to the court of the templ of hathor that is befor the shrine
it is done meriamun
what seest thou
i see a man clad in golden armour he stand with buckler rais befor
the doorwai of the shrine and befor him ar the ghost of hero dead
though he mai not see them with the ey of the flesh from within the
shrine there come a sound of sing and he listen to the sing
what doe he hear
then the loos spirit of rei the priest told meriamun the queen all the
word of the song that helen sang and when she heard and knew that it
wa argiv helen who sat in the hall of hathor the heart of the queen
grew faint within her and her knee trembl yet more did she trembl
when she learn those word that rang like the word she herself had
heard in her vision long agotel of bliss that had been of the
hate of the god and of the unend quest
now the song end and the wander went up against the ghost and
the spirit of rei speak with the lip of rei told all that befel
while meriamun hearken with open earsai and cri aloud with joi
when the wander forc hi path through the invis sword
then onc more the sweet voic rang and the loos spirit of rei told
the word she sang and to meriamun thei seem fate then he told
her all the talk that pass between the wander and the ghost
now the ghost be gone she bade the spirit of rei follow the wander
up the sanctuari and from the loos spirit she heard how he rent the
web and of all the word of helen and of the craft of him who feign
to be pari then the web wa torn and the ey of the spirit of rei
look on the beauti of her who wa behind it
tell me of the face of the fals hathor said the queen
and the spirit of rei answer her face is that beauti which gather
like a mask upon the face of dead hataska and upon the face of the bai
and the face of the ka when thou spakest with the spirit of her thou
hadst slain
now meriamun groan aloud for she knew that doom wa on her last of
all she heard the tell of the love of odysseu and of helen her
undi foe of their kiss of their betroth and of that marriag
which should be on the morrow night meriamun the queen said never a
word but when all wa done and the wander had left the shrine again
she whisper in the ear of rei the priest and drew back hi spirit to
him so that he awok as a man awak from sleep
he awok and saw the queen sit over against him with a face white as
the face of the dead and about her deep ey were line of black

pass into her bedchamb and there she bade the eunuch suffer none
to enter made fast the door and threw herself down upon the bed
hide her face in it woven cushion thu she lai for mani hour as
on deadtil the dark of the even gather in the chamber but
though she move not yet in her heart there burn a fire now white
with heat as the breath of her passion fan it and now wane black
and dull as the tear fell from her ey for now she knew allthat the
long forebod sometim dread sometim desir and again like
a dream half forgotten wa inde be fulfil she knew of the
devour love that must eat her life awai knew that even in the grave
she should find no rest and her foe wa no longer a face beheld in
a vision but a live woman the fairest and most favour helen of
troi argiv helen the fals hathor the torch that fire great citi
the centr of all desir whose life wa the daili doom of men
meriamun wa beauti but her beauti pale befor the face of helen
as a fire is slain by the sun magic she had also more than ani who
were on the earth but what would her spell avail against the magic of
those chang ey and it wa helen whom the wander came to seek
for her he had travel the wide land and sail the sea but when
he told her of on whom he desir on whom he sought she had deem
that she herself wa that on ay and had told him all
at that thought she laugh out in the mad of her anger and her
shame and he had smile and spoken of pharaoh her lordand the while
he spoke he had thought not on her but of the golden helen now thi
at least she swore that if he might not be her never should he be
helen she would see him dead er that hour ay and herself and if
it might be helen would she see dead also
to what counsel should she turn on the morrow night these two meet on
the morrow night thei would fly togeth then on the morrow must the
wander be slain how should he be slain and leav no tale of murder
by poison he might die and kurri the sidonian should be charg to give
the cup and then she would slai kurri sai that he had poison the
wander becaus of hi hate and the loss of hi good and freedom and
yet how could she slai her love if onc she slew him then she too
must die and seek her joi in the kingdom that osiri rule and there
she might find littl glad
what then should she do no answer came into her heart there wa on
that must answer in her soul
now she rose from the bed and stood for awhil stare into the dark
then she grope her wai to a place where there wa a carven chest of
olivewood and ivori and draw a kei from her girdl she open
the chest within were jewel mirror and unguent in jar of
alabasterai and poison of deadli bane but she touch none of
these thrust her hand deep into the chest she drew forth a casket
of dark metal that the peopl deem unholi a casket made of typhon
bone for so thei call grei iron she press a secret spring it
open and feel within she found a smaller casket lift it to her
lip she whisper over it word of no live speech and in the heavi
and scent dark a low flame flicker and trembl on her lip as she
murmur in the tongu of a dead peopl then slowli the lid open of
itself like a live mouth that open and as it open a gleam of
light stole up from the box into the dusk of the chamber
now meriamun look and shudder as she look yet she put her hand
into the box and mutter come forthcom forth thou ancient evil

thereon she unclasp the bosom of her robe and laid the gleam toi
that seem a snake of stone upon her ivori breast though she trembl
at it ici touch for it wa more cold than death with both her hand
she clasp a pillar of the chamber and so stood and she wa shaken
with throe like the pang of childbirth thu she endur awhil till
that which wa acold grew warm watch it bright that shone
through her silken dress as the flame of a lamp shine through an
alabast vase so she stood for an hour then swiftli put off all her
robe and ornament of gold and loos the dark mass of her hair let
it fall round her like a veil now she bent her head down to her breast
and breath on that which lai upon her breast for the ancient evil

thrice she whisper awak awak awak
and the first time that she breath the thing stir and sparkl the
second time that she breath it undid it shine fold and rear it
head to her the third time that she breath it slid from her bosom

again the thing rear it human head and laugh out in triumph then
slowli it unloos it gleam coil slowli it slid to the earth and
shrank and wither like a flame scroll till at length it seem onc
more but a shine jewel of opal and of amethyst
the wander when he left the inner secret shrine saw no more the
guardian of the gate nor heard the clash of the sword unseen for
the god had given the beauti of helen to odysseu of ithaca as it wa
foretold
without the curtain the priest of the templ were gather
wonderinglittl could thei understand how it came to pass that the
hero who wa call eperitu had vanish through the curtain and had
not been smitten down by the unseen sword and when thei saw him come
forth gloriou and unharm thei cri aloud with fear
but he laugh and said fear not victori is to him whom the god
appoint i have done battl with the warden of the shrine and pass
them and methink that thei ar gone i have look upon the hathor

so thei bow befor him and lead him thenc to their chamber of
banquet gave him of their best and watch him while he at and drank
and put from him the desir of food
then he rose and went from the templ and again the priest bow
befor him moreov thei gave him freedom of the templ and kei
wherebi all the door might be open though littl as thei thought
had he ani need of kei
now the wander walk gladli and light of heart came to hi own
lodg in the court of the palac at the door of the lodg stood
rei the priest who when he saw him ran to him and embrac him so
glad wa he that the wander had escap aliv
littl did i think to look upon thee again eperitu he said had
it not been for that which the queen and he bethought himself and
stai hi speech
nevertheless here i am unhurt of ghost or men the wander
answer laugh as he pass into the lodg but what of the
queen
naught eperitu naught save that she wa griev when she learn
that thou hadst gone up to the templ of the hathor there as she
thought to perish hearken thou eperitu i know not if thou art god
or man but oath ar bind both men and god and thou didst swear an
oath to pharaohi it not so
ay rei i swore an oath that i would guard the queen well till pharaoh
came again
art thou mind to keep that oath eperitu ask rei look on him
strang art thou mind to guard the fair fame of pharaoh queen
that is more preciou than her life methink thou dost understand my
mean eperitu

then rei spake again darkli methink some sick hath smitten
meriamun the queen and she crave thee for her physician now thing
come about as thei were foreshown in the portent of that vision whereof
i spoke to thee but if thou dost break thy oath to him whose salt thou
eatest then eperitu god or man thou art a dastard

answer then sank hi head upon hi breast and commun with hi
crafti heart while rei watch him present he lift up hi head and
spoke

now the wander start to hi feet cry
how knowest thou that name
i know it said rei and i tell thee that i know it thou most crafti
of men to show thi that with me thy guil will not avail thee for
he would not tell him that he had it from the lip of the queen

speech of thi evil helen now justli slain of the angri god
justli slain is she inde answer the crafti wander an ill
thing is it truli that the live of so mani hero should be lost
becaus of the beauti of a faithless woman i had it in my own heart to

reason and thereaft some tri to pass the ghost who guard the
woman and were slain of invis sword it wa a strang sight to
see
a strang sight sure but thou didst not lose thy craft odysseu
nor try to break through the ghost
nai meriamun in my youth i look upon the beauti of argiv helen
who wa fairer than she who stood upon the pylon tower none who have
look upon the helen would seek to win the hathor
but perchanc those who have look upon the hathor mai seek to win

length he rose and bow befor her said that he must visit the guard
that watch the palac gate she look upon him strang and bade

but when the curtain had swung behind him meriamun the queen sprang to
her feet and a dread light of dare burn in her ey she clap
her hand and bade those who came to her seek their rest as she would
also for she wa weari and need none to wait upon her so the women
went leav her alon and she pass into her sleep chamber
now must the bride deck herself for the bridal she said and
straightwai paus not drew forth the ancient evil from it
hidingplac and warm it on her breast breath the breath of life
into it nostril now as befor it grew and wound itself about her
and whisper in her ear bid her cloth herself in bridal white
and clasp the evil around her then think upon the beauti she had seen
gather on the face of dead hataska in the templ of osiri and on the
face of the bai and the face of the ka she did it command fear
noth for her heart wa alight with love and torn with jealou hate
and littl did she reck of the sorrow which her sin should bring forth
so she bath herself in perfum shook out her shine hair and clad
herself in white attir then she look upon her beauti in the mirror
of silver and cri in the bitter of her heart to the evil that lai
besid her like a snake asleep
ah am i not fair enow to win him whom i love sai thou evil must i
inde steal the beauti of anoth to win him whom i love
thi must thou do said the evil or lose him in helen arm for
though thou art fair yet is she beauti self and her gentl

wander goe forth to win the golden helen
then she doubt no more but lift the shine evil held it to her
with a dread laugh it twine itself about her and lo it shrank to
the shape of a girdl doublehead snake of gold with ey of rubi
flame and as it shrank meriamun the queen thought on the beauti she had
seen upon the face of the dead hataska on the face of the bai and the
face of the ka and all the while she watch her beauti in the mirror
and as she watch behold her face grew as the face of death ashen
and hollow then slowli burn into life againbut all her loveli

her deep ey to ey of blue chang wa the glori of her pride to the
sweet of the helen smile fairest among women had been her form
now it wa fairer yet and nownow she wa beauti self and like to

so ah so must the hathor seem she said and lo her voic rang
strang in her ear for the voic too wa chang it wa more soft
than the whisper of windstir reed it wa more sweet than the
murmur of bee at noon
now she must go forth and fear at her own loveli and heavi with
her sin yet glad with a strang joi she pass from her chamber and
glide like a starbeam through the still hall of her palac the white
light of the moon creep into them and fall upon the face of the
dread god on the aw smile of sphinx and the pictur of her
forefath king and queen who long were dead and as she goe she
seem to hear them whisper each to each of the dread sin that she
ha sin and of the sorrow that shall be but she doe not heed and
never stai her foot for her heart is alight as with a flame and she
will win the wander to her armsth wander sought through mani
live found after mani death
now the wander is in hi chamber wait for the hour to set forth
to find the golden helen hi heart is alight and strang dream of
the past go befor hi ey and strang vision of long love to be hi
heart burn like a lamp in the black and by that light he see all
the dai of hi life that have been and all the war that he ha won

bow of eurytu and the grei bolt of death for perchanc the fight is
not yet done he must cleav hi wai to joi then he comb hi lock and
set the golden helm upon them and prai to the god who hear not
he pass from hi chamber
now the chamber open into a great hall of pillar as wa hi custom
when he went alon by night the wander glanc warili down the duski
hall but he might see littl becaus of the shadow nevertheless the
moonlight pour into the centr of the hall from the clerestori in
the roof and lai there shine white as water beneath black bank of
reed again the wander glanc with keen quick ey for there wa a
sens in hi heart that he wa no more alon in the hall though whether
it were man or ghost or perchanc on of the immort god who look
on him he might not tell now it seem to him that he saw a shape of
white move far awai in the shadow then he grasp the black bow and
laid hand upon hi quiver so that the shaft rattl
now it would seem that the shape in the shadow heard the rattl of the
shaft or perchanc saw the moonlight gleam upon the wander golden
harnessat the least it drew near till it came to the edg of the
pool of light there it paus as a bather paus er she step into the
fountain the wander paus also wonder what the shape might be
half wa he mind to try it with an arrow from the bow but he held hi
hand and watch
and as he watch the white shape glide into the space of moonlight
and he saw that it wa the form of a woman drape in white and that
about her shone a gleam girdl and in the girdl gem which sparkl
like the ey of a snake tall wa the shape and love as a statu of
aphrodit but who or what it wa he might not tell for the head wa
bent and the face hidden
awhil the shape stood thu and as it stood the wander pass
toward it marvel much till he also stood in the pool of moonlight
that shimmer on hi golden mail then suddenli the shape lift it
face so that the light fell full on it and stretch out it arm
toward him and lo the face wa the face of the argiv helenof her
whom he went forth to seek he look upon it beauti he look upon
the ey of blue upon the golden hair upon the shine arm then
slowli veri slowli and in silencefor he could find no wordsth
wander drew near
she did not move nor speak so still she stood that scarc she seem to
breath onli the shine ey of her snakegirdl glitter like live
thing again he stop fearfulli for he held that thi wa sure a
mock ghost which stood befor him but still she neither move nor
spoke
then at length he found hi tongu and spoke
ladi he whisper is it inde thou is it argiv helen whom i look
upon or is it perchanc a ghost sent by queen persephon from the
hous of hade to make a mock of me
now the voic of helen answer him in sweet tone and low
did i not tell thee odysseu of ithaca did i not tell thee yesterdai
in the hall of hathor after thou hadst overcom the ghost that
tonight we should be wed wherefor then dost thou deem me of the
number of the bodiless
the wander hearken the voic wa the voic of helen the ey were
the ey of helen and yet hi heart fear guil
so did argiv helen tell me of a truth ladi but thi she said that i
should find her by the pylon of the templ and lead her thenc to be
my bride thither i go but now to seek her but if thou art helen how
comest thou to these palac hall and where ladi is that red star
which should gleam upon thy breast that star which weep out the blood
of men
no more doth the red dew fall from the star that wa set upon my
breast odysseu for now that thou hast won me men die no more for my
beauti sake gone is the star of war and see wisdom ring me round
the symbol of the deathless snake that signifi love etern thou dost
ask how i came hither i who am immort and a daughter of the god
seek not to know odysseu for where fate put it in my mind to be
there do the god bear me wouldst thou then that i leav thee
odysseu
last of all thing do i desir thi he answer for now hi wisdom
went awand now he forgot the word of aphrodit warn him that
the helen might be known by on thing onli the red star on her breast
whenc fall the blood of men and he no more doubt but that she wa
the golden helen
then she who wore the helen shape stretch out her arm and smile so
sweetli that the wander knew noth ani more save that she drew him
to her
slowli she glide befor him ever smile and where she went he
follow as men follow beauti in a dream she led him through hall
and corridor past the sculptur statu of the god past manhead
sphinx and pictur of longdead king
and as she goe onc more it seem to her that she hear them whisper
each to each the horror of her sin and the sorrow that shall be but
naught she heed who ever lead him on and naught he hear who ever
follow after till at length though he know it not thei stand in the
bedchamb of the queen and by pharaoh golden bed
then onc more she speak
odysseu of ithaca whom i have love from the begin and whom i
shall love till all death ar done befor thee stand that loveli
which the god predestin to thy arm now take thou thy bride but
first lai thy hand upon thi golden snake that ring me round the new
bridal gift of the god and swear thy marriag oath which mai not be
broken swear thu odysseu i love thee woman or immort and thee

great is the oath quoth the wander for though now he fear no
guil yet hi crafti heart like it ill
choos and choos swiftli she answer swear the oath or leav me
and never see me more
leav thee i will not and cannot if i would he said ladi i
swear and he laid hi hand upon the snake that ring her round and
swore the dread oath yea he forgot the word of the goddess and
the word of helen and he swore by the snake who should have sworn by
the star by the immort god he swore it by the symbol of the snake
and by the beauti of hi bride and as he swore the ey of the serpent
sparkl and the ey of her who wore the beauti of helen shone and
faintli the black bow of eurytu thrill forbod death and war
but littl the wander thought on guil or war or death for the kiss
of her whom he deem the golden helen wa on hi lip and he went up
into the golden bed of meriamun

the wake of the wander
now rei the priest as had been appoint went to the pylon gate of the
templ of hathor awhil he stood look for the wander but though
the hour had come the wander came not then the priest went to the
pylon and stood in the shadow of the gate as he stood there a wicket
in the gate open and there pass out a veil figur of a woman upon
whose breast burn a red jewel that shone in the night like a star
the woman wait awhil look down the moonlit road between the black
row of sphinx but the road lai white and empti and she turn and
hid herself in the shadow of the pylon where rei could see noth of
her except the red star that gleam upon her breast
now a great fear came upon the old man for he knew that he look upon
the strang and deadli hathor perchanc he too would perish like the
rest who had look on her to their ruin he thought of flight but he
did not dare to fly then he too stare down the road seek for the
wander but no shadow cross the moonlight thu thing went for
awhil and still the hathor stood silent in the shadow and still the
bloodr star shone upon her breast and so it came to pass that the
world desir must wait at the tryst like some forsaken villag maid
while rei the priest crouch thu against the pylon wall prai for
the come of him who came not suddenli a voic spoke to him in tone
sweeter than a lute
who art thou that hidest in the shadow said the voic
he knew that it wa the hathor who spoke and so afraid wa he that he
could not answer
then the voic spoke again
oh thou most crafti of men why doth it pleas thee to come hither to
seek me in the guis of an ag priest onc odysseu i saw thee in
beggar weed and knew thee in the midst of thy foe shall i not know
thee again in peac beneath thy fold garb and thy robe of white
rei heard and knew that he could hide himself no longer therefor he
came forward trembl and knelt befor her sai

rise thou rei and tell me why thou art come hither and where is he
whom i have name
then rei rose and look up saw the light of the helen ey shine
on him through her veil but there wa no anger in them thei shone
mildli as star in an even sky and hi heart wa comfort
i know not where the wander is o thou immort he said thi i
know onli that he bade me meet him here at on hour befor midnight
and so i came
perchanc he too will come anon said the sweet voic but why did
he whom thou namest the wander bid thee meet him here
for thi reason o hathor he told me that thi night he should be wed
to thee and wa mind thereaft to fly from khem with thee therefor
he bade me come who am a friend to him to talk with thee and him as to
how thy flight should go and yet he come not
now as rei spake he turn hi face upward and the golden helen look
upon it
hearken rei she said but yesterdai after i had stood upon the
pylon tower as the god decre and sang to those who were ripe to die
i went to my shrine and wove my web while the doom men fell beneath
the sword of them who were set to guard my beauti but who now ar
gone and as i wove on pass the ghost and rent the web and stood
befor me it wa he whom i await tonight and after awhil i knew him
for odysseu of ithaca laert son but as i look on him and spake
with him behold i saw a spirit watch us though he might not see
it a spirit whose face i knew not for no such man have i known in my

her whom i serv who is the mistress of all magic and to her it made
report but what it said i know not
and whom dost thou serv rei and why did she send thy spirit forth to
spy on me
i serv meriamun the queen and she sent my spirit forth to learn what
befel the wander when he went up against the ghost
and yet he said naught to me of thi meriamun sai rei is she fair
of all women who live upon the earth she is the veri fairest
of all sayest thou rei look now and sai if meriamun whom
thou dost serv is fairer than argiv helen whom thou dost name
the hathor and she lift her veil so that he saw the face that wa

now when he heard that name and look upon the glori of her who is
beauti self rei shrank back till he went nigh to fall on the
earth
nai he said cover hi ey with hi hand nai thou art fairer
than she
then tell me she said let fall her veil again and for thine

know the fate of him who came up against the ghost
wouldst thou know daughter of amen answer rei then i will tell
thee for through thee alon she whom i serv and love can be save from
shame meriamun doth also love the man whom thou wouldst wed
now when the golden helen heard these word she press her hand
against her bosom
so i fear she said even so she love him and he come not ah
if it be so now rei i am tempt to pai thi queen of thine in her
own craft and send thy spirit forth to spy on her nai that i will not
do for never shall helen work by shame guil or magic naybut we
will henc rei we will go to the palac where my rival dwell there
to learn the truth fear not i will bring no ill on thee nor on her
whom thou servest lead me to the palac rei lead me swiftli
now the wander slept in the arm of meriamun who wore the shape of
argiv helen hi golden har wa pile by the golden bed and by
the bed stood the black bow of eurytu the night drew on toward the
dawn when of a sudden the bow awok and sang and thu it sang
wake wake though the arm of thy love ar about thee yet
dearer by far
than her kiss is the sound of the fight
and more sweet than her voic is the cry of the trumpet and
goodlier far
than her arm is the battl delight
and what ey ar so bright as the sheen of the bronz when the
sword is aloft
what breast is so fair as the shield
or what garland of rose is dear as the helm and what sleep is
so soft
as the sleep of slain men on the field
lo the snake that wa twine about the form of her who wore the shape
of helen heard the magic song it awok it aros it twist itself
about the bodi of the wander and the bodi of her who wore the shape of
helen knit them togeth in the bond of sin it grew and lift
it woman head on high it sang in answer and thu it sang of doom
sleep be at rest for an hour as in death men believ thei shall
rest
but thei wake and thou too shalt awak
in the dark of the grave do thei stir but about them on arm and
on breast
ar the toil and the coil of the snake
by the tree where the first lover lai did i watch as i watch
where he li
love laid on the bosom of lust
then the great bow answer the snake and it sang
of the tree where the first lover sin wa i shapen i bid
thee aris
thou slayer that soon shall be dust
and the snake sang repli
be thou silent my daughter of death be thou silent nor wake
him from sleep
with the song and the sound of thy breath
the bow heard the song of the snake the death heard the song
of the
sin and again it thin music thrill upon the air for thu
it sang
be thou silent my mother of sin for thi watch it is given me
to keep
oer the sleep of the dealer of death
then the snake sang
hush hush thou art young and thou camest to birth when the
make wa done
of the world i am older therein
and the bow answer
but without me thy strength were as weak the prize of thy
strength were unwon
i am death and thy daughter o sin
now the song of the snake and the song of the bow sunk through the
depth of sleep till thei reach the wander ear he sigh he
stretch out hi mighti arm he open hi ey and lo thei look
upon the ey that bent abov him ey of flame that lit the face of
a womanth face of meriamun that waver on a serpent neck and
suddenli wa gone he cri aloud with fear and sprang from the couch
the faint light of the dawn crept through the casement and fell
upon the bed the faint light of the dawn fell upon the golden bed of
pharaoh queen it gleam upon the golden armour that wa pile by the
bed and on the polish surfac of the great black bow it shone upon
the face of her who lai in the bed
then he rememb sure he had slept with the golden helen who wa
hi bride and sure he had dream an evil dream a dream of a snake
that wore the face of pharaoh queen yea there lai the golden helen
won at lastth golden helen now made a wife to him now he mock hi
own fear and now he bent to wake her with a kiss faintli the newborn
light crept and gather on her face ah how beauti she wa in
sleep nai what wa thi whose face wa thi beneath hi own not so
had helen look in the shrine of her templ when he tore the web not
so had helen seem yonder in the pillar hall when she stood in the
moonlit spacenot so had she seem when he sware the great oath to
love her and her alon whose beauti wa it then that now he saw by
the immort god it wa the beauti of meriamun it wa the glori of
the pharaoh queen
he stare upon her love sleep face while terror shook hi soul
how could thi be what then had he done
then light broke upon him he look around the chamberther on the
wall were the graven imag of the god of khem there abov the bed
the name of meneptah and meriamun were written side by side in the
sacr sign of khem not with the golden helen had he slept but with
the wife of pharaoh to her he had sworn the oath and she had worn the
helen shapeand now the spell wa broken
he stood amaz and as he stood again the great bow thrill warn
him of death to come then hi strength came back to him and he seiz
hi armour and girt it about him piec by piec till he lift the

marbl floor with a crash it fell and she who slept in the bed awok
with a cry and sprang from the bed her dark hair stream down her
nightgear held to her by the golden snake with gemmi ey that she must

the vengeanc of kurri
the wander and pharaoh queen stood face to face in the twilight of
the chamber thei stood in silenc while bitter anger and burn shame
pour into hi heart and shone from hi ey but the face of meriamun
wa cold as the dead and on it wa a smile such as the carven sphinx

limb quiver like a shaken reed at length she spoke

which the spirit know therefor put me not from thee and rais not my
wrath against thee for if i us my magic to bring thee to my arm yet
thei ar thy home and onc more she came toward him
now the wander drew an arrow from hi quiver and set the notch
against hi breast and the keen barb toward the breast of meriamun
draw on he said thu will i take thee to my arm again hearken
meriamun the witchmeriamun the harlot pharaoh wife and queen of

tell them all thy shame ay and all my sorrow i will shout it in the
street i will publish it from the templ top and when pharaoh come
again i will call it into hi ear till he and all who live in khem know
thee for what thou art and see thee in thy nake shame
she hearken and her face grew terribl to see a moment she stood as
though in thought on hand press to her brow and on upon her breast
then she spoke
is that thy last word wander
it is my last word queen he answer and turn to go
then with the hand that rest on her breast she rent her night robe
and tore her perfum hair past him she rush toward the door and as
she ran sent scream on scream echo up the paint wall
the curtain shook the door were burst asund and through them
pour guard eunuch and waitingwomen
help she cri point to the wander help help oh save mine
honour from thi evil man thi foreign thief whom pharaoh set to guard
me and who guard me thu thi coward who dare to creep upon meth
queen of khemeven as i slept in pharaoh bed and she cast herself
upon the floor and threw her hair about her and lai there groan and
weep as though in the last agoni of shame
now when the guard saw how the thing wa a great cry of rage and shame
went up from them and thei rush upon the wander like wolv upon a
stag at bai but he leapt backward to the side of the bed and even as
he leapt he set the arrow in hi hand upon the string of the great black
bow then he drew it to hi ear the bowstr sang the arrow rush
forth and he who stood befor it got hi death again the bowstr
sang again the arrow rush and lo anoth man wa sped a third time
he drew the bow and the soul of a third went down the wai of hell now
thei roll back from him as the water roll from a rock for none dare
face the shaft of death thei shot at him with spear and arrow from
behind the shelter of the pillar but none of these might harm him for
some fell from hi mail and some he caught upon hi buckler
now among those who had run thither at the sound of the cri of
meriamun wa that same kurri the miser captain of the sidonian
whose life the wander had spare and whom he had given to the queen
to be her jewel and when kurri saw the wander plight he thought
in hi greedi heart of those treasur that he had lost and of how he
who had been a captain and a rich merchant of sidon wa now noth but
a slave
then a great desir came upon him to work the wander ill if so he
might now all round the edg of the chamber were shadow for the light
wa yet faint and kurri crept into the shadow carri a long spear
in hi hand and that spear wa haft into the bronz point which had
stood in the wander helm littl did the wander glanc hi wai
for he watch the lanc and arrow that flew toward him from the
portal so the end of it wa that the sidonian pass round the chamber
unseen and climb into the golden bed of pharaoh on the further side of
the bed now the wander stood with hi back to the bed and a spear
length from it and in the silken hang were fix spear and arrow
kurri first thought wa to stab him in the back but thi he did
not first becaus he fear lest he should fail to pierc the golden
har and the wander should turn and slai him and again becaus
he hope that the wander would be put to death by torment and he wa
fain to have a hand in it for after the fashion of the sidonian he wa
skill in the torment of men therefor he wait till present
the wander let fall hi buckler and drew the bow but er the arrow
reach hi ear kurri had stretch out hi spear from between the
hang and touch the string with the keen bronz so that it burst
asund and the grei shaft fell upon the marbl floor then as the
wander cast down the bow and turn with a cry to spring on him who
had cut the cord for hi ey had caught the sheen of the outstretch
spear kurri lift the cover of the purpl web which lai upon the
bed and deftli cast it over the hero head so that he wa inmesh
thereon the soldier and the eunuch took heart see what had been
done and er ever the wander could clear himself from the cover
and draw hi sword thei rush upon him cumber as he wa thei might
not easili overcom him but in the end thei bore him down and held
him fast so that he could not stir so much as a finger then on cri
aloud to meriamun
the lion is trap o queen sai shall we slai him
but meriamun who had watch the frai through cover of her hand
shudder and made answer
nai but lock hi tongu with a gag strip hi armour from him and
bind him with fetter of bronz and make him fast to the dungeon wall
with great chain of bronz there shall he bide till pharaoh come
again for against pharaoh honour he hath sin and shamefulli broken
that oath he swore to him and therefor shall pharaoh make him die in
such fashion as seem good to him
now when kurri heard these word and saw the wander sorri plight
he bent over him and said
it wa i kurri the sidonian who cut the cord of thy great bow
eperitu with the spearpoint that thou gavest back to me i cut it i
whose folk thou didst slai and madest me a slave and i will crave thi
boon of pharaoh that mine shall be the hand to torment thee night and
dai till at last thou diest curs the dai that thou wast born
the wander look upon him and answer there thou liest thou
sidonian dog for thi is written in thy face that thou thyself shalt
die within an hour and that strang
then kurri shrank back scowl but no more word might odysseu speak
for at onc thei forc hi jaw apart and gag him with a gag of
iron and thereaft strip hi har from him thei bound him
with fetter as the queen had command
now while thei dealt thu with the wander meriamun pass into
anoth chamber and swiftli threw robe upon her to hide her disarrai
clasp them round her with the golden girdl which now she must alwai
wear but her long hair she left unbound nor did she wash the stain of
tear from her face for she wa mind to seem shame and woebegon in
the ey of all men till pharaoh came again
rei and the golden helen pass through the street of the citi till
thei came to the palac gate and here thei must wait till the dawn
for rei think to come thither with the wander who wa captain of
the guard had not learn the word of entri
easi would it be for me to win my wai through those great gate said
the helen to rei at her side but it is my counsel that we wait awhil
perchanc he whom we seek will come forth
so thei enter the porch of the templ of osiri that look toward
the gate and there thei wait till the dawn gather in the eastern
sky the helen spoke no word but rei watch her knew that she wa
troubl at heart though he might not see her face becaus of the veil
she wore for from time to time she sigh and the red star rose and
fell upon her breast
at length the first arrow of the dawn fell upon the templ porch and she
spoke
now let us enter she said my heart forebod evil inde but much
of evil i have known and where the god drive me there i must go
thei came to the gate and the man who watch them open to the
priest rei and the veil woman who went with him though he marvel
at the beauti of the woman shape
where ar thy fellowguard rei ask of the soldier
i know not he answer but anon a great tumult rose in the palac
and the captain of the gate went thither leav me onli to guard the
gate
hast thou seen the lord eperitu rei ask again
nai i have not seen him sinc suppertim last night nor ha he
visit the guard as is hi wont
rei pass on wonder and with him went helen as thei trod the
palac thei saw folk fly toward the hall of banquet that is near
the queen chamber some bore arm in their hand and some bore none
but all fled east toward the hall of banquet whenc came a sound of
shout now thei drew near the hall and there at the further end
where the door ar that lead to the queen chamber a great crowd wa
gather
hide thee ladyhid thee said rei to her who went with him for
methink that death is afoot here see here hang a curtain stand thou
behind it while i learn what thi tumult mean
she step behind the curtain that hung between the pillar as rei bade
her for now helen gentl breast wa full of fear and she wa as on
daze even as she step on came fly down the hall who wa of the
servant of rei the priest
stai thou rei cri to him and tell me what happen yonder
ill deed lord said the servant eperitu the wander whom
pharaoh made captain of hi guard when he went forth to slai the rebel
apuraeperitu hath laid hand on the queen whom he wa set to guard
but she fled from him and her cri awok the guard and thei fell upon
him in pharaoh veri chamber some he slew with shaft from the great
black bow but kurri the sidonian cut the string of the bow and the
wander wa born down by mani men now thei have bound him and drag
him to the dungeon there to await judgment from the lip of pharaoh
see thei bring him i must begon on my errand to the keeper of the
dungeon
the golden helen heard the shame tale and such sorrow took her that
had she been mortal she had sure di thi then wa the man whom she
had chosen to love thi wa he whom last night she should have wed
onc more the god had made a mock of her so had it ever been so
should it ever be loveless she had live all her life dai now she
had learn to love onc and for everand thi wa the fruit of it
she clasp the curtain lest she should sink to the earth and hear
a sound look forth a multitud of men came down the hall befor them
walk ten soldier bear a litter on their shoulder in the litter
lai a man gag and fetter with fetter of bronz so that he might
not stir and thei bore him as men bear a stag from the chase or a wild
bull to the sacrific it wa the wander self the wander overcom
at last and he seem so mighti even in hi bond and hi ey shone
with so fierc a light that the crowd shrank from him as though in
fear thu did helen see her love and lord again as thei bore him
dishonour to hi dungeon cell she saw and a moan and a cry burst
from her heart a moan for her own woe and a cry for the shame and
faithless of him whom she must love
oh how fallen art thou odysseu who wast of men the veri first she
cri
he heard it and knew the voic of her who cri and he gaze around
the great vein swell upon hi neck and forehead and he struggl so
fierc that he fell from the litter to the ground but he might not
rise becaus of the fetter nor speak becaus of the gag so thei
lift him again and bore him thenc
and after him went all the multitud save rei alon for rei wa fallen
in shame and grief becaus of the tale that he had heard and of the deed
of dark that the man he love had done for not yet did he rememb
and learn to doubt so he stood hide hi ey in hi hand and as he
stood helen came forth and touch him on the shoulder sai
lead me henc old man lead me back to my templ my love is lost
inde but there where i found it i will abid till the god make their
will clear to me
he bow sai no word and follow helen step into the centr of
the hall there he stop inde for down it came the queen her hair
stream all her robe disord and her face stain with tear
she wa alon save for kurri the sidonian who follow her and she
walk wildli as on distraught who know not where she goe nor why
helen saw her also
who is thi royal ladi that draw near she ask of rei
it is meriamun the queen she whom the wander hath brought to shame
stai then i would speak with her
nai nai cri rei she love thee not ladi and will slai thee
that cannot be helen answer
ii
the come of pharaoh
present as she walk meriamun saw rei the priest and the veil
woman at hi side and she saw on the woman breast a red jewel that
burnt and glow like a heart of fire then like fire burn the heart
of meriamun for she knew that thi wa argiv helen who stood befor
her helen whose shape she had stolen like a thief and with the mind of
a thief
sai she cri to rei who bow befor her sai who is thi woman
rei look at the queen with terrifi ey and spake in a voic of
warn
thi is that goddess who dwell in the templ of hathor he said let
her pass in peac o queen
in peac she shall pass inde answer meriamun what saidest
thou old dotard that goddess nai no goddess have we here but an
evilwork witch who hath brought woe unnumb upon khem becaus
of her men die month by month till the vault of the templ of hathor
ar full of her slain becaus of her it wa that curs upon curs fell
on the landth curs of water turn to blood of hail and of terribl
dark ay and the curs of the death of the firstborn among whom my
own son di and thou hast dare rei to bring thi witch here to my
palac hall by amen if i had not love thee alwai thy life should
pai the price and thou and she stretch her hand toward the helen
thou hast dare to come it is well no more shalt thou bring evil upon
khem hearken slave and she turn to kurri the sidonian draw that
knife of thine and plung it to the hilt in the breast of yonder woman
so shalt thou win freedom and all thy good shall be given thee again
then for the first time helen spake
i charg thee ladi she said in slow soft tone bid not thy servant
do thi deed for though i have littl will to bring evil upon men yet
i mai not lightli be affront
now kurri hung back doubtfulli finger hi dagger
draw knave draw cri meriamun and do my bid or present
thou shalt be slain with thi same knife
when the sidonian heard these word he cri aloud with fear for he
well knew that as the queen said so it would be done to him instantli
he drew the great knife and rush upon the veil woman but as he
came helen lift her veil so that her ey fell upon hi ey and
the bright of their beauti wa reveal to him and when he saw her
loveli he stop suddenli as on who is transfix of a spear then
mad came upon him and with a cry he lift the knife and plung
it not into her heart but into hi own fell down dead
thi then wa the miser end of kurri the sidonian slain by the
sight of the beauti
thou seest ladi said helen turn from the dead sidonian no man
mai harm me
for a moment the queen stood astonish while rei the priest mutter
prayer to the protect god then she cri
begon thou live curs begon wherefor art thou come here to work
more woe in thi hous of woe and death
fear not answer the helen present i will begon and troubl
thee no more thou askest why i am come hither i came to see him who
wa my love and whom but last night i should have wed but whom the
god have brought to shame unspeak odysseu of ithaca odysseu
laert son for thi caus i came and i have stai to look upon the
face of her whose beauti had power to drive the thought of me from the
heart of odysseu and bring him who of all men wa the greatest hero
and the foremost left aliv to do a dastard deed and make hi mighti
name a byword and a scorn knowest thou meriamun that i find the
matter strang sinc if all els be fals yet is thi true that among
women the fairest ar the most strong thou art fair inde meriamun
but judg if thou art more fair than argiv helen and she drew the
veil from her face so that the splendour of her beauti shone out upon
the queen dark loveli thu for awhil thei stood each face
each and to rei it seem as though the spirit of death and life
look on on anoth as though the dark and the daylight stood in
woman shape befor him
thou art fair inde said the queen but in thi witch ha thy
beauti fail to hold him whom thou wouldst wed from the most shameless
sin littl methink can that man have love thee who crept upon me like
a thief to snatch my honour from me
then helen bethought her of what rei had said that meriamun love the
wander and she spoke again
now it come into my heart egyptian that true and fals ar mix in
thi tale of thine hard it is to believ that odysseu of ithaca could
work such a coward deed as thi or unbidden seek to clasp thee to hi
heart moreov i read in thine ey that thou thyself dost love the
man whom thou namest dastard nai hold thy peac look not so wildli
on me whom thou canst not harm but hearken whether thy tale be true or
fals i know not who us no magic and learn those thing onli that the
god reveal to me but thi at the least is true that odysseu whom i
should have wed ha look on thee with ey of love even in that hour
when i wait to be made hi wife therefor the love that but two dai
agon bloom in my heart di and wither or if it doe not at least
i cast it from me and tread it flower beneath my feet for thi doom
the god have laid upon me who am of all women the most hapless to
live belov but loveless through mani year and at the last to love
and be betrai and now i go henc back to my templ shrine but fear
not meriamun not for long shall i troubl thee or khem and men shall
die no more becaus of my beauti for i shall present pass henc
whither the god appoint and thi i sai to theedeal gentli with that
man who ha betrai my faith for whatev he did wa done for the love
of thee it is no mean thing to have won the heart of odysseu of ithaca
out of the hand of argiv helen fare thee well meriamun who wouldst
have slain me mai the god grant thee better dai and more of joi than
is given to helen who would look upon thy face no more
thu she spake and let her veil fall turn to go for awhil the
queen stood shame to silenc by these gentl word that fell like dew
upon the fire of her hate but er helen had pass the length of a
spear her furi burn up again what should she let thi strang woman
gothi woman who alon of all that breath wa more beauti than
she by the aid of whose stolen beauti she alon had won her love and
for whose sake she had endur such bitter word of scorn nai while
helen yet live she could find not joi nor sleep but were helen dead
then perchanc all might yet be well and the wander yet be her for
when the best is gone men turn them to the better
close the gate and bar them she cri to the men who now stream
back into the hall and thei ran to do her bid so that befor helen
reach the palac door thei had been shut and the gate of bronz
beyond had clash like the shield of men
now helen drew near the door
stai yon witch cri the queen to those who guard them and in

of that soldier who wa next to the queen so that he fell down dead

then helen turn and spoke

iii
the bed of torment
it wa nightfal and pharaoh sat at meat and meriamun sat by him the
heart of pharaoh wa veri heavi he thought of that great armi which now
wash to and fro on the water of the sea of weed of whose number
he alon had live to tell the tale he thought also of the host of the
apura who made a mock of him in the desert but most of all he brood
on the tide that the messeng had brought tide of the march
of the barbarian and of the fleet of the aquaiusha that sail on the
eastern stream of sihor all that dai he had sat in hi council chamber
and sent forth messeng east and north and south bid them gather
the mercenari from everi town and in everi citi men to make war
against the foe for here in hi whitewal citi of tani there were
left but five thousand soldier and now weari with toil and war he
sat at meat and as he sat bethought him of the man whom he had left to
guard the queen
where then is that great wander he who wore the golden har
he ask present
i have a tale to tell thee of the man meriamun answer slowli a
tale which i have not told becaus of all the evil tide that beat
about our ear like sand in a desert wind
tell on said pharaoh
then she bent toward him whisper in hi ear
as she whisper the face of pharaoh grew black as the night and er
all the tale wa done he sprang to hi feet
by amen and by ptah he cri here at least we have a foe whom we
mai conquer thou and i meriamun my sister and my queen ar set as
far each from each as the sky is set from the templ top and littl
of love is there between us yet i will wipe awai thi blot upon thy
honour which also is a blot upon my own sleepless shall thi wander
lie tonight and sorri shall he go tomorrow but tomorrow night he
shall sleep inde
thereupon he clap hi hand summon the guard and bade them pass
to the dungeon where the wander lai and lead him thenc to the place
of punish he bade them also call the tormentor to make readi the
instrument of their craft and await him in the place of punish
then he sat for awhil drink sullenli till on came to tell him
that all wa prepar then pharaoh rose
comest thou with me he ask
nai said meriamun i would not look upon the man again and thi i
charg thee go not down to him thi night let him be found upon the
bed of torment and let the tormentor give him food and wine for so he
shall die more hardli then let them light the fire at hi head and at
hi feet and leav him till the dawn alon in the place of torment so
he shall die a hundr death er ever hi death begin
as thou wilt answer pharaoh mete out thine own punish
tomorrow when i have slept i will look upon hi torment and he spoke
to hi servant as she desir
the wander lai on the bed of torment in the place of torment thei
had taken the gag from hi mouth and given him food and wine as pharaoh
command he at and drank and hi strength came back to him then thei
made fast hi fetter lit the brazier at hi head and foot and left
him with mock word
he lai upon the bed of stone and groan in the bitter of hi heart
here then wa the end of hi wander and thi wa the breast of the
golden helen in whose arm aphrodit had sworn that he should lie
oh that he were free again and stood face to face with hi foe hi
har on hi back nai it might not be no mortal strength could
burst these fetter not even the strength of odysseu laert son
where now were those god whom he had serv should he never again hear
the clarion cry of palla why then had he turn him from palla and
worship at the shrine of the fals idalian queen thu it wa that
she kept her oath thu she repaid her votari
so he thought in the bitter of hi heart as he lai with close ey
upon the bed of torment whenc there wa no escap and groan would
aphrodit that i had never serv thee even for on littl hour then
had my lot gone otherwis
now he open hi ey and lo a great glori roll about the place
of torment and as he wonder at the glori a voic spoke from it
midstth voic of the idalian aphrodit
blame me not odysseu said the heavenli voic blame me not becaus
thou art come to thi pass thyself son of laert art to blame what
did i tell thee wa it not that thou shouldst know the golden helen by
the red star on her breast the jewel whenc fall the red drop fast
and by the star alon and did she not tell thee also that thou
shouldst know her by the star yet when on came to thee wear no star
but girdl with a snake my word were all forgotten thy desir
led thee whither thou wouldst not go thou wast blind by desir and
couldst not discern the fals from the true beauti ha mani shape now
it is that of helen now that of meriamun each see it as he desir
it but the star is yet the star and the snake is yet the snake and
he who bewild of hi lust swear by the snake when he should have
sworn by the star shall have the snake for guerdon
she ceas and the wander spoke groan bitterli
i have sin o queen he said is there then no forgiv for my
sin
yea there is forgiv odysseu but first there is punish
thi is thy fate never now in thi space of life shalt thou be the
lord of the golden helen for thou hast sworn by the snake and hi thou
art nor mayest thou reach the star yet it still shine on through
the mist of death it shall shine for thee and when thou wakest again
behold thine ey shall see it fitfulli
and now thi for thy comfort here thou shalt not die nor by torment
for thy death shall come to thee from the water as the dead seer
foretold but er thou diest onc more thou shalt look upon the golden
helen and hear her word of love and know her kiss though thine she
shall not be and learn that a great host march upon the land of khem
and with it sail a fleet of thine own peopl the achan go down and
meet them and take what come where the sword shine that smote troi
and thi fate is laid upon thee that thou shalt do battl against thy
own peopl even against the son of them by whose side thou didst
fight beneath the wall of ilio and in that battl thou shalt find thy
death and in thy death thou wander thou shalt find that which all
men seek the breast of the immort helen for though here on earth
she seem to live etern it is but the shadow of her beauti that men
seeeach as he desir it in the hall of death she dwell and in
the garden of queen persephon and there she shall be won for there
no more is beauti guard of those that stand between men and joi and
there no more shall the snake seem as the star and sin have power to
sever those that ar on now make thy heart strong odysseu and so do
as thy wisdom tell thee farewel
thu the goddess spoke from the cloud of glori and lo she wa gone
but the heart of the wander wa fill with joi becaus he knew that
the helen wa not lost to him for ever and he no more fear the death
of shame
now it wa midnight and pharaoh slept but meriamun the queen slept
not she rose from her bed she wrap herself in a dark cloak that hid
her face and take a lamp in her hand glide through the empti hall
till she came to a secret stair down which she pass there wa a gate
at the foot of the stair and a guard slept by it she push him with
her foot
he awok and sprang toward her but she held a signet befor hi ey
an old ring of great queen taia whereon a hathor worship the sun
then he bow and open the gate she swept on through mani passag
deep into the bowel of the earth till she came to the door of a littl
chamber where a light shone men talk in the chamber and she listen
to their talk thei spoke much and laugh gleefulli then she enter
the doorwai and look upon them thei were six in number evilei men
of ethiopia and seat in a circl in the centr of the circl lai the
waxen imag of a man and thei were cut it with knive and sear
it with needl of iron and pincer made redhot and mani instrument
strang and dread to look upon for these were the tormentor and
thei spoke of those pain that tomorrow thei should wreak upon the
wander and practis them
but meriamun who love him shiver as she look and mutter thu
beneath her breath
thi i promis you black minist of death that in the same fashion
ye shall die er anoth night be sped
then she pass into the chamber hold the signet on high and the
tormentor fell upon their face befor her majesti she pass between
them and as she went she stamp with her sandal foot upon the
waxen imag and brake it on the further side of the chamber wa anoth
passag and thi she follow till she reach a door of stone that
stood ajar here she paus awhil for from within the chamber there
came a sound of sing and the voic wa the wander voic and
thu he sang
endur my heart not long shalt thou endur
the shame the smart
the good and ill ar done the end is sure
endur my heart
there stand two vessel by the golden throne
of zeu on high
from these he scatter mirth and scatter moan
to men that die
and thou of mani joi hast had thy share
thy perfect part
battl and love and evil thing and fair

wage that war well
then seek thy fellow in the shadowi field
of asphodel
there is the knightli hector there the men
who fought for troi

were that not joi
though no sun shine beyond the duski west
thy perfect part
there shalt thou have of the unbroken rest
endur my heart
meriamun heard and wonder at thi man hardihood and the great
of hi heart who could sing thu as he lai upon the bed of torment now
she push the door open silent and pass in the place where she
stood wa dread it wa shape as a lofti vault and all the wall
were paint with the torment of those who pass down to set after
live wickedli on earth in the wall were great ring of bronz and
chain and fetter of bronz wherein the bone of men yet hung in the
centr of the vault there wa a bed of stone on which the wander wa
fasten with fetter he wa nake save onli for a waistcloth and at
hi head and feet burn polish brazier that gave light to the vault
and shone upon the instrument of torment beyond the further brazier
grin the gate of sekhet that is shape like a woman and the chain
wherein the victim is set for the last torment by fire were hang
from the roof
meriamun pass stealthili behind the head of the wander who might
not see her becaus of the strait of hi bond yet it seem to her
that he heard somewhat for he ceas from sing and turn hi ear
to hearken she stood awhil in silenc look on him she love who
of all live men wa the goodliest by far then at length he spoke
craftili
who art thou he said if thou art of the number of the tormentor
begin thy work i fear thee not and no groan shall thy worst tortur
wring from these lip of mine but i tell thee thi that er i be three
dai dead the god shall aveng me terribl both on thee and those who
sent thee with fire and with sword thei shall aveng me for a great
host gather and draw nigh a host of mani nation gather out of all
land ay and a fleet man with the son of my own peopl of the
achan terribl in war thei rush on like raven wolv and the land
is black befor them but the land shall be stamp red behind their
feet soon thei shall give thi citi to the flame the smoke of it
shall go up to heaven and the fire shall be quench at last in the
blood of it childrenai in thy blood thou who dost look on me
hear these word meriamun bent forward to look on the face of the
speaker and to see what wa written there and as she move her cloak
slip apart show the snake head with the ey of flame that wa
set about her as a girdl fierc thei gleam and the semblanc of
them wa shown faintli on the polish surfac of the brazier wherein
the fire burn at the wander feet he saw it and now he knew who
stood behind him
sai meriamun the queenpharaoh dishonour wife he said sai
wherefor art thou come to look upon thy work nai stand not behind
me stand where i mai see thee fear not i am strongli bound nor mai i
lift a hand against thee
then meriamun still speak no word but wonder much becaus he
knew her er hi ey fell upon her pass round the bed of torment
and throw down her cloak stood befor him in her dark and royal
loveli
he look upon her beauti then spoke again
sai wherefor art thou come hither meriamun sure with my ear i
heard thee swear that i had wrong thee wouldst thou then look on him
who wrong thee or art thou come perchanc to watch my torment
while thy slave tear limb from limb and quench yon fire with my
blood oh thou evil woman thou hast work woe on me inde and
perchanc canst work more woe now that i lie helpless here but thi i
tell thee that thy torment shall outnumb mine as the star outnumb
the earth for here and hereaft thou shalt be parch with such a
thirst of love as never mai be quench and in mani anoth land and
in mani anoth time thou shalt endur thine agoni afresh again and
yet again thou shalt clasp and conquer again and yet again thou
shalt let slip and in the moment of triumph lose by the snake head i
swore my troth to thee i who should have sworn by the star and thi
i tell thee meriamun that as the star shall shine and be my beacon
through the ag so through the ag shall the snake encircl thee and
be thy doom
hold said meriamun pour no more bitter word upon me who am
distraught of love and wa madden by thy scorn wouldst thou know
then why i am come hither for thi caus i am come to save thee
from thy doom hearken the time is short it is truethough how thou
knowest it i mai not guessit is true that the barbarian march on
khem and with them sail a fleet laden with the warrior of thine own
peopl thi also is true pharaoh ha return alon and all hi host
is swallow in the sea of weed and i foolish that i am i would save
thee odysseu thu i will put it in the heart of pharaoh to pardon
thy great offenc and send thee forward against the foe ye i can do
it but thi thou shalt swear to me to be true to pharaoh and smite
the barbarian host
that i will swear said the wander ay and keep the oath though
it is hard to do battl on my kin is that all thy messag meriamun
not all odysseu on more thing must thou swear or if thou swearest
it not here thou shalt sure die know thi she who in khem is name
the hathor but who perchanc ha other name hath put thee from her
becaus last night thou wast wed to me

also that if pharaoh be gather to osiri and it should chanc that
she who is name the hathor pass with him to the underworld then that
thou odysseu wilt wed me meriamun and be faith to me for thy
life dai
now the crafti odysseu took counsel with hi heart and bethought him
of the word of the goddess he saw that it wa in the mind of meriamun
to slai pharaoh and the helen but he care noth for the fate of
pharaoh and knew well that helen might not be harm and that though
she chang etern wear now thi shape and now that yet she di

shame and for ever
now meriamun heard and knelt besid him look upon him with ey of

iv
pharaoh dream
pharaoh slept heavili in hi place for he wa weari with grief and
toil but meriamun pass into the chamber and stand at the foot of
the golden bed lift up her hand and by her art call vision down
on pharaoh fals dream through the ivori gate so pharaoh dream and
thu hi vision went
he dream that he slept in hi bed and that the statu of ptah the
creator descend from the pedest by the templ gate and came to
him tower over him like a giant then he dream that he awok and
prostrat himself befor the god ask the mean of hi come
thereon the god spoke to him
meneptah my son whom i love hearken unto me the ninebow barbarian
overrun the ancient land of khem nine nation march up against khem
and lai it wast hearken unto me my son and i will give thee victori
awak awak from sloth and i will give thee victori thou shalt hew
down the ninebow barbarian as a countryman hew a rot palm thei
shall fall and thou shalt spoil them but hearken unto me my son thou
shalt not thyself go up against them low in thy dungeon there li a
mighti chief skill in the warfar of the barbarian a wander who
hath wander far thou shalt releas him from hi bond and set him
over thy armi and of the sin that he ha sin thou shalt take no
heed awak awak meneptah with thi bow which i give thee shalt thou
smite the ninebow barbarian
then meriamun laid the bow of the wander even the black bow of
eurytu on the bed besid pharaoh and pass thenc to her own
chamber and the deceit dream too pass awai
earli in the morn a waitingwoman came to the queen sai that
pharaoh would speak with her she went into the antechamb and found
him there and in hi hand wa the black bow of eurytu
dost thou know thi weapon he ask
yea i know it she answer and thou shouldst know it also for
sure it save us from the furi of the peopl on the night of the death
of the firstborn it is the bow of the wander who li in the
place of torment and wait hi doom becaus of the wrong he would have
wrought upon me
if he hath wrong thee yet it is he who shall save khem from
the barbarian said pharaoh listen now to the dream that i have
dream and he told her all the vision
it is inde evil that he who would have wrought such wicked upon
me should go forth honour the first of the host of pharaoh quoth
meriamun yet as the god hath spoken so let it be send now and bid
them loos the man from the place of torment and put hi armour on him
and bring him befor thee
so pharaoh went out and the wander wa loos from hi bed of stone
and cloth again in hi golden har and came forth gloriou to see
and stood befor pharaoh but no arm were given him then pharaoh told
him all hi dream and why he caus him to be releas from the grip of
the tormentor the wander hearken in silenc sai no word
now choos thou wander said pharaoh choos if thou wilt be
born back to the bed of torment there to die beneath the hand of the
tormentor or if thou wilt go forth as the captain of my host to do
battl with the ninebow barbarian who wast the land of khem it seem
there is littl faith in thine oath therefor i ask no more oath from
thee but thi i swear that if thou art fals to my trust i will yet
find mean to bring thee back to that chamber whenc thou wast led but
now
then the wander spoke
of that charg pharaoh which is laid against me i will sai noth
though perchanc if i stood upon my trial for the sin that is laid
against me i might find word to sai thou askest no oath from me and
no oath i swear yet i tell thee that if thou givest me ten thousand
soldier and a hundr chariot i will smite these foe of thine so
that thei shall come no more to khem ay though thei be of my own
peopl yet will i smite them and if i fail then mai those who go with
me slai me and send me down to hade
thu he spoke and as he spoke he search the hall with hi ey
for he desir to see rei the priest and charg him with a messag to
helen but he sought him in vain for rei had fled and wa in hide
from the anger of meriamun
then pharaoh bade hi offic take the wander and set him in
a chariot and bear him to the citi of on where pharaoh host wa
gather their charg wa to watch him night and dai with uplift
sword and if he so much as turn hi face from the foe toward tani
then thei should slai him but when the host of pharaoh march from
on to do battl on the foe then thei should give the wander hi own
sword and the great black bow and obei him in everyth but if he
turn hi back upon the foe then thei should slai him or if the host
of pharaoh were driven back by the foe then thei should slai him
the wander heard and smile as a wolf smile but spoke no word
thereon the great offic of pharaoh took him and led him forth thei
set him in a chariot and with the chariot went a thousand horsemen and
soon meriamun watch from the wall of tani saw the long line of
desert dust that mark the pass of the wander from the citi which
he should see no more
the wander also look back on tani with a heavi heart there far
awai he could see the shrine of hathor gleam like crystal abov the
tawni flood of water and he must go down to death leav no word for
her who sat in the shrine and deem him faithless and forsworn evil
wa the lot that the god had laid upon him and bitter wa hi guerdon
hi thought were sad enough while the chariot roll toward the citi
of on where the host of pharaoh wa gather and the thunder of the
feet of hors echo in hi ear when as he ponder it chanc that
he look up there on a knoll of sand befor him a bowshot from the
chariot stood a camel and on the camel a man sat as though he wait
the come of the host idli the wander wonder who thi might be
and as he wonder the man urg the camel toward the chariot and
halt befor it cri hold in a loud voic
who art thou cri the captain of the chariot who darest cry hold
to the host of pharaoh
i am on who have tide of the barbarian the man made answer from
the camel

cloth wa as a beggar rag though the trap of the camel were
of purpl leather and boss with silver again the wander look he

now the captain of the chariot bade the driver halt the hors and
cri draw near and tell thy tide
to none will i tell my tide save to him who shall lead the host of
pharaoh let him come down from the chariot and speak with me
that mai not be said the captain for he wa charg that the

the god
i am mind to bid the soldier shoot thee with arrow cri the
captain in anger
so shall my wisdom sink in the sand with my blood and be lost with my
breath shoot on thou fool
now the captain wa perplex for from the aspect of the man he deem
that he wa sent by the god he look at the wander who took but
littl heed or so it seem but in hi crafti heart he knew that thi
wa the best wai to win speech with the man upon the camel then the
captain took counsel with the captain of the horsemen and in the end
thei said to the wander

there hold speech with the man but if thou go on pace further then we
will shoot thee and the man with arrow and thi he cri out also to
him who sat upon the camel
then the man on the camel descend and walk twelv pace forward
and the wander descend also from the chariot and walk twelv pace
forward but as on who heed littl what he doe now the two stood
face to face but out of earshot of the host who watch them with
arrow set upon the string
greet odysseu of ithaca son of laert he said who wa cloth

the wander look upon him hard and knew him through hi disguis
greet rei the priest command of the legion of amen chief of the
treasuri of amen
rei the priest i am inde he answer the rest i am no more for

the shape of argiv helen
and then in as few word as might be he told rei how he had been led
awai by the magic of meriamun how he who should have sworn by the star
had sworn by the snake
when rei heard that the wander had sworn by the snake he shudder
now i know all he said fear not thou wander not on thee shall
all the evil fall nor on that immort whom thou dost love the snake
that beguil thee shall aveng thee also
rei the wander said on thing i charg thee i know that i go

then he went back to the camel and climb it and pass round the
armi vanish swiftli in a cloud of dust
the wander also went back to the host where the captain murmur
becaus of the halt and mount hi chariot but he would tell noth
of what the man had said to him save that he wa sure a messeng
from the underworld to instruct him in the wage of the war
then the chariot and the horsemen pass on again till thei came to the
citi of on and found the host of pharaoh gather in the great wall
space that is befor the templ of ra and there thei pitch their camp
hard by the great obelisk that stand at the inner gate which rei the
architect fashion by thebe and the divin rames miamun set up to
the glori of ra for ever
v
the voic of the dead
when meriamun the queen had watch the chariot of the wander till it
wa lost in the dust of the desert she pass down from the palac roof
to the solitud of her chamber
here she sat in her chamber till the dark gather as the evil
thought gather in her heart that wa rent with love of him whom she
had won but to lose thing had gone ill with her to littl purpos she
had sin after such a fashion as mai not be forgiven yet there wa
hope he had sworn that he would wed her when pharaoh wa dead and when
argiv helen had follow pharaoh to the shade should she shrink then
from the deed of blood nai from evil to evil she would go she laid
her hand upon the doublehead snake that wound her about and spake
into the gloom
osiri wait thee meneptahosiri wait thee the shade of those who

done pharaoh thou diest tonight tomorrow night thou goddess helen
shall all thy tale be told man mai not harm thee inde but shall

then she rose and call her ladi wa attir in her most splendid
robe and caus the uraeu crown to be set upon her head the snake
circlet of power on her brow the snake girdl of wisdom at her heart
and now she hid somewhat in her breast and pass to the antechamb
where the princ gather for the feast
pharaoh look up and saw her loveli so gloriou she seem in her
royal beauti that hi heart forgot it woe and onc again he love her
as he had done in year gone by when she conquer him at the game of
piec and he had cast hi arm about her and she stab him
she saw the look of love grow on hi heavi face and all her gather
hate rose in her breast though she smile gentli with her lip and
spake him fair
thei sat at the feast and pharaoh drank and ever as he drank she smile
upon him with her dark ey and spake him word of gentlest mean
till at length there wa noth he desir more than that thei should

look into her ey nor did she sai him nai
there wa a lute ly on a golden tabl and there too as it chanc

pharaoh took up the gold king from the board and toi with it in hi

she had lift the lute and her finger touch listlessli on the cord
nai i know not she said who know how did pentaur sing of love
renew pentaur the gloriou minstrel of our father rames miamun
he laid the gold king on the board and began listlessli to cast the

love will not wake again

love refus their prayer
it might be so she said if two prai togeth for if thei prai

meriamun said the pharaoh eagerli for he thought her heart wa move
by piti and sorrow onc thou didst win my crown at the piec wilt

she thought for on moment and then she said
ye i will plai thee my lord but my hand ha lost it cun and
it mai well be that meriamun shall lose again as she ha lost all let
me set the piec and bring wine for my lord
she set the piec and cross the room she lift a great cup of
wine and put it by pharaoh hand but he wa so intent on the game
that he did not drink
he took the field he move she repli and so the game went between
them in the dark fragrant chamber where the lamp burn and the
queen ey shone in the night thi wai and that went the game till
she lost and he swept the board
then in triumph he drain the poison cup of wine and cri pharaoh

rei the priest saw and heard then turn he stole awai through the
madden throng of women and fled with what speed he might from the
templ hi heart wa fill with fear and shame for he knew full well
that pharaoh wa dead not at the hand of hathor but at the hand of
meriamun the queen whom he had love he knew well that dead meneptah
spake not with the voic of the dread god but with the voic of the
magic of meriamun who of all women that have been sinc the dai of
taia wa the most skill in evil magic the lore of the snake he knew
also that meriamun would slai helen for the same caus wherefor she had
slain pharaoh that she might win the wander to her arm while helen

now rei wa a righteou man love the god and good and hate evil
and hi heart burn becaus of the wicked of the woman that onc he
cherish thi he swore that he would do if time were left to him he
would warn the helen so that she might fly the fire if so she will
ay and would tell her all the wicked of meriamun her foe
hi old feet stumbl over each other as he fled till he came to the
gate of the templ of the hathor and knock upon the gate
what wouldst thou old crone ask the priest who sat in the gate
i would be led to the presenc of the hathor he answer

her lone shrine and on her breast gleam the red star of light that
wept the blood of men her head rest on her hand and her heavenli
ey of blue gaze emptili down the empti shrine

last flung himself upon the earth befor her now at length she saw him
and spoke in her voic of music

the last fight of odysseu laert son
now the host of pharaoh march forth from on to do battl with the
ninebow barbarian and befor the host march the captain came to
the wander accord to the command of pharaoh and place their
hand in hi swore to do hi bid on the march and in the battl
thei brought him the great black bow of eurytu and hi keen sword
of bronz euryalu gift and mani a sheaf of arrow and hi heart
rejoic when he saw the goodli weapon he took the bow and tri it
and as he drew the string onc again and for the last time it sang
shrilli of death to be the captain heard the song of the bow though
what it said the wander knew alon for to their ear it came but as
a faint keen cry like the cry of on who drown in the water far from
the kindli earth but thei marvel much at the wonder and said on
to anoth that thi man wa no mortal but a god come from the
underworld
then the wander mount the chariot of bronz that had been made readi
for him and gave the word to march
all night the host march swiftli and at daybreak thei camp beneath
the shelter of a long low hill but at the sunris the wander left
the host climb the hill with certain of the captain and look
forth befor him wa a great pass in the mountain ten furlong or
more in length and through it ran the road the side of the mountain
slope down to the road and were strewn with rock split by the sun
polish by the sand and cover over with bush that grew spars
like the hair on the limb of a man to the left of the mountain lai
the river sihor but none might pass between the mountain and the river
the wander descend from the hill and while the soldier at drove
swiftli in hi chariot to the further end of the pass and look forth
again here the river curv to the left leav a wide plain and on
the plain he saw the host of the ninebow barbarian the mightiest host
that ever hi ey had look upon thei were encamp by nation and
of each nation there wa twenti thousand men and beyond the glitter
camp of the barbarian he saw the curv ship of the achan thei were
drawn up on the beach of the great river as mani a year ago he had seen
them drawn up on the shore that is by ilio he look upon plain and
pass on mountain and river and measur the number of the foe then
hi heart wa fill with the lust of battl and hi warlik cun
awok for of all leader he wa the most skill in the craft of
battl and he desir that thi hi last war should be the greatest
war of all
turn hi hors head he gallop back to the host of pharaoh and
muster them in battl arrai it wa but a littl number as against
the number of the barbarianstwelv thousand spearmen nine thousand
archer two thousand horsemen and three hundr chariot the wander
pass up and down their rank bid them be of good courag for
thi dai thei should sweep the barbarian from the land
as he spoke a hawk flew down from the right and fell on a heron and
slew it in midair the host shout for the hawk is the holi bird of
ra and the wander too rejoic in the omen look men he cri
the bird of ra ha slain the wander thief from the water and so
shall ye smite the spoiler from the sea
then he held counsel with captain and certain trusti men were sent
out to the camp of the barbarian and thei were charg to give an ill
report of the host of pharaoh and to sai that such of it as remain
await the barbarian onset behind the shelter of the hill on the
further side of the pass
then the wander summon the captain of the archer and bade them
hide all their forc among the rock and thorn on either side of the
mountain pass and there to wait till he drew the host of the foe into
the pass and with the archer he sent a part of the spearmen but the
chariot he hid beneath the shelter of the hill on the hither side of
the pass
now when the ambush wa set and all were gone save the horsemen onli
hi spi came in and told him that the host of the barbarian march
from their camp but that the achan march not but stop by the
river to guard the camp and ship then the wander bade the horsemen
ride through the pass and stand in the plain beyond and there await the
foe but when the host of the barbarian charg them thei must reel
befor the charg and at length fly headlong down the pass as though in
fear and he himself would lead the flight in hi chariot and where he
led there thei should follow
so the horsemen rode through the pass and form their squadron on the
plain beyond now the foe drew nigh and a gloriou sight it wa to see
the middai sun sparkl on their countless spear of horsemen thei
had no great number but there were mani chariot and swordsmen and
spearmen and slinger beyond count thei came on by nation and in
the centr of the host of each nation sat the king of the nation in a
gloriou chariot with girl and eunuch hold fan to fan him with
and awn of silk to hide him from the sun
now the wander hung back behind the squadron of horsemen as though
in fear but present he sent messeng bid the captain of the
squadron to charg the first nation and fight for a while but feebli
and then when thei saw him turn hi hors and gallop through the pass
to follow after him as though in doubt but in such fashion as to draw
the foe upon their heel
thi the captain of the mercenari did onc thei charg and were
beaten back then thei charg again but the men made as though thei
fear the onset now the foe came hard after them and the wander
turn hi chariot and fled through the pass follow slowli by the
horsemen and when the host of the barbarian saw them turn thei set
up a mighti shout of laughter that rent the ski and charg after
them
but the wander look back and laugh also now he wa through the
pass follow by the horsemen and after them swept the host of the
barbarian like a river that ha burst it bank still the wander
held hi hand till the whole pass wa choke with the thousand of the
foe ay until the half of the first of the nation had pass into the
narrow plain that lai between the hill and the mouth of the pass then
drive apac up the hill he stood in hi chariot and gave the signal
lift hi golden shield on high he flash it thrice and all the
horsemen shout aloud at the first flash behold from behind everi
rock and bush of the mountain side aros the helm of arm men at the
second flash there came a rattl sound of shaken quiver and at the
third flash of the golden shield the air wa darken with the flight
of arrow as the seabird on a lone isl awak at the cry of the
sailor and wheel by thousand from their lofti cliff so at the third
flash of the wander shield the arrow of hi hidden host rush
downward on the foe rattl like hail upon the har for awhil
thei kept their rank and press on over the bodi of those that
fell but soon the hors in the chariot madden with wound plung
thi wai and that break their compani and trampl the soldier
down now some strove to fly forward and some were fain to fly back
and mani an empti chariot wa drag thi wai and that but ever the
pitiless rain of shaft pour down and men fell by thousand beneath
the gale of death now the mighti host of the ninebow roll back
thin and shatter toward the plain and now the wander cri the
word of onset to the horsemen and to the chariot that drew from behind
the shelter of the hill and follow after him thei charg down upon
those barbarian who had pass the ambush sing the song of pentaur
as thei charg among those nigh the mouth of the pass wa the king
of the nation of the libu a great man black and terribl to see the
wander drew hi bow the arrow rush forth and pierc the king
and he fell dead in hi chariot then those of hi host who pass the
ambush turn to fly but the chariot of the wander dash into them
and after the chariot came the horsemen and after the horsemen the
chariot of pharaoh
now all who were left of the broken host roll back mad with fear
while the spearmen of pharaoh gall them as hunter gall a fly
bull and the horsemen of pharaoh trampl them beneath their feet red
slaughter rage all down the pass helm banner arrowpoint shone
and fell in the stream of the tide of war but at length the stoni wai
wa clear save for the dead alon beyond the pass the plain wa black
with fly men and the fragment of the broken nation were mix
togeth as clai and sand ar mix of the potter where now were the
host of the ninebow barbarian where now were their glori and their
pride
the wander gather hi footmen and hi chariot and set them in arrai
again but the horsemen he sent out to smite the fly nation and wait
hi come by the camp for there were muster those who were left of
the nation perchanc twenti thousand men and befor their ship were
rang the dens rank of the achan shield to shield everi man in
hi place
the wander led hi host slowli across the sandi plain till at length
he halt it two bowshot from the camp of the barbarian the camp wa
shape like a bow and the river sihor form it string and round it
wa a deep ditch and beyond the ditch a wall of clai moreov within
the camp and nearer to the shore there wa a second ditch and wall and
behind it were the beak of the ship and the host of aquaiusha even
of hi own dear peopl the achan there were the old blazon and
the spear that had fought below troi town there were the two lion of
mycen the centaur of the son of polypaeta son of pirith there
were the swan of lacedmon and the bull of the king of crete the rose
of rhode the serpent of athen and mani anoth knightli bear of
old friend and kindr dear and now thei were the blazon of foemen
and the wander war for a strang king and for hi own hand
beneath the wing of the hawk of the legion of ra
the wander sent herald forward call to those barbarian who
swarm behind the wall to surrend to the host of pharaoh but thi
be entrench by the river sihor thei would in nowis do for thei
were mad becaus of their slaughter thousand and moreov thei knew
that it is better to die than to live as slave thi thei saw also
that their host wa still as strong as the host of pharaoh which wa
without the wall and weari with the heat and stress of battl and the
toil of march through the desert sand now the captain of the host
of pharaoh came to the wander prai him that he would do no more
battl on that dai becaus the men were weari and the hors neigh
for food and water
but he answer them i swore to pharaoh that i would utterli smite the
peopl of the ninebow and drive them down to death so that the coast
of khem mai be free of them here i mai not camp the host without food
or pastur for the hors and if i go back the foe will gather heart
and come on and with them the fleet of the achan and no more shall
we lure them into ambush for therein thei have learn a lesson nai
get you to your compani i will go up against the camp
then thei bow and went for have seen hi deed and hi skill and
craft in war thei held him the first of captain and dare not sai him
nai
so the wander divid hi host into three part set it in order of
battl and move up against the camp but he himself went with the
centr part against the gate of the camp for here there wa an earthen
wai for chariot if but the great gate might be pass and at a word
the threefold host rush on to the charg but those within the wall
shot them with spear and arrow so that mani were slain and thei were
roll back from the wall as a wave is roll from the cliff again the
wander bade them charg on the right and left bear the dead befor
them as shield and hurl corps into the ditch to fill it but he
himself hung back awhil with the middl armi watch how the battl
went and wait till the foe at the gate should be drawn awai
now the mercenari of pharaoh forc a passag on the right and thither
went mani of the barbarian who watch the gate that thei might drive
them back
then the wander bade men take out the pole of chariot and follow
him and beat down the gate with the pole thi with much toil and loss
thei did for the archer pour their arrow on the assail of the
gate now at length the gate were down and the wander rush through
them with hi chariot but even as he pass the mercenari of pharaoh
were driven out from the camp on the right and those who led the left
attack fled also the soldier who should have follow the wander saw
and waver a littl moment and while thei waver the compani of the
barbarian pour into the gatewai and held it so that none might pass
now the wander wa left alon within the camp and back he might not
go but fear came not nigh him nai the joi of battl fill hi mighti
heart he cast hi shield upon the brazen floor of the chariot and
cri aloud to the chariot as he loosen the long grei shaft in
hi quiver
drive on thou chariot drive on the jackal leav the lion in the
toil drive on drive on and win a gloriou death for thu should
odysseu die
so the chariot prai to hi god lash the hors with hi
scourg and thei sprang forward madli among the foe and as thei
rush the great bow rang and sang the swallow stringrung the bow and
sung the string and the lean shaft drank the blood of a leader of men
again the string sang again the shaft sped forth and a barbarian king
fell from hi chariot as a diver plung into the sea and hi teeth bit
the sand
dive deep thou seathief cri the wander thou mayest find
treasur there drive on thou chariot so should lion die while
jackal watch
now the barbarian look on the wander and were amaz for ever hi
chariot rush to and fro across the muster ground of the camp and
ever hi grei shaft carri death befor them and ever the foemen
arrow fell blunt from hi golden har thei look on him amaz
thei cri aloud that thi wa the god of war come down to do battl for
khem that it wa sutek the splendid that it wa baal in hi strength
thei fled amain befor hi glori and hi might for the wander rage
among them like great rames miamun among the tribe of the khita like
monthu the lord of battl and lo thei fled befor him their knee
gave wai their heart were turn to water he drove them as a herdsman
drive the yearl calv
but now at length a stone from a sling smote the chariot who direct
the chariot and sunk in between hi ey so that he fell down dead
from the chariot then the rein flew wide and the hors rush thi
wai and that have no master and now a spear pierc the heart of the
hors on the right so that he fell and the pole of the chariot snap
in two then the barbarian took heart and turn and some of them
set on to seiz the bodi of the chariot and spoil hi arm but the
wander leap down and bestrod the corps with shield up and spear
aloft
now among the press of the barbarian there wa a stir as of on
thrust hi wai through them to the front and abov the plume of
their helmet and the toss of their shield the wander saw the
golden head unhelmet of a man taller than the tallest there from
the shoulder upward unhelmet he came and unshield with no
bodi armour hi flesh wa veri fair and white and on it were figur
prick in blue figur of men and hors snake and seabeast the
skin of a white bear wa buckl abov hi shoulder with a golden clasp
fashion in the semblanc of a boar hi ey were blue fierc and
shine and in hi hand he held for a weapon the trunk of a young
pinetre in which wa haft a weighti axehead of rough unpolish
stone
give wai he cri give place ye duski dwarf and let a man see
thi champion
so the barbarian made a circl about the wander and the giant and
stood silent to watch a great fight
who art thou said the mighti man disdainfulli and whenc where is
thy citi and thy parent who begat thee
now i will avow that men call me odysseu sacker of citi laert
son a princ of the achan said the wander and who art thou
i prai thee and where is thy nativ place for citi i wot thou hast
none
then the mighti man swing hi great stone ax in a rhythmic motion
began to chant a rude lai and thi wa the manner of the sing
laestrygon men

with that and with a cry he rush on the wander hi great ax
swung aloft to fell him at a blow
but while the giant had been sing the wander had shift hi place
a littl so that the red blaze of the set sun wa in hi face and
as the mighti man came on the wander lift up hi golden shield and
caught the sunlight on it and flash it full in the giant ey
so that he wa dazzl and could not see to strike then the wander
smote at hi nake right arm and struck it on the joint of the elbow
with all hi forc he smote and the short sword of euryalu bit deep
and the arm fell with the ax in the handgrip but so terribl wa the
stroke that bronz might not abid it and the blade wa shatter from
the ivori handl
didst thou feel aught thou maneat cri odysseu jeer for he
knew from the song of the giant that he wa face to face with a wander
from an evil race that of old had smitten hi ship and devour hi
menth laestrygon of the land of the midnight sun the maneat
but the giant caught up hi club of pinetre in hi left hand the
sever right arm still cling to it and he gnaw on the handl
of the stone ax with hi teeth and bit the veri stone and hi lip
foam for a furi came upon him roar aloud suddenli he smote at
the wander head and beat down hi shield and crush hi golden
helm so that he fell on on knee and all wa dark around him but
hi hand lit on a great stone for the place where thei fought wa the
holi place of an ancient templ old and ruin befor king mena dai
he grasp the stone with both hand it wa the basalt head of a fallen
statu of a god or a man of a king long nameless or of a forgotten
god with a mighti strain the wander lift it as he rose it wa a
weight of a chariot burden and pois it he hurl it straight
at the breast of the laestrygon who had drawn back whirl hi ax
befor he smote anoth blow but er ever the stroke fell the huge
stone struck him full and broke in hi breast bone and he stagger
long and fell like a tree and the black blood came up through hi
beard lip and hi life left him
then the multitud of the barbarian that stood gaze at the frai drew
yet further back in fear and the wander laugh like a god at
that old score paid and at the last great stroke of the hand of the
citysack odysseu
viii
till odysseu come
the wander laugh like a god though he deem that the end wa near
and the foe within the camp and the friend without look on him and
wonder
slai him cri the foe within speak in mani tongu slai him
thei cri and yet thei fear the task but circl round like hound
about a mighti boar at bai
spare him shout the host of the achan watch the frai from
far as thei stood behind their inner wall for as yet thei had not
mingl in the battl but stai by their ship to guard them
rescu cri the captain of pharaoh without but none came on to
forc the wai
then of a sudden as fate hung upon the turn a great cry of fear and
wonder rose from the rank of pharaoh host beyond the wall it swell
and swell till at length the cry took the sound of a nameth sound
of the name of hathor
the hathor the hathor see the hathor come
the wander turn hi head and look swiftli a golden chariot sped
down the slope of sand toward the gate of the camp the milkwhit
hors were stain with sweat and splash with blood thei thunder
on toward the gate down the wai that wa red with blood as the hors
of the dawn rush through the bloodr sky a littl man wither and
old drove the chariot lean forward as he drove and by hi side
stood the golden helen the red star blaze upon her breast her hair
and filmi robe float on the wind
she look up and forth now she saw him odysseu of ithaca her love
alon beset with foe and a cry broke from her she tore awai the veil
that hid her face and her beauti flash out upon the sight of men as
the moon flash from the even mist she point to the gate she
stretch out her arm toward the host of pharaoh bid them look
upon her and follow her then a shout went up from the host and thei
rush onward in the path of the chariot for where the helen lead
there men must follow through life to death through war to peac
on the chariot rush to the camp and after it the host of pharaoh
follow the holder of the gate saw the beauti of her who rode in the
chariot thei cri aloud in mani tongu that the goddess of love
had come to save the god of war thei fled thi wai and that or stood
drunken with the sight of beauti and were dash down by the hors and
crush of the chariot wheel now she had pass the gate and after
her pour the host of pharaoh now rei rein up the hors by the
broken chariot of the wander and now the wander with a shout of
joi had sprung into the chariot of helen
and art thou come to be with me in my last battl he whisper in her
ear art thou inde that argiv helen whom i love or am i drunk with
the blood of men and blind with the sheen of spear and is thi the
vision of a man doom to die
it is no vision odysseu for i am helen self she answer gentli
i have learn all the truth and know thy fault count it but a
littl thing yet becaus thou didst forget the word of the immort
goddess who be my foe now and for ever set thi cun snare for
thee the doom is on thee that helen shall not be thine in thi space
of life for thou fightest in thy last battl odysseu on see thy
host clamour to be led and there the foe hang black as storm and
shoot out the lightn of hi spear on odysseu on that the doom
mai be accomplish and the word of the ghost fulfil
then the wander turn and call to the captain and the captain
call to the soldier and set them in arrai and follow the
bloodr star thei roll down upon the gather foe as the tide roll
upon the rock when the breath of the gale is strong and as the water
leap and gather till the rock ar lost in the surg so the host
of pharaoh leapt upon the foe and swallow them up and ever in the
forefront of the war blaze the red star on helen breast and ever the
sound of her sing pierc the din of death
now the host of the ninebow barbarian wa utterli destroi and the
host of pharaoh came up against the wall that wa set about the camp
of the achan to guard their ship and at it head came the golden
chariot wherein were the wander and helen the captain of the achan
look wonder from their wall watch the slaughter of their
alli
now who is thi cri a captain who is thi clad in golden armour
fashion like our own who lead the host of pharaoh to victori
then a certain ag leader of men look forth and answer
such armour i have known inde and such a man onc wore it the
armour is fashion like the armour of pari priam sonpari of
ilio but pari hath long been dead
and who is she cri the captain she on whose breast a red star
burn who ride in the chariot of him with the golden armour whose
shape is the shape of beauti and who sing aloud while men go down to
death
then the ag leader of men look forth again and answer
such a on have i known inde so she wa wont to sing and her wa
such a shape of beauti and such a star shone ever on her breast helen
of iliosarg helen it wa who wore ithelen becaus of whose
loveli the world grew dark with death but long is helen dead
now the wander glanc from hi chariot and saw the crest of the
achan and the devic on the shield of men with whose father he
had fought beneath the wall of ilio he saw and hi heart wa stir
within him so that he wept there in the chariot
ala for the fate that is on me he cri that i must make my
last battl in the servic of a stranger against my own peopl and the
children of my own dear friend
weep not odysseu said helen for fate drive thee onfat that is
cruel and changeless and heed not the love or hate of men weep
not odyssei but go on up against the achan for from among them thy
death come
so the wander went on sick at heart shoot no shaft and strike
no blow and after him came the remnant of the host of pharaoh then
he halt the host and at hi bid rei drove slowli down the wall
seek a place to storm it and as he drove thei shot at the chariot
from the wall with spear and sling and arrow but not yet wa the
wander doom he took no hurt nor did ani hurt come to rei nor to
the hors that drew the chariot and as for helen the shaft of
death knew her and turn asid now while thei drove thu rei told
the wander of the death of pharaoh of the burn of the templ of
hathor and of the flight of helen the wander hearken and said but
on thing for in all thi he saw the hand of fate
it is time to make an end rei for soon will meriamun be seek
us and methink that i have left a trail that she can follow and he
nod at the piledup dead that stretch further than the ey could
reach
now thei were come over against that spot in the wall where stood the
ag captain of the achan who had liken the armour of the wander
to the armour of pari and the beauti of her at hi side to the beauti
of argiv helen
the captain loos hi bow at the chariot and lean forward watch
the flight of the shaft it rush straight at helen breast then of a
sudden turn asid harm her not and as he marvel she lift
her face and look toward him then he saw and knew her for that helen
whom he had seen while he serv with cretan idomeneu in the argiv
ship when the leaguer wa done and the smoke went up from burn
ilio
again he look and lo on the wander golden shield he saw the
white bull the devic of pari son of priam as ofttim he had seen
it glitter on the wall of troi then great fear took him and he lift
up hi hand and cri aloud
fly ye achan fly back to your curv ship and awai from thi
accurs land for yonder in the chariot stand argiv helen who is
long dead and with her pari son of priam come to wreak the woe
of ilio on the son of those who wast her fly er the curs smite
you
then a great cry of fear rose from the host of the achan as compani
call to compani that the ghost of pari of ilio and argiv helen led
the armi of pharaoh on to victori a moment thei gaze as frighten
sheep gaze upon the creep wolv then turn from the wall thei
rush headlong to their ship
behind them came the soldier of pharaoh storm the wall and tear
at their flank as wolv tear the fly sheep then the achan turn
at bai and a mighti frai rage round the ship and the knee of mani
were loosen and of the ship some were burn and some were left
upon the bank but a remnant of them were push off into the deep
water and hung there on their oar wait for the end of the frai
now the sun wa gone down so that men could scarc see to slai each
other the wander stood hi chariot on the bank watch the battl
for he wa weari and had littl mind to swell the slaughter of the
peopl of hi own land
now the last ship wa push off and at length the great battl
wa done but among those on the ship wa a man still young and the
goodliest and mightiest among all the host of the achan by hi own
strength and valour he had held the egyptian back while hi comrad
ran the curv ship down the beach and the wander look on him
deem him their hardiest warrior and most worthi of the achan
he stood upon the poop of the ship and saw the light from the burn
vessel gleam on the wander golden helm then of a sudden he drew a
mighti bow and loos an arrow charg with death
thi gift to the ghost of pari from telegonu son of circ and of
odysseu who wa pari foe he cri with a loud voic
and as he cri it and as the fate word struck on the ear of
odysseu and the ear of helen the shaft point by the god rush
on it rush on it smote the wander with a deadli wound where the
golden bodypl of hi har join the taslet and pierc him
through then he knew that hi fate wa accomplish and that death
came upon him from the water as the ghost of tiresia in hade had
foretold in hi pain for the last time of all he let fall hi shield
and the black bow of eurytu with on hand he clasp the rail of the
chariot and the other he threw about the neck of the golden helen who
bent beneath hi weight like a lili befor the storm then he also cri
aloud in answer
oh telegonu son of circ what wicked hast thou wrought befor
the aw god that thi curs should have been laid upon thee to slai
him who begat thee hearken thou son of circ i am not pari i am
odysseu of ithaca who begat thee and thou hast brought my death upon
me from the water as the ghost foretold
when telegonu heard these word and knew that he had slain hi father
the fame odysseu whom he had sought the whole world through he would
have cast himself into the river there to drown but those with him
held him by strength and the stream took the curv ship and float
it awai and thu for the first and last time did the god give it
to telegonu to look upon the face and hear the voic of hi father
odysseu
but when the achan knew that it wa the lost odysseu who had led the
host of pharaoh against the armi of the nine nation thei wonder
no more at the skill of the ambush and the great of the victori of
pharaoh
now the chariot of meriamun were pursu and thei splash through
the blood of men in the pass and roll over the bodi of men in the
plain beyond the pass thei came to the camp and found them peopl
with dead and lit with the lamp of the blaze ship of the aquaiusha
then meriamun cri aloud
sure pharaoh grew wise befor he di for there is but on man on
the earth who with so small a forc could have won so great a frai he
hath save the crown of khem and by osiri he shall wear it
now the chariot of meriamun had pass the camp of the barbarian and
were come to the inner camp of the achan and the soldier shout as
she came drive furious
the wander lai dy on the ground there by the riverbank and the
light of the burn ship flame on hi golden armour and on the star
at helen breast
why do the soldier shout he ask lift hi head from helen
breast
thei shout becaus meriamun the queen is come rei answer

now meriamun sprang from her chariot and walk through the soldier
who made wai bow befor her royalti to where the wander lai and
stood speechless look on him
but the wander lift hi head spake faintli

love and war and wander my death ha come upon me from the
water
meriamun stood speechless for her heart wa torn in two so that in her
grief she forgot even her rage against helen and rei the priest
then helen spoke thou diest inde odysseu yet it is but for a
littl time for thou shalt come again and find me wait

other world than thi and shall endur till evil is lost in good and
dark swallow up in light bethink thee meriamun of that vision
of thy bridal night and read it riddl lo i will answer it with my
last breath as the god have given me wisdom when we three ar onc

veil be drawn from the face of truth oh helen fare thee well i have
sin against thee i have sworn by the snake who should have sworn by
the star and therefor i have lost thee

answer low
then she bent down and take him in her arm kiss him whisper
in hi ear and the blood of men that fell ever from the star upon her
breast drop like dew upon hi brow and vanish as it drop
and as she whisper of joi to be and thing too holi to be written
the face of the wander grew bright like the face of a god
then suddenli hi head fell back and he wa dead dead upon the heart
of the world desir for thu wa fulfil the oath of idalian
aphrodit and thu at the last did odysseu lie in the arm of the
golden helen
now meriamun clasp her breast and her lip turn white with pain
but helen rose and stand at the wander head look on meriamun
who stood at hi feet
my sister said helen to the queen see now the end of all he whom
we love is lost to us and what hast thou gain nai look not so
fierc on me i mai not be harm of thee as thou hast seen and thou
mayest not be harm of me who would harm none though ever thou wilt
hate me who hate thee not and till thou learnest to love me sin shall
be thy portion and bitter thy comfort
but meriamun spoke no word
then helen beckon to rei and spake to him and rei went weep to do
her bid
present he return again and with him were soldier bear torch
the soldier lift up the bodi of the wander and bore it to a mighti
pyre that wa built up of the wealth of the barbarian of chariot
spear and the oar of ship of wondrou fabric and costli
furnitur and thei laid the wander on the pyre and on hi breast
thei laid the black bow of eurytu
then helen spoke to rei onc more and rei took a torch and fire the
pyre so that smoke and flame burst from it and all the while meriamun
stood by as on who dream
now the great pyre wa a mass of flame and the golden armour of the
wander shone through the flame and the black bow twist and crumbl
in the heat then of a sudden meriamun gave a great cry and tear the
snake girdl from her middl hurl it on the flame
from fire thou camest thou ancient evil she said in a dead tongu
to fire get thee back again fals counsellor
but rei the priest call aloud in the same tongu
an ill deed thou hast done o queen for thou hast taken the snake to
thy bosom and where the snake pass there thou must follow
even as he spoke the face of meriamun grew fix and she wa drawn
slowli toward the fire as though by invis hand now she stood on
it veri brink and now with on loud wail she plung into it and cast
herself at length on the bodi of the wander
and as she lai there on the bodi behold the snake awok in the fire it
awok it grew it twine itself about the bodi of meriamun and the bodi
of the wander and lift it head it laugh
then the fire fell in and the wander and meriamun the queen and the
snake that wrap them round vanish in the heart of the flame
for awhil the golden helen stood still look on the dy fire then
she let her veil fall and turn wander forth into the desert and
the night sing as she pass
and so she goe wander wander till odysseu come again
now thi is the tale that i rei the priest have been bidden to set
forth befor i lai me down to sleep in my splendid tomb that i have made
readi by thebe let everi man read it as he will and everi woman as
the god have given her wit
