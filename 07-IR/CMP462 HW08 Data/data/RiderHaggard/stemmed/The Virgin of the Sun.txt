introductori
there ar some who find great interest and even consol amid the
worri and anxieti of life in the collect of relic of the past
drift or longsunk treasur that the sea of time ha wash up upon our
modern shore
the great collector ar not of thi class have larg sum at their
dispos these acquir ani rariti that come upon the market and add
it to their store which in due cours perhap immedi upon their
death also will be put upon the market and pass to the possess of
other connoisseur nor ar the dealer who bui to sell again and thu
grow wealthi nor ar the agent of museum in mani land who purchas
for the nation benefit thing that ar gather togeth in certain
great public build which perhap some dai though the thought
make on shiver will be loot or given to the flame by enemi or by
furiou thiev mob
those that thi editor ha in mind from on of whom inde he obtain
the histori print in these page belong to a quit differ
categori men of small mean often who collect old thing for the most
part at outofthewai sale or privat becaus thei love them and
sometim sell them again becaus thei must frequent these old thing
appeal not becaus of ani intrins valu that thei mai have not
even for their beauti for thei mai be quit unattract even to the
cultiv ey but rather for their associ such folk love to
reflect upon and to specul about the longdead individu who have
own the relic who have sup their soup from the worn elizabethan
spoon who have sat at the ricketi oak tabl found in a kitchen or an
outhous or upon the broken ancient chair thei love to think of the
littl children whose skil tire hand wrought the fade sampler and
whose bright ey smart over it innumer stitch
who for instanc wa the mai shore fairi broider in a bracket
underneath wa her pet name who finish yonder elabor exampl on
her tenth birthdai the 1st of maydoubtless that is where she got
her namein the year 1702 and on what far shore doe she keep her
birthdai now none will ever know she ha vanish into the great
sea of mysteri whenc she came and there she live and ha her be
forgotten upon earth or sleep and sleep and sleep did she die young
or old marri or singl did she ever set her children to work other
sampler or had she none wa she happi or unhappi wa she home or
beauti wa she a sinner or a saint again none will ever know she
wa born on the 1st of mai 1692 and certainli she di on some date
unrecord so far as human knowledg goe that is all her histori just
as much or as littl as will be left of most of us who breath todai
when thi earth ha complet two hundr and eighteen more revolut
round the sun
but the kind of collector allud to can best be exemplifi in the
individu instanc of him from whom the manuscript wa obtain of
which a somewhat modern version is print on these page he ha
been dead some year leav no kin and under hi will such of hi
motlei treasur as it care to accept went to a local museum while
the rest and hi other properti were sold for the benefit of a mystic
brotherhood for the old fellow wa a kind of spiritualist therefor
there is no harm in give hi plebeian name which wa pott mr
pott had a small draper shop in an undistinguish and rare visit
countri town in the east of england which shop he ran with the help
of an assist almost as old and peculiar as himself whether he made
anyth out of it or whether he live upon privat mean is now unknown
and doe not matter anywai when there wa someth of antiquarian
interest or valu to be bought gener he had the monei to pai for
it though at time in order to do so he wa forc to sell someth
els inde these were the onli occas when it wa possibl to
purchas anyth indiffer hosieri except from mr pott
now i the editor who also love old thing and to whom therefor mr
pott wa a sympathet soul wa awar of thi fact and enter into
an arrang with the peculiar assist to whom i have allud to
advis me of such crise which aros whenev the local bank call mr
pottss attent to the state of hi account thu it came about that
on dai i receiv the follow letter
sir
the guvnor ha gone a bust upon some crack china the ugliest that
ever i saw though no judg so if you want to get that old tall clock at
the first price or ani other of hi rubbish i think now is your chanc
anyhow keep thi dark as per agreement
your obedi tom
he alwai sign himself tom i suppos to mystifi although i believ
hi real name wa betterli
the result of thi epistl wa a long and disagre bicycl ride in
wet autumn weather and a visit to the shop of mr pott tom alia
betterli who wa try to sell some mysteri undergar to a fat
old woman caught sight of me the editor aforesaid and wink in a
shadow corner of the shop sat mr pott himself upon a high stool a
wizen littl old man with a bent back a bald head and a hook
nose upon which were set a pair of enorm hornrim spectacl that
accentu hi gener resembl to an owl perch upon the edg of
it nesthol he wa busili engag in do noth and in stare
into nothing as accord to tom wa hi habit when commun with
what he tom call hi drat speerit
custom said tom in a harsh voic sorri to disturb you at your
prayer guvnor but not have two pair of hand i cant serv a
crowd mean the old woman of the undergar and myself
mr pott slid off hi stool and prepar for action when he saw
howev who the custom wa he bristledthat is the onli word for it
the truth is that although between us there wa an inward and spiritu
sympathi there wa also an outward and visibl hostil twice i
had outbid mr pott at a local auction for articl which he desir
moreov after the fashion of everi good collector he felt it to be
hi duti to hate me as anoth collector lastli sever time i
had offer him smaller sum for antiqu upon which he set a certain
monetari valu it is true that long ago i had given up thi bargain
for the reason that mr pott would never take less than he ask
inde he follow the exampl of the vendor of the sibyllin book in
ancient rome he did not destroi the good inde after the fashion
of that person and demand the price of all of them for the on that
remain but invari he put up hi figur by 10 per cent and
noth would induc him to take off on farth
what do you want sir he said grumpili vest hose collar or
sock
oh sock i think i repli at hazard think that thei would
be easiest to carri whereupon mr pott produc some peculiarli
objection and shapeless woollen articl which he almost threw at
me sai that thei were all he had in stock now i detest woollen
sock and never wear them still i made a purchas think with
sympathi of my old garden whose feet thei would soon be scratch
and while the parcel wa be ti up said in an insinu voic
anyth fresh upstair mr pott
no sir he answer shortli at least not much and if there were
what the us of show them to you after the busi about that
clock
it wa 15 you want for it mr pott i ask
no sir it wa 17 and now it 10 per cent on to that you can work
out the sum for yourself
well let have anoth look at it mr pott i repli humbl
whereon with a grunt and a mutter injunct to tom to mind the shop
he led the wai upstair
now the hous in which mr pott dwelt had onc been of consider
pretens and wa veri veri old elizabethan i should think
although it had been refront with a horribl stucco to suit modern
tast the oak staircas wa good though narrow and led to numer
small room upon two floor abov some of which room were panel
and had oak beam now whitewash like the panellingat least thei had
onc been whitewash probabl in the last gener
these room were liter cram with everi sort of old furnitur
most of it decrepit though for mani of the articl dealer would have
given a good price but at dealer mr pott drew the line not on of
them had ever set a foot upon that oaken stair to the attic the place
wa fill with thi furnitur and other articl such as book china
sampler with the glass broken and i know not what besid pile in
heap upon the floor inde where mr pott slept wa a mysteri either
it must have been under the counter in hi shop or perhap at night he
inhabit a wormeaten jacobean bedstead which stood in an attic for
i observ a kind of pathwai to it run through a number of legless
chair also some dirti blanket between the mothriddl curtain
not far from thi bedstead prop in an intox wai against the
slope wall of the old hous stood the clock which i desir it wa
on of the first regul clock with a wooden pendulum us by the
maker himself to check the timekeep of all hi other clock and
enclos in a chast and perfect mahogani case of the veri best style of
it period so beauti wa it inde that it had been an instanc of
love at first sight between us and although there wa an estrang
on the matter of settlement or in other word over the question of
price now i felt that never more could that clock and i be part
so i agre to give old pott the 20 or to be accur 18 14 which
he ask on the 10 per cent rise principl thank in my heart that
he had not made it more and prepar to go as i turn howev my
ey fell upon a larg chest of the almost indestruct yellow cypress
wood of which were made it is said the door of st peter at rome
that stood for eight hundr year and for aught i know ar still
stand as good as on the dai when thei were put up
marriag coffer said pott answer my unspoken question
italian about 1600 i suggest
mai be so or perhap dutch made by italian artist but older than
that for somebodi ha burnt 1597 on the lid with a hot iron not for
sale not for sale at all much too good to sell just you look insid
it the old kei is ti to the spring lock never saw such pokerwork in
my life god and goddess and i dont know what and venu sit
in the middl in a wreath of flower with noth on and hold two
heart in her hand which show that it wa a marriag chest onc it
wa full of some bride outfit sheet and linen and cloth and god
know what i wonder where she ha got to todai some place where the
moth dont eat cloth i hope bought it at the breakup of an
ancient famili who fled to norfolk on the revoc of the edict of
nanteshuguenot of cours year ago year ago havent look into
it for mani year inde but think there noth there but rubbish
now
thu he mumbl on while he found and unti the old kei the spring
lock had grown stiff from disus and want of oil but at length it
turn and reopen the chest reveal the pokerwork glori on the
inner side of the lid and elsewher glori thei were inde never had
i seen such artistri of the sort
cant see it properli mutter pott window want wash havent
been done sinc my wife di and that twenti year ago miss her
veri much of cours but thank god there no springclean now the
thing iv seen broken in springclean ye and lost too it wa
after on of them that i told my wife that now i understood why the
mahomedan declar that women have no soul when she came to understand
what i meant which it took her a long time to do we had a row a
regular row and she threw a dresden figur at my head luckili i caught
it have been a cricket when young well she gone now and no
doubt heaven a tidier place than it us to bethat is if thei will
stand her rummag there which i doubt look at that venu aint she
a beauti might have been done by titian when hi paint ran out and
he had to take to a hot iron to express hi art what you cant see
her well wait a bit and ill get a lantern cant have a nake candl
hereth too valuabl no monei could bui them again my wife and
i had anoth row about nake candl or it mai have been a paraffin
lamp you sit in that old prayerstool and look at the work
off he went crawl down the duski stair and leav me wonder
what mr pott of whom now i heard for the first time could have been
like an aggrav woman i felt sure for upon whatev point men
differ as to springclean thei ar all of on mind no doubt he
wa better without her for what did that driedup old artist want with
a wife
dismiss mr pott from my mind which to tell the truth seem
to have no room for her shadowi and hypothet entiti i fell to
examin the chest oh it wa love in two minut the clock wa
depos and that chest becam the sultana in my seraglio of beauteou
thing the clock had onli been the light love of an hour here wa
the etern queen that is unless there exist a still better chest
somewher els and i should happen to find it meanwhil whatev
price that old slavedeal pott want for it must be paid to him
even if i had to overdraw my somewhat slender account seraglio of
whatev sort it must be rememb ar expens luxuri of the rich
inde though if of antiqu thei can be sold again which cannot be
said of the human kind for who want to bui a lot of antiqu frump
there were plenti of thing in the chest such as some odd and end of
tapestri and old cloth of a queen ann charact put here no doubt
for preserv as moth doe not like thi cypress wood also there
were some book and a mysteri bundl ti up in a curiou shawl with
stripe of colour run through it that bundl excit me and i drew
the fring of the shawl apart and look in so far as i could see it
contain anoth dress of rich colour also a thick packet of what
look like parchment badli prepar and much rot upon on side
as though by damp which parchment appear to be cover with faint
blacklett write done by some careless scribe with poor ink that
had fade veri much there were other thing too within the shawl
such as a box made of some red foreign wood but i had not time to
investig further for just then i heard old pottss foot upon the
stair and thought it best to replac the bundl he arriv with the
lantern and by it light we examin the chest and the poker work
veri nice i said veri nice though a good deal knock about
ye sir he repli with sarcasm i suppos youd like to see it
neat and new after four hundr year of wear and if so i think i can
tell you where you can get on to your like i made the design for
it myself five year ago for a fellow who want to learn how to
manufactur antiqu he in quod now and hi antiqu ar for sale
cheap i help to put him there to get him out of the wai as a danger
to societi
what the price i ask with airi detach
havent i told you it aint for sale wait till im dead and come and
bui it at my auction no you wont though for it go somewher
els
i made no answer but continu my examin while pott took hi
seat on the prayerstool and seem to go off into on of hi fit of
abstract
well i said at length when decenc told me that i could remain no
longer if you wont sell it no us my look no doubt you want to
keep it for a richer man and of cours you ar quit right will you
arrang with the carrier about send the clock mr pott and i will
let you have a chequ now i must be off as iv ten mile to ride and
it will be dark in an hour
stop where you ar said pott in a hollow voic what a ride in
the dark compar with a matter like thi even if you havent a lamp
and get haul befor your own bench stop where you ar im listen
to someth
so i stop and began to fill my pipe
put that pipe awai said pott come out of hi reveri pipe mean
match no match here
i obei and he went on think till at last what between the chest
and the wormeaten jacobean bed and old pott on the prayerstool i
began to feel as if i were be mesmer at length he rose and said
in the same hollow voic
young man you mai have that chest and the price is 50 now for
heaven sake dont offer me 40 or it will be 100 befor you leav
thi room
with the content i said casual
ye with the content it the content im told you ar to have
look here pott i said exasper what the devil do you mean
there no on in thi room except you and me so who can have told you
anyth unless it wa old tom downstair
tom he said with unutter sarcasm tom perhap you mean the
mawkin that wa put up to scare bird from the pea in the garden for
it ha more in it head than tom no on here oh what fool some men
ar why the place is thick with them
thick with whom
who why ghost of cours as you would call them in your ignor
spirit of the dead i name them beauti enough too some of them
look at that on there and he lift the lantern and point to a pile
of old bed post of chippendal design
good dai pott i said hastili
stop where you ar repeat pott you dont believ me yet but
when you ar as old as i am you will rememb my word and believemor
than i do and seeclear than i do becaus it in your soul ye
the seed is in your soul though as yet it is choke by the world the
flesh and the devil wait till your sin have brought you troubl wait
till the fire of troubl have burn the flesh awai wait till you have
sought light and found light and live in light then you will believ
then you will see
all thi he said veri solemnli and stand there in that duski room
surround by the wreck of thing that onc had been dear to dead men
and women wave the lantern in hi hand and staringat what wa he
staringr old pott look most impress hi twist shape and
ugli counten becam spiritu he wa on who had found light and
live in light
you wont believ me he went on but i pass on to you what a woman
ha been tell me she a queer sort of woman i never saw her
like befor a foreign and darkhu with strang rich garment and
someth on her head there that that and he point through the
dirti windowplac to the crescent of a young moon which appear in
the sky a fine figur of a woman he went on and oh heaven what
eyesi never saw such ey befor big and tender someth like those
of the deer in the park yonder proud too she is on who ha rule
and a ladi though foreign well i never fell in love befor but i
feel like it now and so would you young man if you could see her and
so i think did someon els in hi dai
what did she sai to you i ask for by now i wa interest enough
who wouldnt be when old pott took to describ beauti women
it a littl difficult to tell you for she spoke in a strang tongu
and i had to translat it in my head as it were but thi is the gist
of it that you were to have that chest and what wa in it there a
write there she sai or part of a write for some ha gonerot
awai you ar to read that write or to get it read and to print it so
that the world mai read it also she said that hubert wish you to
do so i am sure the name wa hubert though she also spoke of him with
some other titl which i do not understand that all i can rememb
except someth about a citi ye a citi of gold and a last great
battl in which hubert fell cover with glori and conquer i
understood that she want to talk about that becaus it isnt in the
write but you interrupt and of cours she gone ye the price is
50 and not a farth less but you can pai it when you like for i know
your as honest as most and whether you pai it or not you must have
that chest and what in it and no on els
all right i said but dont trust it to the carrier ill send a
cart for it tomorrow morn lock it now and give me the kei
in due cours the chest arriv and i examin the bundl for the other
content do not matter although some of them were interest pin
insid the shawl i found a paper undat and unsign but which from
the charact and style of the write wa i should sai pen by a
ladi about sixti year ago it ran thu
my late father who wa such a great travel in hi young dai and so
fond of explor strang place brought these thing home from on of
hi journei befor hi marriag i think from south america he told
me onc that the dress wa found upon the bodi of a woman in a tomb and
that she must have been a great ladi for she wa surround by a number
of other women perhap her servant who were brought to be buri with
her here when thei di thei were all seat about a stone tabl at the
end of which were the remain of a man my father saw the bodi near
the ruin of some forest citi in the tomb over which wa heap a great
mound of earth that of the ladi which had a kind of shroud made of the
skin of longwool sheep wrap about it as though to preserv the
dress beneath had been embalm in some wai which the nativ of the
place wherev it wa told him show that she wa royal the other
were mere skeleton held togeth by the skin but the man had a long
fair beard and hair still hang to hi skull and by hi side wa a
great crosshilt sword that crumbl to fragment when it wa touch
except the hilt and the knob of amber upon it which had turn almost
black with ag i think my father said that the packet of skin or
parchment of which the undersid is badli rot with damp wa set under
the feet of the man he told me that he gave those who found the tomb a
great deal of monei for the dress gold ornament and emerald necklac
as noth so perfect had been found befor and the cloth is all work
with gold thread my father told me too that he did not wish the
thing to be sold
thi wa the end of the write
have read it i examin the dress it wa of a sort that i had never
seen befor though expert to whom i have shown it sai that it is
certainli south american of a veri earli date and like the ornament
probabl preinca peruvian it is full of rich colour such as i have
seen in old indian shawl which give a gener effect of crimson thi
crimson robe clearli wa worn over a skirt of linen that had a purpl
border in the box that i have spoken of were the ornament all of
plain dull gold a waistband a circlet of gold for the head from which
rose the crescent of the young moon and a necklac of emerald uncut
stone now much flaw for what reason i do not know but polish and
set rather roughli in red gold also there were two ring round on
of these a bit of paper wa wrap upon which wa written in anoth
hand probabl that of the father of the writer of the memorandum
taken from the first finger of the right hand of a ladi mummi which i
am sorri in our circumst it wa quit imposs to carri awai
thi ring is a broad band of gold with a flat bezel upon which someth
wa onc engrav that ow to long and hard wear now cannot be
distinguish in short it appear to be a signet of old european make
but of what ag and from what countri it is imposs to determin
the other ring wa in a small leatheri pouch elabor embroid
in gold thread or veri thin wire which i suppos wa part of the ladi
costum it is like a veri massiv wed ring but six or eight time
as thick and engrav all over with an emboss convent design of
what look like star with rai round them or possibl petal flower
lastli there wa the swordhilt of which present
such were the trinket if so thei mai be call thei ar of littl
valu intrins except for their weight in gold becaus as i have
said the emerald ar flaw as though thei have been through a fire or
some other unknown caus moreov there is about them noth of the
grace and charm of ancient egyptian jewelleri evid thei belong
to a ruder ag and civil yet thei had and still have to my
imagin a certain digniti of their own
alsoher i becam infect with the spirit of the peculiar
pottswithout doubt these thing were rich in human associ who
had worn that dress of crimson with the cross work on it in gold
wire thei cannot have been christian cross and the purplebord
skirt underneath and the emerald necklac and the golden circlet from
which rose the crescent of the young moon appar a mummi in a tomb
the mummi of some longdead ladi of a strang and alien race wa she
such a on as that old lunat pott had dream he saw stand befor
him in the filthi cumber upperchamb of a ruinou hous in an
england market town i wonder on with great ey like to those of a
doe and a regal bear
no that wa nonsens pott had live with shadow until he believ in
shadow that came out of hi own imagin and into it return again
still she wa a woman of some sort and appar she had a lover or
a husband a man with a great fair beard how at thi date which must
have been remot did a goldenbeard man come to foregath with a
woman who wore such robe and ornament as these and that sword hilt
worn smooth by handl and with an amber knob whenc came it to my
mindthi wa befor expert examin confirm my viewit look
veri nors i had read the saga and i rememb a tale recov in
them of some bold norsemen who about the year eight or nine hundr
had wander to the coast of what is known now to be americai think a
certain eric wa their captain could the fairhair man in the grave
have been on of these
thu i specul befor i look at the pile of parchment so evid
prepar from sheep skin by on who had onli a veri rudimentari
knowledg of how to work such stuff not know that in those
parchment wa hid the answer to mani of my question to these i turn
last of all for we all shrink from parchment their content ar
gener so dull there wa a great bundl of them that had been lash
togeth with a kind of straw rope fine straw that remind me of that
us to make panama hat but thi had rot underneath togeth with
all the bottom part of the parchment mani sheet of them of which
onli fragment remain cover with dry mould and crumbl therefor
the rope wa easi to remov and beneath it hold the sheet in place
wa onli some stout and compar modern stringit had a red thread
in it that mark it as navi cord of an old pattern
i slip these fasten off and lift a blank piec of skin set upon
the top beneath appear the first sheet of parchment close veri
close cover with small blacklett write so faint and fade
that even if i were abl to read blacklett which i cannot of it
i could have made noth at all the thing wa hopeless doubtless
in that write lai the kei to the mysteri but it could never be
deciph by me or ani on els the ladi with the ey like a deer had
appear to old pott in vain in vain had she bidden him to hand over
thi manuscript to me
so i thought at the time not know the resourc of scienc
afterward howev i took that huge bundl to a friend a learn
friend whose busi in life it wa and is to deal with and to
deciph old manuscript
look pretti hopeless he said after stare at these still let
have a try on never know till on tri
then he went to a cupboard in hi muniment room and produc a bottl
full of some strawcolour fluid into which he dip an ordinari
paint brush thi charg brush he rub backward and forward over
the first line of the write and wait within a minut befor my
astonish ey that faint indistinguish script turn coalblack
as black as though it had been written with the best modern ink
yesterdai
it all right he said triumphantli it veget ink and thi
stuff ha the power to bring it up as it wa on the dai when it wa
us it will stai like that for a fortnight and then fade awai again
your manuscript is pretti ancient my friend time of richard ii i
should sai but i can read it easili enough look it begin i hubert
de hast write thi in the land of tavantinsuyu far from england
where i wa born whither i shall never more return be a wander
as the rune upon the sword of my ancestor thorgrimm foretold that
i should be which sword my mother gave me on the dai of the burn of
hast by the french and so on here he stop
then for heaven sake do read it i said
my dear friend he answer it look to me as though it would mean
sever month work and forgiv me for sai that i am paid a salari
for my time now ill tell you what you have to do all thi stuff
must be treat sheet by sheet and when it turn black it must
be photograph befor the write fade onc more then a skill
personsoandso or soandso ar two name that occur to memust be
emploi to deciph it again sheet by sheet it will cost you monei
but i should sai that it wa worth while where the devil is or wa
the land of tavantinsuyu
i know i answer glad to be abl to show myself superior to my
learn friend in on humbl instanc tavantinsuyu wa the nativ name
for the empir of peru befor the spanish invas but how did thi
hubert get there in the time of richard ii that is some centuri
earlier than pizarro set foot upon it shore
go and find out he answer it will amus you for quit a long
while and perhap the result mai meet the expens of decipher if
thei ar worth publish i expect thei ar not but then i have read
so mani old manuscript and found most of them so jolli dull
well that busi wa accomplish at a cost that i do not like to
record and here ar the result more or less modernis sinc often
hubert of hast express himself in a queer and archaic fashion
also sometim he us indian word as though he had talk the tongu
of these peruvian or rather the chanca varieti of it so long that he
had begun to forget hi own languag myself i have found hi stori veri
romant and interest and i hope that some other will be of the
same opinion let them judg
but oh i do wonder what wa the end of it some of which doubtless wa
record on the rot sheet though of cours there can have been no
account of the great battl in which he fell sinc quilla could not
write at all least of all in english though i suppos she surviv it
and him
the onli hint of that end is to be found in old pottss dream or vision
and what is the worth of dream and vision
book i

the sword and the ring
i hubert of hast write thi in the land of tavantinsuyu far from
england where i wa born whither i shall never more return be
a wander as the rune upon the sword of my ancestor thorgrimm
foretold that i should be which sword my mother gave me on the dai of
the burn of hast by the french i write it with a pen that i have
shape from a wing feather of the great eagl of the mountain with ink
that i have made from the juic of certain herb which i discov
and on parchment that i have split from the skin of nativ sheep with
my own hand but badli i fear though i have seen that art practis

bodi and veri strong so strong that there were few who could throw me
when i wa young
for the rest like king david i who am now so tan and weather worn
that at a littl distanc were my hair and beard hidden i might almost
be taken for on of the indian chief about me wa of a ruddi and a
pleasant counten perhap becaus of my wonder health who had
never known a dai of sick and of an easi natur that often goe
with health i will add thi for why should i notthat i wa no fool
but on of those who succe in that upon which thei set their mind
had i been a fool i should not todai be the king of a great peopl and
the husband of their queen inde i should not be aliv
but enough of myself and my appear in those year that seem as far
off as though thei had never been save in the land of dream
now i and my two serv men sailor both of them like myself and most
of the folk of hast set out upon a summer ev purpos to fish all
night and return at dawn we came to our chosen ground and cast out the
net meet with wonder fortun sinc by three in the morn the
big boat wa full of everi kind of fish never befor inde had we
made so larg a haul
look back at that great catch as here in thi far land it is my
habit to do upon everyth howev small that happen to me in my
youth befor i becam a wander and an exil i seem to see in it an
omen for ha it not alwai been my lot in life to be kiss of fortun
and to gather great store and then of a sudden to lose it all as i wa
to lose that rich multitud of fish
todai when i write thi onc more i have great wealth of pomp and
love and power of gold also more than i can count when i go forth my
armi who still look on me as half a god shout their welcom and kiss
the air after their heathen fashion my beauteou queen bow down to me
and the women of my household abas themselv into the dust the
peopl of the ancient citi of gold turn their face to the wall and the
children cover their ey with their hand that thei mai not look upon
my splendour as i pass while maiden throw flower for my feet to
tread upon my judgment hang life or death and my lightest word is as
though it were spoken from heaven these and mani other thing ar mine
the trap of power the prerog of the lordfromthesea who
brought victori to the chanca peopl and led them back to their ancient
home where thei might live safe far from the inca rage
and yet often as i sit alon in my splendour upon the roof of the
ancient hall or wander through the starlit palac garden i call to
mind that great catch of fish in the english sea and of what follow
after i call to mind also my prosper and wealth as on of the first
merchant of london town and what follow after i call to mind too
the win of blanch alei the ladi so far abov me in rank and
station and what follow after then it is that i grow afraid of what
mai follow after thi present hour of peac and love and plenti
certainli on thing will follow and that is death it mai come late
or it mai come soon but yesterdai a rumour reach me through my spi
that kari upanqui the inca of tavantinsuyu he who onc wa as my
brother but who now hate me becaus of hi superstit and becaus
i took a virgin of the sun to be my wife gather a great host to follow
on the path we trod mani year ago when the chanca fled from the inca
tyranni back to their home in the ancient citi of gold and to smite us
here that host said the rumour cannot march till next year and then
will be anoth year upon it journei still know kari i am sure
that it will march ye and arriv after which must befal the great
battl in the mountain pass wherein as of old i shall lead the
chanca armi
perchanc i am doom to fall in that battl doe not the rune upon
waveflam the sword of thorgrimm my ancestor sai of him that hold
it that
conquer conquer shall he be
and far awai shall sleep with me
well if the chanca conquer what care i if i am conquer twould be
a good death and a clean to fall by kari spear if i knew that kari
and hi host fell also as i swear that fall thei shall st hubert
help me then at least quilla and her children would live on in peac
and great sinc thei can have no other foe to fear
death what is death i sai that it is the hope of everi on of us and
most of all the exil and the wander at the best it mai be glori at
the worst it must be sleep moreov am i so happi that i should fear
to die quilla cannot read thi write and therefor i will answer
no i am a christian but she and those about her ay my own children
with them worship the moon and the host of heaven i am whiteskin
thei ar the hue of copper though it is true that my littl daughter
gudruda whom i name so after my mother is almost white there ar
secret in their heart that i shall never learn and there ar secret
in mine from which thei cannot draw the veil becaus our blood ar
differ yet god know i love them well enough and most of all that
greatest of women quilla
oh the truth is that here on earth there is no happi for man
it is becaus of thi rumour of the come of kari with hi host that i
set myself to thi task that i have long had in my mind to write down
someth of my histori both in england and in thi land which at ani
rate for hundr of year mine is the first white foot to press it
seem a foolish thing to do sinc when i have written who will read and
what will chanc to that which i have written i shall leav order that
it be place beneath my feet in the tomb but who will ever find that
tomb again still i write becaus someth in my heart urg me to the
task
i return to the faroff dai our boat be full with merri heart we
set sail befor a faint wind for hast beach as yet there wa littl
light and much fog still the landward breez wa enough to draw us
forward then of a sudden we heard sound as of men talk upon ship
and the clank of spar and block present came a puff of air lift
the fog for a littl and we saw that we were in the midst of a
great fleet a french fleet for the lili of franc flew at their
masthead saw too that their prow were set for hast though
for the while thei were becalm sinc the wind that wa enough for our
light largesail fishingboat could not stir their bulk moreov
thei saw us for the menatarm on the nearest ship shout threat and
curs at us and follow the shout with arrow that almost hit us
then the fog close down again and in it we slip through the french
fleet
it mai have been the best part of an hour later that we reach
hast befor the boat wa made fast to the jetti i sprang to it
shout
stir stir the french ar upon you to arm we have slip through a
whole fleet of them in the mist
instantli the sleepi quai seem to awaken from the neighbour fish
market from everywher sailormen and other came run follow by
children with gape mouth while from the door of hous far awai
shot women with scare face like ferret rabbit from their burrow
in a minut the crowd had surround me all ask question at onc in
such a fashion that i could onli answer them with my cry of
stir the french ar upon you to arm i sai to arm
present through the throng advanc an old whitebeard man who wore
a badg of offic cry as he came make wai for the bailiff
the crowd obei open a path and soon we were face to face
what is it hubert of hast he ask is there fire that you
shout so loudli
ay worship i answer fire and murder and all the gift that the
french have for england the fleet of franc is beat up for hast
fifti sail of them or more we crept through them in the fog for the
wind which would scarc move them serv our turn and beyond an arrow or
two thei took no note of a fishingboat
whenc come thei ask the bailiff bewild
i know not but those in anoth boat we pass in the midst shout
that these french were ravag the coast and head for hast
to put it to fire and sword then that boat vanish awai i know not
where and that is all i have to tell save that the french will be here
within an hour
without stai to ask more question the bailiff turn and ran
toward the town and present the alarm bell rang out from the tower
of all saint and st clement while crier summon all men to the
marketplac meanwhil i not without a sad look at my boat and the
rich catch within made my wai into the town follow by my two men
present i reach an ancient timber hous long low and rambl
with a yard by it side full of barrel anchor and other marin
store such as rope that had to do with the trade i carri on at thi
place
i hubert with a mind full of fear though not for myself and a
stir of the blood such as wa natur to my ag at the approach
of my first tast of battl ran fast up to that hous which i have
describ and paus for a moment by the big elm tree that grew in
front of the door of which the lower bough were sawn off becaus thei
shut out the light from the window i rememb that elm tree veri
well first becaus when i wa a child starl nest in a hole in the
trunk and i rear on in a wicker cage and made a talk bird of it
which i kept for sever year it wa so tame that it us to go about
sit on my shoulder till at last outsid the town a cat frighten
it thenc and befor i could recaptur it it wa taken by a hawk
which hawk i shot afterward with an arrow out of reveng
also thi elm is impress upon me by the fact that on that morn when
i halt by it i note how green and full of leaf it wa next morn
after the fire i saw it again all char and blacken with it
beauti foliag wither by the heat thi contrast remain upon my
memori and whenev i see ani great chang of fortun from prosper
to ruin or from life to death alwai i bethink me of that elm for
it is by littl thing which we ourselv have seen and not by those
written of or told by other that we measur and compar event
the reason that i ran so hard and then paus by the elm wa becaus
my widow mother live in that hous know that the french meant
mischief for a good reason becaus on of their arrow or perhap a
quarrel from a crossbow whistl just past my head out there upon the
sea my first thought wa to get her awai to some place of safeti no
easi task see that she wa infirm with ag my second that which
caus me to paus by the tree wa how i should break the new to her
in such a fashion that she would not be overfrighten have thought
thi over i went on into the hous
the door open into the sittingroom that had a low roof of plaster and
big oak beam there i found my mother kneel by the tabl upon which
food wa set for breakfast fri her cold meat and a jug of al
she wa sai her prayer after her custom be veri religi
though in a new fashion sinc she wa a follow of a preacher call
wycliff who troubl the church in those dai she seem to have gone
to sleep at her prayer and i watch her for a moment hesit to
waken her my mother as even then i note wa a veri handsom woman
though old for i wa born when she had been marri twenti year or
more with white hair and wellcut featur that show the good blood
of which she came for she wa better bred than my father and quarrel
with her kin to marri him
at the sound of my footstep she woke up and saw me
strang she said i slept at my prayer who did so littl last
night as ha becom a habit with me when you ar out afish for
which god forgiv me and dream that there wa some troubl forward
scold me not hubert for when the sea ha taken the father and two
son it is scarc wonder that i should be fear for the last of
my blood help me to rise hubert for thi water seem to gather in my
limb and make them heavi on dai the leech sai it will get to the
heart and then all will be over
i obei first kiss her on the brow and when she wa seat in her
arm chair by the tabl i said
you dream too well mother there is troubl hark st clement
bell ar talk of it the french come to visit hast i know for i
sail through their fleet just after dawn
is it so she ask quietli i fear wors i fear lest the dream
meant that you had gone to join your brother in the deep well the
french ar not here yet as thank god you ar so eat and drink for we
of england fight best on full belli

and al and as i swallow them we heard the sound of folk shout and
run

a frenchman or two to hell with that big bow of your she said
inquiringli

fear mai be burnt there is a certain cave up yonder by the minn rock

chapter ii
the ladi blanch
so i went with a sore heart for i rememb that when my father and
brother were drown although i wa then but a littl on my mother
had foreseen it and i fear much lest it might be thu in her own case
also i love my mother she wa a stern woman it wa true with littl
soft about her which i think came with her blood but she had a
high heart and oh her last word were nobl yet through it all i
wa pleas as ani young man would have been with the gift of the
wonder sword which onc had been that of thorgrimm the searov
whose blood ran in my bodi against which it lai and i hope that
thi dai i might have chanc to us it worthili as thorgrimm did in
forgotten battl have imagin i wonder also whether the sword
knew that after it long sleep it had come forth again to drink the
blood of foe
also i wa pleas with anoth thing name that my mother had
told me that i should live my life and not die that dai by the hand
of frenchmen and that in my life i should find love of which to tell
truth alreadi i knew a littl of a humbl sort for i wa a come
youth and women did not run awai from me or if thei did soon thei
stop i want to live my life i want to see great adventur and
to win great love the onli part of the busi which wa not to my
tast wa that command of my mother that i should go to london to sit
in a goldsmith shop still i had heard that there wa much to be seen
in london and at least it would be differ from hast
the street outsid our door wa crowd with folk some of the men
make their wai to the marketplac about whom hung women and children
weep other old peopl wive and girl and littl on flee
from the town i found the two sailormen who had been with me on the
boat wait for me thei were brawni fellow name jack griev and
william bull who had been in our servic sinc my childhood good
fishermen and fighter both inde on of them william bull had
serv in the french war
we knew that you were come master so we bide here for you said
william who have onc been an archer wa arm with a bow and a short
sword wherea jack had onli an ax also a knife such as we us on the
smack for clean fish
i nod and we went on to the marketplac and join the throng of
men a vast number of them who were gather there to defend hast
and their home nor were we too soon for the french ship were alreadi
beach within a few yard of the shore or on it their draught be
but small while the sailor and menatarm were push off in small
boat or wade to the strand
there wa great confus in the marketplac for as is common in
england no prepar had been made against attack though such wa
alwai to be fear
the bailiff ran about shout order as did other but proper
offic were lack so that in the end men act as the fanci took
them some went down toward the beach and shot with arrow at the
frenchmen other took refug in hous other stood irresolut
wait know not which wai to turn i and my two men were with those
who went on to the beach where i loos some arrow from my big black
bow and saw a man fall befor on of them
but we could do littl or noth for these frenchmen were train
soldier under proper command thei form themselv into compani
and advanc and we were driven back i stop as long as i dare
and draw the sword waveflam fought with a frenchman who wa in
advanc of the other what is more make a great blow at hi head
which i miss i struck him on the arm and cut it off for i saw it
fall to the ground then other rush up at me and i fled to save my
life
somehow i found myself be press up the steep castl hill with a
number of hast folk follow by the french we reach the castl
and got into it but the old portculli would not close and in sundri
place the wall were broken down here we found a number of women who
had climb for refug think that the place would be safe among
these wa a beauti and highborn maiden whom i knew by sight her
father wa sir robert alei who i believ wa then the warden of the
castl of pevensei and she wa name the ladi blanch onc inde i
had spoken with her on an occas too long to tell then her larg blue
ey which she knew well how to us had left me with a swim head
for she wa veri fair and veri sweet and graciou with a most soft
voic and quit unlik ani other woman i had ever seen nor did she
seem at all proud soon her father an old knight who had no name for
gentl in the countrysid but wa said to be a great lover of gold
had come up and swept her awai ask her what she did talk with a
common fish churl thi had happen some month befor
well there i found her in the castl alon it seem and know me
again which i thought strang she ran to me prai me to protect
her more she began to tell me some long tale to which i had not time
to listen of how she had come to hast with her father sir robert
and a young lord name deleroi who i understood wa some kinsman of
her and slept there how too she had been separ from them in the
throng when thei were attempt to return to pevensei which her father
must go to guard becaus her hors wa frighten and ran awai and
of how final men took her by the arm and brought her to thi castl
sai that it wa the safest place
then here you must bide ladi blanch i answer cut her short
cling to me and i will save you if i can even if it cost me my life
certainli she did cling to me for all the rest of that terribl dai as
will be seen
from thi height we saw hast begin to burn for the frenchmen
had fire the town in sundri place and be built of wood it burnt
furious also we saw and heard horribl scene and sound of rapin
such as chanc in thi christian world of our where a savag foe find
peac folk of anoth race at hi merci in the hous peopl were
burnt in the street thei were be murder or wors ye even
children were murder for afterward i saw the bodi of some of them
awhil later through the wreath of smoke we perceiv compani of the
french advanc to attack the castl there mai have been three hundr
of them in all and we did not count more than fifti men some of
us illarm togeth with a mob of ag peopl and mani women and
children what had becom of the other men i do not know but order
had been shout from all quarter and some had gone thi wai and some
that some too i think had fled lack leader
the french have climb the hill began to attack our illfenc
gatewai bring up beam of timber to forc them in those of us who
had bow shot some of them though their armour be good for the
most part the arrow glanc but few had bow moreov whenev we
show ourselv thei pour such a rain of quarrel and other shaft
upon us that we could not face it lack mail as we did and a number
of us were kill or wound at last thei forc the easternmost gate
which wa the weakest and got in there and over a place in the wall
were it wa broken we fought them as well as we could myself i cut
down two with the sword waveflam hew right through the helm of
on for the steel of that sword wa good here too jack griev wa
kill by my side by a pike thrust and di call to me to fight on
for old england and hast town after which he said someth about
beer and breath hi last
the end of it wa that those who were left were driven out of the castl
togeth with the women and children the murder french kill everi
man who fell wound where he lai and try to make prison ani women
thei thought young and fair enough especi did thei seek to captur
the ladi blanch becaus thei saw that she wa beauti and of high
station but by good fortun more than aught els i save her from thi
fate
as it chanc we were among the last to leav the castl whenc to
tell the truth i wa loath to go for by now my blood wa up and with
a few other fought till i wa driven out i prai the ladi blanch to
run forward with the other women but she would not answer that she
trust no on els but would stai to die with me as though that would
help either of us
thu it came about that a tall french knight who had set hi ey on
her outclimb hi fellow upon the slope of the hill for thei were
weari and gather to reform and catch her round the middl
strove to drag her awai i fell on him and we fought he had fine armour
and a shield while i had none but i held the long sword while he onli
wield a battleax i knew that if he could get in a blow with that
battleax i wa sped sinc the bull hide of my jerkin would never
stand against it therefor it wa my busi to keep out of hi reach
thi be young and activ for the most part i made shift to do
especi as he could not move veri quickli in hi mail the end of it
wa that i cut him on the arm through a joint in hi har whereon he
rush at me swear french oath
i leapt on on side and as he pass smote with all my strength the
blow fell between neck and shoulder from behind as it were and such
wa the temper of that sword name waveflam that it shore through hi
mail deep into the flesh beneath to the backbon as i believ at least
he went down in a heapi rememb the rattl of hi armour as he fell
and there lai still then we fled on down the steep path i hold the
bloodi sword with on hand and ladi blanch with the other while she
thank me with her ey
at length we were in the town again run up my own street on either
side of us the hous burn and behind us came anoth bodi of the
french the reek got into our ey and we stumbl over dead or faint
peopl
look to the left i caught sight of the elm tree of which i have
spoken that grew in front of our door and saw that the hous behind
it wa burn ye and i saw more for at the attic window which wa
open the flame make an arch round her sat my mother moreov she
wa sing for i heard her voic and the wild word she sang though
thi wa a strang thing for a woman to do in the hour of such a death
further she saw and knew me for she wave her hand to me then
point toward the sea why i did not guess at the time i stop
purpos to try to rescu her though the front of the hous wa
flame and the attempt must have end in my death but at that moment
the roof fell in caus the fire to spout upward and outward thi
wa the last that i saw of my mother though afterward we found her
bodi and gave it burial with those of mani other victim
there wa no time to stai for the conquer french were pour up the
street behind us shoot as thei came and murder ani laggard whom
thei could catch on we went up the steep slope of the minn rock i
would have fled on into the open countri but the ladi blanch had no
strength left twice she sank to the ground stricken with terror and
weari and each time prai me not to leav her nor inde did i
wish to do so the end of it wa that william bull and i between us
half carri her with much toil to the cave of which i had spoken to my
mother the task wa heavi and slow sinc alwai we must scrambl over
sheer ground what is more a parti of the french see our plight
follow us perhap some of them guess who the ladi wa for there
were mani spi in hast who might have told them and desir to
captur and hold her to ransom
at the least thei came on after us and a few other women all of them
who had join our compani be unabl to travel further or trust
to william bull and myself to protect them
we reach the cave and thrust the women along it william and i
stood in the mouth and wait he had no bow and all my arrow were gone
save three but of these i who wa note for my archeri determin
to make the best us i could so i drew them out and have strung
the bow sat down to get my breath on came the french shout and
jabber at us to the effect that thei would cut our throat and carri
off la bell dame to be their sport
she shall be mine yell a big fellow with a flatten nose and a
wide mouth who wa ahead of the other and not more than fifti yard
awai
i rose and prai my patron good st hubert after whom i wa name
becaus i first saw light upon hi dai the 23rd of novemb to give
me skill i drew the great bow to my ear aim and loos nor did
st hubert a lover of fine shoot fail me in my need for that arrow
rush out and found it home in the big mouth of the frenchman through
which it pass pin hi foul tongu to hi neck bone
down he went and cheer by the sight i refit and loos at the
next him too the arrow caught so that he fell almost on the other
i set the third and last arrow on the string and wait a space behind
these two wa a squat broad man a knight i suppos for he wore
armour and had a shield with a cock paint on it thi man frighten
by the fate of hi companion yet not mind to give up the ventur
for those in rear of him urg him on bent himself almost doubl and
hold the shield over hi helm which wa close so as to protect hi
head and bodi came on at a good pace
i wait till he wa within fiveandtwenti yard or so hope that
the rough of the ground would caus him to stumbl and the shield to
shift so that i could get a chanc at him behind it but i did not so
at last again prai to st hubert i drew the big bow till the string
touch my ear and let drive the shaft point with temper steel
struck the shield full in the centr and by heaven pierc it ay
and the mail behind ay and the flesh it cover so that he too got
hi death
a great shot master said william that no other bow in hast
could have sped
not so ill i answer but it is my last now we must fight as we
can with sword and ax until we be sped
william nod and the women in the cave began to wail while i unstrung
my bow and set it in it case from habit i think see that i never
hope to look upon it again
just then from the french ship in the harbour there came a great
blare of trumpet give some alarm and the frenchmen of a sudden
ceas from their attack turn and ran toward the shore i step
out of the cave with william and look there on the sea draw near
from the east befor a good wind i saw ship and saw too that from
their mast flew the pennon of england for the golden leopard gleam
in the sun
it is our fleet william i said come to talk with these french
then i would that it had come sooner answer william still better
now than not at all
thu were we save through hamo de offyngton the abbot of battl
abbei or so i wa told afterward who collect a forc by land and
sea and drove off the french after thei had ravag the isl of wight
attack winchelsea and burn the greater part of hast so it
came about that in the end these pirat took littl benefit by their
wicked sinc thei lost sundri ship with all on board and other
left in such hast that their peopl remain on shore where thei were
slain by the mob that gather as soon as it wa seen that thei were
desert help by a compani of the abbot men who had march from
battl but with all thi i had noth to do who now that the fight
wa over felt weak as a child and could think of littl save that i had
seen my mother burn
present howev that happen which woke me from my grief and caus
my blood which had grown sluggish to run again for when she knew that
she wa safe the ladi blanch came out of the cave and address me as i
stood there lean against the rock with the red sword waveflam in my
hand as i had drawn it to make readi for the last fight to the death
all sort of sweet name she call mea hero her deliver and i
know not what besid
in the end as i made no answer be daze also hurt by an ax blow
on the breast which i had not felt befor dealt by that frenchman whom
i slew near the castl she did more throw her arm about me she
kiss me thrice on either cheek and on the lip doubtless becaus she
wa overwrought and in her thank forgot her maidenli reserv
though as william bull said afterward thi forget did not caus
her to kiss him who had also help her up the hill
those kiss were like wine to me for it is strang how if we love
her by the decre of natur the touch of a beauti woman lip felt
for the first time affect us in our youth whatev els we forget
that we alwai rememb howev fals those lip afterward be prove
for then the wax is soft and the die sink deep so deep that no
afterheat can melt it stamp and no fret wear it out while we live
beneath the sun
now my young blood be awaken i wa mind to return those kiss
and began to do so with a jew interest when i heard a rough voic
swear mani strang oath and heard also the other women who had
shelter with us in the cave begin to titter for the moment forget
all their privat woe as those of their sex will do when there is
kiss in the wind
god blood said the rough voic who is thi that handl my
daughter as though thei had been but an hour wed take those lip of
your from her fellow or ill cut them from your chop
i look round astonish to see sir robert alei mount on a grei
hors and follow by a compani of menatarm who appear to be under
the command of a wellfavour darkei young captain with long hair
and dress more wondrous than ani man i had ever seen befor had he
put on joseph coat over hi mail he could not have worn more colour
and i note that the toe of hi shoe curl up so high that i wonder
howev he work them through hi stirrup and what would happen to
him if by chanc he were unhors
be taken aback i made no answer but william bull who if a rough
fellow had a tongu in hi head and a readi wit spoke up for me
if you want to know he said in hi sussex drawl ill tell you who
he is sir robert alei he is my worship master hubert of hast
shipown household and trader of thi town or at least he wa
these thing but now it seem that hi ship and hous ar burnt and
hi mother with them also that there will be no trade in hast for
mani a dai
mayhap answer sir robert ad other oath but why doe he buss
my daughter
perchanc becaus he must give as good as he got which is a law among
honest merchant nobl sir robert or perchanc becaus he ha a better
right to buss her than ani man aliv see that but for him by now
she would be but stink clai or a frenchman leman
here the fine young captain cut in sai
whatev els thi worship trader mai need he doe not lack a
trumpet
that is so my lord deleroi repli william unmov for when i
find a good song i like to sing it go now and look at those three men
who lie yonder on the slope and see whether the arrow in them bear my
master mark go also and look upon the castl hill and find a knight
with hi head wellnigh hewn from hi shoulder and see whether yonder
sword fit into the cut ay and at other that i could tell you of
slain everi on of them to save thi fair ladi ay go you whose
garment ar so fine and unstain and then come back and talk of
trumpet
pish said my lord deleroi with a shrug of hi shoulder a ladi who
is overwrought and hang to some common fellow like on who kiss the
feet of a wooden saint that she think ha save her from calam
at these word i who had been listen like a man in a dream awok
as it were for thei stung me moreov i had heard that thi fine
deleroi wa on of those who ow hi place and rank to the king
favour as he did hi high name be it wa report by birth but a
princ bastard sprung from some rel of sir robert whom therefor
he call cousin
sir i said you know best whether i am more common than you ar
let that be at least i hold in my hand the sword of on who begat my
forefath hundr of year ago a certain thorgrimm who wa great in
hi time now i have had my fill of fight todai and you doubtless
through no fault of your own have had none you also ar clad in mail
and i a common fellow have none deign then to descend from that hors
and take a turn with me though i be tire and thu prove my common
upon my bodi of your nobil do thi see that after all we ar of
on flesh
now stung in hi turn he made as though he would do what i prai
when for the first time after glanc at her father who sat
stillpuzzl it would seemth ladi blanch spoke
be not mad cousin she said i tell you that thi gentleman ha
save my life and honour twice at least todai is it wonder then
if i thank him in the best fashion that a woman can and thu brought
your insult on him
he hesit though on of hi curledup shoe wa out of the stirrup
when suddenli sir robert broke in in hi big voic sai
god truth cousin i think that you will do well to leav thi young
cock alon sinc i like not the look of that red spur of hi and he
glanc at the sword waveflam though he be weari he mai have a kick
or two in him yet
then he turn to me and ad
sir you have fought well mani a man ha earn knighthood for less
and if a fair maid thank you in her own fashion you ar not to blame
i her father also thank you and wish you all good fortun till we meet
again farewel daughter make shift to share thi hors with me and
let us awai out of thi stricken town to pevensei where perchanc it
will pleas those french to call tomorrow
a minut later thei were gone and i note with a pang that as thei went
the ladi blanch have wave her goodby to me talk fast to her
cousin deleroi and that he held her hand to steadi her upon her father
hors
chapter iii
hubert come to london
when the ladi blanch wa out of sight follow by the women who had
shelter with us in the cave william and i went to a stream we knew of
not far awai and drank our fill then we walk to the three whom i had
shot with my big bow hope to regain the arrow for i had none left
thi howev could not be done though all the men were dead for on
of the shaft the last wa broken and the other two were so fix in
flesh and bone that onli a surgeon saw would loos them
so we left them where thei were and befor the men were buri mani
came to marvel at the sight think it a wonder thing that i should
have kill these three with three arrow and that ani bow which arm
might bend could have driven the last of them through an iron shield and
a breastplat behind it
thi armour i should tell william took for himself sinc it wa of
hi size also on the morrow return to the castl hill i strip
the knight whom i had slain with the sword waveflam of hi splendid
milan mail whereof the plastron or breastplat wa inlaid with
gold have over it a camail of chain to cover the joint through
which my good sword had shorn into hi neck the cogniz on hi
shield strang enough wa three barb arrow but what wa the name
of the knight who bore it i never learn thi mail which must have
cost a great sum the bailiff of hast grant me to keep sinc i
had slain it wearer and born myself well in the fight moreov i
took the three arrow for my own cogniz though in truth i had no
right to ani be in those dai but a trader littl did i know then
how well thi mail wa to serv me in the after year
by now night wa come on and as we could see from the cave mouth
that the part of hast which li toward the villag of st leonard
seem to have escap the fire thitherward we went by the beach to
avoid the heat and fall timber in the burn town on our wai we
met other and from them heard all that had befallen it would seem that
the french loss in life wa heavier than our own sinc mani of them
were cut off when thei tri to fly to their ship and some of these
could not be float from the beach or were ram and sunk with all
aboard by the english vessel but the damag done to hast wa as
much as could scarc be made good in a gener for the most of it
wa burnt or burn also mani like my own mother had perish in
the fire be sick or ag or in childb or for thi reason and that
forgotten and unabl to move inde on the beach were hundr of
folk in despair nor wa it onli the women and children who wept that
even
for my part with william i went beyond the burn to the hous of a
certain old priest who wa my confessor and the friend of my father
befor me and there we found food and slept he return thank to god
for my escap and offer me consol for the loss of my mother and
good
i rest but ill that night as those do who ar overweari moreov
thi had been my first tast of battl and again and again i saw those
men fall befor my sword and arrow veri proud wa i to have slain
them wick ravish as thei were and veri glad that from my boyhood
i had practis myself with sword and bow till i could fenc with ani
and wa perhap the most skill marksman in hast have won the
silver arrow at the butt at the last meet and from archer of all
ag yet the sight of their death haunt me who rememb how well
their fate might have been my own had thei got in the first shot or
blow
where had thei gone to i wonder to the priest heaven or hell were
thei now tell their sin to some hardfac angel while he check
the count from hi book remind them of mani that thei had forgotten
or were thei fast asleep for ever and ever as a shrewd thinker whom i
knew had told me secretli he wa sure would be the fate of all of us
whatev the priest might teach and believ and where wa my mother
whom i had love and who love me well although outwardli she wa so
stern a woman my mother whom i had seen burn aliv sing as she
burn oh it wa a vile world and it seem strang that god should
caus men and women to be born that thei might come to such cruel end
yet who were we to question hi decre of which we knew neither the
begin nor the finish
anywai i wa glad i wa not dead for now that all wa over i trembl
and felt afraid which i had never done dure the fight even when
my hour seem veri near
lastli there wa thi highborn ladi blanch alei with whom fortun
had thrown me so strang that dai those blue ey of her had pierc
my heart like dart and do what i would i might not rid my mind of the
thought of her or my ear of the sound of her soft voic while her
kiss seem still to burn upon my lip it wrung me to think that
perhap i should never see her again or that if i did i might not speak
with her be so far beneath her in condit and have alreadi
earn the wrath of her father and as i guess the jealousi of that
scent cousin of her whom thei said the king love like a brother
what had my mother told me to leav thi place and go to london there
to find my uncl john grimmer goldsmith and merchant who wa my
godfath and to ask him to take me into hi busi i rememb
thi uncl of mine for some seven or eight year befor when i wa a
grow lad becaus there wa a plagu in london he had come down to
hast to visit us he onli stai a week howev becaus he said
that the sea air ti up hi stomach and that he would rather risk
the plagu with a good stomach than leav it behind him with a bad
onethough i think it wa hi busi he thought of not hi stomach
he wa a strang old man not unlik my mother but with a nose more
hook small dark ey and a bald head on which he set a cap of
velvet even in the heat of summer he wa alwai cold and wore a frai
fur robe complain much if he came into a draught of air inde he
look like a jew though a good christian enough and laugh about
it becaus he said that thi appear of hi serv him well in hi
trade sinc jew were alwai fear and it wa held to be imposs
to overreach them
for the rest i onli recal that he examin me as to my book learn
which did not satisfi him and went about valu all our good and
fishingboat show my mother how we were be cheat and might
earn more than we did when he depart he gave me a gold piec and said
that life wa noth but vaniti and that i must prai for hi soul when
he wa dead as he wa sure it would need such help also that i ought
to put the gold piec out to interest thi i did by bui with it a
certain fierc mastiff dog i covet that had been brought on a ship
from norwai which dog bit some great man in our town who haul my
mother befor the bailiff about it and caus the poor beast to be
kill to my great wrath
now that i came to think of it i had like my uncl john well enough
although he wa so differ from other why should i not go to him
becaus i did not wish to sit in a shop in london i who love the sea
and the open air also becaus i fear he might ask me what i had done
with that gold piec and make a mock of me about the dog yet my mother
had bidden me go and it wa her last command to me her dy word
which it would be unlucki to disobei moreov our boat and hous
were burnt and i must work hard and long befor these could be replac
lastli in london i should see no more of the ladi blanch alei and
there could learn to forget the light in her blue ey so i determin
that i would go and at last fell asleep
next morn i made my confess to the old priest that amongst other
matter he might shrive me of the blood which i had shed though thi
he said need no forgiv from god or man be as i think a
stout englishman at heart also i took counsel with him as to what i
should do and he told me it wa my duti to obei my mother wish
sinc such last word were often inspir from on high and declar the
will of heaven further he point out that i should do well to avoid
the ladi blanch alei who wa on far abov me in degre the follow
of whom might bring me to troubl or even to death moreov that i
might mend my broken fortun through the help of my uncl a veri rich
man as he had heard to whom he would write a letter about me
thu thi matter wa settl
still some dai went by befor i left hast sinc first i must wait
until the ash of our hous were cool enough to search in them for my
mother bodi those who found her at length said that she wa not so
much burn as might have been expect but as to thi i am uncertain
sinc i could not bring myself to look upon her who desir to rememb
her as she had been in life she wa buri by the side of my father
who wa drown in the churchyard of st clement and when all had
gone awai i wept a littl on her grave
the rest of that dai i spent make readi for my journei as it chanc
when the hous wa burnt the outbuild which lai on the farther side
of the yard behind escap the fire and in the stabl were two good
hors on a grei ridinggeld and the other a mare that us to drag
the net to the quai and bring back the fish which hors although
frighten and alarm were unharm also there wa a quantiti of
store net salt dri fish in barrel and i know not what besid
the hors i kept but all the rest of the gear togeth with the
premis the ground on which the hous had stood and the other
properti i made over to william my man who promis me to pai me their
valu when he could earn it in better time
next morn i rode awai for london upon the grei hors load the
armour of the knight i had kill and such other possess as remain
to me upon the mare which i led with a rope save william there wa none
to sai me goodby for the miseri in hast wa so great that all
were concern with their own affair or in mourn their dead i
wa not sorri that it fell out thu sinc i wa so full of sad at
leav the place where i wa born and had live all my life that i
think i should have shed tear if ani who had been my friend had spoken
kind word to me which would have been unmanli never had i felt
so lone as when from the high ground i gaze back to the ruin of
hast over which still hung a thin pall of smoke my courag seem
to fail me altogeth i look forward to the futur with fear
believ that i had been born unlucki that it held no good for me
who probabl should end my dai as a common soldier or a fisherman or
mayhap in prison or on the gallow from childhood i had suffer these
fit of gloom but as yet thi wa the blackest of them that i had
known
at length the sun that had been hidden shone out and with it come my
temper chang i rememb that i who might so easili have been dead
wa sound young and healthi that i had sword bow and armour of the
best also twenti or more of gold piec for i had not count them in
the bag which my mother gave me with waveflam further i hope that
my uncl would befriend me and if he did not there were plenti of
captain engag in the war who might be glad of a squir on who
could shoot against ani man and handl a sword as well as most
so put up a prayer to st hubert after my simpl fashion i push
on blith to the crest of a long rise and there came face to face with
a gai compani who hawk on wrist and hound at heel were i guess
on their wai to hunt in the pevensei marsh while thei were still a
littl wai off i knew these to be no other than sir robert alei hi
daughter blanch and the king favourit young lord deleroi with
their servant and wa mind to turn asid to avoid them then i
rememb that i had as much right to the king highwai as thei and
my pride aid me determin to ride on take no note of them unless
first thei took note of me also thei knew me for my ear be veri
sharp i heard sir robert sai in hi big voic
here come that young fisherman again pass him in silenc daughter
heard too lord deleroi drawl it it seem that he ha been gather
gear from the slain and like a good chapman bear it awai for secret
sale
onli the ladi blanch answer neither the on nor the other but rode
forward with her ey fix befor her pretend to talk to the hawk
upon her wrist and now that she wa rest and at eas look even
more beauti than she had done on the dai of the burn
so we met and pass i glanc at them idli and guid my hors to
the side of the road when there were perhap ten yard between us i
heard ladi blanch cry
oh my hawk i look round to see that the falcon on her wrist had in
some wai loos itself or been loos and be hood had fallen to
the ground where on of the dog wa try to catch and kill it now
there wa great confus the ey of all be fix upon the hawk and
the dog in the midst of which the ladi blanch veri quietli turn her
head and lift her hand as though to see how the hawk had fallen from
it with a swift movement laid her finger against her lip and threw a
kiss to me
as swiftli i bow back and went on my wai with a beat heart for a
few moment i wa fill with joi sinc i could not mistak the mean
of thi signal kiss then came sorrow like an april cloud sinc my
wound which wa in the wai of heal wa all reopen i had begun to
forget the ladi blanch or rather by an effort of the will to thrust
her from my thought as my confessor had bidden me but now on the wing
of that blown kiss thither she had flown back again not to be fright
out for mani a dai
that night i slept at an inn at tonbridg a comfort place where the
host stare at the gold piec from the bag which i tender in payment
and at first would not take what wa due to him out of it becaus it
bore the head of some ancient king howev in the end a merchant of
tonbridg who came in for hi morn al show him that it wa good
so that troubl pass
about two in the afternoon i came to southwark a town that to me seem
as big as hast befor it wa burn where wa a fine inn call the
tabard at which i stop to bait my hors and to take a bite and drink
of al then i rode on over the great thame where float a multitud
of ship and boat cross it by london bridg a work so wonder
that i marvel that it could be made by the hand of man and so broad
that it had shop on either side of the roadwai in which were sold all
sort of merchandis thenc i inquir my wai to cheapsid and came
there at last thrust a path through a roar multitud of peopl
or so it seem to me who never befor had seen so mani men and women
gather togeth all go on their wai and it would appear ignor
of each other
here i found a long and crowd thoroughfar with gabl hous on
either side in which all kind of trade were carri on down thi i
wander be curs at more than onc becaus my pack mare grow
frighten drag awai from me and cross the path of cart which had
to stop till i could pull her free after the third of these tangl i
halt by the side of the footwai behind a wain with barrel on it and
look about me bewild
to my left wa a hous somewhat set back from the gener line that
had a littl patch of garden ground in front of it in which grew some
untend and thriftlesslook shrub thi hous seem to be a place
of busi becaus from an iron fasten to the front of it hung a
board on which wa paint an open boat high at the prow and stern
with a tall beak fashion to the like of a dragon head and round
shield all down the rail
while i wa stare at thi sign and wonder emptili what kind of a
boat it wa and of what nation were the folk who had sail in her a
man came down the garden path and lean upon the gate stare in turn
at me he wa old and strangelook be clad in a rusti gown with
a hood to it that wa pull over hi head so that i could onli see a
white peak beard and a pair of brilliant black ey which seem to
pierc me as a shoemak awl pierc leather
what do you young man he ask in a high thin voic cumber my
gate with those nag of your would you sell that mail you have on the
packhors if so i do not deal in such stuff though it seem good of
it kind so get on with it elsewher
nai sir i answer i have naught to sell who in thi hive of
trader seek on bee and cannot find him
hive of trader truli the great merchant of the cheap would be
honour have thei stung you then alreadi young bumpkin from the
countrysid for such i write you down but what bee do you seek stai
now let me guess is it a certain old knave name john grimmer who
trade in gold and jewel and other preciou thing and who if he had
hi desert should be jail
ay ay that the man i said
sure he also will be honour exclaim the old fellow with a
cackl he a friend of mine and i will tell him the jest
if you would tell me where to find him it would be more season
all in good time but first young sir where did you get that fine
armour if you stole it it should be better hid
stole it i began in wrath am i a london chapman
i think not though you mai be befor all is done for who know what
vile trick fortun will plai us well if you did not steal it mayhap
you slew the wearer and ar a murder for i see black blood on the
steel
murder i gasp
ay just as you sai john grimmer is a knave but if not then
perchanc you slew the french knight who wore it on hast hill er
you loos the three arrow at the mouth of the cave near minn rock
now i gape at him
shut your mouth young man lest those teeth of your should fall
out you wonder how i know well my friend john grimmer the goldsmith
knave ha a magic crystal which he purchas from on who brought it
from the east and i saw it in that crystal
as he spoke as though by chanc he push back the hood that cover
hi head reveal a wrinkl old face with a mock mouth which
droop at on corner a mouth that i knew again although mani year
had pass sinc i look upon it as a boi
you ar john grimmer i mutter
ye hubert of hast i am that knave himself and now tell me what
did you do with the gold piec i gave you some twelv summer gone
then i wa mind to lie for i fear thi old man but think better
of it i answer that i had spent it on a dog he laugh outright and
said
prai that it is not an omen and that you mai not follow the gold
piec to the dog well i like you for speak the truth when you
ar tempt to do otherwis will you be pleas to shelter for a while
beneath the roof of john grimmer the merchant knave
you mock me sir i stammer
perhap perhap but there mani a true word spoken in jest for
if you do not know it now you will learn it afterward that we ar all
knave each in hi own fashion who if we do not deceiv other
at least deceiv ourselv and i perhap more than most vaniti of
vaniti all is vaniti
then wait for no repli he drew a silver whistl from under hi
dusti robe and blew it whereonso swiftli that i marvel whether he
were waitinga stoutbuilt serv man appear to whom he said
take these hors to the stabl and treat them as though thei were my
own unload the pack beast and when it ha been clean set the mail
and the other gear upon it in the room that ha been made readi for thi
young master hubert of hast my nephew
without a word the man led off the hors
be not afraid chuckl john grimmer for though i am a knave dog
doe not eat dog and what is your is safe with me and those who
serv me now enter and he led the wai into the hous open the
ironstud oak door with a kei from hi pouch
within wa a shop where i saw preciou thing such as fur and gold
ornament ly about
the crumb to catch the bird especi the ladybird he said with
a sweep of hi hand then took me through the shop into a passag
and thenc to a room on the right it wa not a larg room but more
wonderfulli furnish than ani i had ever seen in the centr wa a
tabl of black oak with cunningli carv leg on which stood cup of
silver and a nobl centr piec that seem to be of gold from the
ceil too hung silver lamp that alreadi had been lit for the
even wa close in and gave a sweet smell there wa a hearth also
with what wa rare a chimnei upon which burn a littl fire of log
while the wall were hung with tapestri and broider silk
whilst i stare about me my uncl took off hi cloak beneath which he
wa cloth in some rich but rather threadbar stuff onli retain the
velvet skullcap that he wore then he bade me do the same and when i
had laid my outer garment asid look me all over in the lamplight

i obei and take me by my curl hair with hi delic hand he
drew down my head and kiss me on the brow mutter neither chick

it honour
then he motion to me to be seat and rang a littl silver bell that
stood upon the tabl as in the case of the man without it wa answer
instantli from which i judg that master grimmer wa well serv
befor the echo of the bell di awai a door open the tapestri
swung asid and there appear two most come serv maid tall and
wellshap both of them bear food

chapter iv
kari
thu began my life in london in the hous of my uncl john grimmer
who wa call the goldsmith in truth howev he wa more than thi
sinc not onli did he fashion and trade in costli thing he lent out
monei to interest upon secur to great peopl who need it and
even to the king richard and hi court also he own ship and did much
commerc with holland franc ye and with spain and itali inde
although he appear so humbl hi wealth wa veri larg and alwai
increas like a snowbal roll down a hill moreov he own much
land especi in the neighbourhood of london where it wa like to
grow in valu
monei melt he would sai fur corrupt with moth and time and
thiev break in and steal but landif the titl be goodremain
therefor bui land which none can carri awai near to a market or a
grow town if mai be and hire it out to fool to farm or sell it
to other fool who wish to build great hous and spend their good in
feed a multitud of idl servant hous eat hubert and the larger
thei ar the more thei eat
no word did he sai to me as to my dwell on with him yet there i
remain by common consent as it were inde on the morrow of my
come a tailor appear to measur me for such garment as he thought
i should wear by hi command i suppos as i wa never ask for
payment and he bade me furnish my chamber to my own like also
anoth room at the back of the hous that wa much larger than it
seem which he told me wa to be mine to work in though at what i wa
to work he did not sai
for a dai or two i remain idl stare at the sight of london
and onli meet my uncl at meal which sometim we at alon and
sometim in the compani of seacaptain and learn clerk or of other
merchant all of whom treat him with great defer and as i soon
guess were in truth hi servant at night howev we were alwai
alon and then he would pour out hi wisdom on me while i listen
sai littl on the sixth dai grow weari of thi idl i made
bold to ask him if there wa aught that i could do
ay plenti if you have a mind to work he answer sit down now
and take pen and paper and write what i shall tell you
then he dictat a short letter to me as to ship wine from spain
and when it wa sand read it carefulli
you have it right he said seem pleas and your script is
clear if boyish thei taught you none so ill yonder at hast where
i thought you had onli learn to handl rope and arrow work ye
there is plenti of it of the more privat sort which i do not give to
thi scribe or to that who might betrai my secret for know he went
on in a stern voic there is on thing which i never pardon and it is
betray rememb that nephew hubert even in the arm of your love
if you should be fool enough to seek them or in your cup
so he talk on and while he did so went to an iron chest that he
unlock and thenc drew out a parchment roll which he bade me take to
my workroom and copi there i did so and found that it wa an inventori
of hi good and estat and oh befor i had done i wish that there
were fewer of them all the long dai i labour onli stop for a
bite at noon till my head swam and my finger ach yet as i did so
i felt proud for i guess that my uncl had set me thi task for two
reason first to show hi trust in me and secondli to acquaint
me with the state of hi possess but as it were in the wai of
busi by nightfal i had finish and check the copi which with
the origin i hid in my robe when the greenrob wait maid summon
me to eat
at our meal my uncl ask me what i had seen that dai and i
repliednaught but figur and crab writingand hand him the
parchment which he compar item by item
i am pleas with you he said at last for heresofar i find but a
singl error and that is my fault not your also you have done two
dai work in on still it is not fit that you who ar accustom
to the open air should bend continu over deed and inventori
therefor tomorrow i shall have anoth task for you for like
yourself your hors need exercis
and so he had for with two stout servant ride with me and guid
me he sent me out of london to view a fair estat of hi upon the
border of the thame and to visit hi tenant there and make report of
their husbandri also of certain wood where he propos to fell oak for
shipbuild thi i did for the servant made me known to the tenant
and got back at nightfal abl to tell him all which he wa glad to
learn sinc it seem that he had not seen thi estat for five long
year
on anoth dai he sent me to visit ship in which good of hi were
be laden at the wharf and on anoth took me with him to a sale of
fur that came from the far north where i wa told the snow never melt
and there is alwai ic in the sea
also he made me known to merchant with whom he trade and to hi
agent who were mani though for the most part secret togeth with
other goldsmith who held monei of hi and in a sens were partner
form a kind of compani so that thei could find great sum in sudden
need lastli hi clerk and depend were made to understand that if
i gave an order it must be obei though thi did not happen until i
had been with him for some time
thu it came about that within a year i knew all the thread of john
grimmer great busi and within two it drift more and more into
my hand the last part of it with which he made me acquaint wa that
of lend monei to those in high place and even to the state itself
but at length i wa taught thi also and came to know sundri of these
men who in privat were humbl borrow but if thei met us in the
street pass us with the nod that the great give to their inferior
then my uncl would bow low keep hi ey fix upon the ground and
bid me do the same but when thei were out of hear he would chuckl
and sai
fish in my net goldfish in my net see how thei shine who present
must wriggl on the shore vaniti of vaniti all is vaniti and
doubtless solomon knew such in hi dai
hard i work and ever harder toil at the mill of all these larg
affair and keep myself in health dure such time as i could spare
by shoot at the butt with my big bow where i found that none could
beat me or practis sword plai in a school of arm that wa kept by
a master of the craft from itali also on holidai and on sundai after
mass i rode out of london to visit my uncl estat where sometim i
slept a night and onc or twice sail to holland or to calai with hi
cargo
on dai it wa when i had been with him about eighteen month he said
to me suddenli
you plough the field hubert and do not tith the crop but live upon
the bounti of the husbandman henceforward take as much of it as you
will i ask no account
so i found myself rich though in truth i spent but littl both becaus
my tast were simpl and it wa part of my uncl polici to make no
show which he said would bring envi on us from thi time forward he
began to withdraw himself from busi the truth be that ag took
hold of him and he grew feebl the highest of the affair he left to
me onli inquir of them and give hi counsel from time to time
still becaus he must do someth he busi himself in the shop
which as he said he kept as a trap for the bird chaffer in
ornament and fur as though hi bread depend upon hi earn a gold
piec and direct the manufactur of beauti jewel and cup which
he who wa an artist design to be made by hi skill and highli
paid workmen some of whom were foreign
we end where we began he would sai a smith wa i from my
childhood and a smith i shall die what a fate for on of the blood of
thorgrimm yet i am sell you into the same bondag or so it would
seem but who know who know we design but god decre
it is to be note that when old men ceas from the occup of their
live often enough within a veri littl time thei also ceas from life
itself so it wa with my uncl dai by dai he fade till at last at
the begin of the third winter after i came to him he took to hi bed
where he lai grow ever weaker till at length he di in the hour of
the birth of the new year
to the last hi mind remain clear and strong and never more so than
on the night of hi death that even after i had eaten i went to hi
room as usual and found him read a beauti manuscript of the book
of the wisdom of solomon that is call ecclesiast a work which he
prefer to all other sinc it thought were hi i gather me
also silver and gold and the peculiar treasur of king he read
aloud whether to himself or to me i knew not and went on so i wa
great and increas more than all that were befor me then i
look on all the work that my hand had wrought and on the labour
that i had labour to do and behold all wa vaniti and vexat of
spirit and there wa no profit under the sun
he close the book sai
so shall you find nephew you and everi man in the evil dai of ag
when you shall sai i have no pleasur in them hubert i am go to
my long home nor do i griev in youth i met with sorrow for though i
have never told you i wa marri then and had on son a bright boi
and oh i love him and hi mother then came the plagu and took them
both so have naught left and be by natur on of those who could
wean himself from women which i fear that you ar not hubert note
all the miseri there is in the world and how those who ar call nobl
whom i hate grind down the humbl and the poor i turn myself to good
work half of all my gain i have given and still give to those who
minist to poverti and sick you will find a list of them when i am
gone should you wish to continu the bounti as to which i do not desir
to bind you in ani wai for know hubert that i have left you all that
is mine the gold and the ship with the movabl and chattel to
be your own but the land which ar the main wealth for life and
afterward to be your children or if you should die childless then
to go to certain hospit where the sick ar tend
now i would have thank him but he wave my word asid and went on
you will be a veri rich man hubert on of the richest in all london
yet set not your heart on wealth and abov all do not ap nobil or
strive to climb from the honest class of which you come into the rank
of those idl and dissolut cutthroat and pickbrain who ar call
the great lighten their pocket if you will but do not seek to wear
their silken scent garment that is my counsel to you
he paus a while pick at the bedcloth as the dy do and
continu
you told me that your mother thought you would be a wander and it
is strang that now my mind should be as her wa in thi matter for
i seem to see you far awai amidst war and love and splendour hold
waveflam aloft as did that thorgrimm who begat us well go where
you ar call or as occas drive though you have much to keep you
at home i would that you were wed sinc marriag is an anchor that few
ship can drag yet i am not sure for how know i whom you should wed
and onc that anchor is down no windlass will wind it up and death alon
can cut it chain on word more though you ar so young and strong
rememb that as i am so shall you be todai for me tomorrow for
thee said the wise old man and thu it ever wa and is
hubert i do not know why we ar born to struggl and to suffer and at
last be noos with the rope of doom yet i hope the priest ar right
and that we live again though solomon thought not so that is if we
live where there is neither sin nor sorrow nor fear of death if so be
sure that in some new land we shall meet afresh and there i shall ask
account of you of the wealth i entrust to your keep think of me
kindli at time for i have learn to love you who ar of my blood and
while we live on in the heart of those we love we ar not truli dead
come hither that i mai bless you in your come in and go out while
you still look upon the sun
so he bless me in beauti and tender word and kiss me on the
brow after which he bade me leav him and send the woman to watch him
becaus he desir to sleep
when she look at him at midnight just as the bell rang in the new
year he wa dead
accord to hi wish john grimmer the last of that name wa buri by
the bone of hi forgotten wife and child who had left the world over
fifti year befor in the chancel of that church in the cheap which
wa within a stone throw of hi dwell hous by hi desir also
the funer wa without pomp yet mani came to it some of them of high
distinct although the dai wa cold and snowi i note moreov the
defer thei show to me who by now wa known to be hi heir even
if thei had never spoken with me befor as wa the case with certain
of them take occas to draw me asid and sai that thei trust that
their ancient friendship with my honour uncl would be continu by
myself
afterward i look up their name in hi privat book and found that
on and all of those who had spoken thu ow monei to hi estat
when the will wa sworn and i found myself the master of mani legion
or rather of more monei land and other wealth than i had ever dream
of at first i wa mind to be rid of trade and to take up my abod
upon on or other of my manor where i might live in plenti for the
rest of my dai in the end howev i did not do so partli becaus
i shrank from new face and surround and partli becaus i wa sure
that such would not have been my uncl wish
instead i set myself to plai and outpass hi game he had di veri
rich i determin that i would die five or ten time richer the
richest man in england if i could not becaus i care for monei of
which inde i spent but littl upon myself but becaus the get
of it and the power that it brought seem to me the highest kind
of sport so bend my mind to the matter i doubl and trebl hi
enterpris on thi line and on that and won and won again for even
where skill and foresight fail fortun stood my friend with a such
strang persist that at length i becam superstiti and grew
frighten of her gift also i took pain to hide my great rich from
the public ey place much of them in the name of other whom i could
trust and live most modestli in the same old hous lest i should
becom a man envi by the hungri and mark for plunder by the
spendthrift great
it wa dure the summer follow my uncl death that i went to the
wharv to see to the unload of a ship that came in from venic
bear mani good from the east on my account such as ivori silk
spice glass carpet and i know not what have finish my busi
and seen these preciou thing wareh i hand over the check of
a list of them to anoth and turn to seek my hors
then it wa that i saw a number of halfgrown lad and other idler
mob a man who stood among them wrap in a robe of what look like
tatter sheepskin yet wa not becaus the wool on it wa of a reddish
hue and veri long and soft which robe wa thrown over hi head hide
hi face at thi mana tall figur who stood there patient like
a martyr at the stakethes lewd fellow were hurl offal such as
fish head and rot fruit that lai in plenti on the quai togeth
with coars word blackamoor wa on i caught
such sight were common enough but there wa a quiet digniti of
bear about thi victim which move me so that i went to the rabbl
command them to desist on of them a rough bumpkin not know
who i wa push me asid bid me mind my own busi whereupon
be veri strong i dealt him such a blow between the ey that he
went down like a fell ox and lai there half stun hi companion
begin to threaten me i blew upon my whistl whereon two of my
servingmen without whom i seldom rode in those troublou time ran
up from behind a shed lai hand upon their short sword on see
which the idler took to their heel
when thei had gone i turn to look at the stranger whose hood had
fallen back in the hustl and saw that he wa about thirti year of
ag and of a dark and nobl counten beardless but with straight
black hair black flash ey and an aquilin nose anoth thing
i note about him wa that the lobe of hi ear wa pierc and in a
strang fashion sinc the gristl wa stretch to such a size that
a small appl could have been place within it ring for the rest the
man limb were so thin as though from hunger that everywher hi
bone show while hi skin wa scar with cut and scratch and
on hi forehead wa a larg bruis he seem bewild also and veri
weak yet i think he understood that i wa plai a friend part to
him for he bow toward me in a state courteou wai and kiss the
air thrice but what thi meant at the time i did not know
i spoke to him in english but he shook hi head gentli to show that he
did not understand then as though by an afterthought he touch hi
breast sever time and after each touch said in a voic of strang
soft kari which i took it he meant wa hi name at ani rate
from that time forward i call him kari
now the question wa how to deal with him leav him there to be mock
or to perish i could not nor wa there anywher whither i could send
him therefor it seem the onli thing to do wa to take him home with
me so grasp hi arm gentli i led him off the quai where our hors
were and motion to him to mount on that had been ridden by a servant
whom i bade to walk at the sight of these hors howev a great
terror took hold of him for he trembl all over a sweat burst
out upon hi face and clung to me as though for protect make it
evid that he had never seen such an anim befor inde noth
would persuad him to go near them for he shook hi head and point
to hi feet thu show me that he prefer to walk howev weak hi
state
the end of it wa that walk he did and i with him from thame side to
the cheap sinc i dare not leav him alon for fear lest he should
run awai a strang sight we present i lead thi duski wander
through the street and glad wa i that night wa fall so that few
saw us and those who did thought i believ that i wa bring some
foreign thief to jail
at length we reach the boat hous as my dwell wa call from the
imag of the old vike vessel that my uncl had carv and set abov
the door and i led him in stare about him with all hi ey which in
hi thin face look larg as those of an owl take him up the stair
which seem to puzzl him much for at everi step he lift hi leg
high into the air to an empti guest room
here besid the bed and other furnitur wa a silver basin with it
jug on of the beauti thing that john grimmer had brought i know
not whenc on these kari fix hi ey at onc stare at them in
the light of the candl that i had lit as though thei were familiar to
him inde after glanc at me as though for permiss he went to
the jug that wa kept full of water in case of visitor of whom i had
mani on busi lift it and after pour a few drop of the water
on to the floor as though he made some offer drank deepli thu
show that he wa parch with thirst
then without more ado he fill the basin and throw off hi tatter
robe began to wash himself to the waist round which he wore anoth
garment of dirti cotton i thought which look like a woman
petticoat watch him i note two thing that hi poor bodi wa as
scratch and scar as though by old thorn wound as were hi face
and hand also mark with great bruis as though from kick and
blow and secondli that hung about hi neck wa a wondrou golden imag
about four inch in length it wa of rude workmanship with knee bent
up under the chin but the face in which littl emerald were set for
ey wa of a great and solemn digniti
thi imag kari wash befor he touch himself with water bow to
it the while and when he saw me observ him look upward to the
sky and said a word that sound like pachacamac from which i took
it to be some idol that the poor man worship lastli ti about hi
middl wa a hide bag fill with i knew not what
now i found a washbal made of oil of oliv mix with beech ash and
show him the us of it at first he shrank from thi strang thing
but come to understand it offic serv himself of it readili
smile when he saw how well it cleans hi flesh further i fetch
a shirt of silk with a pair of easi shoe and a furlin robe that had
belong to my uncl also hosen and show him how to put them on
which he learn quickli enough a comb and a brush that were on the
tabl he seem to understand alreadi for with them he dress hi
tangl hair
when all wa finish in a fashion i led him down the stair again to
the eatingroom where supper wa wait and offer him food at
the sight of which hi ey glisten for clearli he wa wellnigh
starv the chair i gave him he would not sit on whether from respect
for me or becaus it wa strang to him i do not know but see a low
stool of tapestri which my uncl had us to rest hi feet he crouch
upon thi and thu at of whatev i gave him veri delic though
he wa so hungri then i pour wine from portug into a goblet and
drank some myself to show him that it wa harmless which after tast
it he swallow to the last drop
the meal be finish which i thought it wa well to shorten lest
he should eat too much who wa so weak again he lift up hi ey as
though in gratitud and as a sign of thank or so i suppos
knelt befor me took my hand and press it against hi forehead
therebi although i did not know it at the time vow himself to
my servic then see how weari he wa i conduct him back to the
chamber and point out the bed to him shut my ey to show that
he should sleep there but thi he would not do until he had drag the
bed on to the floor from which i gather that hi peopl whoever
thei might be had the habit of sleep on the ground
greatli did i wonder who thi man wa and from what race he sprang
sinc never had i seen ani human be who resembl him at all of on
thing onli wa i certain name that hi rank wa high sinc no nobl
of the countri that i knew had a bear so gentl or manner so fine
of black men i had seen sever who were call negro and other of
a higher sort call moor gross vulgar fellow for the most part and
cutthroat if in an illhumour but never a on of them like thi kari
it wa long befor my curios wa satisfi and even then i did not
gather much by slow degre kari learn english or someth of it
though never enough to talk fluentli in that tongu into which he alwai
seem to translat in hi mind from anoth full of strang figur of
thought and speech when after mani month he had master suffici of
our languag i ask him to tell me hi stori which he tri to do all
i could make of it howev came to thi
he wa he said the son of a king who rule over a mighti empir far
far awai across thousand of mile of sea toward that part of the sky
where the sun sank he declar that he wa the eldest law son born
of the king sister which seem dread to my idea though perhap
he meant cousin or rel but that there were score of other
children of hi father which if true show that thi king must be
a veri looseliv man who resembl in hi domest the wise
solomon of whom my uncl wa so fond
it appear further accord to the tale that thi king hi father
had anoth son born of a differ mother and that of thi son he wa
fonder than of my guest kari hi name wa urco and he wa jealou
of and hate kari the law heir moreov as is common a woman came
into the busi sinc kari had a wife the loveliest ladi in all the
land though as i understood not of the same tribe or blood as himself
and with thi wife of hi urco fell in love so greatli did he desir
her although he had plenti of wive of hi own that be the gener
of the king troop he sent kari with the consent of their father to
command an armi that wa to fight a distant savag nation hope
that he would be kill much as david did in the matter of uriah
and bathsheba of whom the bibl tell the stori but as it happen
instead of be kill like uriah kari conquer the distant nation
and after two year return to the king court where he found that
hi brother urco had led astrai hi wife whom he had taken into hi
household be veri angri kari recov hi wife by command of the
king and put her to death becaus of her faithless
thereon the king hi father a stern man order him into banish
becaus he had broken the law of the land which did not permit of
privat vengeanc over a matter of a woman who wa not even of the royal
blood howev fair she might be befor he went howev urco who wa
mad at the loss of hi love caus some kind of poison to be given to
kari which although it doe not kill for he dare not kill him becaus
of hi station depriv him who take it of hi reason sometim
for ever and sometim for a year or more after thi said kari he
rememb littl or noth save long travel in boat and through
forest and then again upon a raft or boat on which he wa driven
alon for mani mani dai drink a jar of water which he had with
him and eat some dri flesh and with it a marvel drug of hi
peopl some of which remain to him in the leathern bag that ha power
to keep the life in a man for week even if he is labour hard
at last he declar he wa pick up by a great ship such as he had
never seen befor though of thi ship he recal littl inde he
rememb noth more until he found himself upon the quai where i
discov him and of a sudden hi mind seem to return but he said
he believ that he had come ashor in a boat in which were fishermen
have been thrown into it by the peopl on the ship which went on
elsewher and that he had walk up the shore of a river thi stori
the bruis on hi forehead and bodi seem to bear out but it wa far
from clear and by the time i learn it month afterward of cours no
trace of the fishermen or their boat could be found i ask him the
name of the countri from which he came he answer that it wa call
tavantinsuyu he ad that it wa a wonder countri in which were
citi and church and great snowclad mountain and fertil vallei
and high plain and hot forest through which ran wide river
from all the learn men whom i could meet especi those who
had travel far i made inquiri concern thi countri call
tavantinsuyu but none of them had so much as heard it name inde
thei declar that my brown man must have come from africa and that hi
mind be disord he had invent thi wondrou land which he said
lai far awai to the west where the sun sank
so there i must leav thi matter though for my part i wa sure that
kari wa not mad whatev he might have been in the past a great
dreamer he wa it is true who declar that the poison which hi
brother had given him had eaten a hole in hi mind through which he
could see and hear thing which other could not thu he wa abl to
read the secret motiv of men and women with wonder clear so
much so that sometim i ask him laugh if he could not give me
some of that poison that i might see into the heart of those with whom
i dealt of anoth thing too he wa alwai certain name that he
would return to hi countri tavantinsuyu of which he thought dai and
night and that i should accompani him at thi i laugh again and
said that if so it would be after we were both dead
by degre he learn english quit well and even how to read and write
it teach me in return much of hi own languag which he call
quichua a soft and beauti tongu though he said that there were
also mani other in hi countri includ on that wa secret to the
king and hi famili which he wa not allow to reveal although he knew
it in time i master enough of thi quichua to be abl to talk to kari
in brief sentenc of it when i did not wish other to understand what i
said
to tell the truth while i studi thu and listen to hi marvel
tale a great desir aros in me to see thi land of hi and to open
up a trade with it sinc there he declar gold wa as plenti as
wa iron with us i thought even of make a voyag of discoveri to
the west but when i spoke of it to certain seacaptain even the most
venturesom mock at me and said that thei would wait for that journei
till thei went west themselv by which in their sea parlanc that
thei had learn in the mediterranean thei meant until thei di
when i told kari thi he smile in hi mysteri wai and answer that
all the same i and he should make that journei togeth and thi befor
we di a thing that came about inde though not by my own will or
hi
of late there ha been much disput as to the origin of
the phrase to go west or in other word to die sure
it aris from the custom of the ancient egyptian who
after death were ferri across the nile and entomb upon
the western shore
for the rest when kari saw my workmen fashion gold and set
jewel in it for sale to the nobl and ladi of the court he wa much
interest and ask if he might be allow to follow thi craft of
which he said he understood someth and thu earn the bread he at i
answer ye for i knew that it irk hi proud natur to be depend
on me and gave him gold and silver with a littl room have a furnac
in it where he could labour the first thing he made wa an object about
two inch across round and with a groov at the back of it on the
front of which he fashion an imag of the sun have a human face and
rai of light project all about i ask him what wa it purpos
whereon he took the piec and thrust it into the lobe of hi ear where
the gristl had been stretch in the fashion that i have describ
which it fit exactli then he told me that in hi countri all
the nobl wore such ornament and that those who did so were call
earmen to distinguish them from the common peopl also he told me
mani other thing too long to set out which made me desir more than
ever to see thi empir with my ey for an empir and no less he
declar it to be
afterward kari made mani such ornament which i sold for brooch with
a pin set at the back of them also he shape other thing for hi
skill as a goldsmith wa wonder such as cup and platter of strang
design and rich ornament which command a great price but on
everi on of them in the centr or some other part of the emboss
appear thi imag of the sun i ask him why he answer becaus the
sun wa hi god and hi peopl were sunworshipp i remind him that
he had said that a certain pachacamac whose imag he wore about hi neck
wa hi god to thi he repli
ye pachacamac is the god abov god the creator the spirit of the
world but the sun is hi visibl hous and raiment that all mai see
and worship a sai that i thought had truth in it see that all
natur is the raiment of god
i tri to instruct him in our faith but although he listen patient
and i think understood he would not becom a christian make it
veri plain to me that he thought that a man should live and die in the
religion in which he wa born and that from what he saw in london he did
not hold that christian were ani better than those who worship
the sun and the great spirit pachacamac so i abandon thi attempt
although there wa danger to him while he remain a heathen inde
twice or thrice the priest made inquiri concern hi faith be
curiou as to all that had to do with him howev i silenc them by
pretend that i wa instruct him as well as i wa abl and that as
yet he did not know enough english to hearken to their holi exposit
also when thei becam persist i made gift to the monasteri to
which thei belong or if thei were parish priest then to their cur
or church
still i wa troubl about thi matter for some of these priest were
veri fierc and intoler and i wa sure that in time thei would push
the busi further
on more thing i notic about kari name that he shrank from women
and inde seem to hate them the maid who had remain with me sinc
my uncl death notic thi by natur as it were and in reveng
would not serv him the end of it wa that fear lest thei should do
him some evil turn with the priest or otherwis i sent them awai and
hire men to take their place thi distast of kari for women i set
down to all that he had suffer at the hand of hi fals and beauti
wife not wrongli as i think
chapter v
the come of blanch
on dai it wa the last of the year the anniversari of the death of my
uncl whose good and wisdom i ponder on more and more as time went
by have a littl time to spare from larger affair i chanc to be
in the shop in the front of the hous which as john grimmer had said
he kept as a trap to snare the ladybird and i continu becaus i
knew that he would not wish that anyth should be chang here i wa
pleas myself by look over such piec as we had to sell which the
head craftsman wa show to me sinc myself i knew littl of them
except as a matter of account
whilst i wa thu engag there enter the shop a veri fine ladi
accompani by a still finer lordl arrai so similarli that at
first sight in their hood ermin cloak it wa difficult to know
which wa man and which wa woman when thei threw these asid howev
for the shop wa warm after the open air i knew more than that sinc
with a sudden stoppag of the heart i saw befor me none other than the
ladi blanch alei and her rel the lord deleroi
she who in the old dai of the hast burn had been but a lili
bud wa now an open flower and beauti exceedingli inde in her own
fashion the most beauti woman that ever i beheld tall she wa and
state as a lili bloom white as a lili also save for those wondrou
blue ey over which curl the dark lash in shape too she wa
perfect fullbreast yet not too full smallwaist and with
delic limb a veri venu such an on as i had seen in ancient
marbl brought in a ship from itali and given as i believ to the
king who love such thing to be set up in hi palac
my lord also wa yet handsom than he had been more set and manli
though still he affect hi coxcomb partycolour dress with the
turnedup shoe of which the point were fasten by littl golden
chain beneath the knee still he wa a fine man with hi rove black
ey hi loos mouth and littl point beard from which as from hi
hair came an odour of scent see me in my merchant gown for i
remain mind of my uncl advic as regard attir he spoke to me
as great men do to shopkeep
well met goldsmith he said in hi round welltrain voic i
would make a newyear gift to the ladi here and i am told that you have
platewar of the best gold cup and jewel of rich and rare design
stamp all of them with the imag of the sun which on would wish to
rememb on such a dai as thi but hearken let john grimmer himself
come to serv me for i would treat with no underl or take me to him
where he is
now i bow befor him rub my hand and answer for so the
humour led me then i fear that i must take my lord farther than my
lord would wish to travel just at present though who know perchanc
like the rest of us he mai take that journei sooner than he think
now at the sound of my voic i saw the ladi blanch stare at me try
to catch sight of my face beneath the hood which i wore on thi cold
dai while deleroi start and said briefli
your mean
it is plain my lord john grimmer is dead and i know not where
he dwell at present sinc he took that secret with him but i who
unworthili carri on hi trade am at your lordship servic
then i turn and bade the shopman command kari to come hither and bring
with him the choicest of our cup and jewel
he went and i busi myself in set stool for these nobl custom
to rest on befor the fire as i did so by chanc my hand touch that
of the ladi blanch whereat onc more she strove to peer beneath my
hood it wa as though the natur in her knew that touch again as by
some instinct everi woman doe if onc the toucher lip have been
near her own though it be long ago but i onli turn my head awai and
drew that hood the closer
now kari came and with him the shopman bear the preciou ware kari
wore a woollin robe veri plain which yet becam him so well that
with hi finecut face and flash ey he look like an eastern
princ disguis at him thi fine pair stare for never had thei seen
such a man but take no note with mani bow he show the jewel on
by on among these wa a gem of great valu a larg heartshap rubi
that kari had set in a surround of twist golden serpent with head
rais to strike and littl ey of diamond upon thi brooch the ladi
blanch fix her gaze and discard all other began to plai with it
till at length the lord deleroi ask the price i consult with kari
explain that myself i did not handl thi branch of my busi then
name it carelessli it wa a great sum
god truth blanch said deleroi thi merchant think i am made of
gold you must choos a cheaper ornament for your new year gift or he
will have to wait for payment
which mayhap i should be will to do from on of your qualiti my
lord i interrupt bow
he look at me and said
can i have a word apart with you merchant
again i bow and led him to the eatingroom where he gaze about him
amaz at the rich of the furnish he sat him down upon a carven
chair while i stood befor him humbl and wait
i am told he said at length that john grimmer did other busi
besid that of sell jewel
ye my lord some foreign trade
and some home trade also i mean that he lent monei
at time my lord and on good secur if he chanc to have ani at
command and at a certain interest perhap my lord will come to hi
point
it is short and clear those of us who ar at court alwai want monei
where it is need if we would have advanc and earn the royal
favour of on who doe not pai at least in gold
be pleas to state the amount and the secur offer my lord
he did so the sum wa high and the secur wa bad
ar there ani who would stand sureti for my lord
ye on of great estat sir robert alei who ha wide land in
sussex
i have heard the name and if my lord will bid hi lawyer put the
matter in write i will caus the land to be valu and give an
answer as quickli as mai be
for a young man you ar care merchant
ala such as i need to be who must guard our small earn in these
troublou time of war and tumult such a sum as you speak of would take
all that john grimmer and i have laid by after year of toil
again he look at the furnish of the room and shrug hi
shoulder then said
good it shall be done for the need is urgent to whom is the letter to
be sent
to john grimmer at the boat hous cheapsid
but you told me that john grimmer wa dead
and so he is my lord but hi name remain
then we return to the sop and as we went i said
if your lordship ladi should set her heart upon the rubi the cost of
it can stand over a while sinc i know that it is hard for a husband to
disappoint a wife of what she desir
man she is my distant cousin not my wife i would she were but how
can two highplac pauper wed
perhap it is for thi reason that my lord wish to borrow monei
again he shrug hi shoulder and as we enter the shop i threw back
the hood from off my head upon which i wore a merchant cap of velvet
the ladi blanch caught sight of me and start
sure sure she began you ar he who shot the three arrow at
the cave mouth at hast
ye my ladi and did your hawk escap the dog upon the london road
nai it wa crippl and di which wa the first of mani troubl
for i think my luck rode awai with you that dai master hubert of
hast she ad with a sigh
there ar other hawk and luck return i repli bow perhap
thi trinket will bring it back to you my ladi and take the
snakesurround rubi heart i proffer it to her with anoth bow
oh she said her blue ey shine with pleasur oh it is
beauti but whenc is the price to come for so costli a thing
i think the matter is on that can wait
at that moment the lord deleroi broke in sai
so you ar the man who slew the french knight with an ancient sword
and afterward shot three other frenchmen with three shaft send
on of them through shield and mail and bodi a tale that wa spoken of
afterward even in london god truth you should be serv the king
in the war not yourself behind the counter
there ar mani wai of serv my lord i answer by pen and
merchandis as well as by steel and shaft now with me it is the turn
of the former though perhap the ancient sword and the great black bow
wait till their time come again
he stare at me and mutter half to himself
a strang merchant and a grim as those dead frenchmen mai have
thought i tell you sir trader that your talk and the ey of that
tall moor of your turn my back cold it is as though someon walk
over my grave come blanch let us begon er our hors be chill as
i am master grimmer or hast you shall hear from me unless i can
do my busi otherwis and for the trinket send me a note at your
leisur
then thei went but as the ladi blanch left the shop she caught her
robe and turn to free it while she did so flash at me on of her
sweet look such as i rememb well
kari follow to the door and watch them mount their hors at the
gate then he search the ground with hi ey
what wa it hook her cloak i ask
a dream or the air master for there is noth els to which it
could have hung those who would throw spear behind them must first
turn round
what think you of those two kari
i think that thei will not pai for your jewel but perhap thi wa but
a bait upon the hook
and what more kari
i think that the ladi is veri fair and fals and that the great lord
heart is as black as ar hi ey also i think that thei ar dear to
each other and well match but it seem that you have met them both
befor master so you will know better about them than your slave
ye i have met them i answer sharpli for hi word about blanch
anger me ad i have note kari that you have never a good word
for ani on whom i favour you ar jealousnatur kari especi of
women
you ask i answer he repli fall into broken english as wa hi
fashion when move and it is true that those who have much love ar
much jealou that is a fault in my peopl also i love not women now
i go make anoth piec for that which master give the ladi onli thi
time it all snake and no heart
he went take the trai of jewel with him and i too went to the
eatingroom to think
how strang wa thi meet i had never forgotten the ladi blanch
but in a sens i had live her memori down and mind of my uncl
counsel had not sought to look upon her again for which reason i kept
awai from hast where i thought that i should find her and now here
she wa in london and in my hous brought thither by fate nor wa that
all sinc those blue ey of her had relight the dead fire in my
heart and seat there alon i knew that i love her inde had never
ceas to love her she wa more to me than all my wealth more than
anyth and ala between us there wa still a great gulf fix
she wa not wed it wa true but she wa a highli place ladi and i
but a merchant who could not even call myself a squir or by law wear
garment made of certain stuff which i handl daili in my trade how
might that gulf be cross
then as i muse there rose in my mind a memori of certain sai of my
wise old uncl and with it an answer to the question gold would bridg
the widest stream of human differ these fine folk for all their
flaunt were poor thei came to me to borrow monei wherewith to gild
their coronet and satisfi the importun creditor at their door lest
thei should be pull from their high place and forc back into the
number of the common herd as those who could no longer either give or
pai
and after all wa thi differ between them and me so wide the
grandsir of sir robert alei i had been told gather hi wealth by
trade and usuri in the old war inde it wa said that he wa on who
dealt in cattl while lord deleroi wa report to be a bastard if of
the bluest blood so blue that it ran nigh to the royal purpl well
what wa mine on the father side saxon descend from that of thane
who went down befor the norman and thereaft becam humbl land
folk of the lesser sort on the mother of the race of the old
seak who slew and conquer through all the world thei knew wa i
then so far beneath these other nai but like my father and my uncl i
wa on who bought and sold and the hand of the dyer wa stain to the
colour of hi vat
thu stood the busi i a stubborn man not illfavour to whom
fortun had given wealth wa determin to win thi woman who it
seem to me look upon me with no unkind ey sinc i had save her
from certain peril to myself then and there i swore i would win her
the question washow could it be done i might enter the servic of
the king and fight hi battl and doubtless win myself a knighthood or
more which would open the close gate
nai it would take too long and someth warn me that time press
that strang foreign man kari said that blanch wa enamour of thi
deleroi and although i wa wrath with him set hi word down to
jealousi of ani on whom i look with kind i knew well that kari
saw far if i tarri thi rare white bird would slip from my hand into
anoth cage i must stir at onc or let the matter be well i had
wealth so let wealth be my friend time enough to try war when it
fail me
on the third dai of the new year which at thi time of court revelri
show that the matter must inde be press i receiv those
particular for which i had ask togeth with a list of the land and
tenement that sir robert alei wa readi to put in pawn on behalf of
hi friend and rel the lord deleroi why should he do thi i
wonder there could onli be on answer becaus he and not deleroi wa
to receiv the monei or most of it
nai anoth came into my mind as probabl becaus he look upon
deleroi as hi heir which should he marri the ladi blanch he would
becom if thi were so i must act and quickli that is if i would
ever see more of the ladi blanch as perchanc i might do by tread
thi goldpav road but not otherwis i studi the list of land
as it chanc i knew most of them for thei lai about pevensei and
hast and saw that thei were scarc worth the monei which were
ask of me well what of it thi matter wa not on of trade and
larg as the sum might be i would risk it for the chanc of win
blanch
the end of it wa that wait for no valu i wrote that on proof of
titl clean and unencumb and complet of all deed i would pai
over the gold to whoever might be appoint to receiv it
thi letter of mine prove to be but the begin of a long busi
whereof the detail mai be left untold on the veri next dai inde
i wa summon to the hous of sir robert alei which wa near to the
palac and abbei of westminst here i found the gruff old knight grown
greyer and have as it seem to me a hunt air and with him the
lord deleroi and two foxi lawyer of whom i did not like the look
inde for the first i suspect that i wa be trick and had it
not been for the ladi blanch would have broken off the loan becaus
of her howev thi i did not do but have state my term anew and
the rate and date of interest sat for a long while sai as littl
as possibl while the other unfold parchment and talk and talk
tell tale that often contradict each other till at length the
lord deleroi who seem ill at eas grew weari and left the chamber
at last all wa done that could be done at that sit and it be
past the hour of dinner i wa taken in to eat consent becaus i
hope that i should see the ladi blanch
a butler or chambergroom led me to the dininghal and sat me with
the lawyer at a tabl beneath the dai present on thi dai appear
sir robert alei hi daughter blanch the lord deleroi and perhap
eight or ten other fine folk whom i had never seen she look about
her saw me seat at the lower tabl and spoke to her father and
deleroi reason with the latter as it would appear inde in
a sudden hush i caught some of her word thei were if you ar not
asham to take hi monei you should not be asham to sit at meat with
him
deleroi stamp hi foot but the end of it wa that i wa summon
to the high tabl where the ladi blanch made place for me besid her
while deleroi sat himself down between two splendid dame at the other
end of the board
here then i stai by blanch who i note wore the rubi heart
encircl by serpent inde thi wa the first thing of which she
spoke to me sai
it look well upon my robe doe it not and i thank you for it master
hubert who know sure that it is not my cousin deleroi gift but
your sinc for it you will never see your monei
by wai of answer i look at the sumptuou plate and furnish the
profus of the viand and the number of the servingmen read my
thought she repli
ay but pledg all of it i tell you master hubert that we ar
starv hound though we live in a kennel with golden bar and now
thei would pawn you that kennel also
then while i wonder what to sai she began to talk of our great
adventur in bygon year recal everi tini thing that had happen
and everi word that had been spoken between us some of which i had
forgotten of on thing onli she said nothingth kiss with which we
part amongst much els she spoke of how the ancient sword had shorn
through the armour of the french knight and i told her that the sword
wa name waveflam and that it had come down to me from my ancestor
thorgrimm the vike and of what wa written on it blade to all of
which she listen greedili
and thei thought you not fit to sit at meat with them you whose race
is so old and who ar so great a warrior as you show that dai and
it is to you that i ow my life and more than life to you and not to
them
so sai she shot a glanc at me that pierc me through and through
as my arrow had pierc the frenchmen and what is more beneath the
cover of the board for a moment let her slim hand rest upon my own
after thi for a while we were silent for inde i could not speak
then we talk on as we could do well enough sinc there wa no on on
my left where the board end and on blanch right wa a fat old
lord who seem to be deaf and occupi himself in drink more than he
should have done i told her much about myself also what my mother had
said to me on the dai of the burn and of how she had prophesi that
i should be a wander word at which blanch sigh and answer
yet you seem to be well plant in london and in rich soil master
hubert
ay ladi but it is not my nativ soil and for the rest we go where
fate lead us
fate what doe that word bring to my mind i have it yonder moor of
your who make those jewel he ha the veri ey of fate and i fear
him
that is strang ladi and yet not so strang for about thi man there
is someth fate ever he swear to me that i shall accompani him to
some dim land where he wa born of which land he is a princ
then i told her all the stori of kari to which she listen openei
and wonder sai when i had finish
so you save thi poor wander also and doubtless he love you well
ye ladi almost too well see that at time he is jealou of me
though god know i did littl for him save pick him from a crowd upon
the quai
ah i guess it who saw him watch you the other dai yet it is
strang for i thought that onli women could be jealou of men and men
of women hush thei ar mock us becaus we talk so friendli
i look up follow her glanc and saw that deleroi and the two fine
ladi between whom he sat all of whom appear to have had enough of
wine were point at us inde in a silenc such as now and again
happen at feast i heard on of them sai
you had best bewar lest that fair white dove of your doe not slip
your hand and begin to coo in anoth ear my lord deleroi and heard
hi answer
nai i have her too fast and who care for a pine dove whereof the
feather adorn anoth cap
whilst i wa wonder what thi dark talk might mean the compani broke
up the ladi blanch glide awai through a door at the back of the
dai follow as i note by deleroi who seem flush and angri
mani time i visit that prodig hous which seem to me to be the
haunt of folk who howev highli place and greatli favour at
court were as loos in their live as thei were in their talk inde
although i wa no saint i like them not at all especi the men
with their scent hair turnedup shoe and partycolour cloth
nor as i thought did sir robert alei like them who whatev hi
fault wa a bluff knight of the older sort who had fought with credit
in the french war yet i note that he seem to be helpless in their
hand or rather in those of deleroi the king favourit who wa the
chief of all the gang it wa as though that gai and handsom young man
had some hold over the old soldier ye and over hi daughter also
though what thi might be i could not guess
now i will move on with the tale in due cours the parchment were
sign and deliv and the monei in good gold wa paid over on my
behalf after which the great household at westminst becam more
prodig than befor but when the time came for the discharg of the
interest due not a groat wa forthcom then afterward there wa talk
of my take over certain of the pledg land in lieu of thi interest
sir robert suggest thi and i assent becaus blanch had told me
that it would help her father onli when the matter wa set on foot
by my lawyer wa it found that these land were not hi to transfer
inasmuch as thei had been alreadi mortgag to their valu
then there wa a fierc quarrel between sir robert alei and the lord
deleroi at which i wa present sir robert with mani oath accus hi
cousin of have forg hi name when he wa absent in franc while
deleroi declar that what he did wa done with due author almost
thei drew sword on each other till at length deleroi took alei asid
and with a fierc grin whisper someth into hi ear which caus the
old knight to sink down on a stool and call out
get you gone you fals rogu get out of thi hous ay and out
of england if i meet you again by god blood i swear that king
favourit or no king favourit ill throat you like a hog
to which deleroi mock in answer
good ill go my gentl cousin which it suit me well to do who have
certain busi of the king await me in franc ay ill go and
leav you to settl with thi worthi trader who mai hold that you have
dupe him do it as you will except in on fashion of which you know
now a word with my cousin blanch and anoth at the palac and i ride
for dover farewel cousin alei farewel worthi merchant for whose
loss i should griev did i not know that soon you will recoup yourself
out of gentl pocket mourn not over me over much either of you sinc
doubtless er so veri long i shall return
now my blood flame up and i answer
i prai you do not hurri my lord lest you should find me wait for
you with a shield and a sword in place of a warrant and a pen
he heard and call out fore god thi chapman think himself a
knight
then with a mock laugh he went
chapter vi
marriageand after
sir robert and i stood face each other speechless with rage both of
us at length he said in a hoars voic
your pardon master hast for the affront that thi bastard
lordl ha put upon you an honest man i tell you that he is a
looseliv knave as you would agre if you knew all hi stori a
cockatric that for my sin i have nurtur in my bosom ti he that
ha wast all my substanc ti he that ha made free of my name so
that i fear me you ar defraud ti he that us my hous as though
it were hi own bring into it vile women of the court and men that
ar viler still howev high their name and gaudi their attir and
he choke with hi wrath and stop
why do you suffer these thing sir i ask
forsooth becaus i must he answer sullenli for he ha me and mine
by the throat thi deleroi is veri power master hast at a word
from him whisper in the king ear i or you or ani man might find
ourselv in the tower accus of treason whenc we should appear no
more
then as though he wish to get awai from the subject of deleroi and
hi hold upon him he went on
i fear me that your monei or much of it is in danger for deleroi
bond is worthless and sinc the land is alreadi pledg without my
knowledg i have nowher to turn for gold i tell you that i am an
honest man if on who ha fallen into ill compani and thi wicked
cut me deep for i know not how you will be repaid
now a thought came to me and as wa my bold fashion in all busi i
act on it instantli
sir robert alei i said should it be pleas to you and anoth
i can see a wai in which thi debt mai be cancel without shame to you
and yet to my profit
then in god name speak it for i see none
sir in bygon time as it chanc i wa abl yonder at hast to do
some servic to your daughter and in that hour she took my heart
he start but motion to me to continu
sir i love her truli and desir more than anyth to make her my
wife i know she is far abov me in station still although but a
merchant i am of good descent as i can prove to you moreov i
am rich for thi monei that i have advanc to you or to the lord
deleroi is but a small part of my wealth which grow dai by dai through
honest trade sir if my suit were accept i should be readi not onli
to help you further on certain term but by deed and will to settl
most of it upon the ladi blanch and upon our children sir what sai
you
sir robert tug at hi red beard and stare down at the floor
present he lift hi head and i saw that hi face wa troubl the
face of a man inde who is struggl with himself or as i thought
with hi pride
a fair offer fairli put he said but the question is not what i
sai but what sai blanch
sir i do not know who have never ask her yet at time i have
thought that her mind toward me is not unkind
is it so well perhap now that hewel let that lie master
hast you have my leav to try your fortun and i tell you straight
that i hope it will be good with your wealth your rank mai be soon
mend and you ar an honest man whom i should be glad to welcom as a
son for i have had enough of these court knave and paint jezebel
but if such is your fanci toward blanch my counsel to you is that you
put it quickli to the proofay man at onc mark my word for such
a swan as she is mani snare ar set beneath the dirti water of thi
court
the sooner the better sir
good ill send her to you and on word moreb not over shy or
readi to take the first no for an answer or to listen to the tale of
bygon fanci such as all women have
then suddenli he went leav me there wonder at hi word and
manner which i did not understand thi i understood howev that he
desir that i should marri blanch which consid all thing i held
somewhat strang although i had the wealth she lack doubtless i
thought it must be becaus hi honour had been touch on the matter
of the trick that had been plai upon him without hi knowledg then i
ceas from these wonder and gave my thought to what i should sai to
blanch
i wait a long while and still she did not come till at last i
believ that she wa awai from the hous or guess my busi had
refus to see me at length howev she enter the room so silent
that i who wa stare at the great abbei through a windowplac never
heard the door open or close i think that some sens of her presenc
must have drawn me sinc suddenli i turn to see her stand befor
me she wa clad all in white have a round cap or coronet upon her
head beneath which her shine fair hair wa loop in braid her
littl coat trim with ermin wa fasten with a singl jewel that
rubi heart embrac by serpent which i had given her she wore no other
ornament thu seen she look most love and most sweet and all my
heart went out in yearn for her
my father tell me that you wish to speak with me so i have come she
said in her low clear voic search my face curious with her larg
ey
i bow my head and paus not know how to begin
how can i serv you who i fear have been ill serv she went on
with a littl smile as though she found amus in my confus
in on wai onli i exclaim by give yourself in marriag to me
for that i seek no less
now her fair face that had been pale becam stain with red and she
let her ey fall as though she were search for someth among the
rush that strew the floor
hearken befor you answer i continu when first i spoke with you
on that bloodi dai at hast and you had but just come to womanhood i
love you and swore to myself that i would die to save you i save you
and we kiss and were part afterward i tri to put you out of my
heart know that you were set far abov me and no meat for such as i
though still for your sake i woo no other woman in marriag the year
went by and fortun brought us togeth again and lo the old love wa
stronger than befor i know that i am not worthi of you who ar so high
and good and pure still and i stop lack word
she move uneasili and the red colour left her cheek as though she had
been suddenli pain

should seek it in a countri garden not in the reek of london

by my faith it should not be difficult with a man so honest and so
well favour and yeta further plea my cousin deleroi ha cheat

father in satisfact of hi honour as men who have no gold offer a
hous or a hors to close a debt

is but a chanc of trade such as i face everi dai still i will be
plain and tell you that i risk it with open ey expect noth
less that i might come near to you
now she sat herself down in a chair cover her face with her hand
and i saw from the trembl of her bodi that she wa sob while i
wonder what to do for the sight wrung me she let fall her hand and
there were tear upon her face

sleep few ar thei that know life war who have no scar to hide and
i am not on of them though in truth your lip made the deepest yonder
by the cave at hast
when she heard thi she colour to her brow and forget her tear
laugh outright while i went on
therefor let the past be and if it is your will let us set our ey
upon the futur onli on promis would i ask of you that never again
will you be alon with the lord deleroi sinc on so lightfing
with a pen would i think steal other thing
by my soul the last thing i desir is to be alon with my cousin
deleroi
now she rose from the chair and for a littl while we stood face
each other then she veri slightli open her arm and lift her face
toward me
thu did blanch alei and i becom affianc though afterward when i
thought the busi over i rememb that never onc did she sai that
she would marri me thi howev troubl me littl sinc in such
matter it is what women do that weigh not what thei sai for the rest
i wa mad with love of her also both then and as the dai went by more
and more did she seem to be travel on thi same road of love if
not inde she act well
within a month we were wed on a certain octob dai in the church of
st margaret at westminst onc it wa agre all desir to push on
thi marriag and not least blanch herself sir robert alei said that
he wish to be gone from london to hi estat in sussex have had
enough of the court and it wai desir there to live quietli till
the end i be so much in love wa on fire for my bride and blanch
herself vow that she wa eager to becom my wife sai that our
courtship which began on hast hill had last long enough for the
rest there wa noth to caus delai i cancel sir robert debt
to me and sign a deed in favour of hi daughter and her offspr
whereof i gave a copi to hi lawyer and there wa nought els to be done
except to prepar my hous for her which with monei at command wa
easi
no great busi wa made of thi marriag sinc neither hi kin nor
sir robert himself wish to nois it about that hi onli child the
last of hi hous wa take a merchant for her husband to save her and
him from wreck nor did i the merchant wish to provok talk amongst
those of my own station especi as it wa known that i had advanc
monei to these fine folk of the court so it came about that few were
ask to the ceremoni that wa fix for an earli hour and of these
not mani came becaus on that dai although it wa but octob a great
gale with storm of rain began to blow the greatest inde that i had
known in my life
thu it chanc that we were wed in an almost empti church while the
fierc wind thunder against the window overcam the feebl voic
of the old priest so that he look like on act in a show without
word the dark caus by the thick rain wa so deep also that
scarc could i see my bride love face or find the finger upon which
i must set the ring
at length it wa done and we went down the aisl to find our hors
whereon we must ride to my hous in cheapsid where there wa to be
a feast for my depend and such of my few friend as care to come
among whom were not number ani grand folk from westminst as we
drew near the church door i note among those who were present those
two gaudi ladi between whom deleroi had sat at that meal after the
busi of the loan wa settl moreov i heard on of them sai
what will deleroi do when he come back to find hi darl gone and
the other answer with a high laugh
seek anoth doubtless or borrow more monei from the merchant
and here i lost their talk in the rush of the wind through the
open door
in the porch wa old sir robert alei
mother of god he shout mai the rest of the live of you two be
smoother than your nuptial no cheapsid feast for me im for home
in such fiend weather farewel son hubert and all joi to you
farewel blanch learn to be obedi as a wife and keep your ey for
your husband face that is my counsel to you till we meet again at
christmastid in sussex whither i ride tomorrow farewel to both of
you
farewel it wa inde for never did either of us look on him again
wrap close in our cloak we battl through the storm and at length
somewhat breathless reach my hous in the cheap where the garland of
autumn flower and greeneri that i had caus to be wreath from post
befor the door were all torn awai by the gale here i welcom my wife
as best i could kiss her as she cross the threshold and sai
certain sweet word that i had prepar to which she smile an answer
then the women took her to her chamber to make herself readi and
afterward came the feast which wa sumptuou of it sort though the
evil weather kept some of the guest awai
scarc had it begun when kari who of late had been sadfac and
brood and who did not eat with us enter and whisper to me that
my master of lade from the dock prai to see me at onc on a matter
which would brook no delai make excus to blanch and the compani
i went out to see him in the shop and found the man much disturb it
seem that a certain vessel of mine that i had rechristen blanch
in honour of my wife which lai in the stream readi to sail wa in
great danger becaus of the tempest inde she wa drag at her
anchor and it wa fear that unless more anchor could be let down she
would come ashor and be wreck against the jettyhead or otherwis
the reason why thi had not been done wa that onli the master and on
sailor were on board the vessel the rest were feast ashor in honour
of my marriag and refus to row out to her sai that the boat
would be swamp in the gale
now thi ship although not veri larg wa the best and staunchest that
i own be almost new moreov the cargo on board of her laden
for the mediterranean wa of great valu so great inde that it loss
would have been veri grievou to me therefor it wa plain that i must
see to the matter without delai sinc from my servant account there
wa no hope that these rebelli sailor would listen to ani lesser man
than myself so if i would save the ship and her cargo i must ride for
the dock at onc
go back to the eatingchamb in a few word i told my wife and the
guest how the matter stood prai the oldest man among the latter
to take my place by the bride which he did unwillingli mutter that
thi wa an unlucki marriag feast
then it wa that blanch rose beseech me earnestli and almost with
tear that i would take her with me to the dock i laugh at her as
did the compani but still she besought with much persist till i
began to believ that she must be afraid of someth though the other
cri that it wa but love and fear lest i should come to harm
in the end i made her drink a cup of wine with me but her hand shook so
much that she spill the cup and the rich red wine ran down her breast
stain the white of her robe whereat some women among the compani
murmur think it a bad omen at length with a kiss i tore myself
awai for i could bide no longer and the hors were wait present
so i wa ride for the dock as fast as the storm would suffer with
tile from the roof and when we were clear of these the tornoff limb
of tree hurtl round me kari i should sai would have accompani
me but i took a servingman bid kari bide where he wa in the
hous in case he might be of servic
at last we came safe to the dock where i found all as my cargomast
had describ the ship blanch wa in great peril and drag everi
minut toward a pierhead which if she struck would stave her in and
make an end of her the men too were still feast in the inn with
their wharfsid trollop and some of them half drunk i spoke to them
show them their shame and sai that if thei would not come i and
my man would take a boat and get aboard alon and thi upon my wed
dai then thei hung their head and came
we won to the ship safe though with much toil and danger and there
found the master almost craze with fear and doubt of the issu and the
man with him injur by a fall block inde thi poor captain clung
to the rail watch the cabl as it drag the anchor and fear
everi moment lest it should part
the rest is soon told we got out two more anchor and did other thing
such as sailor know to help in such a case when all wa as safe as
it could be made i and my man and four sailor start for the quai
tell the master that i would return upon the morrow the wind and
current aid us we land safe and sound and at onc i rode back to
cheapsid
now though it is short to tell all thi had taken a long while also
the wai wa far to ride in such a storm thu it came about that it wa
nigh to ten oclock at night when thank god i dismount at the
gate of my hous and bade the servant take the hors to the stabl as
i drew near the door it open which astonish me and as the light
within show there stood kari what astonish me still more he had
the great sword waveflam in hi hand though not drawn which sword
he must have fetch from where it wa kept with the french knight
armour and the shield that bore three arrow as a cogniz
lai hi finger on hi lip he shut the door softli then said in a
low voic
master there is a man up yonder with the ladi
what man i ask

jewel and borrow gold hearken the feast be finish the guest
went awai at fall of night but the wifeladi withdrew herself into the
chamber that is call sunroom the solar that up the stair which
look out on the street about on hour gone there came a knock at the
door i who wa watch open think it wa you return and
there stood that lord he spoke to me sai
moorman i know that your master is from home but that the ladi is
here i would speak with her
now i would have turn him awai but at that moment the ladi herself

about which i must talk with him so master know that you had lent
monei to thi lord i obei though i like it not and have fetch
the sword which i thought perchanc might be need i wait
thi wa the substanc of what he said though hi talk wa more broken
sinc he never learn to speak english well and help it out with
word of hi own tongu of which as i have told he had taught me
someth
i do not understand i exclaim when he had finish doubtless
it is littl or noth yet give me the sword for who know and come
with me
kari obei and as i went up the stair i buckl waveflam about me
also kari brought two candl of italian wax light upon their stand
come to the door of the solar i tri to open it but it wa bolt
god truth i said thi is strang and hammer on the panel with
my fist
present it open but befor enter it for i fear some trick
i stood without and look in the room wa lit by a hang lamp and
a fire burn brightli on the hearth for the night wa cold in an oak
chair by the fire and stare into it sat blanch still as ani statu
she glanc round and saw me in the light of the candl that kari held
and again stare into the fire halfwai between her and the door stood
deleroi dress as ever in fine cloth though i note that hi cape
wa off and hung over a stool near the fire as though to dry i note
also that he wore a sword and a dagger i enter the room follow by
kari shut the door behind me and shot the bolt then i spoke ask
why ar you here with my wife lord deleroi
it is strang master merchant he answer but i wa about to put
much the same question to you name why is my wife in your hous
now while i reel beneath these word without turn her head
blanch by the fire said

why ar you here my lord deleroi i repeat
well if you would know master merchant i bring a paper for you or
rather a copi of it for the writ itself will be serv on you tomorrow
by the king offic it commit you to the tower under the royal
seal for trade with the king enemi a treason that can be prove
against you of which as you know or will shortli learn the punish
is death and as he spoke he threw a write down upon a side tabl
i see the plot i answer coldli the king unworthi favourit
forger and thief us the king author to try to bring the king
honest subject to bond and death by a fals accus it is a common
trick in these dai but let that be for the third time i ask youwhi
ar you here with my new wife and at thi hour of the night
so courteou a question demand a courteou answer master merchant
but to give it i must troubl you to listen to a tale
then let it be like my patienc brief i repli
it shall he said with a mock bow
then veri clearli and quietli he set out a dread stori give date
and circumst let that stori be the substanc of it wa that he
had marri blanch soon after she reach womanhood and that she had
born him a child which di
blanch i said when he had done you have heard is thi true
much of it is true she answer in that strang cold voic still
stare at the fire onli the marriag wa a fals on by which i
wa deceiv he who celebr it wa a companion of the lord deleroi
trick out as a priest
do not let us wrangl of thi matter said deleroi a man who mix
with the world like yourself master merchant will know that women in a
trap rare lack excus still if it be admit that thi marriag
did not fulfil all formal then so much the better for blanch
and myself if she be your law wife and not mine you i learn have
sign a write in her favour under which she will inherit your great
wealth that indentur i think you can find no opportun to disput
and if you do i have a promis that the properti of a certain traitor
shall pass to me the reveal of hi treacheri let it consol you in
your last moment master merchant to rememb that the ladi whom you
have honour with your fanci will pass her dai in wealth and comfort
in the compani of him whom she ha honour with her love
draw i said briefli as i unsheath my sword
why should i fight with a base trade usur he ask still
mock me though i thought that there wa doubt in hi voic
answer your own question thief fight if you will or die without
fight if you will not for know that until i am dead you do not leav
thi room live
until i dead too o lord broke in kari in hi gentl voic bow in
hi courteou foreign fashion
as he did so with a sudden motion kari shook the cloak back from hi
bodi and for the first time i saw that thrust through hi leathern belt
wa a long weapon half sword and half dagger also that it sharpen
steel wa bare
oh exclaim deleroi now i understand that i am trap and that
when you told me blanch that thi man would not return tonight and
that therefor we were safe togeth you li well my ladi blanch
you shall pai for thi trick later
whilst he spoke thu slowli as though to gain time he wa look
about him and as the last word left hi lip know that the door wa
lock he dash for the window hope i suppos to leap through the
casement or if that fail to shout for help but kari who had set
the candl he bore on a side tabl that where the write lai read
hi mind with a movement more swift than that of a polecat leap on
it prei the swiftest inde that ever i saw he sprang between him and
the casement so that deleroi scarc escap pin himself upon the
steel that he held in hi long outstretch arm inde i think it
prick hi throat for he check himself with an oath and drew
hi sword a doubleedg weapon with a sharp point as long as mine
perhap but not so heavi
i see that i must finish the pair of you perchanc blanch you will
protect my back as a love wife should do until thi lout is done
with he said swagger to the last
kari i command hold the candl aloft that the light mai be good
and leav thi man to me
kari bow and took the copper taper stand on in either hand and
held them aloft but first he place hi long dagger not back in hi
belt but between hi teeth with the handl toward hi right hand even
then in some strang fashion i note how terribl look thi grim dark
man hold the candl high with the knife grip between hi white
teeth
deleroi and i face each other in the open space between the fire and
the door blanch turn round upon her stool and watch utter no
sound but i laugh aloud for of the end i had no doubt had there been
ten deleroi i would have slain them all still present i found there
wa caus to doubt for when parri hi first thrust i drove at him
with all my strength instead of pierc him through and through the
ancient sword waveflam bent in my hand like a bow as it is strung
tell me that beneath hi joseph coat of silk deleroi wore a shirt
of mail
then i cri ahoi as thorgrimm my ancestor mai have done when
he wield thi same sword and while deleroi still stagger beneath
my thrust i grasp waveflam with both hand wheel it aloft and
smote he lift hi arm round which he had wound hi cloak to protect
hi head but the sword shore through cloak and arm so that hi hand
with the glitter ring upon it fell to the floor
again i smote for as both of us knew thi busi wa to the death
and deleroi fell down dead smitten through the brain
kari smile gentli and lift the cloak shook it out and threw it
over what had been deleroi then he took my sword and while i watch
him idli cleans it with rush from the floor
next i heard a sound from the neighbourhood of the fire and bethink
me of blanch turn to speak to her though what i wa go to sai god
know for i do not
a terribl sight met my ey and burn itself into my veri soul so that
it could never be forgot blanch wa lean back in the oak chair over
which flow her long fair lock and the front of her robe wa red i
rememb how she had spilt the wine at the feast and thought i saw it
stain till present still stare i note that it grew and knew it
to be caus by anoth wine that of her blood also i note that from
the midst of it seen in the lamplight just beneath the snakeencircl
rubi heart appear the littl handl of a dagger
i sprang to her but she lift her hand and wave me back
touch me not she whisper i am not fit also the thrust is mortal
if you draw the knife i shall die at onc and first i would speak i
would have you know that i love you and hope to be a good wife to you
what i said wa true that dead man trick me with a fals marriag
when i wa scarc more than a child and afterward he would not
mend it with an honest perchanc he himself wa wed or he had other
reason i do not know my father guess much but not all i tri
to warn you when you offer yourself but you were deaf and blind and
would not see or listen then i gave wai like you well and think
that i should find rest as inde i do think also that i should be
wealthi and abl to shut that villain mouth with gold i never knew
he wa come here or even that he had sail home from franc but he
broke in upon me have learn that you were awai and wa about to
leav when you return he came for monei for which he believ that
i had wed and think to win me back from on doom by hi li to a
traitor death you know the rest and for me there wa but on thing
to do be glad that you ar no longer burden with me and go find
happi in the arm of a more fortun or a better woman fly and

book ii
chapter i
the new world
thei were forev silent now who but a breath befor had been so full
of life and the stir of mortal passion deleroi dead beneath the cloak
upon the floor blanch dead in the oaken chair we who remain aliv
were silent also i glanc at kari face it wa as that of a stone
statu on a tomb onli in it hi larg ey shone note all thing
and as i imagin in my distraught fanci fill with triumph and
foreknowledg consid it in that strang calm of the spirit which
sometim superven on great and terribl event that for a while crush
it mortal from the soul and set it free to marvel at the tempor
petti of all we consid immedi and mighti i wonder what wa
the aspect of my own
at the moment i who on thi dai had pass the portal of so mani
emot that of the lover long for hi bride won at last onli to
be lost again that of acut and necessari busi that of the ancient
joi of battl and vengeanc wreak upon an evil man that of the
unshutt of my own ey to the flame of a hellish truth that of the
selfmurd and turn to cold clai befor those same ey of her whom
i had hope to clasp in honest lovei i sai felt as though i too
were dead inde all within wa dead onli the shell of flesh remain
aliv and in my heart i echo the word of my old uncl and of a wiser
than he who went befor himvan of vaniti all is vaniti
it wa kari who spoke first kari as ever calm and evenvo sai
in hi broken english of which but the substanc is record
thing have happen good thing i hold though you master mai think
otherwis for a littl while yet in thi rough land of savag and
small justic these thing mai bring troubl that lord brought a
write and he nod toward the document on the tabl and talk
of death for you masternot for himself and the ladi while she
still live she sayfli fly or die and now and he glanc at the
two bodi
i look at him vacantli for the numb follow the first shock wa
pass awai and all the eat agoni of my loss began to fix it fang
upon my heart
whither can i fly i ask and why should i fly i am an innoc
man and for the rest the sooner i am dead the better
my master must fly answer kari in swift broken word becaus he
still live and is free also sorrow behind joi befor kari who hate
women and read heart kari who drink thi same bitter water long ago
guess these thing come and think and think no need that master
troubl kari settl all and tell master that if he do what he sai
everyth come right
what am i to do i ask with a groan
ship blanch on great river readi for sea master and kari sail in
her befor daybreak here leav everyth much land much wealthwhat
matter life more than these thing which can get again come no on
minut wait
then he went to the bodi of deleroi and with wonder swift took
off it the chain coat he wore beneath hi tunic which he put on hi
own bodi also he took hi sword and buckl it about him while the
parchment writ he threw upon the fire then he extinguish the hang
lamp and gave me on of the candl take the other himself
at the door i held up my candl and by the light of it look my last
upon the ashen face of blanch which face i knew must go with me
through all my life dai
kari lock the stout oaken door of the solar from the outsid and took
me into my chamber where wa the armour of the knight whom i had kill
on hast hill which armour i had caus to be alter to fit myself
swiftli he buckl it on to me throw over all a long dark robe such
as merchant wear from the cupboard too he brought the big black bow
and a sheath of arrow also a purs of gold piec from where thei
were kept and with them the leathern bag which he had worn when i found
him on the quai
we went into the room where the feast had been held and there drank
some wine though eat i could not the cup from which i drank wa as it
chanc the same in which i had pledg blanch at the bride feast now
i pledg her spirit whereon i prai god merci
we left the hous and in the stabl saddl two hors strong quiet
beast then by wai of the back yard we rode out into the night none
see us for by now all were asleep and in that weather the street
were empti even of such as walk them in dark
we reach the quai i know not how long afterward whose mind wa
full of thought that blot out all els how strang had been my
lifethat wa on of them within a few year i had risen to great
wealth and won the woman i desir and now where wa the wealth and
where wa the woman and what wa i on fly hi nativ land by night
with blood upon hi hand the blood of a king favourit that if he
were taken would bring him to the noos oh how great wa the contrast
between the morn and the midnight of that dai for me vaniti of
vaniti all is vaniti
i think that my mind must have wander for when my soul wa swallow
in thi deepest pit of hell it seem to me that he whom i had
worship as a heavenli patron st hubert appear stride by my
hors with a shine counten and said to me
have good courag godson and rememb your mother wordsa wander
shall you be but whereer you go the good bow and the good sword shall
keep you safe and i wander with you nor doe all love die with on
woman pass breath
thi phantasi as it were lanc the abscess of my pain and for a
while i wa easier also someth of hope came back to me i no longer
desir to die but rather to live and in life not in the tomb to find
forget
we reach the quai and place the hors in a shed that serv as
stabl there rid them of their bit and saddl that thei might
eat of the hai in the rack the thought to do thi came to me which
show that my mind wa work again sinc still i could attend to the
want of other creatur then we went to the quaysid where wa made
fast that boat in which i had come ashor some hour gone there wa a
moon which now and again show between the drift cloud and by
the light of it i saw that the blanch lai safe at her anchor not a
bowshot awai the gale had fallen much with the rise of the moon
as it often doe and so it came about that although the boat wa
overlarg for two men to handl rightli kari and i by watch our
chanc were abl to row it to the ship on to which we climb by the
ladder
here we found a sailor on watch who wa amaz to see us and with hi
help made the boat fast by the tow rope to the stern of the ship
thi done i caus the captain to be awaken and told him briefli that
as the gale had abat and tide and wind serv i desir to sail
at onc he stare at me think me mad whom he knew to have been
marri but that dai
sure he said i should wait for the light and to gather up those of
the ship compani who were still ashor i answer that i would wait
for noth and when he ask why wa inspir to tell him that it wa
becaus i went about the king busi have letter from hi grace
to deliv to hi envoi in the south sea that brook of no delai
sinc on them hung peac or war
bewar i said to him how you or ani of you dare to disobei the
king order for you know that the fate of such is a short shrift and
a long rope
then that captain grew frighten and summon the sailor who by
now had slept off their drink and to them he told my command thei
murmur point to the sky but when thei saw me stand there
wear a knight armour and look veri stern with my hand upon my
sword when also through kari i promis them doubl pai for the voyag
thei too grew frighten and have set some small sail got up the
anchor
so it came about that within littl more than an hour of our board of
that ship she wa run out toward the sea as fast as tide and wind
could drive her i think that it wa not too soon for as the quai
vanish in the gloom i saw men with lantern move on it and thought
to myself that perhap an alarm had been given and thei were come to
take me
thi captain wa on who knew the river well and with the help of
anoth sailor he steer us down it reach safe by dawn we had
pass tilburi and at full light were off gravesend race for the open
sea now it wa that behind us we perceiv from the rush cloud that
the gale which had lull dure the night wa come up more strongli
than ever and still easterli the sailor grew afraid again and togeth
with the captain vow that it wa mad to face the sea in such
weather and that we must anchor or make the shore if we could
i refus to listen to them whereat thei seem to give wai
at that moment kari who had gone forward call to me i went to
him and he point out to me men gallop along the bank and wave
kerchief as though to signal to us to stop
i think master said kari that some have enter the sunroom at
your hous
i nod and watch the men who gallop and wave for some minut i
watch them till suddenli i saw that the ship wa alter her cours
so that her bow point first on wai and then anoth as though she
were no longer be steer we ran aft to learn the caus and found
thi
that crew of dastard everi man of them and the captain with them had
drawn up the boat in which kari and i came aboard that wa still ti
to the ship stern and slid down the rope into her purpos to
win ashor befor it wa too late kari smile as though he were not
astonish but in my rage i shout at them call them cur and
traitor i think that the captain heard my word for i saw him turn
hi head and look awai as though in shame but not the other thei were
engag in hunt for the oar onli to find them gone for it would
seem that thei had been wash or had fallen overboard
then thei tri to set some kind of sail by aid of a boathook but while
thei were do thi the boat which had drift side on to the great
wave rais by the gale upon the face of the broad river overturn i
saw some of the men cling to the boat and on or two scrambl on to
her keel but what chanc to them and the other i do not know who had
rush to the steer gear to set the ship upon her cours again
lest her fate should be that of the boat or we should go ashor and be
captur by those who gallop on the bank or be drown thi wa the
last i ever saw or heard of the crew of the blanch
the ship bow came round and driven by the everincreas gale she
rush on her cours toward the sea bear us with her two weak and
lone men
kari i said what shall we do try to run ashor or sail on
he thought awhil then answer point to those who gallop now but
tini figur on the distant bank
master yonder is death sure death and yonder here he point to
the sea is deathperhap master you have a god and i kari have
anoth god mayhap same god with differ name i saytrust our god
and sail on for god better than men if we die in water what matter
water softer than rope but i think not die
i nod for the reason seem good rather would i be drown than
fall into the hand of those who were gallop on the shore to be
drag back to london and a felon doom
so i press upon the tiller to bring the blanch more into
midchannel and head for the sea wider and wider grew the estuari
and farther and farther awai the shore as the blanch scud on
beneath her small sail with the weight of the gale behind her till at
last there wa the open sea
within a few feet of the tiller wa a deckhous in which the crew at
built of solid oak and clamp with iron here wa food in plenti al
too and with these we fill ourselv also leav kari to hold the
tiller i took off my armour and in place of it cloth myself in the
rough sea garment that lai about with tall greas boot and then sent
him to do likewis
soon we lost sight of land and were climb the great ocean billow
whose foami crest roll and spurt wherev the ey fell we could
set no cours but must go where the gale drove us awai awai we knew
not whither as i have said the blanch wa new and strong and the
best ship that ever i had sail in upon a heavi sea moreov her
hatch were close down for thi the sailor had done after we
weigh so she rode the water like a duck take no harm oh well
it wa for me that from my childhood i had had to do with ship and the
sail of them and fly from the follow wave thu wa abl to
steer and keep the blanch poop right in the wind which seem to
blow first from on quarter and then from that
now over my memori of these event there come a great confus and
sens of amaz all becam fragmentari and disjoint separ
also by what seem to be consider period of timedai or week
perhap there wa a sens of endless roar sea befor which the ship
fled on and on driven by a scream gale that i note dimli seem to
blow first from the northwest and then steadili from the east
i see myself veri distinctli lash the tiller to iron ring that
were screw in the deck beam and know that i did thi becaus i
wa too weak to hold it ani longer and desir to set it so that the
blanch should continu to drive straight befor the gale i see
myself ly in the deckhous of which i have spoken while kari fed me
with food and water and sometim thrust into my mouth littl pellet of
i knew not what which he took from the leathern bag he wore about him
i rememb that bag it had been on hi person when i rescu him at
the quai for i had seen it first as he wash himself afterward half
full of someth and wonder what it contain later i had seen it
in hi hand again when we left my hous after the death of blanch i
note that whenev he gave me on of these pellet i seem to grow
strong for a while and then to fall into sleep deep and prolong
after more daysor week i began to behold marvel and to hear strang
voic i thought that i wa talk with my mother and with my patron
st hubert also that blanch came to me and explain everyth
show how littl she had been to blame for all that had happen to me
and her these thing made me certain that i wa dead and i wa glad to
be dead sinc now i knew there would be no more pain or strive that
the endeavour which make up life from hour to hour had ceas and
that rest wa won onli then appear my uncl john grimmer who kept
quot hi favourit text at mevan of vaniti all is vaniti
he said ad did i not tell you that it wa thu year ago now you
have learn it for yourself onli nephew hubert dont think that you
have finish with vaniti yet as i have for i sai that there ar
plenti more to come for you
thu he seem to talk on about thi and other matter such as what
would happen to hi wealth and whether the hospit would be quick
to seiz the land to which he had given it the revers till i grew
quit tire of him and wish that he would go awai
then at length there wa a great crash that i think disturb him
for he did go sai that it wa onli anoth vaniti after which i
seem to fall asleep for week and week
i woke up again for a warmth and bright on my face caus me to open
my ey i lift my hand to shield them from the bright and note
with a kind of wonder that it wa so thin that the light shone through
it as it doe through parchment and that the bone were visibl beneath
the skin i let it fall from weak and it drop on to hair which i
knew must be that of a beard which set me wonder for it had been my
fashion to go cleanshaven how then did i come by a beard i look
about me and saw that i wa ly on the deck of a ship ye of the
blanch itself for i knew the shape of her stern also certain knot
in on of the upright of the deckhous that form a rude resembl
to a human face noth of thi deckhous wa left now except the
corner post between which i lai and to the top of these wa lash a
piec of canva as though to keep off the sun and the weather
with difficulti i lift my head a littl and look about me the
bulwark of the ship had gone but some of the upright to which
the plank had been nail remain and between them i perceiv
tallstem tree with tuft of great leav at the top of them which
tree seem to be within a few yard of me brightwing bird flew
about them and in their crown i saw ap such as the sailor us to
bring home from barbari it would seem then that i must be in a river
in fact it wa a littl bai or creek on either side of which these
tree appear
note these and the creep plant with beauti flower such as i
had never seen that climb up them and the sweet scent that float
on the air and the clear light now i grew sure that i wa dead and had
reach paradis onli then how came it that i still lai on the ship
for never had i heard that such thing also went to paradis nai
i must dream it wa noth but a dream that i wish were true
rememb as i did the terror of that galetoss sea or if i did
not dream then i wa in some new world
while i muse thu i heard a sound of soft footstep and present saw
a figur bend over me it wa kari veri thin and hollowei much
inde as he had been when i found him on the quai in london but still
kari without doubt he look at me in hi grave fashion then said
softli
master awak
ye kari i said but tell me where am i
he did not answer at onc but went awai and return present with
a bowl from which he bade me drink hold it to my lip i did
so swallow what seem to be broth though i thought it strang
flavour after which i felt much stronger for whatev wa in that
broth ran through my vein like wine at last he spoke in hi queer
english
master he said when we still in thame river you ask me whether we
should run ashor into the hand of the hunter who try to catch us
or sail on i answer you have god and i have god and better fall into
hand of god than into hand of men so we sail on into the big storm
for long we sail and though onc it turn alwai the great wind blew
behind us you grow weak and your mind leav you but i keep you aliv
with medicin that i have and for mani dai i stai awak and steer then
at last my mind leav me too and i know no more three dai ago i wake
up and find the ship in thi place then i eat more medicin and get
strength also food from peopl on the shore who think us god that all
the stori except that you live not die your god and my god bring us
here safe
ye kari but where ar we
master i think in that countri from which i come not in my own land
which is still far awai but still in that countri you rememb he
ad with a flash of hi dark ey i alwai sai that you and i go
there togeth on dai
but what is the countri kari
master not know it name it big and have mani name but you first
white man who ever come here that why peopl think you god now you go
sleep again tomorrow we talk
i shut my ey be so veri tire and as i learn afterward slept
for twelv hour or more to awak on the morn of the follow dai
feel wonderfulli stronger and abl to eat with appetit also kari
brought me water and wash me and clean cloth which he had found in
the ship that i put on
thu it went on for a long while and dai by dai i recov strength
till at length i wa almost as i had been when i marri blanch alei
in the church of st margaret at westminst onli now sorrow had
chang me within and without my face had grown more seriou while
to it hung a short yellow beard which when i look at my reflect
seem to becom me well enough that beard puzzl me much sinc
such ar not grown in a dai although it is true that as yet it wa not
overlong week must have pass sinc it began to sprout upon my chin
and as we had been but three dai in thi place when i woke up those
week without doubt were spent upon the sea
whither then had we come drive all the while befor a great gale
that for most of our voyag had blown from the east as if kari were
right we had done thi countri must be veri far awai from england
that it wa so inde there could be no doubt sinc here everyth
wa differ for exampl have been a marin from my childhood i
had been taught and observ someth of the star and note that the
constel had chang their place in the heaven also that
some with which i wa familiar were miss while other new on had
appear further the heat wa great and constant even at night
be more than that of our hottest summer dai and the air wa full of
sting insect which at first troubl me much though afterward
i grew harden to them in short everyth wa chang and i wa
inde in a new world that wa not told of in europ but what world
what world at least the sea join it to the old for beneath me wa
still the blanch which timber by timber i had seen built up upon the
shore of thame from oak cut in my own wood
as soon as i wa strong enough i went over the ship or what wa left
of her it wa a marvel that she had float for so long sinc her hull
wa shatter inde i do not think she could have done so save for
the fine wool that wa pack into the lower part of her which wool
seem to have swollen when it grew wet and to have kept the water out
for the rest she wa but a hulk sinc both her mast were gone and
much of the deck with them still she had kept afloat and drive into
thi creek had beach herself upon the mud as though it were the
harbour that she sought
how had we live through such a journei the answer seem to be after
we were too weak to find or take food by mean of the drug that kari
cherish in hi skin bag and water of which there wa plenti left at
hand in barrel sinc the blanch had been provis for a long
voyag to itali and farther at least we had live for week and week
be still young and veri strong and not have been call upon
to suffer great cold sinc it would appear that although the gale
continu after the first few dai of our flight befor it the weather
had turn warm
dure thi time of my recoveri everi morn kari would go ashor
which he did by mean of plank set upon the mud sinc we were within
a few feet of the bank of the creek into which a streamlet ran later
he would return bring with him fish and wildfowl and corn of a
sort that i did not know for it grain were a dozen time the size of
wheat flatsid and if ripe of a yellow colour which he said he
had purchas from those who dwelt upon the land on thi good food
i feast wash it down with al and wine from the ship store
inde never befor did i eat so much not even when i wa a boi
at length on morn kari made me put on my armour the same which i
had taken from the french knight and fled in from london that he had
burnish till it shone like silver and seat myself in a chair upon
what remain of the poop of the ship when i ask him why he answer
in order that he might show me to the inhabit of that land in thi
chair he bade me sit and wait hold the shield upon my arm and the
bare sword in my right hand
as i had come to know that kari never did anyth without a reason and
rememb that i wa in a strang countri where lack him i should
not have live or could continu to do so i fell into hi humour
moreov i promis that i would remain still and neither speak
nor smile nor rise from my chair unless he bade me so there i sat
glitter in the hot sunshin which burn me through the armour
then kari went ashor and wa absent for some time at length among the
tree and undergrowth i heard the sound of peopl talk in a strang
tongu present thei appear on the bank of the creek a great number
of them veri curiou peopl brownskin with long lank black hair
and larg ey but not overtal in statur men women and children
togeth
among them were some who wore white robe whom i took to be their
gentlefolk but the most of them had onli cloth or girdl about their
middl lead the throng wa kari who as it appear from the
bush wave hi hand and point me out seat in the shine armour
on the ship the visor up to show my face and the long sword in my hand
thei stare then with a low sigh exclam on and all fell
upon their face and rub their brow upon the ground
as thei lai there kari address them wave hi arm and point
toward me from time to time afterward i learn that he wa tell
them i wa a god for which lie mai hi soul be forgiven
the end of it wa that he bade them rise and led certain of them who
wore the white robe across the plank to the ship here while thei
hung back he advanc toward me bow and kiss the air till
he drew near then he went upon hi knee and laid hi hand upon my
steelclad feet more from the bosom of hi robe he drew out flower
which he place upon my knee as though in offer
now master he whisper to me rise and wave your sword and shout
aloud to show that you ar aliv and not an imag
so up i sprang circl waveflam about my head and roar like ani
bull of bashan for my voic wa alwai loud and carri far when
thei saw the bright sword whirl through the air and heard these
bellow utter cri of fear those poor folk fled inde most of
them fell from the plank into the mud where on stuck fast and wa like
to drown had not kari rescu him which hi brethren were in too great
hast to do
after thei had gone kari came and said that everyth went well and
that henceforward i wa not a man but the spirit of the sea come to
earth such a spirit as had never been dream of even by the wizard
thu then did hubert of hast becom a god among those simpl peopl
who had never befor so much as heard of a white man or seen armour or
a sword of steel
chapter ii
the rocki isl
for anoth week or more i remain upon the blanch wait till
my full strength return also becaus kari said i must do so when
i ask him why he repli for the reason that he wish new of my
come to spread far and wide throughout the land from on tribe to
anoth which it would do with great swift fly as he put it
like a bird meanwhil everi dai i sat upon the poop in the armour for
an hour or more and both these peopl and other from afar came to look
at me bring me present in such quantiti that we knew not what to do
with them inde thei built an altar and sacrif wild creatur to
me and bird burn them with fire both those that i had seen and
the other folk from a long wai off made thi offer
at last on night when have eaten kari and i were seat togeth
in the moonshin befor we slept i turn on him suddenli hope thu
to surpris the truth out of hi secret heart and said
what is your plan kari for know i weari of thi life
i wa wait for the master to ask that question he repli with
hi gentl smile again i give not the veri word he spoke in hi bad
english but the substanc of them now will the master be pleas to
listen as i have told the master i believ that the god hi god and
my god have brought me back to that part of the world which is unknown
to the master where i wa born i believ thi from the first hour
that my ey open on it after our swoon for i knew the tree and
the flower and the smell of the earth and saw that the star in the
heaven stood where i us to see them when i went ashor and mingl
with the nativ i discov that thi belief wa right sinc i could
understand someth of their talk and thei could understand someth
of mine moreov among them wa a man who came from far awai who said
that he had seen me in past year wander like on mad onli that
thi man whom he had seen wore the imag of a certain god about hi
neck whose name wa too high for him to mention then i open my robe
and show him that which i wear about my neck and he fell down and
worship it cry out that i wa the veri man
if so it is marvel i said but what shall we do
the master can do on of two thing he can stop here where these
simpl peopl will make him their king and give him wive and all that
he desir and so live out hi life sinc of return to the land whenc
he came there is no hope
and if there were i would not go i interrupt
or went on kari he can try to travel to my countri but that is
veri far awai someth of the journei which i made when i wa mad
come back and tell me that it is veri veri far awai first yonder
mountain must be cross till anoth sea is reach which is no
great journei though rough then the coast of that sea must be follow
southward for i know not how far but as i think for month or year
of journei till at length the countri of my peopl is reach
moreov that journei is hard and terribl sinc the road run
through forest and desert where dwell savag tribe and huge snake
and wild beast like those plant on the flag of your countri and
where famin and sick ar common therefor my counsel to the
master is that he should leav it unattempt
now i thought awhil and ask what he meant to do if i took thi
counsel of hi to which he repli
i shall wait here awhil till i see the master made a king among these
peopl and establish in hi rule then i shall start on that journei
alon hope that what i could do when i wa mad i shall be abl to do
again when i am not mad
i thought it i said but tell me kari if we were to make thi
journei and perchanc live to reach your peopl how would thei welcom
us
i do not know master but i think that of the master thei would make
a god as will all the other peopl of thi countri perhap too thei
will sacrific thi god that hi strength and beauti mai enter into
them as for me some of them will try to kill me and other will cling
to me who will conquer i do not know and to me it matter littl i
go to take my own and to be aveng and if in seek vengeanc i
diewel i die in honour
i understand i said and now kari let us start as soon as possibl
befor i becom as mad from stare at those tree and flower and those
bigei nativ that you sai would make me a king as you tell me you
were when you left your countri whether we shall ever find that countri
i cannot sai but at least we shall have done our best and if we fail
shall perish seek as in thi wai or in that it is the lot of all
brave men to do
the master ha spoken said kari even more quietli than usual though
as he spoke i saw hi dark ey flash and a trembl as of joi run down
hi bodi know all he ha made hi choic and whatev happen
be what it is he will not blame me yet becaus the master ha thu
chosen i sai thisthat if we reach my countri and if perchanc
i becom a king there even more than befor i shall be the master
servant
that is easi to promis now kari but it will be time to talk of it
when we do reach your land i said laugh and ask him when we
were to start
he repli not yet awhil as he must make plan and that in the
meantim i must walk upon the shore so that my leg might grow strong
again so there everi dai i walk in the cool of the morn and in the
even not go out of sight of the wreck i went arm and carri
my big bow but saw no on sinc the nativ had been warn that i
should walk and must not be look upon while i did so therefor even
when i pass through on of their villag of hut built of mud and
thatch with leav it seem to be desert
still in the end the bow did not come amiss for on even hear a
littl nois in a big tree under which i wa about to pass that remind
me of the pur of a cat i look up and saw a great beast of the
tiger sort ly on the bough of the tree and watch me then i drew
the bow and sent an arrow through that beast pierc it from side to
side and down it came roar and writh and bite at the arrow
till it di
after thi i return to the ship and told kari what had happen he
said it wa fortun i had kill the beast which wa of a veri fierc
kind and if i had not seen it would have leapt on me as i pass under
the tree also he sent nativ to skin it who when thei saw that it wa
pierc through and through by the arrow were amaz and thought me an
even greater god than befor their own bow be but feebl and their
arrow tip with bone
three dai after the kill of thi beast we start on our journei
into a land unknown for a long while befor kari and i had been engag
in collect all the knive we could find in the ship also arrow
nail ax tool of carpent cloth and i know not what els
besid which good we ti up in bundl wrap in sailcloth each
bundl weigh from thirti to forti pound to serv as present to
nativ or to trade awai with them when i ask who would carri them
kari answer that i should see thi i did at dawn on the follow
morn when there arriv upon the shore a great number of men quit
a hundr inde who brought with them two litter made of light wood
joint like reed onli harder in which kari said he and i were to be
carri among these men he parcel out the load which thei were to
bear upon their head and then said that it wa time for us to start in
the litter
so we start but first i went down into a cabin and kneel on my
knee thank god for have brought me safe so far and prai him
and st hubert to protect me on my further wander and if i di to
receiv my soul thi done i left the ship and while the nativ bow
themselv about me enter my litter which wa comfort enough
have grass mat to lie on and other mat for curtain veri fine
woven so that thei would turn even the heaviest rain
then awai we went eight men bear the pole to which each litter wa
slung on their shoulder while other carri the bundl upon their
head our road ran through forest uphil and on the crest of the first
hill i descend from the litter and look back
there in the creek below lai the wreck of the blanch now but a small
black blot show against the water and beyond it the great sea over
which we had travel yonder broken hulk wa the last link which bound
me to my distant home thousand of mile across the ocean that home
which my heart told me i should never see again for how could i win
back from a land that no white foot had ever trod
on the deck of thi ship blanch herself had stood and smile and
talk for onc we visit it togeth shortli befor our marriag and
i rememb how i had kiss her in it cabin now blanch wa dead
by her own hand and i the great london merchant wa an outcast among
savag in a countri of which i did not even know the name where
everyth wa new and differ and there the ship with her rich
cargo after bear us so brave through week of tempest must lie
until she rot in the sun and rain and never again would my ey
behold her oh then it wa that a sens of all my miseri and loneli
grip my heart as it had not done befor sinc i rode awai after
kill deleroi with the sword waveflam and i wonder why i had been
born and almost hope that soon i might die and go to seek the reason
back into the litter i crept and there hid my face and wept like a
child truli i the prosper merchant of london town who might have
live to becom it mayor and magistr and win nobil wa now an
outcast adventur of the humblest well so god had decre and there
wa no more to sai
that night we encamp upon a hilltop past which rush a river in the
vale below and were troubl with heat and insect that hum and bit
for to these as yet i wa not accustom and at of the food that we
had brought with us dri flesh and corn
next morn with the light we start on again up and down mountain
and through more forest follow the cours of the river and the
shore of a lake so it went on until on the third even from high
land we saw the sea beneath us a differ sea from that which we had
left for it seem that we had been cross an isthmu not so wide
but that if ani had the skill a canal might be cut across it join
those two great sea
now it wa that our real travel began for here after stare at the
star and brood apart for a long while kari turn southward with
thi i had noth to do who did not greatli care which wai he turn
nor did he speak to me of the matter except to sai that hi god and
such memori as remain to him through hi time of mad told him that
the land of hi peopl lai toward the south though veri far awai
so southward we went follow path through the forest with the
ocean on our right hand after a week of thi wearisom march we came
to anoth tribe of nativ of whose talk those with us could understand
enough to tell them our stori inde the rumour that a white god
had appear in the land out of the sea had alreadi reach them and
therefor thei were prepar to worship me here our peopl left us
sai that thei dare not go further from their own countri
the scene of the departur wa strang sinc everi on of them came and
rub hi forehead in the dust befor me and then went awai walk
backward and bow still their go did not make a great differ
to us sinc the new tribe wa much as the old on though if anyth
rather less cloth and more dirti also it accept me as a god without
question and gave us all the food we need moreov when we left
their land men were provid to carri the litter and the load
thu then pass from tribe to tribe we travel on southward ever
southward find alwai that the rumour of the come of the god
had gone befor us so gentl were all these peopl that not onc did
we meet with ani who tri to harm us or to steal our good or who
refus us the best of what thei had our adventur it is true were
mani thu twice we came to tribe that were at war with other tribe
though on my appear thei laid down their arm at ani rate for a
time and bore our litter forward
again sometim we met tribe who were cannib and then we suffer
much from want of meat sinc we dare not touch their food unless it
were grain in the town of the first of these cannib peopl be
move with furi i kill a man whom i found about to murder a child and
eat her sweep off hi head with my sword for thi deed i expect
that thei would murder us but thei did not thei onli shrug their
shoulder and sai that a god can do as he pleas took awai the
slain man and at him
sometim our road ran through terribl forest where the great tree
shut out the light of dai and a path must be hack through the
undergrowth sometim it wa haunt by tiger or tree lion such as i
have spoken of against which we must watch continu especi
at night keep the brute off by mean of fire sometim we were
forc to wade great river or wors still to walk over them on
swai bridg made of cabl of twist reed that until i grew
accustom to them caus my head to swim though never did i permit
myself to show fear befor the nativ again onc we came to swampi
land that were full of snake which terrifi me much especi after
i had seen some nativ whom thei bit die within a few minut
other snake there were also as thick as a man bodi and four or five
pace in length which live in tree and kill their food by coil
round it and press it to death these snake it wa said would take
men in thi fashion though i never saw on of them do so at ani rate
thei were terribl to look on and remind me of their forefath
through whose mouth satan talk with mother ev in the garden of eden
and thu brought us all to woe
onc too on the bank of a great river i saw such a snake that at
the sight of it my knee knock togeth by st hubert the beast wa
sixti feet or more in length it head wa of the big of a barrel
and it skin wa of all the colour of the rainbow moreov it seem
to hold me with it ey for till it slip awai into the river i
could not move a foot
month after month we travel thu cover a matter of perhap five
mile a dai sinc sometim the countri wa open and we cross it with
speed yet although our danger were so mani strang enough dure
all thi time even in that heat neither of us fell sick as i think
becaus of the herb which kari carri in hi bag that i found wa
name coca whereof we obtain more as we went and at from time to
time nor did we ever realli suffer from starvat sinc when we were
hungri we took more of thi herb which support us until we could
find food these merci i set down to the good offic of st hubert
watch from heaven over me hi poor namesak and godson though
perhap the skill and courag of kari which provid against everyth
had someth to do with them
at length in the ninth month of our travel as kari reckon it by
mean of knot which he ti on piec of nativ string for i had long
lost count of time we came to the border of a great desert that the
nativ said stretch southward for a hundr leagu and more and
wa without water moreov to the east of thi desert rose a chain
of mountain border by precipic up which no man could climb here
therefor it seem as though our journei must end sinc kari had no
knowledg of how he cross or went round thi desert in hi mad of
bygon year if inde he ever travel that road at all a matter of
which i wa not certain
for a week or more we remain among the tribe that live in a beauti
water vallei upon the border of thi desert wonder what we should
do for my part i wa by now so tire of travel upon an endless
quest that i should have been glad to stai among that tribe a veri
gentl and friendli peopl who like all the rest believ me to be a
god and make my home there till i di but thi wa not kari mind
which wa set fierc upon win back to hi own countri that he
believ to lie toward the south
dai by dai we sat there regain our strength upon the good food of
that vallei and stare first at the desert to the south then at the
precipic on our left hand and lastli at the ocean upon our right
now thi peopl i should sai drew their wealth from the sea as well as
from the land sinc thei were great fishermen and went out upon it in
rude boat or raft made of a wooden frame to which were lash blownup
skin and bundl of dri reed upon these boat frail as thei
seem such as further south were call balsa thei made consider
journei to distant island where thei caught vast quantiti of fish
some of which thei us to manur their land moreov besid the
oar thei rig a squar cotton sail upon the balsa which enabl
them to run befor the wind without labour steer the craft by mean
of a paddl at the stern
while we were there i observ that on the spring up of a wind from
the north although it wa of no great strength the balsa all came
to shore and were drawn up out of reach of the wave when i inquir
why through kari the answer given wa becaus the fish season wa
over sinc that wind from the north would blow for a long time without
chang and those who went out in it upon the sea might be driven
southward to return no more thei state inde that often thi had
happen to venturesom men who had vanish awai and been lost
if you wish to travel south there is a wai of do so i said to
kari
at the time he made no answer but on the follow dai ask me
suddenli if i dare attempt such a journei
why not i answer it is as easi to die in the water as on land and
i weari of journei through endless swamp and forest or of cross
torrent and climb mountain ridg
the end of it wa that for a knife and a few nail kari purchas the
largest balsa that these peopl had provis it with as much
dri fish corn and water in earthenwar jar as it would carri
togeth with ourselv and such of our remain good as we wish to
take with us then we announc that i the god who had come out of the
sea desir to return into the sea with himself my servant
so on a certain fine morn when the wind wa blow steadili but not
too strongli from the north we embark upon that balsa while the
simpl savag made obeis with wonder in their ey hoist the
squar canva and sail awai upon what i suppos wa on of the
maddest voyag ever made by man
although it wa so clumsi the balsa move through the water at a good
rate cover quit two leagu the hour i should sai befor that
strong and steadi wind soon the villag that we had left vanish then
the mountain behind it grew dim and in time vanish also and there
remain noth but the great wilder upon our left and the vast
sea around steer clear of the land so as to avoid sunken rock we
sail on all that dai and all the night that follow and when the
light came again perceiv that we were run past a coastlin that
wa back by high mountain on some of which lai snow by the second
even these mountain had becom tremend and between them i saw
vallei down which ran stream of water
thu we went on for three dai and night the wind from the north
blow all the while and the balsa take no hurt by the end of
which time i reckon that we had travel as far along the coast as we
had done in six month when we journei over land at which i rejoic
kari rejoic also becaus he said that the shape and great of the
mountain we were pass remind him of those of hi own countri to
which he believ that we were draw near
on the fourth morn howev our troubl began sinc the friendli
wind from the north grew steadili stronger till at length it rose to a
gale soon our littl rag of canva wa torn awai but still we rush
on befor the follow sea at a veri great speed
now i thought of try to make the land but found that we could not do
so with the oar becaus of the current that set out toward the ocean
against which it wa imposs to urg our clumsi craft therefor we
must content ourselv with try to keep her head straight with the
steer oar but even then we were often whirl round and round
about two hour after noon the sky cloud over and there burst upon us
a great thunderstorm with torrent of rain also the wind grew stronger
and stronger
now we could no longer steer or do anyth except lie flat upon
the bottom of the balsa grip the cord with which it wa ti
togeth to save ourselv from be wash overboard sinc often
the foam crest of the wave broke upon us inde it wa marvel
that thi frail craft should hang togeth at all but ow to the
light of the reed and the blownup skin that were ti in them
still she float and whirl round and round sped upon her southward
path yet i knew that thi could not endur for veri long and commit
my soul to god as well as i wa abl in my halfdrown state wish
that my miseri were end
the dark came down but still the thunder roar and the lightn
blaze and by the flare of it i caught sight of snowcap mountain
far awai upon the coast also of kari cling to the reed of the
balsa at my side and from time to time kiss the golden imag of
pachacamac which hung about hi neck present he set hi lip against
my ear and shout
be bold our god ar still with us in storm
ye i answer and soon we shall be with our godsin peac
after thi i heard no more of him and fell to think with such wit
as were left to me of how mani peril we had pass sinc we saw the
shore of thame and that it seem sad that all should have been for
noth sinc it would have been better to die at the begin than
now at the end after so much miseri then the glare of the lightn
shone upon the handl of the sword waveflam which wa still strap
about me and i rememb the rune written upon it which my mother had
render to me upon the morn of the fight against the frenchmen how
did it run
he who lift waveflam on high
in love shall live and in battl die
stormtoss oer wide sea shall roam
and in strang land shall make hi home
conquer conquer shall he be
and far awai shall sleep with me
it fit well though of the love i had known littl and that most
unhappi and the battl in which i must die wa on with water also
i had conquer noth who myself wa conquer by fate in short the
thing could be read two wai like all propheci and onli on line of
it wa true beyond a doubtnam that waveflam and i should sleep
togeth
awhil later the lightn shone awesom like to the sword of a
whole armi of destroi angel so that the sky becam aliv with fire
in it light for an instant i saw ahead of us great breaker and beyond
them what look like a dark mass of land now we were in them for
the first of those hungri curl wave got a hold of the balsa and
toss it up dizzili then flung it down into a deep vallei of water
anoth came and anoth till my sens reel and went i cri to
st hubert but he wa a land saint and could not help me so i cri to
anoth greater than he
my last vision wa of myself ride a huge breaker as though it were a
hors then there came a crash and dark
lo it seem to me as though on were call me back from the depth
of sleep with troubl i open my ey onli to shut them again becaus
of the glare of the light then after a while i sat up which gave me
pain for i felt as if i had been beaten all over and look onc more
abov me shone the sun in a sky of deepest blue befor me wa the sea
almost calm while around were rock and sand among which crawl great
reptil that i knew for turtl as i had seen mani of them in our
wander moreov kneel at my side with the sword that he had
taken from the bodi of deleroi still strap about him wa kari
who bled from some wound and wa almost white with encrust salt but
otherwis seem unharm i stare at him unabl to open my mouth from
amaz so it wa he who spoke the first sai in a voic that had
a note of triumph in it
did i not tell you that the god were with us where is your faith
o white man look thei have brought me back to the land of which i am
princ
now there wa that in kari tone which in my weak state anger me
why did he scold me about faith why did he address me as white man
instead of master wa it becaus he had reach a countri where he
wa great and i wa noth i suppos so and answer
and ar these your subject o nobl kari and i point to the
crawl turtl and is thi the rich and wondrou land where gold and
silver ar as mud and i point to the barren rock and sand around
he smile at my jest and answer more humbl
nai master yonder is my land
then i look follow hi glanc and saw mani leagu wai across the
water two snowclad peak rise abov a bank of cloud
i know those mountain he went on without doubt thei ar on of the
gatewai of my land
then we might as well be in london for all the hope we have of pass
that gate kari but tell me what ha chanc
thi i think a veri great wave caught us and threw us right over
those rock on to the shore lookther is the balsa and he point
to a broken heap of reed and pierc skin
with hi help i rose and went to it now none could know that it had
been a boat still the balsa it wa and noth els and ti in it
tangl mass still remain those thing which we had brought with us
such as my black bow and armour though all the jar were broken
it ha born us well but will never bear us again i said
that is so master but if we were in my own countri yonder i would set
it fragment in a case of gold and place them in the templ of the sun
as a memori
then we went to a pool of rainwat that lai in a hollow rock near by
and drank our fill for we were veri thirsti also among the ruin of
the balsa we found some of the dri fish that wa left to us and
have wash it fill ourselv after thi we limp to the crest of
the land behind and perceiv that we were on a littl island perhap
two hundr english acr in extent whereon noth grew except some
coars grass thi island howev wa the haunt of great number of
seafowl which nest there also of the turtl that i have mention
and of certain beast like seal or otter
at least we shall not starv i said though in the dry season we mai
die of thirst
now there on that island we remain for four long month for food we
at the turtl which we cook over fire that kari made by cunningli
twirl a point piec of driftwood in the hollow of anoth piec
that he fill with the dust of dri grass had he lack that
knowledg we must have starv or live on raw flesh as it wa we had
plenti with thi meat and that of bird and their egg also of fish
that we caught in the pool when the tide wa down from the shell of
the turtl by the help of stone we built us a kind of hut to
keep off the sun and the rain which in that hot place wa suffici
shelter also when the stench wa out of them we us other shell in
which to catch rainwat that we store as best we could against season
of drought lastli with my big bow which wa save with the armour i
shot seaotter and from their pelt we made us garment after rub
the skin with turtl fat and handl them to make them soft
thu then we live from moon to moon upon that desert place till i
thought i should go mad with loneli and despair for no help came
near us there were the mountain of the mainland far awai but between
them and us stretch leagu of sea that we could not swim nor had we
anyth of which to make a boat
here we must remain until we die at last i cri in my wretched
nai answer kari our god ar still with us and will save us in
their season
thi inde thei did in a strang fashion
chapter iii
the daughter of the moon
for the fourth time sinc we were cast awai on thi island the huge full
moon shone in a sky of wondrou blue kari and i watch it rise between
the two snowclad peak far awai that he had call a gatewai to hi
land which wa so near to us and yet it would seem more distant than
heaven itself heaven we might hope to reach upon the wing of spirit
when we di but to that countri how could we come
we watch that great moon climb higher and higher up a ladder of littl
barlik cloud till weari we let our ey fall upon the glitter
pathwai which it light made upon the bosom of the placid sea suddenli
kari stare and stare
what is it i ask idli
i thought i saw someth yonder far awai where quilla footstep make
the water bright he said speak in hi own languag in which now
we often talk togeth
quilla i exclaim oh i forgot that is the ladi moon name in
your tongu is it not well come quilla and i will wed and worship
you as ti said the ancient did and never turn to look upon anoth
be she woman or goddess or both onli come and take me from thi
accurs isl and in payment ill die for you if need be when first
iv taught you how to love as star or woman never love befor
hush said kari in a grave voic when he had listen to thi mad
stuff that burst through my lip from the spring of a mind distraught by
miseri and despair
why should i hush i ask is it not pleasant to think of the moon
wear a love woman shape and descend to give a lone mortal
love and comfort
becaus master to me and my peopl the moon is a goddess who hear
prayer and answer it suppos then that she heard you and answer
you and came to you and claim your love what then
why then friend kari i rave on then i should welcom her for
love goe a beg readi as ripe fruit to be pluck by the first hand
if it be fair enough readi to melt beneath the first lip if thei be
warm enough ti said that it is the man who love and the woman who
accept the love but that is not true it is the man kari who wait
to be love and pai back just as much as is given to him and no more
like an honest merchant for if he doe otherwis then he suffer for
it as i have learn therefor come quilla and love as a celesti
can and i swear that step by step ill keep pace with you in flesh
and spirit through heaven or through hell sinc love i must have or
death
i prai you talk not so said kari again in a frighten voic
sinc those word of your come from the heart and will be heard the
goddess is a woman too and what woman will turn from such a bait
let her take it then why not
becaus o friend becaus quilla is wed to yuti the moon is the
sun wife and if the sun grow jealou what will happen to the man who
ha rob the greatest of the world god
i do not know and i do not care if quilla would but come and love me
id take my chanc of yuti whom as a christian i defi
kari shudder at thi blasphemi then have onc more scan that
silver pathwai on the water but without avail for the great fish
or drift tree or whatev he had seen wa gone prai after hi
fashion at night to pachacamac spirit of the univers or to the sun
hi servant god of the world i know not which and roll himself in
hi rug of skin crept into our littl hut to sleep
but as yet i did not sleep for though kari hate both thi talk of
love and women had stir my blood and made me wake so i took a
rough comb that i had fashion from the shell of a turtl and drag
it through my long fair beard which grow fast now hung down far
upon my breast and through the curl hair that lai upon my shoulder
for i had becom as other wild men ar and sang to myself there by the
littl fire which we kept burn dai and night and tri to think of
happi thing that never should i know again
at length the fit pass and i grew weari and laid myself down by the
fire for the night be so fine and warm i would not go into the hut
and there sleep found me
i dream in my sleep i dream that a veri beauti woman who wore
upon her nake breast the emblem of the moon fashion in crystal stood
over me look down upon me with larg dark ey and as she look
she sigh thrice she sigh each time more deepli than the last then
she knelt down by meor so it seem in my dream and laid a tress of
her long dark hair against my yellow lock as though she would match
them togeth she did more indeedin my dreamfor lift that tress
of fragrant hair she let it fall like thistledown across my face and
mouth and then kiss the hair for i felt her breath reach me through
it strand
the dream end thu though i wish veri much that it would go on and
i felt as though it had gone awai as such vision do awhil later as i
suppos i awok quit suddenli and open my ey there near to me
glitter in the full light of the brilliant moon stood the woman of
my dream onli now her nake breast wa cover with a splendid cloak
broider with silver and on her dark lock wa a feather headdress
in front of which rose the crescent of the moon likewis fashion in
silver also in her hand she held a littl silver spear
i stare at her for move i could not then rememb my crazi talk
with kari utter on word onli on it wasquilla
she bow her head and answer in a voic soft as the murmur of the
wind through rush speak in the rich languag call quichua that
kari had taught me in thi tongu as i have told we talk togeth
for practic dure our journei and on the island so that now i knew
it well
so inde am i name after my mother the moon she said but how
did you know it o wander whose skin is white as the foam of the sea
and whose hair is yellow as the fine gold in the templ
i think you must have told me when you knelt over me just now i said
i saw the red blood run to her brow but she onli shook her head and
answer
nai my mother the moon must have told you or perchanc you learn
it in the spirit at least quilla am i name and you call me aright
now i stood up and stare at her overcom by the strang of the
busi and she stare at me a marvel beauti woman she wa
in her dazzl robe and headdress and lighter colour than ani nativ
i had seen almost white inde in the moonlight save for the copper
ting that mark her race tall too yet not overtal slim and
straight as an arrow but highbreast and roundlimb and with a
wild grace in her movement like to that of a hawk upon the wing also
to my fanci in her face there wa someth more than common youth
beauti someth spiritu such as great artist show upon the carven
counten of saint
inde she might well have been on whose human blood wa mix with
some other alien straina she had call herself a daughter of the
moon
a question rose to my lip and burst from them it wa
tell me o quilla ar you wife or maid
maid am i she answer yet on who is promis as a wife and she
sigh then went on quickli as though thi matter were someth of
which she did not wish to talk and tell me o wander ar you god or
man
now i grew cun and answer
i am a son of the sea as you ar a daughter of the moon
she turn her head and glanc at the radianc which lai upon the face
of the deep then said as though to herself
the moon shine upon the sea and the sea mirror back the moon yet
thei ar far apart and never mai draw near
not so o quilla out of the sea doe the moon rise and her cours
run into the sea white arm she sink to sleep at last
again the red blood ran to her brow and her great ey fell those ey
of which never befor had i seen the like
it seem that thei speak our tongu in the sea and prettili she
murmur ad but is it not from and into heaven that the moon
rise and depart
at that moment to my grief our talk came to an end for out of the
hut crept kari he rose to hi feet and stood there as ever calm and
dignifi look first at quilla and then at me
what did i tell you master he said in english did i not sai that
prayer such as your ar answer lo here is that child of the moon
for whom you sought cloth in beauti and bring her gift of love
and woe
ye i exclaim and i am glad that she is here for the rest were
she but mine i think i should not grudg her price whateer it be
quilla look at kari frown over the spear that when he appear she
had lift as though to defend herself which in my case she had not
thought need
so the sea breed men of my own race also she said address him
tell me o stranger how did you and yonder white god come to thi
isl
ride on the ocean billow ride for thousand of leagu he
answer and you o ladi how did you come to thi isl
ride on the moonbeam she repli smile i the daughter of the
moon who am name moon and wear her symbol on my brow
did i not tell you so exclaim kari to me with a gloomi air
then quilla went on
stranger i wa out fish with two of my maiden and we had drift
far from land as the sun sank i caught sight of the smoke of your fire
and have been told that thi isl wa desert my heart drew me to
discov who had lit it so though my maiden were afraid hither

into the sea or to accompani me back to the town of quismancu if so

light step of a deer

it on becaus he declar that thu it would be more easili carri
though i think he had other reason in hi mind

moonladi for a pilot he repli heavili had the sun been up it

i will rememb kari
that is not enoughswear it
good i swear itbi the moon
nai not by the moon for the moon is woman and chang swear it by
thi and from beneath hi skin robe he drew out the golden imag of
pachacamac swear it by the spirit of the univers of whom sun and
moon and star ar but servant the spirit whom all men worship in thi
shape or in that
so to pleas him i laid my hand upon the golden symbol and swore then
veri hurriedli we made up a tale of how clad in my armour i had risen
from the sea and found him on the island and how know me for a white
god who onc in ag past had visit that land and who as propheci
foretold should return to it in dai to come he had worship me and
becom my slave
thi done we went down to the rock kari walk after me and bear
all our small possess and with them deleroi sword pass round
the rock we saw the balsa drawn up to the sand and by it the ladi
quilla who now had put off her fine robe and again wa attir as a
fishinggirl as i had seen her in my dream and with her two tall girl
in the same scanti garment when these saw me in the glitter armour
which in our long idl hour we had polish till it shone like silver
with the shield upon my arm and the casqu upon my head and the great
sword gird about my middl and the black bow in my hand thei scream
with fear and fell upon their face while even quilla start back and
glanc toward the boat
fear not i said the god ar kind to those who do them servic
though to those who would harm them thei ar terribl
kari also went to them and whisper in their ear what tale i know not
in the end thei rose trembl and have motion to me to be seat
in it with the help of kari push the balsa which i note with joi
wa larg and well made down into the sea then on by on thei climb
in quilla take the steeringoar while kari and the two maiden
hoist the littl sail and paddl till we were clear of the island
where the gentl wind caught the balsa then thei ship the paddl
and although full laden we sail quietli toward the mainland
now i wa at the bow of the balsa and quilla wa at it stern and
between us were the other so that dure all that long night journei
i had no speech with her and must content myself with gaze over my
shoulder at her beauti as best i could which wa not well becaus of
kari who ever seem to come between my ey and her
thu the long hour went by till at length when we were near the land
the moon sank and we sail on through the twilight then came the
dawn and there in front of us we saw the love strand green with palm
within a ring of snowclad mountain two of them the great peak that
we had seen from our isl
on the shore wa a citi of white flatroof hous and rise abov
it perchanc the half of a mile from the sea a hill four or five
hundr feet in height and terrac on the top of the hill stood a
mighti build paint red that from the look of it i took to be on
of the church of these peopl in the centr of which gleam great
door that as i found afterward were cover with plate of gold
behold the templ of pachacamac master whisper kari bow hi
head and kiss the air in token of rever
by thi time watchmen who had been set there to search the sea or the
boat of quilla had note our approach thei shout and point to me
who sat in the prow clad in my armour upon which the sun glitter then
began to run to and fro as though in fear or excit so that er we
reach the shore a great crowd had gather meanwhil quilla had put
on her silverbroid mantl and her headdress of feather crown
with the crescent of the moon as we touch the beach she came forward
and for the first time dure that night spoke to me sai
remain here in the balsa lord while i talk with these peopl and
when i summon you be pleas to come fear notnon will harm you
then she sprang from the prow of the balsa to the shore follow by
her two maiden who drag it further up the beach and went forward
to talk with certain whiterob men in the crowd for a long while
she talk turn now and again to point at me at length these men
accompani by a number of other ran forward at first i thought thei
meant mischief and grasp my swordhilt then rememb what quilla
had said remain seat and silent
inde there wa no caus for fear for when the whiterob chief or
priest and their follow were close to me suddenli thei prostrat
themselv and beat their head upon the sand from which i learn that
thei too believ me to be a god thereon i bow to them and draw
my swordat the sight of which i saw them stare and shiver for to
these peopl steel wa unknownheld it straight up in front of me in my
right hand the shield with the cogniz of the three arrow be on
my left arm
now all the men rose and some of them of the humbler sort creep
to the balsa suddenli seiz it and lift it on to their shoulder
which be but a light thing of reed and blownout skin thei could
do easili enough then preced by the chief thei advanc up the
beach into the town i still remain seat in the boat with kari
crouch behind me so strang wa the busi that almost i laugh
aloud wonder what those grave merchant of the cheap whom i had
known in london would think if thei could see me thu
kari i said without turn my head what ar thei go to do with
us set us in yonder templ to be worship with noth to eat
i think not master answer kari sinc there the ladi quilla could
not come to speak with you if she would i think that thei will take
you to the hous of the king of thi countri where i understand she is
dwell
thi inde prove to be the case for we were born solemnli up the
main street of the town that now wa pack with thousand of peopl
some of whom threw flower befor the feet of the bearer bow and
stare till i thought that their ey would fall out to a larg
flatroof hous set in a wall courtyard pass through the gate
the bearer place the balsa on the ground and fell back then from
out of the door of the hous appear quilla accompani by a tall
state look man who wore a fine robe and a woman of middl ag also
gorgeous apparel
o lord said quilla bow behold my kinsman the caraca which
is the name for a lesser sort of king of the yunca name quismancu
and hi wife mira
hail lord risen from the sea cri quismancu hail white god
cloth in silver hail hurachi
why he call me hurachi at the time i could not guess but afterward
i learn that it wa becaus of the arrow paint on my shield
hurachi be their name for arrow at ani rate thenceforth by thi
name of hurachi i wa known throughout the land though when address
for the most part i wa call lordfromthesea or godofthesea
then quilla and the ladi mira came forward and place their hand
beneath my elbow assist me to climb out of that balsa which i
think wa the strangest wai that ever a shipwreck wander came to
land
thei led me into a larg room with a flat roof that wa be hastili
prepar for me by the hang of beauti broideri on the wall
and sat me on a carven stool where present quilla and other ladi
brought me food and a kind of intox drink which thei call
chicha that after so mani month of water drink i found cheer
and pleasant to the tast thi food i note wa serv to me on
platter of gold and silver and the cup also were of gold strang
fashion by which i knew that i had come to a veri rich land
afterward i learn howev that in it there wa no monei all the
gold and silver that it produc be us for ornament or to decor
the templ and the palac of the inca as thei call their king
and other great lord
chapter iv
the oracl of rimac
in thi town of quismancu i remain for seven dai go abroad but
littl for when i did so the peopl press about me and stare me out
of counten there wa a garden at the back of the hose surround
by a wall built of mud brick here for the most part i sat and here the
great on of the place came to visit me bring me offer of robe
and golden vessel and i know not what besid to all of them i told
the same storyor rather kari told it for menam that i had
risen out of the sea and found him a hermit name zapana on the desert
island what is more thei believ it and inde it wa true for had
i not risen out of the sea
from time to time quilla came to see me also in thi garden bear
gift of flower and with her i talk alon she would sit upon a
low stool consid me with her beauti ey as though she would
search out my soul on dai she said to me
tell me lord ar you a god or a man
what is a god i ask
a god is that which is ador and love
and is a man never ador and love quilla for instanc i understand
that you ar to be marri and doubtless you ador and love him who
will be your husband
she shiver a littl and answer
it is not so i hate him
then why ar you go to marri him ar you forc to do so quilla
no lord i marri him for my peopl sake he desir me for my
inherit and my beauti and by my beauti i mai lead him down that
road on which my peopl wish that he should go
an old stori quilla but will you be happi thu
no lord i shall be veri unhappi but what doe it matter i am onli a
woman and such is the lot of women
women like god and men ar also sometim love and ador quilla
she flush at the word and answer
ah if that were so life might be differ but even if it were so and
i found the man who could love and ador even for a year for me it is
now too late i am sworn awai by an oath that mai not be broken for to
break it might bring death upon my peopl
to whom ar you sworn

all thi land
and what is thi god like
thei sai that he is huge and swarthi with a larg mouth and i know
that he ha the heart of a brute he is cruel and fals also and he
count hi women by the score yet hi father the inca love him more
than ani of hi children and er long he will be king after him
and would you who ar sweet and love as the moon after which you ar
name give yourself bodi and soul to such a on
again she flush
do my own ear hear the whitegodfromthesea call me sweet and love
as the moon if so i thank him and prai him to rememb that the
perfect and love ar alwai chosen to be the sacrific of god
but quilla the sacrific mai be all in vain how long will you hold
the fanci of thi looseliv princ
long enough to serv my purpos lordor at least she ad with
flash ey long enough to kill him if he will not go my countri
road oh ask me no more for your word stir someth in my breast
a new spirit of which i never dream had i heard them but three moon
gone it might have been otherwis why did you not appear sooner from
the sea my lord hurachi be you god or man
then with someth like a sob she rose made obeis and fled
awai
that even when we were alon in my chamber where none could hear us
i told kari that quilla wa promis in marriag to a princ who would
be inca of all the land
is it so said kari well learn master that thi princ is my
brother he whom i hate he who ha done me bitter wrong he who stole
awai my wife and poison me urco is hi name doe thi ladi quilla
love him
i think not i think that like you she hate him yet will marri him
for reason of polici
doubtless she hate him now whatev she did a week ago said kari in
a dry voic but what fruit will thi tree bear master ar you mind
to come with me tomorrow to visit the templ of pachacamac in the inner
sanctuari of which sit the god rimac who speak oracl
for what purpos kari i answer moodili
that we mai hear oracl master i think that if you choos to go the
ladi quilla would come with us sinc perhap she would like also to
hear oracl
i will go if it can be done in secret sai at night for i weari of
be stare at by these peopl
thi i said becaus i desir to learn of the religion of thi nation
and to see new thing
perhap it can be so order master i will ask of the matter
it seem that kari did ask perhap of the high priest of pachacamac
for between all the worshipp of thi god there wa a brotherhood
perhap of the lord quismancu or perhap of quilla herselfi do not
know at least on thi same dai quismancu inquir whether it would
pleas me to visit the templ that night and so the matter wa settl
accordingli after the dark had fallen two litter were brought
into which we enter quilla and a wait woman seat themselv in
on of them and kari and i in the other for quismancu and hi wife did
not comewhi i cannot sai then preced by anoth litter in which
wa a priest of the god and surround by a guard of soldier through
a rainstorm we were born up the hillit wa but a littl wayto the
templ
here befor the golden door on which the lightn glimmer fitfulli
we descend and were led by whiterob men bear lantern through
variou court to the inner sanctuari of the god on the threshold of
which i cross myself not love the compani of heathen idol so far
as i could see by the lamplight it wa a great and gloriou place and
everywher that the ey fell wa goldplac of gold on the wall
offer of gold upon the floor star of gold upon the roof the
strang thing about thi holi place howev wa that it seem to be
quit empti except for the aforesaid gold there wa neither altar nor
imagenoth but a lamplit void
here all prostrat themselv save i alon and prai in silenc
when thei rose again in a whisper i ask of kari where wa the god
to which he answer nowher yet everywher thi i thought a true
sai and inde so solemn wa that place that i felt as though i were
surround by that which is divin
after a while the priest who were gorgeous apparel led us across
the sanctuari to a door that open upon some stair down these stair
we went into a long passag that seem to run beneath the earth for
the air in it wa heavi when we had walk a hundr pace or more
in thi narrow place we came to other step and anoth door pass
through which we found ourselv in a second templ smaller than that
which we had visit but like to it rich with gold in the centr of
thi templ sat the imag of a man rude fashion of gold
behold rimac the speaker whisper kari
how can gold speak i ask
kari made no answer
present the priest began to mutter prayer and incant that i
thought unholi after which thei laid offer of what look like
raw flesh set in cup of gold befor the idol that i thought unholi
still lastli thei drew back and ask of what we would learn
i made no answer who did not like the busi nor did kari sai
anyth but quilla spoke out boldli sai that we would learn of the
futur and what would befal us
now there wa a long silenc and i confess that fear got hold of me
for it seem to me as though spirit were move in the air and through
the dark behind usy as though i could hear their whisper
and the rustl of their wing suddenli at the end of thi silenc the
golden imag in front of us began to glow as though it were molten and
the emerald ey that were set in it head to sparkl terribl which
frighten me so much that had it not been for shame sake i would have
run awai but becaus of thi stood still and prai to st hubert
to protect me from the devil and hi work present i prai still
harder for the imag began to speaky in a horrid whistl voic
it spoke although no on wa near to it these were the word it said
who is thi clad in silver whose skin is white and whose hair is
yellow such an on i have not seen for a thousand year and such as he
it is that shall possess themselv of the land of tavantinsuyu shall
steal it wealth shall slai it peopl and shall cast down it god
but not yet not yet therefor thi is the command of pachacamac
utter by the voic of rimac the speaker that none do harm to or cross
the will of thi mighti seaborn lord sinc he shall be as a strong wall
to mani and hi sword shall be red with the blood of the wick
the whistl voic ceas while the priest and all there stare at
me for thei seem to think it word fate then suddenli it began
again
and who is thi that came out of the sea with the shine on have
wander further than ani of hi ancient blood i know i know yet i
mai not sai sinc the spirit of spirit whose imag he wear upon hi
heart bid me be silent be bold be bold prosper and grow great child
of pachacamac for thy wander ar not yet done still there is
a mountain to be climb and on the crest of it hang a fring of
heaven gold
again the voic ceas while thi time all stare at kari who shook
hi head humbl as though bewild by what he could not understand
onc more the imag spoke
who is thi daughter of the sun in whose vein plai moonbeam and who
is fairer than the even star on i think whom men shall desir and
becaus of whom shall flow the blood of the great on whose thought
is swift as the lightn and subtl as the snake on in whom passion
burn like fire in the womb of the mountain but who is fill with
spirit that danc abov the fire and who long for thing that ar
afar daughter of the sun in whose blood run the moonbeam thou shalt
slip from the hate arm and the sun shall be thy shelter and in the
belov arm thou shalt sleep at last yet from the vengeanc of the god
betrai fly fast and far
again the voic ceas and i thought that all wa over but it wa not
so for after a littl space the golden figur of the oracl glow more
fierc than befor and the emerald ey shone more terribl and in a
kind of scream it spoke sai
the snow of tavantinsuyu shall be red with blood the water of her
river shall be full of blood ye ye three shall wade through blood
and in a rain of blood shall pluck the fruit of your desir still for
a while the god of tavantinsuyu shall endur and it king shall reign
and it children shall be free but in the end death for the god and
death for the king and death for the peopl still not yetnot yet
none who live shall see it nor their children nor their children
children rimac the voic ha spoken treasur ye hi word and
interpret them as ye will
the whistl voic di awai like the thin cry of some starv child
in a desert and there wa a great silenc then in a moment the figur
of gold ceas to glow and the ey of emerald to burn leav the
thing but a dead lump of metal the priest prostrat themselv and
rise led us from the place without a word but in the light of the
lamp i saw that their face were full of terrorso full that i doubt
whether it could be feign
as we had come so we went and at last found ourselv outsid the
glitter templ door where the litter await us
what did it mean i whisper to quilla who wa by my side
for you and the other i know not she answer hurriedli but for
me i think that it mean death yet not untilnot until and she
ceas
at that moment the moon appear from behind the raincloud and shone
upon her upturn face and in her ey there wa a glori
now as i learn afterward these word of it most famou oracl went
all through the land and caus great talk and wonder mix with fear
for none of such import had been spoken by it for gener more
thei shape my own fortun for as i came to know quismancu and hi
peopl had determin that i should not be allow to go from among
them not everi dai did a white god rise from the sea and thei desir
that have come to them there he should bide to be their defenc and
boast and with him that hermit name zapana to whom as thei believ
he had appear upon the desert isl but after rimac had spoken all
thi wa chang and when i said it wa my will to depart and accompani
quilla upon her journei home to her father huaracha king of the
chanca as by swift messeng thi king invit me to do quismancu
answer that if i so desir i must be obei as the god rimac had
command but that nevertheless he wa sure that we should meet again
now think these thing over i wonder much whether that oracl
came out of the golden rimac or perchanc from the heart of quilla or
of kari or of both of them who desir that i should leav the yunca
and travel to the chanca and further i did not know nor wa i ever
to learn sinc about matter to do with their god these peopl ar as
secret as the grave i ask kari and i ask quilla but both of them
stare at me with innoc ey and repli who were thei to inspir
the golden tongu of rimac nor inde did i ever learn whether rimac
the speaker wa a spirit or but a lump of metal through which some
priest talk all i know is that from on end of tavantinsuyu to the
other he wa believ to be a spirit who spoke the veri will of god to
those who could understand hi word though thi as a christian man i
could not credit
so it came about that some dai later with quilla and kari and certain
old men who i took it were priest or ambassador or both i depart
on our journei as we went the peopl wept around my litter for sorrow
real or feign for we travel in litter guard by some two hundr
soldier arm with ax of copper and bow and cast flower befor
the feet of the bearer but i did not weep for though i had been veri
kindli treat there and inde worship glad wa i to see the last
of that citi and it peopl who weari me
moreov i felt that there i wa in the midst of plot though of what
these were i knew noth save that quilla who to the outward ey
wa but a love innoc maiden had a hand in them plot there were
inde for as i came to understand in time thei were noth less
than the prepar of a great war which the chanca and the yunca were
to wage against their overlord the inca the king of the mighti nation
of the quichua who had hi home at a citi call cuzco far
inland inde there and then thi allianc wa arrang and by
quillaquilla who propos to sacrific herself and by the gift of
her person to hi heir to throw dust in the ey of the inca whose
dominion her father plan to take and with it the imperi crown of
tavantinsuyu
leav the coastland we were born forward through the pass of great
mountain upon a wonder road so fine made that never had i seen
it like in england at time we cross river but over these were
thrown bridg of stone or mayhap we came to swamp yet there the road
still ran built upon deep foundat in the mud never did it turn
asid alwai it went on conquer everi hindranc for thi wa on
of the inca road that pierc tavantinsuyu from end to end we came
to mani town for thi land wa thickli popul and for the most
part slept in on of them each night but alwai my fame had gone befor
me and the curaca or chief of the town wait upon me with
offer as though i were inde divin
for the first five dai of that journei i saw littl of quilla but at
length on night we were forc to camp at a kind of resthous upon the
top of a high mountain pass where it wa veri cold for the deep snow
lai all about at thi place as here were no curaca to troubl me i
went out alon when kari wa elsewher and climb a certain peak which
wa not far from the resthous that thenc i might see the sunset and
think in quiet
veri gloriou wa the scene from that high point all round me stood
the cold crest of snowclad mountain tower to the veri ski while
between them lai deep vallei where river ran like vein of silver so
immens wa the landscap that it seem to have no end and so grand
that it crush the spirit while abov arch the perfect sky in whose
rich blue the gorgeou light of even began to gather as the great
sun sank behind the snowi peak
far up in the heaven float on widewing bird the eagl of the
mountain which is larger than ani other fowl that i have ever seen
and the red light plai on it turn it to a thing of fire i watch
that bird and wish that i too had pinion which could bear me far awai
to the sea and over it
and yet did i wish to go who had no home left on all the earth and no
kind heart that would welcom me awhil ago i should have answer
ye anywher out of thi loneli but now i wa not so sure here
at least kari wa my friend if a jealou on though of late as i could
see he wa think of other thing than friendshipdark plot and
high ambit of which as yet he said littl to me
then there wa that strang and beauti woman quilla to whom my
heart went out and not onli becaus she wa beauti and who as i
thought at time look kindli on me but if so what did it avail
see that she wa promis in marriag to some highplac nativ
man who would be a king sure i had known enough of women who were
promis in marriag to other men and should do well to let her be
think thu desol took hold of me and i sat myself down on a
rock and cover my face with my hand that i might not see the tear
which i knew were gather in my ey as thei fell from them ye
there in the midst of that aw solitud i hubert of hast whose
soul it fill sat down like a lost child and wept
present i felt a touch upon my shoulder and let fall my hand
think that kari had found me out to hear a soft voic the voic of
quilla sai
so it seem that the god can weep why do you weep o
godfromthewav who here ar name hurachi
i weep i answer becaus i am a stranger in a strang land i weep
becaus i have not wing whereon i can fly awai like that great bird
abov us
she look at me awhil then said most gentli
and whither would you fly o godfromthesea back into the sea
ceas to call me a god i answer who as you know well am but a
man though of anoth race than your
i thought it but i did not know but whither would you fly o lord
hurachi
to the land where i wa born ladi quilla the land that i shall never
see again
ah doubtless there you have wive and children for whom your heart is
hungri
nai now i have neither wife nor child
then onc you had a wife tell me of that wife wa she fair
why should i tell you a sad stori she is dead
dead or live you still love her and where there is love there is no
death
nai i onli love what i thought she wa
wa she fals then
ye fals and yet true so true that she di becaus she wa fals
how can a woman be both fals and true
woman can be all thing ask the question of your own heart can you
not perchanc be both fals and true
she thought awhil and leav thi matter said
so have onc love you can never love again
why not perchanc i can love too much but what would be the us when
more love would but mean more loss and pain
whom should you love my lord hurachi see that the women of your
own folk ar far awai
i think on who is veri near if she would pai back love for love
quilla made no answer and i thought that she wa angri and would go
awai but she did not inde she sat herself down upon the stone at my
side and cover her face with her hand as i had done and began to weep
as i had done now in my turn i ask her
why do you weep
becaus i too must know loneli and with it shame lord hurachi
at these word my heart beat and passion flame up in me stretch
out my hand i drew her awai and in the dy light gaze at the face
beneath lo on it loveli there wa a look which could not be
misread
do you then also love i whisper
ay more i think than ever woman love befor from the moment when
first i saw you sleep in the moonbeam on the desert isl i knew my
fate had found me and that i love i fought against it becaus i must
but that love ha grown and grown till now i am all love and have
given everyth have no more left to give
when i heard thi make no answer i swept her into my arm and kiss
her and there she lai upon my breast and kiss me back
let me go and hear me she murmur present for you ar strong
and i am weak
i obei and she sank back upon the stone
my lord she said our case is veri sad or at least my case is sad
sinc though you be a man mai love often i can love but onc and
my lord it mai not be
why not i ask hoars your peopl think me a god cannot a god
take whom he will to wife
not when she is vow to anoth god he who will be inca not when on
her mayhap hang the fate of nation
we might fly quilla
whither could the godfromthesea fly and whither could fly the
daughter of the moon who is vow to the son of the sun in marriag
save to death
there ar wors thing than death quilla
ay but my life is in pawn i must live that my peopl mai not die
myself i offer it to thi caus and now be royal i cannot take it
back again for my own joi it is better to be shame with honour than to
be love in the lap of shame
what then i ask hopelessli
onli thi that abov us ar the god andheard you not the oracl of
rimac that declar to me that i should slip from the hate arm that
the sun should be my shelter and in the belov arm i should sleep at
last though from the vengeanc of the god betrai i must fly fast
and far i think that thi mean death but also it mean life in death
ando arm belov you shall fold me yet i know not how but have
faithfor you shall fold me yet meanwhil tempt me not from the path
of honour sinc thi i know that it alon can lead me to my home yet
who is the god betrai from whom i must fly who who
thu she spoke and wa silent and i too wa silent ye there we
sat both silent in the dark search the heaven for a guid
star and as we sat present i heard the voic of kari sai
have i found you lord and you also ladi quilla return i prai you
for all search and ar frighten
why i answer the ladi quilla and i studi thi wondrou scene
ye lord though to those who ar not godborn it would be difficult
in thi dark suffer now that i show you the path
chapter v
kari goe
as it chanc dure the remain dai of that journei quilla and i
were not again alon togeth that is to sai except onc for a few
minut for we were never out of eyeshot of someon in our compani
thu kari clung to me veri close inde and when i ask him why
told me bluntli that it wa for my safeti sake a god to remain a god
he said should live alon in a templ when he began to mix with other
of the earth and to do those thing thei did to eat and to drink
to laugh and to frown even to slip in the mud or to stumbl over the
stone in the common path those other would come to think that there
wa small differ between god and man especi would thei think
so if he were observ to love the compani of women or to melt beneath
their soft glanc
now i grew sore at the sting of these arrow which of late he had
love to shoot at me and without pretend to misunderstand him said
outright
the truth is kari that you ar jealou of the ladi quilla as onc you
were jealou of anoth
he consid the matter in hi grave fashion and answer
ye master that is the truth or part of it you save my life and
shelter me when i wa alon in a strang land and for thi and for
yourself i came to love you veri greatli and love if it be true is
alwai jealou and alwai hate a rival
there ar differ sort of love i said that of a man for man is
on that of man for woman is anoth
ye master and that of woman for man is a third moreov there is
thi about itit is the acid which turn all other love sour where
ar a man friend when a woman ha him by the heartalthough
perchanc thei love him better than ever will the woman who at bottom
love herself best of all still let that be for so natur work and
who can fight against natur what quilla take kari lose and kari
must be content to lose
have you done i ask angrili who weari of hi homili
no master the matter of jealousi is small and privat so is the
matter of love but master you have not told me outright whether you
love the ladi quilla and what is more import whether she love
you
then i will tell you now i do and she doe
you love the ladi quilla and she sai that she love you which mai or
mai not be true or if true todai mai be fals tomorrow for your sake
i hope that it is not true
why i said in a rage
becaus master in thi land there ar mani sort of poison as i have
learn to my cost also there ar knive if not of steel and mani who
might wish to discov whether a god who court women like a man can be
harm by poison or pierc by knive oh he ad in anoth tone
ceas from hi bitter jest believ me that i would shield not mock
you thi ladi quilla is a queen in a great game of piec such as you
taught me to plai far awai in england and without her perchanc that
game cannot be won or so those who plai it think now you would steal
that queen and therebi as thei also think bring death and destruct
on a countri it is not safe master there ar plenti of fair women in
thi land take your pick of them but leav that on queen alon
kari i answer if there be such a game ar you not perchanc on
of the player on thi side or on that
it mai be so master and if you have not guess it perhap on dai
i will tell you upon which side i plai it mai even be that for my own
sake i should be glad to see you lift thi queen from off the board and
that what i tell you is for love of you and not of myself also of the
ladi quilla who if you fall fall with you down through the black
night into the arm of the moon her mother but i have said enough and
inde it is foolish to wast breath in such talk sinc fate will have
it wai with both of you and the end of the game in which we plai is
alreadi written in pachacamac book for everi on of us did not rimac
speak of it the other night so plai on plai on and let destini fulfil
itself if i dare to give counsel it wa onli becaus he who watch
the battl with a gener ey see more of it than he who fight
then he bow in hi state fashion and left me and it wa long er he
spoke to me again of thi matter of quilla and our love for on anoth
when he wa gone my anger against him pass sinc i saw that he wa
warn me of more than he dare to sai not for himself but becaus
he love me moreov i wa afraid for i felt that i wa move in the
web of a great plot that i did not understand of which quilla and those
coldei lordl of her compani and the chief whose guest i had
been and kari himself and mani other as yet unknown to me spun the
invis thread on dai these might choke me well if thei did what
then onli i fear for quillagreatli i fear for quilla
on the dai follow my talk with kari at length we reach the great
citi of the chanca which after them wa call chancaat least i
alwai knew it by that name from the dawn we had been pass through
rich vallei where dwelt thousand of these chanca who i could see
were a mighti peopl that bore themselv proudli and like soldier
in multitud thei gather themselv togeth upon either side of the
road chiefli to catch a sight of me the white god who had risen from
the ocean but also to greet their princess the ladi quilla
inde now i learn for the first time how high a princess she wa
sinc when her litter pass these folk prostrat themselv kiss
the air and the dust moreov as soon as she came among them quilla
bear chang for her carriag grew more haughti and her word
fewer now she seldom spoke save to issu a command not even to myself
although i note that she studi me with her ey when she thought that
i wa not observ her
dure our middai halt i look up and saw that an armi wa approach
us five thousand men or more and ask kari it mean
these he answer ar some of the troop of huaracha king of the
chanca whom he send out to greet hi daughter and onli child also
hi guest the white god
some of the troop ha he more then
ay master ten time as mani as i think thi is a great peopl
almost as great as that of the inca who live at cuzco come now into
the tent and put on your armour that you mai be readi to meet them
i did so and step forth clad in the shine steel took my stand
where kari show me upon a rise of ground on my right at a littl
distanc stood quilla more splendidli arrai than i had ever seen
her and behind her her maiden and the captain and counsellor of her
follow
the armi drew nearer marshal in regiment and halt on the plain
some two hundr yard awai present from it advanc gener and
old men clad in white whom i took to be priest and elder thei
approach to the number of twenti or more and bow deepli first to
quilla who bent her head in acknowledg and then to myself after
thi thei went to speak with quilla and her follow but what thei
said i did not know all the while howev their ey were fix on
me then quilla brought them to me and on by on thei bow befor me
sai someth in a languag which i did not understand well for it
wa somewhat differ from that which kari had taught me
after thi we enter the litter and escort by that great armi
were born forward down vallei and over ridg till about sunset we
came to a larg cuplik plain in the centr of which stood the citi
call chanca of thi citi i did not see much except that it wa veri
great as the dark wa fall when we enter and afterward i
could not go out becaus of the crowd that press about me i wa
born down a wide street to a hous that stood in a larg garden which
wa wall about here in thi fine hous i found food prepar for me
and drink all of it serv in dish and cup of gold and silver also
there were women who wait upon me as did kari who now wa call
zapana and seem to be my slave
when i had eaten i went out alon into the garden for on thi plain
the air wa veri warm and pleasant it wa a beauti garden and
i wander about among it avenu and flower bush glad to be
solitari and to have time to think amongst other thing i wonder
where quilla might be for of her i had seen noth from the time that
we enter the town i hate to be part from her becaus in thi vast
strang land into which i had wander she wa the onli on for whom i
had come to care and without whom i felt i should die of loneli
there wa kari it is true who i knew love me in hi fashion but
between him and me there wa a great gulf fix not onli of race and
faith but of someth now which i did not wholli understand in london
he had been my servant and hi end were my end on our wander he
had been my companion in great adventur but now i knew that other
interest and desir had taken a hold of him and that he trod a road
of which i could not see the goal and no longer thought much of me save
when what i did or desir to do came between him and that goal
therefor quilla alon wa left to me and quilla wa about to be taken
awai oh i weari of thi strang land with it snowclad mountain and
rich vallei it hord of darkskin peopl with larg ey smile
face and secret heart it great citi templ and palac fill
with useless gold and silver it brilliant sunshin and rush river
it god king and polici thei were alien to me everi on of
them and if quilla were taken awai and i were left quit alon then i
thought that it would be well to die
someth move behind a palm trunk of the avenu in which i walk and
not know whether it were beast or man i laid my hand upon my sword
which i still wore although i had taken off the armour befor i could
draw it my wrist wa grasp and a soft voic whisper in my ear
fear noth it is iquilla
quilla it wa wrap in a long hood cloak such as the peasant women
wear in the cold countri for she threw back the hood and a beam of
starlight fell upon her face
hearken she said it is danger to both of us but i have come to
bid you farewel
farewel i fear it would be thu but why so soon quilla
for thi reason love and lord i have seen my father the king and
made my report to him of the matter with which i wa sent to deal among
the yunca it pleas him and sinc hi mood wa graciou i open
my heart to him and told him that no longer did i wish to be given in
marriag to urco who will soon put on the inca fring for as you
know it is to him that i am promis
what did he answer quilla
he answer thi mean daughter that you have met some other man to
whom you do wish to be given in marriag i will not ask hi name sinc
if i knew it it would be my duti to kill him howev high and nobl he
might be
then he guess quilla
i think he guess i think that alreadi some have whisper in hi
ear but he doe not wish to listen who desir to remain deaf and
blind
did he sai no more quilla
he said much more he said thisnow i tell you secret lord and
place my honour in your keep for have given you all the rest why
should i not give you that also he said daughter you who have been
my ambassador you my onli child who know all my counsel know also
that there is about to be the greatest war that the land of tavantinsuyu
ha ever known war between the two mighti nation of the quichua of
cuzco whereof the old upanqui is king and god and the chanca whereof
i am king and you if you live in a dai to come will be the queen no
longer can these two lion dwell in the same forest on of them must
devour the other nor shall i fight alon sinc on our side ar all the
yunca of the coast who as you report to me ar ripe for rebellion
but as you also report and as i have learn from other thei ar not
yet readi moon must go by befor their armi ar join to mine and i
throw off the mask is it not so
i answer that it wa so and my father went on
then dure that time daughter a dust must be rais that will hide
the shine of my spear and daughter you ar that dust tomorrow
the old inca upanqui visit me here with a small armi i read your
thought it iswhi do you not kill him and hi armi daughter for thi
reason he is veri ag and about to lai down hi sceptr who grow
feebl of mind and bodi if i kill him what would it serv me see
that he ha left hi son urco who will be inca rule at cuzco and
that of hi soldier not on in fifti will be with him here moreov
he is my guest and the god frown on those who slai their guest nor
will men ever trust them more
now i answer you spoke of me as a cloud of dust father how then
can thi poor dust serv your end and those of the chanca peopl
thu daughter he answer with your own consent you ar promis
in marriag to urco upanqui the inca ha heard rumour that the chanca
prepar for war therefor he who travel on hi last journei through
certain of hi dominion come to lead you awai to be urco bride
sai to himself if those rumour ar true king huaracha will
withhold hi onli child and heiress sinc never will he make war upon
cuzco if she rule there as it queen therefor if i refus you to
him he will withdraw and begin the war roll down hi thousand
upon us befor we ar readi and bring the chanca to destruct and
enslav therefor also not onli my fate but the fate of all your
countri li in your hand
father i said tell me who wa ever dear to you that lack son is
there no escap must i eat thi bitter bread befor you answer learn
that you have guess aright and that i who when i made that promis
care for no man have come to feel the burn of love fire
now he look at me awhil then said child of the moon there is but
on escap and it must be soughtin the moon the dead cannot be given
in marriag if your strait is so sore though it would cut me to
the heart perchanc it is better that you should die and go whither
doubtless he whom you love will soon follow you depart now and counsel
with heaven in your sleep tomorrow befor upanqui come we will talk
again
so i knelt and kiss the hand of the king my father and left him
wonder at hi nobl who could show such a road to hi onli child
though it tread would mean woe to him and mayhap the ruin of hi
hope still that road is an old on among the women of my peopl and
why should i not walk it as thousand have done befor me
how came you here i ask hoars
lord i guess that you would be walk in thi garden which join on
to that of the palac andnon were about andth door in the
wall wa open inde it wa almost as though i were left alon and
unwatch of set purpos so i came and soughtand found have a
question to put to you
what question quilla
thi shall i live or shall i die speak the word and i obei yet er
you speak rememb that if i live we meet for the last time sinc veri
soon i go henc to becom the wife of urco and plai the part that is
prepar for me
now when i hubert heard these word i felt as though my heart would
burst within my breast and knew not what to sai so to gain time i ask
her
which do you desireto live or to die
she laugh a littl as she answer
that is a strang question lord have i not told you that if i live
i must do so befoul as on of urco women wherea if i die i die
clean and take my love with me to where urco cannot come but where
mayhap anoth mai follow at the appoint time
which time would be veri soon i think quilla see that he who had
spoil all thi pretti plot would scarc be left long upon the earth
even if he wish to stai there yet i sai do not dieliv on
to becom urco woman that is strang counsel from a lover lip
lord such as would scarc have been given by ani of our nobl
ay quilla and it is given becaus i am not of your peopl and do not
think as thei think who reject their custom you ar not yet urco
wife and mai be rid of him by other path than that of death but from
the grave there is no escap
and in the grave there is no more fear lord thither urco cannot come
there ar neither war nor plot there honour doe not beckon
and love hold back i sai that i will die and make an end as for like
caus mani of my blood have done though not here and now when i am
about to be deliv to urco then i will die and perchanc not alon
perchanc he will accompani me she ad slowli
and if thi happen what shall i do
live on lord and find other women to love you as a god should there
ar mani in thi land fairer and wiser than i and save myself you mai
take whom you will
listen quilla i have a stori to tell you
then as briefli as i could i set out the tale of blanch and of her
end while she hung upon my everi word
oh i griev for you she said when i had finish
you griev for me and yet what she did for my sake you would do also
so that as it were both my hand must be dy with blood thi first
terror i have born but if a second fall upon me then i know that i
shall go mad and perish in thi wai or in that and you quilla will be
my murderess
no no not that she murmur
then swear to me by your god and by your spirit that you will do
yourself no harm whatev chanc and that if die you must it shall
be with me for compani
is your love so great that you would dare thi for my sake lord
i think so though not till all els had fail i think that if you
were taken from me quilla i could not live on here in loneli and
exilehowev great the sin but do you swear

children you shall have also of whom you need not be asham though my
dark blood run in them and armi at command and palac fill with
gold and all royal joi and if perchanc the god declar against us
and we pass from the world togeth then i think oh then i think that
i shall give you finer gift than these though what thei ar i know not
yet sinc to the power of love there is no endher on earth or yonder
in the ski
i stare at her face in the starlight and oh it had grown splendid
no longer wa it that of a woman sinc through it like light through
pearl shone a soul divin it might have been a goddess who stood
besid me for those ey were holi and her embrac that wrap me
close wa not that of the flesh alon

we mai not speak again for long but trust me alwai plai your part and
i will plai mine follow me wherev i am taken and keep near to me
if you mai as ever my spirit shall be near to you then what matter
anyth even if we ar slain farewel belov kiss me and

anoth moment and she had glide awai and wa lost in the shadow
she wa gone and i stood amaz and overcom oh what a love it wa
that thi alien woman had given to me and how could i be worthi of it
now i forgot my grief now i no longer mourn becaus i wa an outcast
who nevermor might look upon the land where i wa born nor see the
face of on my own race or blood all my loss wa paid back to me again
and yet again in the coin of the glori of thi woman whom i had won
danger rose about us but i fear them no more becaus i knew that
her love conquer feet would stamp them flat and lead me safe to a
joy treasurehous of splendour of spirit and of bodi where we should
dwell side by side triumphant and unafraid
whilst i thought thu lost in a raptur such as i had not felt sinc
blanch kiss me at the mouth of the hast cave after i had kill
the three frenchmen with as mani arrow from my black bow i heard a
sound and look up to see a man stand befor me
who is it i ask grasp my sword for hi face wa hidden in the
shadow
i answer a voic which i knew to be that of kari
then how did you come here i saw no on pass the open ground
master you ar not the onli on who love to walk in garden in the
quiet of the night i wa here befor yourself behind yonder tree and
he point to a palm not three pace distant

point at which i shut my ey and stop my ear but still much
i am mind to kill you kari i said between my teeth who plai the
spy upon me
i guess it would be so master he repli in hi gentlest voic
and for that reason as you will notic i am stand out of reach of
your sword you wonder why i am here i will tell you it is not from
ani desir to watch your lovemak which weari me who have seen such
befor but rather that i might find secret of which love is alwai
the loser and those secret i have learn how could i have come by
them otherwis master

i think not master but listen and judg for yourself i have told you
someth of my stori now you shall hear more after which we will talk
of what i do or do not deserv i am the eldest son of the inca upanqui
and urco of whom you have been talk is my younger brother but
upanqui our father love urco mother while mine he did not love and

son should be inca after him therefor he hate me becaus i stood in
urco path therefor too mani troubl befel me and i wa given over
into urco hand so that he took my wife and tri to poison me and
the rest you know now it wa need to me to learn how thing went
and for thi reason i listen to the talk between you and a certain
ladi it told me that upanqui my father come here tomorrow which
inde i knew alreadi and much els that i had not heard thi be
so i must vanish awai sinc doubtless upanqui or hi councillor would
know me again and as thei ar all of them friend of urco perhap i
should tast more poison and of a stronger sort
whither will you vanish kari

that night i slept but ill who wa overwhelm with all that had
befallen me of good and evil i had gain a wondrou love but she who
gave it wa it seem about to be lost to me ay and to be thrown
to anoth whom she hate to forward the dark polici of a great and
warlik peopl i had spoken to her with high word of hope but of it
in my heart there wa littl she would follow what she held to be her
duti to the end and that end if she kept her promis and did not die
as she desir to dowasth arm of urco from these i could see no
escap for her and the thought madden me moreov kari wa gone
leav me utterli alon among these stranger and whether he would
return again i did not know oh almost i wish that i were dead
the morn broke at last and i aros and call for zapana then came
other who said that my servant zapana could not be found whereat
i affect surpris and anger still these other wait on me well
enough and i rose and at in pomp and luxuri scarc had i finish
my meal than there appear herald who summon me to the presenc of
the king huaracha
i went born in a litter although an arrow from my black bow would
have flown from door to door at the portal of the palac which wa
like other i had seen onli finer i wa met by soldier and gaili
dress servant and led across a courtyard within which i could see
wa prepar for some ceremoni to a small chamber on the further side
here when my ey grew accustom to the halfdark i perceiv a
man of some sixti year of ag and behind him two soldier at onc i
note that everyth about thi man wa plain and simpl the chamber
which wa littl more than four whitewash wall with a floor of stone
the stool he sat on even hi apparel here were no gold or silver or
broider cloth or gem or other rich and costli thing such as these
peopl love but rather those that ar suit to a soldier a soldier he
look inde be burli and broad and scar upon hi home face
in which gleam ey that were steadi and pierc
as i enter the king huaracha for it wa he rose from hi stool and
bow to me and i bow back to him then he motion to on of the
soldier to give me anoth stool upon which i sat myself and speak
in a strong low voic us that tongu which kari had taught me
said
greet whitegodfromthesea or goldenbeard man name the lord
hurachi i know not which of whom i have heard so much and whom i am
glad to behold in my poor citi sai can you understand my talk
thu he spoke search me with hi ey though all the while i
perceiv that thei rest rather on my armour and the great sword
waveflam than on my face
i gave him back hi greet and answer that i understood the tongu
he us though not so veri well whereon he began to speak about the
armour and the sword which puzzl him who had never seen steel
make me some like them he said and i will give you ten time their
weight in gold which after all is of no us sinc with it on cannot
kill enemi
in my countri with it on can corrupt them i answer or bui them
to be friend
so you have a countri he interrupt shrewdli i thought that the
god had none
even the god live somewher i repli
he laugh and turn to the two soldier who also were stare at my
mail and sword bade them go when the heavi door had shut behind them
and we were quit alon he said
my lord hurachi i have heard from my daughter how she found you in
the sea a stori inde i have also heard or guess it matter not
which that her heart ha turn toward you as is not strang see
the manner of man you ar if inde you be not more than man and that
women ar ever prone to love those whom thei think thei have save is
thi true my lord hurachi

hearken my lord hurachi you ar my honour guest and save on thing
all i have is your but you must talk no more alon with the ladi
quilla in garden at night
now make no attempt to deni or explain which i saw would be useless
sinc he knew it all i ask boldli
why not
i thought that perchanc my daughter had told you lord hurachi but if
you desir to hear it from my own lip also for thi reason the ladi
quilla is promis in marriag and if she live that promis must be
fulfil sinc on it hang the fate of nation therefor it is
although to griev to part such a pair that you and she must meet no
more in garden or elsewher know that if you do you will bring about
her death and your own if god can die
now i thought awhil and answer
these ar heavi word king huaracha see that i will not hide from
you that i love your daughter well and that she who is greatheart
love me well and desir me for her husband
i know it and i griev for both of you he said courteous

now god or man i also am a soldier king and i know art of battl
which perhap ar hidden from you and your peopl also i cannot be
harm by weapon becaus of magic armour that i wear and none can
stand befor me in fight becaus of thi magic sword i carri and i can

us to you were i the husband of your daughter and therefor your
son and friend and perchanc by my skill make the differ to you and
your nation between victori and defeat
doubtless thi is so o sonofthesea
in the same fashion king were i upon the side of your enemi to

god and for aught i know be king after me not onli of my countri but
mayhap of anoth that is even greater
it is a good offer king but not enough give me your daughter
quilla and you mai keep all the rest
white lord i cannot sinc to do so i must break my word
then king i cannot serv you and unless you kill me firstif you

that he cannot yet he can remain a guest to my countri you have come

that silver coat quilla goe henc but here you bide my lord hurachi
perchanc i shall find the wing i answer
ay lord for it is said that the dead fly and if i mai not kill you

thing as my poor countri can give you and not to try to follow the
moon by thi he meant quilla to the golden citi of cuzco which
henceforth must be her home
now have no more to sai sinc war had been declar between us as
it were i rose to bid thi king farewel he also rose then as
though struck by a sudden thought said that he desir to speak with my
servant zapana he whom the ladi quilla had found with me in the island
of the sea i repli that he could not sinc zapana had vanish i
knew not where
at thi intellig he appear to be disturb and wa begin to
question me somewhat sternli as to who zapana might be and how i had
first come into hi compani when the door of the room open and
through it quilla enter even more gorgeous robe and look
loveli than ever i had seen her she bow first to the king and then
to me sai

to thi whitesonofthesea sinc it is my will that you depart with
upanqui who come to escort you to cuzco the citi of the sun there to
be given as wife to the princ urco son of the sun who will sit on the
inca throne
i make my farewel to the lord hurachi as you command she answer
curtsei and in a veri quiet voic but know my father that i
love thi white lord as he love me and that therefor although i
mai be given to the princ urco as a gold cup is given never shall he
drink from the cup and never will i be hi wife

the rest settl the matter as you will and if you can slip from the
coil of thi snake of an urco unpoison do so sinc my bargain is

the lord hurachi nor shall the lord hurachi go to you at cuzco
that shall be as the god decre my father and meanwhil i plai my
part as you decre lord hurachi fare you well till in life or death
we meet again
then she bow to me and went and present without more word we
follow after her
in front of the palac there wa a great squar of open ground
surround by hous except toward the east and on thi squar
wa marshal an armi of men all splendidli arrai and carri
copperhead spear in front of these wa pitch a great pavilion
made of cloth of variou colour here king huaracha simpli dress in
a robe of white cotton but wear a littl crown of gold and carri
a larg spear took hi seat upon a throne while to hi right on a
smaller throne sat quilla and on hi left stood yet anoth throne
ornament with gold that wa empti between the throne of huaracha and
that which wa empti stood a chair cover with silver on which i wa
bidden to take my seat so place that all could see me while behind
and around were lord and gener
scarc were we arrang when from the dip beyond the open space
appear herald who carri spear and were fantast dress
these shout that the inca upanqui the child of the sun the god who
rule the earth drew near
let him approach said huaracha briefli and thei depart
awhil later there aros a sound of barbar music and of chant and
from the dip below emerg a glitter litter born upon the shoulder
of richli cloth men all of whom i wa told afterward were princ
by blood and surround by beauti women who carri jewel fan
and by councillor it wa the litter of the inca upanqui and after
it march a guard of pick warrior perhap there were a hundr of
them not more
the litter wa set down in front of the throne gild curtain were
drawn and out of it came a man whose attir dazzl the ey it seem
to consist of gold and preciou stone sewn on to a mantl of crimson
wool he wore a headdress also of as mani colour as joseph coat
surmount by two feather which he alon might bear from which
headdress a scarlet fring that wa made of tassel wool hung down
upon hi forehead thi wa the inca crown even to touch which wa
death and it name wa lautu he wa a veri old man for hi white
lock and beard hung down upon hi splendid garment and he support
himself upon hi royal staff that wa head by a great emerald hi
finecut face also though still kingli wa weak with ag and hi ey
were blear at the sight of him all rose and huaracha descend from hi
throne sai in a loud voic
welcom to the land of the chanca o upanqui inca of the quichua
the old monarch ei him for a moment then answer in a thin voic
greet to huaracha curaca of the chanca
huaracha bow and said
i thank you but here among my own peopl my titl is not curaca but
king o inca
upanqui drew himself up to hi full height and repli
the inca know no king throughout the land of tavantinsuyu save
themselv o huaracha
be it so o inca yet the chanca who ar unconqu know a king
and i am he i prai you be seat o inca
upanqui stood still for a moment frown and as i thought wa about
to make some short answer when suddenli hi glanc fell upon me and
chang the current of hi mind
is that the whitegodfromthesea he ask with an almost childish
curios i heard that he wa here and to tell the truth that is why
i came just to look at him not to bandi word with you o huaracha
who thei sai can onli be talk to with a spear point what a red beard
he ha and how hi coat shine let him come and worship me
he will come but i do not think that he will worship thei sai he is a
god himself o inca
do thei well now i rememb there ar strang propheci about a
white god who should rise out of the sea as did the forefath of the
inca thei sai too that thi god shall do much mischief to the land
when he come so perhap he had better not draw too near to me for i
like not the look of that great big sword of hi by the sun my father
he is tall and big and strong i had risen from my chair and hi
beard is like a fire it will set the heart of all the women burn
though perhap if he is a god he doe not care for women i must consult
my magician about it and the head priest of the templ of the sun
tell the white god to make readi to return with me to cuzco
the lord hurachi is my guest o inca and here he bide with me said
huaracha
nonsens nonsens when the inca invit ani on to hi court he must
come but enough of him for the present i came here to talk of other
matter what were thei let me sit down and think
so he wa conduct to hi throne upon which he sat try to collect
hi mind which i saw wa weak with ag the end of it wa that he
call to hi aid a sternfac shiftyei middleag minist whom
after i came to know as the highpriest larico the privat councillor
of himself and of hi son urco and on of the most power men in
the kingdom thi nobl i note wa on who had the rank of an earman
that is he wore in hi ear which like that of kari wa stretch
out to receiv it a golden disc of the size of an appl whereon wa
emboss the imag of the sun
at a sign and a word from hi dotard master thi larico began to speak
for him as though he were the inca himself sai
hearken o huaracha i have undertaken thi toilsom journei the last
i shall make as inca for be it known to you that i purpos to divest
myself of the royal fring in favour of the princ urco begotten to
me in the bodi and of the sun in spirit and to retir to end my dai in
peac at my palac of yucai wait there patient until it pleas my
father the sun to take me to hi bosom
here larico paus to allow thi great new to sink into the mind of
hi hearer and i thought to myself that when i di i would choos to
be gather to ani bosom rather than to that of the sun which put me in
mind of hell then he went on
rumour have reach me the inca that you huaracha chief of the
chanca ar make readi to wage war upon my empir it wa to test
these rumour although i did not believ them that awhil ago i sent
an embassi to ask your onli child the ladi quilla in marriag to the
princ urco promis sinc he ha no sister whom he mai wed and sinc
on the mother side she your daughter ha the holi inca blood in her
vein that she should becom hi coya or queen and the mother of
him who shall succe to the throne
the embassi came and receiv my answer o inca said huaracha
ye and the answer wa that the ladi quilla should be given in
marriag to the princ urco but as she wa absent on a visit thi
could not happen until she return but sinc then o huaracha more
rumour have reach me that you still prepar for war and seek to
make allianc among my subject tempt them to rebel against me
therefor i am here myself to lead awai the ladi quilla and to deliv
her to the princ urco
why did not the princ urco come in person o inca
for thi reason huaracha from whom i desir to hide noth if the
princ had come you might have set a trap for him and kill him who
is the hope of the empir
so i might for you hi father o inca
ay i know it but what would that avail you while the princ sit
safe at cuzco readi to assum the fring also i am old and care not
when or how i die whose work is done moreov few would desir to
anger the god by the murder of an ag guest and therefor i visit
you sit here in the midst of your armi with but a hand of
follow trust to your honour and to my father the sun to protect
me now answer mewil you give the hand of your daughter to my son and
therebi make allianc with me or will you wage war upon my empir and
be destroi you and your peopl togeth
here upanqui who hitherto had been listen in silenc to the word of
larico spoken on hi behalf broke in sai
ye ye that is right onli make him understand that the inca will be
hi overlord sinc the inca can have no rival in all the land
my answer is said huaracha that i will give my daughter in marriag
as i have promis but that the chanca ar a free peopl and accept no
overlord
foolish foolish said upanqui as well might the tree sai
that it would not bend befor the wind howev you can settl that
matter afterward with urco and inde with your daughter who will be
hi queen and is your heiress for i understand you have no other law
child why talk of war and other troubl when thu your kingdom fall
to us by marriag now let me see thi ladi quilla who is to becom my
daughter
huaracha who had listen to all thi babbl with a stern set face
turn to quilla and made a sign she descend from her chair and
advanc stood befor the inca a vision of splendour and of beauti
and bow to him he stare at her awhil as did all hi compani then
said
so you ar the ladi quilla a fair woman a veri fair woman and a
proud on who ought to be abl to lead urco aright if ani on can well
name too after the moon for the moonlight seem to shine in your
ey ladi quilla inde and inde were i but a score of year younger
i should tell urco to seek anoth queen and keep you for myself
then quilla spoke for the first time sai
be it as you will o inca i am promis in marriag to the child of
the sun and which child is noth to me
well said ladi quilla and why should i wonder though i grow old thei
tell me that i am still handsom a great deal better look than urco
in fact who is a rough man and of a coarser type you ask my wive when
you come to cuzco on of them told me the other dai that there wa no
on so handsom in the whole citi and earn a beauti present
for her pretti speech what is it you sai larico why ar you alwai
interf with me well perhap you ar right and ladi quilla if
you ar readi it is time to start no no i thank you curaca but i
will not stop for ani feast who desir to be back at my camp befor
dark sinc who know what mai happen to on in the dark in a strang
countri
then at last huaracha grew angri
be it as you will o inca he said but know that you offer me a
threefold insult first you refus the feast that ha been made readi
for you whereat you were to meet all the notabl of my kingdom
secondli you give me who am a king the titl of a petti chief who
own your rule thirdli you throw doubt upon my honour hint that i
mai caus you to be murder in the dark now i am mind to sai to
you begon from my poor countri lord inca in safeti but leav my
daughter behind you
now at these word i hubert saw the fire of hope burn up in the
larg ey of quilla as thei did in my own heart for might thei not
mean that she would escap from urco after all but ala thei were
extinguish like a brand that is dip in water
tush tush said the old dotard what a fireeat ar you friend
huaracha know that i never care to eat except at night also that the
chill of the air after my father the sun ha set make my bone ach
and as for titlestak ani on you like except that of inca
mayhap that is the on i shall take befor all is done broke in the
furiou huaracha who would not be quiet by the councillor whisper
in hi ear
it wa at thi moment that the minist and highpriest larico who had
been note all that pass with an impass face said coldli
be not wroth o king huaracha and lai not too much weight upon the
idl word of the gloriou inca sinc even the god will doze at time
when thei ar weigh down by the care of empir no affront wa meant
to you and least of all doe the inca or ani on of us dream that you
would tarnish your honour by offer violenc to your guest by dai
or by night yet know thi that if after all that ha been sworn you
withhold your daughter the ladi quilla from the hous of urco who is
her lord to be it will breed instant war sinc as soon as word of it
come to cuzco which will be within twenti hour for messeng wait
all along the road the great armi of the inca that ar gather there
will begin to move judg then if you have the strength to withstand
them and choos whether you will live on in glori and honour or
bring yourself to death and your peopl to slaveri now king huaracha
speak on behalf of urco who within some few moon will be inca i
ask youwil you suffer the ladi quilla to journei with us to cuzco
and therebi proclaim peac between our peopl or will you keep her here
against your oath and her and therebi declar war
huaracha sat silent lost in thought and the old inca upanqui began to
babbl again sai
veri well put i could not have said it better myself inde i did
sai it for thi coxcomb of a larico who think himself so clever
just becaus i made him highpriest of the sun under me and he is of my
blood is after all noth but the tongu in my mouth you dont realli
want to die huaracha do you after see most of your peopl kill
and your countri wast for you know that is what must happen if you
do not send your daughter as you promis within a few hour a hundr
thousand men will be march on you and anoth hundr thousand
gather behind them anyhow pleas make up your mind on wai or
anoth as i wish to leav thi place
huaracha thought on awhil then he descend from hi throne and
beckon to quilla she came and he led her toward the back part of
the pavilion behind and a littl to the left of the chair on which i sat
where none could hear their talk save me of whom he seem to take no
note perhap becaus he had forgotten me or perhap becaus he desir
that i should know all
daughter he said in a low voic what word befor you answer
rememb that if i refus to send you now for the first time i break my
oath
of such oath i think littl answer quilla yet of anoth thing i
think much tell me my father if the inca declar war and attack us
can we withstand hi armi
no daughter not until the yunca join us for we lack suffici
men moreov we ar not readi nor shall be for anoth two moon or
more
then it stand thu father if i do not go the war will begin and
if i do go it seem that it will be stave off until you ar readi or
perhap for alwai becaus i shall be the peaceoff and it will be
thought that i your heiress take your kingdom as my marriag portion
to be join to that of the inca at your death is it thu
it is quilla onli then you will work to bring it about that the land
of the inca shall be join to the land of the chanca and not that of
the chanca to that of the inca so that in a dai to come as queen of
the chanca you shall reign over both of them and your children after
you
now i hubert watch quilla out of the corner of my ey saw her
turn pale and trembl
speak not to me of children she said for i think that there will be
none and talk not of futur glori sinc for these i care noth it
is for our peopl that i care you swear to me that if i do not go your
armi will be defeat and that those who escap the spear will be
enslav
ay i swear it by the moon your mother also that i will die with my
soldier
yet if i go i leav behind me that which i love here she glanc
toward me and give myself to shame which is wors than death is
that your desir my father
that is not my desir rememb daughter that you were parti to thi
plan ay that it sprang from your farse mind still now that
your heart ha chang i would not hold you to your bargain who desir
most of all thing to see you happi at my side choos therefor and i
obei on your head be it
what shall i sai o lord whom i save from the sea ask quilla in a
pierc whisper but without turn her head toward me
now an agoni took hold of me for i knew that what i bade her that she
would sai and that perchanc upon my answer hung the fate of all thi
great chanca peopl if she went thei would be save if she remain
perchanc she would be my wife if onli for a while for the chanca i
care noth and for the quichua i care noth but quilla wa all
that remain to me in the world and if she went it wa to anoth man
i would bid her bide and yetand yet if her case were mine and the
fate of england hung upon my breath what then

then i spoke or someth spoke through me sai

without honour perchanc both shall still be your at last
i thank you lord whose heart speak as my heart she whisper for
the third time then lift her head and look huaracha in the ey
said

chapter vii
the return of kari
so quilla seat in a golden litter and accompani by maiden as
becam her rank soon wa born awai in the train of the inca upanqui
leav me desol befor she went under pretenc of bid me
farewel none deni her she gain privat speech with me for a
littl while
lord and lover she said i go to what fate i know not leav you
to what fate i know not and as your lip have said it is right that i
should go now i have someth to ask of youthat you will not follow
me as it is in your heart to do but last night i prai of you to dog
my step and wherev i might go to keep close to me that the knowledg
of your presenc might be my comfort now my mind is differ if i
must be marri to thi urco i would not have you see me in my shame
and if i escap marriag you cannot help me sinc i mai onli do so by
death or by take refug where you cannot come also i have anoth
reason
what reason quilla i ask
thi i ask that you will stop with my father and give him your help in
the war that must come i would see thi urco crush but without that
help i am sure that the chanca and the yunca ar too weak to overthrow
the inca might rememb that if i escap marriag thu onli can you
hope to win me name by the defeat and death of urco sai then
that you will stai here and help to lead the chanca armi and sai
it swiftli sinc that dotard upanqui fret to be gone hark hi
messeng call and search my women can hold them back no more
i will stai i answer hoars
i thank you and now farewel till in life or death we meet again
thought come to my mind which i have no time to utter
to mine also quilla and here is on of them you know the man who wa
with me on the island well he is more than he seem
so i guess but where is he now
in hide quilla if you should chanc to find him bear in mind that
he is an enemi of urco and on not friendless also that he love me
after hi fashion trust him i prai you urco is not the onli on of
the inca blood quilla
she glanc at me quickli and nod her head then without more word
for offic were press toward us she drew a ring off her finger
a thick and ancient golden ring on which were cut what look like
flower or imag of the sun and gave it to me
wear thi for my sake it is veri old and ha a stori of true love that
i have no time to tell she said
i took it and in exchang pass to her that ancient ring which my
mother had given to me the ring that had come down to her with the
sword waveflam sai
thi too is old and ha a stori wear it in memori of me
then we part and present she wa gone
i stood watch her litter till it vanish in the even haze then i
turn to go to find myself face to face with huaracha
lordfromthesea he said you have plai a mansor a godspart
todai had you bidden my daughter bide here she would have done so for
love of you and the chanca peopl must have been destroi for as that
old inca or hi spokesman told us the break of my oath would have
been taken as a declar of instant war now we have breath time
and in the end thing mai go otherwis
ye i answer but what of quilla and what of me
i know not your creed or what with you is honour white lord but among
us whom perhap you think of small account it is thought and held that
there ar time when a man or a woman especi if thei be highli
place must do sacrific for the good of the mani who cling to them
for guidanc and for safeti thi you and my daughter have done and
therefor i honour both of you
to what end is the sacrific made i ask bitterli that on peopl
mai struggl for dominion over anoth peopl no more
you ar mistaken lord not for victori or to increas my dominion
do i desir to war upon the inca but becaus unless i strike i shall
present be struck though for a littl while thi marriag might hold
back the blow alon in the midst of the vast territori over which
the inca rule the chanca stem their tide of conquest and remain free
amongst mani nation of slave therefor for ag these inca like
those who rule befor them at cuzco have sworn to destroi us and urco
ha sworn it abov all
urco might die or be depos huaracha
if so anoth would put on the fring and be vow to the ancient
polici that doe not chang from gener to gener therefor i
must fight or perish with my peopl hearken lordfromthesea stai
here with me and becom as my brother and a gener of my armi for
where will thei not follow when you lead who ar held to be a god then
if we conquer in reward from a brother you shall becom a son and to
you after me i swear shall pass the chanca crown moreov to you
if she can be save i will give in marriag her whom you love think
befor you refus i know not whenc you come but thi i know that you
can return thither no more unless inde you ar a spirit here your
lot is cast till death therefor make it gloriou perchanc you might
fly to the inca and there becom a marvel and a show furnish with
gold and palac and land but alwai you would be a servant while i
offer to you a crown and the rule of a peopl great and free
i care noth for crown i answer sigh still such wa
quilla prayer perchanc the last that ever she will make to me
therefor i accept and will serv you and your caus that seem nobl
faithfulli to the end o huaracha
then i stretch out my hand to him and so our compact wa seal
on the veri next dai my work began huaracha made me known to hi
captain command them to obei me in all thing which look on me
as half divin thei did readili enough
now of soldier i knew littl who wa a seaman bred yet as i had
learn a man of the english race in howev strang a countri he find
himself can make a path there to hi end
moreov in london i had heard much talk of armi and their order
and often watch troop at their exercis also i know how to handl
bow and sword and wa accustom to the manag of men so put
all these memori togeth i set myself to the task of turn a
mob of halfsavag fellow with arm into an order host i creat
regiment and offic them with the best captain that i could find
collect in each regiment so far as possibl the peopl of a certain
town or district these compani i drill and exercis teach them
to us such weapon as thei had to the best purpos
also i caus them to shape stronger bow on the model of my own with
which i had shot the three frenchmen far awai at hast that as it
wa said onc had been the battlebow of thorgrimm the norseman
my ancestor as the sword waveflam wa hi battlesword when these
chanca saw how far and with what a good aim i could shoot with thi
bow thei strove dai and night to learn to equal me though it is
true thei never did also i better their bodyarmour of quilt by
set sheet of leather sinc in that countri there is no iron
taken from the hide of wild anim and of their longhair nativ
sheep between the layer of cotton other thing i did also too mani
and long to record
the end of it wa that within three month huaracha had an armi of some
fifti thousand men who if not well train still kept disciplin and
could move in regiment who knew also how to shoot with their bow and
to us their copperhead spear and ax of that metal or of hard
stone to the best purpos
then at length came the yunca to join us thirti or forti thousand of
them wild fellow and brave enough but undisciplin with these i
could do littl sinc time wa lack save send some of the offic
whom i had train to teach their chief and captain what thei were
abl
thu i wa emploi from dawn till dark and often after it in talk with
huaracha and hi gener or in draw plan with ink that i found a
mean to make upon parchment of sheepskin and note down number and
other thing a sight at which these peopl who knew noth of write
marvel veri much great were my labour yet in them i found more
happi than i had known sinc that fatal dai when i the rich
london merchant hubert of hast had stood befor the altar of st
margaret church with blanch alei inde everi cranni of my time
and mind be thu fill with thing finish or attempt i forgot
my great loneli as an alien in a strang land and onc more becam
as i had been when i traffick in the cheap
but toil as i would i could not forget quilla dure the dai i might
mask her memori in it urgent busi but when i lai down to rest she
seem to come to me as a ghost might do and to stand by my bed look
at me with sad and long ey so real wa her presenc that sometim
i began to believ that she must have di to the world and wa in truth
a ghost or els that she had found the power to throw her soul afar
as it is said certain of these indian folk if so thei should be call
can do at least there she seem to be while i remain awak and
afterward when i slept and i know not whether her strang compani
joi or pain me more for ala she could not talk to me or tell me
how it fare with her and to speak truth now that she wa the wife of
anoth man as i suppos i desir to forget her if i could
for of quilla no word reach us we heard that she had come safe to
cuzco and after that noth more of her marriag there wa no tide
inde she seem to have vanish awai certain of huaracha spi
report to him howev that the great armi which urco had gather to
attack him had been partli disband which seem to show that the inca
no longer prepar for immedi war onli then what had happen to
quilla whose person wa the price of peac perhap she wa hidden
awai dure the prepar for her nuptial at least i could think
of noth els unless inde she had chosen to kill herself or di
natur
soon howev all new ceas for huaracha shut hi frontier hope
that thu urco might not learn that he wa gather armi
at length when our forc were almost readi to march kari came kari
whom i thought lost
on night when i wa seat at my work by lamplight write down
number upon a parchment a shadow fell across it and look up i saw
kari stand befor me travelworn and weari but kari without doubt
unless i dream
have you food lord he ask while i stare at him i need it and
would eat befor i speak
i found meat and nativ beer and brought them to him for it wa late
and my servant were asleep wait till he had fill himself for by
thi time i had learn someth of the patienc of these peopl at
length he spoke sai
huaracha watch is good and to pass it i must journei far into the
mountain and sleep three night without food amid their snow
whenc come you i ask
from cuzco lord
then what of the ladi quilla doe she still live is she wed to urco
she live or live fourteen dai ago and she is not wed but where
she is no man mai ever come you have look your last upon the ladi
quilla lord
if she live and is unw why i ask trembl
becaus she is number among the virgin of the sun our father and
therefor inviol to man were i the inca though i love you and know
all should you attempt to take her ye even you i would kill you if
i could and with my own sword in our land lord there is on crime
which ha no forgiv and that is to lai hand upon a virgin of the
sun we believ lord that if thi is done great curs will fall upon
our countri while as for the man who work the crime befor he pass
to etern vengeanc he and all hi hous and the town whenc he came
must perish utterli and that fals virgin who ha betrai our father
the sun must die slowli and by fire
ha thi ever chanc i ask
histori doe not tell it lord sinc none have been so wick but
such is the law
i thought to myself that it wa a veri evil law and cruel also that i
would break it if i found opportun but made no answer know when
to be silent and that i might as well strive to move a mountain from
it base as to turn kari from the blind of hi folli bred of fals
faith after all could i blame him see that we held the same of
the sacred of nun and it wa said kill them if thei broke their
vow
what new kari i ask
much lord hearken disguis as a peasant who had come into thi
countri to barter wool from a villag near to cuzco i join myself to
the train of the inca upanqui among whose lord i found a friend who
had love me in past year and kept my secret as he wa bound to do
have pass into the brotherhood of knight with me while we were
lad through him in place of a man who wa sick i becam on of the
bearer of the ladi quilla litter and thu wa alwai about her and
at time had speech with her in secret for she knew me again
notwithstand my disguis and uniform so i becam on of those who
wait on her when she at and note all that pass
after the first dai the inca upanqui he who is my father and whose
law heir i am although he discard me for urco and believ me
dead made it a habit to take hi food in the same tent or resthous
chamber as the ladi quilla lord be veri clever she set herself to
charm him so that soon he began to dote upon her as old wornout men
sometim do upon young and beauti women she too pretend to grow
fond of him and at last told him in so mani word that she griev it
wa not he that she wa to marri whose wisdom she hung upon in place of
a princ who she heard wa not wise thi she said becaus she knew
well that the inca would never marri ani more and inde had live alon
for year still be flatter he told her it wa hard that she
should be forc to wed on to whom she had no mind whereon she prai
him even with tear to save her from such a fate at last he vow
that he would do so by set her among the virgin of the sun on whom
no man mai look she thank him and said that she would consid the
matter sinc for reason that you mai guess lord she did not desir
to becom a virgin of the sun and to pass the rest of her dai in prayer
and the weav of the inca garment
so it went on until when we were a dai march from cuzco urco my
brother came to meet hi promis bride now urco is a huge man and
hideou on whom none would believ to have been born of the inca
blood coars he is and dissolut given to drink also though a great
fighter and brave in battl and quickbrain when he is sober i wa
present when thei met and i saw the ladi quilla shiver and turn pale
at the sight of him while he on hi part devour her beauti with hi
ey thei spoke but few word togeth yet befor these were done
he told her it wa hi will that thei should be wed at onc on the dai
after she came to cuzco nor would he listen to the inca upanqui who
said be cun and wish to gain time that due prepar must
be made for so great a busi
thereupon urco grew angri with hi father who both fear and love
him and answer that be almost inca thi matter wa on which he
would settl for himself so fierc wa he that upanqui becam afraid
and went awai when thei were alon urco strove to embrac quilla but
she fled from him and hid with her maiden in a privat place after
thi at the feast urco took too much drink accord to hi custom and
wa led awai to sleep by hi lord then quilla wait upon the inca and
said
o inca i have seen the princ and i claim your promis to save me
from him o inca abandon all thought of marriag i will becom the
bride of our father the sun
upanqui who wa wroth with urco becaus he had cross hi will swore
by the sun itself that he would not fail her come what might sinc
urco should learn that he wa not yet inca
what happen then i ask stare him in the ey
after thi lord when we were halt befor make the state entri
into cuzco for a moment the ladi quilla found opportun for privat
speech with me thi is what she said
tell my father king huaracha that i have fulfil hi oath but
that i cannot marri urco therefor i seek refug in the arm of the
sun as the oracl rimac foretold that i should do have to choos
between thi fate and that of death tell my lordfromthesea what ha
befallen me and bid him farewel to me still sai that he must keep a
good heart sinc i do not believ that all is end between us
then we were part and i saw her no more
and did you hear no more kari
i heard much lord i heard that when urco learn that the ladi quilla
had vanish awai into the hous of virgin whither he might not come
and that he wa rob of the bride whom he desir he grew mad with
rage inde of thi i saw someth myself two dai later with
thousand of other i wa in the great squar in front of the templ
of the sun where the inca upanqui sat in state upon a golden throne to
receiv the prais of hi peopl upon hi safe return after hi long and
hard journei and as some report to lai down hi lordship in favour
of urco also to tell the peopl that the danger of war with the chanca
had pass awai scarc had the ceremoni begun when urco appear at
the head of a number of lord and princ of the inca blood who ar of
hi clan and i notic that he wa drunk and furiou he advanc to
the foot of the throne almost without obeis and shout
where is the ladi quilla daughter of huaracha who is promis to me
in marriag inca why have you hidden her awai inca
becaus the sun our father ha claim her as hi bride and ha
taken her to dwell in hi holi hous where never again mai the ey of
man behold her princ answer upanqui
you mean that rob me you have taken her for yourself inca
shout urco again
then upanqui stood up and swore by the sun that thi wa not so and
that what he had done wa done by the decre of the god and at the
prayer of the ladi quilla who have seen urco had declar that
either she would be wed to the god or die by her own hand which would
bring the vengeanc of the sun upon the peopl
then urco went mad he rave at the inca and while all present shiver
with fear he curs the sun our father ye even when a cloud came up
in the clear sky and veil the face of the god heedless of the omen
he continu hi curs and blasphemi moreov he said that soon he
would be inca and that then if he must tear the hous of virgin stone
from stone as inca he would drag forth the ladi quilla and make her hi
wife
now at these word upanqui stood up and rent hi robe
must my ear be outrag with such blasphemi he cri know son
urco that thi dai i wa mind to take off the royal fring and to set
it on your head crown you inca in my place while i withdrew to
pass the remaind of my dai at yucai in peac and prayer my will is
chang thi i shall not do my life is not done and strength return
to my mind and bodi here i stai as inca now i see that i am punish
for my sin
what sin shout urco
the sin of set you befor my eldest law son kari whose wife
you stole kari whom also it is said you poison and who at least ha
vanish and is doubtless dead
now lord when i kari heard thi my heart melt in me and i wa
mind to declar myself to upanqui my father but while i weigh the
matter for a moment know that if i did so such word as these might
well be my last sinc urco had mani of is follow present who perhap
would fall upon and kill me suddenli my father upanqui fell forward
in a swoon hi lord and physician bore him awai urco follow and
present the multitud depart thi wai and that afterward we were
told that the inca had recov but must not be disturb for mani
dai
did you hear more of quilla kari
ye lord he answer grave it wa commonli report that
through some priestess in hi pai urco had poison her sai that as
she had chosen the sun as husband to the sun she would go
poison her i mutter wellnigh fall to the ground poison

ay lord but be comfort for thi wa addedthat she who gave
the poison wa taken in the act by her who is name the mother of the
virgin and hand over to the women who cast her into the den of
serpent where she perish scream that it wa urco who had forc
her to the deed
that doe not comfort me man what of quilla did she die
lord it is said not it is said that the mother of the virgin dash
awai the cup as it touch her lip but thi is said also that some of
the poison flew into her ey and blind her
i groan for the thought of quilla blind wa horribl
again take comfort lord sinc perchanc she mai recov from thi
blind also i wa told that although she can see noth her
beauti is not mar that the venom inde ha made her ey seem
larger and more love even than thei were befor
i made no answer who fear that kari wa deceiv me or perhap wa
himself deceiv and that quilla wa dead present he continu hi
stori in the same quiet even voic sai
lord after thi i sought out certain of my friend who had love me in
my youth and my mother also while she live reveal myself to them
we made plan togeth but befor aught could be done in earnest it
wa need that i should see my father upanqui while i wa wait
till he had recov from the stroke that fell upon him some spy
betrai me to urco who search for me to kill me and wellnigh found
me the end of it wa that i wa forc to fly though befor i did so
mani swore themselv to my caus who would escap from the tyranni of
urco moreov it wa agre that if i return with soldier at my
back thei and their follow would come out to join me to the number
of thousand and help me to take my own again so that i mai be inca
after upanqui my father therefor i have come back here to talk with
you and huaracha
such is my tale
chapter viii
the field of blood
when on the morrow huaracha king of the chanca heard all thi stori
and that urco had given poison to hi daughter quilla who if she still
live at all did so it wa said as a blind woman a kind of mad
took hold of him
now let war come i will not rest or stai he cri till i see
thi hound urco dead and hang up hi skin stuf with straw as an
offer to hi own god the sun
yet it wa you king huaracha who sent the ladi quilla to thi urco
for your own purpos said kari in hi quiet fashion
who and what ar you that reprov me ask huaracha turn on him
i onli know you as the servant or slave of the whitelordfromthesea
though it is true i have heard stori concern you he ad
i am kari the firstborn law son of upanqui and by right heir to
the inca throne no less o huaracha urco my brother rob me of my
wife as through the folli of my father upon whose heart urco mother
work he had alreadi rob me of my inherit then to make sure
he strove to poison me as he ha poison your daughter with a
poison that would make me mad and incap of rule yet leav me
livingbecaus he fear lest the curs of the sun should fall upon
him if he murder me i recov from that bane and wander to a far
land now i have return to take my own if i am abl all that i sai i
can prove to you
for a while huaracha stare at him astonish then said
and if you prove it what do you ask of me o kari
the help of your armi to enabl me to overthrow urco who is veri
strong be the command of the quichua host
and if your tale be true and urco is overthrown what do you promis me
in return
the independ of the chanca peopl who otherwis must soon be
destroi and certain other ad territori which you covet while i
am inca
and with thi my daughter if she still live ask huaracha look
at him
nai repli kari firmli as to the ladi quilla i promis noth
she ha vow herself to my father the sun and what i have alreadi told
the lord hurachi here who love her i tell you henceforward no man
mai look upon her who is the bride of the sun for if i suffer thi
certainli the curs of the sun would fall upon me and upon my peopl
he who lai a hand upon her i will strive to slayher he look at me
with meaningbecaus i must or be accurst take all els but let the
ladi quilla be what the sun ha he hold forev
perhap the moon her mother mai have someth to sai in that
matter said huaracha gloomili still let it lie for the while
then thei fell to discuss the term of their allianc and when it
came to battl what help kari could bring from among those who clung to
him in cuzco
after thi huaracha took me to anoth chamber where we debat the
busi
thi kari if he be kari himself is a bigot he said and if he ha
hi wai neither you nor i will ever set ey on quilla again becaus
to him it is sacrileg so what sai you
i answer that it would be best to make an allianc with kari whom
i knew to be honest and no pretend sinc without hi help i did not
think that it would be possibl to defeat the armi of the peopl of
the inca for the rest we must trust to chanc make no promis as
to quilla
if we did thei would avail littl said huaracha see that without
doubt she is dead and onli vengeanc remain to us there is more poison
in cuzco white lord
eight dai later we were march on cuzco a great host of us
number at least forti thousand chanca and twentyf thousand of
the rebelli yunca who had join our standard
on we march by the great road over mountain and across plain
drive with us numberless herd of the nativ sheep for food but
meet no man sinc so soon as we were out of the territori of the
chanca all fled at our approach at length on night we camp upon a
hill name carmenca and saw beneath us at a distanc the mighti citi of
cuzco stand in a vallei through which a river ran there it wa with
it huge fortress built of great block of stone it templ it
palac it open squar and it countless street border by low
hous moreov beyond and around it we saw other thing name the
camp of a vast armi dot with thousand of white tent
urco is readi for us said kari to me grimli as he point to these
tent
we camp upon the hill carmenca and that night there came to us an
embassi which spoke in the name of upanqui and urco as though thei
reign jointli thi embassi of great lord who all wore disc of
gold in their ear ask us what wa our purpos huaracha answeredto
aveng the murder of the ladi quilla hi daughter that he heard had
been poison by urco
how know you that she is dead ask the spokesman
if she is not dead repli huaracha show her to us
that mai not be repli the spokesman sinc if she live it is in
the hous of the virgin of the sun whenc none come out and where none
go in hearken o huaracha go back whenc you came or the countless
armi of the inca will fall upon you and destroi you you and your
hand togeth
that is yet to be seen answer huaracha and without more word the
embassi withdrew
that night also men crept into our camp secretli who were of the parti
of kari of quilla thei seem to know noth for none spoke of those
over whom the veil of the sun had fallen thei told us howev that
the old inca upanqui wa still in cuzco and had recov somewhat
from hi sick also thei said that now the feud between him and urco
wa bitter but that urco had the upper hand and wa still in command of
the armi these armi thei declar were immens and would fight us
on the morrow ad howev that certain regiment of them who were
of the parti of kari would desert to us in the battl lastli thei
said that there wa great fear in cuzco sinc none knew how that battl
would end which wa understood by all to be on for the dominion of
tavantinsuyu
thei had noth more to sai except that thei prai the sun for our
success to save them from the tyranni of urco thi princ it appear
suspect their conspiraci for now the rumour that kari live wa
everywher and have obtain the name of some who were connect
with it through hi spi he pursu them with murder and sudden death
thei were poison at their food thei were stab as thei walk
through the street at night their wive if young and fair vanish
awai as thei believ into the hous of those who desir them even
their children were kidnap doubtless to becom the servant of
whom thei knew not thei had complain of these thing to the old
inca upanqui but without avail sinc in such matter he wa powerless
befor urco who had command of the armi therefor thei would even
welcom the triumph of huaracha which meant that kari would becom inca
if with lessen territori
befor thei part to plai their part kari brought them befor me
whom in their foolish thei worship believ me to be in truth a
god then he told them to have no fear sinc i would command the armi
of huaracha in the battl
have survei the ground while the light last for the most of that
night togeth with huaracha and kari i toil make plan for
the great fight that wa to come all be readi i lai down to sleep
awhil wonder whether it were the last time i should do so upon the
earth and to tell the truth not care overmuch who believ that
quilla wa dead had it not been for my sin which weigh upon me with
none to whom i might confess them should have been glad to leav the
world and it troubl for whatev might lie beyond even if it were
but sleep
there come a time to most men when abov everyth thei desir rest
and now that hour wa with me the exil and the desol here in thi
strang countri and among these alien peopl i had found on soul which
wa akin to mine that of a beauti woman who love me and whom i
had come to love and desir but what wa the end of it ow to the
necess of statecraft and her own nobl she had been separ
from me and although as it would seem she had as yet escap
defil wa spirit awai into the templ of some barbar worship
where i wa almost sure death had found her
at the best she wa blind and where she lai in her dark no man
might come becaus of the superstit of these folk even if kari
becam inca it would not help me or her should she still live sinc
he wa the fiercest bigot of them all and swore that he would kill me
hi friend rather than that i should touch her the vow to hi fals
god
or perhap through the priest to save himself such sorrow he
would kill her at the least dead or not she wa lost to me while
iutterli alonemust fight for a caus in which i had but on concern
to bring some savag princ to hi end becaus of hi crime against
quilla and if thing went well and thi chanc what of the futur
of what us to me were reward that i did not want and the worship of
the vulgar which i hate rather would i have live out my life as the
humblest fisherman on hast beach than be made a king over these
glitter barbarian with their gold and gem which could bui noth
that i need not even a book of hour to feed my soul or the sound of
the english tongu to comfort my empti heart
at length i fell asleep and as it seem but a few minut later
though realli six hour had gone by wa awaken by kari who told
me that the dawn wa not far off and came to help me to buckl on my
armour then i went forth and togeth with huaracha arrang our armi
for battl our plan wa to advanc from our rise ground across a
great plain beneath us which wa call xaqui but afterward becam
known by the name of yahuarpampa or field of blood
thi plain lai between us and the citi of cuzco and my thought wa that
we would march or fight our wai across it and rush into the citi which
wa unwal and there amidst it street and hous await the attack
of the inca host that were encamp upon it farther side for thu
protect by their wall we hope that we should be more equal to them
yet thing happen otherwis sinc with the first light without which
we did not dare to move over unknown ground we perceiv that dure
the dark the inca armi had move round and through the town and
were gather by the ten thousand in dens battalion upon the farther
side of the plain
now we took council togeth and in the end decid not to attack as we
had propos but to await their onslaught on the rocki ridg up which
thei must climb so we command that our armi which wa marshal
in three divis abreast and two wing with the yunca as a reserv
behind should eat and make readi in the centr of our main divis
which number some fifteen thousand of the chanca troop and a littl
in front of it wa a low long hill upon the highest point of which
i took my place stand upon a rock with a group of captain and
messeng behind me and a guard of about a thousand pick men mass
upon the slope and around the hill from thi high point i could see
everyth and in my glitter armour wa visibl to all friend and
foe togeth
after a paus dure which the priest of the chanca and of the yunca
behind us sacrif sheep to the moon and the mani other god thei
worship and those of the quichua as i could see from my rock made
prayer and offer to the rise sun with a mighti shout the inca
host began to advanc across the plain toward us reckon them with
my ey i saw that thei outnumb us by two or three to on inde
their hord seem to be countless and alwai more of them came on
behind from the dim recess of the citi divid into three great
armi thei crept across the plain a wild and gorgeou spectacl
the sunlight shine upon the forest of their spear and on their rich
barbar uniform
a furlong or more awai thei halt and took counsel point to me with
their spear as though thei fear me we stood quit still though
some of our gener urg that we should charg but thi i counsel
huaracha not to do who desir that the quichua should break their
strength upon us at length some word wa given the splendid rainbow
banner of the inca wa unfurl and still divid into three armi
with a wide stretch of plain between each of them thei attack yell
like all the fiend of hell
now thei had reach us and there began the most terribl battl that
wa told of in the histori of that land wave after wave of them roll
up against us but our battalion which i had not train in vain stood
like rock and slew and slew and slew till the dead could be count by
the thousand again and again thei strove to storm the hill on which i
stood hope to kill me and each time we beat them back pick out
their gener i loos shaft after shaft from my long bow and seldom
did i miss nor could their cottonquilt armour turn those bitter
arrow
the shaft of the god the shaft of the god thei cri and shrank
back from befor me
there appear a man with a yellow fillet on hi head and a robe that
wa stud with preciou stone a huge man with great limb and
flame ey a loosemouth hideou man who wield a big ax of
copper and carri a bow longer than ani i had seen in that land
hook the ax to hi belt he set an arrow on the bow and let drive at
me it sped true and struck me full upon the breast onli to shatter on
the good french mail which copper could not pierc
again he shot and thi time the arrow glanc from my helm then i drew
on him and my shaft that i had aim at hi head cut awai the fring
about hi brow and carri it far awai at thi sight a groan went up
from the lord about him and on cri
an omen o urco an evil omen
ay he shout for the white wizard who shot the arrow
drop the bow he rush up the hill at me roar ax aloft and
follow by hi compani he smote and i caught the blow upon my shield
and strike back with waveflam shore through the shaft of the ax
that he had lift to guard hi head as though it had been made of reed
ay and through the quilt cotton on hi shoulder strengthen with
strip of gold and to the bone beneath
then a man slip past me it wa kari strike at urco with deleroi
sword thei close and roll down the slope lock in each other
arm what chanc after thi i do not know for other rush in and
all grew confus but present kari limp back somewhat shaken and
bleed and i caught sight of urco littl hurt as it seem amidst
hi lord at the bottom of the slope
at thi moment i heard a great shout and look round saw that the
quichua had broken through our left and were slaughter mani while
the rest fled also that our right wa waver i sent messeng to
huaracha bid him call up the yunca rear guard thei were slow in
come and i began to fear that all wa lost for littl by littl the
hord of the men of cuzco were surround us
then it wa that kari or some with him lift a banner that had been
wrap upon a pole a blue banner upon which wa embroid a
golden sun at the sight of it there wa tumult in the inca rank and
present a great bodi of men five or six thousand of them that had
seem to be in reserv ran forward shout kari kari and fell
upon those who were pursu our shatter left break them up and
dispers them also at last the yunca came up and drove back the
regiment that assail our right while from urco armi there rose a
cry of treacheri
trumpet blew and the inca host gather itself togeth and
abandon it dead and wound drew back sullenli on to the plain and
there halt in three bodi as befor though much lessen in number
huaracha appear sai
strike white lord it is our hour the heart is out of them
the signal wa given and roar like a hurrican present the
chanca charg down the slope thei went i at the head of them with
huaracha on on side and kari on the other the swiftfoot chanca
outran me who wa hinder by my mail we charg in three mass as we
had stood on the ridg follow those open lane of ground up which
the foe had not come becaus these were less cumber with dead and
wound present i saw why those of cuzco had left these lane untrod
for of a sudden some warrior who had outstrip me vanish thei
had fallen into a pit cover over with earth laid upon cane of which
the bottom wa set with sharp stake other who were run along
the lane of open ground to right and left also fell into pit of which
there were score all carefulli prepar against the dai of battl
with troubl the chanca were halt but not befor we had lost some
hundr of men then we advanc again across that ground over which
the inca host had retreat
at length we reach their line pass through a storm of arrow and
there began such a battl as i had never heard of or even dream with
ax stonehead club and spear both armi fought furious
and though the inca still outnumb us by two to on becaus of my
train our regiment drove them back lord after lord rush at me
with glare ey but my mail turn their copper spear and knive
of flint oh waveflam fed full that dai and if thorgrimm my
forefath could have seen us from hi home in valhalla sure he must
have sworn by odin that never had he given it such a feast
the inca warrior grew afraid and shrank back
thi redbeard from the sea is inde a god he cannot be slain i
heard them cry
then urco appear bloodi and furiou shout
coward i will show you whether he cannot be slain
he rush onward to meetnot me but huaracha who see that i wa
weari had leapt in front of me thei fought and huaracha went down and
wa drag awai by some of hi servant
now urco and i were face to face he wield a huge copperhead club
with which as my mail could not be pierc he thought to batter out
my life i caught the blow upon my shield but so great wa the giant
strength that it brought me to my knee next second i wa up and at
him shout i smote with both hand for my shield had fallen the
thick turbanlik headdress that urco wore wa sever cut through as
the ax had been and waveflam bit deep into the skull beneath
urco fell like a stun ox and i sprang upon him to make an end then
it wa that a rope wa flung about my shoulder a noos rope that wa
haul tight in vain i struggl i wa thrown down i wa seiz by a
score of hand and drag awai into the heart of urco host
wait till a litter could be brought thei set me on my feet again my
arm still bound by the noos that these indian call laso which thei
know so well how to throw the red sword waveflam still hang by it
thong from my right wrist whilst i stood thu like a bull in a net
thei gather round stare at me not with hate as it seem to me
but in fear and with rever when at length the litter came thei
aid me to enter it quit gentli
as i did so i look back the battl still rage but it seem to me
with less furi than befor it wa as though both side were weari of
slaughter their leader be fallen the litter wa born forward
till at length the nois of shout and tumult grew low twist
myself round i peer through the back curtain and saw that the inca
host and that of the chanca were separ sullenli neither of them
broken sinc thei carri their wound awai with them it wa plain
that the battl remain drawn for there wa no rout and no triumph
i saw too that i wa enter the great citi of cuzco where women
and children stood at the door of the hous gaze and some of them
wring their hand with tear upon their face
pass down long street and across a bridg i came to a vast squar
round which stood mighti build low massiv and construct of
huge stone at the door of on of these the litter halt and i wa
help to descend men beautifulli clad in broider linen led me
through a gatewai and across a garden where i note a marvel thing
name that all the plant therein were fashion of solid gold with
silver flower or sometim of silver with golden flower also there
were tree on which were perch bird of gold and silver when i saw
thi i thought that i must be mad but it wa not so for have no
other us for the preciou metal of which thei had so much abund
thu did these inca adorn their palac
leav the golden garden i reach a courtyard surround by room
to on of which i wa conduct pass it door i found myself in a
splendid chamber hung with tapestri fantast wrought and have
cushion seat and tabl of rich wood incrust with preciou
stone here servant or slave appear with a chamberlain who bow
deepli and welcom me in the name of the inca
then as though i were someth half divin gentli enough thei loos
the sword from my wrist took the long bow from my back with the few
arrow that remain also my dagger and hid them awai thei unbound
me and free me from my armour as i told them how and the garment
beneath lave me with warm scent water rub my bruis limb and
cloth me in wonder soft garment also scent and fasten about
my middl with a golden belt thi done food and spice drink of their
nativ wine were brought to me in golden vessel i at and drank and
be veri weari laid myself down upon on of the couch to sleep
for now i no longer took ani thought as to what might befal me but
receiv all as it came good and ill togeth entrust my bodi and
soul to the care of god and st hubert inde what els could i do who
wa disarm and a prison
when i awok again veri stiff and bruis but much refresh night
had fallen for hang lamp were lit about the room by their light
i saw the chamberlain of whom i have spoken stand befor me i ask
him hi errand with mani bow he said that if i were rest the inca
upanqui desir my presenc that he might speak with me
i bade him lead on and with other who wait without he conduct
me through a maze of passag into a gloriou chamber where everyth
seem to be gold for even the wall were panel with it never had
i dreamt of so much gold inde the sight of it weari me till i could
have welcom that of humbl brick or wood at the end of thi chamber
that wa also lit with lamp were curtain present these were drawn
by two beauti women in jewel skirt and headdress and behind
them on a dai i saw a couch and on the couch the old inca upanqui
look feebler than when i had last beheld him in the chanca citi
and veri simpli clad in a white tunic onli on hi head he wore the red
fring from which i suppos he never part dai or night he look up
and said
greet whitelordfromthesea so you have come to visit me after
all though you said that you would not
i have been brought to visit you inca i answer
ye ye thei tell me thei captur you in the battl though i expect
that wa by your own will as you had weari of those chanca for what
laso can hold a god
none i answer boldli
of cours not and that you ar a kind of god there is no doubt becaus
of the thing you did in that battl thei sai that the arrow and
spear melt when thei touch you and that you shot and cut down men
by score also that when the princ urco tri to kill you although
he is the strongest man in my kingdom you knock him over as though
he had been a littl child and hack hi head open so that thei do not
know whether he will live or die i think i hope he will die for you
see i have quarrel with him
i thought to myself that so did i but i onli ask
how did the battl end inca
as it began lord hurachi a great mani men have been kill on
both side thousand and thousand of them and neither armi ha the
victori thei have drawn back and sit growl at each other like two
angri lion which ar afraid to fight again inde i do not want them
to fight and now that urco cannot interfer i shall put a stop to all
thi bloodsh if i am abl tell me for you were with him why doe
thi huaracha who i hear is also wound want to make war on me with
those troublesom chanca of hi
becaus your son the princ urco ha poison or tri to poison
hi onli child quilla
ye ye i know and it wa a wick thing to do you see lord what
happen wa thi that love quilla who is fairer than her mother the
moon wa to have marri urco but lord as it chanc on our journei
togeth although i am oldwel she becam enamour of me and
prai me to protect her from urco such thing happen to women lord
whose heart when thei behold the divin ar apt to carri them awai
from the vulgar and he laugh in a silli fashion like the vain old
fool that he wa
natur how could she help it inca who after see you would
wish to turn to urco
no on especi as urco is a coars and brutal fellow well what
wa i to do there ar reason why i do not wish to marri again at my
ag inde i am tire of the sight of women who want time to prai and
think of holi thing also if i had done what she wish some might
have thought that i had behav badli to urco at the same time a
woman heart is sacr and i could not do violenc to that of on so
sweet and understand and love so i put her into the hous of the
virgin of the sun where she will be quit safe
it seem that she wa not safe inca
no becaus that violent man urco be disappoint and veri
jealou through some low creatur of hi who wait on the virgin
tri to poison her with a drug which would have made her all swollen
and hideou and cover her face with blotch also perhap have sent
her mad luckili on of the matron whom we call mamacona knock
the cup awai befor she drank but some of the horribl poison went into
her ey and blind her
so she live inca
certainli she live i have learnt that for myself becaus in thi
countri it is not wise to trust what thei tell you you know as inca i
have privileg and although even i do not talk to them i caus those
virgin of the sun to be led in front of me which in strict even
i ought not to have done it wa a dreari busi lord hurachi for
though those virgin mai be so holi some of them ar veri old and
hideou and of cours quilla as a novic came last in the line conduct
by two mamacona who ar cousin of my own the odd thing is that the
poison seem to have made her much more beauti than befor for her
ey have grown bigger and ar gloriou shine like star seen when
there is frost well there she is safe from urco and everi other man
howev wick and impiou but what doe thi huaracha want
he want hi blind daughter back inca
imposs imposs who ever heard of such a thing why heaven and
earth would come togeth and the sun my father and her husband
would burn us all up still perhap we could come to an agreement for
huaracha must have had enough fight and veri like he will die
now i am tire of talk about the ladi quilla and i want to ask you
someth
speak on inca
suddenli the old dotard manner chang he becam quick and shrewd as
doubtless he wa in hi prime for thi upanqui had been a great king
at the begin of our talk the two women of whom i have spoken and the
chamberlain had withdrawn to the end of the chamber where thei wait
with their hand fold like those who ador befor an altar still he
peer about him to make sure that none were within hear and in the
end beckon to me to ascend the dai and sit upon the couch besid him
sai
you see i trust you although you ar a god from the sea who ha been
fight against me now hearken you had a servant with you a veri
strang man who is said also to have come out of the sea though that i
cannot believ sinc he is like on of our princ where is that man
with the armi of huaracha inca
so i have heard i heard also that in the battl he hoist a banner
with the sun blazon on it and that thereon certain regiment of mine
desert to huaracha now why did thei do that
i understand o inca that the king of thi land have mani children
perhap he might be on of them
ah you ar clever as a god should be well i am a god also and the
same thought ha come to me although as a fact i have onli had two
legitim son and the other ar of no account the eldest of these
wa an abl and beauti princ name kari but we quarrel and to
tell the truth there wa a woman in the matter or rather two women for
kari mother fought with urco mother whom i love becaus she never
scold me which the other did so urco wa name to be inca after me
yet that wa not enough for him who remain jealou of hi brother kari
who outpass him in all thing save strength of bodi thei woo the
same beauti woman and kari won her whereon urco seduc her from
him and afterward he or someon kill her at least she di i
forget how then the lord of the inca blood began to turn toward kari
becaus he wa royal and wise which would have meant civil war when i
had been gather to the sun therefor urco poison him or so it wa
rumour at ani rate he vanish awai and often sinc then i have
mourn him
the dead come to life again sometim inca

to kari that he might be the same man grown older andwhi did those
regiment all of them offic by men who us to love kari go over
to huaracha todai and why do rumour run through the land like the
wind that spring up suddenli in fine weather tell me of thi servant
of your and how you found him in the sea
why should i tell you inca is it becaus you want to kill him who is
so like to thi lost kari of your
no nogod can keep each other counsel can thei not it is becaus
i would giveoh half my godship to know that he is aliv hark you
urco weari me so much that sometim i wonder whether he realli is my
son who can tell there wa a certain lord of the coastland a hairi
giant who thei said could eat half a sheep at a sit and break the
back of men in hi hand of whom urco mother us to think much
but who can tell no on except my father the sun and he guard hi
secretsfor the present at least urco weari me with hi coars
crime and hi drunken though the armi love him becaus he is a
butcher and liber we quarrel the other dai over the small matter
of thi ladi quilla and he threaten me till i grew wrath and said
that i would not hand him my crown as i had purpos to do ye i
grew wrath and hate him for whose sake i had sin becaus hi mother
bewitch me lordfromthesea here hi voic drop to a whisper

chapter ix
kari come to hi own
when i awok on the follow morn in the splendid chamber of which i
have spoken it wa to find that my armour and arm had been restor to
me and veri glad wa i to see waveflam again after i had eaten and
escort by servant walk in the garden for never could i be left
alon marvel at the wondrou golden fruit and flower a messeng
came to me sai that the villaorna desir speech with me i
wonder who thi villaorna might be but when he enter i saw that
he wa larico that same sternfac cunningei lord who had been the
spokesman of the inca when he visit the citi of the chanca also i
learn that villaorna wa hi titl and meant chief priest
we bow to each other and all were sent from the chamber leav us
quit alon
lordfromthesea he said the inca send me hi councillor and
blood rel who am head priest of the sun to desir that you will
go on an embassi for him to the camp of the chanca first howev it
is need that you should swear by the sun that you will return thenc
to cuzco will you do thi
now as there wa noth i desir more than to return to cuzco where
quilla wa i answer that i would swear by my own god by the sun and
by my sword unless the chanca detain me by forc further i prai
him to set out hi busi
he did so in these word
lord we have come to know it matter not how that the man who
appear with you in thi land is no other than kari the elder son of
the inca whom we thought dead now it is in the inca mind and in the
mind of us hi councillor to proclaim the princ kari as heir to
the throne which soon he would be call upon to fill but the matter is
veri danger see that urco still command the armi and mani of
the great lord who ar of hi mother hous cling to him hope to
receiv advanc from him when he becom inca
but priest larico urco thei sai is like to die and if so all thi
troubl will melt like a cloud
your sword bit deep lord but i have it from hi physician that as
the brain is uncut he will not die although he will be sick for a long
while therefor we must act while he is sick sinc it is not law
to bring about hi end even if he could be come at time press lord
for as you have seen the inca is old and feebl and hi mind is weak
inde at time he ha no mind though at other hi strength return to
him
which mean that i deal with you who ar the chief priest and those
behind you i said look him in the ey
that is what it mean lord now hearken while i tell you the truth
after the inca i am the most power man in tavantinsuyu inde for
the most part the inca speak with my voic although i seem to speak
with hi yet i am in a snare heretofor i have support urco becaus
there wa no other who could becom inca although he is a brutal and
an evil man of late howev sinc my return from the citi of the
chanca i have quarrel with urco becaus he ha lost that witch the
ladi quilla whom he desir madli and lai the blame on me and it
ha come to my knowledg that when he succe to the throne it is hi
purpos to kill me which doubtless he will do if he can or at the
least to cast me from my place and power which is as bad as death
therefor i desir to make my peac with kari if he will swear to
continu me in my offic and thi i can onli do through you bring thi
peac about lord and i will promis you anyth you mai wish even
perchanc to the incaship itself should aught happen to kari or should
he refus my offer i think that the quichua might welcom a white god
from the sea who ha shown himself so great a gener and so brave in
battl and who ha knowledg and wisdom more than their to rule over
them he ad reflect onli then lord it would be need to
be rid of kari as well as of urco
to which i would never consent i repli see that he is my
friend with whom i have share mani danger moreov i do not wish to
be inca
is there then anyth els that you wish veri much lord a thought
came to me yonder at the citi of the chanca by the wai how love
is that ladi quilla and how royal a woman it is most strang that she
should have turn her mind toward an ag man like upanqui
we look at each other
veri strang i said it seem to me sad also that thi beauteou
quilla should be immur in a nunneri for life to tell you the truth
highpriest sinc it is not good for man to live alon rather than
that such a thing should have happen i would have marri her myself
to which perchanc she might have consent
again we look at each other and i went on
i hint as much to kari after we heard she wa number amongst the
virgin and ask him whether should he becom inca he would take her
thenc and give her to me
what did he answer lord
he said that though he love me like a brother first he would kill me
with hi own hand sinc such a deed would be sacrileg against the sun
last night also the inca himself said much the same
is it so lord well we priest bring up our inca to think thu if
we did not where would our power be see that we ar the voic of
the sun upon earth and issu hi decre
but do you alwai think thu yourselv o highpriest
not quit alwai there ar loophol in everi law of god and men for
exampl i believ i see on in the instanc of thi ladi quilla but
befor we wast more time in talkingtel me white lord do you desir
her and if so ar you readi to pai me my price it is that you shall
assur to me the friendship of the princ kari should he becom inca
and the continu of my power and offic
my answer is that i do desir thi ladi o highpriest and that if i
can i will obtain from kari the promis of what you seek and now where
is the loophol
i seem to rememb lord that there is an ancient law which saysthat
none who ar maim mai be the wive of the sun it is true that thi
law appli to them befor thei contract the holi marriag still if
the point came up befor me as highpriest i might perhap find that
it appli also to those who were maim after marriag the case is
rare for which preced cannot be found if the search be thorough
now through the wicked of urco as it happen thi ladi quilla ha
been blind and therefor is no longer perfect in her bodi do you
understand
quit but what would upanqui or kari sai the inca you declar ar
alwai bigot and might interpret thi law otherwis
i cannot tell lord but let us ceas from beat bush i will help
you if i can if you will help me if you can though i daresai that in
the end you who ar not a bigot must take the law into your own hand
as perhap the ladi quilla who is a moonworshipp would be will
to do also
the finish of it wa that thi cun priest and statesman and i made a
bargain if i could win kari over to hi interest then he swore by the
sun that he would gain me access to the ladi quilla and help me to fly
with her if so we both wish while i on my part swore to plead hi
caus with kari moreov as he show me there wa littl fear that
either of us would break these oath sinc henceforth each lai in the
power of the other
after thi we pass on to public matter i wa charg to offer an
honour truce to huaracha and the chanca with permiss to them to
camp their armi in certain vallei near to cuzco where thei would
be fed until peac wa declar which peac would give them all thei
need name their freedom and safeguard from attack for the rest
i wa to bring kari and those who had desert to him on the yesterdai
into cuzco where none would molest them
then he went leav me happier than i had been sinc i bade farewel
to quilla for now at last i saw light a faint uncertain light it wa
true onli to be reach if reach at all through mani difficulti
and danger but still light at last i had found someon in thi
land of black superstit who wa not a bigot and who be the
highpriest of the sun knew too much of hi god to fear him or to
believ that he should come down to earth and burn it up should on of
the hundr of hi bride seek anoth husband of cours thi larico
might betrai me and quilla but i did not think he would sinc he had
noth to gain therebi and might have much to lose for the reason
that i wa abl or he thought that i wa abl to set kari against him
at least i could onli go forward and trust to fortun though in fact
hitherto she had never shown me favour where woman wa concern
awhil later i wa be born in on of the inca own litter back to
the camp of the chanca accompani by an embassi of great lord
we pass over that dread bloodstain plain where under a flag of
truce both side were engag in buri the thousand of their dead
and came to the ridg whenc we had charg on the yester morn here
sentri stop us and i descend from my litter when the chanca saw
me in my armour come back to them aliv thei set up a great shout
and present i and the lord with me were led to the pavilion of king
huaracha
we found him ly sick upon a couch for though he show no wound he
had been badli bruis upon the bodi by a blow from urco club and as
i fear wa hurt in the bowel he greet me with delight sinc he
thought that i might have been kill after i wa captur and ask
how i came to appear in hi camp in the compani of our enemi i told
him at onc what had chanc and that i wa sworn to return to cuzco
when i had done my busi then the inca ambassador set out their
propos for a truce and retir while huaracha discuss them with
hi gener and kari who also wa overjoi to see me safe
the end of it wa that thei were accept on the term offer name
that huaracha and hi armi should withdraw to the vallei of which i
have spoken and there camp receiv all the food thei need until
a peac could be offer such as he would be will to accept inde
the chanca were glad to agre to thi plan for their loss in the
battl had been veri great and thei were in no state to renew the attack
upon cuzco which wa still defend by such mighti hord of brave
warrior fight for their home famili and freedom
so all wa agre on the promis that peac should be made within thirti
dai or sooner and that if it were not the war should recomm
then privat i told huaracha all that i had learn about quilla and
that i had still hope of save her though what these were i did not
tell him when he had thought he said that now the fate of quilla must
be left in the hand of the god and mine sinc not even for her could
he neglect the opportun of an honour peac see that anoth
battl might mean destruct also he point out that he wa hurt and
i who had been gener under him wa a prison and bound by my oath to
return to prison so that the chanca had lost their leader
after thi we part i promis to work for hi caus and to come to
see him again if i might
these matter finish i went asid with kari to a place where none
could hear us and there laid befor him the offer of larico the
highpriest show him how the case stood of quilla howev i said
noth to him though it pain me to keep back part of the truth even
from kari yet what wa i to do who knew that if i told him all and he
becam inca or the inca acknowledg heir he would work against me
becaus of hi superstiti mad and perhap caus quilla to
be kill by the priest as on whose feet were set in the path of
sacrileg so on thi matter i held my peac nor did he ask me anyth
concern quilla who i think wish to hear noth of that ladi and
what had befallen her
when he had learn all he said
thi mai be a trap lord i do not trust yonder larico who ha alwai
been my enemi and urco friend
i think he is hi own friend first i answer who know that if
urco recov he will kill him becaus he ha taken the part of your
father upanqui in their quarrel and suspect him
i am not sure said kari yet someth must be risk did i not
tell you when we were sail down the english river that we must put
faith in our god ye afterward also and more than onc and did not
the god save us well now again i trust to my god and draw out
the imag of pachacamac which he wore round hi neck he kiss it
then turn bow and prai to the sun
i will come with you he said when he had finish hi devot to
live to be inca or to die as the sun decre
so he came and with him some of hi friend captain of those who had
desert to him in the battl but the five thousand soldier or those
who were left of them did not come as yet becaus thei fear lest thei
should be set upon and butcher by the regiment of urco
that night when we were back safe in cuzco kari and the highpriest
larico talk togeth in secret of what pass between them he onli
told me that thei had come to an agreement which satisfi them both
larico said the same to me when next i saw him ad
you have kept your word and serv my turn lordfromthesea
therefor i will keep mine and serv your when the time come yet be
warn by me and sai noth of a certain ladi to the princ kari sinc
when i spoke a word to him on the matter hint that her surrend to
her father huaracha would make peac with him more easi and last he
answer that first would he fight huaracha and the yunca as well to
the last man in cuzco
to the sun she ha gone he said and with the sun she must stai
lest the curs of the sun and of pachacamac the spirit abov the sun
should fall on me and all of us
larico told me also that fear someth the great lord who were
of urco parti had born him awai in a litter to a strong citi in the
mountain about five leagu from cuzco escort by thousand of pick
men who would stai in and about that citi
on the next morn i wa summon to wait upon the inca upanqui
and went wear my armour i found him in the same great chamber as
befor onli now he wa more royal arrai and with him were sundri
of hi high lord of the inca blood also certain priest among them
the villaorna larico
the old king who on that dai seem clear in hi mind and well greet
me in hi kindli fashion and bade me set out all that had pass between
me and huaracha in the chanca camp thi i did onli i hid from him how
great had been the chanca loss in the battl and how glad thei were to
declar a truce and rest
upanqui said that the matter should be attend to speak in a royal
fashion as though it were on of littl moment which show me how
great an emperor he must be great he wa inde see that all
the broad land of england would have made but on provinc of hi vast
dominion which in everi part were fill with peopl who unless thei
chanc to be in rebellion like the yunca live but to do hi will
after thi when i thought the audienc wa end a chamberlain
advanc to the foot of the throne and kneel said that a suppliant
prai speech with the inca upanqui wave hi sceptr that long
staff which i have describ in token that he should be admit then
present up the chamber came kari arrai in the tunic and cloak of an
inca princ wear in hi ear a disc carv with the imag of the sun
and a chain of emerald and gold about hi neck nor did he come alon
for he wa attend by a brilliant band of those lord and captain
who had desert to him on the dai of the great battl he advanc and
knelt befor the throne
who is thi that carri the emblem of the holi blood and is cloth
like a princ of the sun ask upanqui affect ignor and
unconcern though i saw the colour mount to hi cheek and the sceptr
shake in hi wither hand
on who is inde of the holi inca blood on sprung from the purest
lineag of the sun answer the state kari in hi quiet voic
how then is he name ask the inca again
he is name kari firstborn son of upanqui o inca
such a son i had onc but he is long dead or so thei told me said
upanqui in a trembl voic
he is not dead o inca he live and he kneel befor you urco
poison him but the sun hi father recov him and the spirit that
is abov all god support him the sea bore him to a far land where
he found a white god who befriend and care for him here he turn
hi head toward me with thi god he return to hi own countri and
here he kneel befor you o inca
it cannot be said the inca what sign do you bring who name yourself
kari show me the imag of the spirit abov the god that from hi
childhood for gener ha been hung about the neck of the inca
eldest son born from the queen
kari open hi robe and drew out that golden effigi of pachacamac which
he alwai wore
upanqui examin it hold it close to hi rheumi ey
it seem to be the same he said as i should know upon whose breast
it lai until my first son wa born and yet who can be sure sinc such
thing mai be copi
then he hand back the imag to kari and after reflect awhil said
bring hither the mother of the royal nurs
appar thi ladi wa in wait for in a minut she appear befor
the throne an old and wither woman with beadi ey
mother said the inca you were with the coya that is the queen

by wai of answer kari with a littl smile strip himself of hi
broider tunic and other garment and stood befor us nake to the

up and search it with her bright ey

then sob and mutter she threw her arm about him and kiss him
nor did he shame to kiss her in return there befor them all
restor hi garment to the royal princ said upanqui and bring
hither the fring that is worn by the inca heir
it wa produc without delai by the highpriest larico which told
me at onc that all thi scene had been prepar upanqui took it from
larico and beckon kari to him with the priest help bound it about
hi brow therebi acknowledg him and restor him as heirappar
to the empir then he kiss him on the brow and kari knelt down and
did hi father homag
after thi thei went awai togeth accompani onli by larico and two
or three of the councillor of inca blood and as i learn from larico
afterward told each other their tale and made plan to outwit and if
need were to destroi urco and hi faction
on the follow dai kari wa establish in a hous of hi own that wa
more of a fortress than a palac for it wa built of great stone with
narrow gate and surround by an open space upon thi space as a
guard were encamp all those who had desert to him in the battl of
the field of blood who had return to cuzco from the camp of huaracha
now that kari wa accept as the royal heir also other troop who were
loyal to the inca were station near by while those who clung to urco
depart secretli to that town where he lai sick moreov proclam
wa made that on the dai of the new moon which the magician declar
to be auspici kari would be publicli present to the peopl in
the templ of the sun as the inca law heir in place of urco
disinherit for crime that he had commit against the sun the
empir and the inca hi father
brother said kari to me for so he call me now that he wa an
acknowledg princ when i went to meet him in hi grandeur brother
did i not tell you alwai that we must trust to our god see i have
not trust in vain though it is true that danger still lie ahead of
me and perhap civil war
ye i answer your god ar in the wai of give you all you want
but it is not so with mine and me
what then do you desir brother who can have even to the half of the
kingdom
kari i repli i cry not for the earth but for the moon
he understood and hi face grew stern
brother the moon alon is beyond you for she inhabit the sky while
you still dwell upon the earth he answer with a frown and then
began to talk of the peac with huaracha
chapter x
the great horror
the dai of the new moon came and with it the great horror that caus
all the empir of tavantinsuyu to trembl fear lest heaven should be
aveng upon it
sinc upanqui had found hi elder son again he began to dote upon him
as in such a case the old and weakmind often do and would walk about
the garden and palac with hi arm around hi neck babbl to him
of whatev wa uppermost in hi mind moreov hi soul wa oppress
becaus he had done kari wrong in the past and prefer urco to him
under the urg of that princ mother
the truth is son i myself heard him sai to kari that we men who
seem to rule the world do not rule it at all becaus alwai women rule
us thi thei do through our passion which the god plant in us for
their own end also becaus thei ar more singl in their mind the
man think of mani thing the woman onli think of what she desir
therefor the man whom natur alreadi ha bemus onli bring a littl
piec of hi mind to fight against her whole mind and so is conquer
he who wa made for on thing onli to be the mate of the woman that she
mai mother more men in order to serv the will of other women who yet
seem to be those men slave
so i have learn father answer the grave kari and for thi
reason have suffer in the past i am determin to have as littl to
do with women as is possibl for on in my place dure my travel in
other land as in thi countri i have seen men great and nobl brought
to nothing and ruin by their love for women down into the dirt
inde when their hand were full of the world wealth and glori
moreov i have notic that thei seldom learn wisdom and that what
thei have done befor thei ar readi to do again who believ anyth
that soft lip swear to them ye even that thei ar love for
themselv alon as i own to my sorrow onc i did myself urco could
not have taken that fair wife of mine father if she had not been
will to go when she saw that i had lost your favour and with it the
hope of the scarlet fring
here kari look at me of whom i knew he wa think all thi time
and see that i could overhear hi talk began to speak of someth
els
on the appoint dai there wa a great gather of the nobl of
the land especi of those of the inca blood and of all that were
earmen a class of the same rank as our peer in england to hear
the proclam of kari as the inca heir it wa made befor thi
gorgeou compani in the great templ of the sun which now i saw for the
first time
it wa a huge and most wondrou place well name the hous of gold
for here everyth wa gold on the western wall hung an imag of the
sun twenti feet or more across an enorm graven plate of gold set
about with gem and have ey and teeth of great emerald the roof
too and the wall were all panel with gold even the cornic and
column head were of solid gold
open out of thi templ also were other dedic to the moon and
star that of the moon be cloth in silver with her radiant face
shape in silver fix to the western wall so it wa with the templ of
the star of the lightn and of the rainbow which perhap with it
mani colour that sprang from jewel wa the most dazzl of them all
the sight of so much glori overwhelm me and it came into my mind that
if onli it were known of in europ men would die by the ten thousand
on the chanc that thei might conquer thi countri and make it wealth
their yet here save for these purpos of ornament and to be us as
offer to the god and inca it wa of no account at all
but in thi templ of the sun wa a marvel greater than it gold for on
either side of the carv like of the sun seat upon chair of
gold sat the dead inca and their queen ye cloth in their royal
robe and emblem with the fring upon their brow there thei sat with
their head bent forward so wonderfulli preserv by the art these
peopl have that except for the stamp of death upon their counten
thei might have been sleep men and women thu in the dead face
of the mother of kari i could read her like to her son of these
depart king and queen there were mani sinc from the first inca of
whom histori told all were gather here in the holi hous and under
the guardianship of the effigi of their god the sun from whom thei
believ themselv to be descend the sight wa so solemn that it
aw me as it did all that congreg for i note that here men
walk with unsandal feet and that in speak none rais their
voic high
the old inca upanqui enter glorious apparel and accompani by
lord and priest while after him came kari with hi retinu of great
men the inca bow to the compani whereon everyon in the great templ
save myself alon whose british pride kept me on my feet stand like
on left live on a battlefield among a multitud of slain prostrat
himself befor hi divin majesti at a sign thei rose again and the
inca seat himself upon hi jewel golden throne beneath the effigi
of the sun while kari took hi place upon a lesser throne to the inca
right
look at him there in hi splendour on thi dai when he came into hi
own again i bethought me of the wretch starv indian mark with
blow and foul with filth whom i had rescu from the cruel mob upon the
thamessid wharf and wonder at thi enorm chang of fortun and
the chain of wonder event by which it had been brought about
my fortun also had chang for then i wa great in my own fashion who
now had becom but a wander welcom inde in thi glitter
new world of which yonder we knew noth becaus i wa strang and
differ also full of unheardof learn and skill in war but
still noth but an outcast wander and so doom to live and die
and as i thought so thought kari for our glanc met and i read it in
hi ey
yonder sat my servant who had becom my lord and though he wa still my
friend soon i felt he would be lost in the state matter of that great
empir leav me more lone than befor also hi mind wa not as
my mind as hi blood wa not my blood and he wa the slave of a faith
that to me wa a hate superstit doubtless begotten by the devil
who under the name of cupai some worship in that land though
other declar that thi cupai wa the god of the dead
oh that i could flee awai with quilla and at her side live out what wa
left to me of life sinc of all these multitud she alon understood
and wa akin to me becaus the sacr fire of love had burn awai our
differ and open her ey but quilla wa snatch from me by the
law of their accurs faith and whatev els kari might give he would
never give me thi ladi of the moon sinc as he had said to him thi
would be sacrileg
the ceremoni began first larico the highpriest of the sun cloth
in hi white sacerdot robe made sacrific upon a littl altar which
stood in front of the inca throne
it wa a veri simpl sacrific of fruit and corn and flower with what
seem to be strangeshap piec of gold at least i saw noth els
and am sure that noth that had life wa laid upon that altar after
the fashion of the bloodi offer of the jew and inde of those of
some of the other peopl of that great land
prayer howev were spoken veri fine prayer and pure so far as i
could understand them for their languag wa more ancient and somewhat
differ to that which wa us in common speech also the priest
move about bow and bend the knee much as our own do in
celebr the mass though whether these motion were in honour of the
god or of the inca i am not sure
when the sacrific wa over and the littl fire that burn upon the
altar had sunk low though i wa told that for hundr of year it had
never been extinguish suddenli the inca began to speak with mani
particular that i had not heard befor he told the tale of kari and
of hi estrang from him in past year through the plot of the
mother of urco who now wa dead like the mother of kari thi woman
it would appear had persuad him the inca that kari wa conspir
against him and therefor urco wa order to take him prison but
return onli with kari wife sai that kari had kill himself
here upanqui becam overcom with emot as the ag ar apt to do
and beat hi breast even shed tear becaus most unjustli he had
allow these thing to happen and the wick triumph over the good
for which sin he said he felt sure hi father the sun would bring some
punish on him as inde wa to chanc sooner than he thought then
he continu hi stori set out all urco iniqu and sacrileg
against the god also hi murder of peopl of high and low degre and
hi steal of their wive and daughter lastli he told of the come
of kari who wa suppos to be dead and all that stori which i have set
out
have finish hi tale with much solemn ceremoni he depos urco
from hi heirship to the empir which he gave back to kari to whom it
belong by right of birth and call upon hi dead forefath on by
on to be wit to the act with great formal onc more he bound
the princ fring about hi brow as he did thi he said these word
soon o princ kari you must chang thi yellow circlet for that which
i wear and take with it all the burden of empir for know that as
quickli as mai be i purpos to withdraw to my palac at yucai there to
make my peac with god befor i am call henc to dwell in the mansion
of the sun
when he had finish kari did homag to hi father and in that quiet
even voic of hi told hi tale of the wrong that he had suffer
at the hand of urco hi brother and of how he had escap live but
madden from hi hate he told also how he had wander across the
sea though of england he said noth and been save from miseri and
death by myself a veri great person in my own countri still sinc i
had suffer wrong there as he kari had in hi he had persuad me
to accompani him back to hi own land that there my wisdom might shine
upon it dark and ow to my divin and magic gift hither we
had come in safeti lastli he ask the assembl priest and lord if
thei were content to accept him as the inca to be and to stand by him
in ani war that urco might wage against him
to thi thei answer that thei were content and would stand by him
then follow mani other rite such as the inform of the dead
inca on by on of thi solemn declar through the mouth of the
highpriest and the offer of mani prayer to them and to the sun
their father so long were these prayer with the chant from choir
hidden in side chapel by which thei were interspers that the dai
drew toward it close befor all wa done
thu it came about that the dusk wa gather when the inca follow
by kari myself the priest and all the congreg left the templ
to present kari as the heir to the throne to the vast crowd which wait
upon the open squar outsid it door
here the ceremoni went on the inca and most of us for there wa not
space for all although we were pack as close togeth as hast
her in a basket took our stand upon a platform that wa surround
by a marvel cabl made of link of solid gold which it wa said
need fifti men to lift it from the ground then upanqui whose
strength seem restor to him perhap becaus of some drug that he
had eaten or under the spur of thi great event step forward to the
edg of the low platform and address the multitud in eloqu word
set out the matter as he had done in the templ he end hi speech
by ask the formal question
do you children of the sun accept the princ kari my firstborn to
be inca after me
there wa a roar of assent and as it di awai upanqui turn to call
kari to him that he might present him to the peopl
at thi veri moment in the gather twilight i saw a great fiercefac
man with a bandag head whom i knew to be urco leap over the golden
chain he sprang upon the platform and with a shout of i do not accept
him and thu i pai back treacheri plung a gleam copper knife or
sword into the inca breast
in an instant befor ani could stir in that pack crowd urco had
leapt back over the golden chain and from the edg of the platform to
vanish amongst those beneath who doubtless were men of hi follow
disguis as citizen or peasant
inde all who beheld seem frozen with horror on great sigh went up
and then there wa silenc sinc no such deed as thi wa known in
the annal of that empir for a moment the ag upanqui stood upon hi
feet the blood pour down hi white beard and jewel robe then he
turn a littl and said in a clear and gentl voic
kari you will be inca sooner than i thought receiv me o god my
father and pardon thi murder who i think can be no true son of
mine
then he fell forward on hi face and when we lift him he wa dead
still the silenc hung it wa as though the tongu of men were smitten
with dumb at length kari step forward and cri
the inca is dead but i the inca live on to aveng him i declar war
upon urco the murder and all who cling to urco
now the spell wa lift and from those dim hord there went up a yell
of hatr against urco the butcher and parricid while men rush to
and fro search for him in vain for he had escap in the dark
on the follow dai with more ceremoni though mani of these were
omit becaus of the terror and troubl of the time kari wa crown
inca exchang the yellow for the crimson fring and take the throne
name of upanqui after hi father in cuzco there wa none to sai him nai
for the whole citi wa horrorstruck becaus of the sacrileg that had
been commit also those who clung to urco had fled awai with him to
a town name huarina on the border of the great lake call titicaca
where wa an island with marvel templ full of gold which town lai
at a distanc from cuzco
then the civil war began and rage for three whole month though of
all that happen in that time becaus of the labour of it i set down
littl who would get forward with my stori
in thi war i plai a great part the fear of kari wa that the
chanca see the inca realm thu rent in two would onc more attack
cuzco thi it becam my busi to prevent as the ambassador of kari
i visit the camp of huaracha bear offer of peac which gave to
him more than he could ever hope to win by strength of arm i found the
old warriork still sick and wast becaus of the hurt from urco
club though now he could walk upon crutch and set out the case he
answer that he had no wish to fight against kari who had offer him
such honour term especi when he wa wage war against urco
whom he huaracha hate becaus he had striven to poison hi daughter
and dealt him a blow which he wa sure would end in hi death therefor
he wa readi to make a firm peac with the new inca if in addit to
what he offer he would surrend to him quilla who wa hi heiress and
would be queen of the chanca after him
with these word i went back to kari onli to find that on thi matter
he wa hard as a rock of the mountain in vain did i plead with him
and in vain did the highpriest larico by subtl hint and argument
strive to gentl hi mind
my brother said kari in that soft even voic of hi when he had
heard me patient to the end forgiv me if i tell you that in
advanc thi prayer for on word you sai on behalf of king huaracha
you sai two for yourself who have unhappili been bewitch by her
desir thi virgin of the sun the ladi quilla to be your wife my
brother take everyth els that i have to give but leav thi ladi
alon if i hand her over to huaracha or to you as i have told you
befor i should bring upon myself and upon my peopl the curs of my
father the sun and of pachacamac the spirit who is abov the sun it
wa becaus upanqui my father accord to the flesh dare to look
upon her after she had enter the hous of the sun as i have learn
he did that a bloodi and a cruel death came upon him for so the
magician and the wise men have assur me that the oracl declar
therefor rather than do thi crime of crime i would choos that
huaracha should renew the war against us and that you should join
yourself to him or even to urco and strive to tear me from the throne
for then even if i were slain i should die with honour
that i could never do i answer sadli
no my brother hubert for now he call me by my english name again
that you could never do be what you ar as i know well so like the
rest of us you must bear your burden mayhap it mai pleas my god or
your god in the end and in some wai that i cannot forese to give you
thi woman whom you seek but of my free will i will never give her to
you to me the deed would be as though in your land of england the king
command the consecr bread and cup of wine to be snatch from the
hand of the priest of your templ and cast to the dog or given to
cheer the infidel within your gate or drag awai the nun from your
convent to becom their leman what would you think of such a king
in your own countri and what he ad with mean would you have
thought of me if there i had stolen on of these nun becaus she wa
beauti and i desir her as a wife
now although kari word stung me becaus of the truth that wa in
them i answer that to me thi matter wore anoth face also that
quilla had becom a virgin of the sun not of her own free will but to
escap from urco
ye my brother he answer becaus you believ my religion to be
idolatri and do not understand that the sun to me is the symbol and
garment of god and that when we of the inca blood or those of us who
have the inner knowledg talk of him as our father we mean that we ar
the children of god though the common peopl ar taught otherwis for
the rest thi ladi took her vow of her own free will and of her secret
reason i know noth ani more than i know why she offer herself in
marriag to urco befor she found you upon the island for you i griev
and for her also yet i would have you rememb that as your own
priest teach in everi life that is not brutal there must be loss
sorrow and sacrific sinc by these step onli man can climb toward
the thing of the spirit pluck then such flower as you will from the
garden that fate give you but leav thi on white bloom alon
in such word as these he preach at me till at length i could bear no
more and said roughli
to me it is a veri evil thing o inca to separ those who love each
other and on that cannot be pleas to heaven therefor great as
you ar and friend of mine as you ar i tell you to your face that if
i can take the ladi quilla out of that golden grave of her i shall do
so
i know it my brother he answer and therefor were i as some
inca have been i should caus thi holi spous to travel more quickli
to the ski than natur will take her but thi i will not do becaus
i know also that destini is abov all thing and that which destini
decre will happen unhelp by man still i tell you that i will thwart
you if i can and that should you succe in your end i will kill you
if i can and the ladi also becaus you have commit sacrileg ye
although i love you better than ani other man i will kill you and if
king huaracha should be abl to snatch her awai by forc i will make war
on him until either i and my peopl or he and hi peopl ar destroi
and now let us talk no more of thi matter but rather of our plan
against urco sinc in these at least where no woman is concern i
know that you will be faith to me and i sore need your help
so with a heavi heart i went back to the camp of huaracha and told him
kari word he wa veri wroth when he heard them sinc hi god were
differ to those of the inca and he thought noth of the holi
of the virgin of the sun and onc again talk of renew the war
still it came to noth for sundri reason of which the greatest wa
that hi sick increas on him as the dai went by also i told him
that much as i desir quilla i could not fight upon hi side sinc
i wa sworn to aid kari against urco and my word might not be broken
moreov the yunca who had been our alli weari of their long
absenc from home and satisfi with the gentl forgiv and the
redress of their grievanc which the new inca had promis them were
gone have depart on their long march to the coast while mani
of the chanca themselv were slip back to their own countri
therefor huaracha hour had pass by
so at length we agre that it would be foolish to attack cuzco in
order to try to rescu quilla sinc even if huaracha won in face of a
desper defenc probabl it would be onli to find that hi daughter
wa dead or had vanish awai to some unknown and distant convent all
that we could do wa to trust to fortun to deliv her into our hand
we agre further that have obtain an honour peac and all
els that he desir it would be well for huaracha to return to hi own
land leav me a bodi of five thousand pick men who were will to
serv under me to assist in the war against urco to be my guard and
that of quilla if perchanc i could deliv her from the hous of the
sun
when thi wa known five thousand of the best and bravest of the
chanca young soldier who sought adventur and battl and whom i had
train step forward at onc and swore themselv to my servic
bid farewel to huaracha with these troop i return to cuzco
send messeng ahead to explain the reason of their come to kari
who welcom them well and gave them quarter round the palac which wa
allot to me
a few dai later we advanc on the town huarina a great host of us
and outsid of it met the yet greater host of urco in a mighti battl
that endur for a dai and a night and yet like that of the field of
blood remain neither lost nor won when the thousand of the dead had
been buri and the wound sent back to cuzco we attack the citi
of huarina i lead the van with my chanca and storm the place
drive urco and hi forc out on the farther side
thei retreat to the mountain and there follow a long and tediou
war without great battl at length although the inca armi had
suffer sore we forc those of urco to the shore of the lake
titicaca where most of them melt awai into the swamp and certain
treeclad lowli vallei urco himself howev with a number of
follow escap in boat to the holi island in the lake
we built a fleet of balsa with reed and blownout sheepskin and
follow him land on the isl we storm the citi of templ which
were more wondrou and even fuller of gold and preciou thing than
those of cuzco here the men of urco fought desper but drive
them from street to street at length we pen them in on of the
largest of the templ of which by some mischanc a reed roof wa set
on fire so that there thei perish miser it wa a dread scene
such as i never wish to behold again also after all urco and some
of hi captain break out of the burn templ under cover of the
smoke escap either in balsa or as mani declar by swim the
lake at least thei were gone nor search as we might on the mainland
could thei be found
so all be finish except for the escap of urco we return to
cuzco which kari enter in triumph i march at hi side weari out
with war and bloodsh
chapter xi
the hous of death
now at on time dure thi long war against urco victori smile
upon him though afterward the scale went down against him kari wa
defeat in a pitch battl and i who command anoth armi wa
almost surround in a vallei when everyth seem lost afterward
i escap by lead my soldier round up the slope of a mountain and
surpris urco in the rear but as it end well for us i need not
speak of that matter
it wa while all wa at it blackest for us that a certain offic wa
brought to me who wa captur while strive to desert or at least to
pass our outpost as it happen i knew thi man again have
unseen myself note him on the previou dai talk earnestli to
the highpriest larico who with other priest accompani my armi
perhap to keep a watch on me i took thi captain apart and question
him alon threaten him with death by torment if he did not reveal
hi errand to me
in the end be veri much afraid he spoke from him i learn that
he wa a messeng from larico to urco believ that our defeat wa
almost certain larico had sent him to make hi peac with urco by
betrai all kari and my own plan to him and reveal how he might
most easili destroi us he said also that he larico had onli join
the parti of upanqui and of kari after him under threat of death and
that alwai in hi heart he had been true to urco whom he acknowledg
as hi lord and as the right inca whom he would help to restor to
the throne with all the power of the priesthood of the sun further
he sent by thi spy a secret messag by mean of littl cord cunningli
knot which knot serv these peopl as write sinc thei could
read them as we read a book
now be alwai desir of knowledg i had caus myself to be
instruct in the plan of thi knotwrit which by thi time i could
read well enough therefor i wa abl to spell out thi messag it
said shortli but plainli that know he still desir her he larico
as highpriest would hand over to urco the ladi quilla daughter to
the king of the chanca who unlawfulli had been hidden awai among
the virgin of the sun also that he would betrai me the
whitegodfromthesea who sought to steal her awai into urco hand
that he might kill me if he could
when i had master all thi i wa fill with rage and bethought me
that i would caus larico to be taken and suffer the fate of traitor
soon howev i chang thi mind of mine and place the spy in close
keep where none could come at him i set a watch on larico but said
noth to him or to kari of all that i had learn
a few dai later our fortun chang and urco defeat wa in full
flight to the shore of lake titicaca after thi i knew we had noth
more to fear from thi foxheart highpriest who abov everyth
desir to be on the win side and to continu in hi place and
power so know that i held him fast i bide my time becaus through
him alon i could hope to come at quilla that time came after the
war wa over and we had return to cuzco in triumph as soon as the
rejoic were over and kari wa firmli seat on hi throne i sent
for larico which as the greatest man in the kingdom after the inca i
wa abl to do
he appear in answer to my summon and we bow to each other after
which he began to prais me for my generalship sai that had it not
been for me urco would have won the war and that the inca had done well
to name me hi brother befor the peopl and to sai that to me he ow
hi throne
ye that is true i answer and now sinc through me you
larico ar the third greatest man in the kingdom and remain highpriest
of the sun and whisper in the inca ear i would put you in mind of
a certain bargain that we made when i promis you all these thing
larico
what bargain lordofthesea
that you would bring me and a virgin of the sun who while she wa of
the earth wa name quilla togeth larico and enabl her to return
from those of the sun to my arm larico
now hi face grew troubl and he answer
lord i have thought much of thi matter desir abov all thing to
fulfil my word and i griev to tell you that it is imposs
why larico
becaus i find that the law of my faith is against it lord
is that all larico i ask with a smile
no lord becaus i find that the inca would not suffer it and swear
to kill all who attempt to touch the ladi quilla
is that all larico
no lord becaus i find that a woman who ha been betroth to on of
the royal blood mai never pass to anoth man
now perhap we come nearer to it larico you mean that if thi
happen and perchanc after all urco should come to the throne as he
might do if kari hi brother dieda ani man mai dieh would hold you
to account
ye lord if that chanc as chanc it mai sinc urco still live
and i hear is gather new armi among the mountain certainli he
would hold me to account for i have heard as much also our father
the sun would hold me to account and so would the inca who wield hi
sceptr upon earth
i ask him why he did not think of all these thing befor when he had
much to gain instead of now when he had gain them through me and he
answer becaus he had not consid them enough then i pretend to
grow angri and exclaim
you ar a rogu larico you promis and take your pai and you do not
perform henceforth i am your enemi and on to whom the inca hearken
he hearken still more to thi god the sun and to me who am the voic
of god white man he answer ad insol you would strike
too late your power over me and my fortun is gone white man
i fear it is so i repli pretend to be frighten so let us
sai no more of the matter after all there ar other women in cuzco
besid thi fair bride of the sun now befor you go highpriest will
you who ar so learn help me who am ignor i have been strive to
master your method of convei thought by mean of knot here i have
a bundl of string which i cannot altogeth understand be pleas to
interpret them to me o most holi and upright highpriest
then from my robe i drew out those knot fibr that i had taken from
hi messeng and held them befor larico ey
he stare at them and turn pale hi hand grope for hi dagger till
he saw that mine wa on the hilt of waveflam whereon he let it fall
next the thought took him that in truth i could not read the knot which
he began to interpret fals
have done traitor i laugh for i know them all so urco mai wed
quilla and i mai not also ceas to fret as to that messeng of
your for whom you seek far and near sinc he is safe in my keep
tomorrow i take him to deliv hi messag not to urco but to
kariand then traitor
now larico who notwithstand hi stern face and proud manner wa a
coward at heart fell upon hi knee befor me trembl and prai me
to spare hi life which lai in my hand well he knew that if onc it
came to kari ear even a high priest of the sun could not hope to
escap the reward of such treacheri as hi
if i pardon you what will you give me i ask
the onli thing that you will take lordth ladi quilla herself
hearken lord outsid the citi is the palac of upanqui whom urco slew
there in the great hall the divin inca sit embalm and into that holi
presenc none dare enter save the virgin of the sun whose offic it is
to wait upon the mighti dead tomorrow on hour befor the dawn when
all men sleep i will lead you to thi hall disguis in the robe of a
priest of the sun so that on the wai thither none can know you there
you will find but on virgin of the sun the ladi whom you seek take
her and begon the rest i leav to you
how do i know that you will not set some trap for me larico
thu lord that i shall be with you and share your sacrileg also my
life will be in your hand
ay larico i answer grimli and if aught of ill befal me
rememb that thi and i touch the knot cord will find it wai
to kari and with it the man who wa your messeng
he nod and answer
be sure that i have but on desir to know you lord and thi woman
whom be mad you seek so madli far from cuzco and never to look
upon your face again
then we made our plan as to when and where we should meet and other
matter after which he depart bow himself awai with mani smile
i thought to myself that there went as big a rogu as i had ever known
in london or elsewher and fell to wonder what snare he would set
for me sinc that he plan some snare i wa sure why then did i
prepar to fall into it i ask myself the answer wa for a doubl
reason first although my whole heart wa sick with long for the
sight of her now after month of seek i wa no nearer to quilla
than when we had part in the citi of the chanca nor ever should
be without larico aid secondli some voic within me told me to go
forward take all hazard sinc if i did not our part would be for
alwai in thi world ye the voic warn me that unless i save her
soon quilla would be no more as huaracha had said there wa more
poison in cuzco and murder were not far to seek or despair might do
it work with her or she might kill herself as onc she had propos to
do so i would go forward even though the path i walk should lead me
to my doom
that dai i did mani thing now be so great a gener and manor
godamong these peopl i had those about me who were sworn to my
servic and whom i could trust for on of these a princ of the inca
blood of the hous of kari mother i sent and gave to him those
knot cord that were the proof of larico treacheri bid him if
aught of evil overtook me or if i could not be found to deliv them
to the inca on my behalf and with them the prison messeng who wa in
hi keep but meanwhil to show them to no man he bow and swore by
the sun to do my bid think doubtless that my work finish in
thi land i purpos to return into the sea out of which i had risen
as doubtless a god could do
next i summon the captain of the chanca who had fought under me
throughout the civil war of whom about half remain aliv and bade
them gather their men upon the ridg where i had stood at the begin
of the battl of the field of blood and wait until i join them
there if it chanc howev that i did not appear within six dai
i command that thei should march back to their own countri and make
report to king huaracha that i had return into the sea for reason
that he would guess also i command that eight famou warrior whom i
name men of my own bodyguard who had fought with me in all our battl
and would have follow me through fire or water or the gate of hell
themselv should come to the courtyard of my palac after nightfal
bring a litter and disguis as it bearer but have their arm
hidden beneath their cloak
these matter settl i wait upon the inca kari and crave of him
leav to take a journei i told him that i wa weari with so much
fight and desir to rest amidst my friend the chanca
he gaze at me awhil then stretch out hi sceptr to me in token
that my request wa grant and said in a sad voic
so you would leav me my brother becaus i cannot give you that which
you desir bethink you you will be no nearer to the moon by which
he meant quilla at chanca than you ar at cuzco and here next to the
inca you ar the greatest in the empir who by decre ar name hi
brother and the gener of hi armi
now though my gorg rose at it i li to him sai
the moon is set for me so let her sleep whom i shall see no more for
the rest learn o kari that huaracha ha sworn to me that i shall be
not hi brother but hi son and huaracha is sickthei sai to death
you mean that you would choos to be king over the chanca rather
than stand next to the throne among the quichua he said scan me
sharpli
ay kari i repli still ly sinc i must dwell in thi strang
land i would do so as a kingno less
to that you have a right brother who ar far abov us all but when
you ar a king what is your plan do you purpos to strive to conquer
me and rule over tavantinsuyu as perchanc you could do
nai i shall never make war upon you kari unless you break your
treati with the chanca and strive to subdu them
which i shall never do brother
then he paus awhil and spoke again with more passion that i had ever
known in him sai
would that thi woman who come between us were dead would that she
had never been born in truth i am mind to prai to my father the
sun that he will be pleas to take her to himself for then perchanc
we two might be as we were in the old time yonder in your england and
when we face peril side by side upon the ocean and in the forest a
curs on woman the divid and all the curs of all the god upon thi
woman whom i mai not give to you had she been of my household i would
have bidden you to take her ye even if she were my wife but she is
the wife of the god and therefor i mai notala i mai not and he
hid hi face in hi robe and groan
now when i heard these word i grew afraid who knew well that she of
whom the inca prai the sun that she mai die doe die and swiftli
do not add to thi ladi wrong by rob her of life as well as of
sight and liberti kari i said
have no fear brother he answer she is safe from me no word
shall pass my lip though it is true that in my heart i wish that she
would die go your wai brother and friend and when you grow weari
of kingship if it come to you as to tell truth alreadi i grow weari
return to me perchanc forget that we had been king we might
journei henc togeth over the world edg
then he stood up on hi throne and bow toward me kiss the air as
though to a god and take the royal chain that everi inca wore from
about hi neck set it upon mine thi done turn he left me without
anoth word
with a heavi heart i return to my palac where i dwelt at sundown i
at accord to my custom and dismiss those who wait upon me to
the servant quarter there were but two of them for my privat life
wa simpl then i slept till past midnight and rise went into
the courtyard where i found the eight chanca captain disguis
as litterbear and with them the litter i led them to an empti
guardhous and bade them stai there in silenc after thi i return
to my chamber and wait
about two hour befor the dawn larico came knock on the sidedoor
as we had plan i open to him and he enter disguis in a hood
cloak of sheep wool which cover hi robe and hi face such as
priest wear when the weather is cold he gave to me the garment of a
priest of the sun which he had brought with him in a cloth i cloth
myself in them though becaus of the fashion of them to do thi i must
be rid of my armour which would have betrai me larico desir that i
should take off the sword waveflam also but mistrust him thi
i would not do but made shift to hide it and my dagger beneath the
priest cloak the armour i wrap in a bundl and took with me
present we went out have spoken few word sinc the time for speech
had gone by and peril or some fear of what might befal weigh upon our
tongu in the guardhous i found the chanca at whom larico look
curious but said noth to them i gave the bundl of armour to be
hidden in the litter and with it my long bow have first reveal
myself to them by lift the hood of my cloak then i bade them follow
me
larico and i walk in front and after us came the eight men four of
them bear the empti litter and the other four march behind thi
wa well plan sinc if ani saw us or if we met guard as onc or
twice we did these thought that we were priest take on who wa sick
or dead to be tend or to be made readi for burial onc howev we
were challeng but larico spoke some word and we pass on without
question
at length in the dark befor the dawn we came to the privat palac
of dead upanqui at it garden gate larico would have had me leav the
litter with the eight chanca warrior disguis as bearer i refus
sai that thei must come to the door of the palac and when he grew
urgent tap my sword whisper to him fierc that he had best
bewar lest it should be he who stai at the gate then he gave wai
and we advanc all of us across the garden to the door of the palac
larico unlock the door with a kei and we enter he and i alon for
here i bade the chanca await my return
we crept down a short passag that wa curtain at it end pass
the curtain i found myself in upanqui banquetinghal thi hall wa
dimli lit with on hang golden lamp by it light i saw someth
more wondrou and of it sort more aw than ever i had seen in that
strang land
there on a dai in hi chair of gold sat dead upanqui arrai in all
hi gorgeou inca robe and so marvel preserv that he might have
been a man asleep with arm cross and hi sceptr at hi side he sat
stare down the hall with fix and empti ey a dread figur of
life in death about him and around the dai were set all hi rich
vase and furnitur of gold and jewel pile in heap there to remain
till the roof fell in and buri them sinc on thi hallow wealth
the boldest dare not lai a hand in the centr of the hall also wa
a tabl prepar as though for feaster for amid jewel cup and
platter stood the meat and wine which dai by dai were brought afresh
by the virgin of the sun doubtless there were more wonder but these
i could not see becaus the light did not reach them or to the doorwai
of the chamber that open from the hall moreov there wa someth
els which caught my ey
at the foot of the dai crouch a figur which at first i took to be
that of some dead on also embalm perhap a wife or daughter of the
dead inca who had been set with him in thi place while i stare at
it the figur stir have heard our footstep rose and turn
stand so that the light from the hang lamp fell full upon it it
wa quilla clad in white and purpl with a golden like of the sun
blazon upon her breast
so beauteou did she look search the dark with great blind ey
and her rich flow hair flow from beneath her jewel headdress
a diadem fashion to resembl the sun rai that my breath fail me
and my heart stood still
there stand she whom you seek mutter larico in a mock whisper
for here even he did not seem to dare to talk aloud go take her you
whom men call a god but i call a drunken fool readi to risk all for
a woman lip go take her and ask the bless upon your kiss of
yonder dead king whose holi rest you break
be silent i whisper back and pass round the tabl till i came
face to face with quilla then a strang dumb fell upon me like a
spell or dead upanqui curs so that i could not speak
i stood there stare at those beauti blind ey and the blind ey
stare back at me present a look of understand gather on the
face and quilla spoke or rather murmur to herself
strangebut i could have sworn strang but i seem to feel oh i
slept in my vigil upon that dead old man who in life wa so foolish
and in death appear to have becom so wise and sleep i dream i
dream i heard a step i shall never hear again i dream on wa near
me whom i shall never touch again i will sleep onc more for in my
dark what ar left to me save sleep anddeath
then at last i found my tongu and said hoars
love is left quilla andlif
she heard and straighten herself her whole bodi seem to becom
rigid as though with an agoni of joi her blind ey flash her lip
quiver she stretch out her hand feel at the dark her
finger touch my forehead and thenc she ran them swiftli over my
face
it isdead or livingit is and she open her arm
oh wa there ever anyth more beauti on the earth than thi sight
of the blind quilla thu open her arm to me there in the gorgeou
hous of death
we clung and kiss then i thrust her awai sai
come swiftli from thi illomen place all is readi the chanca
wait
she slip her hand into mine and i turn to lead her awai
then it wa that i heard a low mock laugh larico i thought
heard also a sound of creep footstep around me i look out of the
dark that hid the door of the chamber on the right appear a giant
form which i knew for that of urco and behind him other i look
to the left and there were more of them while in front beyond the
goldlaid board stood the traitor larico laugh
you have the first fruit but it seem that anoth will reap the
harvest lordfromthesea he jeer
seiz her cri urco in hi guttur voic point to quilla with
hi mace and brain that white thief
i drew waveflam and strove to get at him but from both side men
rush in on me on i cut down but the other snatch quilla awai
i wa surround with no room to wield my sword and alreadi weapon
flash over me a thought came to me the chanca were at the door i
must reach them for perhap so quilla might be save in front wa
the tabl spread for the death feast with a bound i leapt on to it
shout aloud and scatter it golden furnish thi wai and that
beyond stood the traitor larico who had trap mei sprang at him
and lift waveflam with both hand i smote with all my strength he
fell as it seem to me cloven to the middl then some spear cast at
me struck the lamp
it shatter and went out
chapter xii
the fight to the death
there wa tumult in the hall shout groan from him whom i had
first struck down the sound of vase and vessel overthrown and abov
all those of a woman shriek echo from the wall and roof so that
i could not tell whenc thei came
through the gross dark i went on toward the curtain or so i
hope present thei were torn open and by the faint light of the
break dawn i saw my eight chanca rush toward me
follow i cri and at the head of them grope my wai back up the
hall seek for quilla i stumbl over the dead bodi of larico and
felt a path round the tabl then suddenli a door at the back of the
hall wa thrown open and by the grei light which came through the
doorwai i perceiv the last of the ravish depart we scrambl
across the dai where the golden chair wa overthrown and the embalm
upanqui lai a stiff and huddl heap upon hi back stare at me with
jewel ey
we gain the door which happili none had rememb to close and
pass out into the parklik ground beyond a hundr pace or more
ahead of us by the glow light i saw a litter pass between the
tree surround by arm men and knew that in it wa quilla be
born to captiv and shame
after it we sped it pass the gate of the park wall but when we
reach that gate it wa shut and bar and we must wast time break
it down which we did by help of a fell tree that lai at hand we were
through it and now the rim of the sun had appear so that through the
morn mist which clung to the hillsid beyond the town we could
see the litter the full half of a mile awai on we went up the hill
gain as we ran for we had no litter to bear nor aught els save the
sack of armour which on of the chanca had thought to bring with him
when he rush into the hall and with it my long bow and shaft
now at a certain place between thi hill and anoth there wa a gorg
such as ar common in that countri a gorg so deep and narrow that
in place the light of dai scarc struggl to the pathwai at it
bottom into thi tunnel the litter vanish and when we drew near i saw
that it mouth wa held by arm men six of them or more take my bow
from the chanca i strung it and shot swiftli the man at whom i aim
went down again i shot and anoth fell whereon the rest of them took
cover behind stone
throw back the bow to the chanca for now it wa useless we charg
that busi wa soon over for present all those of urco men who
remain there were dead save on who be cut off fled down hill
toward the citi take with him the new of what had pass in the
palac of dead upanqui
we enter the mouth of the gorg plung toward the gloom though as
it chanc thi place face toward the east so that the low sun which
now wa fulli up shone down it and gave us light that later would have
been lack
i who wa veri swift of foot and to whom rage and fear gave wing
outran my companion swing myself round a rock which lai in the
pathwai i saw the litter again not a hundr yard ahead it halt
becaus as it seem to me on or more of the bearer stumbl and
fell among the stone i rush at them roar perhap it had been
wiser to wait for my companion but i wa mad and fear noth thei
saw me and a cry went up of
the white god the terribl white god
then fear took hold of them and thei fled leav the litter on the
ground ye all of them fled save on urco himself
he stood there roll hi ey and gnash hi teeth look huge
and aw in those shadow look like a devil from hell suddenli a
thought seem to take him and leap at the litter he tore asid it
curtain and drag out quilla who fell prone upon the ground
if i mai not have her you shall not white thief see i give back hi
bride to the sun he shout and lift hi copper sword to pierc her
through
now i wa still ten pace or so awai and saw that befor i could reach
him that sword would be in her heart what could i do oh st hubert
must have help me then for i knew in an instant in my hand wa
waveflam and with all my strength i hurl it at hi head
the great blade hurtl hiss through the air i saw the sunlight
shine on it he strove to leap clear but too late for it caught him
on the hand that he had lift to protect hi head and shore off two of
hi finger so that he drop hi sword next instant still roar
as doubtless old thorgrimm my forefath us to do when he fought
to the death for blood is veri strong i leapt on the giant who like
myself wa swordless there in the gulf we wrestl he wa a mighti
man but now my strength wa as that of ten i threw him to the ground
by a sussex trick i knew and there we roll over and over each other
onc he had me undermost and i think would have choke me had it not
been that hi right hand lack two finger
with a mighti heav i lift him so that now we lai side by side he
wa grope for a knifei did not see but knew it near hi head a
sharpedg stone rose in the path to the height of a man hand or
more i saw it and bethought me what to do if i could again i heav
and as at length he found the knife and stab at me scratch my
face i got hi bull neck upon that stone then i loos my hand and
caught him by the hair back i press hi great head back and back
with all my might till someth snap
urco neck wa broken urco quiver and wa dead
i lai by hi side pant a voic came from the white heap upon the
ground by whom and for whom thi dread combat had been fought the
voic of quilla
on di but who live ask the voic
i could not answer becaus i had no breath all my strength wa gone
still i sat up support myself with my hand and hope that it would
come back quilla turn her face toward me or rather toward the
sound that i had made in move and i thought to myself how sad it wa
that she should be blind present she spoke again and now her voic
quaver
i see who it is that live she said someth ha broken in my
ey and lord and love i see that it is you who live you you and
oh you bleed
then the chanca came bound down the gorg and found us
thei look at the dead giant and saw how he had di kill by
strength not by the sword thei look and bent the knee and prais
me sai that i wa inde a god sinc no man could have done thi
deed kill the huge urco with hi nake hand then thei place
quilla back in her litter and six of them bore her down that black
gorg the two who remain for in that fight none of them had been
hurt support me till my strength came back for the cut in the face
that i had receiv from urco dagger wa but slight we reach the
mouth of the gorg and took counsel
to return to cuzco after what i had done would be to seek death so we
bore awai to the right and make a round came about ten oclock of
the morn unmolest by ani to that ridg on which i had stood at the
begin of the battl of the field of blood there i found the chanca
encamp some three thousand of them as i had command when thei
saw me live and but littl hurt thei shout for joi and when thei
learn who wa in that litter thei went wellnigh mad
then the eight warrior with me told them all the tale of the save
of quilla and the death of the giant urco at my hand whereon their
captain came and kiss my feet sai that i wa in truth a god
though heretofor some of them had held me to be but a man
god or man i answer i must rest let the women tend to ladi
quilla and give me food and drink after which i will sleep at sunset
we march home to huaracha your king and mine to give him back hi
daughter till then there is naught to fear sinc kari ha no troop at
hand with which to attack us still set outpost
so i at and drank but littl of the former and much of the latter i
fear and after that i slept as soundli as on who is dead for i wa
outworn
when the sun wa within an hour of set captain awaken me and
said that an embassi from cuzco ten men onli wait outsid our line
seek speech with me so i rose and my face and wound have been
dress caus water to be pour over my bodi and wa rub with
oil after which cloth in the robe of a chanca nobl but wear no
armour i went out with nine chanca captain to receiv the embassi on
the plain at the foot of the hill at that veri spot where first i had
fought with urco
when we drew near from out of the group of nobl advanc on man i
look and saw that he wa kari ye the inca himself
i went forward to meet him and we spoke togeth just out of earshot of
our follow
my brother said kari i have learn all that ha pass and i
give you prais who ar the most dare among men and the first among
warrior you who slew the giant urco with your nake hand
and thu made your throne safe for you kari
and thu made my throne safe for me you also who clove larico to the
breast in the deathhous of upanqui my father
and thu deliv you from a traitor kari
and thu deliv me from a traitor as i have learn also from your
messeng who hand to me the knot cord and from the spy whom you
had in your keep i repeat that you ar the most dare among men and
the first among warrior almost a god as my peopl name you
i bow and after a littl silenc he went on
would that thi were all that i have to sai but ala it is not you
have commit the great sacrileg against the sun my father of which
i warn you have rob him of hi bride and my brother you have
li to me who told me but yesterdai that you had put all thought of
her from your mind
to me that wa no sacrileg kari but rather a righteou deed to free
on from the bond of a faith in which neither she nor i believ and to
lead her from a live tomb back to life and love
and wa the lie righteou also brother
ay i answer boldli if ever a lie can be bethink you you prai
that thi ladi might die becaus she came between you and me and those
that king prai mai die do die if not with their knowledg or by their
express command therefor i said that i had put her from my mind in
order that she might go on live
to cherish you in her arm brother now hearken becaus of thi deed
of your we who were more than friend have becom more than foe you
have declar war upon my god and me therefor i declar war upon you
yet hearken again i do not wish that thousand of men should perish
becaus of our quarrel therefor i make an offer to you it is that you
should fight me here and now man to man and let the sun or pachacamac
beyond the sun decid the matter as mai be decre
fight you fight you kari the inca i gasp
ay fight me to the death sinc between us all is over and done in
england you nurtur me here in the land of tavantinsuyu which i rule
todai i have nurtur you and in my shadow you have grown great
though it is true that had it not been for your generalship perchanc
i should no longer be here to throw the shadow let us therefor set the
on thing against the other and forget all between us that is past
stand face to face as foe mayhap you will conquer me be so mighti
a man of war mayhap also if that chanc my peopl who look upon you
as half a god will rais you up to be inca after me should such be your
desir
it is not i broke in
i believ you he answer bow hi head but will it not be the
desir of that fairfac harlot who ha betrai our lord the sun
at thi word i start and bit my lip
ah that sting you he went on as the truth alwai sting and it
is well understand white lord who were onc my brother that either
you must fight me to the death or i declar war upon you and upon the
chanca peopl which war i will wage from month to month and from year
to year until you ar all destroi as destroi you shall be but
should you fight and should the sun give me the victori then justic
will be accomplish and i will keep the peac that i have sworn with
the chanca peopl further should you conquer me in the name of my
peopl i swear that there shall still be peac between them and the
chanca sinc i shall have aton your sacrileg with my blood now
summon those lord of your and i will summon mine and set out the
matter to them
so i turn and beckon to my captain and kari beckon to hi thei
came and in the hear of all veri clearli and quietli as wa hi
fashion he repeat everi word that he had said to me ad to
them other of like mean while he spoke i thought not listen
overmuch
thi thing wa hate to me yet i wa in a snare sinc accord to
the custom of all these peopl i could not refus such a challeng and
remain unsham moreov it wa to the advantag of the chanca
ay and of the quichua also that i should not refus it see
that whether i live or di peac would then reign between them who
otherwis must both be destroi by war i rememb how onc quilla
had sacrif herself to prevent such a war though in the end that war
had come and what quilla had done should i not do also weari though
i wa i did not fear kari brave and swift as he might be inde i
thought that i could kill him and perhap take hi throne sinc the
quichua worship me who so often had led their armi to triumph
almost as much as did the chanca buti could not kill kari as soon
would i kill on born of my own mother wa there then no escap
the answer rose in my mind there wa an escap i could suffer kari to
kill me onli if i did thi what of quilla after all that had come and
gone must i lose quilla thu and must quilla lose me sure she would
break her heart and die my plight wa desper i knew not what to do
then of a sudden while i waver some voic seem to whisper in my
ear i thought it must be that of st hubert it seem to sai to me
kari trust to hi god cannot you trust to your hubert of hast
you who ar a christian man go forward and trust to your hubert of
hast
kari gentl voic di awai he had finish hi speech and all men
look at me
what word i said roughli to my captain
onli thi lord answer their spokesman fight you must of that
there can be no doubt but we would fight with you the ten of the
chanca against the ten of the quichua
ay that is good repli the first of kari nobl thi busi
is too great to set upon on man skill and strength
have done i said it li between the inca and myself while kari
nod and repeat have done after me
then i sent on of the captain back to the camp for my sword and kari
command that hi should be brought to him sinc accord to the
custom of these peopl when ambassador meet neither of us wa arm
present the captain hold my sword return and with him servant
who brought my armour also after them stream all the armi of the
chanca among whom the new had spread like winddriven fire and line
themselv upon the ridg to watch as he came too i notic that thi
captain sharpen waveflam with a certain kind of stone that wa us
to give a keen edg to weapon
he brought the ancient weapon and hand it to me on hi knee the
inca man also brought hi sword and hand it to him as he did so
bow hi forehead to the dust well i knew that weapon sinc onc
befor i had face it in desper battl for my life it wa the
ivoryhandl sword of the lord deleroi which kari had taken from hi
dead hand after i slew him in the solar of my hous in the cheap at
london then the servant came to me with the armour but i sent him
awai sai that as the inca had none i would not wear it at which my
peopl murmur
kari saw and heard
nobl as ever he said aloud oh that such bright honour should have
been tarnish by a woman breath
our lord discuss the manner of our fight but to them i paid
littl heed
at length all wa readi and we step forward to face each other at a
given word clad much alik i had thrown off my outer garment and stood
barehead in a jerkin of soft sheepskin kari too wa strip of hi
splendid dress and clad in a tunic of sheepskin also that we might
be quit equal he had taken off hi turbanlik headgear and even the
royal fring whereat hi lord stare at each other for thei thought
thi a bad omen
it wa just then i heard a sound behind me and turn my head i saw
quilla stumbl toward us down the stoni slope as best her halfblind
ey would let her and cry as she came
oh my lord fight not inca i will return to the hous of the sun
silenc accurs woman said kari frown doe the sun take back
such as you silenc until the woe that you have wrought is finish
and then wail on forev
she shrank back at hi bitter unjust word and guid by the women who
had follow her sank upon a stone where she sat still as a statu or
as dead upanqui in hi hall
now on call aloud the pledg of the fight which were as kari had
spoken them he listen and ad
be it known also that thi battl is to the death of on or both of
us sinc if we live i take back my oath and i will burn yonder witch
as a sacrific to the sun whom she ha betrai and destroi her peopl
and her citi accord to the ancient law of vengeanc on the hous of
those who have deceiv the sun
i heard but made no answer who did not wish to wast my breath in
bandi word with a great man whose brain had been turn by bigotri
and womanhatr
a moment later the signal wa given and we were at it kari leapt at me
like the treelion of hi own forest but i avoid and parri thrice
he leapt and thrice i did thi ye even when i saw an open and
might have cut him down almost i struck then could not the chanca
watch me wonder what game i plai who wa not wont to fight
in thi fashion and i also wonder who still knew not what to do
someth i must do or present i should be slain sinc soon my guard
would fail and deleroi sword get home at last
i think that kari grew perplex at thi patient defenc of mine and
never a blow struck back at least he withdraw a littl then came for
me with a rush hold hi sword high abov hi head with the purpos
of strike me abov that guard or so i suppos then of a sudden i
knew what to do wheel waveflam with all my strength in both hand
i smote not at kari but at the ivori handl of hi sword the keen and
ancient steel that might well have been some of that which as legend
told wa forg by the dwarf in norseland fell upon the ivori between
hi handgrip and the crosspiec and shore through it as i had hope
that it would do so that the blade of kari sword sever just abov
the hilt fell to the ground and the hilt itself wa jar from hi
hand
hi nobl saw and groan while the chanca shout with joi for now
kari wa defenceless and save for the death itself thi fight to the
death wa end
kari fold hi arm upon hi breast and bent hi head
it is the decre of my god he said and i did ill to trust to the
sword of a villain whom you slew strike conqueror and make an end
i rest myself upon waveflam and answer
if i strike not o inca will you take back your word and let peac
reign between your peopl and the chanca
nai he answer what i have said i have said if yonder fals
woman is given up to suffer the fate of those who have betrai the sun
then there shall be peac between the peopl but not otherwis sinc
while i live i will wage war upon her and you and upon the chanca who
shelter both of you
now rage took hold of me who rememb that while thi womanhat
live blood must flow in stream but that if he di there would be
peac and quilla would be safe so i lift my sword a littl and as i
did so quilla rose from her stone and stumbl forward cry
o lord shed not the inca holi blood for me let me be given up let
me be given up
then some spirit enter into me and i spoke sai
ladi half of your prayer i grant and half i deni i will not shed the
inca blood as soon would i shed your nor will i suffer you to be
given up who have done no wrong sinc it wa i who took you awai by
forc as urco would have done kari hearken to me not onc onli when
we were in danger togeth in past dai have you said to me that we
must put our faith in the god we worship and thu we did now again i
hearken to that counsel of your and put my faith in the god i worship
you threaten to gather all the strength of your mighti empir and
becaus of what i hold to be your superstit to destroi the chanca
peopl to the last babe and to level their citi to the last stone i
do not believ that the god i worship will suffer thi to come about
though how he will stai your vengeanc i do not know kari great
inca of tavantinsuyu lord of all thi strang new world i the white
wandererfromthesea give you your life and save you as onc befor
i save you in a far land and with your life i give you my bless in
all matter but thi on alon kari my brother look your last on me
and go in peac
the inca heard and rais hi head stare at me with hi fine
melancholi ey then suddenli from those ey there came a gush of
tear more he knelt befor me and kiss the ground as the humblest
of hi slave might do befor hi own majesti
most nobl of men he said lift himself up again i worship you
ye i the inca worship you would that i might take back my oath but
thi i cannot do becaus my god harden my heart and then would decre
destruct on my peopl mayhap he whom you serv will bring thing to
pass as you foretel as it would seem he ha brought it to pass that
i should eat the dust befor you i hope that it mai be so who love
not the sight of blood but who like the shot arrow must yet follow my
cours driven by the strength that loos me brother honour and
belov fare you well mai happi be your in life and death and
there in death mai we meet again and onc more be brother where no
women come to part us
then kari turn and went with bow head togeth with hi nobl who
follow him as sadli as those who surround a corps but not until thei
had given to me that royal salut which is onli render to the inca in
hi glori
chapter xiii
the kiss of quilla
her women bore quilla swoon from that illfat field and sick and
sad she remain until onc more we saw the citi of the chanca yet all
thi while strength and sight were return to her ey so that in
the end she could see as well as ever she had done for which i thank
heaven
messeng had gone befor us so that when we drew near all the peopl
of the chanca came out to meet us a mighti multitud who spread
flower befor us and sang song of joi on the same even i wa
summon by huaracha and found him dy there in the presenc of
hi chief captain quilla and i told him all our stori to which he
listen answer noth when it wa finish he said
i thank you lordfromthesea who through great peril have save my
daughter and brought her home to bid farewel to me untarnish as
she went i understand now that it wa an evil polici which led me to
promis her in marriag to the princ urco through your valour it ha
come to naught and i am glad great danger still lie ahead of you and
of my peopl deal with them as you will and can for henceforward
lordfromthesea thei ar your peopl your and my daughter
togeth sinc it is my desir and command that you two should wed so
soon as i am laid with my father perchanc it had been better if you
had slain the inca when he wa in your hand but man goe where hi
spirit lead him my bless and the bless of my god be on you both
and on your children leav me for i can sai no more
that night king huaracha di
three dai later he wa buri with great pomp beneath the floor of the
templ of the moon not be preserv and kept abov ground after the
fashion of the inca
on the last dai of the mourn a council wa summon of all the great
on in the countri to the number of sever hundr to which i wa
bidden thi wa done in the name of quilla who wa now name by a
titl which meant high ladi or queen i went to it eagerli enough
who had seen noth of her sinc that night of her father death
for accord to the custom of thi peopl she had spent the time of
mourn alon with her women
to my surpris i wa led by an offic not into the great hall where i
knew the notabl were assembl but to that same littl chamber where
first i had talk with huaracha quilla father here the offic
left me wonder present i heard a sound and look up saw quilla
herself stand between the curtain like to a pictur in it frame
she wa royal arrai and wore upon her brow and breast the emblem
of the moon so that she seem to glitter in that duski place though
noth about her shone with such a light as did her larg and doelik
ey
greet my lord she said in her soft voic curtsei to me as she
spoke ha my lord aught to sai to me if so it must be quick sinc
the great council wait
now i grew foolish and tongueti but at length stammer out
noth except what i have said beforethat i love you
she smile a littl in her slow fashion then ask
is there naught to add
what can there be to add to love quilla
i know not she answer still smile yet in what doe the love of
man and woman end
i shook my head and answer
in mani thing all of them differ in hell sometim and more
rare in heaven
and on earth which li between the two should those who love escap
death and separ
well on earthin marriag
she look at me again and thi time a new light shone in her ey which
i could not misinterpret
do you mean that you will marri me quilla i mutter
such wa my father wish lord but what is your oh have done she
went on in a chang voic for what have we suffer all these thing
and gone through such long part and danger so dread wa it not
that if fate should spare us we might come togeth at last and ha not
fate spare usfor a while what said the propheci of me in the templ
of rimac wa it not that the sun should be my refug andi forget the
rest
i rememb it i said that in the belov arm you should sleep at
last
ye she went on the blood mount to her cheek that in the
belov arm i should sleep at last so the first part of the propheci
ha come true
as the rest shall come true i broke in awak and swept her to my
breast
ar you sure she murmur present that you love me a woman whom
you think savag well enough to wed me
ay more than sure i answer
hearken lord i knew it alwai but be woman i desir to hear it
from your own lip of thi be certain that though i am but what i am
a maiden wildheart and untaught no man shall ever have a truer and
more love wife it is my hope even that my love will be such that in
it at last you mai learn to forget that other ladi far awai who onc wa
your if onli for an hour
now i shrank as from a sword prick sinc first love whatev the tale
of them as quilla guess or natur taught her ar not easili forgot
and even when thei ar dead their ghost will rise and haunt us
and my hope most dear is that you will be mine not for an hour but
for all our life dai i answer
ay she said sigh but who know how mani these will be
therefor let us pluck the flower befor thei wither i hear step the
lord come to summon us be pleas to enter the council at my side and
hold me by the hand there i have somewhat to sai to the peopl the
shadow of the inca kari whom you spare still li cold upon us and
them
befor i could ask her mean the lord enter three of them and
glanc at us curious said that all were gather then thei turn
and went befor us to the great hall where everi place wa fill hand
in hand we mount the dai and as we came all the audienc rose and
greet us with a roar of welcom
quilla seat herself upon a throne and motion to me to take my place
upon anoth throne at her side which i note stood a littl higher
than that on which she sat and thi as i learn afterward not
by chanc it wa plan so to tell the peopl of the chanca that
henceforth i wa their king while she wa but my wife
when the shout had di awai quilla rose from her throne and began to
speak which like mani of the higher class of thi peopl she could do
well enough
lord and captain of the chanca nation she said my father the
king huaracha be dead leav no law son i have succeed to
hi digniti and summon you here to take counsel with me
first learn thi that i your queen and ladi have been chosen as
wife by him who sit at my side
here the compani shout again thu announc that thi tide
pleas them for though by now onli the common peopl still believ me
to be a god risen from the sea all held that i wa a great gener and
a great man on who knew much that thei did not know and who could
both lead and fight better than the best of them inde sinc i had
slain urco with my hand and overcom kari who as inca wa believ to
be cloth with the strength of the sun and therefor unconquer
i wa held to be unmatch throughout tavantinsuyu moreov the armi
that had fought under my command love me as though i were their father
as well as their gener therefor all greet thi tide well enough
without astonish for thei knew it wa their dead king wish that i
should wed hi daughter and that to win her i had gone through much
in answer to their shout i too rose from my seat and draw the
sword waveflam which i wore girt about my dint armour with it i
salut first quilla and then the gather nobl sai
lord of the chanca when on an island in the sea my ey fell upon
thi ladi who todai is your queen i love her and swore that i would
wed her if i might between that dai and thi much ha befallen she wa
snatch awai to be made the wife of urco heir to the inca throne and
afterward to escap him whom she hate she took refug in the hous
of the inca god then peopl of the chanca came the great war which
we share togeth and in the end i rescu her from that hous of
bondag and slew urco while he strove to steal or stab her thi done
i conquer kari the inca who wa as my brother yet becaus i save
your ladi from hi god the sun becam my enemi and togeth she and
i return to thi her land now it is her will to wed me as it ha
alwai been mine to wed her and here in front of all of you i take her
to wife as she take me to husband hope that for mani year it mai

warn you that although in the great war that ha been if with much
loss we have held our own against all the host of cuzco and won an
honour peac by thi marriag of our which rob the inca god of

as in the past there will be war between the quichua and the chanca
peopl
we know it shout the nobl war is decre let war come
what would you have had me do i went on leav your queen to
languish in the hous of the sun wed to nothing or suffer her to
be drag awai to be on of urco women or hand her back to kari to
be slain as a sacrific to a god whom you do not accept
nai thei cri we would have her wed you white lordfromthesea
that she mai becom a mother of king
so i thought chanca yet i warn you that there is troubl near the
storm gather and soon it will burst sinc kari is not on who break
hi oath
why did you not kill him when he wa in your hand and take hi
throne ask on
becaus i could not becaus it would not have been pleas to heaven
that i should slai a man who for year had been as my brother becaus
in thi wai or in that the deed would have fallen back upon my head
upon the head of the ladi quilla and upon your head also o peopl of
the chanca becaus
at thi moment there wa disturb at the end of the hall and a
herald cri

live beneath the sun and not on stone mark where your citi stood it
mai be that a while will pass befor thi sword of war fall upon your
head sinc the inca must gather hi armi and give a breath space
to hi peopl after all the troubl that have been yet if not thi
year then next year and if not next year then the year after that
sword shall fall
quilla listen and turn pale though more i think with wrath than
fear then she said
you have heard chanca and know how stand thi case if i surrend
myself to be sacrif the inca in hi merci will spare you if i do
not surrend myself soon or late he will destroi youif he can sai
then shall i surrend myself
now everi man in that great hall leapt up and from everi throat there
aros a shout of

upanqui should yet lose both throne and life and with them the ancient
empir of the sun thu sai we all

wall
in the silenc that follow quilla ask
have you aught to add o ambassador
ay thi said the first of them
the chanca tree is about to be cut down but the inca still offer a
refug to the lion that hide among it branch becaus he ha love
