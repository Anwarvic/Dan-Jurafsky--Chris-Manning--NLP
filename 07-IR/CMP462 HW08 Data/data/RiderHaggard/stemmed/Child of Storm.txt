dear mr stuart
for twenti year i believ i am right in sai you as assist
secretari for nativ affair in natal and in other offic have been
intim acquaint with the zulu peopl moreov you ar on of
the few live men who have made a deep and scientif studi of their
languag their custom and their histori so i confess that i wa the
more pleas after you were so good as to read thi taleth
second book of the epic of the vengeanc of zikali the
thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn and of the fall of the hous of
senzangakonawhen you wrote to me that it wa anim by the true
zulu spirit
mari wa the first the third and final act in the
drama is yet to come
i must admit that my acquaint with thi peopl date from a period
which close almost befor your dai what i know of them i gather
at the time when cetewayo of whom my volum tell wa in hi glori
previou to the evil hour in which he found himself driven by the
clamour of hi regiment cut off as thei were through the annex
of the transvaal from their hereditari trade of war to match himself
against the british strength i learn it all by person observ
in the seventi or from the lip of the great shepston my chief and
friend and from my colleagu osborn fynnei clark and other everi
on of them long sinc gone down
perhap it mai be as well that thi is so at ani rate in the case of
on who desir to write of the zulu as a reign nation which now
thei have ceas to be and to try to show them as thei were in all
their superstiti mad and bloodstain grandeur
yet then thei had virtu as well as vice to serv their countri in
arm to die for it and for the king such wa their primit ideal if
thei were fierc thei were loyal and fear neither wound nor doom if
thei listen to the dark rede of the witchdoctor the trumpetcal
of duti sound still louder in their ear if chant their terribl
ingoma at the king bid thei went forth to slai unsparingli at
least thei were not mean or vulgar from those who continu must face
the last great issu of life or death mean and vulgar ar
far remov these qualiti belong to the safe and crowd haunt of
civilis men not to the kraal of bantu savag where at ani rate of
old thei might be sought in vain
now everyth is chang or so i hear and doubtless in the balanc
thi is best still we mai wonder what ar the thought that pass
through the mind of some ancient warrior of chaka or dingaan time
as he sun himself crouch on the ground for exampl where onc stood
the royal kraal duguza and watch men and women of the zulu blood
pass homeward from the citi or the mine bemus some of them
with the white man smuggl liquor grotesqu with the white man
castoff garment hide perhap in their blanket exampl of the
white man doubt photographsand then shut hi sunken ey and
rememb the plume and kilt regiment make that same ground shake
as with a thunder of salut line upon line compani upon compani thei
rush out to battl
well becaus the latter doe not attract me it is of thi former time
that i have tri to writeth time of the impi and the witchfind
and the rival princ of the royal housea i am glad to learn from
you not quit in vain therefor sinc you so great an expert
approv of my labour in the seldomtravel field of zulu stori i ask
you to allow me to set your name upon thi page and subscrib myself
gratefulli and sincer your

author note
mr allan quatermain stori of the wick and fascin mameena
a kind of zulu helen ha it should be state a broad foundat in
histor fact leav mameena and her wile on on side the tale of
the struggl between the princ cetewayo and umbelazi for success to
the throne of zululand is true
when the differ between these son of hi becam intoler
becaus of the tumult which thei were caus in hi countri king
panda their father the son of senzangakona and the brother of the
great chaka and of dingaan who had rule befor him did sai that when
two young bull quarrel thei had better fight it out so at least i
wa told by the late mr f b fynnei my colleagu at the time of the
annex of the transvaal in 1877 who as zulu border agent with the
except of the late sir theophilu shepston and the late sir melmoth
osborn perhap knew more of that land and peopl than anyon els of
hi period
as a result of thi hint given by a madden king the great battl of
the tugela wa fought at endondakusuka in decemb 1856 between the
usutu parti command by cetewayo and the adher of umbelazi
the handsom hi brother who wa known among the zulu as
indhlovuenesihlonti or the eleph with the tuft of hair from a
littl lock of hair which grew low down upon hi back
my friend sir melmoth osborn who di in or about the year 1897 wa
present at thi battl although not as a combat well do i rememb
hi thrill stori told to me over thirti year ago of the event of
that aw dai
earli in the morn or dure the previou night i forget which he
swam hi hors across the tugela and hid with it in a bushclad kopj
blindfold the anim with hi coat lest it should betrai him as it
chanc the great fight of the dai that of the regiment of veteran
which sir melmoth inform me panda had sent down at the last moment to
the assist of umbelazi hi favourit son took place almost at
the foot of thi kopj mr quatermain in hi narr call thi
regiment the amawomb but my recollect is that the name sir melmoth
osborn gave them wa the grei or upunga
whatev their exact titl mai have been howev thei made a great
stand at least he told me that when umbelazi impi or armi began to
give befor the usutu onslaught these grei move forward abov 3000
strong drawn up in a tripl line and were charg by on of cetewayo
regiment
the oppos forc met and the nois of their clash shield said
sir melmoth wa like the roll of heavi thunder then while he watch
the veteran grei pass over the oppos regiment as a wave pass
over a rockthes were hi exact wordsand leav about a third of
their number dead or wound among the bodi of the annihil foe
charg on to meet a second regiment sent against them by cetewayo with
these the struggl wa repeat but again the grei conquer onli
now there were not more than five or six hundr of them left upon their
feet
these survivor ran to a mound round which thei form a ring and
here for a long while withstood the attack of a third regiment until
at length thei perish almost to a man buri beneath heap of their
slain assail the usutu
truli thei made a nobl end fight thu against tremend odd
as for the number who fell at thi battl of endondakusuka mr fynnei
in a pamphlet which he wrote sai that six of umbelazi brother di
whilst it is estim that upward of 100000 of the peoplemen
women and childrenwer slaina high and inde an imposs
estim
that curiou personag name john dunn an englishman who becam a
zulu chief and who actual fought in thi battl as narrat by mr
quatermain howev put the number much lower what the true total wa
will never be known but sir melmoth osborn told me that when he swam
hi hors back across the tugela that night it wa black with bodi
and sir theophilu shepston also told me that when he visit the scene
a dai or two later the bank of the river were strewn with multitud of
them male and femal
it wa from mr fynnei that i heard the stori of the execut by
cetewayo of the man who appear befor him with the ornament of
umbelazi announc that he had kill the princ with hi own hand
of cours thi tale as mr quatermain point out bear a strike
resembl to that record in the old testament in connect with the
death of king saul
it by no mean follow howev that it is therefor apocryph
inde mr fynnei assur me that it wa quit true although if he
gave me hi author i cannot rememb them after a laps of more
than thirti year
the exact circumst of umbelazi death ar unknown but the gener
report wa that he di not by the assegai of the usutu but of a
broken heart anoth stori declar that he wa drown hi bodi wa
never found and it is therefor probabl that it sank in the tugela as
is suggest in the follow page
i have onli to add that it is quit in accord with zulu belief
that a man should be haunt by the ghost of on whom he ha murder
or betrai or to be more accur that the spirit umoya should
enter into the slayer and drive him mad or in such a case that spirit
might bring misfortun upon him hi famili or hi tribe

chapter i allan quatermain hear of mameena
we white peopl think that we know everyth for instanc we think
that we understand human natur and so we do as human natur appear
to us with all it trap and accessori seen dimli through the
glass of our convent leav out those aspect of it which we have
forgotten or do not think it polit to mention but i allan quatermain
reflect upon these matter in my ignor and uneduc fashion
have alwai held that no on realli understand human natur who ha
not studi it in the rough well that is the aspect of it with which i
have been best acquaint
for most of the year of my life i have handl the raw materi the
virgin or not the finish ornament that is smelt out of itif
inde it is finish yet which i greatli doubt i dare sai that a
time mai come when the perfect generationsif civilis as we
understand it realli ha a futur and ani such should be allow
to enjoi their hour on the worldwil look back to us as crude
halfdevelop creatur whose onli merit wa that we hand on the
flame of life
mayb mayb for everyth goe by comparison and at on end of the
ladder is the apeman and at the other as we hope the angel no not
the angel he belong to a differ sphere but that last express
of human upon which i will not specul while man is manthat is
befor he suffer the magic deathchang into spirit if such should
be hi destinywel he will remain man i mean that the same passion
will swai him he will aim at the same ambit he will know the same
joi and be oppress by the same fear whether he live in a kafir
hut or in a golden palac whether he walk upon hi two feet or as for
aught i know he mai do on dai fli through the air thi is certain
that in the flesh he can never escap from our atmospher and while
he breath it in the main with some variat prescrib by climat
local law and religion he will do much as hi forefath did for
countless ag
that is why i have alwai found the savag so interest for in him
nakedli and forcibl express we see those etern principl which
direct our human destini
to descend from these gener that is why also i who hate
write have thought it worth while at the cost of some labour to
myself to occupi my leisur in what to me is a strang landfor
although i wa born in england it is not my countryin set down
variou experi of my life that do in my opinion interpret thi
our univers natur i dare sai that no on will ever read them still
perhap thei ar worthi of record and who know in dai to come thei
mai fall into the hand of other and prove of valu at ani rate thei
ar true stori of interest peopl who if thei should surviv in
the savag competit of the nation probabl ar doom to undergo
great chang therefor i tell of them befor thei began to chang
now although i take it out of it strict chronolog order the first
of these histori that i wish to preserv is in the main that of an
extrem beauti womanwith the except of a certain nada call
the lili of whom i hope to speak some dai i think the most beauti
that ever live among the zulu also she wa i think the most abl
the most wick and the most ambiti her attract namefor it wa
veri attract as the zulu said it especi those of them who were
in love with herwa mameena daughter of umbezi her other name
wa child of storm inganeyesipepo or more freeli and shortli
owezulu but the word mameena had it origin in the sound of the
wind that wail about the hut when she wa born
the zulu word meenaor more correctli minamean
come here and would therefor be a name not unsuit to
on of the heroin procliv but mr quatermain doe
not seem to accept thi interpretationeditor
sinc i have been settl in england i have readof cours in a
translationth stori of helen of troi as told by the greek poet
homer well mameena remind me veri much of helen or rather helen
remind me of mameena at ani rate there wa thi in common between
them although on of them wa black or rather coppercolour
and the other whitethei both were love moreov thei both were
faithless and brought men by hundr to their death there perhap
the resembl end sinc mameena had much more fire and grit than
helen could boast who unless homer misrepres her must have been
but a poor thing after all beauti itself which those old rascal of
greek god made us of to bait their snare set for the live and honour
of men such wa helen no more that is as i understand her who have
not had the advantag of a classic educ now mameena although
she wa superstitiousa common weak of great mindsacknowledg
no god in particular as we understand them set her own snare with
vari success but a veri definit object name that of becom the
first woman in the world as she knew itth stormi bloodstain world
of the zulu
but the reader shall judg for himself if ever such a person should
chanc to cast hi ey upon thi histori
it wa in the year 1854 that i first met mameena and my acquaint
with her continu off and on until 1856 when it came to an end in a
fashion that shall be told after the fear battl of the tugela in
which umbelazi panda son and cetewayo brotherwho to hi sorrow
had also met mameenalost hi life i wa still a youngish man in
those dai although i had alreadi buri my second wife as i have told
elsewher after our brief but happi time of marriag
leav my boi in charg of some kind peopl in durban i start into
the zulua land with which i had alreadi becom well acquaint as a
youth there to carri on my wild life of trade and hunt
for the trade i never care much as mai be guess from the littl
that ever i made out of it the art of traffic be in truth repugn
to me but hunt wa alwai the breath of my nostrilsnot that i am
fond of kill creatur for ani human man soon weari of slaughter
no it is the excit of sport which befor breechload came in
wa acut enough i can assur you the lone exist in wild place
often with onli the sun and the star for companion the continu
adventur the strang tribe with whom i came in contact in short
the chang the danger the hope alwai of find someth great and
new that attract and still attract me even now when i have found
the great and the new there i must not go on write like thi or i
shall throw down my pen and book a passag for africa and incident
to the next world no doubtthat world of the great and new
it wa i think in the month of mai in the year 1854 that i went
hunt in rough countri between the white and black umvolosi river by
permiss of pandawhom the boer had made king of zululand after the
defeat and death of dingaan hi brother the district wa veri feverish
and for thi reason i had enter it in the winter month there wa so
much bush that in the total absenc of road i thought it wise not
to attempt to bring my wagon down and as no hors would live in
that veld i went on foot my princip companion were a kafir of mix
origin call sikauli commonli abbrevi into scowl the zulu chief
saduko and a headman of the undwandw blood name umbezi at whose
kraal on the high land about thirti mile awai i left my wagon and
certain of my men in charg of the good and some ivori that i had
trade
thi umbezi wa a stout and genialmann man of about sixti year of
ag and what is rare among these peopl on who love sport for it
own sake be awar of hi tast also that he knew the countri
and wa skill in find game i had promis him a gun if he would
accompani me and bring a few hunter it wa a particularli bad gun that
had seen much servic and on which had an unpleas habit of go
off at halfcock but even after he had seen it and i in my honesti had
explain it weak he jump at the offer
o macumazana that is my nativ name often abbrevi into
macumazahn which mean on who stand out or as mani interpret it i
dont know how watcherbynighta gun that goe off sometim when
you do not expect it is much better than no gun at all and you ar a
chief with a great heart to promis it to me for when i own the white
man weapon i shall be look up to and fear by everyon between the
two river
now while he wa speak he handl the gun that wa load
observ which i move behind him off it went in due cours it
recoil knock him backwardsfor that gun wa a devil to kickand it
bullet cut the top off the ear of on of hi wive the ladi fled
scream leav a littl bit of her ear upon the ground
what doe it matter said umbezi as he pick himself up rub hi
shoulder with a rueful look would that the evil spirit in the gun had
cut off her tongu and not her ear it is the wornoutoldcow own
fault she is alwai peep into everyth like a monkei now she will
have someth to chatter about and leav my thing alon for awhil i
thank my ancestr spirit it wa not mameena for then her look would
have been spoil
who is mameena i ask your last wife
no no macumazahn i wish she were for then i should have the most
beauti wife in the land she is my daughter though not that of the
wornoutoldcow her mother di when she wa born on the night of the
great storm you should ask saduko there who mameena is he ad with
a broad grin lift hi head from the gun which he wa examin
gingerli as though he thought it might go off again while unload and
nod toward someon who stood behind him
i turn and for the first time saw saduko whom i recognis at onc
as a person quit out of the ordinari run of nativ
he wa a tall and magnific form young man who although hi
breast wa scar with assegai wound show that he wa a warrior
had not yet attain to the honour of the ring of polish wax laid
over strip of rush bound round with sinew and sewn to the hair the
isicoco which at a certain ag or digniti determin by the king
zulu ar allow to assum but hi face struck me more even than hi
grace strength and statur undoubtedli it wa a veri fine face with
littl or noth of the negroid type about it inde he might have
been a rather darkcolour arab to which stock he probabl threw back
the ey too were larg and rather melancholi and in hi reserv
dignifi air there wa someth that show him to be no common
fellow but on of breed and intellect
siyakubona that is we see you anglic good morrow saduko i
said ey him curious tell me who is mameena
inkoosi he answer in hi deep voic lift hi delic shape
hand in salut a courtesi that pleas me who after all wa
noth but a white hunter inkoosi ha not her father said that she
is hi daughter
ay answer the jolli old umbezi but what her father ha not said
is that saduko is her lover or rather would like to be wow saduko
he went on shake hi fat finger at him ar you mad man that you
think a girl like that is for you give me a hundr cattl not on
less and i will begin to think of it why you have not ten and
mameena is my eldest daughter and must marri a rich man
she love me o umbezi answer saduko look down and that is
more than cattl
for you perhap saduko but not for me who am poor and want cow
also he ad glanc at him shrewdli ar you so sure that mameena
love you though you be such a fine man now i should have thought that
whatev her ey mai sai her heart love no on but herself and
that in the end she will follow her heart and not her ey mameena the
beauti doe not seek to be a poor man wife and do all the hoe
but bring me the hundr cattl and we will see for speak truth
from my heart if you were a big chief there is no on i should like
better as a soninlaw unless it were macumazahn here he said
dig me in the rib with hi elbow who would lift up my hous on
hi white back
now at thi speech saduko shift hi feet uneasili it seem to me
as though he felt there wa truth in umbezi estim of hi daughter
charact but he onli said
cattl can be acquir
or stolen suggest umbezi
or taken in war correct saduko when i have a hundr head i will
hold you to your word o father of mameena
and then what would you live on fool if you gave all your beast to
me there there ceas talk wind befor you have a hundr head of
cattl mameena will have six children who will not call you father
ah dont you like that ar you go awai
ye i am go he answer with a flash of hi quiet ey onli
then let the man whom thei do call father bewar of saduko
bewar of how you talk young man said umbezi in a grave voic
would you travel your father road i hope not for i like you well
but such word ar apt to be rememb
saduko walk awai as though he did not hear
who is he i ask
on of high blood answer umbezi shortli he might be a chief
todai had not hi father been a plotter and a wizard dingaan smelt him
outand he made a sidewai motion with hi hand that among the zulu
mean much ye thei were kill almost everi on the chief hi
wive hi children and hi headmeneveri on except chosa

mai aveng matiwan
a nice tale i said but what happen afterward
zikali took me awai and nurtur me at hi kraal in the black kloof
where he live alon save for hi servant for in that kraal he would
suffer no woman to set foot macumazahn he taught me much wisdom and
mani secret thing and would have made a great doctor of me had i so
will but i will it not who find spirit ill compani and there ar
mani of them about the black kloof macumazahn so in the end he said
go where your heart call and be a warrior saduko but know thi
you have open a door that can never be shut again and across the
threshold of that door spirit will pass in and out for all your life
whether you seek them or seek them not
it wa you who open the door zikali i answer angrili
mayhap said zikali laugh after hi fashion for i open when i
must and shut when i must inde in my youth befor the zulu were a
peopl thei name me open of door and now look through on of
those door i see someth about you o son of matiwan
what do you see my father i ask
i see two road saduko the road of medicin that is the spirit
road and the road of spear that is the blood road i see you
travel on the road of medicin that is my own road saduko and
grow wise and great till at last far far awai you vanish over the
precipic to which it lead full of year and honour and wealth fear
yet belov by all men white and black onli that road you must travel
alon sinc such wisdom mai have no friend and abov all no woman
to share it secret then i look at the road of spear and see you
saduko travel on that road and your feet ar red with blood and
women wind their arm about your neck and on by on your enemi go
down befor you you love much and sin much for the sake of the love
and she for whom you sin come and goe and come again and the road is
short saduko and near the end of it ar mani spirit and though you
shut your ey you see them and though you fill your ear with clai you
hear them for thei ar the ghost of your slain but the end of your
journei i see not now choos which road you will son of matiwan
and choos swiftli for i speak no more of thi matter
then macumazahn i thought a while of the safe and lone path of
wisdom also of the bloodr path of spear where i should find love
and war and my youth rose up in me andi chose the path of spear and
the love and the sin and the unknown death
a foolish choic saduko suppos that there is ani truth in thi
tale of road which there is not
nai a wise on macumazahn for sinc then i have seen mameena and
know why i chose that path
ah i said mameenai forgot her well after all perhap there is
some truth in your tale of road when i have seen mameena i will tell
you what i think
when you have seen mameena macumazahn you will sai that the choic
wa veri wise well zikali open of door laugh loudli when he
heard it the ox seek the fat pastur but the young bull the rough
mountainsid where the heifer graze he said and after all a
bull is better than an ox now begin to travel your own road son of
matiwan and from time to time return to the black kloof and tell me
how it fare with you i will promis you not to die befor i know the
end of it

macumazana why do you also wish to drink of the moonshin of zikali
and he went
yet i did not sleep veri well that night for saduko and hi strang and
terribl stori had taken a hold of my imagin also for reason of
my own i greatli wish to see thi zikali of whom i had heard a great
deal in past year i wish further to find out if he wa a common
humbug like so mani witchdoctor thi dwarf who announc that my
fortun were mix up with those of hi fosterson and who at least
could tell me someth true or fals about the histori and posit
of bangu a person for whom i had conceiv a strong dislik possibl
quit unjustifi by the fact but more than all did i wish to see
mameena whose beauti or talent produc so much impress upon the
nativ mind perhap if i went to see zikali she would be back at her
father kraal befor we start on our shoot trip
thu it wa then that fate wove me and my do into the web of some
veri strang event terribl tragic and complet inde as those of a
greek plai as it ha often done both befor and sinc those dai
chapter ii the moonshin of zikali
on the follow morn i awok as a good hunter alwai should do
just at that time when on look out of the wagon noth can be seen
but a littl grei glint of light which he know is reflect from the
horn of the cattl ti to the trektow present howev i saw
anoth glint of light which i guess came from the spear of saduko
who wa seat by the ash of the cook fire wrap in hi kaross
of wildcat skin slip from the voorkiss or drivingbox i came
behind him softli and touch him on the shoulder he leapt up with a
start which reveal hi nervou natur then recognis me through the
soft grei gloom said
you ar earli macumazahn
of cours i answer am i not name watcherbynight now let us
go to umbezi and tell him that i shall be readi to start on our hunt
trip on the third morn from todai
so we went to find that umbezi wa in a hut with hi last wife and
asleep fortun enough howev as under the circumst i did
not wish to disturb him outsid the hut we found the old cow whose
sore ear had kept her veri wide awak who for purpos of her own
although etiquett did not allow her to enter the hut wa wait for
her husband to emerg
have examin her wound and rub some ointment on it with her i
left my messag next i woke up my servant scowl and told him that i
wa go on a short journei and that he must guard all thing until my
return and while i did so took a nip of raw rum and made readi a bag
of biltong that is sundri flesh and biscuit
then take with me a singlebarrel gun that same littl purdei
rifl with which i shot the vultur on the hill of slaughter at
dingaan kraal we start on foot for i would not risk my onli
hors on such a journei
for the stori of thi shoot of the vultur by allan
quatermain see the book call marieeditor
a rough journei it prove to be inde over a seri of bushclad hill
that at their crest were cover with rug stone among which no
hors could have travel up and down these hill we went and across
the vallei that divid them follow some path which i could not
see for all that livelong dai i have alwai been held a good walker
be by natur veri light and activ but i am bound to sai that my
companion tax my power to the utmost for on he march for hour
after hour stride ahead of me at such a rate that at time i wa
forc to break into a run to keep up with him although my pride would
not suffer me to complain sinc as a matter of principl i would never
admit to a kafir that he wa my master at anyth glad enough wa i
when toward even saduko sat himself down on a stone at the top of
a hill and said
behold the black kloof macumazahn which were almost the first word
he had utter sinc we start
truli the spot wa well name for there cut out by water from the
heart of a mountain in some primev ag lai on of the most gloomi
place that ever i had beheld it wa a vast cleft in which granit
boulder were pile up fantast perch on upon anoth in great
column and upon it side grew dark tree set spars among the
rock it face toward the west but the light of the sink sun that
flow up it serv onli to accentu it vast loneli for it wa a
big cleft the best part of a mile wide at it mouth
up thi dreari gorg we march mock at by chatter baboon and
follow a littl path not a foot wide that led us at length to a larg
hut and sever smaller on set within a reed fenc and overhung by a
gigant mass of rock that look as though it might fall at ani moment
at the gate of the fenc two nativ of i know not what tribe men of
fierc and forbid appear suddenli sprang out and thrust their
spear toward my breast
whom bring you here saduko ask on of them sternli
a white man that i vouch for he answer tell zikali that we wait
on him
what need to tell zikali that which he know alreadi said the sentri
your food and that of your companion is alreadi cook in yonder hut
enter saduko with him for whom you vouch
so we went into the hut and at also i wash myself for it wa a
beautifulli clean hut and the stool wooden bowl etc were fine
carv out of red ivori wood thi work saduko inform me be done
by zikali own hand just as we were finish our meal a messeng
came to tell us that zikali wait our presenc we follow him across
an open space to a kind of door in the tall reed fenc pass which i
set ey for the first time upon the famou old witchdoctor of whom so
mani tale were told
certainli he wa a curiou sight in those strang surround for thei
were veri strang and i think their complet simplic ad to the
effect in front of us wa a kind of courtyard with a black floor made
of polish antheap earth and cowdung twothird of which at least
wa practic roof in by the huge overhang mass of rock whereof
i have spoken it arch bend abov at a height of not less than
sixti or seventi feet from the ground into thi great precipiceback
caviti pour the fierc light of the set sun turn it and all
within it even the larg straw hut in the background to the deep hue
of blood see the wonder effect of the sunset in that dark and
forbid place it occur to me at onc that the old wizard must
have chosen thi moment to receiv us becaus of it impress
then i forgot these scenic accessori in the sight of the man himself
there he sat on a stool in front of hi hut quit unattend and
wear onli a cloak of leopard skin open in front for he wa
unadorn with the usual hideou trap of a witchdoctor such as
snakeskin human bone bladder full of unholi compound and so
forth
what a man he wa if inde he could be call quit human hi
statur though stout wa onli that of a child hi head wa enorm
and from it plait white hair fell down on to hi shoulder hi ey
were deep and sunken hi face wa broad and veri stern except for thi
snowwhit hair howev he did not look ancient for hi flesh wa
firm and plump and the skin on hi cheek and neck unwrinkl which
suggest to me that the stori of hi great antiqu wa fals a man
who wa over a hundr year old for instanc sure could not boast
such a beauti set of teeth for even at that distanc i could see
them gleam on the other hand evid middl ag wa far behind
him inde from hi appear it wa quit imposs to guess even
approxim the number of hi year there he sat red in the red
light perfectli still and stare without a blink of hi ey at the
furiou ball of the set sun as an eagl is said to be abl to do
saduko advanc and i walk after him my statur is not great and
i have never consid myself an impos person but somehow i do not
think that i ever felt more insignific than on thi occas the
tall and splendid nativ besid or rather behind whom i walk the
gloomi magnific of the place the bloodr light in which it wa
bath and the solemn solitari littl figur with wisdom stamp upon
it face befor me all tend to induc humil in a man not natur
vain i felt myself grow smaller and smaller both in a moral and a
physic sens i wish that my curios had not prompt me to seek
an interview with yonder uncanni be
well it wa too late to retreat inde saduko wa alreadi stand
befor the dwarf and lift hi right arm abov hi head as he gave him
the salut of makosi whereon feel that someth wa expect
of me i took off my shabbi cloth hat and bow then rememb my
white man pride replac it on my head
makosi the plural of inkoosi is the salut given
to zulu wizard becaus thei ar not on but mani sinc in
them as in the possess demoniac in the bibl dwell an
unnumb hord of spiritseditor
the wizard suddenli seem to becom awar of our presenc for ceas
hi contempl of the sink sun he scan us both with hi slow
thought ey which somehow remind me of those of a chameleon
although thei were not promin but as i have said sunken
greet son saduko he said in a deep rumbl voic why ar you
back here so soon and why do you bring thi flea of a white man with
you
now thi wa more than i could bear so without wait for my
companion answer i broke in
you give me a poor name o zikali what would you think of me if i
call you a beetl of a wizard
i should think you clever he answer after reflect for after
all i must look someth like a beetl with a white head but why
should you mind be compar to a flea a flea work by night and so
do you macumazahn a flea is activ and so ar you a flea is veri hard
to catch and kill and so ar you and lastli a flea drink it fill of
that which it desir the blood of man and beast and so you have done
do and will macumazahn and he broke into a great laugh that roll
and echo about the rocki roof abov
onc long year befor i had heard that laugh when i wa a prison
in dingaan kraal after the massacr of retief and hi compani and i
recognis it again
while i wa search for some answer in the same vein and not find
it though i thought of plenti afterward ceas of a sudden from hi
unseemli mirth he went on
do not let us wast time in jest for it is a preciou thing and
there is but littl of it left for ani on of us your busi son
saduko
baba that is the zulu for father said saduko thi white inkoosi
for as you know well enough he is a chief by natur a man of a great
heart and doubtless of high blood thi i believ is true for i have
been told that my ancestor were more or less distinguish
although if thi is so their talent did not lie in the direct of
moneymak ha offer to take me upon a shoot expedit and to
give me a good gun with two mouth in payment of my servic but i told
him i could not engag in ani fresh ventur without your leav andh
is come to see whether you will grant it my father
inde answer the dwarf nod hi great head thi clever white
man ha taken the troubl of a long walk in the sun to come here to
ask me whether he mai be allow the privileg of present you with a
weapon of great valu in return for a servic that ani man of your year
in zululand would love to give for noth in such compani
son saduko becaus my eyehol ar hollow do you think it your part
to try to fill them up with dust nai the white man ha come becaus
he desir to see him who is name openerofroad of whom he heard a
great deal when he wa but a lad and to judg whether in truth he ha
wisdom or is but a common cheat and you have come to learn whether or
no your friendship with him will be fortun whether or no he will aid
you in a certain enterpris that you have in your mind
true o zikali i said that is so far as i am concern
but saduko answer noth
well went on the dwarf sinc i am in the mood i will try to answer
both your question for i should be a poor nyanga that is doctor
if i did not when you have travel so far to ask them moreov o
macumazana be happi for i seek no fee who have made such fortun
as i need long ago befor your father wa born across the black water
macumazahn no longer work for a rewardunless it be from the hand of
on of the hous of senzangakonaand therefor as you mai guess work
but seldom
then he clap hi hand and a servant appear from somewher behind
the hut on of those fiercelook men who had stop us at the gate
he salut the dwarf and stood befor him in silenc and with bow
head
make two fire said zikali and give me my medicin
the man fetch wood which he built into two littl pile in front of
zikali these pile he fire with a brand brought from behind the hut
then he hand hi master a catskin bag
withdraw said zikali and return no more till i summon you for i am
about to prophesi if howev i should seem to die buri me tomorrow
in the place you know of and give thi white man a safeconduct from my
kraal
the man salut again and went without a word
when he had gone the dwarf drew from the bag a bundl of twist root
also some pebbl from which he select two on white and the other
black
into thi stone he said hold up the white pebbl so that the
light from the fire shone on itsinc save for the linger red
glow it wa now grow darkinto thi stone i am about to draw
your spirit o macumazana and into thi oneand he held up the black
pebbleyour o son of matiwan why do you look frighten o brave
white man who keep sai in your heart he is noth but an ugli
old kafir cheat if i am a cheat why do you look frighten is your
spirit alreadi in your throat and doe it choke you as thi littl
stone might do if you tri to swallow it and he burst into on of hi
great uncanni laugh
i tri to protest that i wa not in the least frighten but fail
for in fact i suppos my nerv were act on by hi suggest and
i did feel exactli as though that stone were in my throat onli come
upward not go downward hysteria thought i to myself the
result of be overtir and as i could not speak sat still as
though i treat hi gibe with silent contempt
now went on the dwarf perhap i shall seem to die and if so do not
touch me lest you should realli die wait till i wake up again and tell
you what your spirit have told me or if i do not wake upfor a time
must come when i shall go on sleepingwellfor as long as i have
livedaft the fire ar quit out not befor lai your hand upon
my breast and if you find me turn cold get you gone to some other
nyanga as fast as the spirit of thi place will let you o ye who would
peep into the futur
as he spoke he threw a big hand of the root that i have mention
on to each of the fire whereon tall flame leapt up from them veri
unholylook flame which were follow by column of dens white
smoke that emit a most power and choke odour quit unlik
anyth that i had ever smelt befor it seem to penetr all
through me and that accurs stone in my throat grew as larg as an
appl and felt as though someon were poke it upward with a stick
next he threw the white pebbl into the righthand fire that which wa
opposit to me sai
enter macumazahn and look and the black pebbl he threw into the
lefthand fire sai enter son of matiwan and look then come back
both of you and make report to me your master
now it is a fact that as he said these word i experienc a sensat
as though a stone had come out of my throat so readili do our nerv
deceiv us that i even thought it grate against my teeth as i open my
mouth to give it passag at ani rate the choke wa gone onli now i
felt as though i were quit empti and float on air as though i were
not i in short but a mere shell of a thing all of which doubtless wa
caus by the stench of those burn root still i could look and take
note for i distinctli saw zikali thrust hi huge head first into the
smoke of what i will call my fire next into that of saduko fire and
then lean back blow the stuff in cloud from hi mouth and nostril
afterward i saw him roll over on to hi side and lie quit still with
hi arm outstretch inde i notic that on of hi finger seem
to be in the lefthand fire and reflect that it would be burnt off in
thi howev i must have been mistaken sinc i observ subsequ
that it wa not even scorch
thu zikali lai for a long while till i began to wonder whether he were
not realli dead dead enough he seem to be for no corps could have
stai more stirless but that night i could not keep my thought
fix on zikali or anyth i mere note these circumst in a
mechan wai as might on with whom thei had noth whatsoev to
do thei did not interest me at all for there appear to be noth
in me to be interest as i gather accord to zikali becaus i wa
not there but in a warmer place than i hope ever to occupi name in
the stone in that unpleasantlook littl righthand fire
so matter went as thei might in a dream the sun had sunk complet
not even an afterglow wa left the onli light remain wa that
from the smoulder fire which just suffic to illumin the bulk of
zikali ly on hi side hi squat shape look like that of a dead
hippopotamu calf what wa left of my conscious grew heartili sick
of the whole affair i wa tire of be so empti
at length the dwarf stir he sat up yawn sneez shook himself
and began to rake among the burn ember of my fire with hi nake
hand present he found the white stone which wa now redhotat ani
rate it glow as though it wereand after examin it for a moment
final pop it into hi mouth then he hunt in the other fire for
the black stone which he treat in a similar fashion the next thing i
rememb wa that the fire which had di awai almost to noth were
burn veri brightli again i suppos becaus someon had put fuel on
them and zikali wa speak
come here o macumazana and o son of matiwan he said and i will
repeat to you what your spirit have been tell me
we drew near into the light of the fire which for some reason or other
wa extrem vivid then he spat the white stone from hi mouth into
hi big hand and i saw that now it wa cover with line and patch
like a bird egg
you cannot read the sign he said hold it toward me and when i
shook my head went on well i can as you white men read a book all
your histori is written here macumazahn but there is no need to tell
you that sinc you know it as i do well enough have learn it in
other dai the dai of dingaan macumazahn all your futur also a
veri strang futur and he scan the stone with interest ye ye
a wonder life and a nobl death far awai but of these matter you
have not ask me and therefor i mai not tell them even if i wish
nor would you believ if i did it is of your hunt trip that you have
ask me and my answer is that if you seek your own comfort you will do
well not to go a pool in a dry riverb a buffalo bull with the
tip of on horn shatter yourself and the bull in the pool saduko
yonder also in the pool and a littl halfbr man with a gun jump
about upon the bank then a litter made of bough and you in it and the
father of mameena walk lame at your side then a hut and you in it
and the maiden call mameena sit at your side
macumazahn your spirit ha written on thi stone that you should
bewar of mameena sinc she is more danger than ani buffalo if you
ar wise you will not go out hunt with umbezi although it is true
that hunt will not cost you your life there awai stone and take
your write with you and as he spoke he jerk hi arm and i heard
someth whiz past my face
next he spat out the black stone and examin it in similar fashion
your expedit will be success son of matiwan he said
togeth with macumazahn you will win mani cattl at the cost of sundri
live but for the restwel you did not ask me of it did you also
i have told you someth of that stori befor todai awai stone and
the black pebbl follow the white out into the surround gloom
we sat quit still until the dwarf broke the deep silenc with on of
hi great laugh
my witchcraft is done he said a poor tale wa it not well hunt
for those stone tomorrow and read the rest of it if you can why did
you not ask me to tell you everyth while i wa about it white man
it would have interest you more but now it ha all gone from me back
into your spirit with the stone saduko get you to sleep macumazahn
you who ar a watcherbynight come and sit with me awhil in my hut
and we will talk of other thing all thi busi of the stone is
noth more than a kafir trick is it macumazahn when you meet the
buffalo with the split horn in the pool of a dri river rememb it is
but a cheat trick and now come into my hut and drink a kamba bowl
of beer and let us talk of other thing more interest
so he took me into the hut which wa a fine on veri well light by
a fire in it centr and gave me kafir beer to drink that i swallow
gratefulli for my throat wa dry and still felt as though it had been
scrape
who ar you father i ask pointblank when i had taken my seat upon
a low stool with my back rest against the wall of the hut and lit
my pipe
he lift hi big head from the pile of kaross on which he wa ly
and peer at me across the fire

especi with chaka he whom thei name uhlanya the mad on
you see macumazahn it pleas him to laugh at me becaus
i am not as other men ar he gave me a name which mean
thethingwhichshouldneverhavebeenborn i will not speak that
name it is secret to me it mai not pass my lip yet at time he
sought my wisdom and i paid him back for hi name for i gave him veri
ill counsel and he took it and i brought him to hi death although
none ever saw my finger in that busi but when he wa dead at the
hand of hi brother dingaan and umhlangana and of umbopa umbopa who
also had a score to settl with him and hi bodi wa cast out of the
kraal like that of an evildo why i who becaus i wa a dwarf wa
not sent with the men against sotshangana went and sat on it at
night and laugh thu and he broke into on of hi hideou peal of
merriment
i laugh thrice onc for my wive whom he had taken onc for my
children whom he had slain and onc for the mock name that he had
given me then i becam the counsellor of dingaan whom i hate wors
than i had hate chaka for he wa chaka again without hi great
and you know the end of dingaan for you had a share in that war and of
umhlangana hi brother and fellowmurder whom i counsel dingaan
to slai thi i did through the lip of the old princess menkabayi
jama daughter senzangakona sister the oracl befor whom all men
bow caus her to sai that thi land of the zulu cannot be rule
by a crimson assegai for macumazahn it wa umhlangana who first
struck chaka with the spear now panda reign the last of the son of
senzangakona my enemi panda the fool and i hold my hand from panda
becaus he tri to save the life of a child of mine whom chaka slew
but panda ha son who ar as chaka wa and against them i work as i
work against those who went befor them
why i ask
why oh if i were to tell you all my stori you would understand why
macumazahn well perhap i will on dai here i mai state that as a
matter of fact he did and a veri wonder tale it is but as it ha
noth to do with thi histori i will not write it here
i dare sai i answer chaka and dingaan and umhlangana and the
other were not nice peopl but anoth question why do you tell
me all thi o zikali see that were i but to repeat it to a
talkingbird you would be smelt out and a singl moon would not die
befor you do
oh i should be smelt out and kill befor on moon di should i
then i wonder that thi ha not happen dure all the moon that ar
gone well i tell the stori to you macumazahn who have had so much to
do with the tale of the zulu sinc the dai of dingaan becaus i wish
that someon should know it and perhap write it down when everyth
is finish becaus too i have just been read your spirit and see
that it is still a white spirit and that you will not whisper it to a
talkingbird
now i leant forward and look at him
what is the end at which you aim o zikali i ask you ar not on
who beat the air with a stick on whom do you wish the stick to fall at
last
on whom he answer in a new voic a low hiss voic why on
these proud zulu thi littl famili of men who call themselv the
peopl of heaven and swallow other tribe as the great treesnak
swallow kid and small buck and when it is fat with them cri to the
world see how big i am everyth is insid of me i am a ndwand
on of those peopl whom it pleas the zulu to call amatefulapoor
hangerson who talk with an accent noth but bush swine therefor i
would see the swine tusk the hunter or if that mai not be i would
see the black hunter laid low by the rhinocero the white rhinocero
of your race macumazahn ye even if it set it foot upon the ndwand
boar as well there i have told you and thi is the reason that i live
so long for i will not die until these thing have come to pass as
come to pass thei will what did chaka senzangakona son sai when the
littl red assegai the assegai with which he slew hi mother ay and
other some of whom were near to me wa in hi liver what did he sai
to mbopa and the princ did he not sai that he heard the feet of a
great white peopl run of a peopl who should stamp the zulu flat
well i thethingwhoshouldnothavebeenborn live on until that
dai come and when it come i think that you and i macumazahn shall
not be far apart and that is why i have open out my heart to you i
who have knowledg of the futur there i speak no more of these thing
that ar to be who perchanc have alreadi said too much of them yet do
not forget my word or forget them if you will for i shall remind
you of them macumazahn when the feet of your peopl have aveng the
ndwand and other whom it pleas the zulu to treat as dirt
now thi strang man who had sat up in hi excit shook hi long
white hair which after the fashion of wizard he wore plait into
thin rope till it hung like a veil about him hide hi broad face
and deep ey present he spoke again through thi veil of hair
sai
you ar wonder macumazahn what saduko ha to do with all these
great event that ar to be i answer that he must plai hi part in
them not a veri great part but still a part and it is for thi
purpos that i save him as a child from bangu dingaan man and
rear him up to be a warrior although sinc i cannot lie i warn
him that he would do well to leav spear alon and follow after wisdom
well he will slai bangu who now ha quarrel with panda and a woman
will come into the stori on mameena and that woman will bring about
war between the son of panda and from thi war shall spring the ruin
of the zulu for he who win will be an evil king to them and
bring down on them the wrath of a mightier race and so
thethingthatshouldnothavebeenborn and the ndwand and the
quabi and twetwa whom it ha pleas the conquer zulu to name
amatefula shall be aveng ye ye my spirit tell me all these
thing and thei ar true
and what of saduko my friend and your fosterl
saduko your friend and my fosterl will take hi appoint road
macumazahn as i shall and you will what more could he desir see
it is that which he ha chosen he will take hi road and he will plai
the part which the greatgreat ha prepar for him seek not to know
more why should you sinc time will tell you the stori and now go to
rest macumazahn as i must who am old and feebl and when it pleas
you to visit me again we will talk further meanwhil rememb alwai
that i am noth but an old kafir cheat who pretend to a knowledg
that belong to no man rememb it especi macumazahn when you
meet a buffalo with a split horn in the pool of a driedup river and
afterward when a woman name mameena make a certain offer to you
which you mai be tempt to accept good night to you watcherbynight
with the white heart and the strang destini good night to you and try
not to think too hardli of the old kafir cheat who just now is call
openerofroad my servant wait without to lead you to your hut
and if you wish to be back at umbezi kraal by nightfal tomorrow
you will do well to start er sunris sinc as you found in come
saduko although he mai be a fool is a veri good walker and you do not
like to be left behind macumazahn do you
so i rose to go but as i went some impuls seem to take him and he
call me back and made me sit down again
macumazahn he said i would add a word when you were quit a lad
you came into thi countri with retief did you not
ye i answer slowli for thi matter of the massacr of retief is
on of which i have seldom care to speak for sundri reason although
i have made a record of it in write even my friend sir henri
curti and captain good have heard littl of the part i plai in that
tragedi but what do you know of that busi zikali
publish under the titl of marieeditor
all that there is to know i think macumazahn see that i wa at
the bottom of it and that dingaan kill those boer on my advicejust
as he kill chaka and umhlangana
you coldblood old murder i began but he interrupt me at
onc
why do you throw evil name at me macumazahn as i threw the stone of
your fate at you just now why am i a murder becaus i brought about
the death of some white men that chanc to be your friend who had
come here to cheat us black folk of our countri
wa it for thi reason that you brought about their death zikali
i ask stare him in the face for i felt that he wa ly to me
not altogeth macumazahn he answer let hi ey those
strang ey that could look at the sun without blink fall befor
my gaze have i not told you that i hate the hous of senzangakona
and when retief and hi companion were kill did not the spill of
their blood mean war to the end between the zulu and the white men did
it not mean the death of dingaan and of thousand of hi peopl which
is but a begin of death now do you understand
i understand that you ar a veri wick man i answer with
indign
at least you should not sai so macumazahn he repli in a new
voic on with the ring of truth in it
why not
becaus i save your life on that dai you escap alon of the white
men did you not and you never could understand why could you
no i could not zikali i put it down to what you would call the
spirit
well i will tell you those spirit of your wore my kaross and
he laugh i saw you with the boer and saw too that you were of
anoth peopleth peopl of the english you mai have heard at the
time that i wa doctor at the great place although i kept out of the
wai and we did not meet or at least you never knew that we met for you
wereasleep also i piti your youth for although you do not believ
it i had a littl bit of heart left in those dai also i knew that we
should come togeth again in the after year as you see we have done
todai and shall often do until the end so i told dingaan that whoever
di you must be spare or he would bring up the peopl of georg
ie the english to aveng you and your ghost would enter into him
and pour out a curs upon him he believ me who did not understand
that alreadi so mani curs were gather about hi head that on more
or less made no matter so you see you were spare macumazahn and
afterward you help to pour out a curs upon dingaan without becom
a ghost which is the reason why panda like you so well todai panda
the enemi of dingaan hi brother you rememb the woman who help
you well i made her do so how did it go with you afterward
macumazahn with you and the boer maiden across the buffalo river to
whom you were make love in those dai
never mind how it went i repli spring up for the old wizard
talk had stir sad and bitter memori in my heart that time is
dead zikali
is it macumazahn now from the look upon your face i should have said
that it wa still veri much aliv as thing that happen in our youth
have a wai of keep aliv but doubtless i am mistaken and it is all
as dead as dingaan and as retief and as the other your companion
at least although you do not believ it i save your life on that
red dai for my own purpos of cours not becaus on white life wa
anyth among so mani in my count and now go to rest macumazahn
go to rest for although your heart ha been awaken by memori thi
even i promis that you shall sleep well tonight and throw the
long hair back off hi ey he look at me keenli wag hi big head
to and fro and burst into anoth of hi great laugh
so i went but ah as i went i wept
anyon who knew all that stori would understand why but thi is not the
place to tell it that tale of my first love and of the terribl event
which befel us in the time of dingaan still as i sai i have written
it down and perhap on dai it will be read
chapter iii the buffalo with the cleft horn
i slept veri well that night i suppos becaus i wa so dogtir
i could not help it but next dai on our long walk back to umbezi
kraal i thought a great deal
without doubt i had seen and heard veri strang thing both of the
past and the presentth that i could not in the least understand
moreov thei were mix up with all sort of question of high zulu
polici and threw a new light upon event that happen to me and other
in my youth
now in the clear sunlight wa the time to analys these thing and
thi i did in the most logic fashion i could command although without
the slightest assist from saduko who when i ask him question
mere shrug hi shoulder
these question he said did not interest him i had wish to see the
magic of zikali and zikali had been pleas to show me some veri good
magic quit of hi best inde also he had convers alon with me
afterward doubtless on high mattersso high that he saduko wa not
admit to share the conversationwhich wa an honour he accord
to veri few i could form my own conclus in the light of the white
man wisdom which everyon knew wa great
i repli shortli that i could for saduko tone irrit me of
cours the truth wa that he felt aggriev at be sent off to
bed like a littl boi while hi fosterfath the old dwarf made
confid to me on of saduko fault wa that he had alwai a veri
good opinion of himself also he wa by natur terribl jealou even in
littl thing as the reader of hi histori if ani will learn
we trudg on for sever hour in silenc broken at length by my
companion
do you still mean to go on a shoot expedit with umbezi inkoosi
he ask or ar you afraid
of what should i be afraid i answer tartli
of the buffalo with the split horn of which zikali told you what
els
now i fear i us strong languag about the buffalo with the split
horn a beast in which i declar i had no belief whatsoev either
with or without it accessori of dri riverb and waterhol
if all thi old woman talk ha made you afraid howev i ad
you can stop at the kraal with mameena
why should the talk make me afraid macumazahn zikali did not sai that
thi evil spirit of a buffalo would hurt me if i fear it is for you
see that if you ar hurt you mai not be abl to go with me to look
for bangu cattl
oh i repli sarcast it seem that you ar somewhat selfish
friend saduko sinc it is of your welfar and not of my safeti that you
ar think
if i were as selfish as you seem to believ inkoosi should i advis
you to stop with your wagon and therebi lose the good gun with two
mouth that you have promis me still it is true that i should like
well enough to stai at umbezi kraal with mameena especi if umbezi
were awai
now as there is noth more uninterest than to listen to
other peopl love affair and as i saw that with the slightest
encourag saduko wa readi to tell me all the histori of hi
courtship over again i did not continu the argument so we finish
our journei in silenc and arriv at umbezi kraal a littl after
sundown to find to the disappoint of both of us that mameena wa
still awai
upon the follow morn we start on our shoot expedit the
parti consist of myself my servant scowl who as i think i said
hail from the cape and wa half a hottentot saduko the merri old
zulu umbezi and a number of hi men to serv as bearer and beater
it prove a veri success tripthat is until the end of itfor in
those dai the game in thi part of the countri wa extrem plenti
befor the end of the second week i kill four eleph two of them
with larg tusk while saduko who soon develop into a veri fair
shot bag anoth with the doublebarrel gun that i had promis
him also umbezihow i have never discov for the thing partook
of the natur of a miraclemanag to slai an eleph cow with fair
ivori us the old rifl that went off at halfcock
never have i seen a man black or white so delight as wa that
vainglori kafir for whole hour he danc and sang and took snuff
and salut with hi hand tell me the stori of hi deed over and
over again no singl version of which tale agre with the other he
took a new titl also that meant eaterupofeleph he allow
on of hi men to bongathat is praisehim all through the night
prevent us from get a wink of sleep until at last the poor
fellow drop in a kind of fit from exhaust and so forth it realli
wa veri amus until it becam a bore
besid the eleph we kill lot of other thing includ two
lion which i got almost with a right and left and three white
rhinoceros that now ala ar nearli extinct at last toward the
end of the third week we had as much as our men could carri in the
shape of ivori rhinocero horn skin and sundri buckflesh or
biltong and determin to start back for umbezi kraal next dai
inde thi could not be long delai as our powder and lead were
run low for in those dai it will be rememb breechload had
not come in and ammunit therefor had to be carri in bulk
to tell the truth i wa veri glad that our trip had come to such a
satisfactori conclus for although i would not admit it even to
myself i could not get rid of a kind of sneak dread lest after
all there might be someth in the old dwarf propheci about a
disagre adventur with a buffalo which wa in store for me well
as it chanc we had not so much as seen a buffalo and as the road
which we were go to take back to the kraal ran over high bare
countri that these anim did not frequent there wa now littl
prospect of our do soall of which of cours show what i alreadi
knew that onli weakhead superstiti idiot would put the slightest
faith in the drivel nonsens of deceiv or selfdeceiv kafir
medicinemen these thing inde i point out with much vigour to
saduko befor we turn in on the last night of the hunt
saduko listen in silenc and said noth at all except that he would
not keep me up ani longer as i must be tire
now whatev mai be the reason for it my experi in life is that it
is never wise to brag about anyth at ani rate on a hunt trip to
come to a particular instanc wait until you ar safe at home till you
begin to do so of the truth of thi ancient adag i wa now destin to
experi a particularli fine and concret exampl
the place where we had camp wa in scatter bush overlook a great
extent of dry reed that in the wet season wa doubtless a swamp fed by
a small river which ran into it on the side opposit to our camp dure
the night i woke up think that i heard some big beast move in
these reed but as no further sound reach my ear i went to sleep
again
shortli after dawn i wa awaken by a voic call me which in a hazi
fashion i recognis as that of umbezi
macumazahn said the voic in a hoars whisper the reed below us
ar full of buffalo get up get up at onc
what for i answer if the buffalo came into the reed thei will go
out of them we do not want meat
no macumazahn but i want their hide panda the king ha demand
fifti shield of me and without kill oxen that i can ill spare i
have not the skin whereof to make them now these buffalo ar in a
trap thi swamp is like a dish with on mouth thei cannot get out
at the side of the dish and the mouth by which thei came in is veri
narrow if we station ourselv at either side of it we can kill mani of
them
by thi time i wa thoroughli awak and had arisen from my blanket
throw a kaross over my shoulder i left the hut made of bough
in which i wa sleep and walk a few pace to the crest of a rocki
ridg whenc i could see the dry vlei below here the mist of dawn
still clung but from it rose sound of grunt bellow and trampl
which i an old hunter could not mistak evid a herd of buffalo
on or two hundr of them had establish themselv in those reed
just then my bastard servant scowl and saduko join us both of them
full of excit
it appear that scowl who never seem to sleep at ani natur time
had seen the buffalo enter the reed and estim their number at
two or three hundr saduko had examin the cleft through which thei
pass and report it to be so narrow that we could kill ani number of
them as thei rush out to escap
quit so i understand i said well my opinion is that we had
better let them escap onli four of us count umbezi ar arm with
gun and assegai ar not of much us against buffalo let them go i
sai
umbezi think of a cheap raw materi for the shield which had been
requisit by the king who would sure be pleas if thei were made
of such a rare and tough hide as that of buffalo protest
violent and saduko either to pleas on whom he hope might be hi
fatherinlaw or from sheer love of sport for which he alwai had a
posit passion back him up onli scowlwhos dash of hottentot
blood made him cun and cautioustook my side point out that we
were veri short of powder and that buffalo at up much lead at last
saduko said
the lord macumazana is our captain we must obei him although it is a
piti but doubtless the prophesi of zikali weigh upon hi mind so
there is noth to be done
zikali exclaim umbezi what ha the old dwarf to do with thi
matter
never mind what he ha or ha not to do with it i broke in for
although i do not think that he meant them as a taunt but mere as a
statement of fact saduko word stung me to the quick especi as
my conscienc told me that thei were not altogeth without foundat
we will try to kill some of these buffalo i went on although
unless the herd should get bog which is not like as the swamp is
veri dry i do not think that we can hope for more than eight or ten at
the most which wont be of much us for shield come let us make a
plan we have no time to lose for i think thei will begin to move again
befor the sun is well up
half an hour later the four of us who were arm with gun were post
behind rock on either side of the steep natur roadwai cut by water
which led down to the vlei and with us some of umbezi men that chief
himself wa at my sidea post of honour which he had insist upon
take to tell the truth i did not dissuad him for i thought that
i should be safer so than if he were opposit to me sinc even if the
old rifl did not go off of it own accord umbezi when excit wa a
most uncertain shot the herd of buffalo appear to have lain down in
the reed so be care to post ourselv first we sent three of
the nativ bearer to the farther side of the vlei with instruct to
rous the beast by shout the remaind of the zulusther were ten
or a dozen of them arm with stab spearsw kept with us
but what did these scoundrel do instead of disturb the herd
by make a nois as we told them for some reason best known to
themselvesi expect it wa becaus thei were afraid to go into the
vlei where thei might meet the horn of a buffalo at ani momentthei
fire the dry reed in three or four place at onc and thi if you
pleas with a strong wind blow from them to us in a minut or two
the farther side of the swamp wa a sheet of crackl flame that gave
off cloud of dens white smoke then pandemonium began
the sleep buffalo leapt to their feet and after a few moment of
indecis crash toward us the whole huge herd of them snort
and bellow like mad thing see what wa about to happen i nip
behind a big boulder while scowl shin up a mimosa with the swift
of a cat and heedless of it thorn sat himself in an eagl nest
at the top the zulu with the spear bolt to take cover where thei
could what becam of saduko i did not see but old umbezi bewild
with excit jump into the exact middl of the roadwai shout
thei come thei come charg buffalo folk if you will the
eaterupofeleph await you
you etceterad old fool i shout but got no farther for just at
thi moment the first of the buffalo which i could see wa an enorm
bull probabl the leader of the herd accept umbezi invit and
came with it nose stuck straight out in front of it umbezi gun went
off and next instant he went up through the smoke i saw hi black bulk
in the air and then heard it alight with a thud on the top of the rock
behind which i wa crouch
exit umbezi i said to myself and by wai of a requiem let the bull
which had hoist him as i thought to heaven have an ounc of lead
in the rib as it pass me after that i did not fire ani more for it
occur to me that it wa as well not to further advertis my presenc
in all my hunt experi i cannot rememb ever see such a sight
as that which follow out of the vlei rush the buffalo by dozen
everi on of them make remark in it own languag as it came thei
jam in the narrow roadwai thei leapt on to each other back thei
squeal thei kick thei bellow thei charg my friendli rock till
i felt it shake thei knock over scowl mimosa thorn and would have
shot him out of hi eagl nest had not it flat top fortun caught
in that of anoth and less access tree and with them came cloud
of pungent smoke mix with bit of burn reed and puff of hot air
it wa over at last with the except of some calv which had been
trampl to death in the rush the herd had gone now like the roman
emperori think he wa an emperori began to wonder what had becom of
my legion
umbezi i shout or rather sneez through the smoke ar you
dead umbezi
ye ye macumazahn repli a choke and melancholi voic from the
top of the rock i am dead quit dead that evil spirit of a silwana
ie wild beast ha kill me oh why did i think i wa a hunter why
did i not stop at my kraal and count my cattl
i am sure i dont know you old lunat i answer as i scrambl up
the rock to bid him goodby
it wa a rock with a razor top like the ridg of a hous and
there hang across thi ridg like a pair of nether garment on a
clotheslin i found the eaterupofeleph
where did he get you umbezi i ask for i could not see hi wound
becaus of the smoke
behind macumazahn behind he groan for i had turn to fly but
ala too late
on the contrari i repli for on so heavi you flew veri well like
a bird umbezi like a bird
look and see what the evil beast ha done to me macumazahn it will be
easi for my moocha ha gone
so i look examin umbezi ampl proport with care but could
discov noth except a larg smudg of black mud as though he had
sat down in a halfdri puddl then i guess the truth the buffalo
horn had miss him he had been struck onli with it muddi nose
which be almost as broad as that portion of umbezi with which it
came in contact had inflict noth wors than a bruis when i wa
sure he had receiv no seriou injuri my temper alreadi sore tri
gave out and i administ to him the soundest smackinghi posit
be veri convenientthat he had ever receiv sinc he wa a littl
boi
get up you idiot i shout and let us look for the other thi
is the end of your folli in make me attack a herd of buffalo in reed
get up am i to stop here till i choke
do you mean to tell me that i have no mortal wound macumazahn he
ask with a return of cheer accept the castig in good
part for he wa not on who bore malic oh i am glad to hear it for
now i shall live to make those coward who fire the reed sorri that
thei ar not dead also to finish off that wild beast for i hit him
macumazahn i hit him
i dont know whether you hit him i know he hit you i repli as i
shove him off the rock and ran toward the tilt tree where i had last
seen scowl
here i beheld anoth strang sight scowl wa still seat in the
eagl nest that he share with two nearli fledg young bird on of
which have been injur wa utter piteou cri nor did it cry
in vain for it parent which were of that great varieti of kite that
the boer call lammefang or lamblift had just arriv to it
assist and were give their new nestl scowl the best do
that man ever receiv at the beak and claw of feather kind seen
through those rush smoke wreath the combat look perfectli
titan also it wa on of the noisiest to which i ever listen for
i dont know which shriek the more loudli the infuri eagl or
their victim
see how thing stood i burst into a roar of laughter and just then
scowl grab the leg of the male bird that wa plant in hi breast
while it remov tuft of hi wool with it hook beak and leapt
boldli from the nest which had becom too hot to hold him the eagl
outspread wing broke hi fall for thei act as a parachut and so
did umbezi upon whom he chanc to land spring from the prostrat
shape of the chief who now had a bruis in front to match that behind
scowl cover with peck and scratch ran like a lamplight
leav me to collect my second gun which he had drop at the bottom
of the tree but fortun without injur it the kafir
gave him anoth name after that encount which meant
hewhofightsbirdsandgetstheworstofit
well we escap from the line of the smoke a dishevel trioinde
umbezi had noth left on him except hi head ringand shout for the
other if perchanc thei had not been trodden to death in the rush the
first to arriv wa saduko who look quit calm and untroubl but
stare at us in astonish and ask coolli what we had been do
to get in such a state i repli in appropri languag and ask in
turn how he had manag to remain so nice dress
he did not answer but i believ the truth wa that he had crept into
a larg antbear holesmal blame to him to be frank then the
remaind of our parti turn up on by on some of them look veri
blown as though thei had run a long wai none were miss except
those who had fire the reed and thei thought it well to keep clear
for a good mani hour i believ that afterward thei regret not
have taken a longer leav of absenc but when thei final did
arriv i wa in no condit to note what pass between them and their

as possibl but i had reckon without the vaniti of umbezi umbezi
stretch over the edg of a sharp rock whither he had been hoist by
the nose of a buffalo and imagin himself to be mortal wound

hi bruis he support hi person with on hand in front and with the
other behind know hi injuri to be pure superfici wa quit
anoth

matter of fact it wa i allan quatermain who had wound it i would
make it bite the dust for it cannot be far awai let us follow it
he glare round him whereon hi obsequi peopl or on of them
echo
ye by all mean let us follow it eaterupofeleph
macumazahn the clever white man will show us how for where is the
buffalo that he fear
of cours after thi there wa noth els to be done so have
summon the scratch scowl who seem to have no heart in the
busi we start on the spoor of the herd which wa as easi to
track as a wagon road
never mind baa said scowl thei ar two hour march off by now
i hope so i answer but as it happen luck wa against me for
befor we had cover half a mile some overzeal fellow struck a
blood spoor
i march on that spoor for twenti minut or so till we came to a
patch of bush that slope downward to a riverb right to thi river
i follow it till i reach the edg of a big pool that wa still full
of water although the river itself had gone dry here i stood look
at the spoor and consult with saduko as to whether the beast could
have swum the pool for the track that went to it veri verg had
becom confus and uncertain suddenli our doubt were end sinc
out of a patch of dens bush which we had passedfor it had plai the
common trick of doubl back on it own spoorappear the buffalo a
huge bull that halt on three leg my bullet have broken on of it
thigh as to it ident there wa no doubt sinc on or rather from
it right horn which wa cleft apart at the top hung the remain of
umbezi moocha
oh bewar inkoosi cri saduko in a frighten voic it is the
buffalo with the cleft horn
i heard him i saw all the scene in the hut of zikali rose befor
meth old dwarf hi word everyth i lift my rifl and fire at
the charg beast but knew that the bullet glanc from it skull i
threw down the gunfor the buffalo wa right on meand tri to jump
asid
almost i did so but that cleft horn to which hung the remain
of umbezi moocha scoop me up and hurl me off the river bank
backward and sidewai into the deep pool below as i depart thither i
saw saduko spring forward and heard a shot fire that caus the bull to
collaps for a moment then with a slow slide motion it follow me
into the pool
now we were togeth and there wa no room for both so after a certain
amount of dodg i went under as the lighter dog alwai doe in a
fight that buffalo seem to do everyth to me which a buffalo
could do under the circumst it tri to horn me and partial
succeed although i duck at each swoop then it struck me with it
nose and drove me to the bottom of the pool although i got hold of it
lip and twist it then it calmli knelt on me and sank me deeper and
deeper into the mud i rememb kick it in the stomach after thi i
rememb no more except a kind of wild dream in which i rehears
all the scene in the dwarf hut and hi request that when i met the
buffalo with the cleft horn in the pool of a dri river i should
rememb that he wa noth but a poor old kafir cheat
after thi i saw my mother bend over a littl child in my bed in the
old hous in oxfordshir where i wa born and thenblack
i came to myself again and saw instead of my mother the state figur
of saduko bend over me upon on side and on the other that of scowl
the halfbr hottentot who wa weep for hi hot tear fell upon my
face
he is gone said poor scowl that bewitch beast with the split
horn ha kill him he is gone who wa the best white man in all south
africa whom i love better than my father and all my rel
that you might easili do bastard answer saduko see that you
do not know who thei ar but he is not gone for the openerofroad
said that he would live also i got my spear into the heart of that
buffalo befor he had knead the life out of him as fortun the
mud wa soft yet i fear that hi rib ar broken and he poke me with
hi finger on the breast
take your clumsi hand off me i gasp
there said saduko i have made him feel did i not tell you that he
would live
after thi i rememb littl more except some confus dream till i
found myself ly in a great hut which i discov subsequ wa
umbezi own the same inde wherein i had doctor the ear of that
wife of hi who wa call wornoutoldcow
chapter iv mameena
for a while i contempl the roof and side of the hut by the light
which enter it through the smokev and the doorhol wonder
whose it might be and how i came there
then i tri to sit up and instantli wa seiz with agoni in the
region of the rib which i found were bound about with broad strip of
soft tan hide clearli thei or some of them were broken
what had broken them i ask myself and in a flash everyth
came back to me so i had escap with my life as the old dwarf
openerofroad had told me that i should certainli he wa an
excel prophet and if he spoke truth in thi matter why not in
other what wa i to make of it all how could a black savag howev
ancient forese the futur
by induct from the past i suppos and yet what amount of induct
would suffic to show him the detail of a forthcom accid that
wa to happen to me through the agenc of a wild beast with a peculiarli
shape horn i gave it up as befor and sinc that dai i have found it
necessari to do in the case of mani other event in life inde
the question is on that i often have had caus to ask where kafir
witchdoctor or prophet ar concern notabl in the instanc of a
certain mavovo of whom i hope to tell on dai whose predict save
my life and those of my companion
just then i heard the sound of someon creep through the beehol
of the hut and halfclos my ey as i did not feel inclin for
convers the person came and stood over me and somehowbi
instinct i supposei becam awar that my visitor wa a woman veri
slowli i lift my eyelid just enough to enabl me to see her
there stand in a beam of golden light that pass through the
smokehol pierc the soft gloom of the hut stood the most beauti
creatur that i had ever seenthat is if it be admit that a person
who is black or rather coppercolour can be beauti
she wa a littl abov the medium height not more with a figur that
so far as i am a judg of such matter wa absolut perfectthat of
a greek statu inde on thi point i had an opportun of form an
opinion sinc except for her littl bead apron and a singl string
of larg blue bead about her throat her costum waswel that of
a greek statu her featur show no trace of the negro type on the
contrari thei were singularli well cut the nose be straight and
fine and the pout mouth that just show the ivori teeth between
veri small then the ey larg dark and liquid like those of a
buck set beneath a smooth broad forehead on which the curl but not
woolli hair grew low thi hair by the wai wa not dress up in ani
of the eccentr nativ fashion but simpli part in the middl and
ti in a big knot over the nape of the neck the littl ear peep
out through it tress the hand like the feet were veri small and
delic and the curv of the bust soft and full without be coars
or even show the promis of coars
a love woman truli and yet there wa someth not quit pleas
about that beauti face someth notwithstand it childlik
outlin which remind me of a flower break into bloom that on
doe not associ with youth and innoc i tri to analys what
thi might be and came to the conclus that without be hard it
wa too clever and in a sens too reflect i felt even then that
the brain within the shape head wa keen and bright as polish steel
that thi woman wa on made to rule not to be man toi or even hi
love companion but to us him for her end
she drop her chin till it hid the littl dimplelik depress
below her throat which wa on of her charm and began not to look at
but to studi me see which i shut my ey tight and wait evid
she thought that i wa still in my swoon for now she spoke to herself
in a low voic that wa soft and sweet as honei
a small man she said saduko would make two of him and the
otherwho wa he i wonderedthre hi hair too is ugli he cut
it short and it stick up like that on a cat back iya ie
piff and she move her hand contemptu a feather of a man but
whitewhit on of those who rule why thei all of them know that he
is their master thei call him hewhoneversleep thei sai that he
ha the courag of a lioness with youngh who got awai when dingaan
kill piti retief and the boer thei sai that he is quick and
cun as a snake and that panda and hi great induna think more of
him than of ani white man thei know he is unmarri also though thei
sai too that twice he had a wife who di and now he doe not turn
to look at women which is strang in ani man and show that he will
escap troubl and succe still it must be rememb that thei ar
all ugli down here in zululand cow or heifer who will be cow piff
no more
she paus for a littl while then went on in her dreami reflect
voic
now if he met a woman who is not mere a cow or a heifer a woman
clever than himself even if she were not white i wonder
at thi point i thought it well to wake up turn my head i yawn
open my ey and look at her vagu see which her express
chang in a flash from that of brood power to on of move and
anxiou girlhood in short it becam most sweetli feminin

oldest mother
do you mean her whom your father call the wornoutoldcow and
whose ear he shot off
ye it must be she from the descript she answer with a littl
shake of laughter though i never heard him give her that name
or if you did you have forgotten it i said dryli well i think
not thank you why troubl her when you will do quit as well if
there is milk in that gourd perhap you will give me a drink of it
she flew to the bowl like a swallow and next moment wa kneel at my
side and hold it to my lip with on hand while with the other she
support my head
i am honour she said i onli came to the hut the moment befor
you woke and see you still lost in swoon i weptlook my ey ar

fear lest that sleep should be but the begin of the last
quit so i said it is veri good of you and now sinc your fear
ar groundlessthank be to the heavenssit down if you will and
tell me the stori of how i came here
she sat down not i note as a kafir woman ordinarili doe in a kind
of kneel posit but on a stool
you were carri into the kraal inkoosi she said on a litter of
bough my heart stood still when i saw that litter come it wa no
more heart it wa cold iron becaus i thought the dead or injur man
wa and she paus
saduko i suggest

evil brute of a buffalo had nearli kill you in the pool that is all
ye ye mameena but how did i get out of the pool
oh it seem that your servant sikauli the bastard leapt into the
water and engag the attent of the buffalo which wa knead you
into the mud while saduko got on to it back and drove hi assegai down
between it shoulder to the heart so that it di then thei pull
you out of the mud crush and almost drown with water and brought
you to life again but afterward you becam senseless and so lai
wander in your speech until thi hour
ah he is a brave man is saduko
like other neither more nor less she repli with a shrug of her
round shoulder would you have had him let you die i think the
brave man wa he who got in front of the bull and twist it nose not
he who sat on it back and poke at it with a spear
at thi period in our convers i becam suddenli faint and lost
count of thing even of the interest mameena when i awok again she
wa gone and in her place wa old umbezi who i notic took down
a mat from the side of the hut and fold it up to serv as a cushion
befor he sat himself upon the stool
greet macumazahn he said when he saw that i wa awak how ar
you
as well as can be hope i answer and how ar you umbezi
oh bad macumazahn even now i can scarc sit down for that bull
had a veri hard nose also i am swollen up in front where sikauli struck
me when he tumbl out of the tree also my heart is cut in two becaus
of our loss
what loss umbezi
wow macumazahn the fire that those low fellow of mine lit got to our
camp and burn up nearli everythingth meat the skin and even the
ivori which it crack so that it is useless that wa an unlucki hunt
for although it began so well we have come out of it quit nake ye
with noth at all except the head of the bull with the cleft horn
that i thought you might like to keep
well umbezi let us be thank that we have come out with our
livesthat is if i am go to live i ad
oh macumazahn you will live without doubt and be none the wors two
of our doctorsveri clever menhav look at you and said so on of
them ti you up in all those skin and i promis him a heifer for the
busi if he cure you and gave him a goat on account but you must
lie here for a month or more so he sai meanwhil panda ha sent for
the hide which he demand of me to be made into shield and i have
been oblig to kill twentyf of my beast to provid themthat is
of my own and of those of my headmen
then i wish you and your headmen had kill them befor we met those
buffalo umbezi i groan for my rib were pain me veri much
send saduko and sikauli here i would thank them for save my life
so thei came next morn i think and i thank them warmli enough
there there baa said scowl who wa liter weep tear of joi
at my return from delirium and coma to the light of life and reason not
tear of mameena sort but real on for i saw them run down hi
snub nose that still bore mark of the eagl claw there there
sai no more i beseech you if you were go to die i wish to die
too who if you had left it should onli have wander through the
world without a heart that is why i jump into the pool not becaus i
am brave
when i heard thi my own ey grew moist oh it is the fashion to abus
nativ but from whom do we meet with more fidel and love than from
these poor wild kafir that so mani of us talk of as black dirt which
chanc to be fashion to the shape of man
as for myself inkoosi ad saduko i onli did my duti how could
i have held up my head again if the bull had kill you while i walk
awai aliv why the veri girl would have mock at me but oh hi
skin wa tough i thought that assegai would never get through it
observ the differ between these two men charact the on
although no hero in daili life imperil himself from sheer doglik
fidel to a master who had given him mani hard word and sometim
a flog in punish for drunken and the other to gratifi hi
pride also perhap becaus my death would have interf with hi
plan and ambit in which i had a part to plai no that is a hard
sai still there is no doubt that saduko alwai first took hi own
interest into consider and how what he did would reflect upon
hi prospect and reput or influenc the attain of hi desir i
think thi wa so even when mameena wa concernedat ani rate in the
beginningalthough certainli he alwai love her with a singleheart
passion that is veri rare among zulu
present scowl left the hut to prepar me some broth whereon saduko at
onc turn the talk to thi subject of mameena
he understood that i had seen her did i not think her veri beauti
ye veri beauti i answer inde the most beauti zulu
woman i have ever seen
and veri cleveralmost as clever as a white
ye and veri clevermuch clever than most white
andanyth els
ye veri danger and on who could turn like the wind and blow hot
and blow cold
ah he said thought a while then ad well what do i care how
she blow to other so long as she blow hot to me
well saduko and doe she blow hot for you
not altogeth macumazahn anoth paus i think she blow rather
like the wind befor a great storm
that is a bite wind saduko and when we feel it we know that the
storm will follow
i dare sai that the storm will follow inkoosi for she wa born in a
storm and storm goe with her but what of that if she and i stand it
out togeth i love her and i had rather die with her than live with
ani other woman
the question is saduko whether she would rather die with you than
live with ani other man doe she sai so
inkoosi mameena thought work in the dark it is like a white ant in
it tunnel of mud you see the tunnel which show that she is think
but you do not see the thought within still sometim when she
believ that no on behold or hear herher i bethought me of the
young ladi soliloqui over my appar senseless selfor when she
is surpris the true thought peep out of it tunnel it did so the
other dai when i plead with her after she had heard that i kill the
buffalo with the cleft horn
do i love you she said i know not for sure how can i tell it is
not our custom that a maiden should love befor she is marri for
if she did so most marriag would be thing of the heart and not of
cattl and then half the father of zululand would grow poor and refus
to rear girlchildren who would bring them noth you ar brave you
ar handsom you ar wellborn i would sooner live with you than
with ani other man i knowthat is if you were rich and better still
power becom rich and power saduko and i think that i shall
love you
i will mameena i answer but you must wait the zulu nation wa
not fashion from noth in a dai first chaka had to come
ah she said and my father her ey flash ah chaka there wa
a man be anoth chaka saduko and i will love you moremor than you
can dream ofthu and thu and she flung her arm about me and kiss
me as i wa never kiss befor which as you know among us is a
strang thing for a girl to do then she thrust me from her with a
laugh and ad as for the wait you must ask my father of that
am i not hi heifer to be sold and can i disobei my father and she
wa gone leav me empti for it seem as though she took my vital
with her nor will she talk thu ani more the white ant who ha gone
back into it tunnel
and did you speak to her father
ye i spoke to him but in an evil moment for he had but just kill
the cattl to furnish panda shield he answer me veri roughli he
said you see these dead beast which i and my peopl must slai for
the king or fall under hi displeasur well bring me five time their
number and we will talk of your marriag with my daughter who is a
maid in some request
i answer that i understood and would try my best whereon he becam
more gentl for umbezi ha a kindli heart
my son he said i like you well and sinc i saw you save
macumazahn my friend from that mad wild beast of a buffalo i like
you better than befor yet you know my case i have an old name and
am call the chief of a tribe and mani live on me but i am poor and
thi daughter of mine is worth much such a woman few men have bred
well i must make the best of her my soninlaw must be on who will
prop up my old ag on to whom in my need or troubl i could alwai
go as to a dry log to break off some of it bark to make a fire to
comfort me not on who tread me into the mire as the buffalo did to
macumazahn now i have spoken and i do not love such talk come back
with the cattl and i will listen to you but meanwhil understand that
i am not bound to you or to anyon i shall take what my spirit send
me which if i mai judg the futur by the past will not be much on
word more do not linger about thi kraal too long lest it should be
said that you ar the accept suitor of mameena go henc and do a
man work and return with a man reward or not at all
in zululand a soninlaw is known as isigodo so
mkwenyana the soninlaw log for the reason state in
the texteditor
well saduko that spear ha an edg on it ha it not i answer
and now what is your plan
my plan is macumazahn he said rise from hi seat to go henc
and gather those who ar friendli to me becaus i am my father son
and still the chief of the amangwan or those who ar left of them
although i have no kraal and no hoof of kine then within a moon i
hope i shall return here to find you strong again and onc more a man
and we will start out against bangu as i have whisper to you with
the leav of a high on who ha said that if i can take ani cattl i
mai keep them for my pain
i dont know about that saduko i never promis you that i would make
war upon banguwith or without the king leav
no you never promis but zikali the dwarf the wise littl on said
that you wouldand doe zikali lie ask yourself who will rememb a
certain sai of hi about a buffalo with a cleft horn a pool and a
dry riverb farewel o my father macumazahn i walk with the dawn
and i leav mameena in your keep
you mean that you leav me in mameena keep i began but alreadi
he wa crawl through the hole in the hut
well mameena kept me veri comfort she wa alwai in evid yet
not too much so
heedless of her malic and abus she head off the wornoutoldcow
whom she knew i detest from my presenc she saw person to my
bandag as well as to the cook of my food over which matter she
had sever quarrel with the bastard scowl who did not like her
for on him she never wast ani of her sweet look also as i grew
stronger she sat with me a good deal talk sinc by common
consent mameena the fair wa exempt from all the field and even
the ordinari household labour that fall to the lot of kafir women her
place wa to be the ornament and i mai add the advertis of her
father kraal other might do the work and she saw that thei did it
we discuss all sort of thing from the christian and other religion
and european polici down for her thirst for knowledg seem to be
insati but what realli interest her wa the state of affair in
zululand with which she knew i wa well acquaint as a person who
had plai a part in it histori and who wa receiv and trust at the
great hous and as a white man who understood the design and plan of
the boer and of the governor of natal
now if the old king panda should chanc to die she would ask me
which of hi son did i think would succe himumbelazi or cetewayo
or anoth or if he did not chanc to die which of them would he name
hi heir
i repli that i wa not a prophet and that she had better ask zikali
the wise
that is a veri good idea she said onli i have no on to take me to
him sinc my father would not allow me to go with saduko hi ward
then she clap her hand and ad oh macumazahn will you take me
my father would trust me with you
ye i dare sai i answer but the question is could i trust
myself with you
what do you mean she ask oh i understand then after all i am
more to you than a black stone to plai with
i think it wa that unlucki joke of mine which first set mameena
think like a white ant in it tunnel as saduko said at least
after it her manner toward me chang she becam veri deferenti
she listen to my word as though thei were all wisdom i caught her
look at me with her soft ey as though i were quit an admir
object she began to talk to me of her difficulti her troubl and
her ambit she ask me for my advic as to saduko on thi point
i repli to her that if she love him and her father would allow it
presum she had better marri him
i like him well enough macumazahn although he weari me at time
but love oh tell me what is love then she clasp her slim hand
and gaze at me like a fawn
upon my word young woman i repli that is a matter upon which i
should have thought you more compet to instruct me
oh macumazahn she said almost in a whisper and let her head
droop like a fade lili you have never given me the chanc have
you and she laugh a littl look extrem attract
good graciousor rather it zulu equivalenti answer for i
began to feel nervou what do you mean mameena how could i there
i stop
i do not know what i mean macumazahn she exclaim wildli but
i know well enough what you meanthat you ar white as snow and i am
black as soot and that snow and soot dont mix well togeth

mingl thei make an ugli colour not that you ar like soot i ad
hastili fear to hurt her feel that is your hueand i touch
a copper bangl she wa wearinga veri love hue mameena like
everyth els about you

much for if there is on thing i hate it is to see a woman cry how
can a poor zulu girl be love oh macumazahn the spirit have dealt
hardli with me who have given me the colour of my peopl and the
heart of your if i were white now what you ar pleas to call thi
loveli of mine would be of some us to me for then then oh
cannot you guess macumazahn
i shook my head and said that i could not and next moment wa sorri
for she proceed to explain
sink to her kneesfor we were quit alon in the big hut and there
wa no on els about all the other women be engag on rural or
domest task for which mameena declar she had no time as her
busi wa to look after mesh rest her shape head upon my knee
and began to talk in a low sweet voic that sometim broke into a sob
then i will tell youi will tell you ye even if you hate me
afterward i could teach you what love is veri well macumazahn you
ar quit rightbecaus i love you sob no you shall not stir
till you have heard me out here she flung her arm about my leg and
held them tight so that without us great violenc it wa absolut
imposs for me to move when i saw you first all shatter and
senseless snow seem to fall upon my heart and it stop for a
littl while and ha never been the same sinc i think that someth
is grow in it macumazahn that make it big sob i us to like
saduko befor that but afterward i did not like him at allno
nor masapo eithery know he is the big chief who live over the
mountain a veri rich and power man who i believ would like
to marri me well as i went on nurs you my heart grew bigger and
bigger and now you see it ha burst sob nai stai still and do
not try to speak you shall hear me out it is the least you can do
see that you have caus me all thi pain if you did not want me to
love you why did you not curs at me and strike me as i am told white
men do to kafir girl she rose and went on

rule over a brave black peoplethousand and thousand of themthan
to be no on among the white think think there is wealth in the
land by your skill and knowledg the amabuto regiment could be
improv with the wealth you would arm them with gunsy and
byandby also with the throat of thunder that is or wa the
kafir name for cannon thei would be invinc chaka kingdom
would be noth to our for a hundr thousand warrior would sleep
on their spear wait for your word if you wish it even you could
sweep out natal and make the white there your subject too or perhap
it would be safer to let them be lest other should come across the
green water to help them and to strike northward where i am told
there ar great land as rich and fair in which none would disput our
sovereignti
cannon were call byandby by the nativ becaus
when fieldpiec first arriv in natal inquisit kafir
pester the soldier to show them how thei were fire

ad in a chang voic until i know that you will be my partner in
it i will not tell it even to you for perhap you might talkin your
sleep and then the fire in my breast would soon go outfor ever
i might talk now for the matter of that mameena

watcher sow my seedif thu he didh sow the dream that ar
a part of me also and i shall onli bring him back hi own with the
flower and the fruit by wai of interest but that is finish you
refus the great now tell me if i sink those dream in a great

there o dream it is not your hourif i do thi and stand befor
you just a woman who love and who swear by the spirit of her father
never to think or do that which ha not your blessingwil you love me
a littl macumazahn
now i wa silent for she had driven me to the last ditch and i knew
not what to sai moreov i will confess my weaknessi wa strang
move thi beauti girl with the fire in her heart thi woman who
wa differ from all other women that i had ever known seem to have
twist her slender finger into my heartstr and to be draw
me toward her it wa a great temptat and i bethought me of old
zikali sai in the black kloof and seem to hear hi giant laugh
she glide up to me she threw her arm about me and kiss me on the
lip and i think i kiss her back but realli i am not sure what i
did or said for my head swam when it clear again she wa stand in
front of me look at me reflect
now macumazahn she said with a littl smile that both mock and
dazzl the poor black girl ha you the wise experienc white man
in her net and i will show you that she can be gener do you think
that i do not read your heart that i do not know that you believ i
am drag you down to shame and ruin well i spare you macumazahn
sinc you have kiss me and spoken word which alreadi you mai have
forgotten but which i do not forget go your road macumazahn and i
go mine sinc the proud white man shall not be stain with my black

men and now lest you should be move to folli and forget your white
man pride i bid you farewel o macumazana when we meet again it
will be as friend onli
then she went leav me feel smaller than ever i felt in my life
befor or sinceeven smaller than when i walk into the presenc of
old zikali the wise why i wonder had she first made a fool of me
and then thrown awai the fruit of my folli to thi hour i cannot quit
answer the question though i believ the explan to be that she did
realli care for me and wa anxiou not to involv me in troubl and her
plot also she mai have been wise enough to see that our natur
were as oil and water and would never blend
chapter v two buck and the doe
it mai be thought that as a sequel to thi somewhat remark scene in
which i wa absolut bowl overperhap bowl out would be a better
termbi a kafir girl who after bend me to her will had the geniu
to drop me befor i repent as she knew i would do so soon as her back
wa turn therebi make me look the worst of fool that my relat
with that young ladi would have been strain but not a bit of it when
next we met which wa on the follow morn she wa just her easi
natur self attend to my hurt which by now were almost well
joke about thi and that inquir as to the content of certain
letter which i had receiv from natal and of some newspap that
came with themfor on all such matter she wa veri curiousand so
forth
imposs the clever critic will sayimposs that a savag could
act with such finish well friend critic that is just where you ar
wrong when you come to add it up there veri littl differ in all
main and essenti matter between the savag and yourself
to begin with by what exact right do we call peopl like the zulu
savag set asid the habit of polygami which after all is
common among veri highli civilis peopl in the east thei have a
social system not unlik our own thei have or had their king their
nobl and their common thei have an ancient and elabor law and
a system of moral in some wai as high as our own and certainli more
gener obei thei have their priest and their doctor thei ar
strictli upright and observ the rite of hospit
where thei differ from us mainli is that thei do not get drunk until the
white man teach them so to do thei wear less cloth the climat
be more genial their town at night ar not disgrac by the
sight that distinguish our thei cherish and ar never cruel to their
children although thei mai occasion put a deform infant or a twin
out of the wai and when thei go to war which is often thei carri out
the busi with a terribl thorough almost as terribl as that
which prevail in everi nation in europ a few gener ago
of cours there remain their witchcraft and the cruelti which result
from their almost univers belief in the power and effici of magic
well sinc i live in england i have been read up thi subject and
i find that quit recent similar cruelti were practis throughout
europethat is in a part of the world which for over a thousand year
ha enjoi the advantag of the knowledg and profess of the
christian faith
now let him who is highli cultur take up a stone to throw at the
poor untaught zulu which i notic the most dissolut and drunken
wretch of a white man is often readi to do gener becaus he covet
hi land hi labour or whatev els mai be hi
but i wander from my point which is that a clever man or woman among
the peopl whom we call savag is in all essenti veri much the same
as a clever man or woman anywher els
here in england everi child is educ at the expens of the countri
but i have not observ that the system result in the product of
more realli abl individu abil is the gift of natur and that
univers mother shed her favour imparti over all who breath
no not quit imparti perhap for the old greek and other were
exampl to the contrari still the gener rule obtain
to return mameena wa a veri abl person as she chanc to be a veri
love on a person who had she been favour by opportun would
doubtless have plai the part of a cleopatra with equal or greater
success sinc she share the beauti and the unscrupul of that
famou ladi and wa i believ capabl of her passion
i scarc like to mention the matter sinc it affect myself and
the natur vaniti of man make him prone to conclud that he is the
particular object of sole and undi devot could he know all the
fact of the case or case probabl he would be much undeceiv and
feel about as small as i did when mameena walk or rather crawl out
of the hut she could even crawl gracefulli still to be honestand
why should i not sinc all thi busi went beyond so long
agoi do believ that there wa a certain amount of truth in what she
saidthat for heaven know what reason she did take a fanci to me
which fanci continu dure her short and stormi life but the reader
of her stori mai judg for himself
within a fortnight of the dai of my discomfitur in the hut i wa quit
well and strong again my rib or whatev part of me it wa that the
buffalo had injur with hi iron knee have mend up also i wa
anxiou to be go have busi to attend to in natal and as no
more had been seen or heard of saduko i determin to trek homeward
leav a messag that he knew where to find me if he want me the
truth is that i wa by no mean keen on be involv in hi privat
war with bangu inde i wish to wash my hand of the whole matter
includ the fair mameena and her mock ey
so on morn have alreadi got up my oxen i told scowl to inspan
theman order which he receiv with joi for he and the other boi
wish to be off to civilis and it delight just as the oper
wa begin howev a messag came to me from old umbezi who beg
me to delai my departur till after noon as a friend of hi a big
chief had come to visit him who wish much to have the honour of
make my acquaint now i wish the big chief farther off but as
it seem rude to refus the request of on who had been so kind to me
i order the oxen to be unyok but kept at hand and in an irrit
frame of mind walk up to the kraal thi wa about half a mile from
my place of outspan for as soon as i wa suffici recov i
had begun to sleep in my wagon leav the big hut to the
wornoutoldcow
there wa no particular reason why i should be irrit sinc time
in those dai wa of no great account in zululand and it did not much
matter to me whether i trek in the morn or the afternoon but the
fact wa that i could not get over the propheci of zikali the littl
and wise that i wa destin to share saduko expedit against
bangu and although he had been right about the buffalo and mameena i
wa determin to prove him wrong in thi particular
if i had left the countri obvious i could not go against bangu at
ani rate at present but while i remain in it saduko might return at
ani moment and then doubtless i should find it hard to escap from
the kind of halfpromis that i had given to him
well as soon as i reach the kraal i saw that some kind of festiv
wa in progress for an ox had been kill and wa be cook some of
it in pot and some by roast also there were sever strang zulu
present within the fenc of the kraal seat in it shadow i found
umbezi and some of hi headmen and with them a great brawni ring
nativ who wore a tigerskin moocha as a mark of rank and some of
hi headmen also mameena wa stand near the gate dress in her
best bead and hold a gourd of kafir beer which evid she had
just been hand to the guest
would you have run awai without sai goodby to me macumazahn she
whisper to me as i came abreast of her that is unkind of you and i
should have wept much howev it wa not so fate
i wa go to ride up and bid farewel when the oxen were inspan
i answer but who is that man
you will find out present macumazahn look my father is beckon
to us
so i went on to the circl and as i advanc umbezi rose and take me
by the hand led me to the big man sai
thi is masapo chief of the amansomi of the quab race who desir
to know you macumazahn
veri kind of him i am sure i repli coolli as i threw my ey over
masapo he wa as i have said a big man and of about fifti year
of ag for hi hair wa ting with grei to be frank i took a great
dislik to him at onc for there wa someth in hi strong coars
face and hi air of insol pride which repel me then i wa
silent sinc among the zulu when two stranger of more or less equal
rank meet he who speak first acknowledg inferior to the other
therefor i stood and contempl thi new suitor of mameena wait
on event
masapo also contempl me then made some remark to on of hi
attend that i did not catch which caus the fellow to laugh
he ha heard that you ar an ipisi a great hunter broke in umbezi
who evid felt that the situat wa grow strain and that it
wa necessari to sai someth
ha he i answer then he is more fortun than i am for i have
never heard of him or what he is thi i am sorri to sai wa a fib
for it will be rememb that mameena had mention him in the hut as
on of her suitor but among nativ on must keep up on digniti
somehow friend umbezi i went on i have come to bid you farewel
as i am about to trek for durban
at thi junctur masapo stretch out hi great hand to me but without
rise and said
siyakubona that is gooddai white man
siyakubona black man i answer just touch hi finger while
mameena who had come up again with her beer and wa face me made a
littl grimac and titter
now i turn on my heel to go whereon masapo said in a coars growl
voic
o macumazana befor you leav us i wish to speak with you on a certain
matter will it pleas you to sit asid with me for a while
certainli o masapo and i walk awai a few yard out of hear
whither he follow me
macumazahn he said i give the gist of hi remark for he did not
come to the point at onc i need gun and i am told that you can
provid them be a trader
ye masapo i dare sai that i can at a price though it is a riski
busi smuggl gun into zululand but might i ask what you need
them for is it to shoot eleph
ye to shoot eleph he repli roll hi big ey round him
macumazahn i am told that you ar discreet that you do not shout
from the top of a hut what you hear within it now hearken to me our
countri is disturb we do not all of us love the seed of senzangakona
of whom the present king panda is on for instanc you mai know that
we quabiesfor my tribe the amansomi ar of that racesuff at
the spear of chaka well we think that a time mai come when we who live
on shrub like goat mai again brows on treetop like giraff for
panda is no strong king and he ha son who hate each other on of
whom mai need our spear do you understand
i understand that you want gun o masapo i answer dryli now as
to the price and place of deliveri
then we bargain for a while but the detail of that busi
transact of long ago will interest no on inde i onli mention the
matter to show that masapo wa plot to bring troubl on the rule
hous whereof panda wa the repres at that time
when we had conclud our rather nefari negoti which were to
the effect that i wa to receiv so mani cattl in return for so mani
gun if i could deliv them at a certain spot name umbezi kraal
i return to the circl where umbezi hi follow and guest were
sit purpos to bid him farewel by now howev meat had been
serv and as i wa hungri have had littl breakfast that morn
i stai to eat when i had finish my meal and wash it down with a
draught of tshwala that is kafir beer i rose to go but just at that
moment who should walk through the gate but saduko
piff said mameena who wa stand near me speak in a voic that
none but i could hear when two buck meet what happen macumazahn
sometim thei fight and sometim on run awai it depend veri much
on the doe i answer in the same low voic look at her
she shrug her shoulder fold her arm beneath her breast nod
to saduko as he pass then lean gracefulli against the fenc and
await event
greet umbezi said saduko in hi proud manner i see that you
feast am i welcom here
of cours you ar alwai welcom saduko repli umbezi uneasili
although as it happen i am entertain a great man and he look
toward masapo
i see said saduko ey the stranger but which of these mai be
the great man i ask that i mai salut him
you know well enough umfokazana that is low fellow exclaim
masapo angrili
i know that if you were outsid thi fenc masapo i would cram that
word down your throat at the point of my assegai repli saduko in a
fierc voic oh i can guess your busi here masapo and you can

i return here o umbezi to speak with the white chief macumazahn as
to where i have been that is my affair and not your or masapo
now if i were chief of thi kraal said masapo i would hunt out of
it thi hyena with a mangi coat and without a hole who come to devour
your meat and perhap he ad with mean to steal awai your
child
did i not tell you macumazahn that when two buck met thei would
fight whisper mameena suav into my ear
ye mameena you didor rather i told you but you did not tell me
what the doe would do
the doe macumazahn will crouch in her form and see what happensa

had caught a tiger
you do not speak o chief of the littl amansomi went on saduko who
wa besid himself with rage and jealousi you will not leav your beef
and beer to hunt the hyena who ar captain by an umfokazana well
then the umfokazana will speak and step up to masapo with the

masapowho wish me to kill anoth friend of mine and he jerk
hi thumb toward the kraal gate if i refus i offend on friend

tap the handl of the big doublebarrel pistol i carri
he shrank back mutter someth
oh dont apologis i said onli be more care in futur and
now i wish you a good dinner chief masapo and peac upon your kraal
friend umbezi
after thi speech i march off follow by the clamour of masapo
furiou attend and the sound of mameena light and mock
laughter
i wonder which of them she will marri i thought to myself as i set
out for the wagon
as i approach my camp i saw that the oxen were be inspan as i
suppos by the order of scowl who must have heard that there wa a row
up at the kraal and thought it well to be readi to bolt in thi i wa
mistaken howev for just then saduko stroll out of a patch of bush
and said
i order your boi to yoke up the oxen inkoosi
have you that cool i answer perhap you will tell me why
becaus we must make a good trek to the northward befor night
inkoosi
inde i thought that i wa head southeast
bangu doe not live in the south or the east he repli slowli
oh i had almost forgotten about bangu i said with a rather feebl
attempt at evas
is it so he answer in hi haughti voic i never knew befor that
macumazahn wa a man who broke a promis to hi friend
would you be so kind as to explain your mean saduko
is it need he answer shrug hi shoulder unless my ear
plai me trick you agre to go up with me against bangu well i
have gather the necessari menwith the king leavethei await us
yonder and he point with hi spear toward a dens patch of bush
that lai some mile beneath us but he ad if you desir to
chang your mind i will go alon onli then i think we had better bid
each other goodby sinc i love not friend who chang their mind
when the assegai begin to shake
now whether saduko spoke thu by design i do not know certainli
howev he could have found no better wai to ensur my companionship
for what it wa worth sinc although i had made no actual promis in
thi case i have alwai pride myself on keep even a halfbargain
with a nativ
i will go with you i said quietli and i hope that when it come to
the pinch your spear will be as sharp as your tongu saduko onli do
not speak to me again like that lest we should quarrel
as i said thi i saw a look of relief appear on hi face of veri great
relief
i prai your pardon my lord macumazahn he said seiz my hand
but oh there is a hole in my heart i think that mameena mean to
plai me fals and now that ha happen with yonder dog masapo which
will make her father hate me
if you will take my advic saduko i repli earnestli you will
let thi mameena fall out of the hole in your heart you will forget her
name you will have done with her ask me not why
perhap there is no need o macumazana perhap she ha been make
love to you and you have turn her awai as be what you ar and
my friend of cours you would do it is rather inconveni to be
set upon such a pedest at time but i did not attempt to assent or to
deni anyth much less to enter into explan
perhap all thi ha happen he continu or perhap it is she who
ha sent for masapo the hog i do not ask becaus if you know you will
not tell me moreov it matter noth while i have a heart mameena
will never drop out of it while i can rememb name her will never
be forgotten by me moreov i mean that she shall be my wife now i
am mind to take a few men and spear thi hog masapo befor we go up
against bangu for then he at ani rate will be out of my road
if you do anyth of the sort saduko you will go up against bangu
alon for i trek east at onc who will not be mix up with murder
then let it be inkoosi unless he attack me as my snake send that
he mai the hog can wait after all he will onli be grow a littl
fatter now if it pleas you order the wagon to trek i will show the
road for we must camp in that bush tonight where my peopl wait
me and there i will tell you my plan also you will find on with a
messag for you
chapter vi the ambush
we had reach the bush after six hour downhil trek over a pretti bad
track made by cattleof cours there were no road in zululand at thi
date i rememb the place well it wa a kind of spread woodland
on a flat bottom where tree of no great size grew spars some were
mimosa thorn other had deep green leav and bore a kind of plum with
an acid tast and a huge stone and other silvercolour leav in
their season a river too low at thi time of the year wound through
it and in the scrub upon it bank were mani guineafowl and other
bird it wa a pleas lone place with lot of game in it that
came here in the winter to eat the grass which wa lack on the
higher veld also it gave the idea of vast sinc wherev on
look there wa noth to be seen except a sea of tree
well we outspan by the river of which i forget the name at a spot
that saduko show us and set to work to cook our food that consist
of venison from a blue wildebeest on of a herd of these wildlook
anim which i had been fortun enough to shoot as thei whisk past
us gambol in and out between the tree
while we were eat i observ that arm zulu arriv continu in
parti of from six to a score of men and as thei arriv lift their
spear though whether in salut to saduko or to myself i did
not know and sat themselv down on an open space between us and the
riverbank although it wa difficult to sai whenc thei came for
thei appear like ghost out of the bush i thought it well to take no
notic of them sinc i guess that their come wa prearrang
who ar thei i whisper to scowl as he brought me my tot of
squarefac
saduko wild men he answer in the same low voic outlaw of hi
tribe who live among the rock
now i scan them sidewai while pretend to light my pipe and so
forth and certainli thei seem a remark savag set of peopl
great gaunt fellow with tangl hair who wore tatter skin upon
their shoulder and seem to have no possess save some snuff a few
sleepingmat and an ampl suppli of larg fight shield hardwood
kerri or knobstick and broad ixwa or stab assegai such
wa the look of them as thei sat round us in silent semicircl like
aasvgelsa the dutch call vulturessit round a dy ox
still i smoke on and took no notic
at length as i expect saduko grew weari of my silenc and spoke
these ar men of the amangwan tribe macumazahn three hundr of
them all that bangu left aliv for when their father were kill
the women escap with some of the children especi those of the
outli kraal i have gather them to be reveng upon bangu i who
am their chief by right of blood
quit so i answer i see that you have gather them but do thei
wish to be reveng on bangu at the risk of their own live
we do white inkoosi came the deepthroat answer from the three
hundr
and do thei acknowledg you saduko to be their chief
we do again came the answer then a spokesman step forward on of
the few greyhair men among them for most of these amangwan were of
the ag of saduko or even younger
o watcherbynight he said i am tshoza the brother of matiwan
saduko father the onli on of hi brother that escap the slaughter
on the night of the great kill is it not so
it is so exclaim the serri rank behind him
i acknowledg saduko as my chief and so do we all went on tshoza
so do we all echo the rank
sinc matiwan di we have live as we could o macumazana like
baboon among the rock without cattl often without a hut to shelter
us here on there on still we have live await the hour of
vengeanc upon bangu that hour which zikali the wise who is of our
blood ha promis to us now we believ that it ha come and on and
all from here from there from everywher we have gather at the
summon of saduko to be led against bangu and to conquer him or to die
is it not so amangwan
it is it is so came the deep unanim answer that caus the
stirless leav to shake in the still air
i understand o tshoza brother of matiwan and uncl of saduko the
chief i repli but bangu is a strong man live i am told in a
strong place still let that go for have you not said that you come
out to conquer or to die you who have noth to lose and if you
conquer you conquer and if you die you die and the tale is told but
suppos that you conquer what will panda king of the zulu sai to
you and to me also who stir up war in hi countri
now the amangwan look behind them and saduko cri out
appear messeng from panda the king
befor hi word had ceas to echo i saw a littl wither man
thread hi wai between the tall gaunt form of the amangwan he

hi high name into thi busi but that he on hi part must not
blame me for anyth that mai happen afterward have you the messag
i have it word for word and mai your spirit be with you macumazahn
when you attack the strong mountain of bangu which were i you maputa
ad reflect i think i should do just at the dawn sinc the
amakoba drink much beer and ar heavi sleeper
then we took a pinch of snuff togeth and he depart at onc for
nodwengu panda great place
fourteen dai had gone by and saduko and i with our rag band of
amangwan sat on morn after a long night march in the hilli
countri look across a broad vale which wa sprinkl with tree like
an english park at that mountain on the side of which bangu chief of
the amakoba had hi kraal
it wa a veri formid mountain and as we had alreadi observ the
path lead up to the kraal were ampli protect with stone wall in
which the open were quit narrow onli just big enough to allow on
ox to pass through them at a time moreov all these wall had been
strengthen recent perhap becaus bangu wa awar that panda look
upon him a northern chief dwell on the confin of hi dominion
with suspicion and even activ enmiti as he wa also no doubt awar
panda had good caus to do
here in a dens patch of bush that grew in a kloof of the hill we held
a council of war
so far as we knew our advanc had been unobserv for i had left my
wagon in the low veld thirti mile awai give it out among the local
nativ that i wa hunt game there and bring on with me onli
scowl and four of my best hunter all wellarm nativ who could
shoot the three hundr amangwan also had advanc in small parti
separ from each other pretend to be kafir march toward
delagoa bai now howev we had all met in thi bush among our number
were three amangwan who on the slaughter of their tribe had fled with
their mother to thi district and been brought up among the peopl of
bangu but who at hi summon had come back to saduko it wa on these
men that we reli at thi junctur for thei alon knew the countri
long and anxious did we consult with them first thei explain and
so far as the moonlight would allow for as yet the dawn had not broken
point out to us the variou path that led to bangu kraal
how mani men ar there in the town i ask
about seven hundr who carri spear thei answer togeth with
other in outli kraal moreov watchmen ar alwai set at the
gatewai in the wall
and where ar the cattl i ask again
here in the vallei beneath macumazahn answer the spokesman if
you listen you will hear them low fifti men not less watch them at
nighttwo thousand head of them or more
then it would not be difficult to get round these cattl and drive them
off leav bangu to breed up a new herd
it might not be difficult interrupt saduko but i came here to
kill bangu as well as to seiz hi cattl sinc with him i have a
blood feud
veri good i answer but that mountain cannot be storm with three
hundr men fortifi as it is with wall and schanz our band would
be destroi befor ever we came to the kraal sinc ow to the
sentri who ar set everywher it would be imposs to surpris the
place also you have forgotten the dog saduko moreov even if it
were possibl i will have noth to do with the massacr of women and
children which must happen in an assault now listen to me o saduko
i sai let us leav the kraal of bangu alon and thi come night send
fifti of our men under the leadership of the guid down to yonder
bush where thei will lie hid then after moonris when all ar
asleep these fifti must rush the cattl kraal kill ani who mai
oppos them should thei be seen and drive the herd out through
yonder great pass by which we have enter the land bangu and hi
peopl think that those who have taken the cattl ar but common
thiev of some wild tribe will gather and follow the beast to
recaptur them but we with the rest of the amangwan can set an
ambush in the narrowest part of the pass among the rock where the
grass is high and the euphorbia tree grow thick and there when thei
have pass the nek which i and my hunter will hold with our gun we
will give them battl what sai you
now saduko answer that he would rather attack the kraal which he
wish to burn but the old amangwan tshoza brother of the dead
matiwan said
no macumazahn watcherbynight is wise why should we wast our
strength on stone wall of which none know the number or can find the
gate in the dark and therebi leav our skull to be set up as
ornament on the fenc of the accurs amakoba let us draw the amakoba
out into the pass of the mountain where thei have no wall to protect
them and there fall on them when thei ar bewild and settl
the matter with them man to man as for the women and children with
macumazahn i sai let them go afterward perhap thei will becom
our women and children
ay answer the amangwan the plan of the white inkoosi is good
he is clever as a weasel we will have hi plan and no other
so saduko wa overrul and my counsel adopt
all that dai we rest light no fire and remain still as the
dead in the dens bush it wa a veri anxiou dai for although the
place wa so wild and lone there wa alwai the fear lest we should
be discov it wa true that we had travel mostli by night in
small parti to avoid leav a spoor and avoid all kraal still
some rumour of our approach might have reach the amakoba or a parti
of hunter might stumbl on us or those who sought for lost cattl
inde someth of thi sort did happen for about middai we heard a
footfal and perceiv the figur of a man whom by hi headdress we
knew for an amakoba thread hi wai through the bush befor he saw
us he wa in our midst for a moment he hesit er he turn to fly
and that moment wa hi last for three of the amangwan leapt on him
silent as leopard leap upon a buck and where he stood there he di
poor fellow evid he had been on a visit to some witchdoctor for
in hi blanket we found medicin and love charm thi doctor cannot
have been on of the stamp of zikali the dwarf i thought to myself
at least he had not warn him that he would never live to dose hi
belov with that foolish medicin
meanwhil a few of us who had the quickest ey climb tree and
thenc watch the town of bangu and the vallei that lai between us and
it soon we saw that so far at ani rate fortun wa plai into our
hand sinc herd after herd of kine were driven into the vallei dure
the afternoon and enclos in the stockkraal doubtless bangu intend
on the morrow to make hi halfyearli inspect of all the cattl of
the tribe mani of which were herd at a distanc from hi town
at length the long dai drew to it close and the shadow of the even
thicken then we made readi for our dread game of which the stake
wa the live of all of us sinc should we fail we could expect no
merci the fifti pick men were gather and at food in silenc
these men were place under the command of tshoza for he wa the most
experienc of the amangwan and led by the three guid who had dwelt
among the amakoba and who knew everi antheap in the land or so
thei swore their duti it will be rememb wa to cross the vallei
separ themselv into small parti unbar the variou cattl kraal
kill or hunt off the herdsmen and drive the beast back across the
vallei into the pass a second fifti men under the command of saduko
were to be left just at the end of thi pass where it open out into
the vallei in order to help and reinforc the cattlelift or if
need be to check the follow amakoba while the great herd of beast
were got awai and then fall back on the rest of us in our ambush nearli
two mile distant the manag of thi ambush wa to be my chargea
heavi on inde
now the moon would not be up till midnight but two hour befor that
time we began our move sinc the cattl must be driven out of the
kraal as soon as she appear and gave the need light otherwis
the fight in the pass would in all probabl be delai till after
sunris when the amakoba would see how small wa the number of their
foe terror doubt darknessthes must be our alli if our desper
ventur wa to succe
all wa arrang at last and the time had come we the three captain
of our divid forc bade each other farewel and pass the word
down the rank that should we be separ by the accid of war my
wagon were the meetingplac of ani who surviv
tshoza and hi fifti glide awai into the shadow silent as ghost
and were gone present the fiercefac saduko depart also with
hi fifti he carri the doublebarrel gun i had given him and
wa accompani by on of my best hunter a natal nativ who wa also
arm with a heavi smoothbor load with slug our hope wa that the
sound of these gun might terrifi the foe should there be occas to
us them befor our forc join up again and make them think thei
had to do with a bodi of raid dutch white men of whose roersa
the heavi eleph gun of that dai were calledal nativ were much
afraid
so saduko went with hi fifti leav me wonder whether i should
ever see hi face again then i my bearer scowl the two remain
hunter and the ten score amangwan who were left turn and soon were
follow the road by which we had come down the rug pass i call
it a road but in fact it wa noth but a waterwash gulli strewn
with boulder through which we must pick our wai as best we could in
the dark have first remov the percuss cap from the nippl of
everi gun for fear lest the accident discharg of on of them should
warn the amakoba confus our other parti and bring all our deeplaid
plan to noth
well we accomplish that march somehow walk in three long line
so that each man might keep touch with him in front and just as the
moon began to rise reach the spot that i had chosen for the ambush
certainli it wa well suit to that purpos here the track or gulli
bed narrow to a width of not more than a hundr feet while the steep
slope of the kloof on either side were cloth with scatter bush
and fingerlik euphorbia which grew among stone behind these stone
and bush we hid ourselv a hundr men on on side and a hundr on
the other whilst i and my three hunter who were arm with gun took
up a posit under shelter of a great boulder nearli five feet thick
that lai but a littl to the right of the gulli itself up which we
expect the cattl would come thi place i chose for two reason
first that i might keep touch with both wing of my forc and
secondli that we might be abl to fire straight down the path on the
pursu amakoba
these were the order that i gave to the amangwan warn them that he
who disobei would be punish with death thei were not to stir until
i or if i should be kill on of my hunter fire a shot for my
fear wa lest grow excit thei might leap out befor the time and
kill some of our own peopl who veri like would be mix up with the
first of the pursu amakoba secondli when the cattl had pass and
the signal had been given thei were to rush on the amakoba throw
themselv across the gulli so that the enemi would have to fight
upward on a steep slope
that wa all i told them sinc it is not wise to confus nativ by
give too mani order on thing i ad howeverthat thei must
conquer or thei must die there wa no merci for them it wa a case
of death or victori their spokesmanfor these peopl alwai find
a spokesmanansw that thei thank me for my advic that thei
understood and that thei would do their best then thei lift their
spear to me in salut a wild lot of men thei look in the moonlight
as thei depart to take shelter behind the rock and tree and wait
that wait wa long and i confess that befor the end it got upon
my nerv i began to think of all sort of thing such as whether
i should live to see the sun rise again also i reflect upon the
legitimaci of thi remark enterpris what right had i to involv
myself in a quarrel between these savag
why had i come here to gain cattl as a trader no for i wa not at
all sure that i would take them if gain becaus saduko had twit me
with faithless to my word ye to a certain extent but that wa
by no mean the whole reason i had been move by the recit of the
cruel wrong inflict upon saduko and hi tribe by thi bangu and
therefor had not been loath to associ myself with hi attempt
vengeanc upon a wick murder well that wa sound enough so far
as it went but now a new consider suggest itself to me those
wrong had been work mani year ago probabl most of the men who had
aid and abet them by now were dead or veri ag and it wa their
son upon whom the vengeanc would be wreak
what right had i to assist in visit the sin of the father upon the
son frankli i could not sai the thing seem to me to be a part of
the problem of life neither less nor more so i shrug my shoulder
sadli and consol myself by reflect that veri like the issu would
go against me and that my own exist would pai the price of the
ventur and expound it moral thi consider sooth my conscienc
somewhat for when a man back hi action with the risk of hi life
right or wrong at ani rate he plai no coward part
the time went by veri slowli and noth happen the wane moon shone
brightli in a clear sky and as there wa no wind the silenc seem
peculiarli intens save for the laugh of an occasion hyena and now
and again for a sound which i took for the cough of a distant lion
there wa no stir between sleep earth and moonlit heaven in which
littl cloud float beneath the pale star
at length i thought that i heard a nois a kind of murmur far awai it
grew it develop
it sound like a thousand stick tap upon someth hard veri
faintli it continu to grow and i knew the sound for that of the
beat hoof of anim gallop then there were isol nois
veri faint and thin thei might be shout then someth that i could
not mistakeshot fire at a distanc so the busi wa afoot the
cattl were move saduko and my hunter were fire there wa noth
for it but to wait
the excit wa veri fierc it seem to consum me to eat into
my brain the sound of the tap upon the rock grew louder until
it merg into a kind of rumbl mix with an echo as of that of veri
distant thunder which present i knew to be not thunder but the
bellow of a thousand frighten beast
nearer and nearer came the gallop hoof and the rumbl of bellow
nearer and nearer the shout of men affront the still of the
solemn night at length a singl anim appear a koodoo buck that
somehow had got mix up with the cattl it went past us like a flash
and wa follow a minut or so later by a bull that be young and
light had outrun it companion that too went by foam on it lip
and it tongu hang from it jaw
then the herd appeareda countless herd it seem to meplung up
the inclinecow heifer calv bull and oxen all mix togeth
in on inextric mass and everi on of them snort bellow
or make some other kind of sound the din wa fear the sight
bewild for the beast were of all colour and their long horn
flash like ivori in the moonlight inde the onli thing in the least
like it which i have ever seen wa the rush of the buffalo from the
reed camp on that dai when i got my injuri
thei were stream past us now a mighti and move mass so close
pack that a man might have walk upon their back in fact some of
the calv which had been thrust up by the pressur were be carri
along in thi fashion glad wa i that none of us were in their path
for their advanc seem irresist no fenc or wall could have save
us and even stout tree that grew in the gulli were snap or thrust
over
at length the long line began to thin for now it wa compos of
straggler and weak or injur beast of which there were mani other
sound too began to domin the bellow of the anim those
of the excit cri of men the first of our companion the
cattlelift appear weari and gasp but wave their spear in
triumph among them wa old tshoza i step upon my rock call to
him by name he heard me and present wa ly at my side pant
we have got them all he gasp not a hoof is left save those
that ar trodden down saduko is not far behind with the rest of our
brother except some that have been kill all the amakoba tribe ar
after us he hold them back to give the cattl time to get awai
well done i answer it is veri good now make your men hide among
the other that thei mai find their breath befor the fight
so he stop them as thei came scarc had the last of them vanish
into the bush when the gather volum of shout amongst which i
heard a gun go off told us that saduko and hi band and the pursu
amakoba were not far awai present thei too appearedthat is the
hand of amangwan didnot fight now but run as hard as thei
could for thei knew thei were approach the ambush and wish to pass
it so as not to be mix up with the amakoba we let them go through us
among the last of them came saduko who wa wound for the blood ran
down hi side support my hunter who wa also wound more sever
as i fear
i call to him
saduko i said halt at the crest of the path and rest there so that
you mai be abl to help us present
he wave the gun in answer for he wa too breathless to speak and
went on with those who were left of hi followingperhap thirti men in
allin the track of the cattl befor he wa out of sight the
amakoba arriv a mob of five or six hundr men mix up togeth
and advanc without order or disciplin for thei seem to have lost
their head as well as their cattl some of them had shield and some
had none some broad and some throw assegai while mani were quit
nake not have stai to put on their moocha and much less their war
fineri evid thei were mad with rage for the sound that issu
from them seem to concentr into on mighti curs
the moment had come though to tell the truth i heartili wish that
it had not i wasnt exactli afraid although i never set up for great
courag but i did not quit like the busi after all we were
steal these peopl cattl and now were go to kill as mani
of them as we could i had to recal saduko dread stori of the
massacr of hi tribe befor i could make up my mind to give the
signal that harden me and so did the reflect that after all thei
outnumb us enorm and veri like would prove victor in the
end anyhow it wa too late to repent what a tricki and uncomfort
thing is conscienc that nearli alwai begin to troubl us at the
moment of or after the event not befor when it might be of some
us
i rais myself upon the rock and fire both barrel of my gun into the
advanc hord though whether i kill anyon or no i cannot sai i
have alwai hope that i did not but as the mark wa larg and i am a
fair shot i fear that is scarc possibl next moment with a howl
that sound like that of wild beast from either side of the gorg the
fierc amangwan freespearsfor that is what thei wereleapt out of
their hidingplac and hurl themselv upon their hereditari foe
thei were fight for more than cattl thei were fight for hate and
for reveng sinc these amakoba had slaughter their father and their
mother their sister and their brother and thei alon remain to
pai them back blood for blood
great heaven how thei did fight more like devil than human be
after that first howl which shape itself to the word saduko thei
were silent as bulldog though thei were so few at first their
terribl rush drove back the amakoba then as these recov from
their surpris the weight of number began to tell for thei too were
brave men who did not give wai to panic score of them went down at
onc but the remaind push the amangwan befor them up the hill i
took littl share in the fight but wa thrust backward with the other
onli fire when i wa oblig to save my own life foot by foot we were
push back till at length we drew near to the crest of the pass
then while the issu hung in the balanc there wa anoth shout of
saduko and that chief himself follow by hi thirti rush upon
the amakoba
thi charg decid the battl for not know how mani more were
come those who were left of the amakoba turn and fled nor did we
pursu them far
we muster on the hilltop not more than two hundr of us now the
rest were fallen or desper wound my poor hunter whom i had lent
to saduko be among the dead although wound he di fight to
the last then fell down shout to me
chief have i done well and expir
i wa breathless and spent but as in a dream i saw some amangwan drag
up a gaunt old savag cry
here is bangu bangu the butcher whom we have caught aliv
saduko step up to him
ah bangu he said now sai why should i not kill you as you would
have kill the littl lad saduko long ago had not zikali save him
see here is the mark of your spear
kill said bangu your spirit is stronger than mine did not zikali
foretel it kill saduko
nai answer saduko if you ar weari i am weari too and wound
as well take a spear bangu and we will fight
so thei fought there in the moonlight man to man fought fierc while
all watch till present i saw bangu throw hi arm wide and fall
backward
saduko wa aveng i have alwai been glad that he slew hi enemi thu
and not as it might have been expect that he would do
chapter vii saduko bring the marriag gift
we reach my wagon in the earli morn of the follow dai bring
with us the cattl and our wound thu encumb it wa a most
toilsom march and an anxiou on also for it wa alwai possibl that
the remnant of the amakoba might attempt pursuit thi howev thei
did not do for veri mani of them were dead or wound and those who
remain had no heart left in them thei went back to their mountain
home and live there in shame and wretched for i do not believ
there were fifti head of cattl left among the tribe and kafir without
cattl ar noth still thei did not starv sinc there were plenti
of women to work the field and we had not touch their corn the
end of them wa that panda gave them to their conqueror saduko and he
incorpor them with the amangwan but that did not happen until some
time afterward
when we had rest a while at the wagon the captur beast were
muster and on be count were found to number a littl over twelv
hundr head not reckon anim that had been badli hurt in the
flight which we kill for beef it wa a nobl prize truli and
notwithstand the wound in hi thigh which hurt him a good deal now
that it had stiffen saduko stood up and survei them with glisten
ey no wonder for he who had been so poor wa now rich and would
remain so even after he had paid over whatev number of cow umbezi
chose to demand as the price of mameena hand moreov he wa sure
and i share hi confid that in these chang circumst both
that young woman and her father would look upon hi suit with veri
favour ey he had so to speak succeed to the titl and the
famili estat by mean of a lawsuit brought in the court of the
assegai and therefor there wa hardli a father in zululand who would
shut hi kraal gate upon him we forgot both of us the proverb that
point out how numer ar the slip between the cup and the lip
which by the wai is on that ha it zulu equival on of them if
i rememb right at the moment is howev loud the hen cackl the
housewif doe not alwai get the egg
as it chanc although saduko hen wa cackl veri loudli just at
thi time he wa not destin to find the covet egg but of that
matter i will speak in it place
i too look at those cattl wonder whether saduko would rememb
our bargain under which some six hundr head of them belong to me
six hundr head why put them at 5 apiec all roundand as oxen
were veri scarc just at that time thei were worth quit as much if
not morethat meant 3000 a larger sum of monei than i had ever own
at on time in all my life truli the path of violenc were profit
but would he rememb on the whole i thought probabl not sinc kafir
ar not fond of part with cattl
well i did him an injustic for present he turn and said with
someth of an effort
macumazahn half of all these belong to you and truli you have earn
them for it wa your cun and good counsel that gain us the
victori now we will choos them beast by beast
so i chose a fine ox then saduko chose on and so it went on till i
had eight of my number driven out as the eighth wa taken i turn to
saduko and said
there that will do these oxen i must have to replac those in my
team which di on the trek but i want no more
wow said saduko and all those who stood with him while on of them
addedi think it wa old tshoza
he refus six hundr cattl which ar fairli hi he must be mad
no friend i answer i am not mad but neither am i bad i
accompani saduko on thi raid becaus he is dear to me and stood by
me onc in the hour of danger but i do not love kill men with whom i
have no quarrel and i will not take the price of blood
wow said old tshoza again for saduko seem too astonish to speak
he is a spirit not a man he is holi
not a bit of it i answer if you think that ask mameenaa dark
sai which thei did not understand now listen i will not take
those cattl becaus i do not think as you kafir think but as thei ar
mine accord to your law i am go to dispos of them i give ten
head to each of my hunter and fifteen head to the relat of him
who wa kill the rest i give to tshoza and to the other men of
the amangwan who fought with us to be divid among them in such
proport as thei mai agre i be the judg in the event of ani
quarrel aris
now these men rais a great cry of inkoosi and run up old
tshoza seiz my hand and kiss it
your heart is big he cri you drop fat although you ar
so small the spirit of a king live in you and the wisdom of the
heaven
thu he prais me while all the other join in till the din wa
aw saduko thank me also in hi magnific manner yet i do not
think that he wa altogeth pleas although my great gift reliev
him from the necess of share up the spoil with hi companion
the truth wa or so i believ that he understood that henceforth the
amangwan would love me better than thei love him thi inde prove
to be the case for i am sure that there wa no man among all those wild
fellow who would not have serv me to the death and to thi dai my
name is a power among them and their descend also it ha grown into
someth of a proverb among all those kafir who know the stori
thei talk of ani great act of liber in an idiom as a gift of
macumazana and in the same wai of on who make ani remark
renunci as a wearer of macumazana blanket or as he who ha
stolen macumazana shadow
thu did i earn a great reput veri cheapli for realli i could not
have taken those cattl also i am sure that had i done so thei would
have brought me bad luck inde on of the regret of my life is that
i had anyth whatsoev to do with the busi

she hate to be disturb dont you think that you could come back
sai tomorrow morn she will be sure to be up by then or better
still the dai after
in which hut is mameena ask saduko sternli while i smell a
rat began to chuckl to myself
i realli do not know saduko repli umbezi sometim she sleep in
on sometim in anoth and sometim she goe sever hour journei
awai to her aunt kraal for a chang i should not be in the least
surpris if she had done so last night i have no control over
mameena
befor saduko could answer a shrill rasp voic broke upon our ear
which after some search i saw proceed from an ugli and ancient femal
seat in the shadow in whom i recognis the ladi who wa known by the
pleas name of wornoutoldcow
he li screech the voic he li thank be to the spirit of my
ancestor that wild cat mameena ha left thi kraal for good she slept
last night not with her aunt but with her husband masapo to whom
umbezi gave her in marriag two dai ago receiv in payment a
hundr and twenti head of cattl which wa twenti more than you bid
saduko
now when saduko heard these word i thought that he would realli go
mad with rage he turn quit grei under hi dark skin and for a while
trembl like a leaf look as though he were about to fall to the
ground then he leapt as a lion leap and seiz umbezi by the throat
hurl him backward stand over him with rais spear
you dog he cri in a terribl voic tell me the truth or i will
rip you up what have you done with mameena
oh saduko answer umbezi in choke tone mameena ha chosen to
get marri it wa no fault of mine she would have her wai
he got no farther and had i not interven by throw my arm about
saduko and drag him back that moment would have been umbezi
last for saduko wa about to pin him to the earth with hi spear as it
prove i wa just in time and saduko be weak with emot for i
felt hi heart go like a sledgehamm could not break from my grasp
befor hi reason return to him
at length he recov himself a littl and threw down hi spear as
though to put himself out of temptat then he spoke alwai in the
same terribl voic ask
have you more to sai about thi busi umbezi i would hear all
befor i answer you
onli thi saduko repli umbezi who had risen to hi feet and wa
shake like a reed i did no more than ani other father would have
done masapo is a veri power chief on who will be a good stick for
me to lean on in my old ag mameena declar that she wish to marri
him
he li screech the old cow what mameena said wa that she had
no will toward marriag with ani zulu in the land so i suppos she is
look after a white man and she leer in my direct she said
howev that if her father wish to marri her to masapo she must be
a duti daughter and obei him but that if blood and troubl came of
that marriag let it be on hi head and not on her
would you also stick your claw into me cat shout umbezi catch
the old woman a savag cut across the back with the light dancingstick
which he still held in hi hand whereon she fled awai screech and
curs him
oh saduko he went on let not your ear be poison by these
falsehood mameena never said anyth of the sort or if she did it
wa not to me well the moment that my daughter had consent to take
masapo as her husband hi peopl drove a hundr and twenti of the most
beauti cattl over the hill and would you have had me refus them
saduko i am sure that when you have seen them you will sai that i
wa quit right to accept such a splendid lobola in return for on
sharptongu girl rememb saduko that although you had promis a
hundr head that is less by twenti at the time you did not own on
and where you were to get them from i could not guess moreov he
ad with a last desper imagin effort for i think he saw
that hi argument were make no impress some stranger who call
here told me that both you and macumazahn had been kill by certain
evildo in the mountain there i have spoken and saduko if you
now have cattl why on my part i have anoth daughter not quit so
goodlook perhap but a much better worker in the field come and
drink a sup of beer and i will send for her
stop talk about your other daughter and your beer and listen to me
repli saduko look at the assegai which he had thrown to the ground
so omin that i set my foot on it i am now a greater chief
than the boar masapo ha masapo such a bodyguard as these
eatersupofenemi and he jerk hi thumb backward toward the
serri line of fiercefac amangwan who stood listen behind us
ha masapo as mani cattl as i have whereof those which you see ar
but a tith brought as a lobola gift to the father of her who had been
promis to me as wife is masapo panda friend i think that i have
heard otherwis ha masapo just conquer a countless tribe by hi
courag and hi wit is masapo young and of high blood or is he but an
old lowborn boar of the mountain
you do not answer umbezi and perhap you do well to be silent now
listen again were it not for macumazahn here whom i do not desir to
mix up with my quarrel i would bid my men take you and beat you to
death with the handl of their spear and then go on and serv the
boar in the same fashion in hi mountain sty as it is these thing
must wait a littl while especi as i have other matter to attend
to first yet the dai is not far off when i will attend to them also
therefor my counsel to you cheat is to make hast to die or to find
courag to fall upon a spear unless you would learn how it feel to be
brai with stick like a green hide until none can know that you
were onc a man send now and tell my word to masapo the boar and to
mameena sai that soon i will come to take her with spear and not with
cattl do you understand oh i see that you do sinc alreadi you weep
with fear like a woman then farewel to you till that dai when i
return with the stick o umbezi the cheat and the liar umbezi
eaterupofeleph and turn saduko stalk awai
i wa about to follow in a great hurri have had enough of thi veri
unpleas scene when poor old umbezi sprang at me and clasp me by
the arm
o macumazana he exclaim weep in hi terror o macumazana
if ever i have been a friend to you help me out of thi deep pit into
which i have fallen through the trick of that monkei of a daughter of
mine who i think is a witch born to bring troubl upon men macumazahn
if she had been your daughter and a power chief had appear with a
hundr and twenti head of such beauti cattl you would have given
her to him would you not although he is of mix blood and not veri
young especi as she did not mind who onli care for place and
wealth
i think not i answer but then it is not our custom to sell women
in that fashion
no no i forgot in thi as in other matter you white men ar mad
and macumazahn to tell you the truth i believ it is you she realli
care for she said as much to me onc or twice well why did you not
take her awai when i wa not look we could have settl matter
afterward and i should have been free of her witcheri and not up to
my neck in thi hole as i am now
becaus some peopl dont do that kind of thing umbezi
no no i forgot oh why can i not rememb that you ar quit mad
and therefor that it must not be expect of you to act as though you
were sane well at least you ar that tiger saduko friend which
again show that you must be veri mad for most peopl would sooner try
to milk a cow buffalo than walk hand in hand with him dont you see
macumazahn that he mean to kill me macumazahn to brai me like a
green hide ugh to beat me to death with stick ugh and what is more
that unless you prevent him he will certainli do it perhap tomorrow
or the next dai ugh ugh ugh
ye i see umbezi and i think that he will do it but what i do not
see is how i am to prevent him rememb that you let mameena grow into
hi heart and behav badli to him umbezi
i never promis her to him macumazahn i onli said that if he brought
a hundr cattl then i might promis
well he ha wipe out the amakoba the enemi of hi hous and there
ar the hundr cattl whereof he ha mani more and now it is too late
for you to keep your share of the bargain so i think you must make
yourself as comfort as you can in the hole that your hand dug
umbezi which i would not share for all the cattl in zululand
truli you ar not on from whom to seek comfort in the hour of
distress groan poor umbezi then ad brighten up but perhap
panda will kill him becaus he ha wipe out bangu in a time of peac
oh macumazahn can you not persuad panda to kill him if so i now have
more cattl than i realli want
imposs i answer panda is hi friend and between ourselv i
mai tell you that he at up the amakoba by hi especi wish when the
king hear of it he will call to saduko to sit in hi shadow and make
him great on of hi councillor probabl with power of life and death
over littl peopl like you and masapo
then it is finish said umbezi faintli and i will try to die
like a man but to be brai like a hide and with thin stick oh he
ad grind hi teeth if onli i can get hold of mameena i will
not leav much of that pretti hair of her upon her head i will tie her
hand and shut her up with the old cow who love her as a meercat
love a mous no i will kill her theredo you hear macumazahn
unless you do someth to help me i will kill mameena and you wont
like that for i am sure she is dear to you although you were not man
enough to run awai with her as she wish
if you touch mameena i said be certain my friend that saduko
stick and your skin will not be far apart for i will report you to
panda myself as an unnatur evildo now hearken to me you old fool
saduko is so fond of your daughter on thi point be mad as you sai
i am that if onli he could get her i think he might overlook the fact
of her have been marri befor what you have to do is to try to
bui her back from masapo mind you i sai bui her backnot get her
by bloodshedwhich you might do by persuad masapo to put her awai
then if he knew that you were try to do thi i think that saduko
might leav hi stick uncut for a while
i will try i will inde macumazahn i will try veri hard it is true
masapo is an obstin pig still if he know that hi own life is
at stake he might give wai moreov when she learn that saduko
ha grown rich and great mameena might help me oh i thank you
macumazahn you ar inde the prop of my hut and it and all in it ar
your farewel farewel macumazahn if you must go but whywhi did
you not run awai with mameena and save me all thi fear and troubl
so i and that old humbug umbezi eaterupofeleph part for
a while and never did i know him in a more chasten frame of mind
except onc as i shall tell
chapter viii the king daughter
when i got back to my wagon after thi semitrag interview with
that bombast and selfseek old windbag umbezi it wa to find
that saduko and hi warrior had alreadi march for the king kraal
nodwengu a messag await me howev to the effect that it wa
hope that i would follow in order to make report of the affair of the
destruct of the amakoba thi after reflect i determin to
do realli i think becaus of the intens human interest of the whole
busi i want to see how it would work out
also in a wai i read saduko mind and understood that at the moment
he did not wish to discuss the matter of hi hideou disappoint
whatev els mai have been fals in thi man natur on thing
rang true name hi love or hi infatu for the girl mameena
throughout hi life she wa hi guid starabout as evil a star as
could have arisen upon ani man horizon the fatal star that wa to
light him down to doom let me thank provid as i do that i wa
so fortun as to escap it bane influenc although i admit that
thei attract me not a littl
so seduc thither by my curios which ha so often led me into
troubl i trek to nodwengu full of mani doubt not unmingl with
amus for i could not rid my mind of recollect of the utter
terror of the eaterupofeleph when he wa brought face to face
with the dread and concentr rage of the rob saduko and the
promis of hi vengeanc ultim i arriv at the great place
without experienc ani adventur that is worthi of record and camp
in a spot that wa appoint to me by some induna whose name i forget
but who evid knew of my approach for i found him await me at
some distanc from the town here i sat for quit a long while two or
three dai if i rememb right amus myself with kill or miss
turtledov with a shotgun and similar pastim until someth
should happen or i grew tire and start for natal
in the end just as i wa about to trek seaward an old friend maputa
turn up at my wagonsthat same man who had brought me the messag
from panda befor we start to attack bangu
greet macumazahn he said what of the amakoba i see thei did
not kill you
no i answer hand him some snuff thei did not quit kill me
for here i am what is your pleasur with me
o macumazana onli that the king wish to know whether you have ani of
those littl ball left in the box which i brought back to you sinc
if so he think he would like to swallow on of them in thi hot
weather
i proffer him the whole box but he would not take it sai that the
king would like me to give it to him myself now i understood that thi
wa a summon to an audienc and ask when it would pleas panda
to receiv me and thelittleblackstonesthatworkwond he
answeredat onc
so we start and within an hour i stood or rather sat befor panda
like all hi famili the king wa an enorm man but unlik chaka and
those of hi brother whom i had known on of a kindli counten
i salut him by lift my cap and took my place upon a wooden stool
that had been provid for me outsid the great hut in the shadow of
which he sat within hi isigohlo or privat enclosur
greet o macumazana he said i am glad to see you safe and well
for i understand that you have been engag upon a peril adventur
sinc last we met
ye king i answer but to which adventur do you referthat
of the buffalo when saduko help me or that of the amakoba when i
help saduko
the latter macumazahn of which i desir to hear all the stori
so i told it to him he and i be alon for he command hi
councillor and servant to retir out of hear
wow he said when i had finish you ar clever as a baboon
macumazahn that wa a fine trick to set a trap for bangu and hi
amakoba dog and bait it with hi own cattl but thei tell me that you
refus your share of those cattl now why wa that macumazahn
by wai of answer i repeat to panda my reason which i have set out
alreadi
ah he exclaim when i had finish everi on seek great in
hi own wai and perhap your is better than our well the white man
walk on roador some of them doand the black man anoth thei both
end at the same place and none will know which is the right road till
the journei is done meanwhil what you lose saduko and hi peopl
gain he is a wise man saduko who know how to choos hi friend and
hi wisdom ha brought him victori and gift but to you macumazahn it
ha brought noth but honour on which if a man feed onli he will
grow thin
i like to be thin o panda i answer slowli
ye ye i understand repli the king who in common with most
nativ wa quick enough to seiz a point and i too like peopl who
keep thin on such food as your peopl also whose hand ar alwai
clean we zulu trust you macumazahn as we trust few white men for we
have known for year that your lip sai what your heart think and
that your heart alwai think the thing which is good you mai be name
watcherbynight but you love light not dark
now at these somewhat unusu compliment i bow and felt myself
colour a littl as i did so even through my sunburn but i made no
answer to them sinc to do so would have involv a discuss of the
past and it tragic event into which i had no wish to enter panda
too remain silent for a while then he call to a messeng to
summon the princ cetewayo and umbelazi and to bid saduko the son of
matiwan to wait without in case he should wish to speak with him
a few minut later the two princ arriv i watch their come with
interest for thei were the most import men in zululand and alreadi
the nation debat fierc which of them would succe to the throne i
will try to describ them a littl
thei were both of much the same ageit is alwai difficult to arriv
at a zulu exact yearsand both fine young men cetewayo howev had
the stronger counten it wa said that he resembl that fierc and
abl monster chaka the wild beast hi uncl and certainli i perceiv
in him a like to hi other uncl dingaan umpanda predecessor
whom i had known but too well when i wa a lad he had the same surli
ey and haughti bear also when he wa angri hi mouth shut itself
in the same iron fashion
of umbelazi it is difficult for me to speak without enthusiasm as
mameena wa the most beauti woman i ever saw in zululandalthough
it is true that old wardog umslopogaa a friend of mine who doe not
come into thi stori us to tell me that nada the lili whom i have
mention wa even lovelierso umbelazi wa by far the most splendid
man inde the zulu name him umbelazi the handsom and no wonder
to begin with he stood at least three inch abov the tallest of them
from a quarter of a mile awai i have recognis him by hi great
height even through the dust of a desper battl and hi breadth
wa proportion to hi statur then he wa perfectli made hi great
shape limb end like saduko in small hand and feet hi face
too wa wellcut and open hi colour lighter than cetewayo and hi
ey which alwai seem to smile were larg and dark
even befor thei pass the small gate of the inner fenc it wa easi
for me to see that thi royal pair were not upon the best of term
for each of them tri to get through it first to show hi right of
preced the result wa somewhat ludicr for thei jam in the
gatewai here howev umbelazi greater weight told for put out
hi strength he squeez hi brother into the reed of the fenc and
won through a foot or so in front of him
you grow too fat my brother i heard cetewayo sai and saw him scowl
as he spoke if i had held an assegai in my hand you would have been
cut
i know it my brother answer umbelazi with a goodhumour laugh
but i knew also that none mai appear befor the king arm had it been
otherwis i would rather have follow after you
now at thi hint of umbelazi that he would not trust hi brother
behind hi back with a spear although it seem to be convei in jest
i saw panda shift uneasili on hi seat while cetewayo scowl even more
omin than befor howev no further word pass between them
and walk up to the king side by side thei salut him with rais
hand call out babathat is father
greet my children said panda ad hastili for he foresaw a
quarrel as to which of them should take the seat of honour on hi right
sit there in front of me both of you and macumazahn do you come
hither and he point to the covet place i am a littl deaf in my
left ear thi morn
so these brother sat themselv down in front of the king nor were
thei i think griev to find thi wai out of their rivalri but first
thei shook hand with me for i knew them both though not well and
even in thi small matter the old troubl aros sinc there wa
some difficulti as to which of them should first offer me hi hand
ultim i rememb cetewayo won thi trick
when these preliminari were finish panda address the princ
sai
my son i have sent for you to ask your counsel upon a certain
matternot a larg matter but on that mai grow and he paus to
take snuff whereon both of them ejacul
we hear you father
well my son the matter is that of saduko the son of matiwan chief
of the amangwan whom bangu chief of the amakoba at up year ago by
leav of him who went befor me now thi bangu as you know ha for
some time been a thorn in my foota thorn that caus it to festerand
yet i did not wish to make war on him so i spoke a word in the ear of
saduko sai he is your if you can kill him and hi cattl ar
your well saduko is not dull with the help of thi white man
macumazahn our friend from of old he ha kill bangu and taken hi
cattl and alreadi my foot is begin to heal
we have heard it said cetewayo
it wa a great deed ad umbelazi a more gener critic
ye continu panda i too think it wa a great deed see that
saduko had but a small regiment of wander to back him
nai interrupt cetewayo it wa not those eater of rat who won
him the dai it wa the wisdom of thi macumazahn
macumazahn wisdom would have been of littl us without the courag
of saduko and hi rat comment umbelazi and from thi moment i saw
that the two brother were take side for and against saduko as thei
did upon everi other matter not becaus thei care for the right of
whatev wa in question but becaus thei wish to oppos each other
quit so went on the king i agre with both of you my son but
the point is thi i think saduko a man of promis and on who should
be advanc that he mai learn to love us all especi as hi hous
ha suffer wrong from our hous sinc hewhoisgon listen to
the evil counsel of bangu and allow him to kill out matiwan tribe
without just caus therefor in order to wipe awai thi stain and
bind saduko to us i think it well to reestablish saduko in the
chieftainship of the amangwan with the land that hi father held and
to give him also the chieftainship of the amakoba of whom it seem
that the women and children with some of the men remain although he
alreadi hold their cattl which he ha captur in war
as the king pleas said umbelazi with a yawn for he wa grow
weari of listen to the case of saduko
but cetewayo said noth for he appear to be think of someth
els
i think also went on panda in a rather uncertain voic in order to
bind him so close that the bond mai never be broken it would be wise
to give him a woman of our famili in marriag
why should thi littl amangwan be allow to marri into the royal
hous ask cetewayo look up if he is danger why not kill
him and have done
for thi reason my son there is troubl ahead in zululand and i do
not wish to kill those who mai help us in that hour nor do i wish
them to becom our enemi i wish that thei mai be our friend and
therefor it seem to me wise when we find a seed of great to
water it and not to dig it up or plant it in a neighbour garden from
hi deed i believ that thi saduko is such a seed
our father ha spoken said umbelazi and i like saduko who is a man
of mettl and good blood which of our sister doe our father propos
to give to him
she who is name after the mother of our race o umbelazi she whom
your own mother boreyour sister nandi in english the sweet
a great gift o my father sinc nandi is both fair and wise also
what doe she think of thi matter
she think well of it umbelazi for she ha seen saduko and taken a
like to him she told me herself that she wish no other husband
is it so repli umbelazi indiffer then if the king command
and the king daughter desir what more is there to be said
much i think broke in cetewayo i hold that it is out of place that
thi littl man who ha but conquer a littl tribe by borrow
the wit of macumazahn here should be reward not onli with a
chieftainship but with the hand of the wisest and most beauti of the
king daughter even though umbelazi he ad with a sneer should
be will to throw him hi own sister like a bone to a pass dog
who threw the bone cetewayo ask umbelazi awak out of hi
indiffer wa it the king or wa it i who never heard of the
matter till thi moment and who ar we that we should question the
king decre is it our busi to judg or to obei
ha saduko perchanc made you a present of some of those cattl which
he stole from the amakoba umbelazi ask cetewayo as our father
ask no lobola perhap you have taken the gift instead
the onli gift that i have taken from saduko said umbelazi who i
could see wa hard press to keep hi temper is that of hi servic
he is my friend which is why you hate him as you hate all my friend
must i then love everi strai cur that lick your hand umbelazi oh no
need to tell me he is your friend for i know it wa you who put it
into our father heart to allow him to kill bangu and steal hi cattl
which i hold to be an ill deed for now the great hous is thatch
with hi reed and bangu blood is on it doorpost moreov he who
wrought the wrong is to come and dwell therein and for aught i know
to be call a princ like you and me why should he not sinc the
princess nandi is to be given to him in marriag certainli umbelazi
you would do well to take the cattl which thi white trader ha
refus for all men know that you have earn them
now umbelazi sprang up straighten himself to the full of hi great
height and spoke in a voic that wa thick with passion
i prai your leav to withdraw o king he said sinc if i stai here
longer i shall grow sorri that i have no spear in my hand yet befor i
go i will tell the truth cetewayo hate saduko becaus know him
to be a chief of wit and courag who will grow great he sought him for
hi man sai sit you in my shadow after he had promis to sit in
mine therefor it is that he heap these taunt upon me let him deni
it if he can
that i shall not troubl to do umbelazi answer cetewayo with a
scowl who ar you that spy upon my do and with a mouth full of
li call me to account befor the king i will hear no more of it do
you bide here and pai saduko hi price with the person of our sister
for as the king ha promis her hi word cannot be chang onli let
your dog know that i keep a stick for him if he should snarl at me
farewel my father i go upon a journei to my own lordship the land
of gikazi and there you will find me when you want me which i prai
mai not be till after thi marriag is finish for on that i will not
trust my ey to look
then with a salut he turn and depart bid no goodby to hi

who will report the matter which make it wors he ha no right
to dictat to me to whom i shall or shall not give my daughter in

threaten me it is known throughout the land that i never chang my
word and the white men know it also do thei not o macumazana

panda wa veri obstin and honest too in hi own fashion
he wave hi hand to show that the subject wa end then bade
umbelazi go to the gate and send a messeng to bring in the son of
matiwan
present saduko arriv look veri state and compos as he lift
hi right hand and gave panda the bayteth royal salut
be seat said the king i have word for your ear
thereon with the most perfect grace without hurri and without undu
delai saduko crouch himself down upon hi knee with on of hi
elbow rest on the ground as onli a nativ know how to do without
look absurd and wait
son of matiwan said the king i have heard all the stori of how
with a small compani you destroi bangu and most of the men of the
amakoba and at up their cattl everi on
your pardon black on interrupt saduko i am but a boi i did
noth it wa macumazahn watcherbynight who sit yonder hi
wisdom taught me how to snare the amakoba after thei were decoi from
their mountain and it wa tshoza my uncl who loos the cattl from
the kraal i sai that i did noth except to strike a blow or two
with a spear when i must just as a baboon throw stone at those who
would steal it young
i am glad to see that you ar no boaster saduko said panda would
that more of the zulu were like you in that matter for then i must not
listen to so mani loud song about littl thing at least bangu wa
kill and hi proud tribe humbl and for reason of state i am glad
that thi happen without my move a regiment or be mix up with
the busi for i tell you that there ar some of my famili who love
bangu but ii love your father matiwan whom bangu butcher for
we were brought up togeth as boysy and serv togeth in the
same regiment the amawomb when the wild on my brother rule
he meant chaka for among the zulu the name of dead king ar
hlonipathat is thei must not be spoken if it can be avoid
therefor went on panda for thi reason and for other i am glad
that bangu ha been punish and that although vengeanc ha crawl
after him like a footsor bull at length he ha been toss with it
horn and crush with it knee
yebo ngonyama ye o lion said saduko
now saduko went on panda becaus you ar your father son and
becaus you have shown yourself a man although you ar still littl
in the land i am mind to advanc you therefor i give to you the
chieftainship over those who remain of the amakoba and over all of the
amangwan blood whom you can gather
bayt as the king pleas said saduko
and i give you leav to becom a kehlaa wearer of the
headringalthough as you have said you ar still but a boi and with
it a place upon my council
bayt as the king pleas said saduko still appar unmov by
the honour that were be heap upon him
and son of matiwan went on panda you ar still unmarri ar you
not
now for the first time saduko face chang ye black on he
said hurriedli but
here he caught my ey and read some warn in it wa silent
but repeat panda after him doubtless you would like to be well
it is natur in a young man who wish to found a hous and therefor
i give you leav to marri
yebo silo ye o wild beast i thank the king but
here i sneez loudli and he ceas
but repeat panda of cours you do not know where to find a wife
between the time the hawk stoop and the rat squeak in it claw how
should you who have never thought of the matter also he continu
with a smile it is well that you have not thought of it sinc she
whom i shall give to you could not live in the second hut in your kraal
and call anoth inkosikazi that is head ladi or chieftai
umbelazi my son go fetch her of whom we have thought as a bride for
thi boi
now umbelazi rose and went with a broad smile upon hi face while
panda somewhat fatigu with all hi speechmakingfor he wa veri
fat and the dai wa veri hotlean hi head back against the hut and
close hi ey
o black on o thou who consumeth with rage dhlangamandhla broke
out saduko who i could see wa much disturb i have someth to
sai to you
no doubt no doubt answer panda drowsili but save up your thank
till you have seen or you will have none left afterward and he
snore slightli
now i perceiv that saduko wa about to ruin himself thought it well
to interfer though what busi of mine it wa to do so i cannot sai
at ani rate if onli i had held my tongu at thi moment and allow
saduko to make a fool of himself as he wish to dofor where mameena
wa concern he never could be wisei verili believ that all the
histori of zululand would have run a differ cours and that mani
thousand of men white and black who ar now dead would be aliv
todai but fate order it otherwis ye it wa not i who spoke but
fate the angel of doom us my throat as hi trumpet
see that panda doze i slip behind saduko and grip him by the
arm
ar you mad i whisper into hi ear will you throw awai your
fortun and your life also
but mameena he whisper back i would marri none save mameena
fool i answer mameena ha betrai and spat upon you take what
the heaven send you and give thank would you wear masapo soil
blanket
macumazahn he said in a hollow voic i will follow your head and
not my own heart yet you sow a strang seed macumazahn or so you mai
think when you see it fruit and he gave me a wild looka look that
frighten me
there wa someth in thi look which caus me to reflect that i might
do well to go awai and leav saduko mameena nandi and the rest of
them to dree their weird as the scotch sai for after all what wa
my finger do in that veri hot stew get burnt i thought and not
collect ani stew
yet look back on these event how could i forese what would be the
end of the mad of saduko of the fear machin of mameena
and of the weak of umbelazi when she snare him in the net of her
beauti thu bring about hi ruin through the hate of saduko and the
ambit of cetewayo how could i know that at the back of all these
event stood the old dwarf zikali the wise work night and dai
to slake the enmiti and fulfil the vengeanc which long ago he had
conceiv and plan against the royal hous of senzangakona and the
zulu peopl over whom it rule
ye he stood there like a man behind a great stone upon the brow of
a mountain slowli remorselessli with infinit skill labour and
patienc push that stone to the edg of the cliff whenc at length
in the appoint hour it would thunder down upon those who dwelt
beneath to leav them crush and no more a peopl how could i guess
that we the actor in thi plai were all the while help him to push
that stone and that he care noth how mani of us were carri with
it into the abyss if onli we brought about the triumph of hi secret
unutter rage and hate
now i see and understand all these thing as it is easi to do but then
i wa blind nor did the voic reach my dull ear to warn me as how
or why i cannot tell thei did i believ reach those of zikali
oh what wa the sum of it just thi i think and noth morethat
as saduko and the other were mameena tool and as all of them and
their passion were zikali tool so he himself wa the tool of some
unseen power that us him and us to accomplish it design which i
suppos is fatal or in other word all these thing happen
becaus thei must happen a poor conclus to reach after so much
thought and strive and not complimentari to man and hi boast
power of free will still on to which mani of us ar often driven
especi if we have live among savag where such drama work
themselv out openli and swiftli unhidden from our ey by the veil
and subterfug of civilis at least there is thi comfort
about itthat if we ar but feather blown by the wind how can the
individu feather be blame becaus it did not travel against turn or
keep back the wind
well let me return from these specul to the histori of the fact
that caus them
just asa littl too latei had made up my mind that i would go after
my own busi and leav saduko to manag hi through the fenc
gatewai appear the great tall umbelazi lead by the hand a woman
as i saw in a moment it did not need certain bangl of copper
ornament of ivori and of veri rare pink bead call infibinga which
onli those of the royal hous were permit to wear to proclaim her
a person of rank for digniti and high blood were appar in her face
her carriag her gestur and all that had to do with her
nandi the sweet wa not a great beauti as wa mameena although
her figur wa fine and her statur like that of all the race of
senzangakonaconsider abov the averag to begin with she wa
darker in hue and her lip were rather thick as wa her nose nor were
her ey larg and liquid like those of an antelop further she lack
the inform mysteri of mameena face that at time wa broken and
lit up by flash of allur light and quick sympathet percept
as a heavi even sky that seem to join the dim earth to the dimmer
heaven is illumin by puls of fire soft and manyhu
suggest but not reveal the strength and splendour that it veil
nandi had none of these attract which after all anywher upon
the earth belong onli to a few women in each gener she wa a
simpl honestnatur kindli affection young woman of high birth
no more that is as these qualiti ar understood and express among
her peopl
umbelazi led her forward into the presenc of the king to whom she
bow gracefulli enough then after cast a swift sidelong glanc at
saduko which i found it difficult to interpret and anoth of inquiri
at me she fold her hand upon her breast and stood silent with bent
head wait to be address
the address wa brief enough for panda wa still sleepi
my daughter he said with a yawn there stand your husband and
he jerk hi thumb toward saduko he is a young man and a brave and
unmarri also on who should grow great in the shadow of our hous
especi as he is a friend of your brother umbelazi i understand
also that you have seen him and like him unless you have anyth to
sai against it for as not be a common father the king receiv no
cattleat least in thi casei am not prejud but will listen to
your word and he chuckl in a drowsi fashion i propos that
the marriag should take place tomorrow now my daughter have you
anyth to sai for if so pleas sai it at onc as i am tire the
etern wrangl between your brethren cetewayo and umbelazi have
worn me out
now nandi look about her in her open honest fashion her gaze
rest first on saduko then on umbelazi and lastli upon me
my father she said at length in her soft steadi voic tell me i
beseech you who propos thi marriag is it the chief saduko is it
the princ umbelazi or is it the white lord whose true name i do not
know but who is call macumazahn watcherbynight
i cant rememb which of them propos it yawn panda who can
keep on talk about thing from night till morn at ani rate i
propos it and i will make your husband a big man among our peopl
have you anyth to sai against it
i have noth to sai my father i have met saduko and like him
wellfor the rest you ar the judg but she ad slowli doe
saduko like me when he speak my name doe he feel it here and she
point to her throat
i am sure i do not know what he feel in hi throat panda repli
testili but i feel that mine is dry well as no on sai anyth
the matter is settl tomorrow saduko shall give the umqoliso the
ox of the girl that make marriageif he ha not got on here i will
lend it to him and you can take the new big hut that i have built in
the outer kraal to dwell in for the present there will be a danc if
you wish it if not i do not care for i have no wish for ceremoni just
now who am too troubl with great matter now i am go to sleep
then sink from hi stool on to hi knee panda crawl through the
doorwai of hi great hut which wa close to him and vanish
umbelazi and i depart also through the gatewai of the fenc leav
saduko and the princess nandi alon togeth for there were no
attend present what happen between them i am sure i do not
know but i gather that in on wai or anoth saduko made himself
suffici agreeabl to the princess to persuad her to take him to
husband perhap be alreadi enamour of him she wa not difficult
to persuad at ani rate on the morrow without ani great feast or
fuss except the customari danc the umqoliso the ox of the girl
wa slaughter and saduko becam the husband of a royal maiden of the
hous of senzangakona
certainli as i rememb reflect it wa a remark rise in life
for on who but a few month befor had been without possess or a
home
i mai add that after our brief talk in the king kraal while panda
wa doze i had no further word with saduko on thi matter of hi
marriag for between it propos and the event he avoid me nor did
i seek him out on the dai of the marriag also i trek for natal
and for a whole year heard no more of saduko nandi and mameena
although to be frank i must admit i thought of the last of these
person more often perhap than i should have done
the truth is that mameena wa on of those women who stick in a man
mind even more close than a waitabit thorn doe in hi coat
chapter ix allan return to zululand
a whole year had gone by in which i did or tri to do variou thing
that have no connect with thi stori when onc more i found
myself in zululandat umbezi kraal inde hither i had trek in
fulfil of a certain bargain alreadi allud to that wa concern
with ivori and gun which i had made with the old fellow or rather
with masapo hi soninlaw whom he repres in thi matter into
the exact circumst of that bargain i do not enter sinc at the
moment i cannot recal whether i ever obtain the necessari permit
to import those gun into zululand although now that i am older i
earnestli hope that i did so sinc it is wrong to sell weapon to
nativ that mai be put to all sort of unforeseen us
at ani rate there i wa sit alon with the headman in hi hut
discuss a dram of squarefac that i had given to him for the
trade wa finish to our mutual satisfact and scowl my bodi
servant with the hunter had just carri off the ivorya fine lot of
tusksto my wagon
well umbezi i said and how ha it fare with you sinc we part a
year ago have you seen anyth of saduko who you mai rememb left
you in some wrath
thank be to my spirit i have seen noth of that wild man
macumazahn answer umbezi shake hi fat old head in a fashion
which show great anxieti yet i have heard of him for he sent me a
messag the other dai to tell me that he had not forgotten what he ow
me
did he mean the stick with which he promis to brai you like a green
hide i inquir innoc
i think so macumazahni think so for certainli he ow me noth
els and the worst of it is that there at panda kraal he ha grown
like a pumpkin on a dung heapgreat great
and therefor is now on who can pai ani debt that he ow umbezi i
said take a pull at the squarefac and look at him over the top
of the pannikin
doubtless he can macumazahn and between you and me that is the real
reason why ior rather masapowa so anxiou to get those gun thei
were not for hunt as he told you by the messeng or for war but
to protect us against saduko in case he should attack well now i hope
we shall be abl to hold our own
you and masapo must teach your peopl to us them first umbezi but
i expect saduko ha forgotten all about both of you now that he is the
husband of a princess of the royal blood tell me how goe it with
mameena
oh well well macumazahn for is she not the head ladi of the
amasomi there is noth wrong with hernoth at all except that as
yet she ha no child also that and he paus
that what i ask
that she hate the veri sight of her husband masapo and sai that
she would rather be marri to a baboony to a baboonthan to him
which give him offenc after he ha paid so mani cattl for her
but what of thi macumazahn there is alwai a grain miss upon
the finest head of corn noth is quit perfect in the world
macumazahn and if mameena doe not chanc to love her husband and he
shrug hi shoulder and drank some squarefac
of cours it doe not matter in the least umbezi except to mameena
and her husband who no doubt will settl down in time now that saduko
is marri to a princess of the zulu hous
i hope so macumazahn but to tell the truth i wish you had brought
more gun for i live amongst a terribl lot of peopl masapo who is
furiou with mameena becaus she will have none of him and therefor
with me as though i could control mameena mameena who is mad with
masapo and therefor with me becaus i gave her in marriag to him
saduko who foam at the mouth at the name of masapo becaus he ha
marri mameena whom it is said he still love and therefor at me
becaus i am her father and did my best to settl her in the world oh
give me some more of that firewat macumazahn for it make me forget
all these thing and especi that my guardian spirit made me the
father of mameena with whom you would not run awai when you might have
done so oh macumazahn why did you not run awai with mameena and turn
her into a quiet white woman who ti herself up in sack sing song
to the greatgreat in the skythat is hymn to the power abov
usand never think of ani man who is not her husband
becaus if i had done so umbezi i should have ceas to be a quiet
white man ye ye my friend i should have been in some such place as
your todai and that is the last thing that i wish and now umbezi
you have had quit enough squarefac so i will take the bottl awai
with me goodnight
on the follow morn i trek veri earli from umbezi
kraalbefor he wa up inde for the squarefac made him sleep
sound my destin wa nodwengu panda great place where i hope
to do some trade but as i wa in no particular hurri my plan wa
to go round by masapo and see for myself how it fare between him and
mameena inde i reach the border of the amasomi territori whereof
masapo wa chief by even and camp there but with the night came
reflect and reflect told me that i should do well to keep clear
of mameena and her domest complic if she had ani so i chang
my mind and next morn trek on to nodwengu by the onli rout
that my guid report to be practic on which took me a long wai
round
that dai ow to the rough of the roadif road it could be
calledand an accid to on of the wagon we onli cover about
fifteen mile and as night fell were oblig to outspan at the first
spot where we could find water when the oxen had been unyok i
look about me and saw that we were in a place that although i had
approach it from a somewhat differ direct i recognis at onc
as the mouth of the black kloof in which over a year befor i had
interview zikali the littl and wise there wa no mistak the
spot that blast vallei with the piledup column of boulder and the
overhang cliff at the end of it have so far as i am awar no exact
counterpart in africa
i sat upon the box of the first wagon eat my food which consist
of some biltong and biscuit for i had not bother to shoot ani game
that dai which wa veri hot and wonder whether zikali were still
aliv also whether i should take the troubl to walk up the kloof and
find out on the whole i thought that i would not as the place repel
me and i did not particularli wish to hear ani more of hi propheci
and fierc illomen talk so i just sat there studi the wonder
effect of the red even light pour up between those wall of
fantast rock
present i perceiv far awai a singl human figurewheth it were
man or woman i could not tellwalk toward me along the path which
ran at the bottom of the cleft in those gigant surround it
look extraordinarili small and lone although perhap becaus of the
intens red light in which it wa bath or perhap just becaus it
wa human a live thing in the midst of all that still inanim
grandeur it caught and focus my attent i grew greatli interest
in it i wonder if it were that of man or woman and what it wa do
here in thi haunt vallei
the figur drew nearer and now i saw it wa slender and tall like that
of a lad or of a wellgrown woman but to which sex it belong i could
not see becaus it wa drape in a cloak of beauti grei fur just
then scowl came to the other side of the wagon to speak to me about
someth which took off my attent for the next two minut when i
look round again it wa to see the figur stand within three yard
of me it face hidden by a kind of hood which wa attach to the fur
cloak
who ar you and what is your busi i ask whereon a gentl
voic answer
do you not know me o macumazana
how can i know on who is ti up like a gourd in a mat yet is it
noti it not
ye it is mameena and i am veri pleas that you should rememb my
voic macumazahn after we have been separ for such a long long
time and with a sudden movement she threw back the kaross hood and
all reveal herself in all her strang beauti
i jump down off the wagonbox and took her hand
o macumazana she said while i still held itor to be accur
while she still held mineinde my heart is glad to see a friend
again and she look at me with her appeal ey which in the red
light i could see appear to float in tear
a friend mameena i exclaim why now you ar so rich and the
wife of a big chief you must have plenti of friend
ala macumazahn i am rich in noth except troubl for my husband
save like the ant for winter why he even grudg me thi poor
kaross and as for friend he is so jealou that he will not allow me
ani
he cannot be jealou of women mameena
oh women piff i do not care for women thei ar veri unkind to me
becausebecausewel perhap you can guess why macumazahn
she answer glanc at her own reflect in a littl travel
lookingglass that hung from the woodwork of the wagon for i had been
us it to brush my hair and smile veri sweetli
at least you have your husband mameena and i thought that perhap by
thi time
she held up her hand
my husband oh i would that i had him not for i hate him macumazahn
and as for the restnev the truth is that i never care for ani man
except on whose name you mai chanc to rememb macumazahn
i suppos you mean saduko i began
tell me macumazahn she inquir innoc ar white peopl veri
stupid i ask becaus you do not seem as clever as you us to be or
have you perhap a bad memori
now i felt myself turn red as the sky behind me and broke in
hurriedli
if you did not like your husband mameena you should not have marri
him you know you need not unless you wish
when on ha onli two thorn bush to sit on macumazahn on choos
that which seem to have the fewest prickl to discov sometim that
thei ar still there in hundr although on did not see them you
know that at length everyon get tire of stand
is that why you have taken to walk mameena i mean what ar you
do here alon
i oh i heard that you were pass thi wai and came to have a talk
with you no from you i cannot hide even the least bit of the truth i
came to talk with you but also i came to see zikali and ask him what a
wife should do who hate her husband
inde and what did he answer you
he answer that he thought she had better run awai with anoth man
if there were on whom she did not hateout of zululand of cours
she repli look first at me and then at my wagon and the two hors
that were ti to it
is that all he said mameena
no have i not told you that i cannot hide on grain of the truth from
you he ad that the onli other thing to be done wa to sit still and
drink my sour milk pretend that it is sweet until my spirit give
me a new cow he seem to think that my spirit would be bounti in
the matter of new cowson dai
anyth more i inquir
on littl thing have i not told you that you shall have allal the
truth zikali seem to think also that at last everi on of my herd of
cow old and new would come to a bad end he did not tell me to what
end
she turn her head asid and when she look up again i saw that she
wa weep realli weep thi time not just make her ey swim as
she did befor
of cours thei will come to a bad end macumazahn she went on in a
soft thick voic for i and all with whom i have to do were torn out
of the reed ie creat that wai and that why i wont tempt you
to run awai with me ani more as i meant to do when i saw you becaus
it is true macumazahn you ar the onli man i ever like or ever
shall like and you know i could make you run awai with me if i chose
although i am black and you ar whiteoh ye befor tomorrow
morn but i wont do it for why should i catch you in my unlucki web
and bring you into all sort of troubl among my peopl and your own go

now give me a cup of water and let me be awaya cup of water no more
oh do not be afraid for me or melt too much lest i should melt also

water macumazahn and good night doubtless we shall meet again er
long and i forgot the littl wise on said he would like to have a
talk with you good night macumazahn good night i trust that you did
a profit trade with umbezi my father and masapo my husband i wonder
why such men as these should have been chosen to be my father and my
husband think it over macumazahn and tell me when next we meet give
me that pretti mirror macumazahn when i look in it i shall see you
as well as myself and that will pleas meyou dont know how much i
thank you good night
in anoth minut i wa watch her solitari littl figur now wrap
again in the hood kaross as it vanish over the brow of the rise
behind us and realli as she went i felt a lump rise in my throat
notwithstand all her wickednessand i suppos she wa wickedther
wa someth horribl attract about mameena
when she had gone take my onli lookingglass with her and the lump
in my throat had gone also i began to wonder how much fact there wa in
her stori she had protest so earnestli that she told me all the truth
that i felt sure there must be someth left behind also i rememb
she had said zikali want to see me well the end of it wa i took a
moonlight walk up that dread gorg into which not even scowl would
accompani me becaus he declar that the place wa well known to be
haunt by imikovu or spectr who have been rais from the dead by
wizard
it wa a long and disagre walk and somehow i felt veri depress
and insignific as i trudg on between those gigant cliff pass
now through patch of bright moonlight and now through deep pool of
shadow thread my wai among clump of bush or round the base of tall
pillar of piledup stone till at length i came to the overhang
cliff at the end which frown down on me like the brow of some
titan demon
well i got to the end at last and at the gate of the kraal fenc wa
met by on of those fierc and huge men who serv the dwarf as guard
suddenli he emerg from behind a stone and have scan me for
a moment in silenc beckon to me to follow him as though i were
expect a minut later i found myself face to face with zikali who
wa seat in the clear moonlight just outsid the shadow of hi hut
and engag appar in hi favourit occup of carv wood
with a rough nativ knife of curiou shape
for a while he took no notic of me then suddenli look up shake
back hi braid grei lock and broke into on of hi great laugh
so it is you macumazahn he said well i knew you were pass my
wai and that mameena would send you here but why do you come to see the
thingthatshouldnothavebeenborn to tell me how you fare with
the buffalo with the split horn eh
no zikali for why should i tell you what you know alreadi mameena
said you wish to talk with me that wa all
then mameena li he answer as is her natur in whose throat
live four fals word for everi on of truth still sit down
macumazahn there is beer made readi for you by that stool and give me
the knife and a pinch of the white man snuff that you have brought for
me as a present
i produc these articl though how he knew that i had them with me
i cannot tell nor did i think it worth while to inquir the snuff i
rememb pleas him veri much but of the knife he said that it wa
a pretti toi but he would not know how to us it then we fell to
talk
what wa mameena do here i ask boldli
what wa she do at your wagon he ask oh do not stop to tell
me i know i know that is a veri good snake of your macumazahn
which alwai just let you slip through her finger when if she
chose to close her hand well well i do not betrai the secret of
my client but i sai thi to yougo on to the kraal of the son of
senzangakona and you will see thing happen that will make you laugh
for mameena will be there and the mongrel masapo her husband truli
she hate him well and after all i would rather be love than hate
by mameena though both ar danger poor mongrel soon the jackal
will be chew hi bone
why do you sai that i ask
onli becaus mameena tell me that he is a great wizard and the
jackal eat mani wizard in zululand also he is an enemi of panda
hous is he not
you have been give her some bad counsel zikali i said blurt
out the thought in my mind
perhap perhap macumazahn onli i mai call it good counsel i have
my own road to walk and if i can find some to clear awai the thorn
that would prick my feet what of it also she will get her pai who
find life dull up there among the amasomi with on she hate for a
hutfellow go you and watch and afterward when you have an hour to
spare come and tell me what happensthat is if i do not chanc to be
there to see for myself

now it will be observ that there wa noth veri remark in thi
convers between zikali and myself he did not tell me ani deep
secret or make ani great propheci it mai be wonder inde when
there is so much to record why i set it down at all
my answer is becaus of the extraordinari impress that it produc
upon me although so littl wa said i felt all the while that those
few word were a veil hide terribl event to be i wa sure that
some dread scheme had been hatch between the old dwarf and mameena
whereof the issu would soon becom appar and that he had sent me
awai in a hurri after he learn that she had told me noth becaus
he fear lest i should stumbl on it cue and perhap caus it to fail
at ani rate as i walk back to my wagon by moonlight down that
dread gorg the hot thick air seem to me to have a physic tast
and smell of blood and the dank foliag of the tropic tree that grew
there when now and again a puff of wind stir them moan like the
fabl imikovu or as men might do in their last faint agoni the effect
upon my nerv wa quit strang for when at last i reach my wagon i
wa shake like a reed and a cold perspir unnatur enough upon
that hot night pour from my face and bodi
well i took a coupl of stiff tot of squarefac to pull myself
togeth and at length went to sleep to awak befor dawn with a
headach look out of the wagon to my surpris i saw scowl and the
hunter who should have been snore stand in a group and talk
to each other in frighten whisper i call scowl to me and ask
what wa the matter
noth baa he said with a shamefac air onli there ar so mani
spook about thi place thei have been pass in and out of it all
night
spook you idiot i answer probabl thei were peopl go to
visit the nyanga zikali
perhap baa onli then we do not know why thei should all look like
dead peopleprinc some of them by their dressand walk upon the
air a man height from the ground
pooh i repli do you not know the differ between owl in the
mist and dead king make readi for we trek at onc the air here is
full of fever
certainli baa he said spring off to obei and i do not think i
ever rememb two wagon be got under wai quicker than thei were that
morn
i mere mention thi nonsens to show that the black kloof could affect
other peopl nerv as well as my own
in due cours i reach nodwengu without accid have sent forward
on of my hunter to report my approach to panda when my wagon arriv
outsid the great place thei were met by none other than my old friend
maputa he who had brought me back the pill befor our attack upon
bangu
greet macumazahn he said i am sent by the king to sai that you
ar welcom and to point you out a good place to outspan also to give
you permiss to trade as much as you will in thi town sinc he know
that your deal ar alwai fair
i return my thank in the usual fashion ad that i had brought a
littl present for the king which i would deliv when it pleas him
to receiv me then i invit maputa to whom i also offer some trifl
which delight him veri much to ride with me on the wagonbox till we
came to the select outspan
thi by the wai prove to be a veri good place inde a littl
vallei full of grass for the cattlefor by the king order it had not
been grazedwith a stream of beauti water run down it moreov
it overlook a great open space immedi in front of the main gate
of the town so that i could see everyth that went on and all who
arriv or depart
you will be comfort here macumazahn said maputa dure your
stai which we hope will be long sinc although there will soon be
a mighti crowd at nodwengu the king ha given order that none except
your own servant ar to enter thi vallei
i thank the king but why will there be a crowd maputa
oh he answer with a shrug of the shoulder becaus of a new
thing all the tribe of the zulu ar to come up to be review
some sai that cetewayo ha brought thi about and some sai that it is
umbelazi but i am sure that it is the work of neither of these but of
saduko your old friend though what hi object is i cannot tell you
i onli trust he ad uneasili that it will not end in bloodsh
between the great brother
so saduko ha grown tall maputa
tall as a tree macumazahn hi whisper in the king ear is louder
than the shout of other moreov he ha becom a selfeat that
is a zulu term which mean on who is veri haughti you will have to
wait on him macumazahn he will not wait on you
is it so i answer well tall tree ar blown down sometim
he nod hi wise old head ye macumazahn i have seen plenti grow
and fall in my time for at last the swimmer goe with the stream
anyhow you will be abl to do a good trade among so mani and whatev
happen none will harm you whom all love and now farewel i bear your
messag to the king who send an ox for you to kill lest you should
grow hungri in hi hous
that same even i saw saduko and the other as i shall tell i had
been up to visit the king and give him my present a case of english
tablekn with bone handl which pleas him greatli although
he did not in the least know how to us them inde without their
accompani fork these ar somewhat futil articl i found the old
fellow veri tire and anxiou but as he wa surround by induna i
had no privat talk with him see that he wa busi i took my leav
as soon as i could and when i walk awai whom should i meet but
saduko
i saw him while he wa a good wai off advanc toward the inner gate
with a train of attend like a royal personag and knew veri well
that he saw me make up my mind what to do at onc i walk straight
on to him forc him to give me the path which he did not wish to
do befor so mani peopl and brush past him as though he were a
stranger as i expect thi treatment had the desir effect for
after we had pass each other he turn and said
do you not know me macumazahn
who call i ask why friend your face is familiar to me how ar
you name
have you forgotten saduko he said in a pain voic
no no of cours not i answer i know you now although you seem
somewhat chang sinc we went out hunt and fight togetheri
suppos becaus you ar fatter i trust that you ar well saduko
goodby i must be go back to my wagon if you wish to see me you
will find me there
these remark i mai add seem to take saduko veri much aback at ani
rate he found no repli to them even when old maputa with whom i wa
walk and some other snigger aloud there is noth that zulu
enjoi so much as see on whom thei consid an upstart set in hi
place
well a coupl of hour afterward just as the sun wa sink who
should walk up to my wagon but saduko himself accompani by a woman
whom i recognis at onc as hi wife the princess nandi who carri
a fine babi boi in her arm rise i salut nandi and offer her my
campstool which she look at suspici and declin prefer to
seat herself on the ground after the nativ fashion so i took it back
again and after i had sat down on it not befor stretch out my hand
to saduko who by thi time wa quit humbl and polit
well we talk awai and by degre without seem too much
interest in them i wa furnish with a list of all the advanc
which it had pleas panda to heap upon saduko dure the past year in
their wai thei were remark enough for it wa much as though some
penniless countri gentleman in england had been promot in that short
space of time to be on of the premier peer of the kingdom and endow
with great offic and estat when he had finish the count of them
he paus evid wait for me to congratul him but all i said
wa
by the heaven abov i am sorri for you saduko how mani enemi
you must have made what a long wai there will be for you to fall on
nighta remark at which the quiet nandi broke into a low laugh that
i think pleas her husband even less than my sarcasm well i went
on i see that you have got a babi which is much better than all these
titl mai i look at it inkosazana
of cours she wa delight and we proceed to inspect the babi
which evid she love more than anyth on earth whilst we were
examin the child and chat about it saduko sit by meanwhil
in the sulk who on earth should appear but mameena and her fat and
sullenlook husband the chief masapo
oh macumazahn she said appear to notic no on els how
pleas i am to see you after a whole long year
i stare at her and my jaw drop then i recov myself think
she must have made a mistak and meant to sai week
twelv moon she went on and macumazahn not on of them ha gone
by but i have thought of you sever time and wonder if we should
ever meet again where have you been all thi while
in mani place i answer amongst other at the black kloof where
i call upon the dwarf zikali and lost my lookingglass
the nyanga zikali oh how often have i wish to see him but of
cours i cannot for i am told he will not receiv ani women
i dont know i am sure i repli but you might try perhap he
would make an except in your favour
i think i will macumazahn she murmur whereon i collaps into
silenc feel that thing were get beyond me
when i recov myself a littl it wa to hear mameena greet saduko
with much effus and compliment him on hi rise in life which
she said she had alwai foreseen thi remark seem to bowl out saduko
also for he made no answer to it although i notic that he could
not take hi ey off mameena beauti face present howev
he seem to becom awar of masapo and instantli hi whole demeanour
chang for it grew proud and even terribl masapo tender him some
greet whereon saduko turn upon him and said
what chief of the amasomi do you give the gooddai to an umfokazana
and a mangi hyena why do you do thi is it becaus the low umfokazana
ha becom a nobl and the mangi hyena ha put on a tiger coat and
he glare at him like a verit tiger
masapo made no answer that i could catch mutter some inaud
word he turn to depart and in do soquit innoc i
thinkstruck nandi knock her over on to her back and caus
the child to fall out of her arm in such fashion that it tender head
struck against a pebbl with suffici forc to caus it to bleed
saduko leapt at him smite him across the shoulder with the littl
stick that he carri for a moment masapo paus and i thought that
he wa go to show fight if he had ani such intent howev he
chang hi mind for without a word or show ani resent at the
insult which he had receiv he broke into a heavi run and vanish
among the even shadow mameena who had observ all broke into
someth els name a laugh
piff my husband is big yet not brave she said but i do not think
he meant to hurt you woman
do you speak to me wife of masapo ask nandi with gentl digniti
as she gain her feet and pick up the stun child if so my name
and titl ar the inkosazana nandi daughter of the black on and wife
of the lord saduko
your pardon repli mameena humbl for she wa cow at onc i did
not know who you were inkosazana
it is grant wife of masapo macumazahn give me water i prai you
that i mai bath the head of my child
the water wa brought and present when the littl on seem all
right again for it had onli receiv a scratch nandi thank me and
depart to her own hut sai with a smile to her husband as she
pass that there wa no need for him to accompani her as she had
servant wait at the kraal gate so saduko stai behind and mameena
stai also he talk with me for quit a long while for he had much
to tell me although all the time i felt that hi heart wa not in hi
talk hi heart wa with mameena who sat there and smile continu
in her mysteri wai onli put in a word now and again as though
to excus her presenc
at length she rose and said with a sigh that she must be go back to
where the amasomi were in camp as masapo would need her to see to hi
food by now it wa quit dark although i rememb that from time to
time the sky wa lit up by sheet lightn for a storm wa brew as
i expect saduko rose also sai that he would see me on the morrow
and went awai with mameena walk like on who dream
a few minut later i had occas to leav the wagon in order to
inspect on of the oxen which wa ti up by itself at a distanc
becaus it had shown sign of some sick that might or might not be
catch move quietli as i alwai do from a hunter habit i walk
alon to the place where the beast wa tether behind some mimosa
thorn just as i reach these thorn the broad lightn shone out
vividli and show me saduko hold the unresist shape of mameena
in hi arm and kiss her passion
then i turn and went back to the wagon even more quietli than i had
come
i should add that on the morrow i found out that after all there wa
noth seriou the matter with my ox
chapter x the smellingout
after these event matter went on quietli for some time i visit
saduko hutsveri fine hutsabout the door of which sat quit a
number of hi tribesmen who seem glad to see me again here i learn
from the ladi nandi that her babe whom she love dearli wa none the
wors for it littl accid also i learn from saduko himself who
came in befor i left attend like a princ by sever notabl men
that he had made up hi quarrel with masapo and inde apologis to
him as he found that he had not realli meant to insult the princess
hi wife have onli thrust her over by accid saduko ad inde
that now thei were good friend which wa well for masapo a man whom
the king had no caus to like i said that i wa glad to hear it and
went on to call upon masapo who receiv me with enthusiasm as also
did mameena
here i note with pleasur that thi pair seem to be on much better
term than i understood had been the case in the past for mameena even
address her husband on two separ occas in veri affection
languag and fetch someth that he want without wait to be
ask masapo too wa in excel spirit becaus as he told me
the old quarrel between him and saduko wa thoroughli made up their
reconcili have been seal by an interchang of gift he ad
that he wa veri glad that thi wa the case sinc saduko wa now on
of the most power men in the countri who could harm him much if he
chose especi as some secret enemi had put it about of late that he
masapo wa an enemi of the king hous and an evildo who practis
witchcraft in proof of hi new friendship howev saduko had promis
that these slander should be look into and their origin punish
if he or she could be found
well i congratul him and took my departur think furious
as the frenchman sai that there wa a tragedi pend i wa sure
thi weather wa too calm to last the water ran so still becaus it wa
prepar to leap down some hidden precipic
yet what could i do tell masapo i had seen hi wife be embrac by
anoth man sure that wa not my busi it wa masapo busi
to attend to her conduct also thei would both deni it and i had no
wit tell him that saduko reconcili with him wa not sincer
and that he had better look to himself how did i know it wa not
sincer it might suit saduko book to make friend with masapo and
if i interf i should onli make enemi and be call a liar who wa
work for some secret end
go to panda and confid my suspicion to him he wa far too anxiou
and busi about great matter to listen to me and if he did would onli
laugh at thi tale of a petti flirtat no there wa noth to be
done except sit still and wait veri possibl i wa mistaken after all
and thing would smooth themselv out as thei gener do
meanwhil the review or whatev it mai have been wa in
progress and i wa busi with my own affair make hai while the sun
shone so great were the crowd of peopl who came up to nodwengu that
in a week i had sold everyth i had to sell in the two wagon that
were mostli laden with cloth bead knive and so forth moreov the
price i got were splendid sinc the buyer bid against each other and
befor i wa clear out i had collect quit a herd of cattl also
a quantiti of ivori these i sent on to natal with on of the wagon
remain behind myself with the other partli becaus panda ask me
to do sofor now and again he would seek my advic on sundri
questionsand partli from curios
there wa plenti to be curiou about up at nodwengu just then sinc
no on wa sure that civil war would not break out between the princ
cetewayo and umbelazi whose faction were present in forc
it wa avert for the time howev by umbelazi keep awai from the
great gather under pretext of be sick and leav saduko and some
other to watch hi interest also the rival regiment were not allow
to approach the town at the same time so that public cloud pass over
to the enorm relief of everyon especi of panda the king as to
the privat cloud whereof thi histori tell it wa otherwis
as the tribe came up to the great place thei were review and sent
awai sinc it wa imposs to feed so vast a multitud as would have
collect had thei all remain thu the amasomi a small peopl who
were amongst the first to arriv soon left onli for some reason which
i never quit understood masapo mameena and a few of masapo children
and headmen were detain there though perhap if she had chosen
mameena could have given an explan
well thing began to happen sundri personag were taken ill and
some of them di suddenli and soon it wa note that all these peopl
either live near to where masapo famili wa lodg or had at some
time or other been on bad term with him thu saduko himself wa taken
ill or said he wa at ani rate he vanish from public gaze for three
dai and reappear look veri sorri for himself though i could not
observ that he had lost strength or weight these catastroph i pass
over howev in order to come to the greatest of them which is on of
the turn point of thi chronicl
after recov from hi alleg sick saduko gave a kind of
thanksgiv feast at which sever oxen were kill i wa present at
thi feast or rather at the last part of it for i onli put in what mai
be call a complimentari appear have no tast for such nativ
gorg as it drew near it close saduko sent for nandi who at
first refus to come as there were no women presenti think becaus he
wish to show hi friend that he had a princess of the royal blood
for hi wife who had born him a son that on dai would be great in the
land for saduko as i have said had becom a selfeat and thi
dai hi pride wa inflam by the adul of the compani and by the
beer that he had drunk
at length nandi did come carri her babe from which she never would
be part in her dignifi ladylik fashion although it seem an odd
term to appli to a savag i know none that describ her better she
greet first me and then sundri of the other guest sai a few word
to each of them at length she came opposit to masapo who had dine
not wise but too well and to him out of her natur courtesi spoke
rather longer than to the other inquir after hi wife mameena and
other at the moment it occur to me that she did thi in order to
assur him that she bore no malic becaus of the accid of a while
befor and wa a parti to her husband reconcili with him
masapo in a hazi wai tri to reciproc these kind intent
rise to hi feet hi fat coars bodi swai to and fro becaus of
the beer that he had drunk he express satisfact at the feast that
had been prepar in her hous then hi ey fall on the child he
began to declaim about it size and beauti until he wa stop by the
murmur protest of other sinc among nativ it is held to be not
fortun to prais a young child inde the person who doe so is apt
to be call an umtakati or bewitch who will bring evil upon it
head a word that i heard murmur by sever near to me not satisfi
with thi seriou breach of etiquett the intox masapo snatch
the infant from it mother arm under pretext of look for the hurt
that had been caus to it brow when it fell to the ground at my camp
and find none proceed to kiss it with hi thick lip
nandi drag it from him sai
would you bring death upon my son o chief of the amasomi
then turn she walk awai from the feaster upon whom there fell a
certain hush
fear lest someth unpleas should ensu for i saw saduko bite
hi lip with rage not unmix with fear and rememb masapo
reput as a wizard i took advantag of thi paus to bid a gener
good night to the compani and retir to my camp
what happen immedi after i left i do not know but just befor
dawn on the follow morn i wa awaken from sleep in my wagon by
my servant scowl who said that a messeng had come from the hut of
saduko beg that i would proce there at onc and bring the white
man medicin as hi child wa veri ill of cours i got up and went
take with me some ipecacuanha and a few other remedi that i thought
might be suitabl for infantil ailment
outsid the hut which i reach just as the sun began to rise i wa
met by saduko himself who wa come to seek me as i saw at onc in a
state of terribl grief
what is the matter i ask
o macumazana he answer that dog masapo ha bewitch my boi and
unless you can save him he di
nonsens i said why do you utter wind if the babe is sick it is
from some natur caus
wait till you see it he repli
well i went into the big hut and there found nandi and some other
women also a nativ doctor or two nandi wa seat on the floor
look like a stone imag of grief for she made no sound onli point
with her finger to the infant that lai upon a mat in front of her
a singl glanc show me that it wa dy of some diseas of which
i had no knowledg for it duski littl bodi wa cover with red
blotch and it tini face twist all awri i told the women to heat
water think that possibl thi might be a case of convuls which
a hot bath would mitig but befor it wa readi the poor babe utter
a thin wail and di
then when she saw that her child wa gone nandi spoke for the first
time
the wizard ha done hi work well she said and flung herself face
downward on the floor of the hut
as i did not know what to answer i went out follow by saduko
what ha kill my son macumazahn he ask in a hollow voic the
tear run down hi handsom face for he had love hi firstborn
i cannot tell i repli but had he been older i should have thought
he had eaten someth poison which seem imposs
ye macumazahn and the poison that he ha eaten came from the breath
of a wizard whom you mai chanc to have seen kiss him last night well
hi life shall be aveng
saduko i exclaim do not be unjust there ar mani sick
that mai have kill your son of which i have no knowledg who am not a
train doctor
i will not be unjust macumazahn the babe ha di by witchcraft
like other in thi town of late but the evildo mai not be he whom i
suspect that is for the smellersout to decid and without more word
he turn and left me
next dai masapo wa put upon hi trial befor a court of councillor
over which the king himself presid a veri unusu thing for him to
do and on which show the great interest he took in the case
at thi court i wa summon to give evid and of cours confin
myself to answer such question as were put to me practic these
were but two what had pass at my wagon when masapo had knock over
nandi and her child and saduko had struck him and what had i seen at
saduko feast when masapo had kiss the infant i told them in as few
word as i could and after some slight crossexamin by masapo
made with a view to prove that the upset of nandi wa an accid
and that he wa drunk at saduko feast to both of which suggest i
assent i rose to go panda howev stop me and bade me describ
the aspect of the child when i wa call in to give it medicin
i did so as accur as possibl and could see that my account made
a deep impress on the mind of the court then panda ask me if i had
ever seen ani similar case to which i wa oblig to repli
no i have not
after thi the councillor consult privat and when we were call
back the king gave hi judgment which wa veri brief it wa evid
he said that there had been event which might have caus enmiti to
aris in the mind of masapo against saduko by whom masapo had been
struck with a stick therefor although a reconcili had taken
place there seem to be a possibl motiv for reveng but if masapo
kill the child there wa no evid to show how he had done so
moreov that infant hi own grandson had not di of ani known
diseas he had howev di of a similar diseas to that which had
carri off certain other with whom masapo had been mix up wherea
more includ saduko himself had been sick and recov all of
which seem to make a strong case against masapo
still he and hi councillor wish not to condemn without full proof
that be so thei had determin to call in the servic of some
great witchdoctor on who live at a distanc and knew noth of the
circumst who that doctor should be wa not yet settl when
it wa and he had arriv the case would be reopen and meanwhil
masapo would be kept a close prison final he prai that the white
man macumazahn would remain at hi town until the matter wa settl
so masapo wa led off look veri deject and have salut the
king we all went awai
i should add that except for the remiss of the case to the court
of the witchdoctor which of cours wa an instanc of pure kafir
superstit thi judgment of the king seem to me well reason and
just veri differ inde from what would have been given by dingaan
or chaka who were wont on less evid to make a clean sweep not
onli of the accus but of all hi famili and depend
about eight dai later dure which time i had heard noth of the
matter and seen no on connect with it for the whole thing seem to
have becom zilathat is not to be talk abouti receiv a summon
to attend the smellingout and went wonder what witchdoctor had
been chosen for that bloodi and barbar ceremoni inde i had not
far to go sinc the place select for the occas wa outsid the
fenc of the town of nodwengu on that great open stretch of ground
which lai at the mouth of the vallei where i wa camp here as i
approach i saw a vast multitud of peopl crowd togeth fifti
deep or more round a littl oval space not much larger than the pit
of a theatr on the inmost edg of thi ring were seat mani notabl
peopl male and femal and as i wa conduct to the side of it which
wa nearest to the gate of the town i observ among them saduko
masapo mameena and other and mix up with them a number of soldier
who were evid on duti
scarc had i seat myself on a campstool carri by my servant
scowl when through the gate of the kraal issu panda and certain
of hi council whose appear the multitud greet with the royal
salut of bayt that came from them in a deep and simultan roar
of sound when it echo di awai in the midst of a deep silenc
panda spoke sai

witchtrial begin
there wa a long paus and then in the open gatewai appear a solitari
figur that at first sight seem to be scarc human the figur of
a dwarf with a gigant head from which hung long white hair plait
into lock it wa zikali no other
quit unattend and nake save for hi moocha for he had on him none
of the ordinari paraphernalia of the witchdoctor he waddl forward
with a curiou toadlik gait till he had pass through the councillor
and stood in the open space of the ring halt there he look about
him slowli with hi deepset ey turn as he look till at length
hi glanc fell upon the king

he laugh again in hi illomen fashion and went on hurriedli as
though he fear that he should be call upon to explain hi word
where is the fee where is the fee is the king so poor that he expect
an old dwandw doctor to divin for noth just as though he were
work for a privat friend
panda made a motion with hi hand and ten fine heifer were driven into
the circl from some place where thei had been kept in wait
sorri beast said zikali contemptu compar to those we us
to breed befor the time of senzangakonaa remark which caus a loud
wow of astonish to be utter by the multitud that heard it
still such as thei ar let them be taken to my kraal with a bull

the cattl were driven awai and the ancient dwarf squat himself down
and stare at the ground look like a great black toad for a long
whilequit ten minut i should thinkh stare thu till i for
on watch him intent began to feel as though i were mesmeris

that the dust fell down again over zikali over the king and over three
of hi son who sat behind him those three son i rememb were name
tshonkweni dabulesiny and mantantashiya as it chanc by a strang
coincid all of these were kill at the great battl of the tugela
of which i have to tell
now again an exclam of fear and wonder rose from the audienc who
set down thi lift of the dust at zikali veri feet not to natur
caus but to the power of hi magic moreov those on whom it had
fallen includ the king rose hurriedli and shook and brush it
from their person with a zeal that wa not i think inspir by a mere
desir for cleanli but zikali onli laugh again in hi terribl
fashion and let it lie on hi freshoil bodi which it turn to the
dull dead hue of a grei adder
he rose and step here and there examin the newfallen dust then
he put hi hand into a pouch he wore and produc from it a dri human
finger whereof the nail wa so pink that i think it must have been
coloureda sight at which the circl shudder
be clever he said o finger of her i love best be clever and write
in the dust as yonder macumazana can write and as some of the dwandw
us to write befor we becam slave and bow ourselv down befor
the great heaven by thi he meant the zulu whose name mean
the heaven be clever dear finger which caress me onc me the
thingthatshouldnothavebeenborn as more will think befor i die
and write those matter that it pleas the hous of senzangakona to
know thi dai
then he bent down and with the dead finger at three separ spot made
certain mark in the fallen dust which to me seem to consist of
circl and dot and a strang and horrid sight it wa to see him do
it
i thank you dear finger now sleep sleep your work is done and
slowli he wrap the relic up in some soft materi and restor it to
hi pouch
then he studi the first of the mark and ask what am i here
for what am i here for doe he who sit upon the throne desir to know
how long he ha to reign
now those of the inner circl of the spectat who at these
smellingsout act as a kind of choru look at the king and see
that he shook hi head vigor stretch out their right hand
hold the thumb downward and said simultan in a cold low
voic
izwa that is we hear you
zikali stamp upon thi set of mark
it is well he said he who sit upon the throne doe not desir to
know how long he ha to reign and therefor the dust ha forgotten and
show it not to me
then he walk to the next mark and studi them
doe the child of senzangakona desir to know which of hi son shall
live and which shall die ay and which of them shall sleep in hi hut
when he is gone
now a great roar of izwa accompani by the clap of hand rose
from all the outer multitud who heard for there wa no inform
that the zulu peopl desir so earnestli as thi at the time of which i
write
but again panda who i saw wa thoroughli alarm at the turn thing
were take shook hi head vigor whereon the obedi choru
negativ the question in the same fashion as befor
zikali stamp upon the second set of mark sai
the peopl desir to know but the great on ar afraid to learn and
therefor the dust ha forgotten who in the dai to come shall sleep in
the hut of the king and who shall sleep in the belli of the jackal
and the crop of the vultur after thei have gone beyond by the
bridg of spear
now at thi aw speech which both becaus of all that it impli of
bloodsh and civil war and of the wild wail voic in which it wa
spoken that seem quit differ from zikali caus everyon who
heard it includ myself i am afraid to gasp and shiver the king
sprang from hi stool as though to put a stop to such doctor then
after hi fashion he chang hi mind and sat down again but zikali
take no heed went to the third set of mark and studi them
it would seem he said that i am awaken from sleep in my black
hous yonder to tell of a veri littl matter that might well have been
dealt with by ani common nyanga born but yesterdai well i have taken
my fee and i will earn it although i thought that i wa brought here
to speak of great matter such as the death of princ and the fortun
of peopl is it desir that my spirit should speak of wizardri in
thi town of nodwengu
izwa said the choru in a loud voic
zikali nod hi great head and seem to talk with the dust wait
now and again for an answer
good he said thei ar mani and the dust ha told them all to me
oh thei ar veri manyand he glare around himso mani that if i
spoke them all the hyena of the hill would be full tonight
here the audienc began to show sign of great apprehens
but look down at the dust and turn hi head sidewai what
do you sai what do you sai speak more plainli littl voic for you
know i grow deaf oh now i understand the matter is even smaller than
i thought just of on wizard

izwa veri loudli
ah so we have iton death now wa it a man
izwa veri coldli

then a child it must be a child unless inde it is the death of a
spirit but what do you peopl know of spirit a child a child ah

a wellborn child on who would have been great o dust i hear i
hear a royal child a child in whom ran the blood of the father of the
zulu he who wa my friend the blood of senzangakona the blood of the
black on the blood of panda
he stop while both from the choru and from the thousand of the
circl gather around went up on roar of izwa emphasis by a
mighti movement of outstretch arm and downpoint thumb
then silenc dure which zikali stamp upon all the remain
mark sai
i thank you o dust though i am sorri to have troubl you for so
small a matter so so he went on present a royal boychild
is dead and you think by witchcraft let us find out if he di by
witchcraft or as other die by command of the heaven that need them
what here is on mark which i have left look it grow red it is full
of spot the child di with a twist face
izwa izwa izwa crescendo
thi death wa not natur now wa it witchcraft or wa it poison
both i think both and whose wa the child not that of a son of the
king i think oh ye you hear me peopl you hear me but be silent
i do not need your help no not of a son of a daughter then he
turn and look about him till hi ey fell upon a group of women
amongst whom sat nandi dress like a common person of a daughter
a daughter he walk to the group of women why none of these ar
royal thei ar the children of low peopl and yetand yet i seem to
smell the blood of senzangakona
he snif at the air as a dog doe and as he snif drew ever nearer
to nandi till at last he laugh and point to her
your child princess whose name i do not know your firstborn child
whom you love more than your own heart
she rose
ye ye nyanga she cri i am the princess nandi and he wa my
child whom i love more than my own heart
haha said zikali dust you did not lie to me my spirit you did
not lie to me but now tell me dustand tell me my spiritwho
kill thi child
he began to waddl round the circl an extraordinari sight cover
as he wa with grei grime vari with streak of black skin where the
perspir had wash the dust awai
present he came opposit to me and to my dismai paus snif at
me as he had at nandi
ah ah o macumazana he said you have someth to do with thi
matter a sai at which all that audienc prick their ear
then i rose up in wrath and fear know my posit to be on of some
danger
wizard or smellerout of wizard whichev you name yourself i
call in a loud voic if you mean that i kill nandi child you
lie
no no macumazahn he answer but you tri to save it and
therefor you had someth to do with the matter had you not
moreov i think that you who ar wise like me know who did kill it
wont you tell me macumazahn no then i must find out for myself be
at peac doe not all the land know that your hand ar white as your
heart
then to my great relief he pass on amidst a murmur of approb
for as i have said the zulu like me round and round he wander
to my surpris pass both mameena and masapo without take ani
particular note of them although he scan them both and i thought
that i saw a swift glanc of recognit pass between him and mameena
it wa curiou to watch hi progress for as he went those in front of
him swai in their terror like corn befor a puff of wind and when he
had pass thei straighten themselv as the corn doe when the wind
ha gone by
at length he had finish hi journei and return to hi
startingpoint to all appear complet puzzl
you keep so mani wizard at your kraal king he said address
panda that it is hard to sai which of them wrought thi deed it would
have been easier to tell you of greater matter yet i have taken your
fee and i must earn iti must earn it dust you ar dumb now my
idhlozi my spirit do you speak and hold hi head sidewai
he turn hi left ear up toward the sky then said present in a
curiou matteroffact voic
ah i thank you spirit well king your grandchild wa kill by the
hous of masapo your enemi chief of the amasomi
now a roar of approb went up from the audienc among whom masapo
guilt wa a foregon conclus
when thi had di down panda spoke sai
the hous of masapo is a larg hous i believ that he ha sever
wive and mani children it is not enough to smell out the hous sinc
i am not as those who went befor me were nor will i slai the innoc
with the guilti tell us o openerofroad who among the hous of
masapo ha wrought thi deed
that just the question grumbl zikali in a deep voic all that
i know is that it wa done by poison and i smell the poison it is
here
then he walk to where mameena sat and cri out
seiz that woman and search her hair
execution who were in wait sprang forward but mameena wave them
awai
friend she said with a littl laugh there is no need to touch
me and rise she step forward to the centr of the ring here
with a few swift motion of her hand she flung off first the cloak she
wore then the moocha about her middl and lastli the fillet that bound
her long hair and stood befor that audienc in all her nake beautya
wondrou and a love sight
now she said let women come and search me and my garment and see
if there is ani poison hid there
two old crone step forwardthough i do not know who sent themand
carri out a veri thorough examin final report that thei had
found noth thereon mameena with a shrug of her shoulder resum
such cloth as she wore and return to her place
zikali appear to grow angri he stamp upon the ground with hi big
feet he shook hi braid grei lock and cri out
is my wisdom to be defeat in such a littl matter on of you tie a
bandag over my ey
now a manit wa maputa the messengercam out and did so and i
note that he ti it well and tight zikali whirl round upon hi
heel first on wai and then anoth and cry aloud guid me my
spirit march forward in a zigzag fashion as a blindfold man doe
with hi arm stretch out in front of him first he went to the right
then to the left and then straight forward till at length to my
astonish he came exactli opposit the spot where masapo sat and
stretch out hi great grope hand seiz the kaross with which he
wa cover and with a jerk tore it from him
search thi he cri throw it on the ground and a woman
search
present she utter an exclam and from among the fur of on of
the tail of the kaross produc a tini bag that appear to be made out
of the bladder of a fish thi she hand to zikali whose ey had now
been unbandag
he look at it then gave it to maputa sai
there is the poisonther is the poison but who gave it i do not sai
i am weari let me go
then none hinder him he walk awai through the gate of the kraal
soldier seiz upon masapo while the multitud roar kill the
wizard
masapo sprang up and run to where the king sat flung himself upon
hi knee protest hi innoc and prai for merci i also who
had doubt as to all thi busi ventur to rise and speak
o king i said as on who ha known thi man in the past i plead
with you how that powder came into hi kaross i know not but perchanc
it is not poison onli harmless dust
ye it is but wood dust which i us for the clean of my nail
cri masapo for he wa so terrifi i think he knew not what he said
so you own to knowledg of the medicin exclaim panda therefor
none hid it in your kaross through malic
masapo began to explain but what he said wa lost in a mighti roar of
kill the wizard
panda held up hi hand and there wa silenc
bring milk in a dish command the king and it wa brought and at
a further word from him dust with the powder
now o macumazana said panda to me if you still think that yonder
man is innoc will you drink thi milk
i do not like milk o king i answer shake my head whereon all
who heard me laugh
will mameena hi wife drink it then ask panda
she also shook her head sai

just then a lean white dog on of those homeless mangi beast that
strai about kraal and live upon carrion wander into the ring panda
made a sign and a servant go to where the poor beast stood stare
about it hungrili set down the wooden dish of milk in front of it
instantli the dog lap it up for it wa starv and as it finish
the last drop the man slip a leathern thong about it neck and held
it fast
now all ey were fix upon the dog mine among them present the
beast utter a long and melancholi howl which thrill me through for
i knew it to be masapo death warrant then began to scratch the ground
and foam at the mouth guess what would follow i rose bow to the
king and walk awai to my camp which it will be rememb wa set
up in a littl kloof command thi place at a distanc onli of a few
hundr yard so intent wa all the multitud upon watch the dog

who stai behind told me that it did not die for about ten minut
sinc befor it end a red rash appear upon it similar to that which i
had seen upon saduko child and it wa seiz with convuls
well i reach my tent unmolest and have lit my pipe engag
myself in make busi entri in my notebook in order to divert my
mind as much as i could when suddenli i heard a most devilish clamour
look up i saw masapo run toward me with a speed that i should
have thought imposs in so fat a man while after him race the
fiercefac execution and behind came the mob

masapo reach me he flung himself on hi knee befor me gasp
save me macumazahn i am innoc mameena the witch mameena
he got no farther for the slayer had leapt on him like hound upon a

then i turn and cover up my ey
next morn i left nodwengu without sai goodby to anyon for what
had happen there made me desir a chang my servant scowl and on
of my hunter remain howev to collect some cattl that were still

cattl thei told me that mameena the widow of masapo had enter the
hous of saduko as hi second wife in answer to a question which i put
to them thei ad that it wa said that the princess nandi did
not approv of thi choic of saduko which she thought would not be
fortun for him or bring him happi as her husband seem to be
much enamour of mameena howev she had waiv her object and
when panda ask if she gave her consent had told him that although she
would prefer that saduko should choos some other woman who had not been
mix up with the wizard who kill her child she wa prepar to take
mameena as her sister and would know how to keep her in her place
chapter xi the sin of umbelazi
about eighteen month had gone by and onc again in the autumn of the
year 1856 i found myself at old umbezi kraal where there seem to
be an extraordinari market for ani kind of gaspip that could be call
a gun well as a trader who could not afford to neglect profit
market which ar hard thing to find there i wa
now in eighteen month mani thing becom a littl obscur in on
memori especi if thei have to do with savag in whom after all
on take onli a philosoph and a busi interest therefor i mai
perhap be excus if i had more or less forgotten a good mani of the
detail of what i mai call the mameena affair these howev came back
to me veri vividli when the first person that i metat some distanc
from the kraal where i suppos she had been take a countri walkwa
the beauti mameena herself there she wa look quit unchang
and as love as ever sit under the shade of a wild figtre and
fan herself with a hand of it leav
of cours i jump off my wagonbox and greet her
siyakubona that is good morrow macumazahn she said my heart is
glad to see you
siyakubona mameena i answer leav out all refer to my
heart then i ad look at her is it true that you have a new
husband
ye macumazahn an old lover of mine ha becom a new husband you
know whom i meansaduko after the death of that evildo masapo he
grew veri urgent and the king also the inkosazana nandi press it
on me and so i yield also to be honest saduko wa a good match or
seem to be so
by now we were walk side by side for the train of wagon had gone
ahead to the old outspan so i stop and look her in the face
seem to be i repeat what do you mean by seem to be ar
you not happi thi time
not altogeth macumazahn she answer with a shrug of her
shoulder saduko is veri fond of mefond than i like inde sinc
it caus him to neglect nandi who by the wai ha anoth son and
although she sai littl that make nandi cross in short she ad
with a burst of truth i am the playth nandi is the great ladi
and that place suit me ill
if you love saduko you should not mind mameena
love she said bitterli piff what is love but i have ask you
that question onc befor
why ar you here mameena i inquir leav it unansw
becaus saduko is here and of cours nandi for she never leav
him and he will not leav me becaus the princ umbelazi is come
becaus there ar plot afoot and the great war draw nearthat war in
which so mani must die
between cetewayo and umbelazi mameena
ay between cetewayo and umbelazi why do you suppos those wagon of
your ar load with gun for which so mani cattl must be paid not to
shoot game with i think well thi littl kraal of my father is
just now the headquart of the umbelazi faction the isigqosa as the
princedom of gikazi is that of cetewayo my poor father she ad
with her characterist shrug he think himself veri great todai
as he did after he had shot the elephantbefor i nurs you
macumazahnbut often i wonder what will be the end of itfor him and
for all of us macumazahn includ yourself
i i answer what have i to do with your zulu quarrel
that you will know when you have done with them macumazahn but here
is the kraal and befor we enter it i wish to thank you for try to
protect that unlucki husband of mine masapo
i onli did so mameena becaus i thought him innoc
i know macumazahn and so did i although as i alwai told you i
hate him the man with whom my father forc me to marri but i am
afraid from what i have learn sinc that he wa not altogeth
innoc you see saduko had struck him which he could not forget
also he wa jealou of saduko who had been my suitor and wish to
injur him but what i do not understand she ad with a burst of
confid is why he did not kill saduko instead of hi child
well mameena you mai rememb it wa said he tri to do so
ye macumazahn i had forgotten that i suppos that he did try and
fail oh now i see thing with both ey look yonder is my father
i will go awai but come and talk to me sometim macumazahn for
otherwis nandi will be care that i should hear nothingi who am
the playth the beauti woman of the hous who must sit and smile
but must not think
so she depart and i went on to meet old umbezi who came gambol
toward me like an obes goat reflect that whatev might be the
truth or otherwis of her stori her advanc in the world did not
seem to have brought mameena greater happi and content
umbezi who greet me warmli wa in high spirit and full of
import he inform me that the marriag of mameena to saduko after
the death of the wizard her husband whose tribe and cattl had been
given to saduko in compens for the loss of hi son wa a most
fortun thing for him
i ask why
becaus as saduko grow great so i hi fatherinlaw grow great with
him macumazahn especi as he ha been liber to me in the matter
of cattl pass on to me a share of the herd of masapo so that i
who have been poor so long am get rich at last moreov my kraal
is to be honour with a visit from umbelazi and some of hi brother
tomorrow and saduko ha promis to lift me up high when the princ is
declar heir to the throne
which princ i ask
umbelazi macumazahn who els umbelazi who without doubt will
conquer cetewayo
why without doubt umbezi cetewayo ha a great follow and if he
should conquer i think that you will onli be lift up in the crop of
the vultur
at thi rough suggest umbezi fat face fell
o macumazana he said if i thought that i would go over to
cetewayo although saduko is my soninlaw but it is not possibl
sinc the king love umbelazi mother most of all hi wive and as i
chanc to know ha sworn to her that he favour umbelazi caus sinc
he is the dearest to him of all hi son and will do everyth that
he can to help him even to the send of hi own regiment to hi
assist if there should be need also it is said that zikali
openerofroad who ha all wisdom ha prophesi that umbelazi will
win more than he ever hope for
the king i said a straw blown hither and thither between two great
wind wait to be waft to rest by that which is strongest the
propheci of zikali it seem to me that it can be read two wai if
inde he ever made on well umbezi i hope that you ar right for
although it is no affair of mine who am but a white trader in your
countri i like umbelazi better than cetewayo and think that he ha a
kinder heart also as you have chosen hi side i advis you to stick
to it sinc traitor to a caus seldom come to ani good whether it
win or lose and now will you take count of the gun and powder which
i have brought with me
ah better would it have been for umbezi if he had listen to my advic
and remain faith to the leader he had chosen for then even if he
had lost hi life at least he would have kept hi good name but of him
present as thei sai in pedigre
next dai i went to pai my respect to nandi whom i found engag in
nurs her new babi and as quiet and state in her demeanour as ever
still i think that she wa veri glad to see me becaus i had tri to
save the life of her first child whom she could not forget if for no
other reason whilst i wa talk to her of that sad matter also of
the polit state of the countri as to which i think she wish to
sai someth to me mameena enter the hut without wait to be
ask and sat down whereon nandi becam suddenli silent
thi howev did not troubl mameena who talk awai about anyth
and everyth complet ignor the headwif for a while nandi
bore it with patienc but at length she took advantag of a paus in
the convers to sai in her firm low voic
thi is my hut daughter of umbezi a thing which you rememb well
enough when it is a question whether saduko our husband shall visit
you or me can you not rememb it now when i would speak with the white
chief watcherbynight who ha been so good as to take the troubl to
come to see me
on hear these word mameena leapt up in a rage and i must sai i
never saw her look more love
you insult me daughter of panda as you alwai try to do becaus you
ar jealou of me
your pardon sister repli nandi why should i who am saduko
inkosikazi and as you sai daughter of panda the king be jealou
of the widow of the wizard masapo and the daughter of the headman
umbezi whom it ha pleas our husband to take into hi hous to be the
companion of hi leisur
why becaus you know that saduko love my littl finger more than
he doe your whole bodi although you ar of the king blood and have
born him brat she answer look at the infant with no kindli
ey
it mai be so daughter of umbezi for men have their fanci and
without doubt you ar fair yet i would ask you on thingif saduko
love you so much how come it he trust you so littl that you must
learn ani matter of weight by listen at my door as i found you do
the other dai
becaus you teach him not to do so o nandi becaus you ar ever
tell him not to consult with me sinc she who ha betrai on
husband mai betrai anoth becaus you make him believ my place is
that of hi toi not that of hi companion and thi although i am
clever than you and all your hous ti into on bundl as you mai
find out some dai
ye answer nandi quit undisturb i do teach him these thing
and i am glad that in thi matter saduko ha a think head and listen
to me also i agre that it is like i shall learn mani more ill thing
through and of you on dai daughter of umbezi and now as it is not
good that we should wrangl befor thi white lord again i sai to you
that thi is my hut in which i wish to speak alon with my guest
i go i go gasp mameena but i tell you that saduko shall hear of
thi
certainli he will hear of it for i shall tell him when he come
tonight
anoth instant and mameena wa gone have shot out of the hut like a
rabbit from it burrow
i ask your pardon macumazahn for what ha happen said nandi
but it had becom necessari that i should teach my sister mameena
upon which stool she ought to sit i do not trust her macumazahn i
think that she know more of the death of my child than she choos to
sai she who wish to be rid of masapo for a reason you can guess i
think also she will bring shame and troubl upon saduko whom she
ha bewitch with her beauti as she bewitch all menperhap even
yourself a littl macumazahn and now let us talk of other matter
to thi proposit i agre cordial sinc to tell the truth if i
could have manag to do so with ani decent grace i should have been
out of that hut long befor mameena so we fell to convers on the
condit of zululand and the danger that lai ahead for all who were
connect with the royal housea state of affair which troubl nandi
much for she wa a clearhead woman and on who fear the futur
ah macumazahn she said to me as we part i would that i were the
wife of some man who did not desir to grow great and that no royal
blood ran in my vein
on the next dai the princ umbelazi arriv and with him saduko and
a few other notabl men thei came quit quietli and without ani
ostens escort although scowl my servant told me he heard that
the bush at a littl distanc wa swarm with soldier of the isigqosa
parti if i rememb rightli the excus for the visit wa that umbezi
had some of a certain rare breed of white cattl whereof the princ
wish to secur young bull and heifer to improv hi herd
onc insid the kraal howev umbelazi who wa a veri opennatur
man threw off all pretenc and after greet me heartili enough
told me with plain that he wa there becaus thi wa a conveni
spot on which to arrang the consolid of hi parti

were chief disguisedcam and went i should have like to follow
their examplethat is so far as their departur wa concernedfor
i felt that i wa be drawn into a veri danger vortex but as
a matter of fact i could not escap sinc i wa oblig to wait to
receiv payment for my stuff which as usual wa made in cattl
umbelazi talk with me a good deal at that time impress upon me how
friendli he wa toward the english white men of natal as distinguish
from the boer and what good treatment he wa prepar to promis to
them should he ever attain to author in zululand it wa dure on
of the earliest of these convers which of cours i saw had an
ultim object that he met mameena i think for the first time
we were walk togeth in a littl natur glade of the bush that
border on side of the kraal when at the end of it look like
some wood nymph of classic fabl in the light of the set sun

head a gourd
umbelazi note her at onc and ceas hi polit talk of which he

scarc i mai add that mameena must have had a great deal to tell
umbelazi fulli an hour and a half had gone by befor by the light of
the moon from a point of vantag on my wagonbox whenc accord to
my custom i wa keep a lookout on thing in gener i saw her slip
back to the kraal silent as a snake follow at a littl distanc by
the tower form of umbelazi
appar mameena continu to be the recipi of inform which
she found it necessari to commun in privat to the princ at ani
rate on sundri subsequ even the dull of my vigil on the
wagonbox wa reliev by the sight of her grace figur glide home
from the kloof that umbelazi seem to find a veri suitabl spot
for reflect after sunset on on of the last of these occas i
rememb that nandi chanc to be with me have come to my wagon for
some medicin for her babi
what doe it mean macumazahn she ask when the pair had gone by
as thei thought unobserv sinc we were stand where thei could not
see us
i dont know and i dont want to know i answer sharpli
neither do i macumazahn but without doubt we shall learn in time if
the crocodil is patient and silent the buck alwai drop into it jaw
at last
on the dai after nandi made thi wise remark saduko start on a
mission as i understood to win over sever doubt chief to the
caus of indhlovuenesihlonti the elephantwiththetuftofhair as
the princ umbelazi wa call among the zulu though not to hi face
thi mission last ten dai and befor it wa conclud an import
event happen at umbezi kraal
on even mameena came to me in a great rage and said that she could
bear her present life no longer presum on her rank and posit as
headwif nandi treat her like a servantnai like a littl dog to
be beaten with a stick she wish that nandi would die
it will be veri unlucki for you if she doe i answer for then
perhap zikali will be summon to look into the matter as he wa
befor
what wa she to do she went on ignor my remark
eat the porridg that you have made in your own pot or break the pot
ie go awai i suggest there wa no need for you to marri saduko
ani more than there wa for you to marri masapo
how can you talk to me like that macumazahn she answer stamp
her foot when you know well it is your fault if i marri anyon
piff i hate them all and sinc my father would onli beat me if i took
my troubl to him i will run off and live in the wilder alon and
becom a witchdoctoress
i am afraid you will find it veri dull mameena i began in a
banter tone for to tell the truth i did not think it wise to show
her too much sympathi while she wa so excit
mameena never wait for the end of the sentenc but sob out that
i wa fals and cruel she turn and depart swiftli oh littl did i
forese how and where we should meet again
next morn i wa awaken shortli after sunris by scowl whom i had
sent out with anoth man the night befor to look for a lost ox
well have you found the ox i ask
ye baa but i did not waken you to tell you that i have a messag
for you baa from mameena wife of saduko whom i met about four hour
ago upon the plain yonder
i bade him set it out
these were the word of mameena baa sai to macumazahn your master
that indhlovuenesihlonti take piti on my wrong and love me
with hi heart ha offer to take me into hi hous and that i have
accept hi offer sinc i think it better to becom the inkosazana of
the zulu as i shall on dai than to remain a servant in the hous
of nandi sai to macumazahn that when saduko return he is to tell him
that thi is all hi fault sinc if he had kept nandi in her place i
would have di rather than leav him let him sai to saduko also that
although from henceforth we can be no more than friend my heart is
still tender toward him and that by dai and by night i will strive to
water hi great so that it mai grow into a tree that shall shade
the land let macumazahn bid him not to be angri with me sinc what i
do i do for hi good as he would have found no happi while nandi
and i dwelt in on hous abov all also let him not be angri with the
princ who love him more than ani man and doe but travel whither the
wind that i breath blow him bid macumazahn think of me kindli as i
shall of him while my ey ar open
i listen to thi amaz messag in silenc then ask if mameena wa
alon
no baa umbelazi and some soldier were with her but thei did
not hear her word for she step asid to speak with me then she
return to them and thei walk awai swiftli and were swallow up in
the night
veri good sikauli i said make me some coffe and make it strong
i dress and drank sever cup of the coffe all the while think
with my head as the zulu sai then i walk up to the kraal to see
umbezi whom i found just come out of hi hut yawn
why do you look so black upon thi beauti morn macumazahn
ask the genial old scamp have you lost your best cow or what
no my friend i answer but you and anoth have lost your best
cow and word for word i repeat to him mameena messag when i had
finish realli i thought that umbezi wa about to faint
curs be on the head of thi mameena he exclaim sure some evil
spirit must have been her father not i and well wa she call child
of storm what shall i do now macumazahn thank be to my spirit
he ad with an air of relief she is too far gone for me to try to
catch her also if i did umbelazi and hi soldier would kill me
that if i have not said so alreadi wa the mean
which the zulu gave to the word mameena although as i
know the languag i cannot get ani such interpret out
of the name i believ that it wa given to her howev
becaus she wa born just befor a terribl tempest when
the wind wail round the hut made a sound like the word
mameena a q
and what will saduko do if you dont i ask
oh of cours he will be angri for no doubt he is fond of her but
after all i am us to that you rememb how he went mad when she
marri masapo at least he cannot sai that i made her run awai with
umbelazi after all it is a matter which thei must settl between
them
i think it mai mean great troubl i said at a time when troubl is
not need
oh why so macumazahn my daughter did not get on with the princess
nandiew could all see thatfor thei would scarc speak to each
other and if saduko is fond of herwel after all there ar other
beauti women in zululand i know on or two of them myself whom i
will mention to sadukoor rather to nandi realli as thing were i
am not sure but that he is well rid of her
but what do you think of the matter as her father i ask for i
want to see to what length hi accommod moral would stretch
as her fatherwel of cours macumazahn as her father i am sorri
becaus it will mean talk will it not as the masapo busi
did still there is thi to be said for mameena he ad with a
brighten face she alwai run awai up the tree not down when she
got rid of masapoi mean when masapo wa kill for hi witchcraftsh
marri saduko who wa a bigger mansaduko whom she would not marri
when masapo wa the bigger man and now when she ha got rid of saduko
she enter the hut of umbelazi who will on dai be king of the zulu
the biggest man in all the world which mean that she will be the
biggest woman for rememb macumazahn she will walk round and round
that great umbelazi till whatev wai he look he will see her and no
on els oh she will grow great and carri up her poor old father
in the blanket on her back oh the sun still shine behind the cloud
macumazahn so let us make the best of the cloud sinc we know that it
will break out present
ye umbezi but other thing besid the sun break out from cloud
sometimeslightn for instanc lightn which kill
you speak illomen word macumazahn word that take awai my
appetit which is gener excel at thi hour well if mameena is
bad it is not my fault for i brought her up to be good after all
he ad with an outburst of petul why do you scold me when it is
your fault if you had run awai with the girl when you might have done
so there would have been none of thi troubl
perhap not i answer onli then i am sure i should have been dead
todai as i think that all who have to do with her will be er long
and now umbezi i wish you a good breakfast
on the follow morn saduko return and wa told the new by
nandi whom i had carefulli avoid on thi occas howev i wa
forc to be present as the person to whom the sin mameena had sent
her farewel messag it wa a veri pain experi of which i do
not rememb all the detail for a while after he learn the truth
saduko sat still as a stone stare in front of him with a face that
seem to have becom suddenli old then he turn upon umbezi and in a
few terribl word accus him of have arrang the matter in order to
advanc hi own fortun at the price of hi daughter dishonour next
without listen to hi exfatherinlaw volubl explan he
rose and said that he wa go awai to kill umbelazi the evildo who
had rob him of the wife he love with the conniv of all three of
us and by a sweep of hi hand he indic umbezi the princess nandi
and myself
thi wa more than i could stand so i too rose and ask him what he
meant ad in the irrit of the moment that if i had wish to
rob him of hi beauti mameena i thought i could have done so long
agoa remark that stagger him a littl
then nandi rose also and spoke in her quiet voic
saduko my husband she said i a princess of the zulu hous
marri you who ar not of royal blood becaus i love you and although
panda the king and umbelazi the princ wish it for no other reason
whatsoev well i have been faith to you through some trial even
when you set the widow of a wizardif inde as i have reason to
suspect she wa not herself the wizardbefor me and although that
wizard had kill our son live in her hut rather than in mine now
thi woman of whom you thought so much ha desert you for your
friend and my brother the princ umbelaziumbelazi who is call the
handsom and who if the fortun of war goe with him as it mai or
mai not will succe to panda my father thi she ha done becaus she
alleg that i your inkosikazi and the king daughter treat her as
a servant which is a lie i kept her in her place no more who if
she could have had her will would have oust me from mine perhap by
death for the wive of wizard learn their art on thi pretext she
ha left you but that is not her real reason she ha left you becaus
the princ my brother whom she ha befool with her trick and
beauti as she ha befool other or tri toand she glanc at
mei a bigger man than you ar you saduko mai becom great as my
heart prai that you will but my brother mai becom a king she doe
not love him ani more than she love you but she doe love the place
that mai be hi and therefor herssh who would be the first doe of
the herd my husband i think that you ar well rid of mameena for i
think also that if she had stai with us there would have been more
death in our hous perhap mine which would not matter and perhap
your which would matter much all thi i sai to you not from jealousi
of on who is fairer than i but becaus it is the truth therefor my
counsel to you is to let thi busi pass over and keep silent abov
all seek not to aveng yourself upon umbelazi sinc i am sure that he
ha taken vengeanc to dwell with him in hi own hut i have spoken
that thi moder and reason speech of nandi produc a great
effect upon saduko i could see but at the time the onli answer he made
to it wa
let the name of mameena be spoken no more within hear of my ear
mameena is dead
so her name wa heard no more in the hous of saduko and of umbezi and
when it wa necessari for ani reason to refer to her she wa given a
new name a composit zulu word owezulu i think it wa which is
stormchild shortli translat for zulu mean a storm as well as
the sky
i do not think that saduko spoke of her to me again until toward the
climax of thi histori and certainli i did not mention her to him but
from that dai forward i note that he wa a chang man hi pride and
open pleasur in hi great success which had caus the zulu to name
him the selfeat were no longer mark he becam cold and silent
like a man who is think deepli but who shutter hi thought lest
some should read them through the window of hi ey moreov he paid
a visit to zikali the littl and wise as i found out by accid but
what advic that cun old dwarf gave to him i did not find outthen
the onli other event which happen in connect with thi elop
wa that a messag came from umbelazi to saduko brought by on of the
princ a brother of umbelazi who wa of hi parti as i know for
i heard it deliv it wa a veri humbl messag when the rel
posit of the two men ar consideredthat of on who knew that he
had done wrong and if not repent wa heartili asham of himself
saduko it said i have stolen a cow of your and i hope you will
forgiv me sinc that cow did not love the pastur in your kraal but
in mine she grow fat and is content moreov in return i will give
you mani other cow everyth that i have to give i will give to you
who ar my friend and trust councillor send me word o saduko that
thi wall which i have built between us is broken down sinc er long
you and i must stand togeth in war
to thi messag saduko answer wa
o princ you ar troubl about a veri littl thing that cow which
you have taken wa of no worth to me for who wish to keep a beast
that is ever tear and low at the gate of the kraal disturb
those who would sleep insid with her nois had you ask her of me
i would have given her to you freeli i thank you for your offer but i
need no more cow especi if like thi on thei have no calv
as for a wall between us there is none for how can two men who if the
battl is to be won must stand shoulder to shoulder fight if divid
by a wall o son of the king i am dream by dai and night of the
battl and the victori and i have forgotten all about the barren cow
that ran awai after you the great bull of the herd onli do not be
surpris if on dai you find that thi cow ha a sharp horn
chapter xii panda prayer
about six week later in the month of novemb 1856 i chanc to
be at nodwengu when the quarrel between the princ came to a head
although none of the regiment wa actual allow to enter the
townthat is as a regimentth place wa full of peopl all of them
in a state of great excit who came in dure the daytim and went
to sleep in the neighbour militari kraal at night on even
as some of these soldiersabout a thousand of them if i rememb
rightwer return to the ukubaza kraal a fight occur between
them which led to the final outbreak
as it happen at that time there were two separ regiment station
at thi kraal i think that thei were the imkulutshana and the hlaba
on of which favour cetewayo and the other umbelazi as certain
compani of each of these regiment march along togeth in parallel
line two of their captain got into disput on the etern subject of
the success to the throne from word thei came to blow and the end
of it wa that he who favour umbelazi kill him who favour cetewayo
with hi kerri thereon the comrad of the slain man rais a shout
of usutu which becam the warcri of cetewayo parti fell upon the
other and a dread combat ensu fortun the soldier were onli
arm with stick or the slaughter would have been veri great but as
it wa after an indecis engag about fifti men were kill and
mani more injur
now with my usual bad luck i who had gone out to shoot a few bird
for the potpauw or bustard i think thei werewa return across
thi veri plain to my old encamp in the kloof where masapo had been
execut and so ran into the fight just as it wa begin i saw the
captain kill and the subsequ engag inde as it happen i
did more not know where to go or what to do for i wa quit alon
i pull up my hors behind a tree and wait till i could escap the
horror about me for i can assur anyon who mai ever read these word
that it is a veri horribl sight to see a thousand men engag in fierc
and deadli combat in truth the fact that thei had no spear and could
onli batter each other to death with their heavi kerri made it wors
sinc the duel were more desper and prolong
everywher men were roll on the ground hit at each other
head until at last some blow went home and on of them threw out hi
arm and lai still either dead or senseless well there i sat watch
all thi shock busi from the saddl of my train shoot poni
which stood like a stone till present i becam awar of two great
fellow rush at me with their ey start out of their head and
shout as thei came
kill umbelazi white man kill kill
then see that the matter wa urgent and that it wa a question of my
life or their i came into action
in my hand i held a doublebarrel shotgun load with what we us
to call looper or bb shot of which but a few went to each charg
for i had hope to meet with a small buck on my wai to camp so as
these soldier came i lift the gun and fire the right barrel at
on of them and the left barrel at the other aim in each case at the
centr of the small danc shield which from forc of habit thei held
stretch out to protect their throat and breast at that distanc of
cours the looper sank through the soft hide of the shield and deep
into the bodi of those who carri them so that both of them drop
dead the lefthand man be so close that he fell against my poni hi
uplift kerri strike me upon the thigh and bruis me
when i saw what i had done and that my danger wa over for the moment
without wait to reload i dug the spur into my hors side and
gallop off to nodwengu pass between the group of struggl men
on arriv unharm at the town i went instantli to the royal hut and
demand to see the king who sent word that i wa to be admit
on come befor him i told him exactli what had happenedthat i had
kill two of cetewayo men in order to save my own life and on that
account submit myself to hi justic
o macumazana said panda in great distress i know well that you
ar not to blame and alreadi i have sent out a regiment to stop thi
fight with command that those who caus it should be brought befor
me tomorrow for judgment i am glad inde macumazahn that you have
escap without harm but i must tell you that i fear henceforth your
life will be in danger sinc all the usutu parti will hold it forfeit
if thei can catch you while you ar in my town i can protect you for i
will set a strong guard about your camp but here you will have to
stai until these troubl ar done with sinc if you leav you mai be
murder on the road
i thank you for your kind king i answer but all thi is veri
awkward for me who hope to trek for natal tomorrow
well there it is macumazahn you will have to stai here unless
you wish to be kill he who walk into a storm must put up with the
hailston
so it came about that onc again fate drag me into the zulu
maelstrom
on the morrow i wa summon to the trial half as a wit and half
as on of the offend go to the head of the nodwengu kraal where
panda wa sit in state with hi council i found the whole great
space in front of him crowd with a dens concours of fiercefac
partisan those who favour cetewayoth usutusit on the right
and those who favour umbelazith isigqosasit on the left at
the head of the righthand section sat cetewayo hi brethren and chief
men at the head of the lefthand section sat umbelazi hi brethren and
hi chief men amongst whom i saw saduko take a place immedi behind
the princ so that he could whisper into hi ear
to myself and my littl band of eight hunter who by panda express
permiss came arm with their gun as i did also for i wa
determin that if the necess aros we would sell our live as dearli
as we could wa appoint a place almost in front of the king and
between the two faction when everyon wa seat the trial began
panda demand to know who had caus the tumult of the previou night
i cannot set out what follow in all it detail for it would be too
long also i have forgotten mani of them i rememb howev that
cetewayo peopl said that umbelazi men were the aggressor and that
umbelazi peopl said that cetewayo men were the aggressor and that
each of their parti back up these statement which were given at
great length with loud shout
how am i to know the truth exclaim panda at last macumazahn you
were there step forward and tell it to me
so i stood out and told the king what i had seen name that the
captain who favour cetewayo had begun the quarrel by strike the
captain who favour umbelazi but that in the end umbelazi man had
kill cetewayo man after which the fight commenc
then it would seem that the usutu ar to blame said panda
upon what ground do you sai so my father ask cetewayo spring
up upon the testimoni of thi white man who is well known to be the
friend of umbelazi and of hi henchman saduko and who himself kill
two of those who call me chief in the cours of the fight
ye cetewayo i broke in becaus i thought it better that i should
kill them than that thei should kill me whom thei attack quit
unprovok
at ani rate you kill them littl white man shout cetewayo for
which caus your blood is forfeit sai did umbelazi give you leav to
appear befor the king accompani by men arm with gun when we who
ar hi son must come with stick onli if so let him protect you
that i will do if there is need exclaim umbelazi
thank you princ i said but if there is need i will protect myself
as i did yesterdai and cock my doublebarrel rifl i look
full at cetewayo
when you leav here then at least i will come even with you
macumazahn threaten cetewayo spit through hi teeth as wa hi
wai when mad with passion
for he wa besid himself and wish to vent hi temper on someon
although in truth he and i were alwai good friend
if so i shall stop where i am i answer coolli in the shadow of
the king your father moreov ar you so lost in folli cetewayo
that you should wish to bring the english about your ear know that if
i am kill you will be ask to give account of my blood
ay interrupt panda and know that if anyon lai a finger on
macumazana who is my guest he shall die whether he be a common man or
a princ and my son also cetewayo i fine you twenti head of cattl
to be paid to macumazana becaus of the unprovok attack which your men
made upon him when he rightli slew them
the fine shall be paid my father said cetewayo more quietli for he
saw that in threaten me he had push matter too far
then after some more talk panda gave judgment in the caus which
judgment realli amount to noth as it wa imposs to decid
which parti wa most to blame he fine both an equal number of cattl
accompani the fine with a lectur on their illbehaviour which wa
listen to indiffer
after thi matter wa dispos of the real busi of the meet
began
rise to hi feet cetewayo address panda
my father he said the land wander and wander in dark and you
alon can give light for it feet i and my brother umbelazi ar at
varianc and the quarrel is a great on name as to which of us is
to sit in your place when you ar gone down when we call and you
do not answer some of the nation favour on of us and some favour
the other but you o king and you alon have the voic of judgment
still befor you speak i and those who stand with me would bring thi
to your mind my mother umqumbazi is your inkosikazi your headwif
and therefor accord to our law i her eldest son should be your
heir moreov when you fled to the boer befor the fall of him who
sat in your place befor you dingaan did not thei the white amabunu
ask you which amongst your son wa your heir and did you not point
me out to the white men and thereon did not the amabunu cloth me in a
dress of honour becaus i wa the king to be but now of late the mother
of umbelazi ha been whisper in your ear as have othersand he
look at saduko and some of umbelazi brethrenand your face ha
grown cold toward me so cold that mani sai that you will point out
umbelazi to be king after you and stamp on my name if thi is so my
father tell me at onc that i mai know what to do
have finish thi speech which certainli did not lack forc and
digniti cetewayo sat down again await the answer in sullen silenc
but make none panda look at umbelazi who on rise wa greet
with a great cheer for although cetewayo had the larger follow in
the land especi among the distant chief the zulu individu
love umbelazi more perhap becaus of hi statur beauti and kindli
dispositionphys and moral qualiti that natur appeal to a
savag nation
my father he said like my brother cetewayo i await your word
whatev you mai have said to the amabunu in hast or fear i do not
admit that cetewayo wa ever proclaim your heir in the hear of the
zulu peopl i sai that my right to the success is as good as hi
and that it li with you and you alon to declar which of us shall
put on the royal kaross in dai that my heart prai mai be distant
still to save bloodsh i am will to divid the land with cetewayo
here both panda and cetewayo shook their head and the audienc roar
nai or if that doe not pleas him i am will to meet cetewayo
man to man and spear to spear and fight till on of us be slain
a safe offer sneer cetewayo for is not my brother name
eleph and the strongest warrior among the zulu no i will not
set the fortun of those who cling to me on the chanc of a singl
stab or on the might of a man muscl decid o father sai which
of the two of us is to sit at the head of your kraal after you have gone
over to the spirit and ar but an ancestor to be worship
now panda look much disturb as wa not wonder sinc rush
out from the fenc behind which thei had been listen umqumbazi
cetewayo mother whisper into on of hi ear while umbelazi
mother whisper into the other what advic each of them gave i do not
know although obvious it wa not the same advic sinc the poor man
roll hi ey first at on and then at the other and final put hi
hand over hi ear that he might hear no more
choos choos o king shout the audienc who is to succe you
cetewayo or umbelazi
watch panda i saw that he fell into a kind of agoni hi fat side
heav and although the dai wa cold sweat ran from hi brow
what would the white men do in such a case he said to me in a hoars
low voic whereon i answer look at the ground and speak so
that few could hear me
i think o king that a white man would do noth he would sai that
other might settl the matter after he wa dead
would that i could sai so too mutter panda but it is not
possibl
then follow a long paus dure which all were silent for everi man
there felt that the hour wa big with doom at length panda rose with
difficulti becaus of hi unwieldi weight and utter these fate
word that were none the less omin becaus of the home idiom in
which thei were couch
when two young bull quarrel thei must fight it out
instantli in on tremend roar vollei forth the royal salut of
bayt a signal of the accept of the king wordth word that
meant civil war and the death of mani thousand
then panda turn and so feebli that i thought he would fall walk
through the gatewai behind him follow by the rival queen each of
these ladi struggl to be first after him in the gate think that
it would be an omen of success for her son final howev to the
disappoint of the multitud thei onli succeed in pass it side
by side
when thei had gone the great audienc began to break up the men of
each parti march awai togeth as though by common consent without
offer ani insult or molest to their adversari i think that
thi peaceabl attitud aros howev from the knowledg that matter
had now pass from the stage of privat quarrel into that of public
war it wa felt that their disput await decis not with stick
outsid the nodwengu kraal but with spear upon some great battlefield
for which thei went to prepar
within two dai except for those regiment which panda kept to guard
hi person scarc a soldier wa to be seen in the neighbourhood of
nodwengu the princ also depart to muster their adher cetewayo
establish himself among the mandhlakazi that he command and
umbelazi return to the kraal of umbezi which happen to stand
almost in the centr of that part of the nation which adher to him
whether he took mameena with him there i am not certain i believ
howev that fear lest her welcom at her birthplac should be
warmer than she wish she settl herself at some retir and outli
kraal in the neighbourhood and there await the crisi of her fortun
at ani rate i saw noth of her for she wa care to keep out of my
wai
with umbelazi and saduko howev i did have an interview befor thei
left nodwengu thei call on me togeth appar on the best of
term and said in effect that thei hope for my support in the come
war
i answer that howev well i might like them person a zulu civil
war wa no affair of mine and that inde for everi reason includ
the suprem on of my own safeti i had better get out of the wai at
onc
thei argu with me for a long while make great offer and promis
of reward till at length when he saw that my determin could not
be shaken umbelazi said
come saduko let us humbl ourselv no more befor thi white man
after all he is right the busi is none of hi and why should we
ask him to risk hi life in our quarrel know as we do that white
men ar not like us thei think a great deal of their live farewel
macumazahn if i conquer and grow great you will alwai be welcom in
zululand wherea if i fail perhap you will be best over the tugela
river
now i felt the hidden taunt in thi speech veri keenli still be
determin that for onc i would be wise and not allow my natur
curios and love of adventur to drag me into more risk and troubl
i repli
the princ sai that i am not brave and love my life and what he sai
is true i fear fight who by natur am a trader with the heart of
a trader not a warrior with the heart of a warrior like the great
indhlovuenesihlontiword at which i saw the grave saduko smile
faintli so farewel to you princ and mai good fortun attend you
of cours to call the princ to hi face by thi nicknam which
refer to a defect in hi person wa someth of an insult but
i had been insult and meant to give him a roland for hi oliv
howev he took it in good part
what is good fortun macumazahn umbelazi repli as he grasp my
hand sometim i think that to live and prosper is good fortun and
sometim i think that to die and sleep is good fortun for in sleep
there is neither hunger nor thirst of bodi or of spirit in sleep there
come no care in sleep ambit ar at rest nor do those who look no
more upon the sun smart beneath the treacheri of fals women or fals
friend should the battl turn against me macumazahn at least that
good fortun will be mine for never will i live to be crush beneath
cetewayo heel
then he went saduko accompani him for a littl wai but make some
excus to the princ came back and said to me
macumazahn my friend i dare sai that we part for the last time and
therefor i make a request to you it is as to on who is dead to me
macumazahn i believ that umbelazi the thiefthes word broke from
hi lip with a hissha given her mani cattl and hidden her awai
either in the kloof of zikali the wise or near to it under hi care
now if the war should go against umbelazi and i should be kill in
it i think evil will fall upon that woman head i who have grown sure
that it wa she who wa the wizard and not masapo the boar also as on
connect with umbelazi who ha help him in hi plot she will be
kill if she is caught macumazahn hearken to me i will tell you the
truth my heart is still on fire for that woman she ha bewitch me
her ey haunt my sleep and i hear her voic in the wind she is more to
me than all the earth and all the sky and although she ha wrong me
i do not wish that harm should come to her macumazahn i prai you if i
die do your best to befriend her even though it be onli as a servant
in your hous for i think that she care more for you than for anyon
who onli ran awai with himand he point in the direct that
umbelazi had takenbecaus he is a princ who in her folli she
believ will be a king at least take her to natal macumazahn where
if you wish to be free of her she can marri whom she will and will live
safe until night come panda love you much and whoever conquer in
the war will give you her life if you ask it of him
then thi strang man drew the back of hi hand across hi ey from
which i saw the tear were run and mutter if you would have
good fortun rememb my prayer turn and left me befor i could
answer a singl word
as for me i sat down upon an antheap and whistl a whole hymn tune
that my mother had taught me befor i could think at all to be left
the guardian of mameena talk of a damnosa heredita a terribl and
mischiev inheritancewhi thi wa the worst that ever i heard of
a servant in my hous inde know what i did about her why i had
sooner share the good fortun which umbelazi anticip beneath
the sod howev that wa not in the question and without it the
altern of act as her guardian wa bad enough though i comfort
myself with the reflect that the circumst in which thi would
becom necessari might never aris for ala i wa sure that if thei
did aris i should have to live up to them true i had made no promis
to saduko with my lip but i felt as i knew he felt that thi promis
had pass from my heart to hi
that thief umbelazi strang word to be utter by a great vassal of
hi lord and both of them about to enter upon a desper enterpris
a princ whom in her folli she believ will be a king stranger word
still then saduko did not believ that he would be a king and yet he
wa about to share the fortun of hi fight for the throne he who said
that hi heart wa still on fire for the woman whom umbelazi the thief
had stolen well if i were umbelazi thought i to myself i would
rather that saduko were not my chief councillor and gener but thank
heaven i wa not umbelazi or saduko or ani of them and thank heaven
still more i wa go to begin my trek from zululand on the morrow
man propos but god dispos i did not trek from zululand for mani a
long dai when i got back to my wagon it wa to find that my oxen had
mysteri disappear from the veld on which thei were accustom
to graze thei were lost or perhap thei had felt the urgent need of
trek from zululand back to a more peac countri i sent all the
hunter i had with me to look for them onli scowl and i remain
at the wagon which in those disturb time i did not like to leav
unguard
four dai went by a week went by and no sign of either hunter or
oxen then at last a messag which reach me in some roundabout
fashion to the effect that the hunter had found the oxen a long wai
off but on try to return to nodwengu had been driven by some of
the usututhat is by cetewayo partyacross the tugela into natal
whenc thei dare not attempt to return
for onc in my life i went into a rage and curs that nondescript kind
of messeng sent by i know not whom in languag that i think he will
not forget then realis the futil of swear at a mere tool i
went up to the great hous and demand an audienc with panda himself
present the inceku or household servant to whom i gave my messag
return sai that i wa to be admit at onc and on enter the
enclosur i found the king sit at the head of the kraal quit alon
except for a man who wa hold a larg shield over him in order to
keep off the sun
he greet me warmli and i told him my troubl about the oxen whereon
he sent awai the shieldhold leav us two togeth
watcherbynight he said why do you blame me for these event when
you know that i am nobodi in my own hous i sai that i am a dead man
whose son fight for hi inherit i cannot tell you for certain who
it wa that drove awai your oxen still i am glad that thei ar gone
sinc i believ that if you had attempt to trek to natal just now you
would have been kill on the road by the usutu who believ you to be a
councillor of umbelazi
i understand o king i answer and i dare sai that the accid of
the loss of my oxen is fortun for me but tell me now what am i to
do i wish to follow the exampl of john dunn anoth white man in the
countri who wa much mix up with zulu polit and leav the land
will you give me more oxen to draw my wagon
i have none that ar broken in macumazahn for as you know we zulu
possess few wagon and if i had i would not lend them to you who do
not desir that your blood should be upon my head
you ar hide someth from me o king i said bluntli what is it
that you want me to do stai here at nodwengu
no macumazahn when the troubl begin i want you to go with a
regiment of my own that i shall send to the assist of my son
umbelazi so that he mai have the benefit of your wisdom o macumazana
i will tell you the truth my heart love umbelazi and i fear me that
he is overmatch by cetewayo if i could i would save hi life but i
know not how to do so sinc i must not seem to take side too openli
but i can send down a regiment as your escort if you choos to go to
view the battl as my agent and make report to me sai will you not
go
why should i go i answer see that whoever win i mai be
kill and that if cetewayo win i shall certainli be kill and all
for no reward
nai macumazahn i will give order that whoever conquer the man that
dare to lift a spear against you shall die in thi matter at least i
shall not be disobei oh i prai you do not desert me in my troubl
go down with the regiment that i shall send and breath your wisdom into
the ear of my son umbelazi as for your reward i swear to you by the
head of the black on chaka that it shall be great i will see to it
that you do not leav zululand emptyhand macumazahn
still i hesit for i mistrust me of thi busi
o watcherbynight exclaim panda you will not desert me will
you i am afraid for the son of my heart umbelazi whom i love abov
all my children i am much afraid for umbelazi and he burst into tear
befor me
it wa foolish no doubt but the sight of the old king weep for hi
bestbelov child whom he believ to be doom move me so much that
i forgot my caution
if you wish it o panda i said i will go down to the battl with
your regiment and stand there by the side of the princ umbelazi
chapter xiii umbelazi the fallen
so i stai on at nodwengu who inde had no choic in the matter
and wa veri wretch and ill at eas the place wa almost desert
except for a coupl of regiment which were quarter there the
sangqu and the amawomb thi latter wa the royal regiment a kind
of household guard to which the king chaka dingaan and panda all
belong in turn most of the headmen had taken on side or the other
and were awai rais forc to fight for cetewayo or umbelazi and even
the greater part of the women and children had gone to hide themselv
in the bush or among the mountain sinc none knew what would happen
or if the conquer armi would not fall upon and destroi them
a few councillor howev remain with panda among whom wa old
maputa the gener who had onc brought me the messag of the pill
sever time he visit me at night and told me the rumour that were
fly about from these i gather that some skirmish had taken place
and the battl could not be long delai also that umbelazi had chosen
hi fight ground a plain near the bank of the tugela
why ha he done thi i ask see that then he will have a
broad river behind him and if he is defeat water can kill as well as
spear
i know not for certain answer maputa but it is said becaus of a
dream that saduko hi gener ha dream thrice which dream declar
that there and there alon umbelazi will find honour at ani rate he
ha chosen thi place and i am told that all the women and children of
hi armi by thousand ar hidden in the bush along the bank of the
river so that thei mai fly into natal if there is need
have thei wing i ask wherewith to fly over the tugela in
wrath as it well mai be after the rain oh sure hi spirit ha
turn from umbelazi
ay macumazahn he answer i too think that ufulatew idhlozi
that is hi own spirit ha turn it back on him also i think that
saduko is no good councillor inde were i the princ ad the old
fellow shrewdli i would not keep him whose wife i had stolen as the
whisper in my ear
nor i maputa i answer as i bade him goodby
two dai later earli in the morn maputa came to me again and said
that panda wish to see me i went to the head of the kraal where i
found the king seat and befor him the captain of the royal amawomb
regiment
watcherbynight he said i have new that the great battl between
my son will take place within a few dai therefor i am send down
thi my own royal regiment under the command of maputa the skill in
war to spy out the battl and i prai that you will go with it that
you mai give to the gener maputa and to the captain the help of
your wisdom now these ar my order to you maputa and to you o
captainsthat you take no part in the fight unless you should see that
the eleph my son umbelazi is fallen into a pit and that then you
shall drag him out if you can and save him aliv now repeat my word to
me
so thei repeat the word speak with on voic
your answer o macumazana he said when thei had spoken
o king i have told you that i will gothough i do not like warand i
will keep my promis i repli
then make readi macumazahn and be back here within an hour for the
regiment march er noon
so i went up to my wagon and hand them over to the care of some men
whom panda had sent to take charg of them also scowl and i saddl our
hors for thi faith fellow insist upon accompani me although
i advis him to stai behind and got out our rifl and as much
ammunit as we could possibl need and with them a few other
necessari these thing done we rode back to the gatheringplac
take farewel of the wagon with a sad heart sinc i for on never
expect to see them again
as we went i saw that the regiment of the amawomb pick men everi on
of them all fifti year of ag or over nearli four thousand strong
wa marshal on the dancingground where thei stood compani
by compani a magnific sight thei were with their white
fightingshield their gleam spear their otterskin cap their
kilt and armlet of white bull tail and the snowi egret plume
which thei wore upon their brow we rode to the head of them where i
saw maputa and as i came thei greet me with a cheer of welcom for
in those dai a white man wa a power in the land moreov as i have
said the zulu knew and like me well also the fact that i wa to
watch or perchanc to fight with them put a good heart into the
amawomb
there we stood until the lad sever hundr of them who bore
the mat and cook vessel and drove the cattl that were to be
our commissariat had wend awai in a long line then suddenli panda
appear out of hi hut accompani by a few servant and seem
to utter some kind of prayer as he did so throw dust or powder
medicin toward us though what thi ceremoni meant i did not
understand
when he had finish maputa rais a spear whereon the whole regiment
in perfect time shout out the royal salut bayt with a
sound like that of thunder thrice thei repeat thi tremend and
impress salut and then were silent again maputa rais hi spear
and all the four thousand voic broke out into the ingoma or nation
chant to which deep aweinspir music we began our march as i do
not think it ha ever been written down i will quot the word thei
ran thu

publish for the first time which i suppos will never
again pass the lip of a zulu impi mean
thei ie the enemi bear him ie the king hatr
thei call down curs on hi head
all of them throughout thi land
abhor our king
the ingoma when sung by twenti or thirti thousand men
rush down to battl must inde have been a song to
heareditor
the spirit of thi fierc ingoma convei by sound gestur and
inflect of voic not the exact word rememb which ar veri rude

lo where our impi wait
vengeanc insati
it wa earli on the morn of the 2nd of decemb a cold miser
morn that came with wind and drive mist that i found myself with
the amawomb at the place known as endondakusuka a plain with some
kopj in it that li within six mile of the natal border from which
it is separ by the tugela river
as the order of the amawomb were to keep out of the frai if that were
possibl we had taken up a posit about a mile to the right of what
prove to be the actual battlefield choos as our camp ground
a rise knoll that look like a huge tumulu and wa front at a
distanc of about five hundr yard by anoth smaller knoll behind us
stretch bushland or rather broken land where mimosa thorn grew in
scatter group slope down to the bank of the tugela about four
mile awai
shortli after dawn i wa rous from the place where i slept wrap
up in some blanket under a mimosa treefor of cours we had no
tentsbi a messeng who said that the princ umbelazi and the white
man john dunn wish to see me i rose and tidi myself as best i
could sinc if i can avoid it i never like to appear befor nativ
in a dishevel condit i rememb that i had just finish brush
my hair when umbelazi arriv
i can see him now look a verit giant in that morn mist
inde there wa someth quit unearthli about hi appear as
he aros out of those roll vapour such light as there wa be
concentr upon the blade of hi big spear which wa well known as
the broadest carri by ani warrior in zululand and a copper torqu he
wore about hi throat
there he stood roll hi ey and hug hi kaross around him
becaus of the cold and someth in hi anxiou indetermin
express told me at onc that he knew himself to be a man in terribl
danger just behind him dark and brood hi arm fold on
hi breast hi ey fix upon the ground look to my move
imagin like an evil geniu stood the state and grace saduko
on hi left wa a young and sturdi white man carri a rifl and
smoke a pipe whom i guess to be john dunn a gentleman whom as it
chanc i had never met while behind were a forc of natal govern
zulu clad in some kind of uniform and arm with gun and with them a
number of nativ also from natalkra kafir who carri stab
assegai on of these led john dunn hors
of those govern men there mai have been thirti or forti and of the
kraal kafir anyth between two and three hundr
i shook umbelazi hand and gave him gooddai
that is an ill dai upon which no sun shine o macumazana he
answeredword that struck me as omin then he introduc me to john
dunn who seem glad to meet anoth white man next not know what
to sai i ask the exact object of their visit whereon dunn began to
talk he said that he had been sent over on the previou afternoon by
captain walmslei who wa an offic of the natal govern station
across the border to try to make peac between the zulu faction but
that when he spoke of peac on of umbelazi brothersi think it wa
mantantashiyahad mock at him sai that thei were quit strong
enough to cope with the usututhat wa cetewayo parti also he
ad that when he suggest that the thousand of women and children
and the cattl should be got across the tugela drift dure the previou
night into safeti in natal mantantashiya would not listen and umbelazi
be absent seek the aid of the natal govern he could do
noth
quem deu vult perder priu dementat whom god wish to destroi he
first make mad quot i to myself beneath my breath thi wa on of
the latin tag that my old father who wa a scholar had taught me
and at that moment it came back to my mind but as i suspect that john
dunn knew no latin i onli said aloud
what an infern fool we were talk in english cant you get
umbelazi to do it now i meant to send the women and children across
the river
i fear it is too late mr quatermain he answer the usutu ar
in sight look for yourself and he hand me a telescop which he had
with him
i climb on to some rock and scan the plain in front of us from
which just then a puff of wind roll awai the mist it wa black with
advanc men as yet thei were a consider distanc awayquit two
mile i should thinkand come on veri slowli in a great halfmoon
with thin horn and a deep breast but a rai from the sun glitter upon
their countless spear it seem to me that there must be quit twenti
or thirti thousand of them in thi breast which wa in three divis
command as i learn afterward by cetewayo uzimela and by a young
boer name groen
there thei ar right enough i said climb down from my rock
what ar you go to do mr dunn
obei order and try to make peac if i can find anyon to make peac
with and if i cantwel fight i suppos and you mr quatermain
oh obei order and stop here i suppos unless i ad doubtfulli
these amawomb take the bit between their teeth and run awai with me
theyll do that befor nightfal mr quatermain if i know anyth of
the zulu look here why dont you get on your hors and come off with
me thi is a queer place for you
becaus i promis not to i answer with a groan for realli as
i look at those savag round me who were alreadi finger their
spear in a disagre fashion and those other thousand of savag
advanc toward us i felt such littl courag as i possess sink
into my boot
veri well mr quatermain you know your own busi best but i hope
you will come out of it safe that is all
same to you i repli
then john dunn turn and in my hear ask umbelazi what he knew of
the movement of the usutu and of their plan of battl
the princ repli with a shrug of hi shoulder
noth at present son of mr dunn but doubtless befor the sun is
high i shall know much
as he spoke a sudden gust of wind struck us and tore the nod
ostrich plume from it fasten on umbelazi headr whilst a
murmur of dismai rose from all who saw what thei consid thi veri
illomen accid awai it float into the air to fall gentli to the
ground at the feet of saduko he stoop pick it up and reset it
in it place sai as he did so with that readi wit for which some
kafir ar remark
so mai i live o princ to set the crown upon the head of panda
favour son
thi apt speech serv to dispel the gener gloom caus by the
incid for those who heard it cheer while umbelazi thank hi
captain with a nod and a smile onli i note that saduko did not mention
the name of panda favour son upon whose head he hope to live to
set the crown now panda had mani son and that dai would show which
of them wa favour
a minut or two later john dunn and hi follow depart as he said
to try to make peac with the advanc usutu umbelazi saduko and
their escort depart also toward the main bodi of the host of the
isigqosa which wa mass to our left sit on their spear as
the nativ sai and await the attack as for me i remain alon
with the amawomb drink some coffe that scowl had brew for me
and forc myself to swallow food
i can sai honestli that i do not ever rememb partak of a more
unhappi meal not onli did i believ that i wa look on the last sun
i should ever seethough by the wai there wa uncommonli littl of
that orb visiblebut what made the matter wors wa that if so i
should be call upon to die alon among savag with not a singl
white face near to comfort me oh how i wish i had never allow
myself to be drag into thi dread busi ye and i wa even
mean enough to wish that i had broken my word to panda and gone off with
john dunn when he invit me although now i thank good that i did
not yield to that temptat and therebi sacrific my selfrespect
soon howev thing grew so excit that i forgot these and other
melancholi reflect in watch the develop of event from the
summit of our tumuluslik knoll whenc i had a magnific view of the
whole battl here after see that hi regiment made a full meal
as a good gener should old maputa join me whom i ask whether he
thought there would be ani fight for him that dai
i think so i think so he answer cheerfulli it seem to me that
the usutu greatli outnumb umbelazi and the isigqosa and of cours
as you know panda order ar that if he is in danger we must help
him oh keep a good heart macumazahn for i believ i can promis you
that you will see our spear grow red todai you will not go hungri
from thi battl to tell the white peopl that the amawomb ar coward
whom you could not flog into the fight no no macumazahn my spirit
look toward me thi morn and i who am old and who thought that
i should die at length like a cow shall see on more great fightmi
twentieth macumazahn for i fought with thi same amawomb in all the
black on big battl and for panda against dingaan also
perhap it will be your last i suggest
i dare sai macumazahn but what doe that matter if onli i and the
royal regiment can make an end that shall be spoken of oh cheer up
cheer up macumazahn your spirit too look toward you as i promis
that we all will do when the shield meet for know macumazahn that we
poor black soldier expect that you will show us how to fight thi dai
and if need be how to fall hidden in a heap of the foe
oh i repli so thi is what you zulu mean by the give of
counsel is ityou infern bloodthirsti old scoundrel i ad in
english
but i think maputa never heard me at ani rate he onli seiz my arm
and point in front a littl to the left where the horn of the great
usutu armi wa come up fast a long thin line aliv with twinkl
spear their move arm and leg caus them to look like spider of
which the bodi were form by the great war shield
see their plan he said thei would close on umbelazi and gore him
with their horn and then charg with their head the horn will pass
between us and the right flank of the isigqosa oh awak awak
eleph ar you asleep with mameena in a hut unloos your spear
child of the king and at them as thei mount the slope behold he went
on it is the son of dunn that begin the battl did i not tell you
that we must look to the white men to show us the wai peep through your
tube macumazahn and tell me what pass
so i peep and the telescop which john dunn had kindli left with
me be good though small saw everyth clearli enough he rode
up almost to the point of the left horn of the usutu wave a white
handkerchief and follow by hi small forc of polic and natal kafir
then from somewher among the usutu rose a puff of smoke dunn had been
fire at
he drop the handkerchief and leapt to the ground now he and hi
polic were fire rapidli in repli and men fell fast among the usutu
thei rais their war shout and came on though slowli for thei fear
the bullet step by step john dunn and hi peopl were thrust back
fight gallantli against overwhelm odd thei were level with us
not a quarter of a mile to our left thei were push past us thei
vanish among the bush behind us and a long while pass befor ever i
heard what becam of them for we met no more that dai
now the horn have done their work and wrap themselv round
umbelazi armi as the nipper of a wasp close about a fly why did
not umbelazi cut off those horn i wonder the usutu bull began
hi charg twenti or thirti thousand strong regiment after regiment
cetewayo men rush up the slope and there near the crest of
it were met by umbelazi regiment spring forward to repel the
onslaught and shout their battlecri of laba laba laba laba
the nois of their meet shield came to our ear like that of the
roll of thunder and the sheen of their stabbingspear shone as shine
the broad summer lightn thei hung and waver on the slope then
from the amawomb rank rose a roar of
umbelazi win
watch intent we saw the usutu give back down the slope thei
went leav the ground in front of them cover with black spot which
we knew to be dead or wound men
why doe not the eleph charg home said maputa in a perplex
voic the usutu bull is on hi back why doe he not trampl him
becaus he is afraid i suppos i answer and went on watch
there wa plenti to see as it happen find that thei were not
pursu cetewayo impi reform swiftli at the bottom of the slope
in prepar for anoth charg among that of umbelazi abov them
rapid movement took place of which i could not guess the mean
which movement were accompani by much nois of angri shout then
suddenli from the midst of the isigqosa armi emerg a great bodi of
men thousand strong which ran swiftli but in open order down the
slope toward the usutu hold their spear revers at first i
thought that thei were charg independ till i saw the usutu
rank open to receiv them with a shout of welcom
treacheri i said who is it
saduko with the amakoba and amangwan soldier and other i know them
by their headdress answer maputa in a cold voic
do you mean that saduko ha gone over to cetewayo with all hi
follow i ask excitedli
what els macumazahn saduko is a traitor umbelazi is finish and
he pass hi hand swiftli across hi moutha gestur that ha onli on
mean among the zulu
as for me i sat down upon a stone and groan for now i understood
everyth
present the usutu rais fierc triumphant shout and onc again
their impi swell with saduko power began to advanc up the slope
umbelazi and those of the isigqosa parti who clung to himnow i
should judg not more than eight thousand mennev stai to wait the
onslaught thei broke thei fled in a hideou rout crash through
the thin left horn of the usutu by mere weight of number and
pass behind us obliqu on their road to the bank of the tugela a
messeng rush up to us pant
these ar the word of umbelazi he gasp o watcherbynight and o
maputa indhlovuenesihlonti prai that you will hold back the usutu
as the king bade you do in case of need and so give to him and those
who cling to him time to escap with the women and children into
natal hi gener saduko ha betrai him and gone over with three
regiment to cetewayo and therefor we can no longer stand against the
thousand of the usutu
go tell the princ that macumazahn maputa and the amawomb regiment
will do their best answer maputa calmli still thi is our advic
to him that he should cross the tugela swiftli with the women and the
children see that we ar few and cetewayo is mani
the messeng leapt awai but as i heard afterward he never found
umbelazi sinc the poor man wa kill within five hundr yard of
where we stood
then maputa gave an order and the amawomb form themselv into a
tripl line thirteen hundr men in the first line thirteen hundr
men in the second line and about a thousand in the third behind whom
were the carrier boi three or four hundr of them the place assign
to me wa in the exact centr of the second line where be mount
on a hors it wa thought as i gather that i should serv as a
conveni rallyingpoint
in thi format we advanc a few hundr yard to our left evid
with the object of interpos ourselv between the rout impi and the
pursu usutu or if the latter should elect to go round us with that
of threaten their flank cetewayo gener did not leav us long in
doubt as to what thei would do the main bodi of their armi bore awai
to the right in pursuit of the fly foe but three regiment each
of about two thousand five hundr spear halt five minut pass
perhap while thei marshal with a distanc of some six hundr yard
between them each regiment wa in a tripl line like our own
to me that seem a veri long five minut but reflect that it wa
probabl my last on earth i tri to make the best of it in a fashion
that can be guess strang to sai howev i found it imposs to
keep my mind fix upon those matter with which it ought to have been
fill my ey and thought would roam i look at the rank of the
veteran amawomb and note that thei were still and solemn as men about
to die should be although thei show no sign of fear inde i
saw some of those near me pass their snuffbox to each other two
greyhair men also who evid were old friend shook hand as
peopl do who ar part befor a journei while two other discuss
in a low voic the possibl of our wipe out most of the usutu
befor we were wipe out ourselv
it depend said on of them whether thei attack us regiment by
regiment or all togeth as thei will do if thei ar wise
then an offic bade them be silent and convers ceas maputa
pass through the rank give order to the captain from a distanc
hi wither old bodi with a fight shield held in front of it
look like that of a huge black ant carri someth in it mouth he
came to where scowl and i sat upon our hors
ah i see that you ar readi macumazahn he said in a cheer voic
i told you that you should not go awai hungri did i not
maputa i said in remonstr what is the us of thi umbelazi is
defeat you ar not of hi impi why send all theseand i wave my
handdown into the dark why not go to the river and try to save
the women and children
becaus we shall take mani of those down into the dark with us
macumazahn and he point to the dens mass of the usutu yet he
ad with a touch of compunct thi is not your quarrel you and
your servant have hors slip out if you will and gallop hard to the
lower drift you mai get awai with your live
then my white man pride came to my aid
nai i answer i will not run while other stai to fight
i never thought you would macumazahn who i am sure do not wish to
earn a new and ugli name well neither will the amawomb run to becom
a mock among their peopl the king order were that we should try to
help umbelazi if the battl went against him we obei the king order
by dy where we stand macumazahn do you think that you could hit
that big fellow who is shout insult at us there if so i should be
oblig to you as i dislik him veri much and he show me a captain
who wa swagger about in front of the line of the first of the usutu
regiment about six hundr yard awai
i will try i answer but it a long shot dismount i climb
a pile of stone and rest my rifl on the topmost of them took
a veri full sight aim held my breath and press the trigger a
second afterward the shouter of insult threw hi arm wide let
fall hi spear and pitch forward on to hi face
a roar of delight rose from the watch amawomb while old maputa
clap hi thin brown hand and grin from ear to ear
thank you macumazahn a veri good omen now i am sure that whatev
those isigqosa dog of umbelazi mai do we king men shall make an
excel end which is all that we can hope oh what a beauti shot
it will be someth to think of when i am an idhlozi a spiritsnak
crawl about my own kraal farewel macumazahn and he took my
hand and press it the time ha come i go to lead the charg the
amawomb have order to defend you to the last for i wish you to see
the finish of thi fight farewel
then off he hurri follow by hi orderli and staffoffic
i never saw him again aliv though i think that onc in after year i
did meet hi idhlozi in hi kraal under strang circumst but that
ha noth to do with thi histori
as for me have reload i mount my hors again be afraid lest
if i went on shoot i should miss and spoil my reput besid
what wa the us of kill more men unless i wa oblig there were
plenti readi to do that
anoth minut and the regiment in front of us began to move while the
other two behind it ostentati sat themselv down in their rank
to show that thei did not mean to spoil sport the fight wa to begin
with a duel between about six thousand men
good mutter the warrior who wa nearest me thei ar in our bag
ay answer anoth those littl boi us as a term of
contempt ar go to learn their last lesson
for a few second there wa silenc while the long rank leant forward
between the hedg of lean and cruel spear a whisper went down the
line it sound like the nois of wind among tree and wa the signal
to prepar next a faroff voic shout some word which wa repeat
again and again by other voic befor and behind me i becam awar
that we were move quit slowli at first then more quickli be
lift abov the rank upon my hors i could see the whole advanc
and the gener aspect of it wa that of a tripl black wave each wave
crown with foamth white plume and shield of the amawomb were
the foamand aliv with sparkl of lighttheir broad spear were the
light
we were charg nowand oh the aw and gloriou excit of that
charg oh the rush of the bend plume and the dull thud of
eight thousand feet the usutu came up the slope to meet us in silenc
we went and in silenc thei came we drew near to each other now we
could see their face peer over the top of their mottl shield
and now we could see their fierc and roll ey
then a roara roll roar such as at that time i had never heard
the thunder of the roar of the meet shieldsand a flasha swift
simultan flash the flash of the lightn of the stab spear
up went the cry of
kill amawomb kill answer by anoth cry of
toss usutu toss
after that what happen heaven know aloneor at least i do not
but in later year mr osborn afterward the resid magistr at
newcastl in natal who be young and foolish in those dai had
swum hi hors over the tugela and hidden in a littl kopj quit near
to us in order to see the battl told me that it look as though
some huge breakerthat breaker be the splendid amawomberol in
toward the shore with the weight of the ocean behind it had suddenli
struck a ridg of rock and rear itself up submerg and hidden it
at least within three minut that usutu regiment wa no more we
had kill them everi on and from all along our line rose a fierc
hiss sound of sgee sgee zhi in the zulu utter as the
spear went home in the bodi of the conquer
that regiment had gone take nearli a third of our number with it for
in such a battl as thi the wound were as good as dead practic
our first line had vanish in a frai that did not last more than a few
minut befor it wa well over the second usutu regiment sprang up and
charg with a yell of victori we rush down the slope toward them
again there wa the roar of the meet shield but thi time the fight
wa more prolong and be in the front rank now i had my share of
it i rememb shoot two usutu who stab at me after which my gun
wa wrench from my hand i rememb the mle swing backward and
forward the groan of the wound the shout of victori and despair
and then scowl voic sai
we have beat them baa but here come the other
the third regiment wa on our shatter line we close up we fought
like devil even the bearer boi rush into the frai from all side
thei pour down upon us for we had made a ring everi minut men di
by hundr and though their number grew few not on of the amawomb
yield i wa fight with a spear now though how it came into my
hand i cannot rememb for certain i think howev i wrench it from
a man who rush at me and wa stab befor he could strike i kill
a captain with thi spear for as he fell i recognis hi face it wa
that of on of cetewayo companion to whom i had sold some cloth at
nodwengu the fallen were pile up quit thick around mew were us
them as a breastwork friend and foe togeth i saw scowl hors rear
into the air and fall he slip over it tail and next instant wa
fight at my side also with a spear mutter dutch and english
oath as he struck
beetj varm a littl hot beetj varm baa i heard him sai then
my hors scream aloud and someth hit me hard upon the headi
suppos it wa a thrown kerryaft which i rememb noth for a
while except a sensat of pass through the air
i came to myself again and found that i wa still on the hors which
wa ambl forward across the veld at a rate of about eight mile an
hour and that scowl wa cling to my stirrup leather and run at
my side he wa cover with blood so wa the hors and so wa i it
mai have been our own blood for all three were more or less wound or
it mai have been that of other i am sure i do not know but we were
a terribl sight i pull upon the rein and the hors stop among
some thorn scowl felt in the saddlebag and found a larg flask of
holland gin and waterhalf gin and half waterwhich he had place
there befor the battl he uncork and gave it to me i took a long
pull at the stuff that tast like verit nectar then hand it to
him who did likewis new life seem to flow into my vein whatev
teetotal mai sai alcohol is good at such a moment
where ar the amawomb i ask
all dead by now i think baa as we should be had not your hors
bolt wow but thei made a great fighton that will be told of thei
have carri those three regiment awai upon their spear
that good i said but where ar we go
to natal i hope baa i have had enough of the zulu for the present
the tugela is not far awai and we will swim it come on befor our
hurt grow stiff
so we went on till present we reach the crest of a rise of ground
overlook the river and there saw and heard dread thing for
beneath us those devilish usutu were massacr the fugit and the
campfollow these were be driven by the hundr to the edg of
the water there to perish on the bank or in the stream which wa
black with drown or drown form
and oh the sound well these i will not attempt to describ
keep up stream i said shortli and we struggl across a kind of
donga where onli a few wound men were hidden into a somewhat denser
patch of bush that had scarc been enter by the fly isigqosa
perhap becaus here the bank of the river were veri steep and
difficult also between them it water ran swiftli for thi wa abov
the drift
for a while we went on in safeti then suddenli i heard a nois a great
man plung past me break through the bush like a buffalo and came
to a halt upon a rock which overhung the tugela for the flood had
eaten awai the soil beneath
umbelazi said scowl and as he spoke we saw anoth man follow as
a wild dog follow a buck
saduko said scowl
i rode on i could not help ride on although i knew it would be safer
to keep awai i reach the edg of that big rock saduko and umbelazi
were fight there
in ordinari circumst strong and activ as he wa saduko would
have had no chanc against the most power zulu live but the princ
wa utterli exhaust hi side were go like a blacksmith bellow
or those of a fat eland bull that ha been gallop to a standstil
moreov he seem to me to be distraught with grief and lastli he
had no shield left noth but an assegai
a stab from saduko spear which he partial parri wound him
slightli on the head and cut loos the fillet of hi ostrich plume
that same plume which i had seen blown off in the morn so that
it fell to the ground anoth stab pierc hi right arm make
it helpless he snatch the assegai with hi left hand strive to
continu the fight and just at that moment we came up
what ar you do saduko i cri doe a dog bite hi own master
he turn and stare at me both of them stare at me
ay macumazahn he answer in an ici voic sometim when it is
starv and that fullf master ha snatch awai it bone nai stand
asid macumazahn for although i wa quit unarm i had step
between them lest you should share the fate of thi womanthief
not i saduko i cri for thi sight made me mad unless you murder
me
then umbelazi spoke in a hollow voic sob out hi word
i thank you white man yet do as thi snake bid youthi snake that
ha live in my kraal and fed out of my cup let him have hi fill of
vengeanc becaus of the woman who bewitch mey becaus of the
sorceress who ha brought me and thousand to the dust have you heard
macumazahn of the great deed of thi son of matiwan have you heard
that all the while he wa a traitor in the pai of cetewayo and that he
went over with the regiment of hi command to the usutu just when the
battl hung upon the turn come traitor here is my heartth heart
that love and trust you strikestrik hard
out of the wai macumazahn hiss saduko but i would not stir
he sprang at me and though i put up the best fight that i could in
my injur state got hi hand about my throat and began to choke
me scowl ran to help me but hi woundfor he wa hurtor hi utter
exhaust took effect on him or perhap it wa excit at ani
rate he fell down in a fit i thought that all wa over when again i
heard umbelazi voic and felt saduko grip loosen at my throat and
sat up
dog said the princ where is your assegai and as he spoke he
threw it from him into the river beneath for he had pick it up while
we struggl but as i note retain hi own now dog why do i not
kill you as would have been easi but now i will tell you becaus i
will not mix the blood of a traitor with my own see he set the haft
of hi broad spear upon the rock and bent forward over the blade you
and your witchwif have brought me to noth o saduko my blood and
the blood of all who clung to me is on your head your name shall
stink for ever in the nostril of all true men and i whom you have
betrayedi the princ umbelaziwil haunt you while you live ye
my spirit shall enter into you and when you dieah then well meet
again tell thi tale to the white men macumazahn my friend on whom
be honour and bless
he paus and i saw the tear gush from hi eyestear mingl
with blood from the wound in hi head then suddenli he utter the
battlecri of laba laba and let hi weight fall upon the point of
the spear
it pierc him through and through he fell on to hi hand and knee
he look up at usoh the piteous of that lookand then roll
sidewai from the edg of the rock
a heavi splash and that wa the end of umbelazi the fallenumbelazi
about whom mameena had cast her net
a sad stori in truth although it happen so mani year ago i weep as i
write iti weep as umbelazi wept
chapter xiv umbezi and the blood royal
after thi i think that some of the usutu came up for it seem to me
that i heard saduko sai
touch not macumazahn or hi servant thei ar my prison he who
harm them di with all hi hous
so thei put me faint on my hors and scowl thei carri awai upon
a shield
when i came to i found myself in a littl cave or rather beneath some
overhang rock at the side of a kopj and with me scowl who had
recov from hi fit but seem in a veri bewild condit
inde neither then nor afterward did he rememb anyth of the
death of umbelazi nor did i ever tell him that tale like mani other
he thought that the princ had been drown in try to swim the
tugela
ar thei go to kill us i ask of him sinc from the triumphant
shout without i knew that we must be in the midst of the victori
usutu
i dont know baa he answer i hope not after we have gone
through so much it would be a piti better to have di at the begin
of the battl
i nod my head in assent and just at that moment a zulu who had veri
evid been fight enter the place carri a dish of toast
lump of beef and a gourd of water
cetewayo send you these macumazahn he said and is sorri that
there is no milk or beer when you have eaten a guard wait without to
escort you to him and he went
well i said to scowl if thei were go to kill us thei would
scarc take the troubl to feed us first so let us keep up our heart
and eat
who know answer poor scowl as he cram a lump of beef into
hi big mouth still it is better to die on a full than on an empti
stomach
so we at and drank and as we were suffer more from exhaust than
from our hurt which were not realli seriou our strength came back
to us as we finish the last lump of meat which although it had been
onli half cook upon the point of an assegai tast veri good the
zulu put hi head into the mouth of the shelter and ask if we were
readi i nod and support each other scowl and i limp from the
place outsid were about fifti soldier who greet us with a shout
that although it wa mix with laughter at our pitiabl appear
struck me as not altogeth unfriendli amongst these men wa my hors
which stood with it head hang down look veri depress i wa
help on to it back and scowl cling to the stirrup leather we
were led a distanc of about a quarter of a mile to cetewayo
we found him seat in the full blaze of the even sun on the
eastern slope of on of the landwav of the veld with the open
plain in front of him it wa a strang and savag scene there sat the
victori princ surround by hi captain and induna while befor
him rush the triumphant regiment shout hi titl in the
most extravag languag izimbongi alsothat is profession
praiserswer run up and down befor him dress in all sort of
fineri tell hi deed call him eaterupoftheearth and
yell out the name of those great on who had been kill in the
battl
meanwhil parti of bearer were come up continu carri dead
men of distinct upon shield and lai them out in row as game
is laid out at the end of a dai shoot in england it seem that
cetewayo had taken a fanci to see them and be too tire to walk
over the field of battl order that thi should be done among these
by the wai i saw the bodi of my old friend maputa the gener of the
amawomb and note that it wa liter riddl with spear thrust
everi on of them in front also that hi quaint face still wore a
smile
at the head of these line of corps were laid six dead all men of
larg size in whom i recognis the brother of umbelazi who had
fought on hi side and the halfbroth of cetewayo among them were
those three princ upon whom the dust had fallen when zikali the
prophet smelt out masapo the husband of mameena
dismount from my hors with the help of scowl i limp through and
over the corps of these fallen royalti cut in the zulu fashion to
free their spirit which otherwis as thei believ would haunt the
slayer and stood in front of cetewayo
siyakubona macumazahn he said stretch out hi hand to me which
i took though i could not find it in my heart to wish him good dai
i hear that you were lead the amawomb whom my father the king
sent down to help umbelazi and i am veri glad that you have escap
aliv also my heart is proud of the fight that thei made for you know
macumazahn onc next to the king i wa gener of that regiment
though afterward we quarrel still i am pleas that thei did so
well and i have given order that everi on of them who remain aliv
is to be spare that thei mai be offic of a new amawomb which i
shall rais do you know macumazahn that you have nearli wipe out
three whole regiment of the usutu kill mani more peopl than did
all my brother armi the isigqosa oh you ar a great man had it
not been for the loyaltythi word wa spoken with just a ting of
sarcasmof saduko yonder you would have won the dai for umbelazi
well now that thi quarrel is finish if you will stai with me i
will make you gener of a whole divis of the king armi sinc
henceforth i shall have a voic in affair
you ar mistaken o son of panda i answer the splendour of the
amawomb great stand against a multitud is on the name of maputa the
king councillor and the induna of the black on chaka who is gone
he li yonder in hi glori and i point to maputa pierc bodi i
did but fight as a soldier in hi rank
oh ye we know that we know all that macumazahn and maputa wa a
clever monkei in hi wai but we know also that you taught him how to
jump well he is dead and nearli all the amawomb ar dead and of
my three regiment but a hand is left the vultur have the rest
of them that is all finish and forgotten macumazahn though by good
fortun the spear went wide of you who doubtless ar a magician sinc
otherwis you and your servant and your hors would not have escap
with a few scratch when everyon els wa kill but you did escap
as you have done befor in zululand and now you see here lie certain
men who were born of my father yet on is missingh against whom i
fought ay and he whom although we fought i love the best of all
of them now it ha been whisper in my ear that you alon know what
becam of him and macumazahn i would learn whether he live or is
dead also if he is dead by whose hand he di who would reward that
hand
now i look round me wonder whether i should tell the truth or
hold my tongu and as i look my ey met those of saduko who cold
and unconcern wa seat among the captain but at a littl distanc
from ani of thema man apart and i rememb that he and i alon knew
the truth of the end of umbelazi
why i do not know but it came into my mind that i would keep the
secret why should i tell the triumphant cetewayo that umbelazi had been
driven to die by hi own hand why should i lai bare saduko victori
and shame all these matter had pass into the court of a differ
tribun who wa i that i should reveal them or judg the actor of
thi terribl drama
o cetewayo i said as it chanc i saw the end of umbelazi no enemi
kill him he di of a broken heart upon a rock abov the river and
for the rest of the stori go ask the tugela into which he fell
for a moment cetewayo hid hi ey with hi hand
is it so he said present wow i sai again that had it not been
for saduko the son of matiwan yonder who had some quarrel with
indhlovuenesihlonti about a woman and took hi chanc of vengeanc
it might have been i who di of a broken heart upon a rock abov the
river oh saduko i ow you a great debt and will pai you well but you
shall be no friend of mine lest we also should chanc to quarrel about
a woman and i should find myself dy of a broken heart on a rock
abov a river o my brother umbelazi i mourn for you my brother for
after all we plai togeth when we were littl and love each other
onc who in the end fought for a toi that is call a throne sinc
as our father said two bull cannot live in the same yard my brother
well you ar gone and i remain yet who know but that at the last your
lot mai be happier than mine you di of a broken heart umbelazi but
of what shall i die i wonder
that histori of cetewayo fall and tragic death and of
zikali vengeanc i hope to write on dai for in these
event also i wa destin to plai a parta q
i have given thi interview in detail sinc it wa becaus of it that
the sai went abroad that umbelazi di of a broken heart
so in truth he did for befor hi spear pierc it hi heart wa
broken
now see that cetewayo wa in on of hi soft mood and that he
seem to look upon me kindli though i had fought against him i
reflect that thi would be a good opportun to ask hi leav to
depart to tell the truth my nerv were quit shatter with all i had
gone through and i long to be awai from the sight and sound of that
terribl battlefield on and about which so mani thousand peopl had
perish thi fate dai as i had seldom long for anyth befor
but while i wa make up my mind as to the best wai to approach him
someth happen which caus me to lose my chanc
hear a nois behind me i look round to see a stout man arrai
in a veri fine war dress and wave in on hand a gori spear and in the
other a headplum of ostrich feather who wa shout out
give me audienc of the son of the king i have a song to sing to the
princ i have a tale to tell to the conqueror cetewayo
i stare i rub my ey it could not bey it wasumbezi
eaterupofeleph the father of mameena in a few second
without wait for leav to approach he had bound through the line
of dead princ stop to kick on of them on the head and address
hi poor clai in some word of shame insult and wa pranc about
befor cetewayo shout hi prais
who is thi umfokazana that is low fellow growl the princ bid
him ceas hi nois and speak lest he should be silent for ever
o calf of the black cow i am umbezi eaterupofeleph chief
captain of saduko the cun he who won you the battl father of
mameena the beauti whom saduko wed and whom the dead dog umbelazi
stole awai from him
ah said cetewayo screw up hi ey in a fashion he had when
he meant mischief which among the zulu caus him to be name the
bullwhoshutshiseyestotoss and what have you to tell me
eaterupofeleph and father of mameena whom the dead dog
umbelazi took awai from your master saduko the cun
thi o mighti on thi o shaker of the earth that well am i name
eaterupofeleph who have eaten up indhlovuenesihlontith
eleph himself
now saduko seem to awak from hi brood and start from hi place
but cetewayo sharpli bade him be silent whereon umbezi the fool
note noth continu hi tale
o princ i met umbelazi in the battl and when he saw me he fled from
me ye hi heart grew soft as water at the sight of me the warrior
whom he had wrong whose daughter he had stolen
i hear you said cetewayo umbelazi heart turn to water at the
sight of you becaus he had wrong youyou who until thi morn
when you desert him with saduko were on of hi jackal well and
what happen then
he fled o lion with the black mane he fled like the wind and i i
flew after him likea stronger wind far into the bush he fled till at
length he came to a rock abov the river and wa oblig to stand then
there we fought he thrust at me but i leapt over hi spear thu
and he gambol into the air he thrust at me again but i bent myself
thu and he duck hi great head then he grew tire and my time
came he turn and ran round the rock and i i ran after him stab
him through the back thu and thu and thu till he fell
cry for merci and roll off the rock into the river and as he
roll i snatch awai hi plume see is it not the plume of the dead
dog umbelazi
cetewayo took the ornament and examin it show it to on or two of
the captain near him who nod their head grave
ye he said thi is the war plume of umbelazi belov of the king
strong and shine pillar of the great hous we know it well that war
plume at the sight of which mani a knee ha loosen and so you kill
him eaterupofeleph father of mameena you who thi morn
were on of the meanest of hi jackal now what reward shall i give
you for thi mighti deed o umbezi
a great reward o terribl on began umbezi but in an aw voic
cetewayo bade him be silent
ye he said a great reward hearken jackal and traitor your own
word bear wit against you you you have dare to lift your hand
against the bloodroy and with your foul tongu to heap li and
insult upon the name of the mighti dead
now understand at last umbezi began to babbl excus ye and to
declar that all hi tale wa fals hi fat cheek fell in he sank to
hi knee
but cetewayo onli spat toward the man after hi fashion when enrag
and look round him till hi ey fell upon saduko
saduko he said take awai thi slayer of the princ who boast that
he is red with my own blood and when he is dead cast him into the river
from that rock on which he sai he stab panda son
saduko look round him wildli and hesit
take him awai thunder cetewayo and return er dark to make report
to me
then at a sign from the princ soldier flung themselv upon the
miser umbezi and drag him thenc saduko go with them nor wa
the poor liar ever seen again as he pass by me he call to me for
mameena sake to save him but i could onli shake my head and bethink
me of the warn i had onc given to him as to the fate of traitor
it mai be said that thi stori come straight from the histori of saul
and david but i can onli answer that it happen circumst that
were not unlik end in a similar tragedi that is all what david
exact motiv were natur i cannot tell but it is easi to guess
those of cetewayo who although he could make war upon hi brother to
secur the throne did not think it wise to let it go abroad that the
royal blood might be lightli spilt also know that i wa a wit
of the princ death he wa well awar that umbezi wa but a
boast liar who hope thu to ingrati himself with an allpow
conqueror
well thi tragic incid had it sequel it seemsto hi honour be
it saidthat saduko refus to be the execution of hi fatherinlaw
umbezi so those with him perform thi offic and brought him back a
prison to cetewayo
when the princ learn that hi direct order spoken in the accustom
and fear formula of take him awai had been disobei hi rage
wa or seem to be great my own convict is that he wa onli
seek a caus of quarrel against saduko who he thought wa a veri
power man who would probabl treat him should opportun aris as
he had treat umbelazi and perhap now that the most of panda son
were dead except himself and the lad mtonga sikota and mkungo who
had fled into natal might even in futur dai aspir to the throne
as the husband of the king daughter still he wa afraid or did not
think it polit at onc to put out of hi path thi master of mani
legion who had plai so import a part in the battl therefor he
order him to be kept under guard and taken back to nodwengu that the
whole matter might be investig by panda the king who still rule
the land though henceforth onli in name also he refus to allow me to
depart into natal sai that i too must come to nodwengu as there
my testimoni might be need
so have no choic i went it be fate that i should see the end
of the drama
chapter xv mameena claim the kiss
when i reach nodwengu i wa taken ill and laid up in my wagon for
about a fortnight what my exact sick wa i do not know for i had
no doctor at hand to tell me as even the missionari had fled the
countri fever result from fatigu exposur and excit and
complic with fear headachecaus i presum by the blow which
i receiv in the battlewer it princip symptom
when i began to get better scowl and some zulu friend who came to see
me inform me that the whole land wa in a fear state of disord
and that umbelazi adher the isigqosa were still be hunt
out and kill it seem that it wa even suggest by some of the
usutu that i should share their fate but on thi point panda wa firm
inde he appear to have said publicli that whoever lift a spear
against me hi friend and guest lift it against him and would be
the caus of a new war so the usutu left me alon perhap becaus thei
were satisfi with fight for a while and thought it wisest to be
content with what thei had won
inde thei had won everyth for cetewayo wa now supremebi right
of the assegaiand hi father but a cipher although he remain the
head of the nation cetewayo wa publicli declar to be it feet
and strength wa in these activ feet not in the bow and sleep
head in fact so littl power wa left to panda that he could not
protect hi own household thu on dai i heard a great tumult and
shout proceed appar from the isigodhlo or royal enclosur
and on inquir what it wa afterward wa told that cetewayo had come
from the amangw kraal and denounc nomantshali the king wife
as umtakati or a witch more in spite of hi father prayer and
tear he had caus her to be put to death befor hi eyesa dread
and a savag deed at thi distanc of time i cannot rememb whether
nomantshali wa the mother of umbelazi or of on of the other fallen
princ
on reread thi histori it come back to me that she
wa the mother of mtonga who wa much younger than
umbelazi a q
a few dai later when i wa up and about again although i had not
ventur into the kraal panda sent a messeng to me with a present of
an ox on hi behalf thi man congratul me on my recoveri and told
me that whatev might have happen to other i wa to have no fear
for my own safeti he ad that cetewayo had sworn to the king that not
a hair of my head should be harm in these word
had i wish to kill watcherbynight becaus he fought against me i
could have done so down at endondakusuka but then i ought to kill you
also my father sinc you sent him thither against hi will with your
own regiment but i like him well who is brave and who brought me good
tide that the princ my enemi wa dead of a broken heart moreov
i wish to have no quarrel with the white hous the english on account
of macumazahn so tell him that he mai sleep in peac
the messeng said further that saduko the husband of the king
daughter nandi and umbelazi chief induna wa to be put upon hi
trial on the morrow befor the king and hi council togeth with
mameena daughter of umbezi and that my presenc wa desir at thi
trial
i ask what wa the charg against them he repli that so far as
saduko wa concern there were two first that he had stir up
civil war in the land and secondli that have push on umbelazi
into a fight in which mani thousand perish he had plai the
traitor desert him in the midst of the battl with all hi
followinga veri heinou offenc in the ey of zulu to whatev
parti thei mai belong
against mameena there were three count of indict first that it
wa she who had poison saduko child and other not masapo her
first husband who had suffer for that crime secondli that she had
desert saduko her second husband and gone to live with anoth man
name the late princ umbelazi thirdli that she wa a witch who had
enmesh umbelazi in the web of her sorceri and therebi caus him to
aspir to the success to the throne to which he had no right and
made the isililo or cry of mourn for the dead to be heard in everi
kraal in zululand
with three such pitfal in her narrow path mameena will have to walk
carefulli if she would escap them all i said
ye inkoosi especi as the pitfal ar dug from side to side of
the path and have a point stake set at the bottom of each of them oh
mameena is alreadi as good as dead as she deserv to be who without
doubt is the greatest umtakati north of the tugela
i sigh for somehow i wa sorri for mameena though why she should
escap when so mani better peopl had perish becaus of her i did not
know and the messeng went on
the black on that is panda sent me to tell saduko that he would be
allow to see you macumazahn befor the trial if he wish for he
knew that you had been a friend of hi and thought that you might be
abl to give evid in hi favour
and what did saduko sai to that i ask
he said that he thank the king but that it wa not need for him
to talk with macumazahn whose heart wa white like hi skin and whose
lip if thei spoke at all would tell neither more nor less than the
truth the princess nandi who is with himfor she will not leav
him in hi troubl as all other have doneon hear these word of
saduko said that thei were true and that for thi reason although
you were her friend she did not hold it necessari to see you either
upon thi intim i made no comment but my head thought as the
nativ sai that saduko real reason for not wish to see me wa
that he felt asham to do so and nandi that she fear to learn
more about her husband perfidi than she knew alreadi
with mameena it is otherwis went on the messeng for as soon
as she wa brought here with zikali the littl and wise with whom it
seem she ha been shelter and learn that you macumazahn were
at the kraal she ask leav to see you
and is it grant i broke in hurriedli for i did not at all wish for
a privat interview with mameena
nai have no fear inkoosi repli the messeng with a smile it
is refus becaus the king said that if onc she saw you she would
bewitch you and bring troubl on you as she doe on all men it is for
thi reason that she is guard by women onli no man be allow to
go near to her for on women her witcheri will not bite still thei
sai that she is merri and laugh and sing a great deal declar that
her life ha been dull up at old zikali and that now she is go to
a place as gai as the veld in spring after the first warm rain where
there will be plenti of men to quarrel for her and make her great and
happi that is what she sai the witch who know perhap what the place
of spirit is like
then as i made no remark or suggest the messeng depart
sai that he would return on the morrow to lead me to the place of
trial
next morn after the cow had been milk and the cattl loos from
their kraal he came accordingli with a guard of about thirti men all
of them soldier who had surviv the great fight of the amawomb these
warrior some of whom had wound that were scarc heal salut me
with loud cri of inkoosi and baba as i step out of the wagon
where i had spent a wretch night of unpleas anticip show
me that there were at least some zulu with whom i remain popular
inde their delight at see me whom thei look upon as a comrad
and on of the few survivor of the great adventur wa quit touch
as we went which we did slowli their captain told me of their fear
that i had been kill with the other and how rejoic thei were when
thei learn that i wa safe he told me also that after the third
regiment had attack them and broken up their ring a small bodi of
them from eighti to a hundr onli manag to cut a wai through and
escap run not toward the tugela where so mani thousand had
perish but up to nodwengu where thei report themselv to panda as
the onli survivor of the amawomb
and ar you safe now i ask of the captain
oh ye he answer you see we were the king men not
umbelazi so cetewayo bear us no grudg inde he is oblig to us
becaus we gave the usutu their stomach full of good fight which
is more than did those cow of umbelazi it is toward saduko that
he bear a grudg for you know my father on should never pull a
drown man out of the streamwhich is what saduko did for had it not
been for hi treacheri cetewayo would have sunk beneath the water of
deathespeci if it is onli to spite a woman who hate him still
perhap saduko will escap with hi life becaus he is nandi
husband and cetewayo fear nandi hi sister if he doe not love her
but here we ar and those who have to watch the sky all dai will be
abl to tell of the even weather in other word those who live
will learn
as he spoke we pass into the privat enclosur of the isigohlo
outsid of which a great mani peopl were gather shout talk
and quarrel for in those dai all the usual disciplin of the great
place wa relax within the fenc howev that wa strongli guard
on it exterior side were onli about a score of councillor the
king the princ cetewayo who sat upon hi right the princess nandi
saduko wife a few attend two great silent fellow arm with
club whom i guess to be execution and seat in the shade in a
corner that ancient dwarf zikali though how he came to be there i did
not know
obvious the trial wa to be quit a privat affair which account
for the unusu presenc of the two slayer even my amawomb guard
wa left outsid the gate although i wa significantli inform that if
i chose to call upon them thei would hear me which wa anoth wai of
sai that in such a small gather i wa absolut safe
walk forward boldli toward panda who though he wa as fat as ever
look veri worn and much older than when i had last seen him i made
my bow whereon he took my hand and ask after my health then i shook
cetewayo hand also as i saw that it wa stretch out to me he
seiz the opportun to remark that he wa told that i had suffer
a knock on the head in some scrimmag down by the tugela and he hope
that i felt no ill effect i answer no though i fear that there
were a few other who had not been so fortun especi those who
had stumbl against the amawomb regiment with whom i chanc to be
travel upon a peac mission of inquiri
it wa a bold speech to make but i wa determin to give him a
quid pro quo and as a matter of fact he took it in veri good part
laugh heartili at the joke
after thi i salut such of the councillor present as i knew which
wa not mani for most of my old friend were dead and sat down upon
the stool that wa place for me not veri far from the dwarf zikali who
stare at me in a stoni fashion as though he had never seen me befor
there follow a paus then at some sign from panda a side gate in
the fenc wa open and through it appear saduko who walk
proudli to the space in front of the king to whom he gave the salut
of bayt and at a sign sat himself down upon the ground next
through the same gate to which she wa conduct by some women came
mameena quit unchang and i think more beauti than she had ever
been so love did she look inde in her cloak of grei fur her
necklet of blue bead and the gleam ring of copper which she wore
upon her wrist and ankl that everi ey wa fix upon her as she
glide gracefulli forward to make her obeis to panda
thi done she turn and saw nandi to whom she also bow as she
did so inquir after the health of her child without wait for an
answer which she knew would not be vouchsaf she advanc to me and
grasp my hand which she press warmli sai how glad she wa to
see me safe after go through so mani danger though she thought i
look even thinner than i us to be
onli of saduko who wa watch her with hi intent and melancholi
ey she took no heed whatsoev inde for a while i thought that
she could not have seen him nor did she appear to recognis cetewayo
although he stare at her hard enough but as her glanc fell upon the
two execution i thought i saw her shudder like a shaken reed then
she sat down in the place appoint to her and the trial began
the case of saduko wa taken first an offic learn in zulu
lawwhich i can assur the reader is a veri intric and
wellestablish lawi suppos that he might be call a kind of
attorneygener rose and state the case against the prison he told
how saduko from a nobodi had been lift to a great place by the
king and given hi daughter the princess nandi in marriag then he
alleg that as would be prove in evid the said saduko had urg
on umbelazi the princ to whose parti he had attach himself to
make war upon cetewayo thi war have begun at the great battl of
endondakusuka he had treacher desert umbelazi togeth with
three regiment under hi command and gone over to cetewayo therebi
bring umbelazi to defeat and death
thi brief statement of the case for the prosecut be finish
panda ask saduko whether he plead guilti or not guilti
guilti o king he answer and wa silent
then panda ask him if he had anyth to sai in excus of hi conduct
noth o king except that i wa umbelazi man and when you o
king had given the word that he and the princ yonder might fight i
like mani other some of whom ar dead and some aliv work for him
with all my ten finger that he might have the victori
then why did you desert my son the princ in the battl ask panda
becaus i saw that the princ cetewayo wa the stronger bull and wish
to be on the win side as all men dofor no other reason answer
saduko calmli
now everyon present stare not except cetewayo panda who
like the rest of us had heard a veri differ tale look extrem
puzzl while zikali in hi corner set up on of hi great laugh
after a long paus at length the king as suprem judg began to pass
sentenc at least i suppos that wa hi intent but befor three
word had left hi lip nandi rose and said
my father er you speak that which cannot be unspoken hear me it is
well known that saduko my husband wa my brother umbelazi gener
and councillor and if he is to be kill for cling to the princ
then i should be kill also and countless other in zululand who still
remain aliv becaus thei were not in or escap the battl it is well
known also my father that dure that battl saduko went over to
my brother cetewayo though whether thi brought about the defeat of
umbelazi i cannot sai why did he go over he tell you becaus he
wish to be on the win side it is not true he went over in order
to be reveng upon umbelazi who had taken from him yonder witchand
she point with her finger at mameenayond witch whom he love and
still love and whom even now he would shield even though to do so
he must make hi own name shame saduko sin i do not deni it
my father but there sit the real traitress red with the blood of
umbelazi and with that of thousand of other who have tshonil
gone down to keep him compani among the ghost therefor o king i
beseech you spare the life of saduko my husband or if he must die
learn that i your daughter will die with him i have spoken o king
and veri proudli and quietli she sat herself down again wait for the
fate word
but those word were not spoken sinc panda onli said let us try the
case of thi woman mameena
thereon the law offic rose again and set out the charg against
mameena name that it wa she who had poison saduko child and
not masapo that after marri saduko she had desert him and gone
to live with the princ umbelazi and that final she had bewitch the
said umbelazi and caus him to make civil war in the land
the second charg if prove name that thi woman desert her
husband for anoth man is a crime of death broke in panda abruptli
as the offic finish speak therefor what need is there to hear
the first and the third until that is examin what do you plead to
that charg woman
now understand that the king did not wish to stir up these other
matter of murder and witchcraft for some reason of hi own we all
turn to hear mameena answer
o king she said in her low silveri voic i cannot deni that i left
saduko for umbelazi the handsom ani more than saduko can deni that he
left umbelazi the beaten for cetewayo the conqueror
why did you leav saduko ask panda
o king perhap becaus i love umbelazi for wa he not call the
handsom also you know that the princ your son wa on to be
love here she paus look at poor panda who winc or
perhap becaus i wish to be great for wa he not of the blood
royal and had it not been for saduko would he not on dai have been a
king or perhap becaus i could no longer bear the treatment that the
princess nandi dealt out to me she who wa cruel to me and threaten
to beat me becaus saduko love my hut better than her own ask
saduko he know more of these matter than i do and she gaze at him
steadili then she went on how can a woman tell her reason o king
when she never know them herselfa question at which some of her
hearer smile
now saduko rose and said slowli
hear me o king and i will give the reason that mameena hide she
left me for umbelazi becaus i bade her to do so for i knew that
umbelazi desir her and i wish to tie the cord tighter which bound
me to on who at that time i thought would inherit the throne also
i wa weari of mameena who quarrel night and dai with the princess
nandi my inkosikazi
now nandi gasp in astonish and so did i but mameena laugh
and said
ye o king those were the two real reason that i had forgotten i
left saduko becaus he bade me as he wish to make a present to the
princ also he wa tire of me for mani dai at a time he would
scarc speak to me becaus howev kind she might be i could not
help quarrel with the princess nandi moreov there wa anoth
reason which i have forgotten i had no child and not have ani
child i did not think it matter whether i went or stai if saduko
search he will rememb that i told him so and that he agre with
me
again she look at saduko who said hurriedli
ye ye i told her so i told her that i wish for no barren cow in
my kraal
now some of the audienc laugh outright but panda frown
it seem he said that my ear ar be stuf with li though
which of these two tell them i cannot sai well if the woman left the
man by hi own wish and that hi end might be further as he sai
he had put her awai and therefor the fault if ani is hi not her
so that charg is end now woman what have you to tell us of the
witchcraft which it is said you practis upon the princ who is gone
therebi caus him to make war in the land
littl that you would wish to hear o king or that it would be seemli
for me to speak she answer droop her head modestli the onli
witchcraft that ever i practis upon umbelazi li hereand she
touch her beauti eyesand hereand she touch her curv
lipsand in thi poor shape of mine which some have thought so fair
as for the war what had i to do with war who never spoke to umbelazi
who wa so dear to meand she look up with tear run down her
facesav of love o king is there a man among you all who would
fear the witcheri of such a on as i and becaus the heaven made me
beauti with the beauti that men must follow am i also to be kill
as a sorceress
now to thi argument neither panda nor anyon els seem to find an
answer especi as it wa well known that umbelazi had cherish hi
ambit to the success long befor he met mameena so that charg
wa drop and the first and greatest of the three proceed with
name that it wa she mameena and not her husband masapo who had
murder nandi child
when thi accus wa made against her for the first time i saw a
littl shade of troubl flit across mameena soft ey
sure o king she said that matter wa settl long ago when the
ndwand zikali the great nyanga smelt out masapo the wizard he who
wa my husband and brought him to hi death for thi crime must i then
be tri for it again
not so woman answer panda all that zikali smelt out wa the
poison that wrought the crime and as some of that poison wa found upon
masapo he wa kill as a wizard yet it mai be that it wa not he who
us the poison
then sure the king should have thought of that befor he di
murmur mameena but i forget it is known that masapo wa alwai
hostil to the hous of senzangakona
to thi remark panda made no answer perhap becaus it wa
unanswer even in a land where it wa customari to kill the suppos
wizard first and inquir as to hi actual guilt afterward or not at
all or perhap he thought it polit to ignor the suggest that he
had been inspir by person enmiti onli he look at hi daughter
nandi who rose and said
have i leav to call a wit on thi matter of the poison my
father
panda nod whereon nandi said to on of the councillor
be pleas to summon my woman nahana who wait without
the man went and present return with an elderli femal who it
appear had been nandi nurs and never have marri ow to
some physic defect had alwai remain in her servic a person well
known and much respect in her humbl walk of life
nahana said nandi you ar brought here that you mai repeat to the
king and hi council a tale which you told to me as to the come of
a certain woman into my hut befor the death of my firstborn son and
what she did there sai first is thi woman present here
ay inkosazana answer nahana yonder she sit who could mistak
her and she point to mameena who wa listen to everi word
intent as a dog listen at the mouth of an antbear hole when the
beast is stir beneath
then what of the woman and her deed ask panda
onli thi o king two night befor the child that is dead wa taken
ill i saw mameena creep into the hut of the ladi nandi i who wa
asleep alon in a corner of the big hut out of reach of the light of the
fire at the time the ladi nandi wa awai from the hut with her son
know the woman for mameena the wife of masapo who wa on friendli
term with the inkosazana whom i suppos she had come to visit i did
not declar myself nor did i take ani particular note when i saw her
sprinkl a littl mat upon which the babe saduko son wa wont to
be laid with some medicin becaus i had heard her promis to the
inkosazana a powder which she said would drive awai insect onli when
i saw her throw some of thi powder into the vessel of warm water that
stood by the fire to be us for the wash of the child and place
someth mutter certain word that i could not catch in the straw
of the doorwai i thought it strang and wa about to question her when
she left the hut as it happen o king but a littl while afterward
befor on could count ten ten inde a messeng came to the hut to
tell me that my old mother lai dy at her kraal four dai journei
from nodwengu and prai to see me befor she di then i forgot all
about mameena and the powder and run out to seek the princess
nandi i crave her leav to go with the messeng to my mother
kraal which she grant to me sai that i need not return until my
mother wa buri
so i went but oh my mother took long to die whole moon pass
befor i shut her ey and all thi while she would not let me go nor
inde did i wish to leav her whom i love at length it wa over and
then came the dai of mourn and after those some more dai of rest
and after them again the dai of the divis of the cattl so that in
the end six moon or more had gone by befor i return to the servic
of the princess nandi and found that mameena wa now the second wife
of the lord saduko also i found that the child of the ladi nandi wa
dead and that masapo the first husband of mameena had been smelt out
and kill as the murder of the child but as all these thing were
over and done with and as mameena wa veri kind to me give me gift
and spare me task and as i saw that saduko my lord love her much
it never came into my head to sai anyth of the matter of the powder
that i saw her sprinkl on the mat
after she had run awai with the princ who is dead howev i did tell
the ladi nandi moreov the ladi nandi in my presenc search
in the straw of the doorwai of the hut and found there wrap in soft
hide certain medicin such as the nyanga sell wherewith those who
consult them can bewitch their enemi or caus those whom thei desir
to love them or to hate their wive or husband that is all i know of
the stori o king
do my ear hear a true tale nandi ask panda or is thi woman a
liar like other
i think not my father see here is the muti medicin which nahana
and i found hid in the doorwai of the hut that i have kept unopen till
thi dai
and she laid on the ground a littl leather bag veri neatli sewn with
sinew and fasten round it neck with a fibr string
panda direct on of the councillor to open the bag which the man
did unwillingli enough sinc evid he fear it evil influenc
pour out it content on to the back of a hide shield which wa
then carri round so that we might all look at them these so far as
i could see consist of some wither root a small piec of human
thigh bone such as might have come from the skeleton of an infant that
had a littl stopper of wood in it orific and what i took to be the
fang of a snake
panda look at them and shrank awai sai
come hither zikali the old you who ar skill in magic and tell us
what is thi medicin
then zikali rose from the corner where he had been sit so silent
and waddl heavili across the open space to where the shield lai in
front of the king as he pass mameena she bent down over the dwarf
and began to whisper to him swiftli but he place hi hand upon hi
big head cover up hi ear as i suppos that he might not hear her
word
what have i to do with thi matter o king he ask
much it seem o openerofroad said panda sternli see that
you were the doctor who smelt out masapo and that it wa in your kraal
that yonder woman hid herself while her lover the princ my son who
is dead went down to the battl and that she wa brought thenc with
you tell us now the natur of thi muti and be wise as you ar
be care to tell us truli lest it should be said o zikali that you
ar not a nyanga onli but an umtakati as well for then he ad with
mean and choos hi word carefulli perchanc o zikali i might
be tempt to make trial of whether or no it is true that you cannot
be kill like other men especi as i have heard of late that your
heart is evil toward me and my hous
for a moment zikali hesitatedi think to give hi quick brain time
to work for he saw hi great danger then he laugh in hi dread
fashion and said
oho the king think that the otter is in the trap and he glanc
at the fenc of the isigohlo and at the fierc execution who stood
watch him sternli well mani time befor ha thi otter seem to
be in a trap ye er your father saw light o son of senzangakona
and after it also yet here he stand live make no trial o king of
whether or no i be mortal lest if death should come to such a on as i
he should take mani other with him also have you not heard the sai
that when the openerofroad come to the end of hi road there will be
no more a king of the zulu as when he began hi road there wa no king
of the zulu sinc the dai of hi manhood ar the dai of all the
zulu king
thu he spoke glare at panda and at cetewayo who shrank befor hi
gaze
rememb he went on that the black on who is gone down long ago
the wild beast who father the zulu herd threaten him whom he name
the thingthatshouldnothavebeenborn ay and slew those whom he
love and afterward wa slain by other who also ar gone down
and that you alon o panda did not threaten him and that you alon
o panda have not been slain now if you would make trial of whether i
die as other men die bid your dog fall on for zikali is readi and
he fold hi arm and wait
inde all of us wait breathlessli for we understood that the
terribl dwarf wa match himself against panda and cetewayo and
defi them both present it becam obviou that he had won the game
sinc panda onli said
why should i slai on whom i have befriend in the past and why do
you speak such heavi word of death in my ear o zikali the wise
which of late have heard so much of death he sigh ad be
pleas now to tell us of thi medicin or if you will not go and i
will send for other nyanga
why should i not tell you when you ask me softli and without threat
o king seeand zikali took up some of the twist rootsthes ar
the root of a certain poison herb that bloom at night on the top
of mountain and woe be to the ox that eat thereof thei have been
boil in gall and blood and ill will befal the hut in which thei ar
hidden by on who can speak the word of power thi is the bone of a
babe that ha never live to cut it teethi think of a babe that wa
left to die alon in the bush becaus it wa hate or becaus none
would father it such a bone ha strength to work ill against other
babe moreov it is fill with a charm medicin look and
pull out the plug of wood he scatter some grei powder from the
bone then stop it up again thi he ad pick up the fang
is the tooth of a deadli serpent that after it ha been doctor is
us by women to chang the heart of a man from anoth to herself i
have spoken
and he turn to go
stai said the king who set these foul charm in the doorwai of
saduko hut
how can i tell o king unless i make prepar and cast the bone
and smell out the evildo you have heard the stori of the woman
nahana accept it or reject it as your heart tell you
if that stori be true o zikali how come it that you yourself smelt
out not mameena the wife of masapo but masapo her husband himself
and caus him to be slain becaus of the poison of the child of
nandi
you err o king i zikali smelt out the hous of masapo then i
smelt out the poison search for it first in the hair of mameena and
find it in the kaross of masapo i never smelt out that it wa masapo
who gave the poison that wa the judgment of you and of your council
o king nai i knew well that there wa more in the matter and had you
paid me anoth fee and bade me to continu to us my wisdom without
doubt i should have found thi magic stuff hidden in the hut and mayhap
have learn the name of the hider but i wa weari who am veri old
and what wa it to me if you chose to kill masapo or chose to let him
go masapo who be your secret enemi wa a man who deserv to
dieif not for thi matter then for other
now all thi while i had been watch mameena who sat in the zulu
fashion listen to thi deadli evid a slight smile upon her
face and without attempt ani interrupt or comment onli i saw
that while zikali wa examin the medicin her ey were seek
the ey of saduko who remain in hi place also silent and to all
appear the least interest of anyon present he tri to avoid
her glanc turn hi head uneasili but at length her ey caught hi
and held them then hi heart began to beat quickli hi breast heav
and on hi face there grew a look of dreami content even of happi
from that moment forward till the end of the scene saduko never took
hi ey off thi strang woman though i think that with the except
of the dwarf zikali who saw everyth and of myself who am train
to observ none note thi curiou byplai of the drama
the king began to speak mameena he said you have heard have
you aught to sai for if not it would seem that you ar a witch and a
murderess and on who must die
yea a littl word o king she answer quietli nahana speak
truth it is true that i enter the hut of nandi and set the medicin
there i sai it becaus by natur i am not on who hide the truth or
would attempt to throw discredit even upon a humbl servingwoman and
she glanc at nahana
then from between your own teeth it is finish said panda
not altogeth o king i have said that i set the medicin in the hut
i have not said and i will not sai how and why i set it there that
tale i call upon saduko yonder to tell to you he who wa my husband
that i left for umbelazi and who be a man must therefor hate me
by the word he sai i will abid if he declar that i am guilti then
i am guilti and prepar to pai the price of guilt but if he declar
that i am innoc then o king and o princ cetewayo without fear
i trust myself to your just now speak o saduko speak the whole
truth whatev it mai be if that is the king will
it is my will said panda
and mine also ad cetewayo who i could see like everyon els
wa much interest in thi matter
saduko rose to hi feet the same saduko that i had alwai known and
yet so chang all the life and fire had gone from him hi pride
in himself wa no more none could have known him for that ambiti
confid man who in hi dai of power the zulu name the
selfeat he wa a mere mask of the old saduko inform by some
new some alien spirit with dull lacklustr ey fix alwai upon
the love ey of mameena in slow and hesit tone he began hi
tale
it is true o lion he said that mameena spread the poison upon my
child mat it is true that she set the deadli charm in the doorwai of
nandi hut these thing she did not know what she did and it wa
i who instruct her to do them thi is the case from the begin i
have alwai love mameena as i have love no other woman and as no other
woman wa ever love but while i wa awai with macumazahn who sit
yonder to destroi bangu chief of the amakoba he who had kill my
father umbezi the father of mameena he whom the princ cetewayo gave
to the vultur the other dai becaus he had li as to the death of
umbelazi he i sai forc mameena against her will to marri masapo

and while he live to him i will be true then o king i took counsel
with the evil in my heart and made a plot in myself to be rid of the
boar masapo so that when he wa dead i might marri mameena thi
wa the plot that i madethat my son and princess nandi should be
poison and that masapo should seem to poison him so that he might be
kill as a wizard and i marri mameena
now at thi astound statement which wa someth beyond the
experi of the most cun and cruel savag present there a gasp of
astonish went up from the audienc even old zikali lift hi head
and stare nandi too shaken out of her usual calm rose as though
to speak then look first at saduko and next at mameena sat herself
down again and wait but saduko went on again in the same cold
measur voic
i gave mameena a powder which i had bought for two heifer from a great
doctor who live beyond the tugela but who is now dead which powder
i told her wa desir by nandi my inkosikazi to destroi the littl
beetl than ran about the hut and direct her where she wa to spread
it also i gave her the bag of medicin tell her to thrust it into
the doorwai of the hut that it might bring a bless upon my hous
these thing she did ignorantli to pleas me not know that the
powder wa poison not know that the medicin wa bewitch so
my child di as i wish it to die and inde i myself fell sick
becaus by accid i touch the powder
afterward masapo wa smelt out as a wizard by old zikali i have
caus a bag of the poison to be sewn in hi kaross in order to deceiv
zikali and kill by your order o king and mameena wa given to me as
a wife also by your order o king which wa what i desir later on
as i have told you i weari of her and wish to pleas the princ
who ha wander awai i command her to yield herself to him which
mameena did out of her love for me and to advanc my fortun she who
is blameless in all thing
saduko finish speak and sat down again as an automaton might do
when a wire is pull hi lacklustr ey still fix upon mameena
face
you have heard o king said mameena now pass judgment know
that if it be your will i am readi to die for saduko sake
but panda sprang up in a rage
take him awai he said point to saduko take awai that dog who
is not fit to live a dog who eat hi own child that therebi he mai
caus anoth to be slain unjustli and steal hi wife
the execution leapt forward and have someth to sai for i
could bear thi busi no longer i began to rise to my feet befor i
gain them howev zikali wa speak
o king he said it seem that you have kill on man unjustli on
thi matter name masapo would you do the same by anoth and he
point to saduko
what do you mean ask panda angrili have you not heard thi
low fellow whom i made great give him the rule over tribe and my
daughter in marriag confess with hi own lip that he murder hi
child the child of my blood in order that he might eat a fruit
which grew by the roadsid for all men to nibbl at and he glare at
mameena
ay child of senzangakona answer zikali i heard saduko sai thi
with hi own lip but the voic that spoke from the lip wa not the
voic of saduko as were you a skill nyanga like me you would
have known as well as i do and as well as doe the white man
watcherbynight who is a reader of heart
hearken now o king and you great on around the king and i will
tell you a stori matiwan the father of saduko wa my friend as he
wa your o king and when bangu slew him and hi peopl by leav of
the wild beast chaka i save the child hi son ay and brought him
up in my own hous have learn to love him then when he becam a
man i the openerofroad show him two road down either of which
he might choos to walkth road of wisdom and the road of war and
women the white road that run through peac to knowledg and the red
road that run through blood to death
but alreadi there stood on upon thi red road who beckon him she
who sit yonder and he follow after her as i knew he would from
the begin she wa fals to him take a richer man for her husband
then when saduko grew great she grew sorri and came to ask my counsel
as to how she might be rid of masapo whom she swore she hate i told
her that she could leav him for anoth man or wait till her spirit
move him from her path but i never put evil into her heart see
that it wa there alreadi
then she and no other have first made saduko love her more than
ever murder the child of nandi hi inkosikazi and so brought
about the death of masapo and crept into saduko arm here
she slept a while till a new shadow fell upon her that of the
elephantwiththetuftofhair who will walk the wood no more him
she beguil that she might grow great the quicker and left the hous
of saduko take hi heart with her she who wa destin to be the
doom of men
now into saduko breast where hi heart had been enter an evil
spirit of jealousi and of reveng and in the battl of endondakusuka
that spirit rode him as a white man ride a hors as he had arrang
to do with the princ cetewayo yondernai deni it not o princ for i
know all did you not make a bargain togeth on the third night befor
the battl among the bush and start apart when the buck leapt out
between you here cetewayo who had been about to speak threw the
corner of hi kaross over hi face as he had arrang to do i sai
he went over with hi regiment from the isigqosa to the usutu and so
brought about the fall of umbelazi and the death of mani thousand ye
and thi he did for on reason onlybecaus yonder woman had left him
for the princ and he care more for her than for all the world could
give him for her who had fill him with mad as a bowl is fill
with milk and now o king you have heard thi man tell you a stori
you have heard him shout out that he is viler than ani man in all the
land that he murder hi own child the child he love so well to win
thi witch that afterward he gave her to hi friend and lord to bui
more of hi favour and that lastli he desert that lord becaus he
thought that there wa anoth lord from whom he could bui more favour
is it not so o king
it is so answer panda and therefor must saduko be thrown out to
the jackal
wait a while o king i sai that saduko ha spoken not with hi own
voic but with the voic of mameena i sai that she is the greatest
witch in all the land and that she ha drug him with the medicin
of her ey so that he know not what he sai even as she drug the
princ who is dead
then prove it or he di exclaim the king
now the dwarf went to panda and whisper in hi ear whereon panda
whisper in turn into the ear of two of hi councillor these men
who were unarm rose and made as though to leav the isigohlo but
as thei pass mameena on of them suddenli threw hi arm about her
pinion her arm the other tear off the kaross he worefor the
weather wa coldflung it over her head and knot it behind her so
that she wa hidden except for her ankl and feet then although she
did not move or struggl thei caught hold of her and stood still
now zikali hobbl to saduko and bade him rise which he did then he
look at him for a long while and made certain movement with hi hand
befor hi face after which saduko utter a great sigh and stare
about him
saduko said zikali i prai you tell me your fosterfath whether
it is true as men sai that you sold your wife mameena to the princ
umbelazi in order that hi favour might fall on you like heavi rain
wow zikali said saduko with a start of rage if were you as other
ar i would kill you you toad who dare to spit slander on my name
she ran awai with the princ have beguil him with the magic of her
beauti
strike me not saduko went on zikali or at least wait to strike
until you have answer on more question is it true as men sai that
in the battl of endondakusuka you went over to the usutu with your
regiment becaus you thought that indhlovuenesihlonti would be
beaten and wish to be on the side of him who won
what toad more slander cri saduko i went over for on reason
onlyto be reveng upon the princ becaus he had taken from me
her who wa more to me than life or honour ay and when i went over
umbelazi wa win it wa becaus i went that he lost and di as i
meant that he should die though now he ad sadli i would that i
had not brought him to ruin and the dust who think that like myself
he wa but wet clai in a woman finger
o king he ad turn to panda kill me i prai you who am not
worthi to live sinc to him whose hand is red with the blood of hi
friend death alon is left who while he breath must share hi
sleep with ghost that watch him with their angri ey
then nandi sprang up and said
nai father listen not to him who is mad and therefor holi
what he ha done he ha done who as he ha said wa but a tool in
anoth hand as for our babe i know well that he would have di
sooner than harm it for he love it much and when it wa taken awai
for three whole dai and night he wept and would touch no food give
thi poor man to me my fatherto me hi wife who love himand let

the zulu suppos that insan peopl ar inspir
aq
be silent daughter said the king and you o zikali the nyanga be

hand whereon the two councillor lift the kaross from off mameena
who look about her calmli and ask if she were take part in some
child game
ay woman answer panda you ar take part in a great game but
not i think such as is plai by childrena game of life and death
now have you heard the tale of zikali the littl and wise and the
word of saduko who wa onc your husband or must thei be repeat to
you
there is no need o king my ear ar too quick to be muffl by a fur
bag and i would not wast your time
then what have you to sai woman
not much she answer with a shrug of her shoulder except that i
have lost in thi game you will not believ me but if you had left me
alon i should have told you so who did not wish to see that poor fool
saduko kill for deed he had never done still the tale he told you
wa not told becaus i had bewitch him it wa told for love of me
whom he desir to save it wa zikali yonder zikali the enemi of your
hous who in the end will destroi your hous o son of senzangakona
that bewitch him as he ha bewitch you all and forc the truth
out of hi unwil heart
now what more is there to sai veri littl as i think i did the
thing that ar laid to my charg and wors thing which have not been
state oh i plai for great stake i who meant to be the inkosazana
of the zulu and as it chanc by the weight of a hair i have lost
i thought that i had count everyth but the hair weight which
turn the balanc against me wa the mad jealousi of thi fool saduko
upon which i had not reckon i see now that when i left saduko i
should have left him dead thrice i had thought of it onc i mix the
poison in hi drink and then he came in weari with hi plot and
kiss me er he drank and my woman heart grew soft and i overset the
bowl that wa at hi lip do you not rememb saduko
so so for that folli alon i deserv to die for she who would
reignand her beauti ey flash royallymust have a tiger
heart not that of a woman well becaus i wa too kind i must die

councillor till you reach the gulf into which i sink that yawn for
all of you o king when you meet me again at the bottom of that gulf
what a tale you will have to tell me you who ar but the shadow of a
king you whose heart henceforth must be eaten out by a worm that is
call loveofthelost o princ and conqueror cetewayo what a tale

better of thi man against hi will and judgment and becaus of that
soft heart of mine i let him go ye i let the rare fish go when he
wa on my hook it is well that i should have let him go sinc had i
kept him a fine stori would have been spoil and i should have becom
noth but a white hunter servant to be thrust awai behind the door
when the white inkosikazi came to eat hi meati mameena who never
love to stand out of sight behind a door well when he wa at my feet
and i spare him he made me a promis a veri small promis which yet
i think he will keep now when we part for a littl while macumazahn
did you not promis to kiss me onc more upon the lip whenev and
wherev i should ask you

thei had held saduko
then come now macumazahn and give me that farewel kiss the king
will permit it and sinc i have now no husband who take death to
husband there is none to sai you nai
i rose it seem to me that i could not help myself i went to her
thi woman surround by implac enemi thi woman who had plai
for great stake and lost them and who knew so well how to lose i
stood befor her asham and yet not asham for someth of her
great evil though it might be drove out my shame and i knew that
my foolish wa lost in a vast tragedi
slowli she lift her languid arm and threw it about my neck slowli she
bent her red lip to mine and kiss me onc upon the mouth and onc
upon the forehead but between those two kiss she did a thing so
swiftli that my ey could scarc follow what she did it seem to
me that she brush her left hand across her lip and that i saw her
throat rise as though she swallow someth then she thrust me from
her sai
farewel o macumazana you will never forget thi kiss of mine and
when we meet again we shall have much to talk of for between now and
then your stori will be long farewel zikali i prai that all your
plan mai succe sinc those you hate ar those i hate and i

backdead the poison drug she had taken work well and swiftli
such wa the end of mameena child of storm
a deep silenc follow a silenc of aw and wonder till suddenli
it wa broken by a sound of dread laughter it came from the lip
of zikali the ancient zikali the

of the dark behind me there aros the sound of hi loud and eeri
laughter
next morn i open the packet which he had given me after wonder
onc or twice whether i should not thrust it down an antbear hole as it
wa but thi somehow i could not find the heart to do though now i
wish i had insid cut from the black core of the umzimb wood with
just a littl of the white sap left on it to mark the ey teeth and
nail wa a like of mameena of cours it wa rude execut but
it wasor rather is for i have it stilla wonderfulli good portrait

outstretch her head held forward with the lip part just as though
she were about to embrac somebodi and in on of her hand cut also

i presum or perhap umbelazi
nor wa thi all for the figur wa wrap in a woman hair which i
knew at onc for that of mameena thi hair be held in place by the
necklet of big blue bead she us to wear about her throat
some five year had gone by dure which mani thing had happen to me
that need not be record here when on dai i found myself in a rather
remot part of the umvoti district of natal some mile to the east of a
mountain call the eland kopj whither i had gone to carri out a
big deal in meali over which by the wai i lost a good bit of monei
that ha alwai been my fate when i plung into commerci ventur
on night my wagon which were overload with these confound
weevilli meali got stuck in the drift of a small tributari of the
tugela that most inopportun had come down in flood just as dark
fell i manag to get them up the bank in the midst of a pelt rain
that soak me to the bone there seem to be no prospect of light
a fire or of obtain ani decent food so i wa about to go to bed
supperless when a flash of lightn show me a larg kraal situat
upon a hillsid about half a mile awai and an idea enter my mind
who is the headman of that kraal i ask of on of the kafir who had
collect round us in our troubl as such idl fellow alwai do
tshoza inkoosi answer the man
tshoza tshoza i said for the name seem familiar to me who is
tshoza
ikona i dont know inkoosi he came from zululand some year ago
with saduko the mad
then of cours i rememb at onc and my mind flew back to the
night when old tshoza the brother of matiwan saduko father had cut
out the cattl of the bangu and we had fought the battl in the pass
oh i said is it so then lead me to tshoza and i will give you
a scotchman that is a twoshil piec so call becaus some
enterpris emigr from scotland pass off a vast number of them
among the simpl nativ of natal as substitut for halfcrown
tempt by thi liber offerand it wa veri liber becaus i wa
anxiou to get to tshoza kraal befor it inhabit went to bedth
medit kafir consent to guid me by a dark and deviou path that
ran through bush and drip field of corn at length we arrivedfor
if the kraal wa onli half a mile awai the path to it cover fulli two
milesand glad enough wa i when we had wade the last stream and found
ourselv at it gate
in respons to the usual inquiri conduct amid a choru of yap
dog i wa inform that tshoza did not live there but somewher els
that he wa too old to see anyon that he had gone to sleep and could
not be disturb that he wa dead and had been buri last week and so
forth
look here my friend i said at last to the fellow who wa tell me
all these li you go to tshoza in hi grave and sai to him that if he
doe not come out aliv instantli macumazahn will deal with hi cattl
as onc he dealt with those of bangu
impress with the strang of thi messag the man depart and
present in the dim light of the rainwash moon i perceiv a
littl old man run toward me for tshoza who wa pretti ancient
at the begin of thi histori had not been made younger by a sever
wound at the battl of the tugela and mani other troubl
macumazahn he said is that realli you why i heard that you
were dead long ago ye and sacrif an ox for the welfar of your
spirit
and at it afterward ill be bound i answer
oh it must be you he went on who cannot be deceiv for it is
true we at that ox combin the sacrific to your spirit with a
feast for why should anyth be wast when on is poor ye ye
it must be you for who els would come creep about a man kraal at
night except the watcherbynight enter macumazahn and be welcom
so i enter and at a good meal while we talk over old time
and now where is saduko i ask suddenli as i lit my pipe
saduko he answer hi face chang as he spoke oh of cours he
is here you know i came awai with him from zululand why well to
tell the truth becaus after the part we had playedagainst my will
macumazahnat the battl of endondakusuka i thought it safer to be
awai from a countri where those who have worn their kaross insid out
find mani enemi and few friend
quit so i said but about saduko
oh i told you did i not he is in the next hut and dy
dy what of tshoza
i dont know he answer mysteri but i think he must be
bewitch for a long while a year or more he ha eaten littl and
cannot bear to be alon in the dark inde ever sinc he left zululand
he ha been veri strang and moodi
now i rememb what old zikali had said to me year befor to the
effect that saduko wa live with a ghost which would kill him
doe he think much about umbelazi tshoza i ask
o macumazana he think of noth els the spirit of umbelazi is in
him dai and night
inde i said can i see him
i dont know macumazahn i will go and ask the ladi nandi at onc
for if you can i believ there is no time to lose and he left the
hut
ten minut later he return with a woman nandi the sweet herself
the same quiet dignifi nandi whom i us to know onli now somewhat
worn with troubl and look older than her year
greet macumazahn she said i am pleas to see you although it
is strang veri strang that you should come here just at thi time
saduko is leav uson a long journei macumazahn
i answer that i had heard so with grief and wonder whether he would
like to see me
ye veri much macumazahn onli be prepar to find him differ from
the saduko whom you knew be pleas to follow me
so we went out of tshoza hut across a courtyard to anoth larg hut
which we enter it wa lit with a good lamp of european make also a
bright fire burn upon the hearth so that the place wa as light as
dai at the side of the hut a man lai upon some blanket watch by a
woman hi ey were cover with hi hand and he wa moan
drive him awai drive him awai cannot he suffer me to die in peac
would you drive awai your old friend macumazahn saduko ask nandi
veri gentli macumazahn who ha come from far to see you
he sat up and the blanket fall off him show me that he wa

he began to wander in hi mind

take your share of the cattl so the blood of the amakoba is not
on your head ah what a fight wa that which the amawomb made at
endondakusuka you were with them you rememb macumazahn and why wa
i not at your side oh then we would have swept awai the usutu as the
wind sweep ash why wa i not at your side to share the glori i
rememb nowbecaus of the daughter of storm she betrai me for
umbelazi and i betrai umbelazi for her and now he haunt me whose
great i brought to the dust and the usutu wolf cetewayo curl
himself up in hi form and grow fat on hi food andand macumazahn
it ha all been done in vain for mameena hate me ye i can read it
in her ey she mock and hate me wors in death than she did in
life and she sai thatthat it wa not all her faultbecaus she
lovesbecaus she love
a look of bewilder came upon hi facehi poor torment
face then suddenli saduko threw hi arm wide and sob in an
everweaken voic
allal done in vain oh mameena mameena mameena and fell
back dead
saduko ha gone awai said nandi as she drew a blanket over hi
face but i wonder she ad with a littl hyster smile oh
how i wonder who it wa the spirit of mameena told him that she
lovedmameena who wa born without a heart
i made no answer for at that moment i heard a veri curiou sound which
seem to me to proce from somewher abov the hut of what did it
remind me ah i knew it wa like the sound of the dread laughter
of zikali openerofroadszikali the
thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn
doubtless howev it wa onli the cry of some stormdriven night bird
or perhap it wa an hyena that laughedan hyena that scent death
