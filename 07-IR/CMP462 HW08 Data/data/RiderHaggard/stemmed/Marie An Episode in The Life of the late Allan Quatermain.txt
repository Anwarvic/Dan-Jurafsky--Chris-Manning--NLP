forese have at length brought a period of peac to southern africa
todai the flag of england fli from the zambesi to the cape beneath
it shadow mai all ancient feud and blood jealousi be forgotten
mai the nativ prosper also and be justli rule for after all in the
begin the land wa their such i know ar your hope as thei ar
mine
it is howev with an earlier africa that thi stori deal in 1836
hate and suspicion ran high between the home govern and it
dutch subject ow to the free of the slave and mutual
misunderstand the cape coloni wa then in tumult almost in
rebellion and the boer by thousand sought new home in the unknown
savagepeopl north of thi bloodstain time i have tri to

the author hope that the reader mai find some histor interest in
the tale set out in these page of the massacr of the boer gener
retief and hi companion at the hand of the zulu king dingaan
save for some ad circumst he believ it to be accur in it
detail
the same mai be said of the account given of the hideou suffer of
the trekboer who wander into the fever veld there to perish in the
neighbourhood of delagoa bai of these suffer especi those that
were endur by triechard and hi companion a few brief contemporari
record still exist buri in scarc work of refer it mai be
mention also that it wa a common belief among the boer of that
gener that the cruel death of retief and hi companion and other
misfortun which befel them were due to the treacher plot of
an englishman or of englishmen with the despot dingaan
editor note
the follow extract explain how the manuscript of mari and with
it some other on of which is name child of storm came into the
hand of the editor
it is from a letter date januari 17th 1909 and written by mr
georg curti the brother of sir henri curti bart who it will
be rememb wa on of the late mr allan quatermain friend and
companion in adventur when he discov king solomon mine and who
afterward disappear with him in central africa
thi extract run as follow
you mai recal that our mutual and dear friend old allan quatermain
left me the sole executor of hi will which he sign befor he set
out with my brother henri for zuvendi where he wa kill the court
howev not be satisfi that there wa ani legal proof of hi
death invest the capit fund in truste secur and by my
advic let hi place in yorkshir to a tenant who ha remain in
occup of it dure the last two decad now that tenant is
dead and at the earnest prayer of the chariti which benefit under
quatermain will and of myselffor in my uncertain state of health
i have for long been most anxiou to wind up thi executorshipabout
eight month ago the court at last consent to the distribut of thi
larg fund in accord with the term of the will
thi of cours involv the sale of the real properti and befor it
wa put up to auction i went over the hous in compani of the solicitor
appoint by the court on the top land in the room quatermain us
to occupi we found a seal cupboard that i open it prove to be
full of variou articl which evid he had prize becaus of their
associ with hi earthi life these i need not enumer here
especi as i have reserv them as hi residuari legate and in the
event of my death thei will pass to you under my will
among these relic howev i found a stout box made of some red
foreign wood that contain variou document and letter and a
bundl of manuscript under the tape which fasten these manuscript
togeth as you will see is a scrap of paper on which is written in
blue pencil a direct sign allan quatermain that in the event of
anyth happen to him these mss ar to be sent to you for whom
as you know he had a high regard and that at your sole discret you
ar to burn or publish them as you mai see fit
so after all these year as we both remain aliv i carri out our old
friend instruct and send you hi bequest which i trust mai prove
of interest and valu i have read the ms call mari and certainli
am of the opinion that it ought to be publish for i think it a
strang and move tale of a great loveful moreov of forgotten
histori
that name child of storm also seem veri interest as a studi of
savag life and the other mai be the same but my ey ar troubl
me so much that i have not been abl to deciph them i hope howev
that i mai be spare long enough to see them in print
poor old allan quatermain it is as though he had suddenli reappear
from the dead so at least i thought as i perus these stori of a
period of hi life of which i do not rememb hi speak to me
and now my respons in thi matter is finish and your begin
do what you like about the manuscript
georg curti
as mai be imagin i the editor wa consider astonish when i
receiv thi letter and the accompani bundl of closelywritten mss
to me also it wa as though my old friend had risen from the grave and
onc more stood befor me tell some histori of hi stormi and
tragic past in that quiet measur voic that i have never been abl to
forget
the first manuscript i read wa that entitl mari it deal with mr
quatermain strang experi when as a veri young man he accompani
the illfat pieter retief and the boer commiss on an embassi to
the zulu despot dingaan thi it will be rememb end in their
massacr quatermain himself and hi hottentot servant han be the
sole survivor of the slaughter also it deal with anoth matter more
person to himself name hi courtship of and marriag to hi first
wife mari marai
of thi mari i never heard him speak save onc i rememb that on a
certain occasionit wa that of a garden fte for a local charityi
wa stand by quatermain when someon introduc to him a young girl
who wa stai in the neighborhood and had distinguish herself
by sing veri prettili at the fte her surnam i forget but her
christian name wa mari he start when he heard it and ask if she
were french the young ladi answer no but onli of french extract
through her grandmoth who also wa call mari
inde he said onc i knew a maiden not unlik you who wa also of
french extract and call mari mai you prove more fortun in life
than she wa though better or nobler you can never be and he bow to
her in hi simpl courtli fashion then turn awai afterward when
we were alon i ask him who wa thi mari of whom he had spoken to
the young ladi he paus a littl then answer
she wa my first wife but i beg you not to speak of her to me or to
anyon els for i cannot bear to hear her name perhap you will learn
all about her on dai then to my grief and astonish he broke
into someth like a sob and abruptli left the room
after read the record of thi mari i can well understand why he wa
so move i print it practic as it left hi hand
there ar other mss also on of which head child of storm
relat the move histori of a beauti and i fear i must add
wick zulu girl name mameena who did much evil in her dai and went
unrepent from the world
anoth amongst other thing tell the secret stori of the caus
of the defeat of cetewayo and hi armi by the english in 1879 which
happen not long befor quatermain met sir henri curti and captain
good
these three narr ar inde more or less connect with each
other at least a certain ag dwarf call zikali a witchdoctor
and an terribl man ha to do with all of them although in the first
mari he is onli vagu mention in connect with the massacr
of retief whereof he wa doubtless the primari instig as mari
come first in chronolog order and wa place on the top of the
pile by it author i publish it first with the other i hope to deal
later on as i mai find time and opportun
but the futur must take care of itself we cannot control it and it
event ar not in our hand meanwhil i hope that those who in their
youth have read of king solomon mine and zuvendi and perhap
some other who ar younger mai find as much of interest in these new

chapter i allan learn french
although in my old ag i allan quatermain have taken to writingaft
a fashionnev yet have i set down a singl word of the tale of my
first love and of the adventur that ar group around her beauti
and tragic histori i suppos thi is becaus it ha alwai seem to
me too holi and faroff a mattera holi and faroff as is that heaven
which hold the splendid spirit of mari marai but now in my ag
that which wa faroff draw near again and at night in the depth
between the star sometim i seem to see the open door through
which i must pass and lean earthward across their threshold with
outstretch arm and dark and dewi ey a shadow long forgotten by all
save meth shadow of mari marai
an old man dream doubtless no more still i will try to set down
that histori which end in so great a sacrific and on so worthi of
record though i hope that no human ey will read it until i also am
forgotten or at ani rate have grown dim in the gather mist of
oblivion and i am glad that i have wait to make thi attempt for it
seem to me that onli of late have i come to understand and appreci
at it true valu the charact of her of whom i tell and the
passion affect which wa her bounteou offer to on so utterli
unworthi as myself what have i done i wonder that to me should have
been decre the love of two such women as mari and that of stella
also now long dead to whom alon in the world i told all her tale
i rememb i fear lest she should take it ill but thi wa not so
inde dure our brief marri dai she thought and talk much of
mari and some of her last word to me were that she wa go to seek
her and that thei would wait for me togeth in the land of love pure
and immort
so with stella death all that side of life came to an end for me
sinc dure the long year which stretch between then and now i have
never said anoth tender word to woman i admit howev that onc
long afterward a certain littl witch of a zulu did sai tender word
to me and for an hour or so almost turn my head an art in which she
had great skill thi i sai becaus i wish to be quit honest although
iti mean my head for there wa no heart involv in the mattercam
straight again at onc her name wa mameena and i have set down her
remark stori elsewher
to return as i have alreadi written in anoth book i pass my youth
with my old father a church of england clergyman in what is now the
cradock district of the cape coloni
then it wa a wild place enough with a veri small white popul
among our few neighbour wa a boer farmer of the name of henri marai
who live about fifteen mile from our station on a fine farm call
maraisfontein i sai he wa a boer but as mai be guess from both hi
christian and surnam hi origin wa huguenot hi forefath who
wa also name henri maraisthough i think the marai wa spelt
rather differ thenhav been on of the first of that faith who
emigr to south africa to escap the cruelti of loui xiv at the
time of the revoc of the edict of nant
unlik most boer of similar descent these particular maraisfor
of cours there ar mani other famili so callednev forgot their
origin inde from father to son thei kept up some knowledg of the
french tongu and among themselv often spoke it after a fashion
at ani rate it wa the habit of henri marai who wa excess
religi to read hi chapter of the bibl which it is or wa the
custom of the boer to spell out everi morn should their learn
allow them to do so not in the taal or patoi dutch but in good
old french i have the veri book from which he us to read now for
curious enough in after year when all these event had long been
gather to the past i chanc to bui it among a parcel of other
work at the weekli auction of odd and end on the market squar of
maritzburg i rememb that when i open the great tome bound over
the origin leather board in buckskin and discov to whom it had
belong i burst into tear there wa no doubt about it for as wa
customari in old dai thi bibl had sundri flyleav sewn up with it
for the purpos of the record of event import to it owner
the first entri were made by the origin henri marai and record how
he and hi compatriot were driven from franc hi father have lost
hi life in the religi persecut after thi come a long list of
birth marriag and death continu from gener to gener
and amongst them a few note tell of such matter as the chang of
the dwellingplac of the famili alwai in french toward the end of
the list appear the entri of the birth of the henri marai whom i knew
ala too well and of hi onli sister then is written hi marriag to
mari labuschagn also be it note of the huguenot stock in the
next year follow the birth of mari marai my mari and after a
long interv for no other children were born the death of her mother
immedi below appear the follow curiou passag
le 3 janvier 1836 je quitt ce pai voulant me sauver du maudit
gouvern britanniqu comm me anctr se sont sauv de ce
diableloui xiv
a ba le roi et le ministr tyranniqu vive la libert
which indic veri clearli the charact and the opinion of henri
marai and the feel among the trekboer at that time
thu the record close and the stori of the marai endsthat is so far
as the write in the bibl go for that branch of the famili is now
extinct
their last chapter i will tell in due cours
there wa noth remark about my introduct to mari marai i
did not rescu her from ani attack of a wild beast or pull her out of a
rage river in a fashion suit to romanc inde we interchang our
young idea across a small and extrem massiv tabl which in fact
had onc done duti as a block for the chop up of meat to thi hour
i can see the hundr of line run crisscross upon it surfac
especi those opposit to where i us to sit
on dai sever year after my father had emigr to the cape the
heer marai arriv at our hous in search i think of some lost
oxen he wa a thin beard man with rather wild dark ey set close
togeth and a quick nervou manner not in the least like that of a
dutch boeror so i recal him my father receiv him courteous and
ask him to stop to dine which he did
thei talk togeth in french a tongu that my father knew well
although he had not us it for year dutch he could not or rather
would not speak if he could help it and mr marai prefer not to
talk english to meet someon who could convers in french delight
him and although hi version of the languag wa that of two centuri
befor and my father wa larg deriv from read thei got on
veri well togeth if not too fast
at length after a paus mr marai point to myself a small and
stubblyhair youth with a sharp nose ask my father whether he
would like me to be instruct in the french tongu the answer wa that
noth would pleas him better
although he ad sever to judg by my own experi where
latin and greek ar concern i doubt hi capac to learn anyth
so an arrang wa made that i should go over for two dai in each
week to maraisfontein sleep there on the interven night and
acquir a knowledg of the french tongu from a tutor whom mr marai
had hire to instruct hi daughter in that languag and other subject
i rememb that my father agre to pai a certain proport of thi
tutor salari a plan which suit the thrifti boer veri well inde
thither accordingli i went in due cours noth loth for on the
veld between our station and maraisfontein mani pauw and koranthat is
big and small bustardswer to be found to sai noth of occasion
buck and i wa allow to carri a gun which even in those dai i
could us fairli well so to maraisfontein i rode on the appoint dai
attend by a hottentot afterrid a certain han of whom i shall
have a good deal to tell i enjoi veri good sport on the road
arriv at the stead laden with on pauw two koran and a littl
klipspring buck which i had been lucki enough to shoot as it bound
out of some rock in front of me
there wa a peach orchard plant round maraisfontein which just then
wa a mass of love pink blossom and as i rode through it slowli not
be sure of my wai to the hous a lanki child appear in front of
me clad in a frock which exactli match the colour of the peach bloom
i can see her now her dark hair hang down her back and her big shy
ey stare at me from the shadow of the dutch kappi which she
wore inde she seem to be all ey like a dikkop or thickhead
plover at ani rate i note littl els about her
i pull up my poni and stare at her feel veri shy and not know
what to sai for a while she stare back at me be afflict
presum with the same complaint then spoke with an effort in a
voic that wa veri soft and pleasant
ar you the littl allan quatermain who is come to learn french with
me she ask in dutch
of cours i answer in the same tongu which i knew well but
why do you call me littl missi i am taller than you i ad
indignantli for when i wa young my lack of height wa alwai a sore
point with me
i think not she repli but get off that hors and we will measur
here against thi wall
so i dismount and have assur herself that i had no heel to my
boot i wa wear the kind of rawhid slipper that the boer call
veldshoon she took the write slate which she wa carryingit had
no frame i rememb be in fact but a piec of the materi us
for roofingand press it down tight on my stubbl hair which stuck
up then as now made a deep mark in the soft sandston of the wall with
the hard point pencil
there she said that is justli done now littl allan it is your
turn to measur me
so i measur her and behold she wa the taller by a whole halfinch
you ar stand on tipto i said in my vexat
littl allan she repli to stand on tipto would be to lie befor
the good lord and when you come to know me better you will learn that
though i have a dread temper and mani other sin i do not lie
i suppos that i look snub and mortifi for she went on in her
grave grownup wai why ar you angri becaus god made me taller than
you especi as i am whole month older for my father told me so
come let us write our name against these mark so that in a year
or two you mai see how you outgrow me then with the slate pencil she
scratch mari against her mark veri deepli so that it might last
she said after which i wrote allan against mine
ala within the last dozen year chanc took me past maraisfontein
onc more the hous had long been rebuilt but thi particular wall yet
stood i rode to it and look and there faintli could still be seen
the name mari against the littl line and by it the mark that i had
made my own name and with it subsequ measur were gone for
in the interven forti year or so the sandston had flake awai in
place onli her autograph remain and when i saw it i think that i
felt even wors than i did on find whose wa the old bibl that i had
bought upon the market squar at maritzburg
i know that i rode awai hurriedli without even stop to inquir into
whose hand the farm had pass through the peach orchard i rode where
the treesperhap the same perhap otherswer onc more in bloom
for the season of the year wa that when mari and i first met nor did
i draw rein for half a score of mile
but here i mai state that mari alwai stai just half an inch the
taller in bodi and how much taller in mind and spirit i cannot tell
when we had finish our measur match mari turn to lead me to
the hous and pretend to observ for the first time the beauti
bustard and the two koran hang from my saddl also the klipspring
buck that han the hottentot carri behind him on hi hors ask
did you shoot all these allan quatermain
ye i answer proudli i kill them in four shot and the pauw
and koran were fly not sit which is more than you could have
done although you ar taller miss mari
i do not know she answer reflect i can shoot veri well with
a rifl for my father ha taught me but i never would shoot at live
thing unless i must becaus i wa hungri for i think that to kill is
cruel but of cours it is differ with men she ad hastili
and no doubt you will be a great hunter on dai allan quatermain
sinc you can alreadi aim so well
i hope so i answer blush at the compliment for i love
hunt and when there ar so mani wild thing it doe not matter if we
kill a few i shot these for you and your father to eat
come then and give them to him he will thank you and she led the
wai through the gate in the sandston wall into the yard where the
outbuild stood in which the ride hors and the best of the
breed cattl were kept at night and so past the end of the long
onestori hous that wa stonebuilt and whitewash to the stoep or
veranda in front of it
on the broad stoep which command a pleasant view over roll
parklik countri where mimosa and other tree grew in clump two men
were seat drink strong coffe although it wa not yet ten oclock
in the morn
hear the sound of the hors on of these mynheer marai whom i
alreadi knew rose from hi hidestrung chair he wa as i think i
have said not in the least like on of the phlegmat boer either in
person or in tempera but rather a typic frenchman although no
member of hi race had set foot in franc for a hundr and fifti year
at least so i discov afterward for of cours in those dai i
knew noth of frenchmen
hi companion wa also french leblanc by name but of a veri differ
stamp in person he wa short and stout hi larg head wa bald except
for a fring of curl irongrei hair which grew round it just abov
the ear and fell upon hi shoulder give him the appear of a
tonsur but dishevel priest hi ey were blue and wateri hi
mouth wa rather weak and hi cheek were pale full and flabbi when
the heer marai rose i be an observ youth note that monsieur
leblanc took the opportun to stretch out a rather shaki hand and fill
up hi coffe cup out of a black bottl which from the smell i judg
to contain peach brandi
in fact it mai as well be said at onc that the poor man wa a
drunkard which explain how he with all hi high educ and great
abil came to hold the humbl post of tutor on a remot boer farm
year befor when under the influenc of drink he had commit some
crime in francei dont know what it wa and never inquiredand fled
to the cape to avoid prosecut here he obtain a professorship at
on of the colleg but after a while appear in the lectureroom
quit drunk and lost hi employ the same thing happen in other
town till at last he drift to distant maraisfontein where hi
employ toler hi weak for the sake of the intellectu
companionship for which someth in hi own natur seem to crave
also he look upon him as a compatriot in distress and a great bond
of union between them wa their mutual and virul hatr of england
and the english which in the case of monsieur leblanc who in hi youth
had fought at waterloo and been acquaint with the great emperor wa
not altogeth unnatur
henri maraiss case wa differ but of that i shall have more to sai
later
ah mari said her father speak in dutch so you have found him
at last and he nod toward me ad you should be flatter
littl man look you thi missi ha been sit for two hour in
the sun wait for you although i told her you would not arriv
much befor ten oclock as your father the prdicant said you would
breakfast befor you start well it is natur for she is lone
here and you ar of an ag although of a differ race and hi face
darken as he spoke the word
father answer mari whose blush i could see even in the shadow
of her cap i wa not sit in the sun but under the shade of a
peach tree also i wa work out the sum that monsieur leblanc set
me on my slate see here thei ar and she held up the slate which
wa cover with figur somewhat smudg it is true by the rub
of my stiff hair and of her cap
then monsieur leblanc broke in speak in french of which as it
chanc i understood the sens for my father had ground me in that
tongu and i am natur quick at modern languag at ani rate i
made out that he wa ask if i wa the littl cochon danglai or
english pig whom for hi sin he had to teach he ad that he judg
i must be as my hair stuck up on my headi had taken off my hat out of
politenessa it natur would do on a pig back
thi wa too much for me so befor either of the other could speak i
answer in dutch for rage made me eloqu and bold
ye i am he but mynheer if you ar to be my master i hope you will
not call the english pig ani more to me
inde gamin that is littl scamp and prai what will happen if
i am so bold as to repeat that truth
i think mynheer i repli grow white with rage at thi new
insult the same that ha happen to yonder buck and i point to
the klipspring behind hanss saddl i mean that i shall shoot you
pest au moin il a du courag cet enfant at least the child is
plucki exclaim monsieur leblanc astonish from that moment i mai
add he respect me and never again insult my countri to my face
then marai broke out speak in dutch that i might understand
it is you who should be call pig leblanc not thi boi for earli
as it is you have been drink look the brandi bottl is half empti
is that the exampl you set to the young speak so again and i turn you
out to starv on the veld allan quatermain although as you mai have
heard i do not like the english i beg your pardon i hope you will
forgiv the word thi sot spoke think that you did not understand
and he took off hi hat and bow to me quit in a grand manner as hi
ancestor might have done to a king of franc
leblanc face fell then he rose and walk awai rather unsteadili
as i learn afterward to plung hi head in a tub of cold water and
swallow a pint of new milk which were hi favourit antidot after
too much strong drink at ani rate when he appear again half an hour
later to begin our lesson he wa quit sober and extrem polit
when he had gone my childish anger be appeas i present the heer
marai with my father compliment also with the buck and the bird
whereof the latter seem to pleas him more than the former then my
saddlebag were taken to my room a littl cupboard of a place next to
that occupi by monsieur leblanc and han wa sent to turn the hors
out with the other belong to the farm have first kneehalt
them tightli so that thei should not run awai home
thi done the heer marai show me the room in which we were to have
our lesson on of the sitkamm or sit chamber whereof
unlik most boer stead thi hous boast two i rememb that the
floor wa made of daga that is antheap earth mix with cowdung
into which thousand of peachston had been thrown while it wa
still soft in order to resist footweara rude but fairli effici
expedi and on not unpleas to the ey for the rest there wa
on window open on to the veranda which in that bright climat
admit a shade but suffici light especi as it alwai stood
open the ceil wa of unplast reed a larg bookcas stood in
the corner contain mani french work most of them the properti of
monsieur leblanc and in the centr of the room wa the strong rough
tabl made of nativ yellowwood that onc had serv as a butcher
block i recollect also a colour print of the great napoleon
command at some battl in which he wa victori seat upon a
white hors and wave a fieldmarsh baton over pile of dead and
wound and near the window hang to the reed of the ceil
the nest of a pair of redtail swallow pretti creatur that
notwithstand the mess thei made afford to mari and me endless
amus in the interv of our work
when on that dai i shuffl shyli into thi home place and
think myself alon there fell to examin it suddenli i wa
brought to a standstil by a curiou choke sound which seem to
proce from the shadow behind the bookcas wonder as to it caus
i advanc cautious to discov a pinkclad shape stand in the
corner like a naughti child with her head rest against the wall and
sob slowli
mari marai why do you cry i ask
she turn toss back the lock of long black hair which hung about
her face and answer
allan quatermain i cry becaus of the shame which ha been put upon
you and upon our hous by that drunken frenchman
what of that i ask he onli call me a pig but i think i have
shown him that even a pig ha tusk
ye she repli but it wa not you he meant it wa all the
english whom he hate and the worst of it is that my father is of hi
mind he too hate the english and oh i am sure that troubl will
come of hi hatr troubl and death to mani
well if so we have noth to do with it have we i repli with
the cheer of extrem youth
what make you so sure she said solemnli hush here come monsieur
leblanc
chapter ii the attack on maraisfontein
i do not propos to set out the histori of the year which i spent in
acquir a knowledg of french and variou other subject under the
tuition of the learn but prejud monsieur leblanc inde there
is none to tell sir when monsieur leblanc wa sober he wa a most
excel and wellinform tutor although on apt to digress into mani
side issu which in themselv were not uninstruct when tipsi he
grew excit and harangu us gener upon polit and religion or
rather it revers for he wa an advanc freethink although thi
wa a side to hi charact which howev intox he might be he
alwai manag to conceal from the heer marai i mai add that a certain
childish code of honour prevent us from betrai hi view on thi
and sundri other matter when absolut drunk which on an averag
wa not more than onc a month he simpli slept and we did what we
pleaseda fact which our childish code of honour also prevent us from
betrai
but on the whole we got on veri well togeth for after the incid
of our first meet monsieur leblanc wa alwai polit to me mari
he ador as did everi on about the place from her father down to the
meanest slave need i add that i ador her more than all of them put
togeth first with the love that some children have for each other
and afterward as we becam adult with that wider love by which it
is at onc transcend and made complet strang would it have been
if thi were not so see that we spent nearli half of everi week
practic alon togeth and that from the first mari whose
natur wa as open as the clear noon never conceal her affect for
me true it wa a veri discreet affect almost sisterli or even
motherli in it outward and visibl aspect as though she could never
forget that extra halfinch of height or month or two of ag
moreov from a child she wa a woman as an irishman might sai for
circumst and charact had shape her thu not much more than a
year befor we met her mother whose onli child she wa and whom she
love with all her strong and passion heart di after a linger
ill leav her in charg of her father and hi hous i think it
wa thi heavi bereav in earli youth which colour her natur with
a grei ting of sad and made her seem so much older than her year
so the time went on i worship mari in my secret thought but
sai noth about it and mari talk of and act toward me as
though i were her dear younger brother nobodi not even her father
or mine or monsieur leblanc took the slightest notic of thi
queer relationship or seem to dream that it might lead to ultim
complic which in fact would have been veri distast to them
all for reason that i will explain
needless to sai in due cours as thei were bound to do those
complic aros and under pressur of great physic and moral
excit the truth came out it happen thu
everi reader of the histori of the cape coloni ha heard of the great
kaffir war of 1835 that war took place for the most part in the
district of albani and somerset so that we inhabit of cradock
on the whole suffer littl therefor with the natur optim and
careless of danger of dweller in wild place we began to think
ourselv fairli safe from attack inde so we should have been had
it not been for a foolish action on the part of monsieur leblanc
it seem that on a certain sundai a dai that i alwai spent at home
with my father monsieur leblanc rode out alon to some hill about five
mile distant from maraisfontein he had often been caution that thi
wa an unsaf thing to do but the truth is that the foolish man thought
he had found a rich copper mine in these hill and wa anxiou that no
on should share hi secret therefor on sundai when there were
no lesson and the heer marai wa in the habit of celebr famili
prayer which leblanc dislik it wa customari for him to ride to
these hill and there collect geolog specimen and locat the strike
of hi copper vein on thi particular sabbath which wa veri hot
after he had done whatev he intend to do he dismount from hi
hors a tame old beast leav it loos he partook of the meal he had
brought with him which seem to have includ a bottl of peach brandi
that induc slumber
wake up toward even he found that hi hors had gone and at onc
jump to the conclus that it had been stolen by kaffir although
in truth the anim had but stroll over a ridg in search of grass
run hither and thither to seek it he present cross thi ridg
and met the hors appar be led awai by two of the red kaffir
who as wa usual were arm with assegai as a matter of fact these
men had found the beast and know well to whom it belong were
seek it owner whom earlier in the dai thei had seen upon the
hill in order to restor it to him thi howev never occur
to the mind of monsieur leblanc excit as it wa by the fume of the
peach brandi
lift the doublebarrel gun he carri he fire at the first
kaffir a young man who chanc to be the eldest son and heir of the
chief of the tribe and as the rang wa veri close shot him dead
thereon hi companion leav go of the hors ran for hi life at him
leblanc fire also wound him slightli in the thigh but no more so
that he escap to tell the tale of what he and everi other nativ for
mile round consid a wanton and premedit murder the deed done
the fieri old frenchman mount hi nag and rode quietli home on the
road howev as the peach brandi evapor from hi brain doubt
enter it with the result that he determin to sai noth of hi
adventur to henri marai who he knew wa particularli anxiou to avoid
ani caus of quarrel with the kaffir
so he kept hi own counsel and went to bed befor he wa up next
morn the heer marai suspect neither troubl nor danger had
ridden off to a farm thirti mile or more awai to pai it owner for some
cattl which he had recent bought leav hi home and hi daughter
quit unprotect except by leblanc and the few nativ servant who
were realli slave that live about the place
now on the mondai night i went to bed as usual and slept as i have
alwai done through life like a top till about four in the morn
when i wa awaken by someon tap at the glass of my window
slip from the bed i felt for my pistol as it wa quit dark crept
to the window open it and keep my head below the level of the
sill fear lest it appear should be greet with an assegai
ask who wa there
me baa said the voic of han our hottentot servant who it will
be rememb had accompani me as afterrid when first i went to
maraisfontein i have bad new listen the baa know that i have been
out search for the red cow which wa lost well i found her and wa
sleep by her side under a tree on the veld when about two hour ago
a woman whom i know came up to my camp fire and woke me i ask her
what she wa do at that hour of the night and she answer that she
had come to tell me someth she said that some young men of the tribe
of the chief quabi who live in the hill yonder had been visit
at their kraal and that a few hour befor a messeng had arriv from
the chief sai that thei must return at onc as thi morn at dawn
he and all hi men were go to attack maraisfontein and kill everyon
in it and take the cattl
good god i ejacul why
becaus young baa drawl the hottentot from the other side of the
window becaus someon from maraisfonteini think it wa the vultur
the nativ gave thi name to leblanc on account of hi bald head
and hook noseshot quabi son on sundai when he wa hold hi
hors
good god i said again the old fool must have been drunk when did
you sai the attack wa to beat dawn and i glanc at the star
ad why that will be within less than an hour and the baa marai
is awai
ye croak han and missi mariethink of what the red kaffir
will do with missi mari when their blood is up
i thrust my fist through the window and struck the hottentot toadlik
face on which the starlight gleam faintli
dog i said saddl my mare and the roan hors and get your gun in
two minut i come be swift or i kill you
i go he answer and shot out into the night like a frighten
snake
then i began to dress shout as i dress till my father and the
kaffir ran into the room as i threw on my thing i told them all
send out messeng i said to maraish is at botha farmand to
all the neighbour send for your live gather up the friendli kaffir
and ride like hell for maraisfontein dont talk to me father dont
talk go and do what i tell you stai give me two gun fill the
saddlebag with powder tin and looper and tie them to my mare oh
be quick be quick
now at length thei understood and flew thi wai and that with candl
and lantern two minut laterit could scarc have been morei
wa in front of the stabl just as han led out the bai mare a famou
beast that for two year i had save all my monei to bui someon
strap on the saddlebag while i test the girth someon els
appear with the stout roan stallion that i knew would follow the mare
to the death there wa not time to saddl him so han clamber on to
hi back like a monkei hold two gun under hi arm for i carri
but on and my doublebarrel pistol
send off the messeng i shout to my father if you would see me
again send them swiftli and follow with everi man you can rais
then we were awai with fifteen mile to do and fiveandthirti minut
befor the dawn
softli up the slope i said to han till the beast get their wind
and then ride as you never rode befor
those first two mile of rise ground i thought we should never come
to the end of them and yet i dare not let the mare out lest she should
bucket herself happili she and her companion the stalliona most
endur hors though not so veri swifthad stood idl for the last
thirti hour and of cours had not eaten or drunk sinc sunset
therefor be in fine fettl thei were keen for the busi also we
were light weight
i held in the mare as she spurt up the rise and the hors kept hi
pace to her we reach it crest and befor us lai the great
level plain eleven mile of it and then two mile down hill to
maraisfontein
now i said to han shake loos the rein keep up if you can
awai sped the mare till the keen air of the night sung past my ear and
behind her strain the good roan hors with the hottentot monkei on it
back oh what a ride wa that
further i have gone for a like caus but never at such speed for i
knew the strength of the beast and how long it would last them half an
hour of it thei might endur more and at thi pace thei must founder
or die
and yet such wa the agoni of my fear that it seem to me as though i
onli crept along the ground like a tortois
the roan wa left behind the sound of hi footbeat di awai and i
wa alon with the night and my fear mile ad itself to mile for now
and again the starlight show me a stone or the skeleton of some
dead beast that i knew onc i dash into a herd of trek game so
suddenli that a springbok unabl to stop itself leapt right over
me onc the mare put her foot in an antbear hole and nearli fell but
recov herselfthank be to god unharmedand i work myself back
into the saddl whenc i had been almost shaken if i had fallen oh if
i had fallen
we were near the end of the flat and she began to fail i had
overpress her the pace wa too tremend her speed lessen to an
ordinari fast gallop as she face the gentl rise that led to the brow
and now behind me onc more i heard the sound of the hoof of the
roan the tireless beast wa come up by the time we reach the edg
of the plateau he wa quit near not fifti yard behind for i heard
him whinni faintli
then began the descent the morn star wa set the east grew grei
with light oh could we get there befor the dawn could we get there
befor the dawn that is what my hors hoof beat out to me
now i could see the mass of the tree about the stead and now i dash
into someth though until i wa through it i did not know that it
wa a line of men for the faint light gleam upon the spear of on of
them who had been overthrown
so it wa no lie the kaffir were there as i thought it a fresh
horror fill my heart perhap their murder work wa alreadi done
and thei were depart
the minut of suspenseor wa it but secondsseem an etern but
it end at last now i wa at the door in the high wall that enclos
the outbuild at the back of the hous and there by an inspir
pull up the mareglad enough she wa to stop poor thingfor it
occur to me that if i rode to the front i should veri probabl be
assegai and of no further us i tri the door which wa made
of stout stinkwood plank by design or accid it had been left
unbolt as i thrust it open han arriv with a rush cling to the
roan with hi face hidden in it mane the beast pull up by the side
of the mare which it had been pursu and in the faint light i saw
that an assegai wa fix in it flank
five second later we were in the yard and lock and bar the
door behind us then snatch the saddlebag of ammunit from the
hors we left them stand there and i ran for the back entranc
of the hous bid han rous the nativ who slept in the
outbuild and follow with them if ani on of them show sign of
treacheri he wa to shoot him at onc i rememb that as i went i tore
the spear out of the stallion flank and brought it awai with me
now i wa hammer upon the back door of the hous which i could not
open after a paus that seem long a window wa thrown wide and a
voiceit wa mariesask in frighten tone who wa there
i allan quatermain i answer open at onc mari you ar in
great danger the red kaffir ar go to attack the hous
she flew to the door in her nightdress and at length i wa in the
place
thank god you ar still safe i gasp put on your cloth while i
call leblanc no stai do you call him i must wait here for han and
your slave
awai she sped without a word and present han arriv bring with
him eight frighten men who as yet scarc knew whether thei slept or
woke
is that all i ask then bar the door and follow me to the
sitkamm where the baa keep hi gun
just as we reach it leblanc enter clad in hi shirt and trouser
and wa follow present by mari with a candl
what is it he ask
i took the candl from mari hand and set it on the floor close to
the wall lest it should prove a target for an assegai or a bullet even
in those dai the kaffir had a few firearm for the most part captur
or stolen from white men then in a few word i told them all
and when did you learn all thi ask leblanc in french
at the mission station a littl more than half an hour ago i
answer look at my watch
at the station a littl more than half an hour ago pest it is not
possibl you dream or ar drunken he cri excitedli
all right monsieur we will argu afterward i answer meanwhil
the kaffir ar here for i rode through them and if you want to save
your life stop talk and act mari how mani gun ar there
four she answer of my father two roer and two smaller
on
and how mani of these menand i point to the kaffirscan shoot
three well and on badli allan
good i said let them load the gun with loopersthat is slug
not bulletsand let the rest stand in the passag with their assegai
in case the quabi should try to forc the back door
now in thi hous there were in all but six window on to each
sittingroom on to each of the larger bedroom these four open on
to the veranda and on at either end of the hous to give light and
air to the two small bedroom which were approach through the larger
bedroom at the back fortun there were no window for the stead
wa but on room deep with passag run from the front to the back
door a distanc of littl over fifteen feet
as soon as the gun were load i divid up the men a man with a gun
at each window the righthand sittingroom window i took myself with
two gun mari come with me to load which like all girl in that
wild countri she could do well enough so we arrang ourselv in
a roughandreadi fashion and while we were do it felt quit
cheerfulthat is all except monsieur leblanc who i notic seem
veri much disturb
i do not for on moment mean to suggest that he wa afraid as he might
well have been for he wa an extrem brave and even rash man but
i think the knowledg that hi drunken act had brought thi terribl
danger upon us all weigh on hi mind also there mai have been more
some subtl foreknowledg of the approach end to a life that when
all allow were made could scarc be call well spent at ani
rate he fidget at hi windowplac curs beneath hi breath and
soon as i saw out of the corner of my ey began to have recours
to hi favourit bottl of peach brandi which he fetch out of a
cupboard
the slave too were gloomi as all nativ ar when suddenli awaken
in the night but as the light grew thei becam more cheer it is a
poor kaffir that doe not love fight especi when he ha a gun
and a white man or two to lead him
now that we had made such littl prepar as we could which by the
wai i supplement by caus some furnitur to be pile up against
the front and back door there came a paus which speak for my own
partb after all onli a lad at the timei found veri try
to the nerv there i stood at my window with the two gun on a
doublebarrel and on a singl roer or eleph gun that took
a tremend charg but both be it rememb flint lock for
although percuss cap had been introduc we were a littl behind
the time in cradock there too crouch on the ground besid me
hold the ammunit readi for reload her long black hair
flow about her shoulder wa mari marai now a wellgrown young
woman in the intens silenc she whisper to me
why did you come here allan you were safe yonder and now you will
probabl be kill
to try to save you i answer simpli what would you have had me
do
to try to save me oh that is good of you but you should have thought
of yourself
then i should still have thought of you mari
why allan
becaus you ar myself and more than myself if anyth happen to
you what would my life be to me
i dont quit understand allan she repli stare down at the
floor tell me what do you mean
mean you silli girl i said what can i mean except that i love

oh she said now i understand then she rais herself upon her
knee and held up her face to me to kiss ad there that my
answer the first and perhap the last thank you allan dear i am glad
to have heard that for you see on or both of us mai die soon
as she spoke the word an assegai flash through the windowplac
pass just between our head so we gave over lovemak and turn
our attent to war
now the light wa begin to grow flow out of the pearli eastern
sky but no attack had yet been deliv although that on wa
immin that spear fix in the plaster of the wall behind us show
clearli perhap the kaffir had been frighten by the gallop of
hors through their line in the dark not know how mani of them
there might have been or perhap thei were wait to see better where
to deliv their onset these were the idea that occur to me but
both were wrong
thei were stai their hand until the mist lift a littl from the
hollow below the stead where the cattl kraal were situat for while
the fog remain thei could not see to get the beast out these thei
wish to make sure of and drive awai befor the fight began lest
dure it progress someth should happen to rob them of their booti
present from these kraal where the heer maraiss horn beast and
sheep were pen at night about on hundr and fifti of the former
and some two thousand of the latter to sai noth of the hors for
he wa a larg and prosper farmer there aros a sound of bellow
neigh and baa and with it that of the shout of men
thei ar drive off the stock said mari oh my poor father he is
ruin it will break hi heart
bad enough i answer but there ar thing that might be wors
hark
as i spoke there came a sound of stamp feet and of a wild war chant
then in the edg of the mist that hung abov the hollow where the
cattl kraal were figur appear move swiftli to and fro look
ghostli and unreal the kaffir were marshal their men for the
attack a minut more and it had begun on up the slope thei came in
long waver line sever hundr of them whistl and scream
shake their spear their warplum and hair trap blown back by
the breez the lust of slaughter in their roll ey two or three of
them had gun which thei fire as thei ran but where the bullet went
i do not know over the hous probabl
i call out to leblanc and the kaffir not to shoot till i did for i
knew that thei were poor marksmen and that much depend upon our first
vollei be effect then as the captain of thi attack came within
thirti yard of the stoepfor now the light grow swiftli wa
strong enough to enabl me to distinguish him by hi apparel and the
rifl which he heldi loos at him with the roer and shot him
dead inde the heavi bullet pass through hi bodi mortal wound
anoth of the quabi behind these were the first men that i ever
kill in war
as thei fell leblanc and the rest of our peopl fire also the slug
from their gun do great execut at that rang which wa just long
enough to allow them to scatter when the smoke clear a littl i saw
that nearli a dozen men were down and that the rest dismai by thi
recept had halt if thei had come on then while we were load
doubtless thei might have rush the place but be unus to the
terribl effect of firearm thei paus amaz a number of them
twenti or thirti perhap cluster about the bodi of the fallen
kaffir and seiz my second gun i fire both barrel at these with
such fear effect that the whole regiment took to their heel and
fled leav their dead and wound on the ground as thei ran our
servant cheer but i call to them to be silent and load swiftli
know well that the enemi would soon return
for a time howev noth happen although we could hear them
talk somewher near the cattl kraal about a hundr and fifti yard
awai mari took advantag of thi paus i rememb to fetch food and
distribut it among us i for on wa glad enough to get it
now the sun wa up a sight for which i thank heaven for at ani
rate we could no longer be surpris also with the daylight some
of my fear pass awai sinc dark alwai make danger twice as
terribl to man and beast whilst we were still eat and fortifi
the windowplac as best we could so as to make them difficult to
enter a singl kaffir appear wave abov hi head a stick to which
wa ti a white oxtail as a sign of truce i order that no on
should fire and when the man who wa a bold fellow had reach the
spot where the dead captain lai call to him ask hi busi for
i could speak hi languag well
he answer that he had come with a messag from quabi thi wa the
messag that quabi eldest son had been cruelli murder by the fat
white man call vultur who live with the heer marai and that he
quabi would have blood for blood still he did not wish to kill the
young white chieftai that wa mari or the other in the hous
with whom he had no quarrel therefor if we would give up the fat white
man that he might make him die slowli quabi would be content with
hi life and with the cattl that he had alreadi taken by wai of a fine
and leav us and the hous unmolest
now when leblanc understood the natur of thi offer he went perfectli
mad with mingl fear and rage and began to shout and swear in french
be silent i said we do not mean to surrend you although you have
brought all thi troubl on us your chanc of life is as good as our
ar you not asham to act so befor these black peopl
when at last he grew more or less quiet i call to the messeng that
we white folk were not in the habit of abandon each other and that
we would live or die togeth still i bade him tell quabi that if we
did die the vengeanc taken on him and all hi peopl would be to wipe
them out till not on of them wa left and therefor that he would do
well not to caus ani of our blood to flow also i ad that we had
thirti men in the hous which of cours wa a lie and plenti of
ammunit and food so that if he chose to continu the attack it would
be the wors for him and hi tribe
on hear thi the herald shout back that we should everi on of us
be dead befor noon if he had hi wai still he would report my word
faithfulli to quabi and bring hi answer
then he turn and began to walk off just as he did so a shot wa fire
from the hous and the man pitch forward to the ground then rose
again and stagger back toward hi peopl with hi right shoulder
shatter and hi arm swing
who did that i ask through the smoke which prevent me from
see
i parbleu shout leblanc sapristi that black devil want to
tortur me leblanc the friend of the great napoleon well at least i
have tortur him whom i meant to kill
ye you fool i answer and we too shall be tortur becaus of
your wicked you have shot a messeng carri a flag of truce and
that the quabi will never forgiv oh i tell you that you have hit us
as well as him who had it not been for you might have been spare
these word i said quit quietli and in dutch so that our kaffir might
understand them though realli i wa boil with wrath
but leblanc did not answer quietli
who ar you he shout you wretch littl englishman who dare to
lectur me leblanc the friend of the great napoleon
now i drew my pistol and walk up to the man
be quiet you drunken sot i said for i guess that he had drunk
more of the brandi in the dark if you ar not quiet and do not
obei me who am in command here either i will blow your brain out or
i will give you to these men and i point to han and the kaffir
who had gather round him mutter omin do you know what thei
will do with you thei will throw you out of the hous and leav you to
settl your quarrel with quabi alon
leblanc look first at the pistol and next at the face of the
nativ and saw someth in on or other of them or in both that
caus him to chang hi note
pardon monsieur he said i wa excit i knew not what i said
if you ar young you ar brave and clever and i will obei you and he
went to hi station and began to reload hi gun as he did so a great
shout of furi rose from the cattl kraal the wound herald had reach
the quabi and wa tell them of the treacheri of the white peopl
chapter iii the rescu
the second quabi advanc did not begin till about halfpast seven even
savag love their live and appreci the fact that wound hurt veri
much and these were no except to the rule their first rush had
taught them a bitter lesson of which the fruit wa evid in the
crippl or dy men who roll to and fro bake in the hot sun within
a few yard of the stoep not to speak of those who would never stir
again now the space around the hous be quit open and bare of
cover it wa obviou that it could not be storm without further heavi
loss in order to avoid such loss a civilis peopl would have
advanc by mean of trench but of these the quabi knew noth
moreov dig tool were lack to them
so it came about that thei hit upon anoth and in the circumst
a not ineffici expedi the cattl kraal wa built of rough
unmortar stone those stone thei took each man carri two or
three which rush forward thei pile up into scatter rough
defenc of about eighteen inch or two feet high these defenc were
instantli occupi by as mani warrior as could take shelter behind
them ly on on top of the other of cours those savag who
carri the first stone were expos to our fire with the result that
mani of them fell but there were alwai plenti more behind as thei
were be built at a dozen differ point and we had but seven gun
befor we could reload a particular schanz of which perhap the first
builder had fallen would be rais so high that our slug could no
longer hurt those who lai behind it also our suppli of ammunit wa
limit and the constant expenditur wast it so much that at length
onli about six charg per man remain at last inde i wa oblig
to order the fire to ceas so that we might reserv ourselv for the
great rush which could not now be much delai
find that thei were no longer harass by our bullet the quabi
advanc more rapidli direct their attack upon the south end of the
hous where there wa but on window and thu avoid the fire that
might be pour upon them from the variou open under the veranda
at first i wonder why thei select thi end till mari remind me
that thi part of the dwell wa thatch with reed wherea the rest
of the build which had been erect more recent wa slate
their object wa to fire the roof so soon as their last wall wa near
enough that is about halfpast ten of the clock thei began to throw
into the thatch assegai to which were attach bunch of burn
grass mani of these went out but at length as we gather from
their shout on caught within ten minut thi part of the hous wa
burn
now our state becam desper we retreat across the central passag
fear lest the blaze rafter should fall upon our nativ who were
lose heart and would no longer stai beneath them but the quabi
more bold clamber in through the south window and attack us in the
doorwai of the larger sittingroom
here the final fight began as thei rush at us we shot till thei went
down in heap almost at our last charg thei gave back and just then
the roof fell upon them
oh what a terribl scene wa that the dens cloud of smoke the
scream of the trap and burn men the turmoil the agoni
the front door wa burst in by a flank onslaught
leblanc and a slave who wa near him were seiz by black clawlik
hand and drag out what becam of the frenchman i do not know for
the nativ haul him awai but i fear hi end must have been dread
as he wa taken aliv the servant i saw them assegai so at least he
di at onc i fire my last shot kill a fellow who wa flourish
a battleax then dash the butt of the gun into the face of the man
behind him fell him and seiz mari by the hand drag her
back into the northernmost roomthat in which i wa accustom to
sleepand shut and bar the door
allan she gasp allan dear it is finish i cannot fall into the
hand of those men kill me allan
all right i answer i will i have my pistol on barrel for you
and on for me
no no perhap you might escap after all but you see i am a woman
and dare not risk it come now i am readi and she knelt down open
her arm to receiv the embrac of death and look up at me with her
love piti ey
it doesnt do to kill on love and live on oneself i answer
hoars we have got to go togeth and i cock both barrel of the
pistol
the hottentot han who wa in the place with us saw and understood
it is right it is best he said and turn he hid hi ey with
hi hand
wait a littl allan she exclaim it will be time when the door is
down and perhap god mai still help us
he mai i answer doubtfulli but i would not count on it noth
can save us now unless the other come to rescu us and that too much
to hope for
then a thought struck me and i ad with a dread laugh i wonder
where we shall be in five minut
oh togeth dear togeth for alwai in some new and beauti
world for you do love me dont you as i love you mayb that better
than live on here where we should be sure to have troubl and perhap

i nod my head for though i love life i love mari more and
i felt that we were make a good end after a brave fight thei were
batter at the door now but thank heaven marai had made strong
door and it held a while
the wood began to give at last an assegai appear through a shatter
plank but han stab along the line of it with the spear he held
that which i had snatch from the flank of the hors and it wa
drop with a scream black hand were thrust through the hole and the
hottentot hack and cut at them with the spear but other came more
than he could pierc and the whole doorfram began to be drag
outward
now mari be readi i gasp lift the pistol
oh christ receiv me she answer faintli it wont hurt much will

pour from me i place the muzzl within an inch of her forehead and
began to press the trigger my god ye i actual began to press the
trigger softli and steadili for i wish to make no mistak
it wa at thi veri moment abov the dread turmoil of the roar
flame the yell of the savag and the shriek and groan of wound
and dy men that i heard the sweetest sound which ever fell upon my
earsth sound of shot be fire mani shot and quit close by
great heaven i scream the boer ar here to save us mari

and the bullet which had been meant for my heart pierc that of the
second thei both went down dead there in the doorwai
i snatch up on of their spear and glanc behind me mari wa
climb on to the chest i could just see her through the thicken
smoke anoth quabi rush on han and i receiv him on the point
of our assegai but so fierc wa hi charg that thei went through him
as though he were noth and be but light both of us were thrown
backward to the ground i scrambl to my feet again defenceless now
for the spear wa broken in the kaffir and await the end look
back onc more i saw that mari had either fail to get through the
window or abandon the attempt at ani rate she wa stand near the
chest support herself by her right hand in my despair i seiz the
blade end of the broken assegai and drag it from the bodi of the
kaffir think that it would serv to kill her then turn to do the
deed
but even as i turn i heard a voic that i knew well shout do you

slowli i back befor him for i could not speak and the last dread
effort of my will seem to thrust me toward mari i reach her and
threw my hand that still held the gori blade round her neck then as
dark came over me i heard her cry

after that i rememb no more nor did she for a while for we both fell
to the ground senseless
when my sens return to me i found myself ly on the floor of the
wagonhous in the back yard glanc from my halfopen ey for

by her stood a tall and dark young man whom i had never seen befor he
wa hold her hand and look at her anxious and even then i felt
angri with him also i saw other thing for instanc my old father
lean down and look at me anxious and outsid in the yard
for there were no door to the wagonhous a number of men with gun in

down and trembl all over not far from her the roan lai upon the
ground it flank quit red
i tri to rise and could not then feel pain in my left thigh
look and saw that it wa red also as a matter of fact an assegai had
gone half through it and hit upon the bone although i never felt it at
the time thi wound wa dealt to me by that great quabi whom han and
i had receiv upon our spear doubtless as he fell han by the wai
wa there also an aw and yet a ludicr spectacl for the quabi
had fallen right on the top of him and lain so with result that mai
be imagin there he sat upon the ground look upward gasp with
hi fishlik mouth each gasp i rememb fashion itself into the
word allemacht that is almighti a favourit dutch express
mari wa the first to perceiv that i had come to life again shake
herself free from the clasp of the young man she stagger toward me

chapter iv hernando pereira
sever more dai pass befor i wa allow out of that littl
warstain room of which i grew to hate the veri sight i entreat my
father to take me into the air but he would not sai that he fear
lest ani movement should caus the bleed to begin again or even the
cut arteri to burst moreov the wound wa not heal veri well
the spear that caus it have been dirti or perhap us to skin
dead anim which caus some dread of gangren that in those dai
gener meant death as it chanc although i wa treat onli with
cold water for antisept were then unknown my young and healthi
blood triumph and no gangren appear
what made those dai even duller wa that dure them i saw veri littl
of mari who now onli enter the place in the compani of her father
onc i manag to ask her why she did not come often and alon her
face grew troubl as she whisper back becaus it is not allow
allan and then without anoth word left the place
why i wonder to myself wa it not allow and an answer sprang
up in my mind doubtless it wa becaus of that tall young man who had
argu with my father in the wagonhous mari had never spoken to me
of him but from the hottentot han and my father i manag to collect a
good deal of inform concern him and hi busi
it appear that he wa the onli child of henri maraiss sister who
marri a portugues from delagoa bai of the name of pereira who had
come to the cape coloni to trade mani year befor and settl there
both he and hi wife were dead and their son hernando mari cousin
had inherit all their veri consider wealth
inde now i rememb have heard thi hernando or hernan as the
boer call him for short spoken of in past year by the heer marai
as the heir to great rich sinc hi father had made a larg fortun
by trade in wine and spirit under some govern monopoli which he
held often he had been invit to visit maraisfontein but hi parent
who dote on him and live in on of the settl district not far from
cape town would never allow him to travel so far from them into these
wild region
sinc their death howev thing had chang it appear that on the
deceas of old pereira the governor of the coloni had withdrawn the wine
and spirit monopoli which he said wa a job and a scandal an act that
made hernando pereira veri angri although he need no more monei and
had caus him to throw himself heart and soul into the scheme of the
disaffect boer inde he wa now engag as on of the organis
of the great trek which wa in contempl in fact it had alreadi
begun into the partial explor land beyond the border of the
coloni where the dutch farmer propos to set up dominion of their
own
that wa the stori of hernando pereira who wa to benai who had
alreadi becomemi rival for the hand of the sweet and beauti mari
marai
on night when my father and i were alon in the littl room where
he slept with me and he had finish read hi even portion of
scriptur aloud i pluck up my courag to tell him that i love mari
and wish to marri her and that we had plight our troth dure the
attack of the kaffir on the stead
love and war inde he said look at me grave but show no
sign of surpris for it appear that he wa alreadi acquaint with
our secret thi wa not wonder for he inform me afterward that
dure my delirium i had done noth except rave of mari in the most
endear term also mari herself when i wa at my worst had burst
into tear befor him and told him straight out that she love me
love and war inde he repeat ad kindli my poor boi i fear
that you have fallen into great troubl
why father i ask is it wrong that we should love each other
not wrong but in the circumst quit naturali should
have foreseen that it wa sure to happen no not wrong but most
unfortun to begin with i do not wish to see you marri a foreign
and becom mix up with these disloy boer i hope that on dai a
good mani year henc for you ar onli a boi allan you would find an
english wife and i still hope it
never i ejacul
never is a long word allan and i dare sai that what you ar so sure
is imposs will happen after all word that made me angri enough at
the time though in after year i often thought of them
but he went on put my own wish perhap prejudic asid
i think your suit hopeless although henri marai like you well enough
and is grate to you just now becaus you have save the daughter whom
he love you must rememb that he hate us english bitterli i believ
that he would almost as soon see hi girl marri a halfcast as an
englishman and especi a poor englishman as you ar and unless you
can make monei must remain i have littl to leav you allan
i might make monei father out of ivori for instanc you know i am a
good shot
allan i do not think you will ever make much monei it is not in your
blood or if you do you will not keep it we ar an old race and i
know our record up to the time of henri viii at ani rate not on of
us wa ever commerci success let us suppos howev that you
should prove yourself the except to the rule it cant be done at
onc can it fortun dont grow in a night like mushroom
no i suppos not father still on might have some luck
possibl but meanwhil you have to fight against a man who ha the
luck or rather the monei in hi pocket
what do you mean i ask sit up
i mean hernando pereira allan maraiss nephew who thei sai is on of
the richest men in the coloni i know that he wish to marri mari
how do you know it father
becaus marai told me so thi afternoon probabl with a purpos
he wa struck with her beauti when he first saw her after your escap
which he had not done sinc she wa a child and as he stop to guard
the hous while the rest went after the quabieswel you can guess
such thing go quickli with these southern men
i hid my face in the pillow bite my lip to keep back the groan
that wa readi to burst from them for i felt the hopeless of the
situat how could i compet with thi rich and fortun man who
natur would be favour of my betroth father then on the
black of my despair rose a star of hope i could not but perchanc
mari might she wa veri strongnatur and veri faith she wa not
to be bought and i doubt whether she could be frighten
father i said i mai never marri mari but i dont think that
hernando pereira ever will either
why not my boi
becaus she love me father and she is not on to chang i believ
that she would rather die
then she must be a veri unusu sort of woman still it mai be so the
futur will tell to those who live to see it i can onli prai and trust
that whatev happen will be for the best for both of you she is a
sweet girl and i like her well although she mai be boeror french and
now allan we have talk enough and you had better go to sleep you
must not excit yourself you know or it mai set up new inflamm in
the wound
go to sleep must not excit yourself i kept mutter those word
for hour serv them up in my mind with a spice of bitter thought at
last torpor or weak overcam me and i fell into a kind of net of
bad dream which thank heaven i have now forgotten yet when certain
event happen subsequ i alwai thought and inde still think
that these or someth like them had been a part of those evil dream
on the morn follow thi convers i wa at length allow to be
carri to the stoep where thei laid me down wrap in a veri
dirti blanket upon a rimpistrung bench or primit sofa when i had
satisfi my first delight at see the sun and breath the fresh
air i began to studi my surround in front of the hous or what
remain of it so arrang that the last of them at either end we made
fast to the extrem of the stoep wa arrang an arc of wagon
place as thei ar in a laager and protect underneath by earth thrown
up in a mound and by bough of the mimosa thorn evid these wagon
in which the guard of boer and arm nativ who still remain on
the place slept at night were set thu as a defenc against a possibl
attack by the quabi or other kaffir
dure the daytim howev the centr wagon wa drawn a littl on on
side to leav a kind of gate through thi open i saw that a long
wall also semicircular had been built outsid of them enclos a
space larg enough to contain at night all the cattl and hors that
were left to the heer marai togeth with those of hi friend who
evid did not wish to see their oxen vanish into the depth of the
mountain in the middl of thi extemporis kraal wa a long low
mound which as i learn afterward contain the dead who fell
in the attack on the hous the two slave who had been kill in the
defenc were buri in the littl garden that mari had made and the
headless bodi of leblanc in a small wall place to the right of the
stead where lai some of it former owner and on or two rel of
the heer marai includ hi wife
whilst i wa note these thing mari appear at the end of the
veranda have come round the burnt part of the hous follow by
hernan pereira catch sight of me she ran to the side of my couch
with outstretch arm as though she intend to embrac me then
seem to rememb stop suddenli at my side colour to her hair
and said in an embarrass voic
oh heer allansh had never call me heer in her life beforei am
so glad to find you out how have you been get on
pretti well i thank you i answer bite my lip as you would
have learnt mari had you come to see me
next moment i wa sorri for the word for i saw her ey fill with
tear and her breast shake with someth like a sob howev it wa
pereira and not mari who answer for at the moment i believ she
could not speak
my good boi he said in a pompou patronis wai and in english
which he knew perfectli i think that my cousin ha had plenti to do
care for all these peopl dure the last few dai without run to
look at the cut in your leg howev i am glad to hear from your worthi
father that it is almost well and that you will soon be abl to plai
game again like other of your ag
now it wa my turn to be unabl to speak and to feel my ey fill with
tear tear of rage for rememb that i wa still veri feebl but
mari spoke for me
ye cousin hernan she said in a cold voic thank god the heer
allan quatermain will soon be abl to plai game again such bloodi
game as the defenc of maraisfontein with eight men against all the
quabi hord then heaven help those who stand in front of hi rifl
and she glanc at the mound that cover the dead kaffir mani of
whom as a matter of fact i had kill
oh no offenc no offenc mari said pereira in hi smooth rich
voic i did not want to laugh at your young friend who doubtless is
as brave as thei sai all englishmen ar and who fought well when he wa
lucki enough to have the chanc of protect you my dear cousin but
after all you know he is not the onli on who can hold a gun straight
as you seem to think which i shall be happi to prove to him in a
friendli fashion when he is stronger
here he step forward a pace and look down at me then ad with a
laugh allemacht i fear that wont be just at present why the lad
look as though on might blow him awai like a feather
still i said noth onli glanc up at thi tall and splendid man
stand abov me in hi fine cloth for he wa richli dress as the
fashion of the time went with hi high colour broad shoulder and
face full of health and vigour mental i compar him with myself
as i wa after my fever and loss of blood a poor whitefac rat of
a lad with stubbl brown hair on my head and onli a littl down on my
chin with arm like stick and a dirti blanket for raiment how could
i compar with him in ani wai what chanc had i against thi opul
bulli who hate me and all my race and in whose hand even if i were
well i should be noth but a child
and yet and yet as i lai there humili and a mock an answer came
into my mind and i felt that whatev might be the case with my outward
form in spirit in courag in determin and in abil in all
in short that realli make a man i wa more than pereira equal ye
and that by the help of these qualiti poor as i wa and frail as i
seem to be i would beat him at the last and keep for myself what i
had won the prize of mari love
such were the thought which pass through me and i think that
someth of the tenor of them commun itself to mari who often
could read my heart befor my lip spoke at ani rate her demeanour
chang she drew herself up her fine nostril expand and a proud
look came into her dark ey as she nod her head and murmur in a
voic so low that i think i alon caught her word
ye ye have no fear
pereira wa speak again he had turn asid to strike the steel of
hi tinderbox and wa now blow the spark to a glow befor light
hi big pipe
by the wai heer allan he said that is a veri good mare of your

maraisfontein in wonder time as for the matter of that the

if he ha not brought down the full six doe the heer pereira accept
if so i will ventur to match myself against him although he ha won

the boer began to laugh at him in the end he grew rather angri and
said that he wa will to shoot me at buck or swallow or firefli
or anyth els i like
then let it be at gees i answer sinc it is like to be
sometim befor i am strong enough to ride after buck or other wild
thing
so the term of the match were formal written down by mari as my
father although he took a keen sport interest in the result would
have noth to do with what he call a wager for monei and except
myself there wa no on els present with suffici scholarship to
pen a long document then we both sign them hernan pereira not veri
willingli i thought and if my recoveri wa suffici rapid the
date wa fix for that dai week in case of ani disagr the heer
retief who wa stai at maraisfontein or in it neighbourhood for a
while wa appoint refere and stakehold it wa also arrang that
neither of us should visit the appoint place or shoot at the gees
befor the match still we were at liberti to practis as much as we
like at anyth els in the interv and to make us of ani kind of
rifl that suit us best
by the time that these arrang were finish feel quit tire
with all the emot of the morn i wa carri back to my room
here my middai meal cook by mari wa brought to me as i finish
eat it for the fresh air had given me an appetit my father came
in accompani by the heer marai and began to talk to me present
the latter ask me kindli enough if i thought i should be suffici
strong to trek back to the station that afternoon in an oxcart with
spring to it and ly at full length upon a hidestrung cartel or
mattress
i answer certainli as i should have done had i been at the point
of death for i saw that he wish to be rid of me
the fact is allan he said awkwardli i am not inhospit as you
mai think especi toward on to whom i ow so much but you and my
nephew hernan do not seem to get on veri well togeth and as you
mai guess have just been almost beggar i desir no unpleas
with the onli rich member of my famili
i repli i wa sure i did not wish to be the caus of ani it seem
to me howev that the heer pereira wish to make a mock of me and to
bring it home to me what a poor creatur i wa compar to himselfi a
mere sick boi who wa worth noth
i know said marai uneasili my nephew ha been too fortun in
life and is somewhat overbear in hi manner he doe not rememb
that the battl is not alwai to the strong or the race to the swift he
who is young and rich and handsom a spoil child from the first i
am sorri but what i cannot help i must put up with if i cannot have my
meali cook i must eat them green also allan have you never heard
that jealousi sometim make peopl rude and unjust and he look at
me meaningli
i made no answer for when on doe not quit know what to sai it is
often best to remain silent and he went on
i am vex to hear of thi foolish shoot match which ha been
enter into without my knowledg or consent if he win he will onli
laugh at you the more and if you win he will be angri
it wa not my fault mynheer i answer he want to forc me
to sell the mare which he had been ride without my leav and kept
brag about hi marksmanship so at last i grew cross and challeng
him
no wonder allan i do not blame you still you ar silli for it will
not matter to him if he lose hi monei but that beauti mare is your
ewelamb and i should be sorri to see you part from a beast which ha
done us so good a turn well there it is perhap circumst mai yet
put an end to thi trial i hope so
i hope thei wont i answer stubbornli
i dare sai you do be sore as a gall hors just now but listen
allan and you too prdicant quatermain there ar other and more
import reason than thi petti squabbl why i should be glad if you
could go awai for a while i must take counsel with my countrymen about
certain secret matter which have to do with our welfar and futur
and of cours thei would not like it if all the while there were two
englishmen on the place whom thei might think were spi
sai no more heer marai broke in my father hotli still less should
we like to be where we ar not want or ar look upon with suspicion
for the crime of be english by god bless my son ha been abl
to do some servic to you and your but now that is all finish and
forgotten let the cart you ar so kind as to lend us be inspan we
will go at onc
then henri marai who wa a gentleman at bottom although even
in those earli dai violent and foolish when excit or under the
influenc of hi race prejudic began to apologis quit humbl
assur my father that he forgot noth and meant no offenc so thei
patch the matter up and an hour later we start
all the boer came to see us off give me mani kind word and sai
how much thei look forward to meet me again on the follow
thursdai pereira who wa among them wa also veri genial beg me
to be sure and get well sinc he did not wish to beat on who wa still
crippl even at a game of goos shoot i answer that i would do
my best as for my part i did not like be beaten it ani game which
i had set my heart on win whether it were littl or big then
i turn my head for i wa ly on my back all thi time to bid
goodby to mari who had slip out of the hous into the yard where
the cart wa
goodby allan she said give me her hand and a look from her
ey that i trust wa not seen then under pretenc of arrang the
kaross which wa over me she bent down and whisper swiftli
win that match if you love me i shall prai god that you mai everi
night for it will be an omen
i think the whisper wa heard though not the word for i saw pereira
bite hi lip and make a movement as though to interrupt her but pieter
retief thrust hi big form in front of him rather rude and said with
on of hi hearti laugh
allemacht friend let the missj wish a good journei to the young
fellow who save her life
next moment han the hottentot scream at the oxen in the usual
fashion and we roll awai through the gate
but oh if i had like the heer retief befor now i love him
chapter v the shoot match
my journei back to the mission station wa a strang contrast to that
which i had made thenc a few dai befor then the dark the swift
mare beneath me rush through it like a bird the aw terror in my
heart lest i should be too late as with wild ey i watch the pale
star and the first gather grei of dawn now the creak of the
oxcart the familiar veld the bright glow of the peac sunlight
and in my heart a great thank and yet a new terror lest the pure
and holi love which i had won should be stolen awai from me by forc or
fraud
well as the on matter had been in the hand of god so wa the other
and with that knowledg i must be content the first trial had end in
death and victori how would the second end i wonder and those word
seem to jumbl themselv up in my mind and shape a sentenc that it
did not conceiv it wa in the victori that is death which when
i came to think of it of cours meant noth how victori could be
death i did not understandat ani rate at that time i who wa but a
lad of small experi
as we trek along comfort enough for the road wa good and the
cart be on spring gave my leg no pain i ask my father what he
thought that the heer marai had meant when he told us that the boer
had busi at maraisfontein dure which our presenc as englishmen
would not be agreeabl to them
meant allan he meant that these traitor dutchmen ar plot
against their sovereign and ar afraid lest we should report their
treason either thei intend to rebel becaus of that most righteou
act the free of the slave and becaus we will not kill out all the
kaffir with whom thei chanc to quarrel or to trek from the coloni
for my part i think it will be the latter for as you have heard some
parti have alreadi gone and unless i am mistaken mani more mean
to follow marai and retief and that plotter pereira among them
let them go i sai the sooner the better for i have no doubt that the
english flag will follow them in due cours
i hope that thei wont i answer with a nervou laugh at ani rate
until i have won back my mare i had left her in retief care as
stakehold until the match should be shot off
for the rest of that two and a half hour trek my father look veri
dignifi and patriot declaim to me loudli about the bad behaviour
of the boer who hate and traduc missionari loath and
abomin british rule and perman offici love slaveri and
kill kaffir whenev thei got the chanc i listen to him polit
for it wa not wise to cross my parent when he wa in that humour also
have mix a great deal with the dutch i knew that there wa anoth
side to the question name that the missionari sometim traduc
them as in fact thei did and that british rule or rather
parti govern plai strang trick with the interest of distant
depend that perman offici and imperman on toosuch
as governor full of a littl brief authorityoften misrepres and
oppress them that kaffir encourag by the varieg polici of
these parti govern and their servant frequent stole their
stock and if thei found a chanc murder them with their women and
children as thei had tri to do at maraisfontein though there it is
true thei had some provoc that british virtu had liber the
slave without pai their owner a fair price for them and so forth
but to tell the truth it wa not of these matter of high polici
which were far enough awai from a humbl youth like myself that i wa
think what appeal to me and made my heart sick wa the reflect
that if henri marai and hi friend trek mari marai must perforc
trek with them and that wherea i an englishman could not be of that
adventur compani hernando pereira both could and would
on the dai follow our arriv home what between the fresh air
plenti of good food for which i found i had an appetit and liber
dose of pontaca gener cape wine that is a kind of cross between
port and burgundyi found myself so much better that i wa abl to hop
about the place upon a pair of crutch which han improvis for me
out of kaffir stick next morn my improv continu at a rapid
rate i turn my attent serious to the shoot match for which i
had but five dai to prepar
now it chanc that some month befor a young englishman of good
familyh wa name the honour vavasseur smythwho had accompani
an offici rel to the cape coloni came our wai in search of
sport of which i wa abl to show him a good deal of a humbl kind
he had brought with him amongst other weapon what in those dai wa
consid a veri beauti hairtrigg smallbor rifl fit with
a nippl for percuss cap then quit a new invent it wa by a
maker of the name of j purdei of london and had cost quit a larg
sum becaus of the perfect of it workmanship when the honour
v smythof whom i have never heard sincetook hi leav of us on
hi departur for england be a generousheart young fellow as a
souvenir of himself he kindli present me with thi rifl which i
still have
thi singlebarrel percussioncap rifl describ by
allan quatermain which figur so promin in the
histori of thi epoch of hi life ha been sent to me by
mr curti and is befor me as i write it wa made in the
year 1835 by j purdei of 314 12 oxford street london
and is a beauti piec of workmanship of it kind without
the ramrod which is now miss it weigh onli 5 lb 3
34 oz the barrel is octagon and the rifl bore
design to take a spheric bullet is 12 in in diamet
the hammer can be set to safeti on the halfcock by mean of
a catch behind it
anoth peculiar of the weapon on that i have never
seen befor is that by press on the back of the trigger
the ordinari light pull of the piec is so reduc that the
merest touch suffic to fire it thu render it hair
trigger in the fullest sens of the word
it ha two flapsight mark for 150 and 200 yard in
addit to the fix sight design for fire at 100
yard
on the lock ar engrav a stag and a doe the first ly
down and the second stand
of it sort and period it is an extraordinarili wellmad
and handi gun finish with horn at the end of what is now
call the tongu and with the stock cut awai so as to
leav a rais cushion against which the cheek of the
shooter rest
what charg it took i do not know but i should imagin from
2 12 to 3 drachm of powder it is easi to understand that
in the hand of allan quatermain thi weapon obsolet as it
is todai wa capabl of great thing within the limit of
it rang and that the faith he put in it at the trial of
skill at the groot kloof and afterward in the fear
ordeal of the shoot of the vultur on the wing upon the
mount of slaughter when the live of mani hung upon hi
marksmanship wa well justifi thi inde is shown by
the result in both case
in write of thi rifl messr purdei inform me that
copper percuss cap were experi with by colonel
forsyth in 1820 and that their firm sold them in 1824 at a
cost of 1 15 per 1000 although their us did not becom
gener until some year laterth editor
that wa about six month earlier than the time of which i write and
dure those month i had often us thi rifl for the shoot of
game such as blesbuck and also of bustard i found it to be a weapon
of the most extraordinari accuraci up to a rang of about two hundr
yard though when i rode off in that desper hurri for maraisfontein
i did not take it with me becaus it wa a singl barrel and too small
in the bore to load with looper at a pinch still in challeng
pereira it wa thi gun and no other that i determin to us inde
had i not own it i do not think that i should have ventur on the
match
as it happen mr smyth had left me with the rifl a larg suppli of
special cast bullet and of the new percuss cap to sai noth of
some veri fine import powder therefor have ammunit in plenti
i set to work to practis seat myself upon a chair in a deep kloof
near the station across which rock pigeon and turtl dove were wont
to fly in number at a consider height i began to fire at them as
thei flash over me
now in my ag i mai sai without fear of be set down a boaster that
i have on gift that of marksmanship which i suppos i ow to some
curiou combin of judgment quick of ey and steadi of
hand i can declar honestli that in my best dai i never knew a man who
could beat me in shoot at a live object i sai noth of target
work of which i have littl experi oddli enough also i believ
that at thi art although then i lack the practic which sinc ha
come to me in such plenti i wa as good as a youth as i have ever been
in later dai and of cours far better than i am now thi i soon
prove upon the present occas for seat there in that kloof after
a few trial i found that i could bring down quit a number of even the
swift straightfli rock pigeon as thei sped over me and thi be
it rememb not with shot but with a singl bullet a feat that mani
would hold to be incred
so the dai pass and i practis everi even find me a littl
better at thi terribl difficult sport for alwai i learn more as
to the exact capac of my rifl and the allow that must be made
accord to the speed of the bird it distanc and the complic
of the wind and of the light dure those dai also i recov so
rapidli that at the end of them i wa almost in my normal condit and
could walk well with the aid of a singl stick
at length the event thursdai came and about middayfor i lai in bed
late that morn and did not shooti drove or rather wa driven in
a cape cart with two hors to the place known as groot kloof or great
gulli over thi gorg the wild gees flight from their pan or
feed ground on the high land abov to other pan that lai some
mile below and thenc i suppos straight out to the sea coast
whenc thei return at dawn
on arriv at the mouth of groot kloof about four oclock in the
afternoon my father and i were astonish to see a great number of
boer assembl there and among them a certain sprinkl of their
younger womankind who had come on horseback or in cart
good graciou i said to my father if i had known there wa to be
such a fuss as thi about a shoot match i dont think i could have
face it
hum he answer i think there is more in the wind than your match
unless i am much mistaken it ha been made the excus of a public
meet in a seclud spot so as to throw the author off the
scent
as a matter of fact my father wa quit right befor we arriv there
that dai the major of those boer after full and long discuss
had arrang to shake the dust of the coloni off their feet and find a
home in new land to the north
present we were among them and i notic that on and all their
face were anxiou and preoccupi pieter retief caught sight of me
be help out of the cart by my father and han whom i had brought
to load and for a moment look puzzl evid hi thought were
far awai then he rememb and exclaim in hi jolli voic
why here is our littl englishman come to shoot off hi match like a
man of hi word friend marai stop talk about your lossesthi in
a warn voiceand give him good dai
so marai came and with him mari who blush and smile but to my
mind look more of a grown woman than ever befor on who had left
girlhood behind her and found herself face to face with real life and
all it troubl follow her close veri close as i wa quick to
notic wa hernan pereira he wa even more fine dress than usual
and carri in hi hand a beauti new singlebarrel rifl also
fit to take percuss cap but as i thought of a veri larg bore
for the purpos of goos shoot
so you have got well again he said in a genial voic that yet did not
ring true inde it suggest to me that he wish i had done noth
of the sort well mynheer allan here you find me quit readi to shoot
your head off he didnt mean that though i dare sai he wa i
tell you that the mare is as good as mine for i have been practis
havent i mari as the aasvogel that is vultur round the
stead know to their cost
ye cousin hernan said mari you have been practis but so
perhap ha allan
by thi time all the compani of boer had collect round us and began
to evinc a great interest in the pend contest as wa natur among
peopl who rare had a gun out of their hand and thought that fine
shoot wa the divinest of the art howev thei were not allow
to stai long as the kaffir said that the gees would begin their
afternoon flight within about half an hour so the spectat were all
request to arrang themselv under the sheer cliff of the kloof
where thei could not be seen by the bird come over them from behind
and there to keep silenc then pereira and ii attend by my loader
but he alon as he said a man at hi elbow would bother himand with
us retief the refere took our station about a hundr and fifti
yard from thi face of cliff here we screen ourselv as well as
we could from the keen sight of the bird behind some tall bush which
grew at thi spot
i seat myself on a campstool which i had brought with me for my
leg wa still too weak to allow me to stand long and wait present
pereira said through retief that he had a favour to ask name that
i would allow him to take the first six shot as the strain of wait
made him nervou i answer certainli although i knew well that
the object of the request wa that he believ that the outpost
geesespygees we call themwhich would be the first to arriv
would probabl come over low down and slow wherea those that follow
scent danger might fly high and fast thi in fact prove to be
the case for there is no bird more clever than the misnam goos
when we had wait about a quarter of an hour han said
hist goos come
as he spoke though as yet i could not see the bird i heard it cry of
honk honk and the swish of it strong wing
then it appear an old spurwing gander probabl the king of the
flock fly so low that it onli clear the cliff edg by about twenti
feet and pass over not more than thirti yard up an easi shot
pereira fire and down it came rather slowli fall a hundr yard
or so behind him while retief said
on for our side
pereira load again and just as he had cap hi rifl three more
gees also fly low came over preced by a number of duck
pass straight abov us as thei must do ow to the shape of the gap
between the land wave of the veld abov through which thei flight
pereira shot and to my surpris the second not the first bird fell
also a good wai behind him
did you shoot at that goos or the other nephew ask retief
at that on for sure he answer with a laugh
he li mutter the hottentot he shot at the first and kill the
second
be silent i answer who would lie about such a thing
again pereira load by the time that he wa readi more gees were
approach thi time in a triangl of seven bird their leader be
at the point of the triangl which wa fly higher than those that
had gone befor he fire and down came not on bird but two name
the captain and the goos to the right of and a littl behind it
ah uncl exclaim pereira did you see those bird cross each
other as i pull that wa a lucki on for me but i wont count the
second if the heer allan object
no i did not nephew answer retief but doubtless thei must have
done so or the same bullet could not have pierc both
both han and i onli look at each other and laugh still we said
noth
from the spectat under the cliff there came a murmur of
congratul not unmix with astonish again pereira load
aim and loos at a rather high gooseit mai have been about seventi
yard in the air he struck it right enough for the feather flew from
it breast but to my astonish the bird after swoop down as
though it were go to fall recov itself and flew awai straight
out of sight
tough bird these gees exclaim pereira thei can carri as much
lead as a seacow
veri tough inde answer retief doubtfulli never befor did i see
a bird fly awai with an ounc ball through it middl
oh he will drop dead somewher repli pereira as he ram hi
powder down
within four minut more pereira had fire hi two remain shot
select as he wa entitl to do low and easi young gees that came
over him slowli he kill them both although the last of them after
fall waddl along the ground into a tuft of high grass
now murmur of stifl applaus broke from the audienc to which
pereira bow in acknowledg
you will have to shoot veri well mynheer allan said retief to me
if you want to beat that even if i rule out on of the two bird that
fell to a singl shot as i think i shall hernan ha kill five out of
six which can scarc be better
ye i answer but mynheer be so good as to have those gees
collect and put upon on side i dont want them mix up with mine
if i am lucki enough to bring ani down
he nod and some kaffir were sent to bring in the gees sever of
these i note were still flap and had to have their neck twist
but at the time i did not go to look at them while thi wa be done
i call to retief and beg him to examin the powder and bullet i
wa about to us
what the good he ask look at me curious powder is powder
and a bullet is a bullet
none i dare sai still oblig me by look at them my uncl
then at my bid han took six bullet and place them in hi hand
beg him to return them to us as thei were want
thei must be a great deal smaller than hernan said retief who
be stronger us a heavier gun
ye i answer briefli as han put the charg of powder into the
rifl and drove home the wad then take a bullet from retief hand
he ram that down on to the top of it cap the gun and hand it
to me
by now the gees were come thick for the flight wa at it full
onli either becaus some of those that had alreadi pass had sight
the kaffir collect the fallen bird and risenan exampl which
the other note from afar and followedor becaus in an unknown wai
warn of their danger had been convei to them thei were fly
higher and faster than the first arriv
you will have the worst of it allan said retief it should have
been shot and shot about
perhap i answer but that cant be help now
then i rose from my stool the rifl in my hand i had not long to wait
for present over came a wedg of gees nearli a hundr yard up i
aim at the first fellow hold about eight yard ahead of him to
allow for hi pace and press next second i heard the clap of the
bullet but ala it had onli struck the outstretch beak of which
a small portion fell to the ground the bird itself after waver
a second resum it place as leader of the squad and pass awai
appar unharm
baa baa whisper han as he seiz the rifl and began to
reload you were too far in front these big waterbird do not travel
as fast as the rock pigeon
i nod wish to save my breath then quiver with excit
for if i miss the next shot the match appear to be lost present i
took the rifl from hi hand
scarc had i done so when a singl goos came over quit as high as
the other and travel as though the black devil had kick it as
retief said thi time i allow the same space to compens for the
object increas speed and press
down it came like a stone fall but a littl wai behind me with it
head knock off
baa baa whisper han still too far in front why aim at the
ey when you have the whole bodi
again i nod and at the same time heav a sigh of relief at least
the match wa still aliv soon a larg flight came over mix up with
mallard and widgeon i took the righthand angl bird so that it could
not be suppos i had brown the lot as here in england thei sai
of on who fire at a covei and not at a particular partridg down he
came shot straight through the breast then i knew that i had got my
nerv and felt no more fear
to cut a long stori short although two of them were extrem difficult
and high on be i should sai quit a hundr and twenti yard
abov me and the other by no mean easi i kill the next three bird
on after the other and i verili believ could have kill a dozen more
without a miss for now i wa shoot as i had never shot befor
sai nephew allan ask retief curious in the paus between
the fifth and sixth shot why do your gees fall so differ to
hernan
ask him dont talk to me i answer and next instant brought down
number five the finest shot of the lot
a sound of wonder and applaus came from all the audienc and i saw
mari wave a white handkerchief
that the end said the refere
on minut befor you stir i answer i want to shoot at someth
els that is not in the match just to see if i can kill two bird with
on bullet like the heer pereira
he grant my request with a nod hold up hi hand to prevent the
audienc from move and bid pereira who tri to interrupt to be
silent
now while the match wa in progress i had notic two falcon about
the size of the british peregrin wheel round and round high over the
kloof in which doubtless thei bred appar quit undisturb by
the shoot or perhap thei had their ey upon some of the fallen
gees i took the rifl and wait for a long while till at last my
opportun came i saw that the larger hen falcon wa about to cross
directli over the circl of it mate there be perhap a distanc of
ten yard between them i aim i judgedfor a second my mind wa a
kind of calcul machineth differ arc and speed of the bird
must be allow for and the lowest wa nineti yard awai then with
someth like a prayer upon my lip i press while everi ey stare
upward
down came the lower falcon a paus of half a second and down came the
higher on also fall dead upon it dead mate
now even from those boer who did not love to see an englishman excel
there broke a shout of acclam never had thei beheld such a shot as
thi nor in truth had i
mynheer retief i said i gave you notic that i intend to try to
kill both of them did i not
you did allemacht you did but tell me allan quatermain ar your
ey and hand quit human
you must ask my father i answer with a shrug as i sat myself down
upon my stool and mop my brow
the boer came up with a rush mari fly ahead of them like a
swallow and their stout womenfolk waddl behind and form a circl
round us all talk at onc i did not listen to their convers
till i heard pereira who wa engag in some eyeplai with mari sai
in a loud voic
ye it wa pretti veri pretti but all the same uncl retief i
claim the match as i shot six gees against five
han i said bring my gees and thei were brought each with a
neat hole through it and laid down near those that pereira had shot
now i said to retief examin the wound in these bird and then
that on the second bird which the heer pereira kill when he brought
down two at onc i think it will be found that hi bullet must have
splinter
retief went and studi all the bird take them up on by on then
he threw down the last with a curs and cri in a great voic
mynheer pereira why do you bring shame on us befor these two
englishmen i sai that you have been us looper or els bullet that
were sawn in quarter and glu or ti with thread look look and he
point to the wound of which in on case there were as mani as three
on a singl bird
why not answer pereira coolli the bargain wa that we were to us
bullet but it wa never said that thei should not be cut doubtless
the heer allan were treat in the same wai
no i answer when i said that i would shoot with a bullet i meant
a whole bullet not on that had been sawn in piec and fix togeth
again so that after it left the muzzl it might spread out like shot
but i do not wish to talk about the matter it is in the hand of the
heer pieter retief who will give judgment as it pleas him
now much excit argument ensu among the boer in the midst of which
mari manag to whisper to me unheard
oh i am glad allan for whatev thei mai decid you won and the
omen is good
i dont see what gees have to do with omen sweetheart i
answeredthat is sinc the time of the ancient roman anyhow
i should sai that the omen ar bad for there is go to be a row
present
just then retief put up hi hand call out
silenc i have decid the write of the match did not sai that the
bullet were not to be cut and therefor hernan pereira bird must
count but that write doe sai that ani bird accident kill
should not count and therefor on goos must be subtract from
pereira total which leav the two shooter equal so either the
match is dead or sinc the gees have ceas to come it must be shot
off anoth dai
oh if there is ani question said pereira who felt that public
opinion wa much against him let the englishman take the monei i dare
sai that he need it as the son of missionari ar not rich
there is no question i said sinc rich or poor not for a thousand
pound would i shoot again against on who plai such trick keep your
monei mynheer pereira and i will keep my mare the umpir ha said
that the match is dead so everyth is finish
not quit interrupt retief for i have a word to sai friend
allan you have plai fair and i believ that there is no on who can
shoot like you in africa
that is so said the audienc of boer
mynheer pereira went on retief although you too ar a fine shot

when all were seat and we men had lit our pipe though apprehens
of what wa to follow quit took awai my tast for smoke marai spoke

of my father who made it a point of honour not to understand dutch

french to mari it wa a most curiou and polyglot convers

matter accord to hi will henri marai listen he went on after
a paus for marai made no answer but sat himself down and stare
gloomili at the tabl you do not wish my son to marri your daughter
for variou reason of which on is that you think him poor and a
richer suitor ha offer himself after a revers of fortun ha made
you poor anoth and a greater the true reason is hi english
blood which you hate so much that although by god merci he save her
life you do not desir that he should share her life is it not true
ye it is true mynheer quatermain you english ar bulli and
cheat he answer excitedli
and so you would give your daughter to on who ha shown himself humbl
and upright to that good hater of the english and plotter against hi
king hernando pereira whom you love becaus he alon is left of your
ancient race
rememb the incid of the afternoon thi sarcasm reduc marai
to silenc
well went on my father although i am fond of mari and know her
to be a sweet and nobleheart girl neither do i wish that she should
marri my son i would see him wed to some english woman and not drag
into the net of the boer and their plot still it is plain that
these two love each other with heart and soul as doubtless it ha
been decre that thei should love thi be so i tell you that to
separ them and forc anoth marriag upon on of them is a crime
befor god of which i am sure he will take note and pai it back to
you strang thing mai happen in those land whither you go henri
marai will you not then be content to leav your child in safe
keep
never shout marai she shall accompani me to a new home which is
not under the shadow of your accurs british flag
then i have no more to sai on your head be it here and hereaft
repli my father solemnli
now unabl to control myself ani longer i broke in
but i have mynheer to separ mari and myself is a sin and on
that will break her heart as for my poverti i have someth more
perhap than you think and in thi rich countri wealth can be earn
by those who work as i would do for her sake the man to whom you would
give her show hi true natur thi dai for he who can plai so low
a trick to win a wager will plai wors trick to win greater thing
moreov the scheme must fail sinc mari will not marri him
i sai she shall repli marai and that whether she doe or not
she shall accompani me and not stai here to be the wife of an english
boi
accompani you i will father and share your fortun to the last but
marri hernando pereira i will not said mari quietli
perhap mynheer i ad dai mai come when onc again you will be
glad of the help of an english boi
the word were spoken at random a kind of ejacul from the heart
caus by the sting of maraiss cruelti and insult like the cry of a
beast beneath a blow littl did i know how true thei would prove but
at time it is thu that truth is mysteri drawn from some well of
secret knowledg hidden in our soul
when i want your help i will ask for it rave marai who know
himself to be in the wrong strove to cover up that wrong with violenc
ask or unask if i live it shall be given in the futur as in the
past mynheer marai god pardon you for the woe you ar bring on
mari and on me
now mari began to weep a littl and unabl to bear that sight i
cover my ey with my hand marai who when he wa not under the
influenc of hi prejudic or passion had a kind heart wa move
also but tri to hide hi feel in rough he swore at mari
and told her to go to bed and she obei still weep then my father
rose and said
henri marai we cannot leav here tonight becaus the hors ar
kraal and it would be difficult to find them in thi dark so we
must ask your hospit till dawn
i do not ask it i exclaim i go to sleep in the cart and i
limp from the room and the hous leav the two men togeth
what pass afterward between them i do not quit know i gather
that my father who when rous also had a temper and wa mental
and intellectu the stronger man told marai hi opinion of hi
wicked and folli in languag that he wa not like to forget
i believ he even drove him to confess that hi act seem cruel
excus them howev by announc that he had sworn befor god that
hi daughter should never marri an englishman also he said that he had
promis her solemnli to pereira hi own nephew whom he love and
could not break hi word
no answer my father becaus be mad with the mad that run
befor destruct you prefer to break mari heart and perhap becom
guilti of her blood
then he left him
the dark wa intens through it i grope my wai to the cart which
stood where it had been outspan on the veld at a littl distanc from
the hous wish heartili so miser wa i that the kaffir might
choos that black night for anoth attack and make an end of me
when i reach it and lit the lantern which we alwai carri i wa
astonish to find that in a rough fashion it had been made readi to
sleep in the seat had been clear out the hind curtain fasten and
so forth also the pole wa prop up with an oxyok so as to make the
vehicl level to lie in while i wa wonder vagu who could have
done thi han climb on to the step carri two kaross which he
had borrow or stolen and ask if i wa comfort
oh ye i answer but why were you go to sleep in the cart
baa he repli i wa not i prepar it for you how did i know
that you were come oh veri simpli i sat on the stoep and listen
to all the talk in the sitkamm the window ha never been mend
baa sinc the quabi broke it god in heaven what a talk that wa
i never knew that white peopl could have so much to sai about a simpl
matter you want to marri the baa maraiss daughter the baa want her
to marri anoth man who can pai more cattl well among us it would
soon have been settl for the father would have taken a stick and
beaten you out of the hut with the thick end then he would have beaten
the girl with the thin end until she promis to take the other man and
all would have been settl nice but you white you talk and talk
and noth is settl you still mean to marri the daughter and the
daughter still mean not to marri the man of mani cow moreov the
father ha realli gain noth except a sick heart and much bad luck
to come
why much bad luck to come han i ask idli for hi nave sum
up of the case interest me in a vagu wai
oh baa allan for two reason first your reverend father who made
me true christian told him so and a prdicant so good as he is on
down whom the curs of god run from heaven like lightn run down a
tree well the heer marai wa sit under that tree and we all know
what happen to him who is under a tree when the lightn strike it
that my first christian reason my second blackman reason about which
there can be no mistak for it ha alwai been true sinc there wa a
black man is that the girl is your by blood you save her life with
your blood and he point to my leg and therefor bought her for
ever for blood is more than cattl therefor too he who would divid
her from you bring blood on her and on the other man who tri to steal
her blood blood and on himself i know not what and he wave hi
yellow arm stare up at me with hi littl black ey in a wai that
wa most uncanni
nonsens i said why do you talk such bad word
becaus thei ar true word baa allan oh you laugh at the poor
totti but i had it from my father and he from hi father from
gener to gener amen and you will see you will see as i
have seen befor now and as the heer marai will see who if the great
god had not made him madfor mad he is baa as we know if you white
dontmight have live in hi home till he wa old and have had a good
soninlaw to buri him in hi blanket
now i seem to have had enough of thi eeri convers of cours it
is easi to laugh at nativ and their superstit but after a long
life of experi i am bound to admit that thei ar not alwai devoid
of truth the nativ ha some kind of sixth sens which the civilis
man ha lost or so it seem to me
talk of blanket i said in order to chang the subject from whom
did you get these kaross
from whom why from the missi of cours baa when i heard that you
were to sleep in the cart i went to her and borrow them to cover
you also i had forgotten she gave me a write for you and he felt
about first in hi dirti shirt then under hi arm and final in hi
fuzzi hair from which last hide place he produc a littl bit of
paper fold into a pellet i undid it and read these word written
with a pencil and in french
i shall be in the peach orchard half an hour befor sunris be there
if you would bid me farewellm
is there ani answer baa ask han when i had thrust the note
into my pocket if so i can take it without be found out then an
inspir seem to strike him and he ad why do you not take it
yourself the missi window is easi to open also i am sure she would
be pleas to see you
be silent i said i am go to sleep wake me an hour befor the
cockcrowand stayse that the hors have got out of the kraal
so that you cannot find them too easili in case the reverend wish to
start veri earli but do not let them wander far for here we ar no
welcom guest
ye baa by the wai baa the heer pereira who tri to cheat you
over those gees is sleep in an empti hous not more than two mile
awai he drink coffe when he wake up in the morn and hi servant
who make it is my good friend now would you like me to put a littl
someth into it not to kill him for that is against the law in the
book but just to make him quit mad for the book sai noth about
that if so i have a veri good medicin on that you white peopl do
not know which improv the tast of the coffe and it might save much
troubl you see if he came danc about the place without ani cloth
on like a common kaffir the heer marai although he is realli mad
also might not wish for him as a soninlaw
oh go to the devil if you ar not there alreadi i repli and
turn over as though to sleep
there wa no need for me to have instruct that faith creatur the
astut but immor han to call me earli as the ladi did her mother in
the poem for i do not think that i close an ey that night i spare
my reflect for thei can easili be imagin in the case of an
earnestnatur lad who wa about to be bereft of hi first love
long befor the dawn i stood in the peach orchard that orchard where
we had first met and wait at length mari came steal between
the tree trunk like a grei ghost for she wa wrap in some
lightcolour garment oh onc more we were alon togeth alon in
the utter solitud and silenc which preced the african dawn when all
creatur that love the night have withdrawn to their lair and hide
place and those that love the dai still sleep their soundest
she saw me and stood still then open her arm and clasp me to her
breast utter no word a while later she spoke almost in a whisper
sai
allan i must not stai long for i think that if my father found us
togeth he would shoot you in hi mad
now as alwai it wa of me she thought not of herself
and you my sweet i ask
oh she answer that matter noth except for the sin of it i
wish he would shoot me for then i should have done with all thi pain
i told you allan when the kaffir were on us yonder that it might be
better to die and see my heart spoke truli
is there no hope i gasp will he realli separ us and take you
awai into the wilder
certainli noth can turn him yet allan there is thi hope in two
year if i live i shall be of full ag and can marri whom i will and
thi i swear that i will marri none but you no not even if you were
to die tomorrow
i bless you for those word i said
why she ask simpli what other could i speak would you have me
do outrag to my own heart and go through life faithless and asham
and i i swear also i broke in
nai swear noth while i live i know that you will love me and if
i should be taken it is my wish that you should marri some other good
woman sinc it is not well or right that man should live alon with
us maid it is differ listen allan for the cock ar begin to
crow and soon there will be light you must bide here with your father
if possibl i will write to you from time to time tell you where
we ar and how we fare but if i do not write know that it is becaus i
cannot or becaus i can find no messeng or becaus the letter have
miscarri for we go into wild countri amongst savag
whither do you go i ask
i believ up toward the great harbour call delagoa bai where the
portugues rule my cousin hernan who accompani usand she shiver
a littl in my armsi half portugues he tell the boer that he
ha relat there who have written him mani fine promis sai thei
will give us good countri to dwell in where we cannot be follow by the
english whom he and my father hate so much
i have heard that is all fever veld and that the countri between is
full of fierc kaffir i said with a groan
perhap i do not know and i do not care at least that is the notion
in my father head though of cours circumst mai chang it
i will try to let you know allan or if i do not perhap you will be
abl to find out for yourself then then if we both live and you still
care for me who will alwai care for you when i am of ag you will
join us and sai and do what thei mai i will marri no other man and if
i die as mai well happen oh then my spirit shall watch over you and
wait for you till you join me beneath the wing of god look it grow
light i must go farewel my love my first and onli love till in
life or death we meet again as meet we shall
onc more we clung togeth and kiss mutter broken word and then
she tore herself from my embrac and wa gone but oh as i heard her
feet steal through the dewladen grass i felt as though my heart were
be rent from my breast i have suffer much in life but i do not
think that ever i underw a bitter anguish than in thi hour of my
part from mari for when all is said and done what joi is
there like the joi of pure first love and what bitter like the
bitter of it loss
half an hour later the flower tree of maraisfontein were behind us
while in front roll the fireswept veld black as life had becom for
me
chapter vii allan call
a fortnight later marai pereira and their companion a littl band
in all of about twenti men thirti women and children and sai fifti
halfbre and hottentot afterrid trek from their home into
the wilder i rode to the crest of a tabletop hill and watch
the long line of wagon on of them contain mari crawl awai
northward across the veld a mile or more beneath
sore wa i tempt to gallop after them and seek a last interview with
her and her father but my pride forbad me henri marai had given
out that if i came near hi daughter he would have me beaten back with
sjambock or hide whip perhap he had gain some inkl of our
last farewel in the peach orchard i do not know but i do know that if
anyon had lift a sjambock on me i should have answer with a bullet
then there would have been blood between us which is wors to cross
than whole river of wrath and jealousi so i just watch the wagon
until thei vanish and gallop home down the rockstrewn slope
wish that the hors would stumbl and break my neck
when i reach the station howev i wa glad that it had not done so
as i found my father sit on the stoep read a letter that had been
brought by a mount hottentot
it wa from henri marai and ran thu
reverend heer and friend quatermaini send thi to bid you farewel
for although you ar english and we have quarrel at time i honour
you in my heart friend now that we ar start your warn word
lie on me like lead i know not why but what is done cannot be undon
and i trust that all will come right if not it is becaus the good
lord will it otherwis
here my father look up and said when men suffer from their own
passion and folli thei alwai lai the blame on the back of provid
then he went on spell out the letter
i fear your boi allan who is a brave lad as i have reason to know
and honest must think that i have treat him harshli and without
gratitud but i have onli done what i must do true mari who like
her mother is veri strong and stubborn in mind swear that she will
marri no on els but soon natur will make her forget all that
especi as such a fine husband wait for her hand so bid allan
forget all about her also and when he is old enough choos some english
girl i have sworn a great oath befor my god that he shall never marri
my daughter with my consent
friend i write to ask you someth becaus i trust you more than
these slim agent half the price a veri poor on that i have for my
farm is still unpaid to me by jacobu van der merv who remain behind
and bui up all our land it is 100 english due thi dai year and i
enclos you power of attornei to receiv and give receipt for the same
also there is due to me from your british govern 253 on account
of slave liber which were worth quit 1000 thi also the paper
give you author to receiv as regard my claim against the said
curs govern becaus of the loss brought on me by the quabi
kaffir it will not acknowledg them sai that the attack wa caus
by the frenchman leblanc on of my household
and with good reason comment my father
when you have receiv these moni if ever i prai you take some
safe opportun of send them to me wherev i mai be which
doubtless you will hear in due cours although by that time i hope to
be rich again and not to need monei farewel and god be with you as
i hope he will be with me and mari and the rest of us trekboer the
bearer will overtak us with your answer at our first outspan
henri marai
well said my father with a sigh i suppos i must accept hi trust
though why he should choos an accurs englishman with whom he ha
quarrel violent to collect hi debt instead of on of hi own
belov boer i am sure i do not know i will go and write to him
allan see that the messeng and hi hors get someth to eat
i nod and went to the man who wa on of those that had defend
maraisfontein with me a good fellow unless he got near liquor
heer allan he said look round to see that we were not overheard
i have a littl write for you also and he produc from hi pouch a
note that wa unaddress
i tore it open eagerli within wa written in french which no boer
would understand if the letter fell into hi hand
be brave and faith and rememb as i shall oh love of my heart
adieu adieu
thi messag wa unsign but what need wa there of signatur
i wrote an answer of a sort that mai be imagin though what the exact
word were i cannot rememb after the laps of nearli half a centuri
oddli enough it is the thing i said which i recal at such a distanc
of time rather than the thing which i wrote perhap becaus when onc
written my mind be deliv troubl itself with them no more so
in due cours the hottentot depart with my father letter and my own
and that wa the last direct commun which we had with henri or
mari marai for more than a year
i think that those long month were on the whole the most wretch i
have ever spent the time of life which i wa pass through is alwai
try that period of emerg from youth into full and respons
manhood which in africa gener take place earlier than it doe
here in england where young men often seem to me to remain boi up
to fiveandtwenti the circumst which i have detail made it
particularli so in my own case for here wa i who should have been but
a cheer lad oppress with the sorrow and anxieti and fetter
by the affect of matur
i could not get mari out of my mind her imag wa with me by dai and
by night especi by night which caus me to sleep badli i becam
moros supersensit and excit i develop a cough and thought
as did other that i wa go into a declin i rememb that han
even ask me onc if i would not come and peg out the exact place where
i should like to be buri so that i might be sure that there would
be no mistak made when i could no longer speak for myself on that
occas i kick han on of the few upon which i have ever touch
a nativ the truth wa that i had not the slightest intent of be
buri i want to live and marri mari not to die and be put in
a hole by han onli i saw no prospect of marri mari or even of
see her again and that wa why i felt lowspirit
of cours from time to time new of the trekboer reach us but
it wa extrem confus there were so mani parti of them their
adventur were so difficult to follow and i mai add often so
terribl so few of them could write trustworthi messeng were
so scanti distanc were so great at ani rate we heard noth of
maraiss band except a rumour that thei had trek to a district in
what is now the transvaal which is call rustenberg and thenc on
toward delagoa bai into an unknown veld where thei had vanish from
mari herself no letter came which show me clearli enough that she
had not found an opportun of send on
observ my depress condit my father suggest as a remedi that i
should go to the theolog colleg at cape town and prepar myself
for ordin but the church as a career did not appeal to me perhap
becaus i felt that i could never be suffici good perhap becaus
i knew that as a clergyman i should find no opportun of travel
north when my call came for i alwai believ that thi call would
come
my father who wish that i should hear anoth kind of call wa vex
with me over thi matter he desir earnestli that i should follow the
profess which he adorn and inde saw no other open for me ani
more than i did myself of cours he wa right in a wai see that in
the end i found none unless big game hunt and kaffir trade can be
call a profess i dont know i am sure still poor busi as
it mai be i sai now when i am get toward the end of life that i
am glad i did not follow ani other it ha suit me that wa the
insignific hole in the world affair which i wa destin to fit
whose onli gift were a remark art of straight shoot and the more
common on of observ mix with a littl untrain philosophi
so hot did our argument becom about thi subject of the church for
as mai be imagin in the cours of them i reveal some unorthodoxi
especi as regard the matter of our method of christianis
kaffir that i wa extrem thank when a divers occur which
took me awai from home the stori of my defenc of maraisfontein had
spread far and that of my feat of shoot especi in the goos
kloof still farther so the end of it wa that those in author
command me to serv in on of the continu kaffir frontier war
which wa in progress and instantli gave me a commiss as a kind of
lieuten in a border corp
now the event of that particular war have noth to do with the
histori that i am tell so i do not propos even to touch on them
i serv in it for a year meet with mani adventur on or two
success and sever failur onc i wa wound slightli twice
i but just escap with my life onc i wa reprimand for take a
foolish risk and lose some men twice i wa commend for what were
call gallant action such as bring a wound comrad out of danger
under a warm fire mostli of assegai and penetr by night almost
alon into the stronghold of a chieftain and shoot him
at length that war wa patch up with an inconclus peac and my
corp wa disband i return home no longer a lad but a man with
experi of variou kind and a rather uniqu knowledg of kaffir
their languag histori and mode of thought and action also i had
associ a good deal with british offic and from them acquir
much that i had found no opportun of studi befor especi i
hope the idea and standard of english gentlemen
i had not been back at the mission station more than three week quit
long enough for me to begin to be bore with idl and inact
when that call for which i had been wait came at last
on dai a smou that is a low kind of white man often a jew who
travel about trade with unsophist boer and kaffir and
cheat them if he can call at the station with hi cart of
good i wa about to send him awai have no like for such gentri
when he ask me if i were name allan quatermain i said ye whereon
he repli that he had a letter for me and produc a packet wrap up
in sailcloth i ask him whenc he had it and he answer from a man
whom he had met at port elizabeth an east coast trader who hear
that he wa come into the cradock district entrust him with the
letter the man told him that it wa veri import and that i should
reward the bearer well if it were deliv safe
while the jew talk i think he wa a jew i wa open the
sailcloth within wa a piec of linen which had been oil to keep out
water address in some red pigment to myself or my father thi too
i open not without difficulti for it wa carefulli sewn up and
found within it a letterpacket also address to myself or my father
in the handwrit of mari
great heaven how my heart jump at that sight call to han to make
the smou comfort and give him food i went into my own room and
there read the letter which ran thu
my dear allani do not know whether the other letter i have written
to you have ever come to your hand or inde if thi on will still
i send it on chanc by a wander portugues halfbre who is go
to delagoa bai about fifti mile i believ from the place where i now
write near the crocodil river my father ha name it maraisfontein
after our old home if those letter reach you you will have learn
of the terribl thing we went through on our journei the attack by
the kaffir in the zoutpansberg region who destroi on of our parti
altogeth and so forth if not all that stori must wait for it is
too long to tell now and inde i have but littl paper and not
much pencil it will be enough to sai therefor that to the number
of thirtyf white peopl men women and children we trek at the
begin of the summer season when the grass wa commenc to grow
from the lydenburg districtan aw journei over mountain and through
flood river after mani delai some of them month long we reach
thi place about eight week ago for i write to you at the begin
of june if we have kept correct account of the time of which i am not
certain
it is a beauti place to look at a flat countri of rich veld with
big tree grow on it and about two mile from the great river that
is call the crocodil here find good water my father and hernan
pereira who now rule him in all thing determin to settl although
some of the other wish to push on nearer to delagoa bai there wa a
great quarrel about it but in the end my father or rather hernan had
hi will as the oxen were worn out and mani had alreadi di from the
bite of a poison fly which is call the tsets so we lot out
the land of which there is enough for hundr and began to build rude
hous
then troubl came upon us the kaffir stole most of our hors
although thei have not dare to attack us and except two belong to
hernan the rest di of the sick the last of them but yesterdai
the oxen too have all di of the tsets bite or other ill but
the worst is that although thi countri look so healthi it is poison
with fever which come up i think in the mist from the river
alreadi out of the thirtyf of us ten ar dead two men three
women and five children while more ar sick as yet my father and
i and my cousin pereira have by god merci kept quit well but
although we ar all veri strong how long thi will continu i cannot
tell fortun we have plenti of ammunit and the place is thick
with game so that those of the men who remain strong can kill all the
food we want even shoot on foot and we women have made a great
quantiti of biltong by salt flesh and dry it in the sun so we
shall not actual starv for a long while even if the game goe awai
but dear allan unless help come to us i think that we shall die
everi on for god alon know the miseri that we suffer and the
horribl sight of sick and death that ar around us at thi moment
there li by me a littl girl who is dy of fever
oh allan if you can help us do so becaus of our sick it is
imposs for us to get to delagoa bai and if we did we have no monei
to bui anyth there for all that we had with us wa lost in a wagon
in a flood river it wa a great sum for it includ hernan rich
fortun which he brought from the cape with him in gold nor can we move
anywher els for we have no cattl or hors we have sent to delagoa
bai where we hear these ar to be had to try to bui them on credit
but my cousin hernan relat of whom he us to talk so much
ar dead or gone awai and no on will trust us with the neighbour
kaffir too who have plenti of cattl we have quarrel sinc
unfortun my cousin and some of the other boer tri to take
certain beast of their without payment so we ar quit helpless and
can onli wait for death
allan my father sai that he ask your father to collect some moni
that were ow to him if it were possibl for you or other friend to
come to delagoa in a ship with that monei i think that it might serv
to bui some oxen enough for a few wagon then perhap we might trek
back and fall in with a parti of boer who we believ have cross the
quathlamba mountain into natal or perhap we might get to the bai and
find a ship to take us anywher from thi horribl place if you could
come the nativ would guid you to where we ar
but it is too much to hope that you will come or that if you do come
you will find us still aliv
allan my dearest i have on more thing to sai though i must sai it
shortli for the paper is nearli finish i do not know suppos that
you ar aliv and well whether you still care for me who left you so
long agoit seem year and yearsbut my heart is where it wa and
where i promis it should remain in your keep of cours hernan

oh why did god ever put it into my father heart to leav the cape
coloni just becaus he hate the british govern and hernan pereira

your mari
such wa thi aw letter i still have it it li befor me those
rag sheet of paper cover with faint pencilwrit that is blot
here and there with tear mark some of them the tear of mari who
wrote some of them the tear of me who read i wonder if there exist a
more piteou memori of the terribl suffer of the trekboer and
especi of such of them as forc their wai into the poison
veld around delagoa as did thi marai expedit and those under
the command of triechard better like mani of their peopl to have
perish at onc by the spear of umzilikazi and other savag than to
endur these linger tortur of fever and starvat
as i finish read thi letter my father who had been out visit
some of hi mission kaffir enter the hous and i went into the
sittingroom to meet him
why allan what is the matter with you he ask note my
tearstain face
i gave him the letter for i could not speak and with difficulti he
deciph it
merci god what dread new he said when he had finish those
poor peopl those poor misguid peopl what can be done for them
i know on thing that can be done father or at ani rate can be
attempt i can try to reach them
ar you mad he ask how is it possibl for you on man to get to
delagoa bai bui cattl and rescu these folk who probabl ar now all
dead
the first two thing ar possibl enough father some ship will take
me to the bai you have maraiss monei and i have that five hundr
pound which my old aunt in england left me last year thank heaven
ow to my absenc on commando it still li untouch in the bank at
port elizabeth that is about eight hundr pound in all which would
bui a great mani cattl and other thing as for the third it is not in
our hand is it it mai be that thei cannot be rescu it mai be that
thei ar dead i can onli go to see
but allan allan you ar my onli son and if you go it is probabl
that i shall never see you more
i have been through more danger late father and am still aliv
and well moreov if mari is deadi paus then went on
passionatelydo not try to stop me for i tell you father i will not
be stop think of the word in that letter and what a shameless hound
i should be if i sat here quiet while mari is dy yonder would you
have done so if mari had been my mother
no answer the old gentleman i should not go and god be with
you allan and me also for i never expect to see you again and he
turn hi head asid for a while
then we went into matter the smou wa summon and ask about the
ship which brought the letter from delagoa it seem that she wa an
englishown brig known as the seven star and that her captain on
richardson propos to sail back to the bai on the morrow that wa the
third of juli or in other word within twentyfour hour
twentyfour hour and port elizabeth wa on hundr and eighteen mile
awai and the seven star might leav earlier if she had complet her
cargo and wind and weather serv moreov if she did leav it might
be week or month befor ani other ship sail for delagoa bai for in
those dai of cours there were no mail boat
i look at my watch it wa four oclock in the afternoon and from a
calendar we had which gave the tide at port elizabeth and other south
african harbour it did not seem probabl that the seven star would
sail if she kept to her date befor about eight on the morrow on
hundr and twenti mile to be cover in sai fourteen hour over
rough countri with some hill well on the other hand the road were
fairli good and dry with no flood river to cross although
there might be on to swim and there wa a full moon it could be
donebar and now i wa glad inde that hernan pereira had not won
my swift mare in that shoot match
i call to han who wa loaf about outsid and said quietli
i ride to port elizabeth and must be there by eight oclock tomorrow
morn
allemacht exclaim han who had been that road sever time
you will go with me and from port elizabeth on to delagoa bai saddl
the mare and the roan hors and put a headstal on the chestnut to lead
with you as a spare give them all a feed but no water we start in
half an hour then i ad certain direct as to the gun we would
take saddlebag cloth blanket and other detail and bade him
start about the busi
han never hesit he had been with me through my recent campaign
and wa accustom to sudden order moreov i think that if i had
told him i wa ride to the moon beyond hi customari exclam
of allemacht he would have made no object to accompani me
thither
the next halfhour wa a busi time for me henri maraiss monei had to
be got out of the strong box and arrang in a belt of buck hide that
i had strap about me a letter had to be written by my father to the
manag of the port elizabeth bank identifi me as the owner of the
sum lodg there in my name a meal must be eaten and some food prepar
for us to carri the hors shoe had to be seen to and a few cloth
pack in the saddlebag also there were other thing which i have
forgotten yet within fiveandthirti minut the long lean mare stood
befor the door behind her with a tall crane feather in hi hat
wa han mount on the roan stallion and lead the chestnut a
fouryearold which i had bought as a foal on the mare as part of
the bargain have been corn fed from a colt it wa a veri sound and
wellgrown hors though not the equal of it mother in speed
in the passag my poor old father who wa quit bewild by the
rapid and urgent natur of thi busi embrac me
god bless you my dear boi he said i have had littl time to think
but i prai that thi mai be all for the best and that we mai meet again
in the world but if not rememb what i have taught you and if i
surviv you for my part i shall rememb that you di try to
do your duti oh what troubl ha the blind mad of henri marai
brought upon us all well i warn him that it would be so goodby
my dear boi goodby my prayer will follow you and for the
restwel i am old and what doe it matter if my grei hair come with
sorrow to the grave
i kiss him back and with an ach heart sprang to the saddl in
five more minut the station wa out of sight
thirteen and a half hour later i pull rein upon the quai of port
elizabeth just onli just in time to catch captain richardson as he wa
enter hi boat to row out to the seven star on which the canva
wa alreadi be hoist as well as i could in my exhaust state i
explain matter and persuad him to wait till the next tide then
thank god for the mare speedth roan had been left founder
thirti mile awai and han wa follow on the chestnut but not yet
upi drag the poor beast to an inn at hand there she lai down and
di well she had done her work and there wa no other hors in the
countri that could have caught that boat
an hour or so later han came in flog the chestnut and here i mai
add that both it and the roan recov inde i rode them for mani
year until thei were quit old when i had eaten or tri to eat
someth and rest awhil i went to the bank succeed in explain
the state of the case to the manag and after some difficulti for
gold wa not veri plenti in port elizabeth procur three hundr
pound in sovereign for the other two he gave me a bill upon some
agent in delagoa bai togeth with a letter of recommend to him
and the portugues governor who it appear wa in debt to their
establish by an afterthought howev although i kept the letter
i return him the bill and spent the 200 in purchas a great varieti
of good which i will not enumer that i knew would be us for
trade purpos among the east coast kaffir inde i practic
clear out the port elizabeth store and bare had time with the
help of han and the storekeep to pack and ship the good befor the
seven star put out to sea
within twentyfour hour from the time i had left the mission station
han and i saw behind us port elizabeth fade into the distanc and in
front a wast of stormi water
chapter viii the camp of death
everyth went well upon that voyag except with me person not
have been on the ocean sinc i wa a child i who am natur no
good sailor wa extrem ill as dai by dai we plough through sea
that grew ever more rough also strong as i wa that fear ride
had overdon me ad to these physic discomfort wa my agonis
anxieti of mind which i leav anyon with imagin to pictur for
himself realli there were time when i wish that the seven star
would plung headlong to the bottom of the deep and put an end to me and
my miseri
these howev so far as the bodili side of them wa concern were i
think surpass by those of my henchman han who as a matter of
fact had never befor set foot in ani kind of boat perhap thi wa
fortun sinc had he known the horror of the ocean much as he love
me he would i am sure by on mean or anoth have left me to voyag
in the seven star alon there he lai upon the floor of my littl
cabin roll to and fro with the violent motion of the brig overcom
with terror he wa convinc that we were go to be drown and in
the interv of furiou seasick utter piteou lament in
dutch english and variou nativ tongu mingl with curs and
prayer of the most primit and realist order
after the first twentyfour hour or so he inform me with mani moan
that the last bit of hi insid had just come out of him and that he
wa now quit hollow like a gourd also he declar that all these
evil had fallen upon him becaus he had been fool enough to forsak the
religion of hi peopl what wa that i wonder and allow himself to
be wash white that is be baptis by my father
i answer that as he had becom white instead of stai yellow i
advis him to remain so sinc it wa evid that the hottentot god
would have noth more to do with on who had desert them thereon he
made a dread face which even in the midst of my own woe caus me
to laugh at him utter a prolong groan and becam so silent that
i thought he must be dead howev the sailor who brought me my
foodsuch foodassur me that thi wa not so and lash him tight
to the leg of the bunk by hi arm and ankl so as to prevent him from
be roll to bit
next morn han wa dose with brandi which in hi empti condit
made him extrem drunk and from that time forward began to take a
more cheer view of thing especi wa thi so when the hour
for the brandi medicin came round han like most other hottentot
love spirit and would put up with much to get them even with my
father fieri indign
i think it wa on the fourth dai that at length we pitch and roll
ourselv over the shallow bar of port natal and found ourselv at
peac for a while under shelter of the point in the beauti bai upon
the shore of which the town of durban now stand then it wa but a
miser place consist of a few shanti which were afterward
burnt by the zulu and a number of kaffir hut for such white men as
dwelt there had for the most part nativ follow and i mai add
nativ wive
we spent two dai at thi settlement of durban where captain richardson
had some cargo to land for the english settler on or two of whom had
start a trade with the nativ and with parti of the emigr boer
who were begin to enter the territori by the overland rout those
dai i pass on shore though i would not allow han to accompani
me lest he should desert emploi my time in pick up all the
inform i could about the state of affair especi with
refer to the zulu a peopl with whom i wa destin er long to
make an intim acquaint needless to sai i inquir both from
nativ and from white men whether anyth wa known of the fate of
maraiss parti but no on seem even to have heard of them on thing
i did learn howev that my old friend pieter retief with a larg
follow had cross the quathlamba mountain which we now know as
the drakensberg and enter the territori of natal here thei propos
to settl if thei could get the leav of the zulu king dingaan a
savag potent of whom and of whose armi everyon seem to live in
terror
on the third morn to my great relief for i wa terrifi lest we
should be delai the seven star sail with a favour wind three
dai later we enter the harbour of delagoa a sheet of water mani
mile long and broad notwithstand it shallow entranc it is the
best natur port in southeastern africa but now ala lost to the
english
six hour later we anchor opposit a sandbank on which stood a
dilapid fort and a dirti settlement known as lorenzo marquez where
the portugues kept a few soldier most of them colour i pass over
my troubl with the custom if such thei could be call suffic it
to sai that ultim i succeed in land my good on which the
duti chargeabl wa appar enorm thi i did by distribut
twentyf english sovereign among variou offici begin with
the actinggovernor and end with a drunken black sweep who sat in a
kind of sentri box on the quai
earli next morn the seven star sail again becaus of some quarrel
with the offici who threaten to seiz heri forget why her
destin wa the east african port and i think madagascar where
a profit trade wa to be done in carri cattl and slave captain
richardson said he might be back at lorenzo marquez in two or
three month time or he might not as a matter of fact the latter
supposit prove correct for the seven star wa lost on a sandbank
somewher up the coast her crew onli escap to mombasa after endur
great hardship
well she had serv my turn for i heard afterward that no other ship
put into the bai for a whole year from the date she left it so if i had
not caught her at port elizabeth i could not have come at all except
of cours overland thi at best must have taken mani month and wa
moreov a journei that no man could enter on alon
now i get back to my stori again
there wa no inn at lorenzo marquez through the kind of on of hi
nativ or halfbre wive who could talk a littl dutch i manag
howev to get a lodg in a tumbledown hous belong to a
dissolut person who call himself don jo ximen but who wa realli
himself a halfbre here good fortun befriend me don jo when
sober wa a trader with the nativ and a year befor had acquir
from them two good buck wagon probabl thei were stolen from some
wander boer or found derelict after their murder or death by fever
these wagon he wa onli too glad to sell for a song i think i gave him
twenti pound english for the two and thirti more for twelv oxen that
he had bought at the same time as the wagon thei were fine beast of
the afrikand breed that after a long rest had grown quit fat and
strong
of cours twelv oxen were not enough to draw two wagon or even on
therefor hear that there were nativ on the mainland who possess
plenti of cattl i at onc gave out that i wa readi to bui and pai
well in blanket cloth bead and so forth the result wa that within
two dai i had forti or fifti to choos from small anim of the zulu
charact and i should add unbroken still thei were sturdi and us
to that veld and it diseas here it wa that my twelv train beast
came in by put six of them to each wagon two as fore and two as
afteroxen and two in the middl han and i were abl to get the other
ten necessari to make up a team of sixteen under some sort of control
heaven how we work dure the week or so which went by befor it
wa possibl for me to leav lorenzo marquez what with mend up and
load the wagon bui and break in the wild oxen purchas
provis hire nativ servantsof whom i wa lucki enough to secur
eight who belong to on of the zulu tribe and desir to get back to
their own countri whenc thei had wander with some boer i do not
think that we slept more than two or three hour out of the twentyfour
but it mai be ask what wa my aim whither went i what inquiri
had i made to answer the last question first i had made everi possibl
inquiri but with littl or no result mari letter had said that thei
were encamp on the bank of the crocodil river about fifti mile from
delagoa bai i ask everyon i met among the portuguesewho after
all were not manyif thei had heard of such an encamp of emigr
boer but these portugues appear to have heard noth except my
host don jo who had a vagu recollect of somethingh could not
rememb what
the fact wa at thi time the few peopl who live at lorenzo marquez
were too sodden with liquor and other vice to take ani interest in
outsid new that did not immedi concern them moreov the
nativ whom thei flog and oppress if thei were their servant or
fought with if thei were not told them littl and almost noth
that wa true for between the two race there wa an hereditari hate
stretch back for gener so from the portugues i gain no
inform
then i turn to the kaffir especi to those from whom i had bought
the cattl thei had heard that some boer reach the bank of the
crocodil moon agohow mani thei could not tell but that countri
thei said wa under the rule of a chief who wa hostil to them and
kill ani of their peopl who ventur thither therefor thei knew
noth for certain still on of them state that a woman whom he had
bought as a slave and who had pass through the district in question
a few week befor told him that someon had told her that these boer
were all dead of sick she ad that she had seen their wagon cap
from a distanc so if thei were dead their wagon were still aliv
i ask to see thi woman but the nativ refus to produc her after
a great deal of talk howev he offer to sell her to me sai that
he wa tire of her so i bargain with the man and final agre for
her purchas for three pound of copper wire and eight yard of blue
cloth next morn she wa produc an extrem ugli person with a
larg flat nose who came from somewher in the interior of africa
have i gather been taken captiv by arab and sold from hand to
hand her name as near as i can pronounc it wa jeel
i had great difficulti in establish commun with her but
ultim found that on of my newli hire kaffir could understand
someth of her languag even then it wa hard to make her talk for
she had never seen a white man and thought i had bought her for some
dread purpos or other howev when she found that she wa kindli
treat she open her lip and told me the same stori that her late
master had repeat neither more nor less final i ask her whether
she could guid me to the place where she had seen the live wagon
she answer oh ye as she had travel mani road and never
forgot ani of them
thi of cours wa all i want from the woman who i mai add
ultim gave me a good deal of troubl the poor creatur seem
never to have experienc kind and her gratitud for the littl
i show her wa so intens that it becam a nuisanc she follow me
about everywher try to do me servic in her savag wai and even
attempt to seiz my food and chew it befor i put it into my own
mouthto save me the troubl i suppos ultim i marri her
somewhat against her will i fear to on of the hire kaffir who made
her a veri good husband although when he wa dismiss from my servic
she want to leav him and follow me
at length under the guidanc of thi woman jeel we made a start
there were but fifti mile to go a distanc that on a fair road ani
good hors would cover in eight hour or less but we had no hors
and there wa no roadnoth but swamp and bush and rocki hill with
our untrain cattl it took us three dai to travel the first twelv
mile though after that thing went somewhat better
it mai be ask why did i not send on but whom could i send when no
on knew the wai except the woman jeel whom i fear to part with
lest i should see her no more moreov what wa the us of send
sinc the messeng could take no help if everyon at the camp wa
dead as rumour told uswel thei were dead and if thei live the
hope wa that thei might live a littl longer meanwhil i dare not
part with my guid nor dare i leav the relief wagon to go on with
her alon if i did so i knew that i should never see them again sinc
onli the prestig of their be own by a white man who wa not a
portugues prevent the nativ from loot them
it wa a truli aw journei my first idea had been to follow the bank
of the crocodil river which is what i should have attempt had i not
chanc on the woman jeel lucki wa it that i did not do so sinc i
found afterward that thi river wound about a great deal and wa join
by impass tributari also it wa border by forest jeel
track on the contrari follow an old slave road that bad as it wa
avoid the swampi place of the surround countri and those nativ
tribe which the experi of gener of the trader in thi
iniquit traffic show to be most danger
nine dai of fear struggl had gone by we had camp on night below
the crest of a long slope strewn with great rock mani of which we were
oblig to roll out of the path by main forc in order to make a wai for
the wagon the oxen had to lie in their yoke all night sinc we
dare not let them loos fear lest thei should strai also lion were
roar in the distanc although game be plenti these did not
come near to us as soon as there wa ani light we let out the team
to fill themselv on the tussocki grass that grew about and meanwhil
cook and at some food
present the sun rose and i saw that beneath us wa a great stretch of
plain cover with mist and to the north on our right sever denser
billow of mist that mark the cours of the crocodil river
by degre thi mist lift tall top of tree appear abov it till
at length it thin into vapour that vanish awai as the sun rose
as i watch it idli the woman jeel crept up to me in her furtiv
fashion touch me on the shoulder and point to a distant group of
tree
look close at these tree i saw between them what at first i
took for some white rock further examin as the mist clear
suggest to my mind howev that thei might be wagon tilt just then
the zulu who understood jeel talk came up i ask him as well as i
could for at that time my knowledg of hi tongu wa veri imperfect
what she wish to sai he question her and answer that she desir
to tell me that those were the move hous of the amaboona the boer
peopl just where she had seen them nearli two moon ago
at thi tide my heart seem to stand still so that for more than
a minut i could not speak there were the wagon at last butoh who
and what should i find in them i call han and bade him inspan as
quickli as possibl explain to him that yonder wa maraiss camp
why not let the oxen fill themselv first baa he answer there
is no hurri for though the wagon ar there no doubt all the peopl
ar dead long ago
do what i bid you you illomen beast i said instead of croak
of death like a crow and listen i am go to walk forward to that
camp you must follow with the wagon as fast as thei can travel
no baa it is not safe that you should go alon kaffir or wild
beast might take you
safe or not i am go but if you think it wise tell two of those
zulu to come with me
a few minut later i wa on the road follow by the two kaffir arm
with spear in my youth i wa a good runner be strong of leg and
light in bodi but i do not think that i ever cover seven mile for
that wa about the distanc to the camp in quicker time than i did that
morn inde i left those activ kaffir so far behind that when i
approach the tree thei were not in sight here i drop to a walk
as i said to myselfto get my breath realli it wa becaus i felt so
terrifi at what i might find that i delai the discoveri just for on
minut more while i approach hope howev faint still remain
when i arriv hope might be replac by everlast despair
now i could see that there were some shanti built behind the wagon
doubtless those rude hous of which mari had written but i could
not see anyon move about them or ani cattl or ani smoke or other
sign of life nor could i hear a singl sound
doubtless thought i to myself han is right thei ar all long dead
my agoni of suspens wa replac by an ici calm at length i knew the
worst it wa finishedi had striven in vain i walk through the
outli tree and between two of the wagon on of these i notic
as we do notic thing at such time wa the same in which marai had
trek with hi daughter hi favourit wagon that onc i had help to
fit with a new disselboom
befor me were the rough hous built of the branch of tree daub
over with mud or rather the back of them for thei face west i stood
still for a moment and as i stood thought that i heard a faint sound as
of someon recit slowli i crept along the end of the outermost hous
and rub the cold sweat from my ey peep round the corner for
it occur to me that savag might be in possess then i saw what
caus the sound a tatter blacken beard man stood at the head
of a long and shallow hole sai a prayer
it wa henri marai although at the time i did not recognis him so
chang wa he a number of littl mound to the right and left of him
told me howev that the hole wa a grave as i watch two more men
appear drag between them the bodi of a woman which evid
thei had not strength to carri as it leg trail upon the ground
from the shape of the corps it seem to be that of a tall young woman
but the featur i could not see becaus it wa be drag face
downward also the long hair hang from the head hid them it wa
dark hair like mari thei reach the grave and tumbl their sad
burden into it but ii could not stir
at length my limb obei my will i went forward to the men and said in
a hollow voic in dutch
whom do you buri
johanna meyer answer someon mechan for thei did not seem
to have taken the troubl to look at me as i listen to those word my
heart which had stood still wait for the answer beat again with a
sudden bound that i could hear in the silenc
i look up there advanc from the doorwai of on of the hous
veri slowli as though overpow by weak and lead by the hand
a mere skeleton of a child who wa chew some leav i sawi saw
mari marai she wa wast to noth but i could not mistak her
ey those great soft ey that had grown so unnatur larg in the
white thin face
she too saw me and stare for on moment then loos the child
she cast up her hand through which the sunlight shone as through
parchment and slowli sank to the ground
she ha gone too said on of the men in an indiffer voic i
thought she would not last anoth dai
now for the first time the man at the head of the grave turn lift
hi hand he point to me whereon the other two men turn also
god abov us he said in a choke voic at last i am quit mad
look there stand the spook of young allan the son of the english
prdicant who live near cradock
as soon as i heard the voic i knew the speaker
oh mynheer marai i cri i am no ghost i am allan himself come
to save you
marai made no answer he seem bewild but on of the men cri
out crazili
how can you save us youngster unless you ar readi to be eaten dont
you see we starv we starv
i have wagon and food i answer
allemacht henri exclaim the man with a wild laugh do you hear
what your english spook sai he sai that he ha wagon and food

then marai burst into tear and flung himself upon my breast nearli
knock me down i wrench myself free of him and ran to mari who
wa ly face upward on the ground she seem to hear my step for
her ey open and she struggl to a sit postur
is it realli you allan or do i dream she murmur
it is i it is i i answer lift her to her feet for she seem
to weigh no more than a child her head fell upon my shoulder and she
too began to weep
still hold her i turn to the men and said
why do you starv when there is game all about and i point to two
fat eland stroll among the tree not more than a hundr and fifti
yard awai
can we kill game with stone ask on of them we whose powder wa
all burnt a month ago those buck he ad with a wild laugh come
here to mock us everi morn but thei will not walk into our pitfal
thei know them too well and we have no strength to dig other
now when i left my wagon i had brought with me that same purdei rifl
with which i had shot the gees in the match against pereira choos
it becaus it wa so light to carri i held up my hand for silenc
set mari gentli on the ground and began to steal toward the eland
take what shelter i could i got within a hundr yard of them when
suddenli thei took alarm be frighten in fact by my two zulu
servant who were now arriv
off thei gallop the big bull lead and vanish behind some tree
i saw their line and that thei would appear again between two clump of
bush about two hundr and fifti yard awai hastili i rais the full
sight on the rifl which wa mark for two hundr yard lift it
and wait prai to god as i did so that my skill might not fail me
the bull appear it head held forward it long horn ly flat upon
the back the shot wa veri long and the beast veri larg to bring down
with so small a bullet i aim right forwardclear of it indeedhigh
too in a line with it backbon and press the trigger
the rifl explod the bullet clap and the buck sprang forward
faster than ever i had fail but what wa thi suddenli the great
bull swung round and began to gallop toward us when it wa not more
than fifti yard awai it fell in a heap roll twice over like a shot
rabbit and lai still that bullet wa in it heart
the two kaffir appear breathless and stream with perspir
cut meat from the eland flank dont stop to skin it i said in my
broken zulu help the word out with sign
thei understood and a minut later were at work with their assegai
then i look about me near by lai a store of dead branch place
there for fuel
have you fire i ask of the skeleton boer for thei were noth
more
nein nein thei answer our fire is dead
i produc the tinderbox which i carri with me and struck the flint
ten minut later we had a cheer blaze and within threequart of
an hour good soup for iron pot were not wantingonli food to put into
them i think that for the rest of that dai those poor creatur did
littl els but eat sleep between their meal oh the joi i had in
feed them especi after the wagon arriv bring with them
salthow thei long for that saltsugar and coffe
chapter ix the promis
of the origin thirtyf soul not reckon nativ who had
accompani henri marai upon hi illfat expedit there now
remain but nine aliv at the new maraisfontein these were
himself hi daughter four prinsloosa famili of extraordinari
constitutionand three meyer be the husband of the poor woman i
had seen commit to the grave and two of her six children the rest
hernan pereira except had di of fever and actual starvat for
when the fever lessen with the chang of the season the starvat
set in it appear that with the except of a veri littl thei had
store their powder in a kind of outbuild which thei construct
place it at a distanc for safeti sake when most of the surviv
men were awai howev a grass fire set light to thi outbuild and
all the powder blew up
after thi for a while thei suppli the camp with food by the help of
such ammunit as remain to them when that fail thei dug pit in
which to catch game in time the buck came to know of these pit so
that thei snare no more
then as the biltong or sundri meat thei had made wa all consum
thei were driven to everi desper expedi that is known to the
starv such as the dig up of bulb the boil of grass twig
and leav the catch of lizard and so forth i believ that thei
actual at caterpillar and earthworm but after their last fire went
out through the neglect of the wretch kaffir who wa left to watch it
and have no tinder thei fail to relight it by friction of cours
even thi food fail them when i arriv thei had practic been
three dai without anyth to eat except green leav and grass such
as i saw the child chew in anoth seventi hour doubtless everi on
of them would have been dead
well thei recov rapidli enough for those who had surviv it
ravag were evid now impervi to fever who can tell the joi
that i experienc as i watch mari return from the veri brink of
the grave to a state of full and love womanhood after all we were
not so far awai from the primit condit of human when the
first duti of man wa to feed hi women and hi children and i think
that someth of that instinct remain with us at least i know i
never experienc a greater pleasur than i did when the woman i love
the poor starv woman at and at of the food which i wa abl to
give hersh who for week had exist upon locust and herb
for the first few dai we did not talk much except of the immedi
necess of the hour which occupi all our thought afterward
when marai and hi daughter were strong enough to bear it we had some
convers he began by ask how i came to find them
i repli through mari letter which it appear he knew noth
of for he had forbidden her to write to me
it seem fortun that you were disobei mynheer i said to which
he answer noth
then i told the tale of the arriv of that letter at the mission
station in the cape coloni by the hand of a wander smou and of
my desper ride upon the swift mare to port elizabeth where i just
succeed in catch the brig seven star befor she sail also i
told them of the lucki chanc that enabl me to bui the wagon and
find a guid to their camp reach it but a few hour befor it wa
too late
it wa a great deed said henri marai take the pipe from hi
mouth for i had brought tobacco among my store but tell me allan
why did you do it for the sake of on who ha not treat you kindli
i did it i answer for the sake of on who ha alwai treat me
kindli and i nod toward mari who wa engag in wash up the
cook pot at a distanc
i suppos so allan but you know she is affianc to anoth
i know that she is affianc to me and to no other i answer
warmli ad and prai where is thi other if he live i do not see
him here
no repli marai in a curiou voic the truth is allan that
hernan pereira left us about a fortnight befor you came on hors
remain which wa hi and with two hottentot who were also hi
servant he rode back upon the track by which we came to try to find
help sinc then we have heard noth of him
inde and how did he propos to get food on the wai
he had a rifl or rather thei all three had rifl and about a
hundr charg between them which escap the fire
with a hundr charg of powder carefulli us your camp would have
been fed for a month or perhap two month i remark yet he went
awai with all of themto find help
that is so allan we beg him to stai but he would not and after
all the charg were hi own properti no doubt he thought he act for
the best especi as mari would have none of him marai ad with
emphasi
well i repli it seem that it is i who have brought you the help
and not pereira also by the wai mynheer i have brought you the monei
my father collect on your account and some 500 of my own or what is
left of it in good and gold moreov mari doe not refus me sai
therefor to which of us doe she belong
it would seem that it should be to you he answer slowli sinc you
have shown yourself so faith and were it not for you she would now
be ly yonder and he point to the littl heap that cover the
bone of most of the expedit ye ye it would seem that it should
be to you who twice have save her life and onc have save mine also
now i suppos that he saw on my face the joi which i could not conceal
for he ad hastili yet allan year ago i swore on the book befor
god that never with my will should my daughter marri an englishman even
if he were a good englishman also just befor we left the coloni i
swore again in her presenc and that of hernan pereira that i would
not give her to you so i cannot break my oath can i if i did the
good god would be aveng upon me
some might think that when i came here the good god wa in the wai of
be aveng upon you for the keep of that evil oath i answer
bitterli glanc in my turn at the grave
ye thei might allan he repli without anger for all hi troubl
had induc a reason frame of mind in himfor a while yet hi
wai ar past find out ar thei not
now my anger broke out and rise i said
do you mean mynheer marai that notwithstand the love between us
which you know is true and deep and notwithstand that i alon have
been abl to drag both of you and the other out of the claw of death
i am never to marri mari do you mean that she is to be given to a
braggart who desert her in her need
and what if i do mean that allan
thi although i am still young as you know well i am a man who can
think and act for himself also i am your master herei have cattl
and gun and servant well i will take mari and if ani should try to
stop me i know how to protect myself and her
thi bold speech did not seem to surpris him in the least or to make
him think the wors of me he look at me for a while pull hi long
beard in a medit fashion then answer
i dare sai that at your ag i should have plai the same game and
it is true that you have thing in your fist but much as she mai love
you mari would not go awai with you and leav her father to starv
then you can come with us as my fatherinlaw mynheer marai at
ani rate it is certain that i will not go awai and leav her here to
starv
now i think that someth which he saw in my ey show him that i wa
in earnest at least he chang hi tone and began to argu almost to
plead
be reason allan he said how can you marri mari when there is
no prdicant to marri you sure if you love her so much you would
not pour mud upon her name even in thi wilder
she might not think it mud i repli men and women have been
marri without the help of priest befor now by open declar
and public report for instanc and their children held to be born in
wedlock i know that for i have read of the law of marriag
it mai be allan though i hold no marriag good unless the holi word
ar said but why do you not let me come to the end of my stori
becaus i thought it wa end mynheer marai
not so allan i told you that i had sworn that she should never marri
you with my will but when she is of ag which will be in some six
month time my will count no longer see that then she is a free
woman who can dispos of herself also i shall be clear of my oath for
no harm will come to my soul if that happen which i cannot help now
ar you satisfi
i dont know i answer doubtfulli for somehow all maraiss
casuistri which i thought contempt did not convinc me that he wa
sincer i dont know i repeat much mai chanc in six month
of cours allan for instanc mari might chang her mind and marri
someon els
or i might not be there to marri mynheer accid sometim happen
to men who ar not want especi in wild countri or for the
matter of that to those who ar
allemacht allan you do not mean that i
no mynheer i interrupt but there ar other peopl in the world
besid yourselfhernan pereira for exampl if he live still i am
not the onli on concern in thi matter there is mari yonder shall
i call her
he nod prefer probabl that i should speak to her in hi
presenc rather than alon
so i call mari who wa watch our talk somewhat anxious while
she went about her task she came at onc a veri differ mari to
the starv girl of a while befor for although she wa still thin
and drawn her youth and beauti were return to her fast under the
influenc of good food and happi
what is it allan she ask gentli i told her all repeat our
convers and the argument which had been us on either side word
for word as nearli as i could rememb them
is that right i ask of marai when i had finish
it is right you have a good memori he answer
veri well and now what have you to sai mari
i dear allan why thi my life belong to you who have twice save
thi bodi of mine from death as my love and spirit belong to you
therefor i should have thought it no shame if i had been given to you
here and now befor the peopl and afterward marri by a clergyman
when we found on but my father ha sworn an oath which weigh upon
hi mind and he ha shown you that within six monthsa short six
monthsthat oath di of itself sinc by the law he can no longer
control me so allan as i would not griev him or perhap lead him to
sai and do what is foolish i think it would be well that we should wait
for those six month if on hi part he promis that he will then do
noth to prevent our marriag
ja ja i promis that then i will do noth to prevent your
marriag answer marai eagerli like on who ha suddenli seen some
loophol of escap from an imposs posit ad as though to
himself but god mai do someth to prevent it for all that
we ar everi on of us in the hand of god she repli in her sweet
voic allan you hear my father ha promis
ye mari he ha promisedaft a fashion i repli gloomili for
somehow hi word struck a chill through me
i have promis allan and i will keep my promis to you as i have
kept my oath to god attempt to work you no harm and leav all in
hi hand but you on your part must promis also that till she is of
ag you will not take mari as a wifeno not if you were left alon
togeth in the veld you must be as peopl who ar affianc to each
other no more
so have no choic i promis though with a heavi heart then i
suppos in order to make thi solemn contract public marai call the
surviv boer who were loiter near and repeat to them the term
of the contract that we had made
the men laugh and shrug their shoulder but vrouw prinsloo i
rememb said outright that she thought the busi foolish sinc if
anyon had a right to mari i had wherev i chose to take her she
ad that as for hernan pereira he wa a sneak and a stinkcat who
had gone off to save hi own life and left them all to die if she
were mari should thei meet again she would greet him with a pail
of dirti water in the face as she herself meant to do if she got the
chanc
vrouw prinsloo it will be observ wa a veri outspoken woman and i
mai add an honest on
so thi contract wa settl i have set it out at length becaus of
it import in our stori but now i wishah how i wish that i had
insist upon be marri to mari then and there if i had done so
i think i should have carri my point for i wa the master of mani
legion in the shape of cattl food and ammunit and rather than
risk a quarrel with me the other boer would have forc marai to give
wai but we were young and inexperienc also it wa fate otherwis
who can question the decre of fate written immut perhap long
befor we were born in the everlast book of human destini
yet when i had shaken off my first fear and doubt my lot and mari
were veri happi a perfect paradis inde compar with what we had
gone through dure that bitter time of silenc and separ at ani
rate we were acknowledg to be affianc by the littl societi in
which we live includ her father and allow to be as much alon
togeth as we like thi meant that we met at dawn onli to separ
at nightfal for have littl or no artifici light we went to rest
with the sun or shortli after it sweet inde wa that companionship
of perfect trust and love so sweet that even after all these year i
do not care to dwell upon the holi memori of those bless month
so soon as the surviv boer began to recov by the help of my store
and medicin and the meat which i shot in plenti of cours great
discuss aros as to our futur plan first it wa suggest that
we should trek to lorenzo marquez and wait for a ship there to take us
down to natal for none of them would hear of return beggar to the
cape to tell the stori of their failur and dread bereav i
point out howev that no ship might come for a long while perhap
for on or two year and that lorenzo marquez and it neighborhood
seem to be a poison place to live in
the next idea wa that we should stop where we were on which i rather
welcom as i should have been glad to abid in peac with mari until
the six month of probat had gone by
howev in the end thi wa reject for mani good reason thu half
a score of white peopl of whom four were member of a singl famili
were certainli not strong enough to form a settlement especi as the
surround nativ might becom activ hostil at ani moment again
the worst fever season wa approach in which we should veri possibl
all be carri off further we had no breed cattl or hors which
would not live in thi veld and onli the ammunit and good that i
had brought with me
so it wa clear that but on thing remain to be done name to trek
back to what is now the transvaal territori or better still to natal
for thi rout would enabl us to avoid the worst of the mountain
there we might join some other parti of the emigr boersfor choic
that of retief of whose arriv over the drakensberg i wa abl to tell
them
that point settl we made our prepar to begin with i had onli
enough oxen for two wagon wherea even if we abandon the rest
of them we must take at least four therefor through my kaffir i
open negoti with the surround nativ who when thei heard
that i wa not a boer and wa prepar to pai for what i bought soon
express a willing to trade inde veri shortli we had quit a
market establish to which cattl were brought that i bargain for
and purchas give cloth knive hoe and the usual kaffir good in
payment for the same
also thei brought meali and other corn and oh the delight with
which those poor peopl who for month and month had exist upon
noth but fleshmeat at of thi farinac food never shall i
forget see mari and the surviv children partak of their first
meal of porridg and wash the sticki stuff down with draught of
fresh sugar milk for with the oxen i had succeed in obtain two
good cow it is enough to sai that thi chang of diet soon complet
reestablish their health and made mari more beauti than she had
ever been befor
have got the oxen the next thing wa to break them to the yoke for
although docil creatur enough thei had never even seen a wagon
thi prove a long and difficult process involv mani trial trip
moreov the select wagon on of which had belong to pereira
must be mend with veri insuffici tool and without the help of a
forg inde had it not chanc that han the hottentot had work
for a wagonmak at some indefinit period of hi career i do not
think that we could have manag the job at all
it wa while we were busi with these task that some new arriv which
wa unpleas enough to everyon except perhap to henri marai i
wa engag on a certain even in try to make sixteen of the kaffir
cattl pull togeth in the yoke instead of ty themselv into a
doubl knot and overset the wagon when han who wa help me
suddenli call out
look baa here come on of my brother or in other word a
hottentot
follow the line of hi hand i saw a thin and wretch creatur
clad onli in some rag and the remain of a big hat with the crown out
stagger toward us between the tree
why exclaim mari in a startl voic for as usual she wa at my
side it is klau on of my cousin hernan afterrid
so long as it is not your cousin hernan himself i do not care i
said
present the poor starv totti arriv and throw himself down
beg for food a cold shoulder of buck wa given to him which he
devour hold it in both hand and tear off great lump of flesh
with hi teeth like a wild beast
when at last he wa satisfi marai who had come up with the other
boer ask him whenc he came and what wa hi new of hi master
out of the bush he answer and my new of the baa is that he
is dead at least i left him so ill that i suppos he must be dead by
now
why did you leav him if he wa ill ask marai
becaus he told me to baa that i might find help for we were
starv have fire our last bullet
is he alon then
ye ye except for the wild beast and the vultur a lion at the
other man hi servant a long while ago
how far is he off ask marai again
oh baa about five hour journei on horseback on a good road thi
would be some thirtyf mile
then he told thi stori pereira with hi two hottentot servant he
mount and thei on foot had travers about a hundr mile of rough
countri in safeti when at night a lion kill and carri off on of
the hottentot and frighten awai the hors which wa never seen
again pereira and klau proceed on foot till thei came to a great
river on the bank of which thei met some kaffir who appear to have
been zulu on outpost duti these men demand their gun and ammunit
to take to their king and on pereira refus to give them up said
that thei would kill them both in the morn after thei had made him
instruct them in the us of the gun by beat him with stick
in the night a storm came on under cover of which pereira and klau
escap as thei dare not go forward for fear lest thei should fall
into the hand of the zulu thei fled back northward run all
night onli to find in the morn that thei had lost their wai in the
bush thi had happen nearli a month beforeor at ani rate klau
thought so for no doubt the dai went veri slowlydur which time
thei had wander about try to shape some sort of cours by the
sun with the object of return to the camp thei met no man black or
white and support themselv upon game which thei shot and at raw
or sundri till at length all their powder wa done and thei threw
awai their heavi roer which thei could no longer carri
it wa at thi junctur that from the top of a tall tree klau saw
a certain koppi a long wai off which he recognis as be within
fifteen mile or so of maraiss camp by now thei were starv onli
klau wa the stronger of the two for he found and devour some
carrion a dead hyena i think it wa pereira also tri to eat thi
horribl food but not have the stomach of a hottentot the first
mouth of it made him dreadfulli ill thei sought shelter in a cave on
the bank of a stream where grew watercress and other herb such as
wild asparagu here it wa that pereira told klau to try to make hi
wai back to the camp and should he find anyon aliv there to bring
him succour
so klau went take the remain leg of the hyena with him and on
the afternoon of the second dai arriv as ha been told
chapter x vrouw prinsloo speak her mind
now when the hottentot stori wa finish a discuss aros marai
said that someon must go to see whether hi nephew still live to
which the other boer repli ja in an indiffer voic then the
vrouw prinsloo took up her parabl
she remark as she had done befor that in her judgment hernan
pereira wa a stinkcat and a sneak who had tri to desert them in
their troubl and by the judgment of a just god had got into troubl
himself person she wish that the lion had taken him instead of
the worthi hottentot although it gave her a higher opinion of lion to
conclud that it had not done so becaus if it did it thought it would
have been poison well her view wa that it would be just as well to
let that traitor lie upon the bed which he had made moreov doubtless
by now he wa dead so what wa the good of bother about him
these sentiment appear to appeal to the boer for thei remark
ja what is the good
is it right ask marai to abandon a comrad in misfortun on of
our own blood
mein gott repli vrouw prinsloo he is no blood of mine the
evilodour portugue but i admit he is of your heer marai be
your sister son so it is evid that you should be the on to go to
seek after him
that seem to be so vrouw prinsloo said marai in hi medit
manner yet i must rememb that i have mari to look after
ach and so had he too until he rememb hi own skin and went off
with the onli hors and all the powder leav her and the rest of us
to starv well you wont go and prinsloo wont go nor my boi either
for ill see to that so meyer must go
nein nein good vrouw answer meyer i have those children that
ar left to me to consid
then exclaim vrouw prinsloo triumphantli nobodi will go so let
us forget thi stinkcat as he forgot us
doe it seem right ask marai again that a christian man should
be left to starv in the wilder and he look at me
tell me heer marai i remark answer the look why should i
of all peopl go to look for the heer pereira on who ha not dealt too
well with me
i do not know allan yet the book tell us to turn the other cheek and
to forget injuri still it is for you to judg rememb that we
must answer for all thing at the last dai and not for me i onli know
that were i your ag and not burden with a daughter to watch over i
should go
why should you talk to me thu i ask with indign why do
you not go yourself see that i am quit readi to look after mari
here the vrouw prinsloo and the other boer titter and why do you
not address your remark to these other heeren instead of to me see
that thei ar the friend and trekcompanion of your nephew
at thi point the male prinsloo and meyer found that thei had busi
elsewher
it is for you to judg yet rememb allan that it is an aw thing
to appear befor our maker with the blood of a fellow creatur upon our
hand but if you and these other hardheart men will not go i at my
ag and weak as i am with all that i have suffer will go myself
good said vrouw prinsloo that is the best wai out of it you will
soon get sick of the journei heer marai and we shall see no more of
the stinkcat
marai rose in a resign fashion for he never deign to argu with
vrouw prinsloo who wa too mani for him and said
farewel mari if i do not return you will rememb my wish and
my will mai be found between the first leav of our holi book get
up klau and guid me to your master and he administ a somewhat
viciou kick to the gorg and prostrat hottentot
now mari who all thi while had stood silent touch me on the
shoulder and said
allan is it well that my father should go alon will you not
accompani him
of cours i answer cheerfulli on such a busi there should be
two and some kaffir also to carri the man if he still live
now for the end of the stori as the hottentot klau wa too exhaust
to move that night it wa arrang that we should start at dawn
accordingli i rose befor the light and wa just finish my
breakfast when mari appear at the wagon in which i slept i got up
to greet her and there be no on in sight we kiss each other
sever time
have done my heart she said push me awai i come to you from my
father who is sick in hi stomach and would see you
which mean that i shall have to go after your cousin alon i repli
with indign emphasi
she shook her head and led me to the littl shanti in which she slept
here by the grow light that enter through the doorwai for it had
no window i perceiv marai seat upon a wooden stool with hi hand
press on hi middl and groan
good morn allan he said in a melancholi voic i am ill veri
ill someth that i have eaten perhap or a chill in the stomach
such as often preced fever or dysenteri
perhap you will get better as you walk mynheer i suggest for
to tell the truth i misdoubt me of thi chill and knew that he had
eaten noth but what wa quit wholesom
walk god alon know how i can walk with someth grip my insid
like a wagonmak vice yet i will try for it is imposs to leav
that poor hernan to die alon and if i do not go to seek him it seem
that no on els will
why should not some of my kaffir go with klau i ask
allan he repli solemnli if you were dy in a cave far from
help would you think well of those who sent raw kaffir to succour you
when thei might have come themselv kaffir who certainli would let
you die and return with some fals stori
i dont know what i should think heer marai but i do know that if
i were in that cave and pereira were in thi camp neither would he
come himself nor so much as send a savag to save me
it mai be so allan but even if anoth heart is black should your
be black also oh i will come though it be to my death and rise
from the stool with the most dread groan he began to divest himself
of the tatter blanket in which he wa wrap up
oh allan my father must not go it will kill him exclaim mari
who took a more seriou view of hi case than i did
veri well if you think so i answer and now as it is time for me
to be start goodby
you have a good heart allan said marai sink back upon hi stool
and resum hi blanket while mari look despairingli first at on
and then at the other of us
half an hour later i wa on the road in the veri worst of temper
mind what you ar about call vrouw prinsloo after me it is not
lucki to save an enemi and if i know anyth of that stinkcat he will
bite your finger badli by wai of gratitud bah lad if i were you i
should just camp for a few dai in the bush and then come back and sai
that i could find noth of pereira except the dead hyena that had
been poison by eat him good luck to you all the same allan mai
i find such a friend in need it seem to me that you were born to help
other
besid the hottentot klau my companion on thi unwelcom journei were
three of the zulu kaffir for han i wa oblig to leav in charg
of my cattl and good with the other men also i took a packox an
activ beast that i had been train to carri load and if necessari a
man although as yet it wa not veri well broken
all that dai we march over extrem rough countri till at last
dark found us in a mountain kloof where we slept surround
by watchfir becaus of the lion next morn at the first light we
move on again and about ten oclock wade through a stream to a littl
natur cave where klau said he had left hi master thi cave seem
extrem silent and as i hesit for a moment at it mouth the
thought cross my mind that if pereira were still there he must be
dead inde do what i would to suppress it with that reflect came
a certain feel of relief and even of pleasur for well i knew that
pereira aliv wa more danger to me than all the wild men and beast
in africa put togeth thrust back thi unworthi sentiment as best
i could i enter the cave alon for the nativ who dread the
defil of the touch of a corps linger outsid
it wa but a shallow caviti wash out of the overhang rock by the
action of water and as soon as my ey grew accustom to it gloom i
saw that at the end of it lai a man so still did he lie that now i wa
almost certain that hi troubl were over i went up to him and touch
hi face which wa cold and clammi and then quit convinc turn
to leav the place which i thought if a few rock were pile in the
mouth of it would make an excel sepulchr
just as i step out into the sunlight and wa about to call to the
men to collect the rock howev i thought that i heard a veri faint
groan behind me which at the moment i set down to imagin still i
return though i did not much like the job knelt down by the figur
and wait with my hand over it heart for five minut or more i
stai here and then quit convinc wa about to leav again when
for the second time i heard that faint groan pereira wa not dead but
onli on the extrem brink of death
i ran to the entranc of the cave call the kaffir and togeth we
carri him out into the sunlight he wa an aw spectacl mere bone
with yellow skin stretch over it and cover with filth and clot
blood from some hurt i had brandi with me of which i pour a littl
down hi throat whereon hi heart began to beat feebli then we made
some soup and pour that down hi throat with more brandi and the end
of it wa he came to life again
for three dai did i doctor that man and realli i believ that if at
ani time dure those dai i had relax my attent even for a coupl
of hour he would have slip through my finger for at thi busi
klau and the kaffir were no good at all but i pull him round and
on the third morn he came to hi sens for a long while he stare
at me for i had laid him in the mouth of the cave where the light wa
good although the overhang rock protect him from the sun then he
said
allemacht you remind me of someon young man i know it is of
that damn english boi who beat me at the goos shoot and made me
quarrel with oom uncl retief the jackanap that mari wa so fond
of well whoever you ar you cant be he thank god
you ar mistaken heer pereira i answer i am that same damn
young english jackanap allan quatermain by name who beat you at
shoot but if you take my advic you will thank god for someth
els name that your life ha been save
who save it he ask
if you want to know i did i have been nurs you these three dai
you allan quatermain now that is strang for certainli i would not
have save your and he laugh a littl then turn over and went to
sleep
from that time forward hi recoveri wa rapid and two dai later we
began our journei back to maraiss camp the convalesc pereira be
carri in a litter by the four nativ it wa a task at which thei
grumbl a good deal for the load wa heavi over rough ground and
whenev thei stumbl or shook him he curs at them so much did
he curs inde that at length on of the zulu a man with a rough
temper said that if it were not for the inkoo mean myself he
would put hi assegai through him and let the vultur carri him after
thi pereira grew much more polit when the bearer becam exhaust
we set him on the packox which two of us led while the other two
support him on either side it wa in thi fashion that at last we
arriv at the camp on even
here the vrouw prinsloo wa the first to greet us we found her stand
in the game path which we were follow quit a quarter of a mile from
the wagon with her hand set upon her broad hip and her feet
apart her attitud wa so defiant and had about it such an air of
premedit that i cannot help think she had got wind of our
return perhap from have seen the smoke of our last fire and wa
watch for us also her greet wa warm
ah here you come hernan pereira she cri ride on an ox while
better men walk well now i want a chat with you how came it that you
went off in the night take the onli hors and all the powder
i went to get help for you he repli sulkili
did you did you inde well it seem that it wa you who want the
help after all what do you mean to pai the heer allan quatermain for
save your life for i am sure he ha done so you have got no good
left although you were alwai boast about your rich thei ar now
at the bottom of a river so it will have to be in love and servic
he mutter someth about my want no payment for a christian act
no he want no payment hernan pereira he is on of the true sort
but youll pai him all the same and in bad coin if you get the chanc
oh i have come out to tell you what i think of you you ar a stinkcat
do you hear that a thing that no dog would bite if he could help it
you ar a traitor also you brought us to thi curs countri where
you said your rel would give us wealth and land and then after
famin and fever attack us you rode awai and left us to die to save
your own dirti skin and now you come back here for help save by him
whom you cheat in the goos kloof by him whose true love you have
tri to steal oh mein gott why doe the almighti leav such fellow
aliv while so mani that ar good and honest and innoc lie beneath
the soil becaus of stinkcat like you
so she went on stride at the side of the packox and revil
pereira in a ceaseless stream of languag until at length he thrust hi
thumb into hi ear and glare at her in speechless wrath
thu it wa that at last we arriv in the camp where have seen
us come all the boer were gather thei ar not a particularli
humor peopl but thi spectacl of the advanc of pereira seat on
the packox a steed that is becom to few rider with the furiou
and portli vrouw prinsloo stride at hi side and shriek abus at
him caus them to burst into laughter then pereira temper gave out
and he becam even more abus than vrouw prinsloo
is thi the wai you receiv me you veldhog you common boer who
ar not fit to mix with a man of posit and learn like myself he
began
then in god name why do you mix with us hernan pereira ask the
saturnin meyer thrust hi face forward till the newgat fring he
wore by wai of a beard liter seem to curl with wrath when we
were hungri you did not wish it for you slunk awai and left us take
all the powder but now that we ar full again thank to the littl
englishman and you ar hungri you come back well if i had my wai i
would give you a gun and six dai ration and turn you out to shift
for yourself
dont be afraid jan meyer shout pereira from the back of the
packox as soon as i am strong enough i will leav you in charg of
your english captain hereand he point to meand go to tell our
peopl what sort of folk you ar
that is good new interrupt prinsloo a stolid old boer who stood
by puf at hi pipe get well get well as soon as you can hernan
pereira
it wa at thi junctur that marai arriv accompani by mari where
he came from i do not know but i think he must have been keep in the
background on purpos to see what kind of a recept pereira would meet
with
silenc brother he said is thi the wai you greet my nephew who
ha return from the gate of death when you should be on your knee
thank god for hi deliver
then go on your knee and thank him yourself henri marai scream
the irrepress vrouw prinsloo i give thank for the safe return of
allan here though it is true thei would be warmer if he had left thi
stinkcat behind him allemacht henri marai why do you make so much
of thi portugues fellow ha he bewitch you or is it becaus he
is your sister son or becaus you want to forc mari there to marri
him or is it perhap that he know of someth bad in your past
life and you have to bribe him to keep hi mouth shut
now whether thi last unpleas suggest wa a mere random arrow
drawn from vrouw prinsloo wellstor quiver or whether the vrouw had
got hold of the tailend of some longburi truth i do not know of
cours howev the latter explan is possibl mani men have done
thing in their youth which thei do not wish to see dug up in their
ag and pereira mai have learn a famili secret of the kind from hi
mother
at ani rate the effect of the old ladi word upon marai wa quit
remark suddenli he went into on of hi violent and constitut
rage he curs vrouw prinsloo he curs everybodi els assur them
sever and collect that heaven would come even with them he
said there wa a plot against him and hi nephew and that i wa at the
bottom of it i who had made hi daughter fond of my ugli littl face
so furiou were hi word whereof there were mani more which i have
forgotten that at length mari began to cry and ran awai present
too the boer stroll off shrug their shoulder on of them
sai audibl that marai had gone quit mad at last as he alwai
thought he would
then marai follow them throw up hi arm and still curs as he
went and slip over the tail of the packox pereira follow him
so the vrouw prinsloo and i were left alon for the colour men had
depart as thei alwai do when white peopl begin to quarrel
there allan my boi said the vrouw in triumph i have found the
sore place on the mule back and didnt i make him squeal and kick
although on most dai of the week he seem to be such a good and quiet
muleat ani rate of late
i dare sai you did vrouw i said wrathfulli but i wish you would
leav mynheer maraiss sore place alon see that if the squeal ar
for you the kick ar for me
what doe that matter allan she ask he alwai wa your enemi
so that it is just as well you should see hi heel when you ar out
of reach of them my poor boi i think you will have a bad time of it
between the stinkcat and the mule although you have done so much for
both of them well there is on thingmari ha a true heart she will
never marri ani man except yourself allaneven if you ar not here to
marri she ad by an afterthought
the old ladi paus a littl stare at the ground then she look up
and said
allan my dear for she wa realli fond of me and call me thu
at time you didnt take the advic i gave you name to look for
pereira and not to find him well i will give you some more which you
will take if you ar wise
what is it i ask doubtfulli for although she wa upright enough
in her own wai the vrouw prinsloo could bring herself to look at thing
in strang light like mani other women she judg of moral code by
the impuls of her heart and wa quit prepar to stretch them
to suit circumst or to gain an end which she consid good in
itself
just thi lad do you make a two dai march with mari into the bush
i want a littl chang so i will come too and marri you there for i
have got a prayerbook and can spell out the servic if we go through
it onc or twice first
now the vision of mari and myself be marri by the vrouw prinsloo
in the vast and untrodden veld although attract wa so absurd that
i laugh
why do you laugh allan anyon can marri peopl if there is no on
els there inde i believ that thei can marri themselv
i dare sai i answer not wish to enter into a legal argument
with the vrouw but you see tant i solemnli promis her father that
i would not marri her until she wa of ag and if i broke my word i
should not be an honest man
an honest man she exclaim with the utmost contempt an honest man
well ar marai and hernan pereira honest men why do you not cut your
stick the same length as their allan quatermain i tell you that your
verdomd honesti will be your ruin you rememb my word later on and
she march off in high dudgeon
when she had gone i went to my wagon where han wa wait for me
with a detail and intermin report of everyth that had happen
in my absenc glad wa i to find that except for the death of on
sickli ox noth had gone wrong when at length he had end hi long
stori i at some food which mari sent over for me readi cook for
i wa too tire to join ani of the boer that night just as i had
finish my meal and wa think of turn in mari herself appear
within the circl of the campfir light i sprang up and ran to her
sai that i had not expect to see her that even and did not like
to come to the hous
no she answer draw me back into the shadow i understand
my father seem veri much upset almost mad inde if the vrouw
prinsloo tongu had been a snake fang it could not have stung him
wors
and where is pereira i ask
oh my cousin sleep in the other room he is weak and worn out all
the same allan he want to kiss me so i told him at onc how matter
stood between you and me and that we were to be marri in six month
what did he sai to that i ask

father answer ye that is the best bargain i could make with the
englishman see that you were not here to make a better

to try to find help for all of you i fail meanwhil the englishman
came and save you afterward he save me also uncl in all thi
i see god hand had it not been for thi allan none of us would be
aliv ye god us him that we might be kept aliv well he ha
promis that he will not marri mari for six month and you know
my uncl that some of these english ar great fool thei keep their
promis even to their own loss now in six month much mai happen who
know what will happen
were you present when you heard all thi mari i ask
no allan i wa the other side of the reed partit but at
those word i enter and said my father and cousin hernan pleas
understand that there is on thing which will never happen
what is that ask my cousin
it will never happen that i shall marri you hernan i repli
who know mari who know he said

nor six year nor six thousand year ar long enough to make me marri
ani man except allan quatermain who ha just rescu you from death do
you understand
ye he repli i understand that you will not marri me onli then
i promis that you shall not marri either allan quatermain or ani other
man

father togeth and now allan tell me all that ha happen sinc we

so i told her everyth includ the vrouw prinsloo advic
of cours allan you were quit right she remark when i had
finish but i am not sure that the vrouw prinsloo wa not also right
in her own fashion i am afraid of my cousin hernan who hold my father
in hi handfast fast still we have promis and must keep our
word
chapter xi the shot in the kloof
i think it wa about three week after these event that we began our
southward trek on the morn subsequ to our arriv at maraiss
camp pereira came up to me when sever peopl were present and
take my hand thank me in a loud voic for have save hi life
thenceforward he declar i should be dearer to him than a brother
for wa there not a blood bond between us
i answer i did not think ani such bond exist inde i wa not sure
what it meant i had done my duti by him neither less nor more and
there wa noth further to be said
it turn out howev that there wa a great deal further to be said
sinc pereira desir to borrow monei or rather good from me he
explain that ow to the prejudic of the vulgar boer who remain
aliv in that camp and especi of the scandaloustongu vrouw
prinsloo both he and hi uncl had come to the conclus that it would
be wise for him to remov himself as soon as possibl therefor he
propos to trek awai alon
i answer that i should have thought he had done enough solitari
travel in thi veld see how hi last expedit had end he
repli that he had inde but everyon here wa so bitter against him
that no choic wa left then he ad with an outburst of truth
allemacht mynheer quatermain do you suppos that it is pleasant for
me to see you make love all dai to the maid who wa my betroth and
to see her pai back the love with her ey ye and doubtless with
her lip too from all i hear
you could leav her whom you call your betroth but who never wa
betroth to anyon but me with her own will to starv in the veld
mynheer why then should you be angri becaus i pick up that which
you threw awai that too which wa alwai my own and not your had it
not been for me there would now be no maid left for us to quarrel over
as had it not been for me there would be no man left for me to quarrel
with about the maid
ar you god then englishman that you dispos of the live of men and
women at your will it wa he who save us not you
he mai have save you but it wa through me i carri out the rescu
of these poor peopl whom you desert and i nurs you back to life
i did not desert them i went to get help for them
take all the powder and the onli hors with you well that is done
with and now you want to borrow good to pai for cattlefrom me whom
you hate you ar not proud mynheer pereira when you have an end
to serv whatev that end mai be and i look at him my instinct
warn me against thi fals and treacher man who i felt wa even
then plot in hi heart to bring some evil upon me
no i am not proud why should i be see that i mean to repai you
twice over for anyth which you mai lend me now
i reflect a while certainli our journei to natal would be pleasant
if pereira were not of the compani also if he went with us i wa sure
that befor we came to the end of that trek on or other of us would
leav hi bone on the road in short not to put too fine a point on
it i fear lest in thi wai or in that he would bring me to my death
in order that he might possess himself of mari we were in a wild
countri with few wit and no law court where such deed might
be done again and again and the doer never call to account for lack of
evid and judg
so i made up my mind to fall in with hi wish and we began to
bargain the end of it wa that i advanc him enough of my remain
good to bui the cattl he requir from the surround nativ it wa
no great quantiti after all see that in thi uncivilis place
an ox could be purchas for a few string of bead or a cheap knife
further i sold him a few of the beast that i had broken a gun some
ammunit and certain other necessari for all of which thing he
gave me a note of hand written in my pocketbook inde i did more
for as none of the boer would help him i assist pereira to break in
the cattl he bought and even consent when he ask me to give him
the servic of two of the zulu whom i had hire
all these prepar took a long while if i rememb right twelv
more dai had gone by befor pereira final trek off from maraiss
camp by which time he wa quit well and strong again
we all assembl to see the start and marai offer up a prayer for
hi nephew safe journei and our happi meet again in natal at the
laager of retief which wa to be our rendezv if that leader were
still in natal no on els join in the prayer onli vrouw prinsloo
audibl ad anoth of her own it wa to the effect that he might not
come back a second time and that she might never see hi face again
either at retief laager or anywher els if it would pleas the good
lord so to arrang matter
the boer titter even the meyer children titter for by thi time
the hatr of the vrouw prinsloo for hernan pereira wa the joke of the
place but pereira himself pretend not to hear said goodby to us
all affection ad a special petit for the vrouw prinsloo
and off we went
i sai we went becaus with my usual luck to help him with the
halfbroken oxen i wa command to accompani thi man to hi first
outspan a place with good water about twelv mile from the camp where
he propos to remain for the night
now as we start about ten oclock in the morn and the veld wa
fairli level i expect that we should reach thi outspan by three
or four in the afternoon which would give me time to walk back befor
sunset in fact howev so mani accid happen of on sort or
anoth both to the wagon itself of which the woodwork had shrunk with
long stand in the sun and to the cattl which be unus to the
yoke ti themselv in a doubl knot upon everi opportun that we
onli arriv there at the approach of night
the last mile of that trek wa through a narrow gorg cut out by water
in the nativ rock here tree grew spars also great fern but the
bottom of the gorg along which game were accustom to travel wa
smooth enough for wagon save for a few fallen boulder which it wa
necessari to avoid
when at length we reach the outspan i ask the hottentot klau who
wa assist me to drive the team where hi master wa for i could
not see him anywher he answer that he had gone back down the kloof
to look for someth that had fallen from the wagon a bolt i think he
said
veri good i repli then tell him if we do not meet that i have
return to the camp
as i set out the sun wa sink below the horizon but thi did not
troubl me overmuch as i had a rifl with me that same light rifl
with which i had shot the gees in the great match also i knew that the
moon be full would be up present
the sun sank and the kloof wa plung in gloom the place seem
eeri and lonesom and suddenli i grew afraid i began to wonder where
pereira wa and what he might be do i even thought of turn
back and find some wai round onli have explor all thi district
pretti thoroughli in my variou shoot expedit from the camp i
knew there wa no practic path across those hill so i went on
with my rifl at full cock whistl to keep up my courag which of
cours in the circumst wa a foolish thing to do it occur to
me at the time that it wa foolish but in truth i would not give wai
to the dark suspicion which cross my mind doubtless by now pereira
had pass me and reach the outspan
the moon began to shinethat wonder african moon which turn night
to daythrow a network of long black shadow of tree and
rock across the game track i wa follow right ahead of me wa a
particularli dark patch of thi shadow caus by a project wall of
cliff and beyond it an equal bright patch of moonlight somehow i
misdoubt me of that stretch of gloom for although of cours i could
see noth there my quick ear caught the sound of movement
i halt for a moment then reflect that these were doubtless caus
by some nightwalk creatur which even should it chanc to be
danger would flee at the approach of man i plung into it boldli
as i emerg at the other endth shadow wa eighteen or twenti pace
longit occur to me that if ani enemi were lurk there i should
be an easi target as i enter the line of clear light so almost
instinct for i do not rememb that i reason the thing out
after my first two step forward in the light i gave a littl spring to
the left where there wa still shadow although it wa not deep well
wa it for me that i did so for at that moment i felt someth touch
my cheek and heard the loud report of a gun immedi behind me
now the wisest cours would have been for me to run befor whoever
had fire found time to reload but a kind of furi seiz me and run i
would not on the contrari i turn with a shout and charg back into
the shadow someth heard me come someth fled in front of me in
a few second we were out into the moonlight beyond and as i expect
i saw that thi someth wa a manpereira
he halt and wheel round lift the stock of hi gun club fashion
thank god it is you heer allan he said i thought you were a
tiger
then it is your last thought murder i answer rais my rifl
dont shoot he said would you have my blood upon you why do you
want to kill me
why did you try to kill me i answer cover him
i try to kill you ar you mad listen for your own sake i sat down
on the bank yonder wait for the moon and be tire fell asleep
then i woke up with a start and think from the sound that a tiger
wa after me fire to scare it allemacht man if i had aim at you
could i have miss at that distanc
you did not quit miss and had i not step to the left you would
have blown my head off sai your prayer you dog
allan quatermain he exclaim with desper energi you think i
lie who speak the truth kill me if you will onli then rememb that
you will hang for it we court on woman that is known and who will
believ thi stori of your that i tri to shoot you soon the kaffir
will come to look for me probabl thei ar start alreadi and will
find my bodi with your bullet in my heart then thei will take it back
to maraiss camp and i saywho will believ your stori
some i think murder but as i spoke the word a chill of fear
struck me it wa true i could prove noth have no wit and
henceforward i should be a cain among the boer on who had slain a man
for jealousi hi gun wa empti ye but it might be said that i had
fire it after hi death and as for the graze upon my cheekwhi a
twig might have caus it what should i do then drive him befor
me to the camp and tell thi tale even then it would be but my word
against hi no he had me in a fork stick i must let him go and
trust that heaven would aveng hi crime sinc i could not moreov
by now my first rage wa cool and to execut a man thu
hernan pereira i said you ar a liar and a coward you tri to
butcher me becaus mari love me and hate you and you want to forc
her to marri you yet i cannot shoot you down in cold blood as you
deserv i leav it to god to punish you as soon or late he will
here or hereaft you who thought to slaughter me and trust to the
hyena to hide your crime as thei would have done befor morn get
you gone befor i chang my mind and be swift
without anoth word he turn and ran swiftli as a buck leap from
side to side as he ran to disturb my aim in case i should shoot
when he wa a hundr yard awai or more i too turn and ran never
feel safe till i knew there wa a mile of ground between us
it wa past ten oclock that night when i got back to the camp where i
found han the hottentot about to start to look for me with two of the
zulu and told him that i had been detain by accid to the wagon
the vrouw prinsloo wa still up also wait to hear of my arriv
what wa the accid allan she ask it look as though there had
been a bullet in it and she point to the bloodi smear upon my cheek
i nod
pereira she ask again
i nod a second time
did you kill him
no i let him go it would have been said that i murder him and i
told her what had happen
ja allan she remark when i had finish i think you were wise
for you could have prove noth but oh for what fate i wonder is
god almighti save up that stinkcat well i will go and tell mari
that you ar back safe for her father wont let her out of the hut so
late but noth more unless you wish it
no tant i think noth more at ani rate at present
here i mai state howev that within a few dai mari and everyon
els in the camp knew the stori in detail except perhap marai to
whom no on spoke of hi nephew evid vrouw prinsloo had found
herself unabl to keep secret such an exampl of the villaini of her
avers pereira so she told her daughter who told the other quickli
enough though i gather that some of them set down what had happen
to accid bad as thei knew pereira to be thei could not believ that
he wa guilti of so black a crime
about a week later the rest of us start from maraiss camp a place
that notwithstand the sad of mani of it associ i confess
i left with some regret the trek befor us although not so veri long
wa of an extrem peril natur we had to pass through about two
hundr mile of countri of which all we knew wa that it inhabit
were the amatonga and other savag tribe here i should explain that
after much discuss we had abandon the idea of retrac the rout
follow by marai on hi illfat journei toward delagoa
had we taken thi it would have involv our cross the terribl
lobombo mountain over which it wa doubt whether our light cattl
could drag the wagon moreov the countri beyond the mountain wa
said to be veri bare of game and also of kaffir so that food might be
lack on the other hand if we kept to the east of the mountain the
veld through which we must pass wa thickli popul which meant that
in all probabl we could bui grain
what final decid us to adopt thi rout howev wa that here in
these warm lowli land there would be grass for the oxen inde
now at the begin of spring in thi part of africa it wa alreadi
push even if it were not the beast could live upon what herbag
remain over from last summer and on the leav of tree neither of
which in thi winter veld ever becom quit lifeless wherea on the
sere and fireswept plain beyond the mountain thei might find noth
at all so we determin to risk the savag and the lion which
follow the game into these hot district especi as it wa not yet
the fever season or that of the heavi rain so that the river would be
fordabl
i do not propos to set out our adventur in detail for these would be
too long until the great on of which i shall have to tell present
thei were of an annoi rather than of a seriou natur travel as
we did between the mountain and the sea we could not well lose our
wai especi as my zulu had pass through that countri and when
their knowledg fail us we gener manag to secur the servic
of local guid the road howev or rather the game track and
kaffir path which we follow were terribl for with the singl
except of that of pereira for part of the distanc no wagon had ever
gone over them befor inde a littl later in the year thei could not
have been travel at all sometim we stuck in bog out of which we
had to dig the wheel and sometim in the rocki bottom of stream
while onc we were oblig liter to cut our wai through a belt of
dens bush from which it took us eight dai to escap
our other chief troubl came from the lion whereof there were great
number in thi veld the preval of these hungri beast forc us to
watch our cattl veri close while thei graze and at night wherev
it wa possibl to protect them and ourselv in bombast or
fenc of thorn within which we lit fire to scare awai wild beast
notwithstand these precaut we lost sever of the oxen and
ourselv had some narrow escap
thu on night just as mari wa about to enter the wagon where the
women slept a great lion desper with hunger sprang over the fenc
she leapt awai from the beast and in so do caught her foot and fell
down whereon the lion came for her in anoth few second she would
have been dead or carri off live
but as it chanc vrouw prinsloo wa close at hand seiz a flame
bough from the fire that intrepid woman ran at the lion and as it
open it huge mouth to roar or bite thrust the burn end of the
bough into it throat the lion close it jaw upon it then find
the mouth not to it tast depart even more quickli than it had
come utter the most dread nois and leav mari quit unhurt
needless to sai after thi i realli worship the vrouw prinsloo
though she good soul thought noth of the busi which in those
dai wa but a common incid of travel
i think it wa on the dai after thi lion episod that we came upon
pereira wagon or rather it remain evid he had tri to trek
along a steep rocki bank which overhung a stream with the result that
the wagon had fallen into the streamb then almost dry and been
smash beyond repair
the tonga nativ of the neighbourhood who had burn most of the
woodwork in order to secur the preciou iron bolt and fit
inform us that the white man and hi servant who were with the wagon
had gone forward on foot some ten dai befor drive their cattl with
them whether thi stori were true or not we had no mean of find
out it wa quit possibl that pereira and hi companion had been
murder though as we found the tonga veri quiet folk if well treat
and given the usual complimentari present for wayleav thi did not
seem probabl inde a week later our doubt upon thi point were
clear up thu
we had reach a big kraal call fokoti on the umkusi river which
appear to be almost desert we ask an old woman whom we met where
it peopl had gone she answer that thei had fled toward the border
of swaziland fear an attack from the zulu whose territori began
beyond thi umkusi river it seem that a few dai befor a zulu impi
or regiment had appear upon the bank of the river and although there
wa no war at the time between the zulu and the tonga the latter had
thought it wise to put themselv out of reach of those terribl spear
on hear thi new we debat whether it would not be well for us to
follow their exampl and trek westward try to find a pass in the
mountain upon thi point there wa a divis of opinion among us
marai who wa a fatalist wish to go on sai that the good lord
would protect us as he had done in the past
allemacht answer the vrouw prinsloo did he protect all those who
lie dead at maraiss camp whither your folli led us mynheer the good
lord expect us to look after our own skin and i know that these zulu
ar of the same blood as umsilikazi kaffir who have kill so mani
of our peopl let us try the mountain sai i
of cours her husband and son agre with her for to them the vrouw
word wa law but marai be as usual obstin would not give
wai all that afternoon thei wrangl while i held my tongu declar
that i wa will to abid by the decis of the major in the end
as i foresaw thei would thei appeal to me to act as umpir between
them
friend i answer if you had ask me my opinion befor i should
have vote for try the mountain beyond which perhap we might
find some boer i do not like thi stori of the zulu impi i think
that someon ha told them of our come and that it is us thei mean to
attack and not the tonga with whom thei ar at peac my men sai that
it is not usual for impi to visit thi part of the countri
who could have told them ask marai
i dont know mynheer perhap the nativ have sent on word or
perhapshernan pereira
i knew that you would suspect my nephew allan he exclaim angrili
i suspect no on i onli weigh what is probabl howev it is too
late for us to move tonight either south or westward so i think i
will sleep over the busi and see what i can find out from my zulu
that night or rather the follow morn the question wa settl
for us for when i woke up at dawn it wa to see the faint light
glimmer on what i knew must be spear we were surround by a great
compani of zulu as i discov afterward over two hundr strong
think that after their fashion thei were prepar to attack us at
dawn i call the new to the other whereon marai rush forward
just as he had left hi bed cock hi roer as he came
for the love of god do not shoot i said how can we resist so mani
soft word ar our onli chanc
still he attempt to fire and would have done so had i not thrown
myself upon him and liter torn the gun from hi hand by thi time
the vrouw prinsloo had come up a veri weird spectacl i recollect in
what she call her sleepgar that includ a nightcap made of
a worn jackal skin and a kind of otterpelt stomach
accurs fool she said to marai would you caus all our throat to
be cut go forward you allan and talk to those swartzel that
is black creatur gentli as you would to a savag dog you have a
tongu steep in oil and thei mai listen to you
ye i answer that seem the best thing to do if i should not
return give my love to mari
so i beckon to the headman of my zulu whom i had hire at delagoa to
accompani me and march forward boldli quit unarm we were encamp
upon a rise of ground a quarter of a mile from the river and the impi
or those of them whom we could see were at the foot of thi rise about
a hundr and sixti yard awai the light wa grow now and when i
wa within fifti pace of them thei saw me at some word of command a
number of men rush toward me their fight shield held over their
bodi and their spear up
we ar dead exclaim my kaffir in a resign voic i share hi
opinion but thought i might as well die stand as run awai
now i should explain that though as yet i had never mix with these
zulu i could talk sever nativ dialect kindr to that which thei
us veri well inde moreov ever sinc i had hire men of their
race at delagoa i had spent all my spare time in convers with them
and acquir a knowledg of their languag histori and custom so by
thi time i knew their tongu fairli although occasion i mai have
us term which were unfamiliar to them
thu it came about that i wa abl to shout to them ask what wa
their busi with us hear themselv address in word which thei
understood the men halt and see that i wa unarm three of them
approach me
we come to take you prison white peopl or to kill you if you
resist said their captain
by whose order i ask
by the order of dingaan our king
is it so and who told dingaan that we were here
the boer who came in front of you
is it so i said again and now what do you need of us
that you should accompani us to the kraal of dingaan
i understand we ar quit will sinc it li upon our road but
then why do you come against us who ar peac travel with your
spear lift
for thi reason the boer told us that there is among you a child of
georg an englishman a terribl man who would kill us unless we
kill or bound him first show us thi child of georg that we mai make
him fast or slai him and we will not hurt the rest of you
i am the child of georg i answer and if you think it necessari
to make me fast do so
now the zulu burst out laugh
you why you ar but a boi who weigh no more than a fat girl
exclaim their captain a great boni fellow who wa name kambula
that mai be so i answer but sometim the wisdom of their father
dwell in the young i am the son of georg who save these boer from
death far awai and i am take them back to their own peopl we desir
to see dingaan your king be pleas therefor to lead us to him as he
ha command you to do if you do not believ what i tell you ask thi
man who is with me and hi companion who ar of your own race thei
will tell you everyth
then the captain kambula call my servant apart and talk with him for
a long while
when the interview wa finish he advanc to me and said
now i have heard all about you i have heard that although young you
ar veri clever so clever that you do not sleep but watch by night
as well as by dai therefor that i kambula name you macumazahn
watcherbynight and by that name you shall henceforth be known among
us now macumazahn son of georg bring out these boer whom you ar
guid that i mai lead them in their move hut to the great place
umgungundhlovu where dwell dingaan the king see we lai down our
spear and will come to meet them unarm trust to you to protect
us o macumazahn son of georg and he cast hi assegai to the ground
come i said and led them to the wagon
chapter xii dingaan bet
as i advanc to the wagon accompani by kambula and hi two
companion i saw that marai in a state of great excit wa
engag in harangu the two prinsloo men and meyer while the vrouw
prinsloo and mari appear to be attempt to calm him
thei ar unarm i heard him shout let us seiz the black devil
and hold them as hostag
thereon led by marai the three boer men came toward us doubtfulli
their gun in their hand
be care what you ar do i call to them these ar envoi
and thei hung back a littl while marai went on with hi harangu
the zulu look at them and at me then kambula said
ar you lead us into a trap son of georg
not so i answer but the boer ar afraid of you and think to take
you prison
tell them said kambula quietli that if thei kill us or lai a hand
on us as no doubt thei can do veri soon everi on of them will be dead
and their women with them
i repeat thi ultimatum energet enough but marai shout
the englishman is betrai us to the zulu do not trust him seiz
them as i tell you
what would have happen i am sure i do not know but just then the
vrouw prinsloo came up and caught her husband by the arm exclaim
you shall have no part in thi fool busi if marai wish to
seiz the zulu let him do so himself ar you mad or drunk that you
should think that allan would wish to betrai mari to the kaffir to
sai noth of the rest of us and she began to wave an extrem dirti
vatdoek or dishcloth which she alwai carri about with her and
us for everi purpos toward kambula as a sign of peac
now the boer gave wai and marai see himself in a minor
glower at me in silenc
ask these white peopl o macumazahn said kambula who is their
captain for to the captain i would speak
i translat the question and marai answer
i am
no broke in vrouw prinsloo i am tell them allan that these men
ar all fool and have given the rule to me a woman
so i told them evid thi inform surpris them a littl for
thei discuss togeth then kambula said
so be it we have heard that the peopl of georg ar now rule by a
woman and as you macumazahn ar on of that peopl doubtless it is
the same among your parti
here i mai add that thenceforward the zulu alwai accept the vrouw
prinsloo as the inkosikaa or chieftai of our littl band and
with the singl except of myself whom thei look upon as her
mouth or induna would onli transact busi with or give direct
to her the other boer thei ignor complet
thi point of etiquett settl kambula bade me repeat what he had
alreadi told me that we were prison whom he wa instruct by
dingaan to convei to hi great place and that if we made no attempt to
escap we should not be hurt upon the journei
i did so whereon the vrouw ask as i had done who had inform
dingaan that we were come
i repeat to her word for word what the zulu had told me that it
wa pereira whose object seem to have been to bring about my death or
captur
then the vrouw explod
do you hear that henri marai she scream it is your stinkcat of
a nephew again oh i thought i smelt him your nephew ha betrai us
to these zulu that he mai bring allan to hi death ask them allan
what thi dingaan ha done with the stinkcat
so i ask and wa inform thei believ that the king had let pereira
go on to hi own peopl in payment of the inform that he had given
him
my god said the vrouw i hope that he had knock him on the head
well what is to be done now
i dont know i answer then an idea occur to me and i said to
kambula
it seem to be me the son of georg that your king want take me
and let these peopl go on their road
the three zulu began to discuss thi point withdraw themselv
a littl wai so that i could not overhear them but when the boer
understood the offer that i had made mari who until now had been
silent grew more angri than ever i had seen her befor
it shall not be she said stamp her foot father i have been
obedi to you for long but if you consent to thi i will be obedi
no more allan save my cousin hernan life as he save all our
live in payment for that good deed hernan tri to murder him in the
kloofoh be quiet allan i know all the stori now he ha betrai
him to the zulu tell them that he is a terribl and danger man
who must be kill well if he is to be kill i will be kill with
him and if the zulu take him and let us free i go with him now make
up your mind
marai tug at hi beard stare first at hi daughter and then
at me what he would have answer i do not know for at that moment
kambula step forward and gave hi decis
it wa to the effect that although it wa the son of georg whom dingaan
want hi order were that all with him were to be taken also those
order could not be disobei the king would settl the matter as to
whether some of us were to be kill and some let free or if all
were to be kill or let free when we reach hi hous therefor he
command that we should tie the oxen to the move hut and cross the
river at onc
thi wa the end of that scene have no choic we inspan and
continu our journei escort by the compani of two hundr savag
i am bound to sai that dure the four or five dai that it took us to
reach dingaan kraal thei behav veri well to us with kambula and
hi offic all of them good fellow in their wai i had mani
convers and from them learn much as to the state and custom
of the zulu also the peopl of the district through which we pass
flock round us at everi outspan for most of them had never seen a
white man befor and in return for a few bead brought us all the food
that we requir inde the bead or their equival were noth
but a present sinc by the king command thei must satisfi our
want thi thei did veri thoroughli for instanc when on the last
dai trek some of our oxen gave out number of zulu were inspan
in place of them and by their help the wagon were drag to the great
kraal umgungundhlovu
here an outspan place wa assign to us near to the hous or rather
the hut of a certain missionari of the name of owen who with great
courag had ventur into thi countri we were receiv with the utmost
kind by him and hi wife and household and it is imposs for me
to sai what pleasur i found after all my journei in meet an
educ man of my own race
near to our camp wa a stonecov koppi where on the morn after
our arriv i saw six or eight men execut in a wai that i will
not describ their crime accord to mr owen wa that thei had
bewitch some of the king oxen
while i wa recov from thi dread spectacl which fortun
mari did not wit the captain kambula arriv sai that dingaan
wish to see me so take with me the hottentot han and two of the
zulu whom i had hire at delagoa bayfor the royal order were that
none of the other white peopl were to come i wa led through the fenc
of the vast town in which stood two thousand hutsth multitud of
hous as the zulu call itand across a vast open space in the
middl
on the farther side of thi space where befor long i wa fate to
wit a veri tragic scene i enter a kind of labyrinth thi wa
call siklohlo and had high fenc with numer turn so that it
wa imposs to see where on wa go or to find the wai in or out
ultim howev i reach a great hut name intunkulu a word
that mean the hous of hous or the abod of the king in front
of which i saw a fat man seat on a stool nake except for the moocha
about hi middl and necklac and armlet of blue bead two warrior
held their broad shield over hi head to protect him from the sun
otherwis he wa alon although i felt sure that the numer passag
around him were fill with guard for i could hear them move
on enter thi place kambula and hi companion flung themselv upon
their face and began to sing prais of which the king took no notic
present he look up and appear to observ me for the first time
ask
who is that white boi
then kambula rose and said
o king thi is the son of georg whom you command me to captur i
have taken him and the amaboona that is the boer hi companion
and brought them all to you o king
i rememb said dingaan the big boer who wa here and whom
tambusah wa on of dingaan captainslet go against my will
said that he wa a terribl man who should be kill befor he work
great harm to my peopl why did you not kill him kambula although it
is true he doe not look veri terribl
becaus the king word wa that i should bring him to the king
live answer kambula then he ad cheerfulli still if the king
wish it i can kill him at onc
i dont know said dingaan doubtfulli perhap he can mend gun
next after reflect a while he bade a shieldhold to fetch
someon i could not hear whom
doubtless thought i to myself it is the execution and at that
thought a kind of mad rage seiz me why should my life be end thu
in youth to satisfi the whim of a savag and if it must be so why
should i go alon
in the insid pocket of my rag coat i had a small load pistol with
two barrel on of those barrel would kill dingaanat five pace i
could not miss that bulkand the other would blow out my brain for
i wa not mind to have my neck twist or to be beaten to death with
stick well if it wa to be done i had better do it at onc alreadi
my hand wa creep toward the pocket when a new idea or rather two
idea struck me
the first wa that if i shot dingaan the zulu would probabl massacr
mari and the othersmari whose sweet face i should never see again
the second wa that while there is life there is hope perhap after
all he had not sent for an execution but for someon els i would
wait a few minut more of exist were worth the have
the shieldbear return emerg from on of the narrow reedhedg
passag and after him came no execution but a young white man
who as i knew from the look of him wa english he salut the king by
take off hi hat which i rememb wa stuck round with black ostrich
feather then stare at me
o thomaa that is how he pronounc thoma said dingaan tell
me if thi boi is on of your brother or is he a boer
the king want to know if you ar dutch or british said the white
lad speak in english
as british as you ar i answer i wa born in england and come
from the cape
that mai be lucki for you he said becaus the old witchdoctor
zikali ha told him that he must not kill ani english what is your
name mine is thoma halstead i am interpret here
allan quatermain tell zikali whoever he mai be that if he stick to
hi advic i will give him a good present
what ar you talk about ask dingaan suspici
he sai he is english no boer o king that he wa born across the
black water and that he come from the countri out of which all the
boer have trek
at thi intellig dingaan prick up hi ear
then he can tell me about these boer he said and what thei ar
after or could if he were abl to speak my tongu i do not trust you
to interpret you thomaa whom i know to be a liar and he glower
at halstead
i can speak your tongu though not veri well o king i interrupt
and i can tell you all about the boer for i have live among them
ow said dingaan intens interest but perhap you ar also
a liar or ar you a prai man like that fool yonder who is name
oweenah meant the missionari mr owenwhom i spare becaus it
is not lucki to kill on who is mad although he tri to frighten my
soldier with tale of a fire into which thei will go after thei ar
dead as though it matter what happen to them after thei ar dead he
ad reflect take a pinch of snuff
i am no liar i answer what have i to lie about
you would lie to save your own life for all white men ar coward not
like the zulu who love to die for their king but how ar you name
your peopl call me macumazahn
well macumazahn if you ar no liar tell me is it true that these
boer rebel against their king who wa name georg and fled from
him as the traitor umsilikazi did from me
ye i answer that is true
now i am sure that you ar a liar said dingaan triumphantli you sai
that you ar english and therefor serv your king or the inkosikaa
that is the great ladi who thei tell me now sit in hi place how
doe it come about then that you ar travel with a parti of these
veri amaboona who must be your enemi sinc thei ar the enemi of
your king or of her who follow after him
now i knew that i wa in a tight place for on thi matter of loyalti
zulu and inde all nativ idea ar veri primit if i said that i
had sympathi with the boer dingaan would set me down as a traitor if
i said that i hate the boer then still i should be a traitor becaus
i associ with them and a traitor in hi ey would be on to be
kill i do not like to talk religion and anyon who ha read what i
have written in variou work will admit that i have done so rare if
ever yet at that moment i put up a prayer for guidanc feel that
my young life hung upon the answer and it came to mewhenc i do not
know the essenc of that guidanc wa that i should tell the simpl
truth to thi fat savag so i said to him
the answer is thi o king among those boer is a maiden whom i love
and who betroth herself to me sinc we were so high her father took
her north but she sent a messag to me sai that her peopl di
of fever and she starv so i went up in a ship to save her and have
save her and those who remain aliv of her peopl with her
ow said dingaan i understand that reason it is a good reason
howev mani wive he mai have there is no folli that a man will not
commit for the sake of some particular girl who is not yet hi wife
i have done as much myself especi for on who wa call nada the
lili of whom a certain umslopogaa rob me on of my own blood of
whom i am much afraid
see the author book name nada the lili
for a while he brood heavili then went on
your reason is good macumazahn and i accept it more i promis you
thi perhap i shall kill these boer or perhap i shall not kill
them but if i make up my mind to kill them thi girl of your shall be
spare point her out to kambula herenot to thomaa for he is a liar
and would tell me the wrong oneand she shall be spare
i thank you o king i said but what is the us of that if i am to
be kill
i did not sai that you were to be kill macumazahn though perhap i
shall kill you or perhap i shall not kill you it depend upon whether
i find you to be a liar or not a liar now the boer whom tambusa let
go against my wish said that you ar a mighti magician as well as a veri
danger man on who can shoot bird fly on the wing with a bullet
which is imposs can you do so
sometim i answer
veri good macumazahn now we will see if you ar a wizard or a liar
i will make a bet with you yonder by your camp is a hill call hloma
amabutu a hill of stone where evildo ar slain thi afternoon
some wick on die there and when thei ar dead the vultur will
come to devour them now thi is my bet with you when those vultur
come you shall shoot at them and if you kill three out of the first
five on the wingnot on the ground macumazahnthen i will spare these
boer but if you miss them then i shall know that you ar a liar and
no wizard and i will kill them everi on on the hill hloma amabutu i
will spare none of them except the girl whom perhap i will take as a
wife as to you i will not yet sai what i will do with you
now my first impuls wa to refus thi monstrou wager which meant
that the live of a number of peopl were to be set against my skill in
shoot but young thoma halstead guess the word that were about
to break from me said in english
accept unless you ar a fool if you dont he will cut the throat
of everi on of them and stick your girl into the emposeni that is
harem while you will becom a prison as i am
these were word that i could not resent or neglect so although despair
wa in my heart i said coolli
be it so o king i take your wager if i kill three vultur out of
five as thei hover over the hill then i have your promis that all
those who travel with me shall be allow to go henc in safeti
ye ye macumazahn but if you fail to kill them rememb that the
next vultur you shoot at shall be those that come to feed upon their
flesh for then i shall know that you ar no magician but a common
liar and now begon thomaa i will not have you spy on me and
you macumazahn come hither although you talk my tongu so badli i
would speak with you about the boer
so halstead went shrug hi shoulder and mutter as he pass me
i hope you realli can shoot
after he had left i sat alon for a full hour with dingaan while he
crossexamin me about the dutch their movement and their aim in
travel to the confin of hi countri
i answer hi question as best i could try to make out a good case
for them
at length when he grew weari of talk he clap hi hand whereon
a number of fine girl appear two of whom carri pot of beer from
which he offer me drink
i repli that i would have none sinc beer made the hand shake and
that on the steadi of my hand that afternoon depend the live
of mani to do him justic he quit understood the point inde he
order me to be conduct back to the camp at onc that i might rest
and even sent on of hi own attend with me to hold a shield over my
head as i walk so that i should be protect from the sun
hamba gachl that is go softli said the wick old tyrant to me
as i depart under the guidanc of kambula thi afternoon on hour
befor sundown i will meet you at hloma amabutu and there shall be
settl the fate of these amaboona your companion
when i reach the camp it wa to find all the boer cluster togeth
wait for me and with them the reverend mr owen and hi peopl
includ a welsh servant of hi a woman of middl ag who i rememb
wa call jane
well said the vrouw prinsloo and what is your new young man
my new aunt i answer is that on hour befor sundown todai i
have to shoot vultur on the wing against the live of all of you thi
you ow to that falseheart hound hernan pereira who told dingaan
that i am a magician now dingaan would prove it he think that onli
by magic can a man shoot soar vultur with a bullet and as he is
determin to kill you all except perhap mari in the form of a bet
he ha set me a task which he believ to be imposs if i fail the
bet is lost and so ar your live if i succe i think your live will
be spare sinc kambula there tell me that the king alwai make it a
point of honour to pai hi bet now you have the truth and i hope you
like it and i laugh bitterli
when i had finish a perfect storm of execr broke from the boer
if curs could have kill pereira sure he would have di upon the
spot wherev he might be onli two of them were silent mari who
turn veri pale poor girl and her father present on of them
i think it wa meyer round on him vicious and ask him what he

chapter xiii the rehears
by the women wagon we found the liver cook in it fryingpan as
the vrouw had said inde it wa just done to a turn select a
particularli massiv slice she proceed to take it from the pan with
her finger in order to set it upon a piec of tin from which she
had first remov the more evid trace of the morn meal with her
constant companion the ancient and unwashen vatdoek as it chanc the
effort wa not veri success sinc the boil liver fat burnt the
vrouw finger caus her to drop it on the grass and i am sorri to
add to swear as well not to be defeat howev have first suck
her finger to eas their smart she seiz the sizzl liver with the
vatdoek and deposit it upon the dirti tin
there nephew she said triumphantli there ar more wai of kill
a cat than by drown what a fool i wa not to think of the vatdoek
at first allemacht how the flesh ha burnt me i dont suppos that
be kill would hurt much more also if the worst come to the
worst it will soon be over think of it allan by tonight i mai be
an angel dress in a long white nightgown like those my mother gave me
when i wa marri which i cut up for babycloth becaus i found
them chilli wear have alwai been accustom to sleep in my vest
and petticoat ye and i shall have wing too like those on a white
gander onli bigger if thei ar to carri my weight
and a crown of glori i suggest
ye of cours a crown of gloryveri larg sinc i shall be a
martyr but i hope on will onli have to wear it on sundai as i never
could bear anyth heavi on my hair moreov it would remind me of a
kaffir headr done in gold and i shall have had enough of kaffir
then there will be the harp she went on as her imagin took fire
at the prospect of these celesti delight have you ever seen a harp
allan i havent except that which king david carri in the pictur in
the book which look like a broken rimpi chair frame set up edgewai
as for plai the thing thei will have to teach me that all which
will be a difficult busi see that i would sooner listen to cat
on the roof than to music and as for make it
so she chatter on as i believ with the object of divert and
amus me for she wa a shrewd old soul who knew how import it wa
that i should be kept in an equabl frame of mind at thi crisi in our
fate
meanwhil i wa do my best with the lump of liver that tast
painfulli of vatdoek and wa gritti with sand inde when the vrouw
back wa turn i manag to throw the most of it to han behind me who
swallow it at a gulp as a dog doe sinc he did not wish to be caught
chew it
god in heaven how fast you eat nephew said the vrouw catch
sight of my empti tin then ey the voraci hottentot
suspici she ad that yellow dog of your hasnt stolen it ha
he if so ill teach him
no no vrouw answer han in alarm no meat ha pass my lip
thi dai except what i lick out of the pan after breakfast
then allan you will certainli have indigest which is just what i
want to avoid have i not often told you that you should chew your bit
twenti time befor you swallow which i would do myself if i had ani
back teeth left here drink thi milk it is onli a littl sour and
will settl your stomach and she produc a black bottl and subject
it to the attent of the vatdoek grow quit angri when i declin
it and sent for water
next she insist upon my get into her own bed in the wagon to
sleep forbid me to smoke which she said made the hand shake
thither then i went after a brief convers with han whom i
direct to clean my rifl thoroughli for i wish to be alon and
knew that i had littl chanc of solitud outsid of that somewhat fusti
couch
to tell the truth although i shut my ey to deceiv the vrouw who
look in occasion to see how i wa get on no sleep came to
me that afternoonat least not for a long while how could i sleep in
that hot place when my heart wa torn with doubt and terror think of
it reader think of it an hour or two and on my skill would hang the
live of eight white peoplemen women and children and the safeti
or the utter shame of the woman whom i love and who love me no she
should be spare the worst i would give her my pistol and if there
were need she would know what to do
the fear respons wa more than i could bear i fell into a
verit agoni i trembl and even wept a littl then i thought of my
father and what he would do in such circumst and began to prai as
i had never prai befor
i implor the power abov me to give me strength and wisdom not to let
me fail in thi hour of troubl and therebi bring these poor peopl to
a bloodi death i prai till the perspir stream down my face
then suddenli i fell into sleep or swoon i dont know how long i lai
thu but i think it must have been the best part of an hour at last
i woke up all in an instant and as i woke i distinctli heard a tini
voic unlik ani other voic in the whole world speak insid my head
or so it seem to me sai
go to the hill hloma amabutu and watch how the vultur fly do what
come into your mind and even if you seem to fail fear noth
i sat up on the old vrouw bed and felt that some mysteri chang
had come over me i wa no longer the same man my doubt and terror
had gone my hand wa like a rock my heart wa light i knew that i
should kill those three vultur of cours the stori seem absurd and
easi to be explain by the state of my nerv under the strain which
wa be put upon them and for aught i know that mai be it true
mean yet i am not asham to confess that i have alwai held and
still hold otherwis i believ that in my extrem some kindli power
did speak to me in answer to my earnest prayer and to those of other
give me guidanc and what i need still more judgment and calm
at ani rate that thi wa my convict at the moment mai be seen from
the fact that i hasten to obei the teach of that tini unnatur
voic
climb out of the wagon i went to han who wa seat near by in the
full glare of the hot sun at which he seem to stare with unblink
ey
where the rifl han i said
intombi is here baa where i have put her to keep her cool so that
she mai not go off befor it is want and he point to a littl
gravelik heap of gather grass at hi side
the nativ i should explain name thi particular gun intombi
which mean a young girl becaus it wa so much slimmer and more
grace than other gun
is it clean i ask
never wa she cleaner sinc she wa born out of the fire baa also
the powder ha been sift and set to dry in the sun with the cap
and the bullet have been tru to the barrel so that there mai be
no accid when it come to the shoot if you miss the aasvogel
baa it will not be the fault of intombi or of the powder and the
bullet it will be your own fault
that comfort i answer well come on i want to go to the
deathhil yonder
why baa befor the time ask the hottentot shrink back a
littl it is no place to visit till on is oblig these zulu sai
that ghost sit there even in the daylight haunt the rock where
thei were made ghost
vultur sit or fly there also han and i would see how thei fly
that i mai know when and where to shoot at them
that is right baa said the clever hottentot thi is not like
fire at gees in the groot kloof the gees go straight like an
assegai to it mark but the aasvogel wheel round and round alwai on
the turn it is easi to miss a bird that is turn baa
veri easi come on
just as we were start vrouw prinsloo appear from behind the other
wagon and with her mari who i notic wa veri pale and whose
beauti ey were red as though with weep
the vrouw ask me where we were go i told her after consid a
littl she said that wa a good thought of mine as it wa alwai well
to studi the ground befor a battl
i nod and led mari asid behind some thorn tree that grew near
oh allan what will be the end of thi she ask piteous high as
wa her courag it seem to fail her now
a good end dearest i answer we shall come out of thi hole
safe as we have of mani other
how do you know that allan which is known to god alon
becaus god told me mari and i repeat to her the stori of the
voic i had heard in my dream which seem to comfort her
yet yet she exclaim doubtfulli it wa but a dream allan and
dream ar such uncertain thing you mai fail after all
do i look like on who will fail mari
she studi me from head to foot then answer
no you do not although you did when you came back from the king
hut now you ar quit chang still allan you mai fail and
thenwhat some of those dread zulu have been here while you were
sleep bid us all make readi to go to the hill of death thei
sai that dingaan is in earnest if you do not kill the vultur he will
kill us it seem that thei ar sacr bird and if thei escap he will
think he ha noth to fear from the white men and their magic and so
will make a begin by butcher us i mean the rest of us for i am
to be kept aliv and oh what shall i do allan
i look at her and she look at me then i took the doublebarrel
pistol out of my pocket and gave it to her
it is load and on the halfcock i said
she nod and hid it in her dress beneath her apron then without more
word we kiss and part for both of us fear to prolong that scene
the hill hloma amabutu wa quit close to our encamp and the hut of
the reverend mr owen scarc a quarter of a mile off i should sai
rise from the flat veld on the further side of a littl depress
that hardli amount to a vallei as we approach it i notic it
peculiar and blast appear for wherea all around the grass wa
vivid with the green of spring on thi place none seem to grow an
emin strewn with tumbl heap of blackish rock and among them a
few struggl darkleav bush that wa it appear moreov
mani of these boulder look as though thei had been splash and line
with whitewash show that thei were the restingplac of hundr of
gorg vultur
i believ it is the chines who declar that particular local have
good or evil influenc attach to them some kind of spirit of their
own and realli hloma amabutu and a few other spot that i am acquaint
with in africa give colour to the fanci certainli as i set foot upon
that accurs ground that golgotha that place of skull a shiver went
through me it mai have been caus by the atmospher moral and actual
of the mount or it mai have been a prescienc of a certain dread
scene which within a few month i wa doom to wit there or
perhap the place itself and the knowledg of the trial befor me sent
a sudden chill through my healthi blood i cannot sai which it wa but
the fact remain as i have state although a minut or two later when
i saw what kind of sleeper lai upon that mount it would not have been
necessari for me to seek ani farfetch explan of my fear
across thi hill wind in and out between the rough rock that lai
here there and everywher like hailston after a winter storm ran
sundri path it seem that the shortest road to variou place in the
neighbourhood of the great kraal ran over it and although no zulu ever
dare to set foot there between sunset and rise in the daytim thei
us these path freeli enough but i suppos that thei also held
that thi evilomen field of death had some spirit of it own some
invis but immin fiend who need to be propiti lest soon he
should claim them also
thi wa their method of propiti a common on enough i believ
in mani land though what mai be it mean i cannot tell as the
travel came to those spot where the path cut across each other he
took a stone and threw it on to a heap that had been accumul there
by the hand of other travel there were mani such heap upon the
hill over a dozen i think and the size of them wa great i should
sai that the biggest contain quit fifti load of stone and the
smallest not fewer than twenti or thirti
now han although he had never set foot there befor seem to have
learn all the tradit of the place and what rite were necessari
to avert it curs at ani rate when we came to the first heap he cast
a stone upon it and beg me to do the same i laugh and refus
but when we reach the second heap the same thing happen again i
refus whereon befor we came to a third and larger pile han sat
down upon the ground and began to groan swear that he would not go
on step farther unless i promis to make the accustom offer
why not you fool i ask
becaus if you neglect it baa i think that we shall stop here for
ever oh you mai laugh but i tell you that alreadi you have brought
illluck upon yourself rememb my word baa when you miss two of
the five aasvogel
bosh i exclaim or rather it dutch equival still as thi
talk of miss vultur touch me nearli and it is alwai as well
to conform to nativ prejudic at the next and two subsequ heap i
cast my stone as humbl as the most superstiti zulu in the land
by thi time we had reach the summit which mai have been two hundr
yard long it wa hogback in shape with a kind of depress in the
middl clear of stone either by the hand of man or natur and not
unlik a larg circu in it gener conform
oh the sight that met my ey all about lai the pick and scatter
bone of men and women mani of them broken up by the jaw of hyena
some were quit fresh for the hair still clung to the skull other
blanch and old but new or ancient there must have been hundr of
them moreov on the side of the hill it wa the same stori though
there for the most part the bone had been gather into gleam
heap no wonder that the vultur love hloma amabutu the place of
slaughter of the bloodi zulu king
of these horribl bird howev at the moment not on wa to be seen
as there had been no execut for a few hour thei were seek their
food elsewher now for my own purpos i want to see them sinc
otherwis my visit wa in vain and present bethought myself of a
method of secur their arriv
han i said i am go to pretend to kill you and then you must
lie quit still out there like on dead even if the aasvogel settl
on you you must lie quit still so that i mai see whenc thei come and
how thei settl
the hottentot did not take at all kindli to thi suggest inde he
flatli refus to obei me give sundri good reason he said that
thi kind of rehears wa illomen that come event have a wai of
cast their shadow befor and he did not wish to furnish the event
he said that the zulu declar that the sacr aasvogel of hloma
amabutu were as savag as lion and that when onc thei saw a man down
thei would tear him to piec dead or live in short han and i came
to an acut differ of opinion as for everi reason it wa necessari
that my view should prevail howev i did not hesit to put matter
to him veri plainli
han i said you have to be a bait for vultur choos if you will
be a live bait or a dead bait and i cock the rifl significantli
although in truth the last thing that i wish or intend to do wa
to shoot my faith old hottentot friend but han know all i had
at stake came to a differ conclus
allemacht baa he said i understand and i do not blame you
well if i obei aliv perhap my guardian snake or spirit will
protect me from the evil omen and perhap the aasvogel will not pick
out my ey but if onc you send a bullet through my stomachwhi then
everyth is finish and for han it is good night sleep well i
will obei you baa and lie where you wish onli i prai you do not
forget me and go awai leav me with those devil bird
i promis him faithfulli that i would not then we went through a veri
grim littl pantomim proceed to the centr of the arenalik space
i lift the gun and appear to dash out han brain with it butt
he fell upon hi back kick about a littl and lai still thi
finish act 1
act 2 wa that caper like a brute of a zulu execution i retir
from my victim and hid myself in a bush on the edg of the plateau at
a distanc of forti yard after thi there wa a paus the place wa
intens bright with sunshin and intens silent as silent as the
skeleton of the murder men about me as silent as han who lai there
look so veri small and dead in that big theatr where no grass grew
it wa an eeri wait in such surround but at length the curtain
rang up for act 3
in the infinit arch of blue abov me i perceiv a speck no larger
than a mote of dust the aasvogel on watch up there far out of the rang
of man vision had seen the deed and by sink downward signal
it to hi companion that were quarter the sky for fifti mile round
for these bird prei by sight not by smell down he came and down
and long befor he had reach the neighbourhood of earth other speck
appear in the distant blue now he wa not more than four or five
hundr yard abov me and began to wheel float round the place
upon hi wide wing and sink as he wheel so he sank softli and
slowli until he wa about a hundr and fifti feet abov han then
suddenli he paus hung quit steadi for a few second shut hi wing
and fell like a bolt onli open them again just befor he reach the
earth
here he settl tilt forward in that odd wai which vultur have
and scrambl a few awkward pace until he gain hi balanc then
he froze into immobl gaze with in aw stoni glare at the
prostrat han who lai within about fifteen feet of him scarc wa
thi aasvogel down when other summon from the depth of sky did as
he had done thei appear thei sank thei wheel alwai from east to
west the wai the sun travel thei hover for a few second then fell
like stone pitch on to their beak recov themselv waddl
forward into line and sat gaze at han soon there wa a great ring
of them about him all immov all gaze all wait for someth
present that someth appear in the shape of an aasvogel which wa
nearli twice as big as ani of the other thi wa what the boer and
the nativ call the king vultur on of which goe with everi flock
he it is who rule the roost and also the carcas which without hi
presenc and permiss none dare to attack whether thi vile fowl is
of a differ speci from the other or whether he is a bird of more
vigor growth and constitut that ha outgrown the rest and thu
becom their overlord is more than i can tell at least it is certain
as i can testifi from long and constant observ that almost everi
flock of vultur ha it king
when thi particular royalti had arriv the other aasvogel of which
perhap there were now fifti or sixti gather round han began to show
sign of interest anim thei look at the king bird thei
look at han stretch out their nake red neck and wink their
brilliant ey i howev did not pai particular attent to those
upon the earth be ampli occupi in watch their fellow in the
air
with delight i observ that the vultur is a veri conserv
creatur thei all did what doubtless thei have done sinc the dai of
adam or earlierwheel and then hung that littl space of time befor
thei drop to the ground like lead thi then would be the moment
at which to shoot them when for four or five second thei offer
practic a sit target now at that distanc alwai under a
hundr yard i knew well that i could hit a tea plate everi shot
and a vultur is much larger than a tea plate so it seem to me that
bar accid i had littl to fear from the terribl trial of skill
which lai befor me again and again i cover the hover bird
with my rifl feel that if i had press the trigger i should have
pierc them through
think it well to practis i continu thi game for a long while
till at last it came to an unexpect end suddenli i heard a scuffl
sound drop my glanc i saw that the whole mob of aasvogel were
rush in upon han help themselv forward by flap their great
wing and that about three feet in front of them wa their king next
instant han vanish and from the centr of that fluffi stink mass
there aros a fright yell
as a matter of fact as i found afterward the king vultur had
fasten on to hi snub nose whilst it dread companion have
seiz other portion of hi frame were begin to hang back after
their fashion in order to secur some chosen morsel han kick and
scream and i rush in shout caus them to rise in a great
flap cloud that present vanish thi wai and that within a
minut thei had all gone and the hottentot and i were left alon
that is good i said you plai well
good baa he answer and i with two cut in my nose in which i
can lai my finger and bite all over me look how my trouser ar torn
look at my headwher is the hair look at my nose good plai well
it is those verdomd aasvogel that plai oh baa if you had seen
and smelt them you would not sai that it wa good see on more second
and i who have two nostril should have had four
never mind han i said it is onli a scratch and i will make you a
present of some new trouser also here is tobacco for you come to the
bush let us talk
so we went and when han wa a littl compos i told him all that i
had observ about the habit of the aasvogel in the air and he told me
all that he had observ about their habit on the ground which as i
might not shoot them sit did not interest me still he agre with
me that the right moment to fire would be just befor thei pounc
whilst we were still talk we heard a sound of shout and look
over the brow of the hill that face toward umgungundhlovu we saw
a melancholi sight be driven up the slope toward us by three
execution and a guard of seven or eight soldier their hand ti
behind their back were three men on veri old on of about fifti
year of ag and on a lad who did not look more than eighteen as i
soon heard thei were of a singl famili the grandfath the father
and the eldest son who had been seiz upon some ridicul charg of
witchcraft but realli in order that the king might take their cattl
have been tri and condemn by the nyanga or witchdoctor these
poor wretch were now doom to die inde not content with thu
destroi the head of the tribe present and to come for three
gener all their descend and collater had alreadi been
wipe out by dingaan so that he might pose as sole heir to the famili
cattl
such were the dread cruelti that happen in zululand in those
dai
chapter xiv the plai
the doom three were driven by their murder into the centr of the
depress within a few yard of which han and i were stand
after them came the head execution a great brute who wore a curious
shape leopardskin capi suppos as a badg of officeand held in
hi hand a heavi kerri the shaft of which wa score with mani notch
each of them repres a human life
see white man he shout here is the bait which the king send to
draw the holi bird to you had it not been that you need such bait
perhap these wizard would have escap but the black on said the
littl son of georg who is name macumazahn need them that he mai
show hi magic and therefor thei must die todai
now at thi inform i turn posit sick nor did it make me
feel better when the youngest of the victim hear the execution
word flung himself upon hi knee and began to implor me to spare
him hi grandfath also address me sai
chief will it not be enough if i die i am old and my life doe not
matter or if on is not suffici take me and my son and let the
lad my grandson go free we ar all of us innoc of ani witchcraft

unmarri boi chief you also ar young would not your heart be

the sky think white chief what your father would feel if you have
on should he be forc to see you kill befor hi ey that some
stranger might us your bodi to show hi skill with a magic weapon by
slai the wild thing that would eat it
now almost with tear i broke in explain to the vener man as
well as i could that their horribl fate had noth to do with me i
told him that i wa innoc of their blood who wa forc to be
there to try to shoot vultur on the wing in order to save my white
companion from a doom similar to their own he listen attent
ask a question now and again and when he had master my mean
said with a most dignifi calm
now i understand white man and am glad to learn that you ar not
cruel as i thought my children he ad turn to the other let
us troubl thi inkoo no more he onli doe what he must do to save the
live of hi brethren by hi skill if he can if we continu to plead

alwai done white lord we thank you for your good word mai you live
long and mai good fortun sleep in your hut to the end mai you shoot
straight also with your magic tool and therebi win the live of your
compani out of the hand of the king farewel inkoo and sinc he
could not lift hi bound hand in salut he bow to me as did the
other
then thei walk to a littl distanc and seat themselv on the
ground began to talk togeth and after a while to drone some strang
chant in unison the execution and the guard also sat down not far
awai laugh chat and pass a horn of snuff from hand to hand
inde i observ that the captain of them even took some snuff to the
victim and held it in hi palm beneath their nose while thei drew it
up their nostril and polit thank him between the sneez
as for myself i lit a pipe and smoke it for i seem to requir a
stimul or rather a sed befor it wa finish han who wa
engag in doctor hi scratch made by the vultur beak with a
concoct of leav which he had been chew exclaim suddenli in
hi matteroffact voic
see baa here thei come the white peopl on on side and the black
on the other just like the goat and the sheep at judgment dai in the
book
i look and there to my right appear the parti of boer head by
the vrouw prinsloo who held the remnant of an old umbrella over her
head to the left advanc a number of zulu nobl and councillor in
front of whom waddl dingaan arrai in hi bead danc dress he wa
support by two stalwart bodyserv whilst a third held a shield
over hi head to protect him from the sun and a fourth carri a larg
stool upon which he wa to sit behind each parti also i perceiv
a number of zulu in their wardress all of them arm with broad
stab spear
the two parti arriv at the stone upon which i wa sit almost
simultan as probabl it had been arrang that thei should do
and halt stare at each other as for me i sat still upon my stone
and smoke on
allemacht allan puf the vrouw prinsloo who wa breathless with
her walk up the hill so here you ar as you did not come back i
thought you had run awai and left us like that stinkcat pereira
ye tant aunt here i am i answer gloomili and i wish to
heaven that i wa somewher els
just then dingaan have settl hi great bulk upon the stool and
recov hi breath call to the lad halstead who wa with him and
said
o thomaa ask your brother macumazahn if he is readi to try to
shoot the vultur if not as i wish to be fair i will give him a
littl more time to make hi magic medicin
i repli sulkili that i wa as readi as i wa ever like to be
then the vrouw prinsloo understand that the king of the zulu wa
befor her advanc upon him wave her umbrella catch hold of
halstead who understood dutch she forc him to translat an harangu
which she address to dingaan
had he render it exactli as it came from her lip we should all have
been dead in five minut but luckili that unfortun young man had
learnt some of the guil of the serpent dure hi sojourn among the
zulu and vari her vigor phrase the gist of her discours wa
that he dingaan wa a blackheart and bloodymind villain with
whom the almighti would come even sooner or later as inde he did
and that if he dare to touch on hair of her or of her companion
head the boer her countrymen would prove themselv to be the
minist of the almighti in that matter as inde thei did as
translat by halstead into zulu what she said wa that dingaan wa the
greatest king in the whole world in fact that there wa not and never
had been ani such a king either in power wisdom or person beauti
and that if she and her companion had to die the sight of hi glori
consol them for their death
inde said dingaan suspici if that is what thi manwoman
sai her ey tell on stori and her lip anoth oh thomaa lie no
more speak the true word of the white chieftai lest i should find
them out otherwis and give you to the slayer
thu adjur halstead explain that he had not yet told all the word

see that her poor old hand wa shake and she wa wipe her ey with
the vatdoek henri marai also in broken tone implor me to shoot
straight for hi daughter sake then came mari pale but resolut
who said noth but onli look me in the ey and touch the pocket
of her dress in which i knew the pistol lai hid of the rest of them i
took no notic
the moment that dread moment of trial had come at last and oh the
suspens and the wait were hard to bear it seem an ag befor the
first speck that i knew to be a vultur appear thousand of feet
abov me and began to descend in wide circl
oh baa said poor han thi is wors than shoot at the gees in
the groot kloof then you could onli lose your hors but now
be silent i hiss and give me the rifl

boer and saw that thei were all of them on their knee i glanc
toward the zulu and saw that thei were watch as i think thei had
never watch anyth befor for to them thi wa a new excit
then i fix my ey upon the bird

outstretch wing as the other had done it head toward me i drew
a deep breath lift the rifl got the foresight dead upon it breast
and touch the hairtrigg as the charg explod i saw the aasvogel
give a kind of backward twist next instant i heard a loud clap and a
surg of joi went through me for i thought that the bullet had found
it billet but ala it wa not so
the clap wa that of the air disturb by the pass of the ball and
the strike of thi air against the stiff feather of the wing anyon
who ha shot at great bird on the wing with a bullet will be acquaint
with the sound instead of fall the vultur recov itself not
know the mean of thi unaccustom nois it drop quietli to
earth and sat down near the bodi pitch forward in the natur
wai and run a few pace as the other had done that afternoon
evid it wa quit unhurt
miss gasp han as he grasp the rifl to load it oh why did
you not throw a stone on to the first heap
i gave han a look that must have frighten him at ani rate he spoke
no more from the boer went up a low groan then thei began to prai
harder than ever while the zulu cluster round the king and whisper
to him i learn afterward that he wa give heavi odd against
me ten to on in cattl which thei were oblig to take unwillingli
enough
han finish load cap and cock the rifl and hand it to me
by now other vultur were appear be desper anxiou to get
the thing over on wai or anoth at the proper moment i took the first
of them again i cover it dead and press again as the gun explod
i saw that backward lurch of the bird and heard the clap of the air
upon it wing thenoh horrorthi aasvogel turn quietli and
began to mount the ladder of the sky in the same fashion as it had
descend i had miss onc more
the second heap of stone ha done thi baa said han faintli and
thi time i did not even look him i onli sat down and buri my face in
my hand on more such miss and then
han began to whisper to me
baa he said those aasvogel see the flash of the gun and shy at
it like a hors baa you ar shoot into their face for thei all
hang with their beak toward you befor thei drop you must get behind
them and fire into their tail for even an aasvogel cannot see with
it tail
i let fall my hand and stare at him sure the poor fellow had been
inspir from on high i understood it all now while their beak were
toward me i might fire at fifti vultur and never hit on for each
time thei would swerv from the flash caus the bullet to miss them
though but by a littl
come i gasp and began to walk quickli round the edg of the
depress to a rock which i saw opposit about a hundr yard awai
my journei took me near the zulu who mock me as i pass ask
where my magic wa and if i wish to see the white peopl kill
present dingaan wa now offer odd of fifti cattl to on against
me but no on would take the bet even with the king
i made no answer no not even when thei ask me if i had thrown down
my spear and wa run awai grimli despairingli i march on to
the rock and took shelter behind it with han the boer i saw were
still upon their knee but seem to have ceas prai the children
were weep the men stare at each other vrouw prinsloo had her arm
about mari waist wait there behind the rock my courag return
to me as it sometim doe in the last extrem i rememb my dream
and took comfort sure god would not be so cruel as to suffer me to
fail and therebi bring all those poor peopl to their death
snatch the rifl from han i load it myself noth must be
trust to anoth as i put on the cap a vultur made it last circl
it hung in the air just as the other had done and oh it tail wa
toward me i lift i aim between the gatheredup leg i press
and shut my ey for i did not dare to look
i heard the bullet strike or seem to strike and a few second later
i heard someth elseth nois of a heavi thud upon the ground i
look and there with outstretch wing lai the foul bird dead stone
dead eight or ten pace from the bodi
allemacht that better said han you threw stone on to all
the other heap didnt you baa
the zulu grew excit and the odd went down a littl the boer
stretch out their white face and stare at me i saw them out of the
corner of my ey as i load again anoth vultur came see on
of it companion on the ground if in a somewhat unnatur attitud
perhap it thought that there could be noth to fear i lean against
my rock aim and fire almost carelessli so sure wa i of the
result thi time i did not shut my ey but watch to see what
happen
the bullet struck the bird between it thigh rake it from end to end
and down it came like a stone almost upon the top of it fellow
good good said han with a guttur chuckl of delight now baa
make no mistak with the third and al sall recht kommen all shall
be well
ye i answer if i make no mistak with the third
i load the rifl again myself be veri care to ram down the
powder well and to select a bullet that fit perfectli true to the
bore moreov i clear the nippl with a thorn and shook a littl
fine powder into it so as to obviat ani chanc of a missfir then
i set on the cap and wait what wa go on among the boer or
the zulu i do not know in thi last crisi of all our fate i never
look be too intent upon my own part in the drama
by now the vultur appear to have realis that someth unusu wa
in progress which threaten danger to them at ani rate although by
thi time thei had collect in hundr from east west north and
south and were wheel the heaven abov in their vast majest
circl none of them seem to care to descend to prei upon the bodi
i watch and saw that among their number wa that great king bird
which had bitten han in the face it wa easi to distinguish him
becaus he wa so much larger than the other also he had some white
at the tip of hi wing i observ that certain of hi compani drew
near to him in the ski where thei hung togeth in a knot as though
in consult
thei separ out again and the king began to descend deput
probabl to spy out the land down he came in evernarrow turn
till he reach the appoint spot for the plung and accord to the
immemori custom of these bird hung a while befor he pounc with
hi head to the south and hi great spread tail toward me
thi wa my chanc and rejoic in have so larg a mark i got the
sight upon him and pull the bullet thud some feather float
from hi belli show that it had gone home and i look to see
him fall as the other had done but ala he did not fall for a few
second he rock to and fro upon hi great wing then commenc to
travel upward in vast circl which grew gradual more narrow till
he appear to be fly almost straight into the empyrean i stare and
stare everybodi stare till that enorm bird becam first a
mere blot upon the blue and at length but a speck then it vanish
altogeth into region far beyond the sight of man
now there is an end i said to han
ja baa answer the hottentot between hi chatter teeth there
is an end you did not put in enough powder present we shall all be
dead
not quit i said with a bitter laugh han load the rifl load it
quick befor thei die there shall be anoth king in zululand
good good he exclaim as he load desper let us take that
fat pig of a dingaan with us shoot him in the stomach baa shoot him
in the stomach so that he too mai learn what it is to die slowli then
cut my throat here is my big knife and afterward cut your own if
you have not time to load the gun again and shoot yourself which is
easier
i nod for it wa in my mind to do these thing never could i stand
still and see those poor boer kill and i knew that mari would look
after herself
meanwhil the zulu were come toward me and the soldier who had
charg of them were drive up maraiss peopl make pretenc to
thrust them through with their assegai and shout at them as men
do at cattl both parti arriv in the depress at about the same
time but remain separ by a littl space in thi space lai the
corps of the murder men and the two dead aasvogel with han and
myself stand opposit to them
well littl son of georg puf dingaan you have lost your bet
for you did but kill two vultur out of five with your magic which
wa good as far as it went but not good enough now you must pai as i
would have paid had you won
then he stretch out hi hand and issu the dread order of bulala
amalongu kill the white peopl kill them on by on that i mai
see whether thei know how to die all except macumazahn and the tall
girl whom i keep
some of the soldier made a dash and seiz the vrouw prinsloo who wa
stand in front of the parti
wait a littl king she call out as the assegai were lift over
her how do you know that the bet is lost he whom you call macumazahn
hit that last vultur it should be search for befor you kill us
what doe the old woman sai ask dingaan and halstead translat
slowli
true said dingaan well now i will send her to search for the
vultur in the sky come back thenc fat on and tell us if you find
it
the soldier lift their assegai wait the king word i pretend
to look at the ground and cock my rifl be determin that if he
spoke it it should be hi last han stare upwardsi suppos to avoid
the sight of deaththen suddenli utter a wild yell which caus
everyon even the doom peopl to turn their ey to him he wa
point to the heaven and thei look to see at what he point
thi wa what thei saw far far abov in that infinit sea of
blue there appear a tini speck which hi sharp sight had alreadi
discern a speck that grew larger and larger as it descend with
terrif and evergrow speed
it wa the king vultur fall from the heavensdead
down it came between the vrouw prinsloo and the slayer smash the
lift assegai of on of them and hurl him to the earth down it
came and lai there a mere mass of pulp and feather
o dingaan i said in the midst of the intens silenc that follow
it seem that it is i who have won the bet not you i kill thi king
of bird but be a king it chose to die high up and alon that is
all
dingaan hesit for he did not wish to spare the boer and i note
hi hesit lift my rifl a littl perhap he saw it or perhap
hi sens of honour as he understood the word overcam hi wish for
their blood at ani rate he said to on of hi councillor
search the carcas of that vultur and see if there is a bullet hole in
it
the man obei feel at the mass of broken bone and flesh by
good fortun he found not the hole for that wa lost in the gener
destruct of the tissu but the ball itself which have pierc
the thick bodi from below upward had remain fast in the tough skin
just by the backbon where the long red neck emerg from between the
wing he pick it out for it wa onli hang in the skin and held
it up for all to see
macumazahn ha won hi bet said dingaan hi magic ha conquer
though by but a veri littl macumazahn take these boer thei ar
your and begon with them out of my countri
chapter xv retief ask a favour
now and again dure our troubl journei through life we reach littl
oas of almost perfect happi set jewellik here and there in
the thorni wilder of time sometim these ar hour of mere anim
content in other thei ar made beauti by water blow from our
spiritu spring of be as in those rare instanc when the materi
veil of life seem to be rent by a mighti hand and we feel the presenc
and the comfort of god within us and about us guid our footstep to
the ineff end which is himself occasion howev all these
physic satisfact and love divin and human ar blend to a whole
like soul and bodi and we can sai now i know what is joi
such an hour came to me on the even of that dai of the win of my
bet with dingaan when a dozen live or so were set against my nerv and
skill these had not fail me although i knew that had it not been
for the inspir of the hottentot han who sent it i wonder
thei would have been of no servic at all with all my thought and
experi it had never occur to me that the wonder ey of the
vultur would see the flash of the powder even through the pervad
sunlight and swerv befor the deadli bullet could reach them
on that night i wa inde a hero in a small wai even henri marai
thaw and spoke to me as a father might to hi child he who alwai
dislik me in secret partli becaus i wa an englishman partli
becaus i wa everyth to hi daughter and he wa jealou and partli
for the reason that i stood in the path of hi nephew hernan pereira
whom he either love or fear or both as for the rest of them men
women and children thei thank and bless me with tear in their
ey vow that young as i wa thenceforth i and no other should be
their leader as mai be imagin although it is true that she set down
my success to her meal of bullock liver and the nap which she had
insist on my take the vrouw prinsloo wa the most enthusiast of
them all
look at him she said point with her fat finger at my
insignific self and address her famili if onli i had such a
husband or a son instead of you lump that god ha ti to me like
clog to the heel of a sheass i should be happi
god did that in order to prevent you from kick old vrouw said
her husband a quiet man with a vein of sardon humour if onli he had
ti anoth clog to your tongu i should be happi also whereon the
vrouw smack hi head and her children got out of the wai snigger
but the most bless thing of all wa my interview with mari all that
took place between us can best be left to the imagin sinc the
talk of lover even in such circumst is not interest to
other also in a sens it is too sacr to repeat on sentenc i
will set down howev becaus in the light of after event i feel that
it wa prophet and not spoken mere by chanc it wa at the end of
our talk as she wa hand me back the pistol that i had given her for
a certain dread purpos
three time you have save my life allanonc at maraisfontein onc
from starvat and now from dingaan whose touch would have meant my
death i wonder whether it will ever be my turn to save your
she look down for a littl while then lift her head and laid her
hand upon my shoulder ad slowli do you know allan i think that
it will at the and suddenli she turn and left me with her sentenc
unfinish
so thu it came about that by the help of provid i wa enabl to
rescu all these worthi folk from a miser and a bloodi death and
yet i have often reflect sinc that if thing had gone differ
if for instanc that king aasvogel had found strength to carri itself
awai to die at a distanc instead of soar straight upward like
a tower partridg as bird injur in the lung will often doi
suppos in search of airit might have been better in the end then
i should certainli have shot dingaan dead and everi on of us would as
certainli have been kill on the spot but if dingaan had di that
dai retief and hi companion would never have been massacr also as
the peac panda hi brother would i suppos have succeed to the
throne probabl the subsequ slaughter at weenen and all the after
fight would never have taken place but so it wa fate and who
am i that i should quarrel with or even question the decre of fate
doubtless these thing were doom to happen and thei happen in due
cours there is noth more to be said
earli on the follow morn we collect our oxen which although
still footsor were now full fed and somewhat rest an hour or two
later began our trek word have come to us from dingaan that we must
start at onc also he sent us guid under the command of the captain
kambula to show us the road to natal
i breakfast that dai with the reverend mr owen and hi peopl my
object be to persuad him to come awai with us as i did not consid
that zululand wa a safe place for white women and children my mission
prove fruitless mr hullei the wife of the absent interpret who
had three littl on miss owen and the servant jane william were
all of them anxiou enough to do as i suggest but mr and mr owen
who were fill with the true fervour of missionari would not listen
thei said that god would protect them that thei had onli been a few
week in the countri and that it would be the act of coward and of
traitor to fly at the veri begin of their work here i mai add that
after the massacr of retief thei chang their opinion small blame to
them and fled as fast as anyon els
i told mr owen how veri close i had gone to shoot dingaan in which
event thei might all have been kill with us thi new shock him
much inde he lectur me sever on the sin of bloodthirsti
and a desir for reveng so find that we look at thing
differ and that it wa of no us wast breath in argument i
wish him and hi peopl goodby and good fortun and went upon my
wai littl guess how we should meet again
an hour later we trek pass by the accurs hill hloma amabutu
where i saw some gorg vultur sleep on the rock we came to the
gate of the great kraal here to my surpris i saw dingaan with some
of hi councillor and an arm guard of over a hundr men seat
under the shade of two big milk tree fear treacheri i halt the
wagon and advis the boer to load their rifl and be readi for the
worst a minut or so later young thoma halstead arriv and told me
that dingaan wish to speak with us i ask him if that meant that we
were to be kill he answer no you ar quit safe the king had
receiv some new that had put him in a good humour with the white
peopl and he desir to bid us farewel that wa all
so we trek boldli to where dingaan wa and stop the wagon
went up to him in a bodi he greet us kindli enough and even gave me
hi fat hand to shake
macumazahn he said although it ha cost me mani oxen i am glad
that your magic prevail yesterdai had it not done so i should have
kill all these your friend which would have been a caus of war
between me and the amaboona now thi morn i have learn that these
amaboona ar send a friendli embassi to me under on of their great
chief and i think that you will meet them on the road i charg you
therefor to tell them to come on have no fear as i will receiv
them well and listen to all thei have to sai
i answer that i would do so
good he repli i am send twelv head of cattl with you six
of them for your food dure your journei and six as a present to the
embassi of the amaboona also kambula my captain ha charg to see you
safe over the tugela river
i thank him and turn to go when suddenli hi ey fell upon mari
who foolishli enough took thi opportun to advanc from among the
other and speak to me about somethingi forget what
macumazahn is that the maiden of whom you spoke to me ask dingaan
she whom you ar go to marri
i answer ye
by the head of the black on he exclaim she is veri fair will
you not make a present of her to me macumazahn
i answer no she is not mine to give awai
well then macumazahn i will pai you a hundr head of cattl for
her which is the price of a royal wife and give you ten of the fairest
girl in zululand in exchang
i answer that it could not be
now the king began to grow angri
i will keep her whether you wish it or no he said
then you will keep her dead o dingaan i repli for there is more
of that magic which slew the vultur
of cours i meant that mari would be dead but as my knowledg of the
zulu tongu wa imperfect he understood the word to mean that he
would be dead and i think thei frighten him at ani rate he said
well i promis you all safeconduct if you won your bet so hamba
gachl go in peac i wish to have no quarrel with the white folk
but macumazahn you ar the first of them who ha refus a gift to
dingaan still i bear you no grudg and if you choos to come back
again you will be welcom for i perceiv that although so small you
ar veri clever and have a will of your own also that you mean what you
sai and speak the truth tell the peopl of georg that my heart is soft
toward them then he turn and walk awai through the gate of the
kraal
glad enough wa i to see the last of him for now i knew that we were
safe except from such accid as mai overtak ani travel through
a wild countri for the present at ani rate until after he had seen
thi embassi dingaan wish to stand well with the boer therefor it
wa obviou that he would never make an irrepar quarrel with them
by treacher put us to death as we trek through hi countri
be sure of thi we went on our wai with light heart thank
heaven for the merci which had been shown to us
it wa on the third dai of our trek when we were draw near to the
tugela that we met the boer embassi offsaddl by a littl stream
where we propos to outspan to rest the oxen while we at our middai
meal thei were sleep in the heat of the dai and saw noth of us
till we were right on to them when catch sight of our zulu advanc
guard thei sprang up and ran for their rifl then the wagon emerg

cross these hill on the further side of them as retief had told us
we should do we found a larg parti of the trekboer who were alreadi
occupi thi land on the hither side of the bushman river littl
know poor peopl that it wa fate to becom the grave of mani
of them todai and for all futur time that district is and will be
known by the name of weenen or the place of weep becaus of those
pioneer who here were massacr by dingaan within a few week of the
time of which i write
nice as the land wa for some reason or other it did not quit suit
my fanci and therefor in view of my approach marriag with mari
have purchas a hors from on of the trekboer i began to explor
the countri round my object wa to find a stretch of fertil veld where
we could settl when we were wed and such a spot i discov after
some troubl it lai about thirti mile awai to the east in the loop of
a beauti stream that is now known as the mooi river
enclos in thi loop were some thirti thousand acr of veri rich
lowli soil almost treeless and cloth with luxuri grass where
game wa extraordinarili numer at the head of it rose a flattop
hill from the crest of which oddli enough flow a plenti stream
of water fed by a strong spring halfwai down thi hill face to
the east and irrig by the stream wa a plateau sever acr in
extent which furnish about the best site for a hous that i know in
all south africa here i determin we would build our dwellingplac
and becom rich by the breed up of great herd of cattl i should
explain that thi ground which onc as the remain of their old kraal
show had belong to a kaffir tribe kill out by chaka the zulu
king wa to be had for the take
inde as there wa more land than we could possibl occupi i
persuad henri marai the prinsloo and the meyer with whom i had
trek from delagoa to visit it with me when thei had seen it thei
agre to make it their home in the futur but meanwhil elect to
return to the other boer for safeti sake so with the help of some
kaffir of whom there were a few in the district remnant of those
tribe which chaka had destroi i peg out an estat of about twelv
thousand acr for myself and select a site set the nativ to
work to build a rough mud hous upon it which would serv as a temporari
dwell i should add that the prinsloo and the meyer also made
arrang for the build of similar shelter almost alongsid of my
own thi done i return to mari and the trekboer
on the morn after my return to the camp piet retief appear there
with hi five or six companion i ask him how he had got on with
dingaan
well enough nephew he answer at first the king wa somewhat
angri sai that we boer had stolen six hundr head of hi cattl
but i show him that it wa the chief sikonyela who live yonder on
the caledon river who had dress up hi peopl in white men cloth
and put them upon hors and afterward drove the cattl through on of
our camp to make it appear that we were the thiev then he ask me
what wa my object in visit him i answer that i sought a grant of
the land south of the tugela to the sea
bring me back the cattl that you sai sikonyela ha stolen he said
and we will talk about thi land to thi i agre and soon after left
the kraal
what did you do with hernan pereira uncl i ask
thi allan when i wa at umgungundhlovu i sought out the truth of
that stori you told me as to hi have made a plot to get you kill by
the zulu on the ground that you were a wizard
and what did you discov uncl
i discov that it wa true for dingaan told me so himself then i
sent for pereira and order him out of my camp tell him that if
he came back among the boer i would have him put on hi trial for
attempt murder he said noth but went awai
whither did he go
to a place that dingaan gave him just outsid hi kraal the king said
that he would be us to him as he could mend gun and teach hi
soldier to shoot with them so there i suppos he remain unless he
ha thought it wiser to make off at ani rate i am sure that he will
not come here to troubl you or anyon
no uncl but he mai troubl you there i said doubtfulli
what do you mean allan
i dont quit know but he is blackheart a traitor by natur and
in on wai or the other he will stir up sorrow do you think that
he will love you for instanc after you have hunt him out like a
thief
retief shrug hi shoulder and laugh as he answer
i will take my chanc of that what is the us of troubl on head
about such a snake of a man and now allan i have someth to ask
you ar you marri yet
no uncl nor can be for anoth five week when mari come of ag
her father still hold that hi oath bind him and i have promis that

a snake doe a bird still i suppos that he ha the law on hi side
and as i am command i cannot advis anyon to break the law now
listen it is no us your stai here look at the ripe peach you
mai not pluck for that onli make the stomach sick therefor the
best thing that you can do is to come with me to get those cattl from
sikonyela for i shall be veri glad of your compani afterward too
i want you to return with me to zululand when i go for the grant of all
thi countri
but how about my get marri i ask in dismai

must be when we return listen now do not disappoint me in thi matter
allan none of us can speak zulu except you who take to these savag
languag like a duck to water and i want you to be my interpret with
dingaan also the king special ask that you should come with me when
i brought the cattl as he seem to have taken a great fanci to you he
said that you would render hi word honestli but that he did not trust
the lad whom he ha there to translat into dutch and english so you
see it will help me veri much in thi big busi if you come with me
still i hesit for some fear of the futur lai heavi on my heart
warn me against thi expedit
allemacht said retief angrili if you will not grant me a favour
let it be or is it that you want reward if so all i can promis you
is twenti thousand acr of the best land in the countri when we get
it
no mynheer retief i repli it is no question of reward and as
for the land i have alreadi peg out my farm on a river about thirti
mile to the east it is that i do not like to leav mari alon
fear lest her father should plai some trick on me as regard her and
hernan pereira
oh if that is all you ar afraid of allan i can soon settl matter
for i will give order to the prdicant cellier that he is not to marri
mari marai to anyon except yourself even if she ask him also i
will order that if hernan pereira should come to the camp he is to be
shut up until i return to try him lastli as command i will name
henri marai as on of those who ar to accompani us so that he will be
abl to plot noth against you now ar you satisfi
i said ye as cheerfulli as i could though i felt anyth but
cheer and we part for of cours the command retief had much
to occupi him
then i went and told mari what i had promis somewhat to my surpris
she said that she thought i had act wise
if you stai here she ad perhap some new quarrel would aris
between you and my father which might make bitter afterward also
dear it would be foolish for you to offend the command retief who
will be the great man in thi countri and who is veri fond of you
after all allan we shall onli be separ for a littl while and
when that is done we have the rest of our live to spend togeth as
for me do not be afraid for you know i will never marri anyon but
youno not to save myself from death
so i left her somewhat comfort know how sound wa her judgment
and went off to make my prepar for the expedit to sikonyela
countri
all thi convers with retief i have set down in full as nearli as
i can rememb it becaus of it fate consequ ah if i could
have foreseen if onli i could have foreseen
chapter xvi the council
two dai later we start to recov dingaan cattl sixti or seventi
of us all well arm and mount with us went two of dingaan
captain and a number of zulu perhap a hundr who were to drive the
cattl if we recov them as i could speak their languag i wa more
or less in command of thi zulu conting and manag to make myself
veri us in that capac also dure the month or so of our
absenc by continu convers with them i perfect myself
consider in my knowledg of their beauti but difficult tongu
now it is not my intent to write down the detail of thi expedit
dure which there wa no fight and noth seriou happen we
arriv in due cours at sikonyela and state our errand when he
saw how numer and well arm we were and that behind us wa all
the might of the zulu armi that wili old rascal thought it well to
surrend the stolen cattl without further todo and with these some
hors which he had lift from the boer so have receiv them
we deliv them over to the zulu captain with instruct to drive
them carefulli to umgungundhlovu the command sent a messag by these
men to the effect that have fulfil hi part of the compact he
would wait upon dingaan as soon as possibl in order to conclud the
treati about the land
thi busi finish retief took me and a number of the boer
to visit other bodi of the emigr dutch who were beyond the
drakensberg in what is now the transvaal territori thi occupi a
long time as these boer were wide scatter and at each camp we
had to stop for sever dai while retief explain everyth to it
leader also he arrang with them to come down into natal so as to
be readi to peopl it as soon as he receiv the formal cession of
the countri from dingaan inde most of them began to trek at onc
although jealousi between the variou command caus some of the
band luckili for themselv to remain on the farther side of the
mountain
at length everyth be settl we rode awai and reach the
bushman river camp on a certain saturdai afternoon here to my joi
we found all well noth had been heard of hernan pereira while the
zulu if we might judg from messeng who came to us seem to
be friendli mari also had now quit recov from the fear and
hardship which she had undergon never had i seen her look so sweet
and beauti as she did when she greet me arrai no longer in
rag but in a simpl yet charm dress made of some stuff that she
had manag to bui from a trader who came up to the camp from durban
moreov i think that there wa anoth reason for the chang sinc
the light of dawn happi shone in her deep ey
the dai as i have said wa saturdai and on the mondai she would come
of ag and be free to dispos of herself in marriag for on that dai
laps the promis which we had given to her father but ala by a
curs pervers of fate on thi veri mondai at noon the command
retief had arrang to ride into zululand on hi second visit to
dingaan and with retief i wa in honour bound to go
mari i said will not your father soften toward us and let us be
marri tomorrow so that we mai have a few hour togeth befor we
part
i do not know my dear she answer blush sinc about thi
matter he is veri strang and obstin do you know that all the time
you were absent he never mention your name and if anyon els spoke
it he would get up and go awai
that bad i said still if you ar will we might try
inde and inde allan i am will who am sick of be so near to
you and yet so far but how shall we do so
i think that we will ask the command retief and the vrouw prinsloo
to plead for us mari let us go to seek them
she nod and hand in hand we walk through the boer who nudg
each other and laugh at us as we pass to where the old vrouw wa
seat on a stool by her wagon drink coffe i rememb that her
vatdoek wa spread over her knee for she also had a new dress which
she wa afraid of stain
well my dear she said in her loud voic ar you marri alreadi
that you hang so close togeth
no my aunt i answer but we want to be and have come to you to
help us
that i will do with all my heart though to speak truth young peopl
at your ag as thing ar i should have been inclin to help myself
as i have told you befor heaven abov us what is it that make
marriag in the sight of god it is that male and femal should declar
themselv man and wife befor all folk and live as such the pastor
and hi mumbl ar veri well if you can get them but it is the
give of the hand not the set of the ring upon it it is the
vow of two true heart and not word read out of a book that make
marriag still thi is bold talk for which ani reverend prdicant
would reprov me for if young folk act on it although the tie might
hold good in law what would becom of hi fee come let us seek the
command and hear what he ha to sai allan pull me up off thi
stool where if i had my wai after so much travel i should like
to sit while a hous wa built over my head and for the rest of my
life
i obei not without difficulti and we went to find retief
at the moment he wa stand alon watch two wagon that had just
trek awai these contain hi wife with other member of hi famili
and some friend whom he wa send under the charg of the heer smit
to a place call doornkop that lai at a distanc of fifteen mile or
more at thi doornkop he had alreadi caus a rough hous or rather
shed to be built for the vrouw retief occup think that she
would be more comfort and perhap safer there dure hi absenc
than at the crowd camp in a wagon
allemacht allan he said catch sight of me my heart is sore
i do not know why i tell you that when i kiss my old woman goodby
just now i felt as though i should never see her again and the tear
came into my ey i wish we were all safe back from dingaan but there
there i will try to get over to see her tomorrow as we dont start
till mondai what is it that you want allan with that mooi mesj of
yoursand he point to the tall mari
what would ani man want with such a on save to marri her broke in
the vrouw prinsloo now command listen while i set out the tale
all right aunt onli be brief for i have no time to spare
she obei but i cannot sai that she wa brief
when at last the old ladi paus breathless retief said
i understand everyth there is no need for you young peopl to
talk now we will go and see henri marai and if he is not madder than
usual make him listen to reason
so we walk to where maraiss wagon stood at the end of the line
and found him sit on the disselboom cut up tobacco with hi
pocketknif
gooddai allan he said for we had not met sinc my return have
you had a nice journei
i wa about to answer when the command broke in impati
see here see here henri we have not come to talk about allan
journei but about hi marriag which is more import he ride with
me to zululand on mondai as you do and want to wed your daughter
tomorrow which is sundai a good dai for the deed
it is a dai to prai not to give and be given in marriag comment
marai sulkili moreov mari doe not come of ag befor mondai and
until then the oath that i made to god hold
my vatdoek for your oath exclaim the vrouw flap that aw rag
in hi face how much do you suppos that god care what you in your
folli swore to that stinkcat of a nephew of your do you be care
henri marai that god doe not make of your preciou oath a stone to
fall upon your head and break it like a peanutshel
hold your chatter tongu old woman said marai furious am i
to be taught my duti to my conscienc and my daughter by you
certainli you ar if you cannot teach them to yourself began the
vrouw set her hand upon her hip
but retief push her asid sai
no quarrel here now henri marai your conduct about these two
young peopl who love each other is a scandal will you let them be
marri tomorrow or not
no command i will not by the law i have power over my daughter
till she is of ag and i refus to allow her to marri a curs
englishman moreov the prdicant cellier is awai so there is none
to marri them
you speak strang word mynheer marai said retief quietli
especi when i rememb all that thi curs englishman ha done
for you and your for i have heard everi bit of that stori though not
from him now hearken you have appeal to the law and as command
i must allow your appeal but after twelv oclock tomorrow night
accord to your own show the law ceas to bind your daughter
therefor on mondai morn if there is no clergyman in the camp and
these two wish it i as command will marri them befor all men as
i have the power to do
then marai broke into on of those rave fit of temper which were
constitut in him and to my mind show that he wa never quit
sane oddli enough it wa on poor mari that he concentr hi wrath
he curs her horribl becaus she had withstood hi will and refus
to marri hernan pereira he prai that evil might fall on her that she
might never bear a child and that if she did it might die and other
thing too unpleas to mention
we stare at him astonish though i think that had he been ani other
man than the father of my betroth i should have struck him retief
i notic lift hi hand to do so then let it fall again mutter
let be he is possess with a devil
at last marai ceas not i think from lack of word but becaus
he wa exhaust and stood befor us hi tall form quiver and hi
thin nervou face work like that of a person in convuls then
mari who had drop her head beneath thi storm lift it and i saw
that her deep ey were all ablaz and that she wa veri white
you ar my father she said in a low voic and therefor i must
submit to whatev you choos to sai to me moreov i think it like
that the evil which you call down will fall upon me sinc satan is
alwai at hand to fulfil hi own wish but if so my father i am
sure that thi evil will recoil upon your own head not onli here but
hereaft there justic will be done to both of us perhap befor veri
long and also to your nephew hernan pereira
marai made no answer hi rage seem to have spent itself he onli sat
himself again upon the disselboom of the wagon and went on cut up
the tobacco vicious as though he were slice the heart of a foe
even the vrouw prinsloo wa silent and stare at him whilst she fan
herself with the vatdoek but retief spoke
i wonder if you ar mad or onli wick henri marai he said to
curs your own sweet girl like thi you must be on or the othera
singl child who ha alwai been good to you well as you ar to ride
with me on mondai i prai that you will keep your temper under control
lest it should bring us into troubl and you also as for you mari
my dear do not fret becaus a wild beast ha tri to toss you with hi
horn although he happen to be your father on mondai morn you
pass out of hi power into your own and on that dai i will marri you to
allan quatermain here meanwhil i think you ar safest awai from thi
father of your who might take to cut your throat instead of that
tobacco vrouw prinsloo be so good as to look after mari marai and
on mondai morn next bring her befor me to be wed until then henri
marai i as command shall set a guard over you with order to
seiz you if it should be necessari now i advis you to take a walk
and when you ar calm again to prai god to forgiv you your wick
word lest thei should be fulfil and drag you down to judgment
then we all went leav henri marai still cut up hi tobacco on
the disselboom
on the sundai i met marai walk about the camp follow by the guard
whom retief had set over him to my surpris he greet me almost with
affect
allan he said you must not misunderstand me i do not realli wish
ill to mari whom i love more dearli than i do my life god alon know
how much i love her but i made a promis to her cousin hernan my onli
sister onli child and you will understand that i cannot break that
promis although hernan ha disappoint me in mani waysy in
mani wai but if he is bad as thei sai it come with that portugues
blood which is a misfortun that he cannot help doe it not howev
bad he mai be as an honest man i am bound to keep my promis am i not
also allan you must rememb that you ar english and although you
mai be a good fellow in yourself that is a fault which you cannot
expect me to forgiv still if it is fate that you should marri my
daughter and breed english childrenheaven abov to think of it
english childrenwel there is noth more to be said dont
rememb the word i spoke to mari inde i cant rememb them
myself when i grow angri a kind of rush of blood come into my brain
and then i forget what i have said and he stretch out hi hand to
me
i shook it and answer that i understood he wa not himself when he
spoke those dread word which both mari and i wish to forget
i hope you will come to our wed tomorrow i ad and wipe them
out with a father bless
tomorrow ar you realli go to be marri tomorrow he exclaim
hi sallow face twitch nervous o god it wa anoth man that
i dream to see stand by mari side but he is not here he ha
disgrac and desert me well i will come if my gaoler will suffer
it goodby you happi bridegroom of tomorrow goodby
then he swung round and depart follow by the guard on of whom
touch hi brow and shook hi head significantli as he pass me
i think that sundai seem the longest dai i ever spent the vrouw
prinsloo would scarc allow me even a glimps of mari becaus of
some fad she had got into her mind that it wa either not proper or not
fortun i forget which that a bride and bridegroom should associ
on the ev of their marriag so i occupi myself as best i could
first i wrote a long letter to my father the third that i had sent
tell him everyth that wa go to happen and sai how griev
i wa that he could not be present to marri us and give us hi bless
thi letter i gave to a trader who wa trek to the bai on the
follow morn beg him to forward it by the first opportun
that duti done i saw about the hors which i wa take into zululand
three of them two for myself and on for han who accompani me as
afterrid also the saddleri saddlebag gun and ammunit must be
overhaul all of which took some time
you ar go to spend a strang wittebroodsweek whitebreadweek or
in other word honeymoon baa said han squint at me with hi
littl ey as he brai awai at a buckskin which wa to serv as a
saddlecloth now if i wa to be marri tomorrow i should stop
with my pretti for a few dai and onli ride off somewher els when
i wa tire of her especi if that somewher els chanc to be
zululand where thei ar so fond of kill peopl
i dare sai you would han and so would i if i could you be sure
but you see the command want me to interpret and therefor it is
my duti to go with him
duti what is duti baa love i understand it is for love of you that
i go with you also for fear lest you should caus me to be beaten if i
refus otherwis i would certainli stop here in the camp where there
is plenti to eat and littl work to do as were i you i should do also
for love of that white missi but dutypah that is a foolword which
make bone of a man befor hi time and leav hi girl to other
of cours you do not understand han ani more than you colour
peopl understand what gratitud is but what do you mean about thi
trek of our ar you afraid
he shrug hi shoulder a littl perhap baa at least i should
be if i thought about the morrow which i dont sinc todai is enough
for me and think about what on cant know make the head ach
dingaan is not a nice man baa we saw that didnt we he is a hunter
who know how to set a trap also he ha the baa pereira up there to
help him so perhap you might be more comfort here kiss missi
mari why do you not sai that you have hurt your leg and cannot run
it would not be much troubl to walk about on a crutch for a dai or two
and when the command wa well gone your leg might heal and you could
throw the stick awai
get thee behind me satan i mutter to myself and wa about to give
han a piec of my mind when i recollect that the poor fellow had hi
own wai of look at thing and could not be blame also as he said
he love me and onli suggest what he thought would tend to my joi and
safeti how could i suppos that he would be interest in the success
of a diplomat mission to dingaan or think anyth about it except
that it wa a riski busi so i onli said
han if you ar afraid you had better stop behind i can easili find
anoth afterrid
is the baa angri with me that he should speak so ask the
hottentot have i not alwai been true to him and if i should be
kill what doe it matter have i not said that i do not think about
tomorrow and we must all go to sleep sometim no unless the baa
beat me back i shall come with him but baasthi in a wheedl
toney might give me some brandi to drink your health in tonight
it is veri good to get drunk when on ha to be sober and perhap dead
for a long time afterward it would be nice to rememb when on is a
spook or an angel with white wing such as the old baa your father
us to tell us about in school on the sabbath
at thi point find han hopeless i got up and walk awai leav
him to finish our prepar
that even there wa a prayermeet in the camp for although no
pastor wa present on of the boer elder took hi place and offer
up supplic which if simpl and even absurd in their word at
least were hearti enough amongst other request i rememb that he
petit for the safeti of those who were to go on the mission to
dingaan and of those who were to remain behind ala those prayer
were not heard for it pleas the power to whom thei were address to
decre otherwis
after thi meet in which i took an earnest share retief who just
befor it began had ridden in from doornkop whither he had been to
visit hi wife held a kind of council whereat the name of those who
had volunt or been order to accompani him were final taken
down at thi council there wa a good deal of discuss sinc mani of
the boer did not think the expedit wiseat ani rate if it wa to
be carri out on so larg a scale on of them i forget which an old
man point out that it might look like a war parti and that it would
be wiser if onli five or six went as thei had done befor sinc then
there could be no mistak as to the peac natur of their intent
retief himself combat thi view and at last turn suddenli to me
who wa listen near by and said
allan quatermain you ar young but you have a good judgment also
you ar on of the veri few who know dingaan and can speak hi languag
tell us now what do you think
thu adjur i answer perhap move thereto more than i thought
by hanss talk that i too consid the thing danger and that
someon whose life wa less valuabl than the command should go in
command
why do you sai so nephew he said irrit see that all
white men live ar of equal valu and i can smell no danger in the
busi
becaus command i do smell danger though what danger i cannot
sai ani more than a dog or a buck can when it sniff someth in the
air and bark or run dingaan is a tame tiger just now but tiger ar

guilti knowledg
chapter xvii the marriag
i wa awaken on my wed morn by the crash and bellow of
a great thunderstorm the lightn flash fearfulli all about us
kill two oxen quit near to my wagon and the thunder roll and
echo till the veri earth seem to shake then came a wail of cold
wind and after that the swish of torrenti rain although i wa well
accustom to such natur manifest especi at thi season of
the year i confess that these sight and sound did not tend to rais
my spirit which were alreadi lower than thei should have been on
that event dai han howev who arriv to help me put on my best
cloth for the ceremoni wa for onc consol
dont look sick baa he said for if there is storm in the morn

happen between the storm of the morn and the peac of the night
it wa arrang that the commiss which count the nativ
afterrid consist of over a hundr peopl among them sever
boi who were littl more than children wa to ride at on hour befor
noon nobodi could get about to make the necessari prepar until
the heavi rain had pass awai which it did a littl after eight
oclock therefor when i left the wagon to eat or try to eat some
breakfast i found the whole camp in a state of bustl
boer were shout to their servant hors were be examin women
were pack the saddlebag of their husband and father with spare
cloth the packbeast were be laden with biltong and other
provis and so forth
in the midst of all thi tumult i began to wonder whether my privat

wagon box be too shy to mix with that crowd of busi mocker or to go

becaus you ar not there also there is anoth wait and oh she
look love when thei see her everi man in the camp will want her for
himself whether he ha got a wife or not for in that matter although
you maynt think so just now thei ar all the same as the kaffir oh

while she held forth thu in her usual outspoken fashion the vrouw wa
drag me along by the hand just as though i were a naughti littl
boi nor could i get free from that mighti grip or when onc her great
bulk wa in motion match my weight against it of cours some of the
younger boer who know her errand had follow her set up a shout
of cheer and laughter which attract everybodi to the process
it is too late to hang back now englishman you must make the best
of a bad busi if you want to chang your mind you should have
done it befor men and women roar and scream with mani other such
banter word till at length i felt myself turn the colour of a red
vlei lili

allan went on the command pull out a silver watch like a
turnip you have just half an hour befor we ride and the vrouw
prinsloo sai that she ha made you a wed meal in that tent there
so you had best go eat it
to the tent we went accordingli to find a simpl but bounteou feast

wa the custom with newwed folk also mani boer came in and drank
our health although the vrouw prinsloo told them that it would have
been more decent to leav us alon but henri marai did not come or
drink our health
thu the halfhour went all too swiftli and not a word did we get
alon at last in despair see that han wa alreadi wait with the
hors i drew mari asid motion to everyon to stand back
dearest wife i said in broken word thi is a strang begin to

why should anyth chanc mari we ar a strong and wellarm
parti and dingaan look on us peacefulli
i dont know husband but thei sai hernan pereira is with the zulu
and he hate you
then he had better mind hi manner or he will not be here long to

someth that is hidden from us she ad shrewdli you sai you
dont well it is not like you would tell us if you did look thei
ar call you must go come on mari let us see them off
so we went to where the commiss wa gather on horseback just in
time to hear retief address the peopl or rather the last of hi
word
friend he said we go upon an import busi from which i
hope we shall return happili within a veri littl time still thi is
a rough countri and we have to deal with rough peopl therefor my
advic to all you who stai behind is that you should not scatter but
keep togeth so that in case of ani troubl the men who ar left mai
be at hand to defend thi camp for if thei ar here you have noth
to fear from all the savag in africa and now god be with you and
goodby come trek brother trek
then follow a few moment of confus while men kiss their wive
children and sister in farewel or shook each other by the hand i
too kiss mari and tumbl on to my hors somehow rode awai my
ey blind with tear for thi part wa bitter when i could see
clearli again i pull up and look back at the camp which wa now at
some distanc it seem a peac place inde for although the storm
of the morn wa return and a pall of dark cloud hung over it the
sun still shone upon the white wagon cap and the peopl who went to and
fro among them
who could have thought that within a littl time it would be but a field
of blood that those wagon would be riddl with assegai and that the
women and children who were move there must most of them lie upon
the veld mutil corps dread to behold ala the boer alwai
impati of author and confid that their own individu judgment
wa the best did not obei their command order to keep togeth
thei went off thi wai and that to shoot the game which wa then so
plenti leav their famili almost without protect thu the
zulu found and slew them
present as i rode forward a littl apart from the other someon
overtook me and i saw that it wa henri marai
well allan he said so god ha given you to me for a soninlaw
who would have thought it you do not look to me like a newmarri
man for that marriag is not natur when the bridegroom ride off and
leav the bride of an hour perhap you will never be realli marri
after all for god who give sonsinlaw can also take them awai
especi when he wa not ask for them ah he went on laps into
french as wa hi wont when move qui vivra verra qui vivra verra
then shout thi excel but obviou proverb at the top of hi
voic he struck hi hors with the butt of hi gun and gallop awai
befor i could answer him
at that moment i hate henri marai as i had never hate anyon befor
not even hi nephew hernan almost did i ride to the command to
complain of him but reflect to myself first that he wa undoubtedli
half mad and therefor not respons for hi action and secondli
that he wa better here with us than in the same camp with my wife
i gave up the idea yet ala it is the halfmad who ar the most
danger of lunat
han who had observ thi scene and overheard all maraiss talk
and who also knew the state of the case well enough sidl hi hors
alongsid of me and whisper in a wheedl voic
baa i think the old baa is kransick and not safe he look like on
who is go to harm someon now baa suppos i let my gun off by
accid you know we colour peopl ar veri careless with gun the
heer marai would never be troubl with ani more fanci and you and
the missi mari and all of us would be safer also you could not
be blame nor could i for who can help an accid gun will go off
sometim baa when you dont want them to
get out i answer yet if hanss gun had chanc to go off i
believ it might have save a multitud of live
chapter xviii the treati
our journei to umgungundhlovu wa prosper and without incid when
we were within half a dai march from the great kraal we overtook the
herd of cattl that we had recaptur from sikonyela for these beast
had been driven veri slowli and well rest that thei might arriv in

februari about middai and forc them through it gate into the cattl
kraal then we offsaddl and at our dinner under those two milk
tree near the gate of the kraal where i had bid goodby to dingaan
after dinner messeng came to ask us to visit the king and with them
the youth thoma halstead who told the command that all weapon
must be left behind sinc it wa the zulu law that no man might appear
befor the king arm to thi retief demur whereon the messeng
appeal to me whom thei had recognis ask if that were not the
custom of their countri
i answer that i had not been in it long enough to know then there wa
a paus while thei sent for someon to bear evid at the time i
did not know whom as i wa not near enough to thoma halstead to make
inquiri present thi someon appear and turn out to be none
other than hernan pereira
he advanc toward us attend by zulu as though he were a chief
look fat and well and handsom than ever see retief he lift
hi hat with a flourish and held out hi hand which i note the
command did not take
so you ar still here mynheer pereira he said coldli now be good
enough to tell me what is thi matter about the abandon of our
arm
the king charg me to sai began hernan
charg you to sai mynheer pereira ar you then thi black man
servant but continu

well then mynheer be pleas to go tell thi king that we do not
wish to come to hi privat enclosur i have brought the cattl that he
desir me to fetch and i am will to deliv them to him wherev he
wish but we will not unarm in order to do so
now there wa talk and messeng were despatch who return at full
speed present to sai that dingaan would receiv the boer in the great
danc place in the midst of the kraal and that thei might bring their
gun as he wish to see how thei fire them
so we rode in make as fine a show as we could to find that the
danc place which measur a good mani acr in extent wa line
round with thousand of plume but unarm warrior arrang in
regiment
you see i heard pereira sai to retief these have no spear
no answer the command but thei have stick which when thei
ar a hundr to on would serv as well
meanwhil the vast mob of cattl were be driven in a doubl stream
past a knot of men at the head of the space and then awai through gate
behind when the beast had all gone we approach these men among whom
i recognis the fat form of dingaan drape in a bead mantl we rang
ourselv in a semicircl befor him and stood while he search us
with hi sharp ey present he saw me and sent a councillor to sai
that i must come and interpret for him
so dismount i went with retief thoma halstead and a few of the
lead boer
sakubona good dai macumazahn said dingaan i am glad that you
have come as i know that you will speak my word truli be on of
the peopl of georg whom i love for thomaa here i do not trust
although he is also a son of georg
i told retief what he said
oh he exclaim with a grunt it seem that you english ar a step
in front of us boer even here
then he went forward and shook hand with the king whom it will be
rememb he had visit befor
after that the indaba or talk began which i do not propos to set
out at length for it is a matter of histori it is enough to sai that
dingaan after thank retief for recov the cattl ask where
wa sikonyela the chief who had stolen them as he wish to kill him
when he learn that sikonyela remain in hi own countri he becam
or affect to becom angri then he ask where were the sixti hors
which he heard we had captur from sikonyela as thei must be given up
to him
retief by wai of repli touch hi grei hair and inquir whether
dingaan thought that he wa a child that he dingaan should demand
hors which did not belong to him he ad that these hors had been
restor to the boer from whom sikonyela had stolen them
when dingaan had express himself satisfi with thi answer retief
open the question of the treati the king repli howev that the
white men had but just arriv and he wish to see them danc after
their own fashion as for the busi it might sit still till
anoth dai
so in the end the boer danc for hi amus that is thei
divid into two parti and charg each other at full gallop fire
their gun into the air an exhibit which seem to fill all present
with admir and aw when thei paus the king wish them to go on
fire a hundr shot apiec but the command declin sai he
had no more powder to wast
what do you want powder for in a peac countri ask dingaan
suspici
retief answer through me
to kill food for ourselv or to protect ourselv if ani evilmind
men should attack us
then it will not be want here said dingaan sinc i will give you
food and as i the king am your friend no man in zululand dare be
your enemi
retief said he wa glad to hear it and ask leav to retir with the
boer to hi camp outsid the gate as thei were all tire with ride
thi dingaan grant and we said goodby and went awai befor i
reach the gate howev a messeng i rememb it wa my old friend
kambula overtook me and said that the king wish to speak with me
alon i answer him that i could not speak with the king alon without
the permiss of the command thereon kambula said

taken by forc
now i told han to gallop on to retief and tell him of my predica
for alreadi i saw that at some sign from kambula i wa be surround

refus to allow you to do so
to thi question kambula answer wa

macumazahn therefor we must obei order and take him befor the king
live or dead
allemacht exclaim retief thi is seriou and as though to
summon them to my help he look behind him toward the main bodi of
the boer who by thi time were nearli all of them through the gate
which wa guard by a great number of zulu allan he went on if
you ar not afraid i think that you must go perhap it is onli that
dingaan ha some messag about the treati to send to me through you
i am not afraid i answer what is the us of be afraid in a
place like thi
ask that kaffir if the king give you safe conduct said retief
i did so and kambula answer

own king and run awai from him
i answer ye thei had run awai as thei want more room to live
but i had told him all about that when i saw him befor he said he knew
i had but he wish to hear whether the same word came out of the
same mouth or differ word so that he might know if i were a true
man or not then after paus a while he look at me in hi pierc
fashion and ask

when you rode in with the rest that thei might all of them know you
that good for me as far as it goe i repli but i dont know why

who want to harm me
there is that allan quatermain the induna tell me that the
goodlook portuge whom thei call twofac ask the king to kill
you everi time he see him inde iv heard him myself
that kind of him i answer but then hernan pereira and i
never got on tell me what is he talk about to the king when he isnt
ask him to kill me

allow to come here at all in order to get their treati sign at
least on dai when i wa interpret and dingaan swore that he would
not give them more land than wa enough to buri them in pereira told
him that it didnt matter what he sign as what wa written with the
pen could be scratch out with the spear
inde and what did the king sai to that
oh he laugh and said it wa true and that he would give the boer
commiss all their peopl want and someth over for themselv
but dont you repeat that quatermain for if you do and it get to the
ear of dingaan i shall certainli be kill and i sai your a good
fellow and i won a big bet on you over that vultur shoot so i will
give you a bit of advic which you will be wise to take you get out of
thi countri as soon as you can and go to look after that pretti miss
marai whom you ar sweet on dingaan want her and what dingaan want

then without wait to be thank he turn and disappear among
a crowd of zulu who were follow us from curios leav me
wonder whether or no dingaan wa right when he call thi young man
a liar hi stori seem to talli so well with that told by the king
himself that on the whole i thought he wa not

i went straight to the hut that wa allot to retief in the littl
outli guardkraal which had been given to us for a camp here i
found the command seat on a kaffir stool engag in painfulli
write a letter us a bit of board place on hi knee as a desk
he look up and ask me how i had got on with dingaan not be
sorri as i think of an excus to paus in hi cleric labour

be overheard i told him everi word that had pass in the interview i
had just had with dingaan with thoma halstead and with pereira
he heard me out in silenc then said
thi is a strang and ugli stori allan and if it is true pereira
must be an even bigger scoundrel than i thought him but i cant believ
that it is true i think that dingaan ha been ly to you for hi own
purpos i mean about the plot to kill you
perhap command i dont know and i dont much care but i am sure
that he wa not ly when he said he meant to steal awai my wife either
for himself or for pereira

i intend command with your permiss to send han my
afterrid back to the camp with a letter for mari tell her to
remov herself quietli to the farm i have chosen down on the river of

sinc i cannot spare you to go yourself onli you must not send thi
hottentot who would talk and frighten the peopl i am despatch
a messeng to the camp to tell them of our safe arriv and good
recept by dingaan he can take your letter in which i order you to

the writingboard with hi fist on the first opportun i will myself
take the evid of dingaan and of the english lad halstead if i find
thei tell me the same stori thei have told you i will put pereira on
hi trial as i threaten to do befor and should he be found guilti
by god i will have him shot but for the present it is best to do
noth except keep an ey on him lest we should caus fear and
scandal in the camp and after all not prove the case now go and
write your letter and leav me to write mine
so i went and wrote tell mari someth but by no mean all of
that i have set down i bade her and the prinsloo and the meyer if
thei would accompani her as i wa sure thei would move themselv
off at onc to the farm i had beacon out thirti mile awai from the
bushman river under pretenc of see how the hous that were be
built there were get on or if thei would not go i bade her go
alon with a few hottentot servant or ani other companion she could

thi letter i took to retief and read it to him at my request also
he scrawl at the foot of it
i have seen the abov and approv it know all the stori which mai
be true or fals do as your husband bid you but do not talk of it in
the camp except to those whom he mentionspiet retief
so the messeng depart at dawn and in due cours deliv my letter
to mari
the next dai wa sundai in the morn i went to call upon the reverend
mr owen the missionari who wa veri glad to see me he inform me
that dingaan wa in good mind toward us and had been ask him if he
would write the treati cede the land which the boer want i stop
for servic at the hut of mr owen and then return to the camp in
the afternoon dingaan celebr a great war danc for us to wit in
which about twelv thousand soldier took part
it wa a wonder and aweinspir spectacl and i rememb that each
of the regiment emploi had a number of train oxen which manoeuvr
with them appar at given word of command we did not see dingaan
that dai except at a distanc and after the danc wa over return to
our camp to eat the beef which he had provid for us in plenti
on the third daythat wa mondai the 5th of februari there were more
danc and sham fight so mani more inde that we began to weari
of thi savag show late in the afternoon howev dingaan sent for
the command and hi men to come to see him sai that he wish to
talk with him about the matter of the treati so we went but onli three
or four of whom i wa on were admit to dingaan presenc the
rest remain at a littl distanc where thei could see us but were
out of earshot
dingaan then produc a paper which had been written by the reverend
mr owen thi document which i believ still exist for it wa found
afterward wa drawn up in legal or semileg form begin like a
proclam know all men
it cede the place call port natal togeth with all the land
annexedthat is to sai from tugela to the umzimvubu river westward
and from the sea to the northto the boer for their everlast
properti at the king request as the deed wa written in english
by mr owen i translat it to him and afterward the lad halstead
translat it also be call in to do so when i had finish
thi wa done that my render might be check and the fact impress
all the boer veri favour it show them that the king desir to
understand exactli what he wa to sign which would not have been the
case had he intend ani trick or propos to cheat them afterward
from that moment forward retief and hi peopl had no further doubt
as to dingaan good faith in thi matter and foolishli relax all
precaut against treacheri
when the translat wa finish the command ask the king if he
would sign the paper then and there he answer no he would sign it
on the follow morn befor the commiss return to natal
it wa then that retief inquir of dingaan through thoma halstead
whether it wa a true stori which he had heard that the boer call
pereira who had been stai with him and whom the zulu knew by the
name of twofac had again ask him dingaan to have me allan
quatermain whom thei call macumazahn kill dingaan laugh and
answer
ye that is true enough for he hate thi macumazahn but let the
littl white son of georg have no fear sinc my heart is soft toward
him and i swear by the head of the black on that he shall come to no
harm in zululand is he not my guest as you ar
he then went on to sai that if the command wish it he would have
twofac seiz and kill becaus he had dare to ask for my life
retief answer that he would look into that matter himself and after
thoma halstead had confirm the king stori as to pereira conduct
he rose and said goodby to dingaan
of thi matter of hernan pereira retief said littl as we went back to
the camp outsid the kraal though the littl that he did sai show hi
deep anger when we arriv at the camp howev he sent for pereira
and marai and sever of the older boer i rememb that among these
were gerrit bothma senior hendrik labuschagn and matthi pretoriu
senior all of them person of stand and judgment i also wa order
to be present when pereira arriv retief charg him openli with
have plot my murder and ask him what he had to sai of cours
hi answer wa a flat denial and an accus against me of have
invent the tale becaus we had been at enmiti over a maiden whom i had
sinc marri
then mynheer pereira said retief as allan quatermain here ha won
the maiden who is now hi wife it would seem that hi caus of enmiti
must have ceas wherea your mai well have remain howev i have
no time to try case of the sort now but i warn you that thi on will
be look into later on when we get back to natal whither i shall take
you with me and that meanwhil an ey is kept on you and what you do
also i warn you that i have evid for all that i sai now be so good
as to go and to keep out of my sight as much as possibl for i do not
like a man whom these kaffir name twofac as for you friend henri
marai i tell you that you would do well to associ yourself less
with on whose name is under so dark a cloud although he mai be your
own nephew whom all know you love blindli
so far as i recollect neither of them made ani answer to thi direct
speech thei simpli turn and went awai but on the next morn that
of the fatal 6th of februari when i chanc to meet the command
retief as he wa ride through the camp make arrang for our
departur to natal he pull up hi hors and said
allan hernan pereira ha gone and henri marai with him and for my
part i am not sorri for doubtless we shall meet again in thi world or
the next and find out all the truth here read thi and give it back
to me afterward and he threw me a paper and rode on
i open the fold sheet and read as follow
to the command retief governor of the emigr boer
mynheer command
i will not stai here where such foul accus ar laid on me by
black kaffir and the englishman allan quatermain who like all hi
race is an enemi of us boer and although you do not know it a
traitor who is plot great harm against you with the zulu therefor
i leav you but am readi to meet everi charg at the right time befor
a proper court my uncl henri marai come with me as he feel that
hi honour is also touch moreov he ha heard that hi daughter
mari is in danger from the zulu and return to protect her which
he who is call her husband neglect to do allan quatermain the
englishman who is the friend of dingaan can explain what i mean
for he know more about the zulu plan than i do as you will find out
befor the end
then follow the signatur of hernan pereira and henri marai
i put the letter in my pocket wonder what might be it precis
mean and in particular that of the absurd and undefin charg
of treacheri against myself it seem to me that pereira had left us
becaus he wa afraid of somethingeith that he might be place upon
hi trial or of some ultim catastroph in which he would be involv
marai probabl had gone with him for the same reason that a bit of iron
follow a magnet becaus he never could resist the attract of thi
evil man hi rel by birth or perhap he had learn from him
the stori of hi daughter danger upon which i had alreadi act and
realli wa anxiou about her safeti for it must alwai be rememb
that marai love mari passion howev ill the reader of thi
histori mai think that he behav to her she wa hi darl the appl
of hi ey and her great offenc in hi sight wa that she care for me
more than she did for him that is on of the reason why he hate me as
much as he love her
almost befor i had finish read thi letter the order came that we
were to go in a bodi to bid farewel to dingaan leav our arm
pile beneath the two milk tree at the gate of the town most of our
afterrid were command to accompani usi think becaus retief
wish to make as big a show as possibl to impress the zulu a few
of these hottentot howev were told to stai behind that thei might
collect the hors that were kneehalt and graze at a distanc
and saddl them up among these wa han for as it chanc i saw and
sent him with the other so that i might be sure that my own hors
would be found and made readi for the journei
just as we were start i met the lad william wood who had come down
from the mission hut where he live with mr owen and wa wander
about with an anxiou face
how ar you william i ask
not veri well mr quatermain he answer the fact is he ad
with a burst of confid i feel queerli about you all the kaffir
have told me that someth is go to happen to you and i think you
ought to know it i darent sai ani more and he vanish into the
crowd
at that moment i caught sight of retief ride to and fro and shout
out order go to him i caught him by the sleev sai
command listen to me
well what is it now nephew he ask absent
i told him what wood had said ad that i also wa uneasi i did not
know why
oh he answer with impati thi is all hailston and burnt
grass mean that the on would melt and the other blow awai or in
our english idiom stuff and rubbish why ar you alwai try to
scare me with your fanci allan dingaan is our friend not our enemi
so let us take the gift that fortun give us and be thank come
march
thi he said about eight oclock in the morn
we stroll through the gate of the great kraal most of the boer
who as usual had pile their arm under the two milk tree loung
along in knot of four or five laugh and chat as thei went i
have often thought sinc that although everi on of them there except
myself wa doom within an hour to have taken the dread step from
time into etern it seem strang that advanc fate should have
thrown no shadow on their heart on the contrari thei were quit gai
be extrem pleas at the success issu of their mission and the
prospect of an immedi return to their wive and children even retief
wa gai for i heard him joke with hi companion about myself and my
whitebreadweek or honeymoon which he said wa draw veri near
as we went i notic that most of the regiment who had perform the
great militari danc befor us on the previou dai were gone two
howev remainedth ischlangu inhlop that is the white shield
who were a corp of veteran wear the ring on their head and the
ischlangu umnyama that is the black shield who were all of them
young men without ring the white shield were rang along the
fenc of the great open place to our left and the black shield were
similarli place to our right each regiment number about fifteen
hundr men except for their kerri and dancingstick thei were
unarm
present we reach the head of the danc ground and found dingaan
seat in hi chair with two of hi great induna umhlela and tambusa
squat on either side of him behind him stand in and about the
entranc to the labyrinth through which the king had come were other
induna and captain on arriv in front of dingaan we salut him
and he acknowledg the salut with pleasant word and smile then
retief two or three of the other boer thoma halstead and i went
forward whereon the treati wa produc again and identifi as the
same document that we had seen on the previou dai
at the foot of it someonei forget whowrot in dutch de merk van
kone dingaan that is the mark of king dingaan in the space left
between the word merk and van dingaan made a cross with a pen that
wa given to him thoma halstead hold hi hand and show him what

after thi three of hi induna or great councillor who were name
nwara yuliwana and manondo testifi as wit for the zulu and
m oosthuyzen a c greyl and b j liebenberg who were stand
nearest to retief as wit for the boer
thi done dingaan order on of hi isibongo or praiser to run
to and fro in front of the regiment and other there assembl and
proclaim that he had grant natal to the boer to be their properti
for ever inform which the zulu receiv with shout then dingaan
ask retief if he would not eat and larg trencher of boil beef
were brought out and hand round thi howev the boer refus
sai thei had alreadi breakfast thereon the king said that at least
thei must drink and pot of twala or kaffir beer were hand round
of which all the boer partook
while thei were drink dingaan gave retief a messag to the dutch
farmer to the effect that he hope thei would soon come and occupi
natal which henceforth wa their countri also blackheart villain
that he wa that thei would have a pleasant journei home next he
order the two regiment to danc and sing war song in order to amus
hi guest
thi thei began to do draw nearer as thei danc
it wa at thi moment that a zulu appear push hi wai through the
captain who were gather at the gate of the labyrinth and deliv
some messag to on of the induna who in turn pass it on to the
king
ow is it so said the king with a troubl look then hi glanc fell
on me as though by accid and he ad macumazahn on of my wive
is taken veri ill suddenli and sai she must have some of the medicin
of the white men befor thei go awai now you tell me that you ar a
newmarri man so i can trust you with my wive i prai you to go

tongu
i hesit then translat what he had said to retief
you had best go nephew said the command but come back quickli
for we ride at onc
still i hesit not like thi busi whereon the king began to
grow angri
what he said do you white men refus me thi littl favour when i
have just given you so muchyou who have wonder medicin that can
cure the sick
go allan go said retief when he understood hi word or he will
grow cross and everyth mai be undon
so have no choic i went through the gatewai into the labyrinth
next moment men pounc on me and befor i could utter a word a cloth
wa thrown over my mouth and ti tight behind my head
i wa a prison and gag
chapter xix depart in peac
a tall kaffir on of the king household guard who carri an
assegai came up to me and whisper
hearken littl son of georg the king would save you if he can
becaus you ar not dutch but english yet know that if you try to cry
out if you even struggl you die and he lift the assegai so as to
be readi to plung it through my heart
now i understood and a cold sweat broke out all over me my companion
were to be murder everi on oh gladli would i have given my life
to warn them but ala i could not for the cloth upon my mouth wa so
thick that no sound could pass it
on of the zulu insert a stick between the reed of the fenc
work it to and fro sidewai he made an open just in a line with
my eyesout of cruelti i suppos for now i must see everyth
for some timeten minut i dare sayth danc and beerdrink
went on then dingaan rose from hi chair and shook the hand of retief
warmli bid him hamba gachl that is depart gentli or in peac
he retreat toward the gate of the labyrinth and as he went the boer
took off their hat wave them in the air and cheer him he wa
almost through it and i began to breath again
doubtless i wa mistaken after all no treacheri wa intend
in the veri open of the gate dingaan turn howev and said two
word in zulu which mean
seiz them
instantli the warrior who had now danc quit close and were wait
for these word rush upon the boer i heard thoma halstead call out
in english
we ar done for and then add in zulu let me speak to the king
dingaan heard also and wave hi hand to show that he refus to
listen and as he did so shout thrice
bulala abatagati that is slai the wizard
i saw poor halstead draw hi knife and plung it into a zulu who wa
near him the man fell and again he struck at anoth soldier cut
hi throat the boer also drew their knivesthos of them who had
timeand tri to defend themselv against these black devil who
rush on them in swarm i heard afterward that thei succeed in
kill six or eight of them and wound perhap a score but it wa
soon over for what could men arm onli with pocketkn do against
such a multitud
present amidst a hideou tumult of shout groan curs prayer
for merci and zulu battl cri the boer were all struck downy
even the two littl lad and the hottentot servant then thei were
drag awai still live by the soldier their heel trail on the
ground just as wound worm or insect ar drag by the black ant
dingaan wa stand by me now laugh hi fat face work
nervous
come son of georg he said and let us see the end of these
traitor to your sovereign
then i wa pull along to an emin within the labyrinth whenc
there wa a view of the surround countri here we wait a littl
while listen to the tumult that grew more distant till present
the dread process of death reappear come round the fenc of
the great kraal and head straight for the hill of slaughter hloma
amabutu soon it slope were climb and there among the darkleav
bush and the rock the black soldier butcher them everi on
i saw and swoon awai
i believ that i remain senseless for mani hour though toward the
end of that time my swoon grew thin as it were and i heard a hollow
voic speak over me in zulu
i am glad that the littl son of georg ha been save said the
echo voic which i did not know for he ha a great destini and
will be us to the black peopl in time to come then the voic went
on
o hous of senzangacona now you have mix your milk with blood with
white blood of that bowl you shall drink to the dreg and afterward
must the bowl be shatter and the speaker laugheda deep dread
laugh that i wa not to hear again for year
i heard him go awai shuffl along like some great reptil and then
with an effort open my ey i wa in a larg hut and the onli light
in the hut came from a fire that burn in it centr for it wa night
time a zulu woman young and goodlook wa bend over a
gourd near the fire do someth to it content i spoke to her
lightheadedli
o woman i said is that a man who laugh over me
not altogeth macumazahn she answer in a pleasant voic that
wa zikali the mighti magician the counsellor of king the open of
road he whose birth our grandfath do not rememb he whose breath
caus the tree to be torn out by the root he whom dingaan fear and
obei
did he caus the boer to be kill i ask
mayhap she answer who am i that i should know of such matter
ar you the woman who wa sick whom i wa sent to visit i ask
again
ye macumazahn i wa sick but now i am well and you ar sick for so
thing go round drink thi and she hand me a gourd of milk
how ar you name i inquir as i took it
naya is my name she repli and i am your jailer dont think
that you can escap me though macumazahn for there ar other jailer
without who carri spear drink
so i drank and bethought me that the draught might be poison yet so
thirsti wa i that i finish it everi drop
now am i a dead man i ask as i put down the gourd
no no macumazahn she who call herself naya repli in a soft
voic not a dead man onli on who will sleep and forget
then i lost count of everyth and sleptfor how long i know not
when i awok again it wa broad daylight in fact the sun stood high in
the heaven perhap naya had put some drug into my milk or perhap i
had simpli slept i do not know at ani rate i wa grate for that
sleep for without it i think that i should have gone mad as it wa
when i rememb which it took me some time to do for a while i went
near to insan
i recollect ly there in that hut and wonder how the almighti
could have permit such a deed as i had seen done how could it be
reconcil with ani theori of a love and merci father those poor
boer whatev their fault and thei had mani like the rest of us
were in the main good and honest men accord to their light yet thei
had been doom to be thu brutal butcher at the nod of a savag
despot their wive widow their children left fatherless or as it
prove in the end in most case murder or orphan
the mysteri wa too greatgreat enough to throw off it balanc the
mind of a young man who had wit such a fearsom scene as i have
describ
for some dai realli i think that my reason hung just upon the edg of
that mental precipic in the end howev reflect and educ
of which i had a certain amount thank to my father came to my aid i
recal that such massacr often on an infinit larger scale
had happen a thousand time in histori and that still through them
often inde by mean of them civilis ha march forward and
merci and peac have kiss each other over the bloodi grave of the
victim
therefor even in my youth and inexperi i conclud that some
ineff purpos wa at work through thi horror and that the live
of those poor men which had been thu sacrif were necessari to that
purpos thi mai appear a dread and fatalist doctrin but it
is on that is corrobor in natur everi dai and doubtless the
suffer meet with their compens in some other state inde if
it be not so faith and all the religion ar vain
or of cours it mai chanc that such monstrou calam happen not
through the will of the merci power of which i have spoken but in
it despit perhap the devil of scriptur at whom we ar inclin to
smile is still veri real and activ in thi world of our perhap from
time to time some evil principl break into erupt like the prison
forc of a volcano bear death and miseri on it wing until in the
end it must depart strengthless and overcom who can sai
the question is on that should be refer to the archbishop of
canterburi and the pope of rome in conclav with the lama of thibet for
umpir in case thei disagre i onli try to put down the thought that
struck me so long ago as my mind render them todai but veri like
thei ar not quit the same thought for a full gener ha gone by
me sinc then and in that time the intellig ripen as wine doe in
a bottl
besid these gener matter i had question of my own to consid
dure those dai of imprisonmentfor instanc that of my own safeti
though of thi to be honest i thought littl if i were go to be
kill i wa go to be kill and there wa an end but my knowledg
of dingaan told me that he had not massacr retief and hi companion
for noth thi would be but the prelud to a larger slaughter for i
had not forgotten what he said as to the spare of mari and the other
hint he gave me
from all thi i conclud quit rightli as it prove that some gener
onslaught wa be made upon the boer who probabl would be swept out
to the last man and to think that here i wa a prison in a kaffir
kraal with onli a young woman as a jailer and yet utterli unabl to
escap to warn them for round my hut lai a courtyard and round it
again ran a reed fenc about five feet six inch high whenev i
look over thi fenc by night or by dai i saw soldier station at
interv of about fifteen yard there thei stood like statu their
broad spear in their hand all look inward toward the fenc
there thei stoodonli at night their number wa doubl clearli it wa
not meant that i should escap
a week went by thusbeliev me a veri terribl week dure that time
my sole companion wa the pretti young woman naya we becam friend
in a wai and talk on a varieti of subject onli at the end of our
convers i alwai found that i had gain no inform whatsoev
about ani matter of immedi interest on such point as the histori of
the zulu and kindr tribe or the charact of chaka the great king
or anyth els that wa remot she would discours by the hour but
when we came to current event she dri up like water on a redhot
brick still naya grew or pretend to grow quit attach to me she
even suggest nave that i might do wors than marri her which she
said dingaan wa quit readi to allow as he wa fond of me and thought
i should be us in hi countri when i told her that i wa alreadi
marri she shrug her shine shoulder and ask with a laugh that
reveal her beauti teeth
what doe that matter cannot a man have more wive than on and
macumazahn she ad lean forward and look at me how do you
know that you have even on you mai be divorc or a widow by now
what do you mean i ask

naya i said you ar two bad thingsa bait and a spyand you know
it
perhap i do macumazahn she answer am i to blame for that if my
life is on it especi when i realli like you for yourself
i dont know i said tell me when am i go to get out of thi
place
how can i tell you macumazahn naya repli pat my hand in her
genial wai but i think befor long when you ar gone macumazahn
rememb me kindli sometim as i have realli tri to make you as
comfort as i could with a watcher stare through everi straw in the
hut
i said whatev seem to be appropri and next morn my
deliver came while i wa eat my breakfast in the courtyard at
the back of the hut naya thrust her handsom and pleasant face round
the corner and said that there wa a messeng to see me from the king
leav the rest of the meal unswallow i went to the doorwai of the
yard and there found my old friend kambula
greet inkoo he said to me i am come to take you back to natal
with a guard but i warn you to ask me no question for if you do i
must not answer them dingaan is ill and you cannot see him nor can
you see the white prayingman or anyon you must come with me at
onc
i do not want to see dingaan i repli look him in the ey
i understand answer kambula dingaan thought ar hi thought
and your thought ar your thought and perhap that is why he doe not
want to see you still rememb inkoo that dingaan ha save your
life snatch you unburn out of a veri great fire perhap becaus
you ar of a differ sort of wood which he think it a piti to burn
now if you ar readi let us go
i am readi i answer
at the gate i met naya who said
you never thought to sai goodby to me white man although i have
tend you well ah what els could i expect still i hope that if i
should have to fly from thi land for my life as mai chanc you will
do for me what i have done for you
that i will i answer shake her by the hand and as it happen
in after year i did
kambula led me not through the kraal umgungundhlovu but round it
our road lai immedi past the death mount hloma amabutu where the
vultur were still gather in great number inde it wa actual
my lot to walk over the newpick bone of some of my companion who
had been despatch at the foot of the hill on of these skeleton i
recognis by hi cloth to be that of samuel esterhuizen a veri
good fellow at whose side i had slept dure all our march hi empti
eyesocket seem to stare at me reproachfulli as though thei ask
me why i remain aliv when he and all hi brethren were dead i echo
the question in my own mind why of that great compani did i alon
remain aliv
an answer seem to rise within me that i might be on of the
instrument of vengeanc upon that devilish murder dingaan look
upon those poor shatter and desecr frame that had been men i
swore in my heart that if i live i would not fail in that mission nor
did i fail although the histori of that great repay cannot be told
in these page
turn my ey from thi dread sight i saw that on the opposit
slope where we had camp dure our southern trek from delagoa still
stood the hut and wagon of the reverend mr owen i ask kambula
whether he and hi peopl were also dead
no inkoo he answer thei ar of the children of georg as you
ar and therefor the king ha spare them although he is go to
send them out of the countri
thi wa good new so far as it went and i ask again if thoma
halstead had also been spare sinc he too wa an englishman
no said kambula the king wish to save him but he kill two of
our peopl and wa drag off with the rest when the slayer got to
their work it wa too late to stai their hand
again i ask whether i might not join mr owen and trek with him to
which kambula answer briefli
no macumazahn the king order ar that you must go by yourself
so i went nor did i ever again meet mr owen or ani of hi peopl i
believ howev that thei reach durban safe and sail awai in a
ship call the comet
in a littl while we came to the two milk tree by the main gate of the
kraal where much of our saddleri still lai scatter about though the
gun had gone here kambula ask me if i could recognis my own saddl
there it is i answer point to it but what is the us of a
saddl without a hors
the hors you rode ha been kept for you macumazahn he repli
then he order on of the men with us to bring the saddl and bridl
also some other articl which i select such as a coupl of blanket
a waterbottl two tin contain coffe and sugar a littl case of
medicin and so forth
about a mile further on i found on of my hors tether by an outli
guard hut and note that it had been well fed and care for by
kambula leav i saddl it and mount as i did so he warn me that
if i tri to ride awai from the escort i should certainli be kill
sinc even if i escap them order had been given throughout the land
to put an end to me should i be seen alon
i repli that unarm as i wa i had no idea of make ani such
attempt so we went forward kambula and hi soldier walk or
trot at my side
for four full dai we journei thu keep so far as i could judg
about twenti or thirti mile to the east of that road by which i had
left zululand befor and reenter it with retief and hi commiss
evid i wa an object of great interest to the zulu of the countri
through which we pass perhap becaus thei knew me to be the sole
survivor of all the white men who had gone up to visit the king thei
would come down in crowd from the kraal and stare at me almost with
aw as though i were a spirit and not a man onli not on of them
would sai anyth to me probabl becaus thei had been forbidden to do
so inde if i spoke to ani of them invari thei turn and walk
or ran out of hear
it wa on the even of the fourth dai that kambula and hi soldier
receiv some new which seem to excit them a great deal a messeng
in a state of exhaust who had an injuri to the fleshi part of hi
left arm which look to me as though it had been caus by a bullet
appear out of the bush and said someth of which by strain
my ear i caught two wordsgreat slaughter then kambula laid hi
finger on hi lip as a signal for silenc and led the man awai nor
did i see or hear ani more of him afterward i ask kambula who had
suffer thi great slaughter whereon he stare at me innoc and
repli that he did not know of what i wa speak
what is the us of ly to me kambula see that i shall find out
the truth befor long
then macumazahn wait till you do find it out and mai it pleas you
he repli and went off to speak with hi peopl at a distanc
all that night i heard them talk off and oni who lai awak
plung into new miseri i wa sure that some other dread thing had
happen probabl dingaan armi had destroi all the boer and if
so oh what had becom of mari wa she dead or had she perhap been
taken prison as dingaan had told me would be done for hi own vile
purpos for aught i knew she might now be travel under escort to
umgungundhlovu as i wa travel to natal
the morn came at last and that dai about noon we reach a ford
of the tugela which luckili wa quit passabl here kambula bade me
farewel sai that hi mission wa finish also he deliv to me
a messag that i wa to give from dingaan to the english in natal it
wa to thi effect that he dingaan had kill the boer who came to
visit him becaus he found out that thei were traitor to their chief
and therefor not worthi to live but that he love the son of georg
who were trueheart peopl and therefor had noth to fear from
him inde he beg them to come and see him at hi great place
where he would talk matter over with them
i said that i would deliv the messag if i met ani english peopl
but of cours i could not sai whether thei would accept dingaan
invit to umgungundhlovu inde i fear lest that town might
have acquir such a bad name that thei would prefer not to come there
without an armi
then befor kambula had time to take ani offenc i shook hi
outstretch hand and urg my hors into the stream i never met
kambula again live though after the battl of blood river i saw him
dead
onc over the tugela i rode forward for half a mile or so till i wa
clear of the bush and reed that grew down to the water fear lest
the zulu should follow and take me back to dingaan to explain my
rather imprud messag see no sign of them i halt a desol
creatur in a desol countri which i did not know wonder what i
should do and whither i should ride then it wa that there happen on
of the strangest experi of all my adventur life
as i sat dejectedli upon my hors which wa also deject amidst some
tumbl rock that at a distant period in the world histori had form
the bank of the great river i heard a voic which seem familiar to me
sai
baa is that you baa
i look round and could see no on so think that i had been
deceiv by my imagin i held my peac
baa said the voic again ar you dead or ar you aliv becaus
if you ar dead i dont want to have anyth to do with spook until i
am oblig
now i answer who is it that speak and whenc though realli as
i could see no on i thought that i must be dement
the next moment my hors snort and shi violent and no wonder for
out of a great antbear hole not five pace awai appear a yellow face
crown with black wool in which wa set a broken feather i look at
the face and the face look at me
han i said is it you i thought that you were kill with the
other
and i thought that you were kill with the other baa ar you
sure that you ar aliv
what ar you do there you old fool i ask
hide from the zulu baa i heard them on the other bank and then
saw a man on a hors cross the river and went to ground like a
jackal i have had enough of zulu
come out i said and tell me your stori
he emerg a thin and bedraggl creatur with noth left on him but
the upper part of a pair of old trouser but still han undoubtedli
han he ran to me and seiz my foot kiss it again and again
weep tear of joi and stutter
oh baa to think that i should find you who were dead aliv and
find myself aliv too oh baa never again will i doubt about the big
man in the sky of whom your reverend father is so fond for after i had
tri all our own spirit and even those of my ancestor and met with
noth but troubl i said the prayer that the reverend taught us
ask for my daili bread becaus i am so veri hungri then i look
out of the hole and there you were have you anyth to eat about you
baa
as it chanc in my saddlebag i had some biltong that i had save
against emerg i gave it to him and he devour it as a famish
hyena might do tear off the tough meat in lump and bolt them
whole when it wa all gone he lick hi finger and hi lip and stood
still stare at me
tell me your stori i repeat
baa i went to fetch the hors with the other and our had strai
i got up a tree to look for them then i heard a nois and saw that the
zulu were kill the boer so know that present thei would kill
us too i stop in that tree hide myself as well as i could in a
stork nest well thei came and assegai all the other totti and
stood under my tree clean their spear and get their breath for
on of my brother had given them a good run but thei never saw me
although i wa nearli sick from fear on the top of them inde i wa
sick but into the nest
well i sat in that nest all dai though the sun cook me like beef
on a stick and when night came i got down and ran for i knew it wa
no good to stop to look for you and everi man for himself when a black
devil is behind you as your reverend father sai all night i ran and
in the morn hid up in a hole then when night came again i went on
run oh thei nearli caught me onc or twice but never quit for
i know how to hide and i kept where men do not go onli i wa hungri
hungri ye i live on snail and worm and grass like an ox till
my middl ach still at last i got across the river and near to the
camp
then just befor the dai broke and i wa sai now han although
your heart is sad your stomach will rejoic and sing what did i see
but those zulu devil thousand of them rush down on the camp and kill
all the poor boer men and women and the littl children thei kill
them by the hundr till at last other boer came and drove them awai
although thei took all the cattl with them well as i wa sure that
thei would come back i did not stop there i ran down to the side of
the river and have been crawl about in the reed for dai live on
the egg of waterbird and a few small fish that i caught in the pool
till thi morn when i heard the zulu again and slip up here into
thi hole then you came and stood over the hole and for a long while i
thought you were a ghost
but now we ar togeth onc more and all is right just as what your
reverend father alwai said it would be with those who go to church on
sundai like me when there wa noth els to do and again he fell to
kiss my foot
han i said you saw the camp wa the missi mari there
baa how can i tell who never went into it but the wagon she slept
in wa not there no nor that of the vrouw prinsloo or of the heer
meyer
thank god i gasp then ad where were you try to get to
han when you ran awai from the camp
baa i thought perhap that the missi and the prinsloo and the
meyer had gone to that fine farm which you peg out and that i would
go and see if thei were there becaus if so i wa sure that thei would
be glad to know that you were realli dead and give me some food in
payment for my new but i wa afraid to walk across the open veld for
fear lest the zulu should see me and kill me therefor i came round
through the thick bush along the river where on can onli travel
slowli especi if hollow and he pat hi wast stomach
but han i ask ar we near my farm where i set the men to build
the hous on the hill abov the river
of cours baa ha your brain gone soft that you cannot find your wai
about the veld four or at most five hour on horseback ride slow
and you ar there
come on han i said and be quick for i think that the zulu ar
not far behind
so we start han hang to my stirrup and guid me for i knew
well enough that although he had never travel thi road hi instinct
for local would not betrai a colour man who can find hi wai
across the pathless veld as sure as a buck or a bird of the air
on we went over the roll plain and as we travel i told him my
stori briefli enough for my mind wa too torn with fear to allow me
to talk much he too told me more of hi escap and adventur now
i understood what wa that new which had so excit kambula and hi
soldier it wa evid that the zulu impi had destroi a great
number of the boer whom thei found unprepar for attack and then had
been driven off by reinforc that arriv from other camp
that wa why i had been kept prison for all those dai dingaan fear
lest i should reach natal in time to warn hi victim
chapter xx the courtmarti
on hour two hour three hour and then suddenli from the top of a
rise the sight of the beauti mooi river wind through the
plain like a vast snake of silver and there in a loop of it
the flatcrest koppi on which i had hope to make my home had
hopedwhi should i not still hope for aught i knew everyth might
yet be well mari might have escap the slaughter as i had done and
if so after all our troubl perchanc mani year of life and happi
await us onli it seem too good to be true
i flog my hors but the poor beast wa tire out and could onli
break into short canter that soon laps to a walk again but whether
it canter or whether it walk it hoof seem to beat out the
wordstoo good to be true sometim thei beat them fast and
sometim thei beat them slow but alwai their messag seem the same
han too wa outworn and weak from starvat also he had a cut upon
hi foot which hamper him so much that at last he said i had better go
on alon he would follow more slowli then i dismount and set him on
the hors walk by it myself
thu it came about that the gorgeou sunset wa finish and the sky had
grown grei with night befor we reach the foot of the koppi yet the
last rai of the sink orb had shown me someth as thei di there
on the slope of the hill stood some mud and wattl hous such as i had
order to be built and near to them sever whitecap wagon onli
i did not see ani smoke rise from those hous as there should have
been at thi hour of the dai when men cook their even food the
moon would be up present i knew but meanwhil it wa dark and the
tire hors stumbl and flounder among the stone which lai about at
the foot of the hill
i could bear it no longer
han i said do you stai here with the hors i will creep to the
hous and see if ani dwell there
be care baa he answer lest you should find zulu for those
black devil ar all about
i nod for i could not speak and then began the ascent for sever
hundr yard i crept from stone to stone feel my wai for the
kaffir path that led to the littl plateau where the spring wa abov
which the shanti stood ran at the other end of the hill i struck the
spruit or rivulet that wa fed by thi spring be guid to it by the
murmur of the water and follow up it bank till i heard a sound which
caus me to crouch and listen
i could not be sure becaus of the ceaseless babbl of the brook
but the sound seem like that of sob while i wait the great moon
appear suddenli abov a bank of inki cloud flood the place with
light and oh by that light look more ether than woman i sawi
saw mari
she stood not five pace from me by the side of the stream whither
she had come to draw water for she held a vessel in her hand she wa
cloth in some kind of a black garment such as widow wear but made
of rough stuff and abov it her face show white in the white rai
of the moon gaze at her from the shadow i could even see the tear
run down her cheek for it wa she who wept in thi lone place
wept for on who would return no more
my voic choke in my throat i could not utter a singl word rise
from behind a rock i move toward her she saw me and start then
said in a thrill whisper
oh husband ha god sent you to call me i am readi husband i am
readi and she stretch out her arm wildli let fall the vessel
that clank upon the ground
mari i gasp at length and at that word the blood rush to her
face and brow and i saw her draw in her breath as though to scream
hush i whisper it is i allan who have escap aliv
the next thing i rememb wa that she lai in my arm
what ha happen here i ask when i had told my tale or some of
it

out of the great slaughter for the zulu did not know where we had
gone and never follow us here although i have heard that thei sought
for me my father and my cousin hernan onli arriv at the camp two dai
after the attack and discov or guess our hidingplacei know

moment did not wish to listen to the poor fellow talk

cloud i had greet the vrouw prinsloo and all my other friend and
been receiv by them with raptur as on risen from the dead if thei

at hi side
it wa true there wa henri marai and just behind him talk into
hi ear rode hernan pereira i rememb that the two of them remind
me of a tale i had read about a man who wa curs with an evil geniu
that drew him to some dread doom in spite of the prompt of hi
better natur the thin worn wildei marai and the richfac
carnal pereira whisper slyli into hi ear thei were exact type of
that man in the stori and hi evil geniu who drag him down to hell

courtmarti had been arrang and that the six elder were the judg

actual perpetr of the terribl blunder that i am about to describ

pereira
allan quatermain said the command you ar brought here to be
tri by a courtmarti duli constitut accord to the law publish
in the camp of the emigr boer do you acknowledg that law
i know that there is such a law command i answer but i do not

boer but a subject of the queen of great britain
we have consid that point allan quatermain said the command
and we disallow it you will rememb that in the camp at bushman
river befor you rode with the late pieter retief to the chief
sikonyela when you were given command of the zulu who went with him

hold give thi court jurisdict over you
i deni your jurisdict i answer although it is true that i took
an oath to interpret faithfulli and i request that a note of my denial

true that through your evil do i who have lost my wife and three
children by the zulu spear have suffer enough to make me mad as for
the evid against you you shall hear it but first i will write down
that you plead not guilti
he did so then said
if you will acknowledg certain thing it will save us all much time
of which at present we have littl to spare those thing ar that
know what wa go to happen to the commiss you tri to avoid
accompani it is that true
no i answer i knew noth of what wa go to happen to the
commiss though i fear someth have but just save my friend
thereand i point to the prinsloosfrom death at the hand of
dingaan i did not wish to accompani it for anoth reason that i had
been marri on the dai of it start to mari marai still i went
after all becaus the gener retief who wa my friend ask me to
come to interpret for him
now some of the boer present said
that is true we rememb
but the command continu take no heed of my answer or these
interrupt
do you acknowledg that you were on bad term with henri marai and
with hernan pereira
ye i answer becaus henri marai did all in hi power to prevent
my marriag with hi daughter mari behav veri ill to me who had
save hi life and that of hi peopl who remain to him up by delagoa
and afterward at umgungundhlovu becaus too hernan pereira strove to
rob me of mari who love me moreov although i had save him when
he lai sick to death he afterward tri to murder me by shoot
me down in a lone place here is the mark of it and i touch the
littl scar upon the side of my forehead
that is true he did so the stinkcat shout the vrouw prinsloo and
wa order to be silent
do you acknowledg went on the command that you sent to warn
your wife and those with her to depart from the camp on the bushman
river becaus it wa go to be attack charg them to keep the
matter secret and that afterward both you and your hottentot servant
alon return safe from zululand where all those who went with you
lie dead
i acknowledg i answer that i wrote to tell my wife to come to
thi place where i had been build hous as you see and to bring
with her ani of our companion who care to trek here or fail that
to go alon thi i did becaus dingaan had told me whether in jest or
in earnest i did not know that he had given order that my said wife
should be kidnap as he desir to make her on of hi women have
thought her beauti when he saw her also what i did wa done with the
knowledg and by the wish of the late governor retief as can be shown
by hi write on my letter i acknowledg also that i escap when all
my brother were kill as did the hottentot han and if you wish to
know i will tell you how we escap and why
the command made a further note then he said
let the wit hernan pereira be call and sworn
thi wa done and he wa order to tell hi tale
as mai be imagin it wa a long tale and on that had evid been
prepar with great care i will onli set down it blackest falsehood
he assur the court that he had no enmiti against me and had never
attempt to kill me or do me ani harm although it wa true that hi
heart felt sore becaus against her father will i had stolen awai
the affect of hi betroth who wa now my wife he said that he had
stop in zululand becaus he knew that i should marri her as soon as
she came of ag and it wa too great pain for him to see thi done
he said that while he wa there befor the arriv of the commiss
dingaan and some of hi captain had told him that i had again and again
urg him dingaan to kill the boer becaus thei were traitor to the
sovereign of england but that he dingaan had refus to do so he
said that when retief came up with the commiss he tri to warn him
against me but that retief would not listen be infatu with me
as mani other were and he look toward the prinsloo
then came the worst of all he said that while he wa engag in
mend some gun for dingaan in on of hi privat hut he overheard
a convers between myself and dingaan which took place outsid the
hut i of cours not know that he wa within the substanc of
thi convers wa that i again urg dingaan to kill the boer and
afterward to send an impi to massacr their wive and famili onli
i ask him to give me time to get awai a girl whom i had marri from
among them and with her a few of my own friend whom i wish should
be spare as i intend to becom a kind of chief over them and if he
would grant it me to hold all the land of natal under hi rule and
the protect of the english to these propos dingaan answer
that thei seem wise and good and that he would think them over veri
carefulli
pereira said further that come out of the hut after dingaan had gone
awai he reproach me bitterli for my wicked and announc that he
would warn the boer which he did subsequ by word of mouth and in
write that thereon i caus him to be detain by the zulu while i
went to retief and told him some fals stori about him pereira which
caus retief to drive him out of hi camp and give order that none
of the boer should so much as speak to him that then he did the onli
thing he could go to hi uncl henri marai he told him not all
the truth but that he had learnt for certain that hi daughter mari
wa in dread danger of her life becaus of some intend attack of
the zulu and that all the boer among whom she dwelt were also in
danger of their live
therefor he suggest to henri marai that as the gener retief wa
besot and would not listen to hi stori the best thing thei could
do wa to ride awai and warn the boer thi then thei did secretli
without the knowledg of retief but be delai upon their journei by
on accid and anoth which he set out in detail thei onli reach
the bushman river too late after the massacr had taken place
subsequ as the command knew hear a rumour that mari marai
and other boer had trek to thi place befor the slaughter thei
came here and learn that thei had done so upon a warn sent to them
by allan quatermain whereon thei return and commun the new to
the surviv boer at bushman river
that wa all he had to sai
then as i reserv my crossexamin until i heard all the evid
against me henri marai wa sworn and corrobor hi nephew
testimoni on mani point as to my relat to hi daughter hi
object to my marriag to her becaus i wa an englishman whom he
dislik and mistrust and so forth he ad further that it wa true
pereira had told him he had sure inform that mari and the boer
were in danger from an attack upon them which had been arrang between
allan quatermain and dingaan that he also had written to retief and
tri to speak to him but wa refus a hear thereon he had ridden
awai from umgungundhlovu to try to save hi daughter and warn the boer
that wa all he had to sai
as there were no further wit for the prosecut i crossexamin
these two at full length but absolut without result sinc everi
vital question that i ask wa met with a direct neg
then i call my wit mari whose evid thei refus to hear
on the ground that she wa my wife and prejud the vrouw prinsloo
and her famili and the meyer on and all told a true stori of my
relat with hernan pereira henri marai and dingaan so far as thei
knew them
after thi as the command declin to take the evid of han
becaus he wa a hottentot and my servant i address the court
relat exactli what had taken place between me and dingaan and how i
and han came to escap on our second visit to hi kraal i point out
also that unhappili for myself i could not prove my word sinc dingaan
wa not avail as a wit and all the other were dead further
i produc my letter to mari which wa endors by retief and the
letter to retief sign by marai and pereira which remain in my
possess
by the time that i had finish my speech the sun wa set and
everyon wa tire out i wa order to withdraw under guard while
the court consult which it did for a long while then i wa call
forward again and the command said
allan quatermain after prayer to god we have consid thi case to
the best of our judgment and abil on the on hand we note that
you ar an englishman a member of a race which hate and ha alwai
oppress our peopl and that it wa to your interest to get rid of two
of them with whom you had quarrel the evid of henri marai and
hernan pereira which we cannot disbeliev show that you were wick
enough either in order to do thi or becaus of your malic against
the boer peopl to plot their destruct with a savag the result is
that some seven hundr men women and children have lost their live
in a veri cruel manner wherea you your servant your wife and your
friend have alon escap unharm for such a crime as thi a
hundr death could not pai inde god alon can give to it it
just punish and to him it is our duti to send you to be judg
we condemn you to be shot as a traitor and a murder and mai he have
merci on your soul
at these dread word mari fell to the ground faint and a paus
ensu while she wa carri off to the prinsloo hous whither the
vrouw follow to attend her then the command went on
still although we have thu pass judgment on you becaus you ar
an englishman against whom it might be said that we had prejudic
and becaus you have had no opportun of prepar a defenc and
no wit to the fact sinc all those whom you sai you could have
call ar dead we think it right that thi unanim sentenc of our
should be confirm by a gener court of the emigr boer therefor
tomorrow morn you will be taken with us to the bushman river camp
where the case will be settl and if necessari execut done in
accord with the verdict of the gener and veldcornet of that
camp meanwhil you will be kept in custodi in your own hous now have
you anyth to sai against thi sentenc
ye thi i answer that although you do not know it it is an
unjust sentenc built up on the li of on who ha alwai been my
enemi and of a man whose brain is rotten i never betrai the boer
if anyon betrai them it wa hernan pereira himself who as i prove
to the gener retief had been prai dingaan to kill me and whom
retief threaten to put upon hi trial for thi veri crime for which
reason and no other pereira fled from the kraal take hi tool henri
marai with him you have ask god to judg me well i ask god to
judg him and henri marai also and i know he will in on wai or
anoth as for me i am readi to die as i have been for month while
serv the caus of you boer shoot me now if you will and make an
end but i tell you that if i escap your hand i will not suffer thi
treatment to go unpunish i will lai my case befor the ruler of my
peopl and if necessari befor my queen ye if i have to travel to
london to do it and you boer shall learn that you cannot condemn an
innoc englishman upon fals testimoni and not pai the price i
tell you that price shall be great if i live and if i die it shall be
greater still
now these word veri foolish word i admit which be young and
inexperienc i spoke in my british pride i could see made a great
impress upon my judg thei believ to be fair to them that thei
had pass a just sentenc blind by prejudic and falsehood and
madden by the dread loss their peopl had suffer dure the
past few dai at the hand of a devilish savag thei believ that i
wa the instig of those loss on who ought to die inde all
or nearli all the boer were persuad that dingaan wa urg to thi
massacr by the counsel of englishmen the mere fact of my own and my
servant miracul escap when all my companion had perish
prove my guilt to them without the evid of pereira which be no
lawyer thei thought suffici to justifi their verdict
still thei had an uneasi suspicion that thi evid wa not
conclus and might inde be reject in toto by a more compet
court upon variou ground also thei knew themselv to be rebel who
had no legal right to form a court and fear the power of the long arm
of england from which for a littl while thei had escap if i were
allow to tell my tale to the parliament in london what might not
happen to them thei wonderedto them who had ventur to pass sentenc
of death upon a subject of the queen of great britain might not thi
turn the scale against them might not britain aris in wrath and crush
them these men who dare to invok her form of law in order to kill
her citizen those as i learn afterward were the thought that
pass through their mind
also anoth thought pass through their mindsthat if the sentenc
were execut at onc a dead man cannot appeal and that here i had
no friend to take up my caus and aveng me but of all thi thei
said noth onli at a sign i wa march awai to my littl hous and
imprison under guard
now i propos to tell the rest of the histori of these tragic event as
thei happen although some of them did not come to my knowledg till
the morrow or afterward for i think thi will be the more simpl and
the easier plan
chapter xxi the innoc blood
after i had been taken awai it seem that the court summon hernan
pereira and henri marai to accompani them to a lone spot at a
distanc where thei thought that their deliber would not be
overheard in thi howev thei were mistaken have forgotten the
foxlik cun of the hottentot han han had heard me sentenc
and probabl enough fear that he who also had commit the crime of
escap from dingaan might be call on to share that sentenc also
he wish to know the secret counsel of these boer whose languag of
cours he understood as well as he did hi own
so make a circuit up the hillsid he crept toward them on hi belli
as a snake creep wriggl in and out between the tuft of last year
dead grass which grew here in plenti without so much as move their
top at length he lai still in the centr of a bush that grew behind
a stone not five pace from where thei were talk whenc he listen
intent to everi word that pass their lip
thi wa the substanc of their talk that for the reason i have
alreadi mention it would be best that i should die at onc sentenc
said the command had been pass and could not be rescind sinc
even if it were their offenc would remain as heavi in the ey of
the english author but if thei took me to their main camp to
be retri by their great council possibl that sentenc might be
rescind and thei be left individu and collect to aton for
what thei had done also thei knew that i wa veri clever and might
escap in some other wai to bring the english or possibl the zulu
upon them sinc thei felt convinc that dingaan and i were work
togeth for their destruct and that while i had breath in my bodi i
should never ceas my effort to be aveng
when it wa found that thei were all of on mind in thi matter the
question aros what should be done somebodi suggest that i should be
shot at onc but the command point out that such a deed work
at night would look like murder especi as it violat the term of
their verdict
then anoth suggest wa made that i should be brought out of my
hous just befor the dawn on pretenc that it wa time to ride that
then i should be given the opportun of escap and instantli shot
down or it might be pretend that i had tri to escap with a like
result who thei urg wa to know in that halflight whether i had
or had not actual attempt to run for my life or to threaten their
live circumst under which the law said it wa justifi to
shoot a prison alreadi formal condemn to death
to thi black counsel thei all agre be so terribl afraid of a
poor english lad whose exist although most of them did not know
thi wa to be taken from him upon fals evid but then aros
anoth question by whose hand should the thing be done not on of
them it would seem wa anxiou to fulfil thi bloodi offic inde
thei on and all refus to do so a propos wa put forward that some
of their nativ servant should be forc to serv as execution
but when thi had been veto by the gener sens of the court their
counsel came to a deadlock
then after a whisper confer the command spoke some dread
word
hernando pereira and henri marai he said it is on your evid
that thi young man ha been condemn we believ that evid but
if by on jot or on tittl it is fals then not justic but a foul
murder will have been commit and hi innoc blood will be upon your
head for ever hernando pereira and henri marai the court appoint
you to be the guard who will bring the prison out of hi hous
tomorrow morn just when the sky begin to lighten it is from you
that he will try to escap and you will prevent hi escap by hi
death then you must join us where we shall be wait for you and
report the execut
when henri marai heard thi he exclaim
i swear by god that i cannot do it is it right or natur that a man
should be forc to kill hi own soninlaw
you could bear evid against your own soninlaw henri marai
answer the sternfac command why then cannot you kill with your
rifl on whom you have alreadi help to kill with your tongu
i will not i cannot said marai tear at hi beard but the
command onli answer coldli
you have the order of the court and if you choos to disobei them we
shall begin to believ that you have sworn fals then you and your
nephew will also appear befor the great council when the englishman
is tri again still it matter noth to us whether you or hernando
pereira shall fire the shot see you to it as the jew said to juda
who had betrai the innoc lord
then he paus and went on address pereira
do you also refus hernando pereira rememb befor you answer that
if you do refus we shall draw our own conclus rememb too that
the evid which you have given show that thi wick englishman
plot and caus the death of our brother and of our wive and
children which we believ to be true evid shall be weigh and
investig word by word befor the great council
to give evid is on thing and to shoot the traitor and murder
anoth said pereira then he ad with an oath or so vow han
yet why should i who know all thi villain guilt refus to carri
out the sentenc of the law on him have no fear command the
accurs allan quatermain shall not succe in hi attempt to escap
tomorrow befor the dawn
so be it said the command now do all you who have heard those
word take note of them
then han see that the council wa about to break up and fear
lest he should be caught and kill slip awai by the same road
that he had come hi thought wa to warn me but thi he could not
do becaus of the guard so he went to the prinsloo and find the
vrouw alon with mari who had recov her mind told them everyth
that he had heard
as he said mari knelt down and prai or thought for a long while
then rose and spoke
tant she said to the vrouw on thing is clear that allan will be
murder at the dawn now if he is hidden awai he mai escap
but where and how can we hide him ask the vrouw see that the
place is guard
tant said mari again at the back of your hous is an old cattl
kraal made by kaffir and in that cattl kraal as i have seen there
ar mealiepit where those kaffir store their grain now i suggest
that we should put my husband into on of those mealiepit and cover it
over there the boer might not find him howev close thei search
that is a good idea said the vrouw but how in the name of god ar
we to get allan out of a guard hous into a mealiepit
tant i have a right to go to my husband hous and there i will go
afterward too i shall have the right to leav hi hous befor he is
taken awai well he might leav it in my place as me and you and
han might help him then in the morn the boer would come to search
the hous and find no on except me
that is all veri pretti answer the vrouw but do you think my
niec that those accurs vultur will go awai until thei have pick
allan bone not thei for too much hang on it thei will know that
he cannot be far off and slink about the place until thei have found
him in hi mealiehol or until he come out it is blood thei ar
after thank to your cousin hernan the liar and blood thei will have
for their own safeti sake never will thei go awai from here until
thei see allan ly dead upon the ground
now accord to han mari thought again veri deepli then she
answer
there is a great risk tant but we must take it send your husband
to chat with those guard and give him a bottl of spirit i will talk
with han here and see what can be arrang
so mari went asid with han as he told me afterward and ask
him if he knew of ani medicin that made peopl sleep for a long while
without wake he answer ye all the colour peopl had plenti
of such medicin without doubt he could get some from the kaffir who
dwelt upon the place or if not he could dig the root of a plant that
he had seen grow near by which would serv the purpos so she sent
him to procur thi stuff afterward she spoke to the vrouw prinsloo
sai
my plan is that allan should escap from our hous disguis as myself
but as i know well that he will not run awai while he ha hi sens
see that to do so in hi mind would be to confess hi guilt i
propos to take hi sens from him by mean of a drug drink then
i propos that you and han should carri him into the shadow of thi
hous and when no on is look to the old grainpit that li but a
few yard awai cover the mouth of it with dead grass there he will
remain till the boer grow tire of search for him and ride awai or
if it should chanc that thei find him he will be no wors off than he
wa befor
a good plan enough mari though not on that allan would have
anyth to do with if he kept hi wit answer the vrouw see
that he wa alwai a man for face thing out although so young in
year still we will try to save him in spite of himself from the claw
of that stinkcat pereira whom mai god curs and hi tool your father
as you sai at the worst no harm will be done even if thei find him as
probabl thei will see that thei will not leav thi place without
blood
such then wa the trick which mari arrang with the vrouw prinsloo or
rather i should sai seem to arrang sinc she told her noth of
her real mind she who knew that the vrouw wa right and that for their
own sake as well as becaus thei believ it to be justic the boer
would never leav that place until thei saw blood run on the grass
thi oh thi wa mari true and dread planto give her life for
mine she wa sure that onc he had slain hi victim hernan pereira
would not stop to make examin of the corps he would ride awai
hound by hi guilti conscienc and meanwhil i could escap
she never thought the thing out in all it detail she who wa madden
with terror and had no time she onli felt her wai from step to step
dimli see my deliver at the end of the journei mari told the
vrouw prinsloo noth except that she propos to drug me if i would
not go undrug then the vrouw must hide me as best she could in the
grainpit or elsewher or if i had my sens about me let me hide
myself afterward she mari would face the boer and tell them to
find me if thei want me
the vrouw answer that she had now thought of a better plan it wa
that she should arrang with her husband and son and the meyer all
of whom love me that thei should rescu me or if need be kill or
disabl pereira befor he could shoot me
mari repli that thi wa good if it could be done and the vrouw
went out to find her husband and the other men present howev she
return with a long face sai that the command had them all
under guard it seem that it had occur to him or more probabl
to pereira that the prinsloo and the meyer who look on me as a
brother might attempt some rescu or make themselv formid in
other wai therefor as a matter of precaut thei had been put
under arrest and their arm taken from them as mine had been what the
command said howev wa that he took these somewhat highhand
measur in order to be sure that thei the prinsloo and the meyer
should be readi on the follow morn to ride with him and the
prison to the main camp where the great council might wish to
interrog them
on concess howev the vrouw had won from the command who
know what wa about to happen to me had not i suppos the heart to
refus it wa that my wife and she might visit me and give me food on
the stipul that thei both left the hous where i wa confin by
ten oclock that night
so it came to thi that if anyth wa to be done these two women
and a hottentot must do it sinc thei could hope for no help in their
plan here i should add that the vrouw told mari in hanss presenc
that she had thought of attack the command as to thi matter of my
propos shoot by pereira on reflect howev she refrain for
two reason first becaus she fear lest she might onli make matter
wors and rob me of my sole helper and secondli for fear lest she
should bring about the death of han to whom the stori would certainli
be trace
as he wa the solitari wit to the plot it seem to her that
he would scarc be allow to escap to repeat it far and wide
especi wa thi so as the unexplain death of a hottentot
suspect of treacheri like hi master wa not a matter that would have
been thought worth notic in those rough and bloodi time she mai have
been right or she mai have been wrong but in weigh her decis it
must alwai be born in mind that she wa and until the end remain
in utter ignor of mari heroic design to go to her death in place
of me
so the two women and the hottentot proceed to matur the plan which i
have outlin on other altern howev han did suggest it wa
that thei should try to drug the guard with some of the medic drink
that wa meant for me and that then mari i and he should slip awai
and get down to the river there to hide in the weed thenc perhap
we might escap to port natal where live englishmen who would protect
us
of cours thi idea wa hopeless from the first the moonlight wa
almost as bright as dai and the veld quit open for a long wai round
so that we should certainli have been seen and recaptur which of
cours would have meant instant death further as it happen the
guard had been warn against touch liquor of ani sort sinc it wa
thought probabl that an attempt would be made to intox them still
the women determin to try thi scheme if thei could find a chanc at
least it wa a second string to their bow
meanwhil thei made their prepar han went awai for a littl and
return with a suppli of hi sleepproduc drug though whether he
got thi from the kaffir or gather it himself i do not rememb if
i ever heard at ani rate it wa boil up in the water with which thei
made the coffe that i wa to drink though not in that which mari
propos to drink with me the strong tast and black hue of the coffe
effectu hide ani flavour or colour that there might be in the
herb also the vrouw cook some food which she gave to han to carri
first howev he went to investig the old mealiepit which wa
within a few pace of the back door of the prinsloo hous he report
that it would do well to hide a man in especi as tall grass and
bush grew about it mouth
then the three of them start and arriv at the door of my hous
which wa about a hundr yard awai were of cours challeng by the
sentri
heeren said mari the command ha given us leav to bring
food to my husband whom you guard within prai do not prevent us from
enter
no answer on of them gentli enough for he wa touch with piti
at her plight we have our order to admit you the vrouw prinsloo and
the nativ servant though why three of you should be need to carri
food to on man i dont know i should have thought that at such a time
he would have prefer to be alon with hi wife
the vrouw prinsloo wish to ask my husband certain question about hi
properti here and what is to be done while he and her men ar awai at
the main camp for the second trial as i whose heart is full of sorrow
have no head for such thing also the hottentot must have order as
to where he is to get a hors to ride with him so prai let us pass
mynheer
veri good it is no affair of our vrouw quatermain stai i suppos
that you have no arm under that long cloak of your
search me if you will mynheer she answer open the cloak
whereon after a quick glanc he nod and bade them enter sai
mind you ar to come out by ten oclock you must not pass the night
in that hous or we shall have the littl englishman oversleep
himself in the morn
then thei enter and found me seat at a tabl prepar note for

grew strang sleepi the last thing i rememb wa mari look at me
with her beauti ey that were fullah so full of tender love and
kiss me again and again upon the lip
i dream all sort of dream rather pleasant dream on the whole
then i woke up by degre to find myself in an earthen pit shape like a
bottl and have the remain of polish side to it it made me think
of josph who wa let down by hi brethren into a well in the desert
now who on earth could have let me down into a well especi as i
had no brethren perhap i wa not realli in a well perhap thi wa
a nightmar or i might be dead i began to rememb that there were
certain good reason why i should be dead onli onlywhi should thei
have buri me in woman cloth as i seem to wear
and what wa that nois that had waken me
it could not be the trump of doom unless the trump of doom went off
like a doublebarrel gun
i began to try to climb out of my hole but as it wa nine feet deep and
bottleshap which the light flow in from the neck show i found
thi imposs just as i wa give up the attempt a yellow face
appear in that neck which look to me like the face of han and an
arm wa project downward

hansand i will pull you out
so i jump and caught the arm abov the wrist then the owner of
the arm pull desper and the end of it wa that i succeed in
grip the edg of the bottlelik hole and with the help of the
arm in drag myself out
now baa said han for it wa han run run befor the boer

pace awai wa mari and my own there seem to be someth go

necess of my run awai but i would not be drag inde i
struck at him until at last with an exclam of despair he let go
of me and vanish
so i went on alon i came to my hous or what i thought resembl
it and there saw a figur ly on it face on the ground some ten or
fifteen yard to the right of the doorwai and note abstractedli that
