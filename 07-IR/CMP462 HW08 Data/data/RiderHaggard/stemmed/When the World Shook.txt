when the world shook
chapter i arbuthnot describ himself
i suppos that i humphrei arbuthnot should begin thi histori in
which destini ha caus me to plai so promin a part with some short
account of myself and of my circumst
i wa born forti year ago in thi veri devonshir villag in which i
write but not in the same hous now i live in the priori an ancient
place and a fine on in it wai with it panel room it beauti
garden where in thi mild climat in addit to our own flourish
so mani plant which on would onli expect to find in countri that
lie nearer to the sun and it green undul park stud with great
timber tree the view too is perfect behind and around the rich
devonshir landscap with it hill and vallei and it scarp face
of red sandston and at a distanc in front the sea there ar littl
town quit near too that live for the most part on visitor but these
ar so hidden awai by the contour of the ground that from the priori
on cannot see them such is fulcomb where i live though for obviou
reason i do not give it it real name
mani year ago my father the rev humphrei arbuthnot whose onli child
i am after whom also i am name humphrei wa the vicar of thi place
with which our famili is said to have some rather vagu hereditari
connect if so it wa sever in the carolian time becaus my
ancestor fought on the side of parliament
my father wa a reclus and a widow for my mother a scotswoman
di at or shortli after my birth be veri high church for those
dai he wa not popular with the famili that own the priori befor me
inde it head a somewhat vulgar person of the name of enfield who had
made monei in trade almost persecut him as he wa in a posit to
do be the local magnat and the owner of the rectori tith
i mention thi fact becaus ow to it as a boi i made up my mind that
on dai i would bui that place and sit in hi seat a wild enough idea
at the time yet it becam engrain in me as do such aspir of
our youth and when the opportun aros in after year i carri
it out poor old enfield he fell on evil fortun for in try to
bolster up a favourit son who wa a gambler a spendthrift and an
ungrat scamp in the end he wa practic ruin and when the
bad time came wa forc to sell the fulcomb estat i think of him
kindli now for after all he wa good to me and gave me mani a dai
shoot and leav to fish for trout in the river
by the poor peopl howev of all the district round for the parish
itself is veri small my father wa much belov although he did
practis confess wear vestment and set light candl on the
altar and wa even said to have openli express the wish to which
howev he never attain that he could see a censer swing in the
chancel inde the church which as monk built it is veri larg and
fine wa alwai full on sundai though mani of the worshipp came
from far awai some of them doubtless out of curios becaus of it
papist reput also becaus in a learn fashion my father
preach wa veri good inde
for my part i feel that i ow much to these highchurch view thei
open certain door to me and taught me someth of the mysteri
which lie at the back of all religion and therefor have their home
in the inspir soul of man whenc religion ar born onli the piti
is that in ninetynin case out of a hundr he never discov never
even guess at that entomb aspir never sink a shaft down on to
thi secret but most preciou vein of or
i have said that my father wa learn but thi is a mild descript
for never did i know anyon quit so learn he wa on of those
men who is so good all round that he becam preemin in noth a
classic of the first water a veri respect mathematician an expert
in theologi a student of sundri foreign languag and literatur in
hi lighter moment an inquir into sociolog a theoret musician
though hi plai of the organ excruci most peopl becaus it wa
too correct a realli firstclass author upon flint instrument and
the best grower of garden veget in the counti also of applessuch
were some of hi attain that wa what made hi sermon so popular
sinc at time on or the other of these subject would break out into
them hi theori be that god spoke to us through all of these thing
but if i began to drift into an analysi of my father abil i
should never stop it would take a book to describ them and yet mark
thi with them all hi name is as dead to the world todai as though he
had never been light reflect from a hundr facet dissip itself
in space and is lost that concentr in on tremend rai pierc to
the star
now i am go to be frank about myself for without frank what
is the valu of such a record as thi then it becom simpli anoth
convent or rather convent method of express the octoroon
kind of truth with which the highli civilis race feed themselv
as fastidi ladi eat cake and bread from which all but the smallest
particl of nourish ha been extract
the fact is therefor that i inherit most of my father abil
except hi love for flint instrument which alwai bore me to
distract becaus although thei ar by associ realli the most
human of thing somehow to me thei never convei ani idea of human
in addit i have a practic side which he lack had he possess it
sure he must have becom an archbishop instead of dy the vicar of
an unknown parish also i have a spiritu sens mayhap mystic would
be a better term which with all thi religion wa miss from my
father natur
for i think that notwithstand hi chariti and devot he never quit
got awai from the shell of thing never crack it and set hi teeth in
the kernel which alon can feed our soul hi keen intellect to take
an exampl recognis everi on of the difficulti of our faith and
flash hither and thither in the dark seek explan seek
light try to reconcil to explain he wa not great enough to
put all thi asid and go straight to the inform soul beneath that
strive to express itself everywher even through those husk which ar
call the world the flesh and the devil and as yet doe not alwai
quit succe
it is thi boggl over exterior thi peer into pitfal thi
desir to prove that what such sens as we have tell us is imposs
is in fact possibl which caus the overthrow of mani an earnest
seek heart and render it work conduct on fals line quit
nugatori these will trust to themselv and their own intellig and
not be content to spring from the cliff of human experi into the
everlast arm of that infinit which ar stretch out to receiv
them and to give them rest and the kei of knowledg when will man
learn what wa taught to him of old that faith is the onli plank
wherewith he can float upon thi sea and that hi miser work avail
him noth also that it is a plank made of mani sort of wood perhap
to suit our differ weight
so to be honest in a sens i believ myself to be my father superior
and i know that he agre with me perhap thi is ow to the blood
of my scotch mother which mix well with hi own perhap becaus the
essenti spirit given to me though cast in hi mould wa in fact
quit differentor of anoth alloi do we i wonder realli understand
that there ar million and billion of these alloi so mani inde
that natur or whatev is behind natur never us the same twice
over that is why no two human be ar or ever will be quit
ident their flesh the bodi of their humili is ident in
all ani chemist will prove it to you but that which anim the
flesh is distinct and differ becaus it come from the home of that
infinit varieti which is necessari to the ultim evolut of the
good and bad that we symbolis as heaven and hell
further i had and to a certain extent still have anoth advantag
over my father which certainli came to me from my mother who wa as
i judg from all descript and such like as remain of her an
extrem handsom woman i wa born much better look he wa small
and dark a littl man with deepset ey and beetl brow i am also
dark but tall abov the averag and well made i do not know that i
need sai more about my person appear to me not a veri attract
subject but the fact remain that thei call me handsom humphrei
at the univers and i wa the captain of my colleg boat and won mani
prize at athlet sport when i had time to train for them
until i went up to oxford my father educ me partli becaus he knew
that he could do it better than anyon els and partli to save school
expens the experi wa veri success as my love of all outdoor
sport and of ani small hazard adventur that came to my hand also
of associ with fisherfolk whom the danger of the deep make men
among men save me from becom a milksop for the rest i learn more
from my father whom i alwai desir to pleas becaus i love him
than i should have done at the best and most costli of school thi wa
shown when at last i went to colleg with a scholarship for there i did
veri well inde as search would still reveal
here i had better set out some of my shortcom which in their sum
have made a failur of me ye a failur in the highest sens though
i trust what stevenson call a faith failur these have their root
in fastidi and that lack of persever which realli mean a
lack of faith again us the word in it higher and wider sens for
if on had real faith on would alwai persever know that in everi
work undertaken with high aim there is an element of nobil howev
humbl and unrecognis that work mai seem to be god after all is the
god of work it is written larg upon the face of the univers i will
not expand upon the thought it would lead me too far afield but those
who have understand will know what i mean
as regard what i interpret as fastidi thi is not veri easi
to express perhap a definit will help i am like a man with an
overdevelop sens of smell who when walk through a foreign citi
howev clean and well kept can alwai catch the evil savour that
ar insepar from such citi more hi keen percept of them
interfer with all other percept and spoil hi walk the result
is that in after year whenev he think of that beauti citi
he rememb not it histor build or it wide boulevard or
whatev it ha to boast but rather it ancient fishlik smell at
least he rememb that first ow to thi defect in hi tempera
so it is with everyth a love woman is spoil for such a on
becaus she eat too much or ha too high a voic he doe not care for
hi shoot becaus the sceneri is flat or for hi fish becaus
the gnat bite as well as the trout in short he is out of tune with
the world as it is moreov thi is a qualiti which where it exist
cannot be overcom it affect daylabour as well as gentlemen at
larg it is bred in the bone
probabl the second failurebreed fault lack of persever ha
it root in the first at ani rate in my case at least on leav
colleg with some reput i wa call to the bar where ow to
certain solicitor and other connect i had a good open also
ow to the excel of my memori and power of work i began veri
well make monei even dure my first year then as it happen a
certain case came my wai and my leader fall ill suddenli after it
wa open wa left in my hand the man whose caus i wa plead
wa i think on of the biggest scoundrel it is possibl to conceiv
it wa a will case and if he won the effect would be to beggar two most
estim middleag women who were justli entitl to the properti
to which end person i am convinc he had commit forgeri the
perjuri that accompani it i do not even mention
well he did win thank to me and the estim middleag ladi
were beggar and as i heard afterward driven to such extrem
that on of them di of her miseri and the other becam a lodginghous
keeper the detail do not matter but i mai explain that these ladi
were unattract in appear and manner and broke down beneath my
crossexamin which made them appear to be tell falsehood
wherea thei were onli complet confus further i invent an
ingeni theori of the fact which although the judg regard it with
suspicion convinc an unusu stupid juri who gave me their verdict
everybodi congratul me and at the time i wa triumphant especi
as my leader had declar that our case wa imposs afterward
howev my conscienc smote me sore so much so that argu from
the fals premis of thi busi i came to the conclus that the
practic of the law wa not suit to an honest man i did not take the
larg view that such matter averag themselv up and that if i had
done harm in thi instanc i might live to do good in mani other and
perhap becom a just judg even a great judg here i mai mention that
in after year when i grew rich i rescu that surviv old ladi from
her lodginghous although to thi dai she doe not know the name of
her anonym friend so by degre without sai anyth for i kept
on my chamber i slip out of practic to the great disappoint
of everybodi connect with me and took to authorship
a marvel came to pass my first book wa an enorm success the whole
world talk of it a lead journal delight to have discov
someon wrote it up other journal follow suit to be in the
movement on of them i rememb which had alreadi dismiss it with
three or four sneer line came out with a second and twocolumn
notic it sold like wildfir and i suppos had some merit for it is
still read though few know that i wrote it sinc fortun it wa
publish under a pseudonym
again i wa much elat and set to work to write anoth and as i
believ a much better book but jealousi had been excit by thi
leap into fame of a total unknown person which were moreov
accentu through a foolish articl that i publish in answer to some
critic wherein i spoke my mind with an insan freedom and bite
sarcasm inde i wa even mad enough to quot name and to give the
exampl of the veri power journal which at first carp at my work
and then gush over it when it becam the fashion all of thi made me
mani bitter enemi as i found out when my next book appear
it wa torn to shred it wa revil as subvers of moral
and religion good arrow in those dai it wa call pueril
halfeduc stuffi halfeduc more an utterli fals charg of
plagiar wa cook up against me and so well and venom run that
vast number of peopl conclud that i wa a thief of the lowest order
lastli my father from whom the secret could no longer be kept sternli
disapprov of both these book which i admit were written from a veri
radic and somewhat antichurch point of view the result wa our first
quarrel and befor it wa made up he di suddenli
now again fastidi and my lack of persever did their work and
solemnli i swore that i would never write anoth book an oath which i
have kept till thi moment at least so far as public is concern
and now break onli becaus i consid it my duti so to do and am not
anim by ani pecuniari object
thu came to an end my second attempt at carv out a career by now
i had grown savag and cynic rather reveng also i fear know
myself to possess consider abil in sundri direct i sat
down as it were to think thing over and digest my past experi
then it wa that the truth of a veri ancient adag struck upon my mind
name that monei is power had i suffici monei i could laugh at
unjust critic for exampl inde thei or their paper would scarc
dare to criticis me for fear lest it should be in my power to do them
a bad turn again i could follow my own idea in life and perhap work
good in the world and live in such surround as commend themselv
to me it wa as clear as daylight buthow to make the monei
i had some capit as the result of my father death about 8000 in
all plu a littl more that my two book had brought in in what wai
could i emploi it to the best advantag i rememb that a cousin of
my father and therefor my own wa a success stockbrok also
that there had been some affect between them i went to him he wa
a good easynatur man who wa frankli glad to see me and offer to
put 5000 into hi busi for i wa not mind to risk everi thing i
had if he would give me a share in the profit he laugh heartili at
my audac
why my boi he said be total inexperienc at thi game you
might lose us more than that in a month but i like your courag i like
your courag and the truth is that i do want help i will think it over
and write to you
he thought it over and in the end offer to try me for a year at a
fix salari with a promis of some kind of a partnership if i suit
him meanwhil my 5000 remain in my pocket
i accept not without reluct sinc with the impati of youth
i want everyth at onc i work hard in that offic and soon
master the busi for my knowledg of figuresi had taken a
firstclass mathemat degre at collegecam to my aid as in a wai
did my acquaint with law and literatur moreov i had a certain
aptitud for what is call high financ further fortun as usual
show me a favour face
in on year i got the partnership with a small share in the larg
profit of the busi in two the partner abov me retir and i took
hi place with a third share of the firm in three my cousin satisfi
that it wa in abl hand began to ceas hi attend at the offic
and betook himself to garden which wa hi hobbi in four i paid him
out altogeth although to do thi i had to borrow monei on our credit
for by agreement the titl of the firm wa continu then came that
extraordinari time of boom which mani will rememb to their cost i
made a bold stroke and won on a certain saturdai when the book were
made up i found that after discharg all liabil i should not
be worth more than 20000 on the follow saturdai but two when the
book were made up i wa worth 153000 lappetit vient en mangeant
it seem noth to me when so mani were worth million
for the next year i work as few have done and when i struck a balanc
at the end of it i found that on the most conserv estim i wa
the owner of a million and a half in hard cash or it equival i wa
so tire out that i rememb thi discoveri did not excit me at all i
felt utterli weari of all wealthhunt and of the citi and it wai
moreov my old fastidi and lack of persever reassert
themselv i reflect rather late in the dai perhap on the
ruin that thi specul wa bring to thousand of which some
lament instanc had recent come to my notic and onc more
consid whether it were a suitabl career for an upright man i had
wealth why should i not take it and enjoi life
alsoand here my busi acumen came in i wa sure that these time
could not last it is easi to make monei on a rise market but when
it is fall the matter is veri differ in five minut i made up
my mind i sent for my junior partner for i had taken in two and told
them that i intend to retir at onc thei were dismai both at my
loss for realli i wa the firm and becaus as thei point out if
i withdrew all my capit there would not be suffici left to enabl
them to carri on
on of them a blunt and honest man said to my face that it would be
dishonour of me to do so i wa inclin to answer him sharpli then
rememb that hi word were true
veri well i said i will leav you 600000 on which you shall pai
me five per cent interest but no share of the profit
on these term we dissolv the partnership and in a year thei had
lost the 600000 for the slump came with a vengeanc it save them
howev and todai thei ar earn a reason incom but i have
never ask them for that 600000
chapter ii bastin and bicklei
behold me onc more a man without an occup but now the possessor
of about 900000 it wa a veri consider fortun if not a larg
on in england noth like the million of which i had dream but
still enough to make the most of it and to be sure that it remain i
invest it veri well mostli in larg mortgag at four per cent which
if the secur is good do not depreci in capit valu never again
did i touch a singl specul stock who desir to think no more
about monei it wa at thi time that i bought the fulcomb properti
it cost me about 120000 of my capit or with alter repair
etc sai 150000 on which sum it mai pai a net two and a half per
cent not more
thi 3700 odd i have alwai devot to the upkeep of the place which
is therefor in firstrat order the rest i live on or save
these arrang with the beautifi and furnish of the hous
and the restor of the church in memori of my father occupi and
amus me for a year or so but when thei were finish time began to
hang heavi on my hand what wa the us of possess about 20000 a
year when there wa noth upon which it could be spent for after
all my own want were few and simpl and the acquisit of valuabl
pictur and costli furnitur is limit by space oh in my small wai
i wa like the weari king ecclesiast for i too made me great work
and had possess of great and small cattl i tri farm and
lost monei over it and gather me silver and gold and the peculiar
treasur of king which i presum mean whatev a man in author
chiefli desir and so forth but behold all wa vaniti and vexat
of spirit and there wa no profit under the sun
so notwithstand my wealth and health and the defer which is
the rich man portion especi when the limit of hi rich is not
known it came about that i too hate life and thi when i wa not
much over thirti i did not know what to do for societi as the word
is gener understood i had no tast it bore me horserac and
card i loath who had alreadi gambl too much on a big scale the
kill of creatur under the name of sport pall upon me inde i
began to doubt if it were right while the offic of a junior counti
magistr in a place where there wa no crime onli occupi me an hour
or two a month
lastli my neighbour were few and with all due defer to them
extrem dull at least i could not understand them becaus in them
there did not seem to be anyth to understand and i am quit certain
that thei did not understand me more when thei came to learn that i
wa radic in my view and had written certain dread and
somewhat socialist book in the form of fiction thei both fear and
mistrust me as an enemi to their particular section of the race as
i had not marri and show no inclin to do so their womenkind
also out of their intim knowledg proclaim that i led an immor
life though a littl reflect would have shown them that there wa
no on in the neighbourhood which for a time i seldom left who could
possibl have tempt an educ creatur to such cours
terribl is the lot of a man who while still young and possess the
intellect necessari to achiev is depriv of all ambit and
i had none at all i did not even wish to purchas a peerag or a
baronetci in thi fashion or in that and as in my father case my
tast were so mani and so cathol that i could not lose myself in ani
on of them thei never becam more than divers to me a hobbi is
onli realli amus when it becom an obsess
at length my lonesom friendless oppress me so much that i took
step to mitig it in my colleg life i had two particular friend
whom i think i must have select becaus thei were so absolut
differ from myself
thei were name bastin and bicklei bastinbasil wa hi christian
namewa an uncouth shockhead flatfoot person of larg rug
frame and equal rug honesti with a mind almost incred simpl
noth surpris him becaus he lack the faculti of surpris he wa
like that kind of fish which li at the bottom of the sea and take
everi kind of food into it great maw without distinguish it
flavour metaphor speak heavenli manna and decai cabbag
were just the same to bastin he wa not fastidi and both were mental
pabulumof a sorttogeth with whatev lai between these extrem
yet he wa good so painfulli good that on felt that without exert
to himself he had book a firstclass ticket straight to heaven inde
that hi guardian angel had ti it round hi neck at birth lest he
should lose it alreadi number and date like an identif disc
i am bound to add that bastin never went wrong becaus he never felt the
slightest temptat to do so thi i suppos constitut real virtu
sinc in view of certain bibl sai the person who is tempt and
would like to yield to the temptat is equal a sinner with the
person who doe yield to be truli good on should be too good to be
tempt or too weak to make the effort worth the tempter whilein
short not deserv of hi powder and shot
i need hardli add that bastin went into the church inde he could not
have gone anywher els it absorb him natur as doubtless heaven
will do in due cours onli i think it like that until thei get to
know him he will bore the angel so much that thei will continu move
him up higher also if thei have ani suscept left probabl
he will tread upon their toesan art in which i never knew hi equal
howev i alwai love bastin perhap becaus no on els did a fact
of which he remain total unconsci or perhap becaus of hi
brutal wai of tell on what he conceiv to be the truth which as
he had less imagin than a dormous gener it wa not for if
the truth is a jewel it is on colour and veil by mani differ
light and atmospher
it onli remain to add that he wa learn in hi theolog fashion
and that among hi further peculiar were the slow monoton
voic in which he utter hi view in long sentenc and hi total
indiffer to advers argument howev sound and convinc
my other friend bicklei wa a person of a quit differ charact
like bastin he wa learn but hi tendenc face anoth wai
if bastin omnivor throat could swallow a camel especi
a theolog camel bicklei would strain at the smallest gnat
especi a theolog gnat the veri best and most upright of men
yet he believ in noth that he could not tast see or handl he
wa convinc for instanc that man is a brutedescend accid and
no more that what we call the soul or the mind is produc by a certain
action of the grei matter of the brain that everyth appar
inexplic ha a perfectli mundan explan if onli on could find
it that miracl certainli never did happen and never will that all
religion ar the fruit of human hope and fear and the most convinc
proof of human weak that notwithstand our infinit variat we
ar the subject of natur singl law and the victim of blind black
and brutal chanc
such wa bicklei with hi clever wellcut face that alwai remind
me of a cameo and thought brow hi strong capabl hand and hi
rather steeli mouth the mere set of which suggest controversi of
an uncompromis kind natur as the church had claim bastin so
medicin claim bicklei
now as it happen the man who succeed my father as vicar of fulcomb
wa given a better live and went awai shortli after i had purchas
the place and with it the advowson just at thi time also i receiv
a letter written in the larg sprawl hand of bastin from whom i
had not heard for year it went straight to the point sai that he
bastin had seen in a church paper that the last incumb had resign
the live of fulcomb which wa in my gift he would therefor be
oblig if i would give it to him as the place he wa at in yorkshir
did not suit hi wife health
here i mai state that afterward i learn that what did not suit mr
bastin wa the organist who wa pretti she wa by natur a woman
with a tempera so insan jealou that actual she manag to be
suspici of bastin whom she had captur in an unguard moment when
he wa think of someth els and who would as soon have thought of
even look at ani woman as he would of worship baal as a matter
of fact it took him month to know on femal from anoth except as
possibl provid of subscript and prop of mother meet
women had no interest for him
to returnwith that engag honesti which i have mentionedbastin
letter went on to set out all hi own disabl which he ad
would probabl render him unsuit for the place he desir to fill
he wa a high churchman a fact which would certainli offend mani he
had no claim to be a preacher although he wa extraordinarili well
acquaint with the write of the earli father what on earth had
that to do with the question i wonder on the other hand he had
gener been consid a good visitor and wa fond of walk he
meant to call on distant parishion but did not sai so
then follow a page and a half on the evil of the exist system
of the present to live by privat person end with the
suggest that i had probabl commit a sin in bui thi particular
advowson in order to increas my local author that is if i had
bought it a point on which he wa ignor final he inform me that
as he had to christen a sick babi five mile awai on a certain moor
and it wa too wet for him to ride hi bicycl he must stop and he
stop
there wa howev a ps to the letter which ran as follow
someon told me that you were dead a few year ago and of cours it
mai be anoth man of the same name who own fulcomb if so no doubt
the post offic will send back thi letter
that wa hi onli allus to my humbl self in all those diffus page
it wa a long while sinc i had receiv an epistl which made me laugh
so much and of cours i gave him the live by return of post and
even inform him that i would increas it stipend to a sum which i
consid suitabl to the posit
about ten dai later i receiv anoth letter from bastin which as
a scrawl on the flap of the envelop inform me he had carri for
a week in hi pocket and forgotten to post except by infer it
return no thank for my intend benefit what it did sai howev
wa that he thought it wrong of me to have settl a matter of such
spiritu import in so great a hurri though he had observ that
rich men were nearli alwai selfish where their time wa concern
moreov he consid that i ought first to have made inquiri as to
hi present charact and attain etc etc
to thi epistl i repli by telegraph to the effect that i should as
soon think of make inquiri about the charact of an archangel
or that of on of hi high church saint thi telegram he told me
afterward he consid unseemli and even ribald especi as it had
given great offenc to the postmast who wa on of the sidesmen in
hi church
thu it came about that i appoint the rev basil bastin to the
live of fulcomb feel sure that he would provid me with endless
amus and act as a moral tonic and disciplin also i appreci
the man blunt candour in due cours he arriv and i confess that
after a few sundai of experi i began to have doubt as to the
wisdom of my choic glad as i wa to see him person hi sermon at
onc bore me and when thei did not send me to sleep excit in me
a desir for debat how could he be so profoundli acquaint with
mysteri befor which the world had stood amaz for ag wa there
noth too hot or too heavi in the spiritu wai for him to dismiss in
a few blunder and casual word as he might ani ordinari incid of
everydai life i wonder also hi idea of high church observ wa
not mine or i imagin that of anybodi els but i will not attempt to
set it out
hi peculiar howev were easi to excus and entir swallow
up by the innat good of hi natur which soon made him belov of
everyon in the place for although he thought that probabl most thing
were sin i never knew him to discov a sin which he consid to be
beyond the reach of forgiv bastin wa inde a most charit man
and in hi wai widemind
the person whom i could not toler howev wa hi wife who to
my fanci more resembl a vessel a veri unattract vessel full of
vinegar than a woman her name wa sarah and she wa small plain flat
sandyhair and odiou quit obsess moreov with her jealousi
of the rev basil at whom it pleas her to suppos that everi woman in
the countrysid under fifti wa throw herself
here i will confess that to the best of my abil i took care that thei
did in outward seem that is whenev she wa present instruct
them to sit asid with him in darken corner to present him with
flower and so forth sever of them easili fell into the humour of
the thing and i have seen him depart from a dinnerparti follow by
that glower sarah with a hand of rosebud and violet to sai
noth of the tradit offer of slipper embroid marker
and the like well it wa my onli wai of come even with her which i
think she knew for she hate me poison
so much for basil bastin now for bicklei him i had met on sever
occas sinc our colleg dai and after i wa settl at the priori
from time to time i ask him to stai with me at length he came and
i found out that he wa not at all comfort in hi london practic
which wa of a natur uncongeni to him further that he did not get
on with hi partner then after reflect i made a suggest
to him i point out that ow to it popular amongst seasid
visitor the neighbourhood of fulcomb wa a rise on and that
although there were doctor in it there wa no realli firstclass
surgeon for mile
now bicklei wa a firstclass surgeon have held veri high hospit
appoint and inde still hold them why i ask should he
not come and set up here on hi own i would appoint him doctor to
the estat and also give him charg of a cottag hospit which i wa
endow with liberti to build and arrang it as he like further as
i consid that it would be of great advantag to me to have a man of
real abil within reach i would guarante for three year whatev
incom he wa earn in london
he thank me warmli and in the end act on the idea with startl
result so far as hi prospect were concern veri soon hi realli
remark skill becam known and he wa earn more monei than as an
unmarri man he could possibl want inde scarc a big oper
took place at ani town within twenti mile and even much farther awai
at which he wa not call in to assist
needless to sai hi advent wa a great boon to me for as he live in a
hous i let him quit near by whenev he had a spare even he would
drop in to dinner and from our absolut opposit standpoint we
discuss all thing human and divin thu i wa enabl to sharpen
my wit upon the hard steel of hi clear intellect which wa yet in a
sens so limit
i must add that i never convert him to my wai of think and he
never convert me to hi ani more than he convert bastin for
whom queerli enough he had a like thei pound awai at each other
bicklei frequent get the best of it in the argument and when at
last bastin rose to go he gener made the same remark it wa
it realli is sad my dear bicklei to find a man of your intellect
so utterli wronghead and misguid i have convict you of error at
least half a dozen time and not to confess it is mere pigheaded
good night i am sure that sarah will be sit up for me
silli old idiot bicklei would sai shake hi fist after him the
onli wai to get him to see the truth would be to saw hi head open and
pour it in
then we would both laugh
such were my two most intim friend although i admit it wa rather
like the equat cultiv close relationship with the north and
south pole certainli bastin wa as far from bicklei as those point
of the earth ar apart while i as it were sat equal distant between
the two howev we were all veri happi togeth sinc in certain
charact there ar few thing that bind men more close than
profound differ of opinion
now i must turn to my more person affair after all it is imposs
for a man to satisfi hi soul if he ha anyth of the sort about him
which in the remotest degre answer to that descript with the husk
of wealth luxuri and indol supplement by occasion theolog
and other argument between hi friend becom profoundli convinc
of thi truth i search round for someth to do and like noah
dove on the wast of water found noth then i ask bicklei and
bastin for their opinion as to my best futur cours bicklei prove a
barren draw he rub hi nose and feebli suggest that i might go
in for research work which of cours onli repres hi own
ambit i ask him indignantli how i could do such a thing without
ani scientif qualif whatev he admit the difficulti but
repli that i might endow other who had the qualif
in short becom a mulch cow for suck scientist i repli and
broke off the convers
bastin idea wa first that i should teach in a sundai school
secondli that if thi career did not satisfi all my aspir i
might be ordain and becom a missionari
on my reject of thi brilliant advic he remark that the onli
other thing he could think of wa that i should get marri and have a
larg famili which might possibl advantag the nation and ultim
enrich the kingdom of heaven though of such thing no on could
be quit sure at ani rate he wa certain that at present i wa in
practic neglect my duti whatev it might be and in fact on of
those cumber of the earth who he observ in the newspap he took
in and read when he had time were veri happili namedth idl rich
which remind me he ad that the clothingclub financ ar in
a perfectli scandal condit in fact it is 25 in debt an amount
that as the squir of the parish i consid it incumb on you to make
good not as a chariti but as an oblig
look here my friend i said ignor all the rest will you answer
me a plain question have you found marriag such a success that you
consid it your duti to recommend it to other and if you have why
have you not got the larg famili of which you speak
of cours not he repli with hi usual frank inde it is in
mani wai so disagre that i am convinc it must be right and for
the good of all concern as regard the famili i am sure i do not
know but sarah never like babi which perhap ha someth to do
with it
then he sigh ad you see arbuthnot we have to take thing as
we find them in thi world and hope for a better
which is just what i am try to do you unillumin old donkei i
exclaim and left him there shake hi head over matter in gener
but i think princip over sarah
by the wai i think that the villag recognis thi good ladi
vinegari natur at least thei us to call her sour sal
chapter iii natali
now what bastin had said about marriag stuck in my mind as hi
blunder remark had a wai of do perhap becaus of the grain
of honest truth with which thei were often permeat probabl in my
posit it wa more or less my duti to marri but here came the rub
i had never experienc ani lean that wai i wa as much a man as
other more so than mani ar perhap and i like women but at the
same time thei repel me
my old fastidi came in to my tast there wa alwai someth
wrong about them while thei attract on part of my natur thei
revolt anoth part and on the whole i prefer to do without their
intim societi rather than work violenc to thi second and higher
part of me moreov quit at the begin of my career i had
conclud from observ that a man get on better in life alon
rather than with anoth to drag at hi side or by whom perhap he must
be drag still true marriag such as most men and some women have
dream of in their youth had alwai been on of my ideal inde it
wa on and around thi vision that i wrote that first book of mine which
wa so success sinc i knew thi to be unattain in our imperfect
condit howev notwithstand bastin strictur again i
dismiss the whole matter from my mind as a vain imagin
as an altern i reflect upon a parliamentari career which i wa
not too old to begin and even toi with on or two opportun that
offer themselv as these do to men of wealth and advanc view
thei never came to anyth for in the end i decid that parti
polit were so hate and so dishonest that i could not bring myself
to put my neck beneath their yoke i wa sure that if i tri to do
so i should fail more complet than i had done at the bar and in
literatur here too i am quit certain that i wa right
the upshot of it all wa that i sought refug in that last expedi of
weari englishmen travel not as a globetrott but leisur and with
an inquir mind learn much but again find like the ancient
writer whom i have quot alreadi that there is no new thing under the
sun that with certain variat it is the same thing over and over
again
no i will make an except the east did interest me enorm there
it wa at benar that i came into touch with certain thinker who
open my ey to a great deal thei releas some hidden spring in
my natur which hitherto had alwai been strive to break through the
crust of our convent and inherit idea i know now that what i
wa seek wa noth less than the infinit that i had immort
long in me i listen to all their solemn talk of epoch and year
measureless to man and reflect with a thrill that after all man might
have hi part in everi on of them ye that bird of passag as he
seem to be fly out of dark into dark still he might have
spread hi wing in the light of other sun million upon million of
year ago and might still spread them grown radiant and gloriou
million upon million of year henc in a time unborn
if onli i could know the truth wa life accord to bicklei mere
a short activ bound by nothing befor and behind or accord
to bastin a convent goldenharp and halo immort a word
of which he did not in the least understand the mean
or wa it someth quit differ from either of these someth vast
and splendid beyond the reach of vision someth godsent begin
and end in the etern absolut and at last partak of hi
attribut and natur and from aeon to aeon shot through with hi light
and how wa the truth to be learn i ask my eastern friend and
thei talk vagu of long ascet prepar of year upon year of
learn from whom i could not quit discov i wa sure it could not
be from them becaus clearli thei did not know thei onli pass on
what thei had heard elsewher when or how thei either could not or
would not explain so at length i gave it up have satisfi myself
that all thi wa but an effort of orient imagin call into life
by the sweet influenc of the eastern star
i gave it up and went awai think that i should forget but i did
not forget i wa quick with a new hope or at ani rate with a new
aspir and that secret child of holi desir grew and grew within
my soul till at length it flash upon me that thi soul of mine wa
itself the hidden master from which i must learn my lesson no wonder
that those eastern friend could not give hi name see that whatev
thei realli knew as distinguish from what thei had heard and it wa
littl enough each of them had learn from the teach of hi own
soul
thu then i too becam a dreamer with onli on long the long
for wisdom for that spirit touch which should open my ey and enabl
me to see
yet now it happen strang enough that when i seem within myself
to have littl further interest in the thing of the world and least
of all in women i who had taken anoth guest to dwell with me
those thing of the world came back to me and in the shape of woman the
inevit probabl it wa so decre sinc is it not written that no
man can live to himself alon or lose himself in watch and nurtur
the growth of hi own soul
it happen thu i went to rome on my wai home from india and stai
there a while on the dai after my arriv i wrote my name in the book
of our minist to itali at that time sir alfr upton not becaus i
wish him to ask me to dinner but for the reason that i had heard of
him as a man of archeolog tast and thought that he might enabl me
to see thing which otherwis i should not see
as it chanc he knew about me through some of my devonshir neighbour
who were friend of hi and did ask me to dinner on the follow
night i accept and found myself on of a consider parti some of
them distinguish english peopl who wore order as is customari when
on dine with the repres of our sovereign see these and
thi show that in the best of us vaniti is onli latent for the first
time in my life i wa sorri that i had none and wa onli plain mr
arbuthnot who as sir alfr explain to me polit must go in to
dinner last becaus all the rest had titl and without even a ladi as
there wa not on to spare
nor wa my lot better when i got there as i found myself seat
between an italian countess and a russian princ neither of whom could
talk english while ala i knew no foreign languag not even french
in which thei address me seem surpris that i did not understand
them i wa humili at my own ignor although in fact i wa not
ignor onli my educ had been classic inde i wa a good
classic and had kept up my knowledg more or less especi sinc i
becam an idl man in my confus it occur to me that the italian
countess might know latin from which her own languag wa deriv and
address her in that tongu she stare and sir alfr who wa not
far off and overheard me he also knew latin burst into laughter and
proceed to explain the joke in a loud voic first in french and
then in english to the assembl compani who all becam infect with
merriment and also stare at me as a curios
then it wa that for the first time i saw natali for ow to
a mistak of my driver i had arriv rather late and had not been
introduc to her as her father onli daughter her mother be dead
she wa seat at the end of the tabl behind a fanlik arrang of
white madonna lili and she had bent forward and like the other wa
look at me but in such a fashion that her head from that distanc
seem as though it were surround and crown with lili inde the
greatest art could not have produc a more beauti effect which wa
howev realli on of nake accid
an angel look down upon earth through the lili of heaventhat wa
the rather absurd thought which flash into my mind i did not quit
realis her face at first except that it seem to be both dark and
fair as a fact her wave hair which grew rather low upon her forehead
wa dark and her larg soft ey were grei i did not know and to
thi moment i do not know if she wa realli beauti but certainli the
light that shone through those ey of her and seem to be reflect
upon her delic featur wa beauti itself it wa like that glow
through a thin vase of the purest alabast within which a lamp is
place and i felt thi effect to aris from no chanc like that of the
lilyset but as it were from the lamp of the spirit within
our ey met and i suppos that she saw the wonder and admir
in mine at ani rate her amus smile fade leav the face rather
seriou though still sweetli seriou and a ting of colour crept over
it as the first hue of dawn creep into a pearli sky then she withdrew
herself behind the screen of lili and for the rest of that dinner
which i thought wa never come to an end practic i saw her no
more onli i note as she pass out that although not tall she
wa round and grace in shape and that her hand were peculiarli
delic
afterward in the drawingroom her father with whom i had talk at the
tabl introduc me to her sai
my daughter is the real archaeologist mr arbuthnot and i think if
you ask her she mai be abl to help you
then he bustl awai to speak to some of hi import guest from whom
i think he wa seek polit inform
my father exagger she said in a soft and veri sympathet voic
but perhapsand she motion me to a seat at her side
then we talk of the place and thing that i more particularli desir
to see and well the end of it wa that i went back to my hotel in love
with natali and as she afterward confess she went to bed in love
with me
it wa a curiou busi more like meet a veri old friend from whom
on had been separ by circumst for a score of year or so than
anyth els we were so to speak intim from the first we
knew all about each other although here and there wa someth new
someth differ which we could not rememb line of thought
vein of memori which we did not possess in common on on point i am
absolut clear it wa not sole the everydai and ancient appeal of
woman to man and man to woman which drew us togeth though doubtless
thi had it part in our attach as under our human condit it
must do see that it is natur bait to ensur the continu of
the race it wa someth more someth quit beyond that elementari
impuls
at ani rate we love and on even in the shelter of the solemn
wall of the great coliseum at rome which at that hour were shut to
all except ourselv we confess our love i realli think we must have
chosen the spot by tacit but mutual consent becaus we felt it to be
fit it wa so old so impregn with everi human experi
from the direst crime of the tyrant who thought himself a god to the
sublimest sacrific of the martyr who alreadi wa half a god with everi
vice and virtu also which li between these extrem that it seem
to be the most fit altar whereon to offer our heart and all that
caus them to beat each to the other
so natali and i were betroth within a month of our first meet
within three we were marri for what wa there to prevent or delai
natur sir alfr wa delight see that he possess but
small privat resourc and i wa abl to make ampl provis for
hi daughter who had hitherto shown herself somewhat difficult in thi
busi of matrimoni and now wa border on her twentyseventh year
everybodi wa delight everyth went smoothli as a sledg slide
down a slope of frozen snow and the mist of time hid whatev might be
at the end of that slope probabl a plain at the worst the upward rise
of ordinari life
that is what we thought if we thought at all certainli we never
dream of a precipic why should we who were young by comparison
quit healthi and veri rich who think of precipic under such
circumst when disast seem to be elimin and death is yet a
long wai off
and yet we ought to have done so becaus we should have known that
smooth surfac without impedi to the runner often end in someth
of the kind
i am bound to sai that when we return home to fulcomb where of
cours we met with a great recept includ the ring out of
tune of the new peal of bell that i had given to the church bastin
made hast to point thi out
your wife seem a veri nice and beauti ladi arbuthnot he
reflect aloud after dinner when mr bastin glower as usual
though what at i do not know had been escort from the room by
natali and realli when i come to think of it you ar an unusu
fortun person you possess a great deal of monei much more than you
have ani right to which you seem to have done veri littl to earn and
do not spend quit as i should like you to do and thi nice properti
that ought to be own by a great number of peopl as accord to
the view you express i should have thought you would acknowledg and
everyth els that a man can want it is veri strang that you should
be so favour and not becaus of ani particular merit of your own
which on can see howev i have no doubt it will all come even in the
end and you will get your share of troubl like other perhap mr
arbuthnot will have no children as there is so much for them to take or
perhap you will lose all your monei and have to work for your live
which might be good for you or he ad still think aloud after
hi fashion perhap she will die youngsh ha that kind of face
although of cours i hope she wont he ad wake up
i do not know why but hi wander word struck me cold the
proverbi funer bell at the marriag feast wa noth to them i
suppos it wa becaus in a flash of intuit i knew that thei would
come true and that he wa an appoint cassandra perhap thi uncanni
knowledg overcam my natur indign at such supergaucheri of
which no on but bastin could have been capabl and even prevent me
from repli at all so that i mere sat still and look at him
but bicklei did repli with some vigour
forgiv me for sai so bastin he said bristl all over as it
were but your remark which mai or mai not be in accord with the
principl of your religion seem to me to be in singularli bad tast
thei would have turn the stomach of a gather of earli christian
who appear to have been the worst manner peopl in the world and at
ani decent heathen feast your neck would have been wrung as that of a
bird of ill omen
why ask bastin blankli i onli said what i thought to be the
truth the truth is better than what you call good tast
then i will sai what i think also to be the truth repli bicklei
grow furiou it is that you us your christian as a cloak for
bad manner it teach consider and sympathi for other of which
you seem to have none moreov sinc you talk of the death of peopl
wive i will tell you someth about your own as a doctor which i
can do as i never attend her it is highli probabl in my opinion
that she will die befor mr arbuthnot who is quit a healthi person
with a good prospect of life
perhap said bastin if so it will be god will and i shall not
complain here bicklei snort though i do not see what you can know
about it but why should you cast reflect on the earli christian
who were peopl of strong principl live in rough time and had to
wage war against an establish devilworship i know you ar angri
becaus thei smash up the statu of venu and so forth but had i
been in their place i should have done the same
of cours you would who doubt it but as for the earli christian and
their iconoclast performanceswel curs them that all and he
sprang up and left the room
i follow him
let it not be suppos from the abov scene that there wa ani
illfeel between bastin and bicklei on the contrari thei were much
attach to each other and thi kind of quarrel meant no more than
the strong express of their individu view to which thei were
accustom from their colleg dai for instanc bastin wa alwai
talk about the earli christian and missionari while bicklei
loath both the earli christian becaus of the destruct which
thei had wrought in egypt itali greec and elsewher of all that wa
beauti and the missionari becaus as he said thei were degrad
and spoil the nativ race and by induc them to wear cloth
render them liabl to diseas bastin would answer that their soul
were more import than their bodi to which bicklei repli that as
there wa no such thing as a soul except in the stupid imagin of
priest he differ entir on the point as it wa quit imposs
for either to convinc the other there the convers would end or
drift into someth in which thei were mutual interest such as
natur histori and the hygien of the neighbourhood
here i mai state that bicklei keen profession ey wa not mistaken
when he diagnos mr bastin state of health as danger as a
matter of fact she wa suffer from heart diseas that a doctor can
often recognis by the colour of the lip etc which brought about her
death under the follow circumst
her husband attend some ecclesiast function at a town over twenti
mile awai and wa to have return by a train which would have brought
him home about five oclock as he did not arriv she wait at
the station for him until the last train came in about seven
oclockwithout the belov basil then on a winter night she tore
up to the priori and beg me to lend her a dogcart in which to drive
to the said town to look for him i expostul against the folli of
such a proceed sai that no doubt basil wa safe enough but had
forgotten to telegraph or thought that he would save the sixpenc which
the wire cost
then it came out to natali and my intens amus that all thi
wa the result of her jealou natur of which i have spoken she said
she had never slept a night awai from her husband sinc thei were
marri and with so mani design person about she could not sai
what might happen if she did so especi as he wa such a favourit
and so handsom bastin wa a fine look man in hi rug wai
i suggest that she might have a littl confid in him to which she
repli darkli that she had no confid in anybodi
the end of it wa that i lent her the cart with a fast hors and a good
driver and off she went reach the town in question some two and a
half hour later she search high and low through wind and sleet but
found no basil he it appear had gone on to exet to look at the
cathedr where some build wa be done and miss the last train
had there slept the night
about on in the morn after be nearli lock up as a mad woman
she drove back to the vicarag again to find no basil even then she
did not go to bed but rage about the hous in her wet cloth until
she fell down utterli exhaust when her husband did return on the
follow morn full of inform about the cathedr she wa
danger ill and actual pass awai while utter a violent
tirad against him for hi suppos suspici proceed
that wa the end of thi truli odiou british matron
in after dai bastin by some peculiar mental process canonis her in
hi imagin as a kind of saint so love he would sai such a
devot wife why my dear humphrei i can assur you that even in the
midst of her deathstruggl her last thought were of me word that
caus bicklei to snort with more than usual vigour until i kick him
to silenc beneath the tabl
chapter iv death and departur
now i must tell of my own terribl sorrow which turn my life to
bitter and my hope to ash
never were a man and a woman happier togeth than i and natali
mental physic spiritu we were perfectli mate and we love
each other dearli truli we were as on yet there wa someth about
her which fill me with vagu fear especi after she found that
she wa to becom a mother i would talk to her of the child but she
would sigh and shake her head her ey fill with tear and sai that
we must not count on the continu of such happi as our for it
wa too great
i tri to laugh awai her doubt though whenev i did so i seem to
hear bastin slow voic remark casual that she might die as he
might have comment on the qualiti of the claret at last howev i
grew terrifi and ask her bluntli what she meant
i dont quit know dearest she repli especi as i am
wonderfulli well butbut
but what i ask
but i think that our companionship is go to be broken for a littl
while
for a littl while i exclaim
ye humphrei i think that i shall be taken awai from youyou know
what i mean and she nod toward the churchyard
oh my god i groan
i want to sai thi she ad quickli that if such a thing should
happen as it happen everi dai i implor you dearest humphrei not to
be too much distress sinc i am sure that you will find me again
no i cant explain how or when or where becaus i do not know i have
prai for light but it ha not come to me all i know is that i am not
talk of reunion in mr bastin kind of convent heaven which he
speak about as though to reach it on stumbl through dark for
a minut into a fine new hous next door where excel servant had
made everyth readi for your arriv and all the light were turn
up it is someth quit differ from that and veri much more real
then she bent down ostens to pat the head of a littl black cocker
spaniel call tommi which had been given to her as a puppi a highli
intellig and affection anim that we both ador and that love
her as onli a dog can love realli i knew it wa to hide her tear
and fled from the room lest she should see mine
as i went i heard the dog whimper in a peculiar wai as though some
sympathet knowledg had been commun to it wonder anim
intellig
that night i spoke to bicklei about the matter repeat exactli what
had pass as i expect he smile in hi grave rather sarcast wai
and made light of it
my dear humphrei he said dont torment yourself about such fanci
thei ar of everydai occurr among women in your wife condit
sometim thei take on form sometim anoth when she ha got her
babi you will hear no more of them
i tri to be comfort but in vain
the dai and week went by like a long nightmar and in due cours the
event happen bicklei wa not attend the case it wa not in
hi line he said and he prefer that where a friend wife wa
concern somebodi els should be call in so it wa put in charg of
a veri good local man with a larg experi in such domest matter
how am i to tell of it everyth went wrong as for the detail let
them be ultim bicklei did oper and if surpass skill could
have save her it would have been done but the other man had misjudg
the condit it wa too late noth could help either mother or
child a littl girl who di shortli after she wa born but not befor
she had been christen also by the name of natali
i wa call in to sai farewel to my wife and found her radiant
triumphant even in her weak
i know now she whisper in a faint voic i understood as the
chloroform pass awai but i cannot tell you everyth is quit well
my darl go where you seem call to go far awai oh the wonder
place in which you will find me not know that you have found me
goodby for a littl while onli for a littl while my own my own
then she di and for a time i too seem to die but could not i
buri her and the child here at fulcomb or rather i buri their
ash sinc i could not endur that her belov bodi should see
corrupt
afterward when all wa over i spoke of these last word of natali
with both bicklei and bastin for somehow i seem to wish to learn
their separ view
the latter i mai explain had been present at the end in hi spiritu
capac but i do not think that he in the least understood the natur
of the drama which wa pass befor hi ey hi prayer and the
christen absorb all hi attent and he never wa a man who could
think of more than on thing at a time
when i told him exactli what had happen and repeat the word that
natali spoke he wa much interest in hi own nebul wai and said
that it wa delight to meet with an exampl of a good christian such
as my wife had been who actual saw someth of heaven befor she had
gone there hi own faith wa he thank god fairli robust but still
an undoubt occurr of the sort act as a refresh like rain
on a pastur when it is rather dry you know he ad break into
simil
i remark that she had not seem to speak in the sens he indic
but appear to allud to someth quit near at hand and more or less
immedi
i dont know that there is anyth nearer at hand than the hereaft
he answer i expect she meant that you will probabl soon die and
join her in paradis if you ar worthi to do so but of cours it is
not wise to put too much relianc upon word spoken by peopl at the
last becaus often thei dont quit know what thei ar sai inde
sometim i think thi wa so in the case of my own wife who realli
seem to me to talk a good deal of rubbish goodby i promis to see
widow jenkin thi afternoon about have her varicos vein cut out
and i mustnt stop here wast time in pleasant convers she
think just as much of her varicos vein as we do of the loss of our
wive
i wonder what bastin idea of unpleas convers mai be thought
i to myself as i watch him depart alreadi woolgath on some
other subject probabl the heresi of on of those earli father who
occupi most of hi thought
bicklei listen to my tale in sympathet silenc as a doctor doe to
a patient when he wa oblig to speak he said that it wa interest
as an exampl of a tendenc of certain mind toward romant vision
which sometim assert itself even in the throe of death
you know he ad that i put faith in none of these thing i
wish that i could but reason and scienc both show me that thei lack
foundat the world on the whole is a sad place where we arriv
through the passion of other implant in them by natur which
although it care noth for individu death is tender toward the
impuls of race of everi sort to preserv their collect life
inde the impuls is natur or at least it chief manifest
consequ whether we be gnat or eleph or anyth between and
beyond even star for aught i know we must make the best of thing as
thei ar take the good and the evil as thei come and get all we
can out of life until it leav us after which we need not troubl
you had a good time for a littl while and were happi in it now you
ar have a bad time and ar wretch perhap in the futur when your
mental balanc ha reassert itself you will have other good time in
the afternoon of your dai and then follow twilight and the dark that
is all there is to hope for and we mai as well look the thing in the
face onli i confess my dear fellow that your experi convinc me
that marriag should be avoid at whatev inconveni inde i
have long wonder that anyon can take the respons of bring
a child into the world but probabl nobodi doe in cold blood except
misguid idiot like bastin he ad he would have twenti had not
hi luck interven
then you believ in noth friend i said

that depend on what you mean by miracl scienc show us all kind
of wonder which our great grandfath would have call miracl but
these ar noth but law that we ar begin to understand give me
an instanc
well i repli at hazard if you were assur by someon that a man
could live for a thousand year
i should tell him that he wa a fool or a liar that is all it is
imposs
or that the same ident spirit anim principlecal it what
you willcan flit from bodi to bodi sai in success ag or that
the dead can commun with the live
convinc me of ani of these thing arbuthnot and mind you i desir
to be convinc and i will take back everi word i have said and walk
through fulcomb in a white sheet proclaim myself the fool now i
must get off to the cottag hospit to cut out widow jenkinss varicos
vein thei ar tangibl and real at ani rate about the largest i ever
saw inde give up dream old boi and take to someth us you
might go back to your fiction write you seem to have lean that
wai and you know you need not publish the stori except privat for
the edif of your friend
with thi parthian shaft bicklei took hi departur to make a job of
widow jenkinss leg
i took hi advic dure the next few month i did write someth
which occupi my thought for a while more or less it li in my safe
to thi minut for somehow i have never been abl to make up my mind to
burn what cost me so much physic and mental toil
when it wa finish my melancholi return to me with ad forc
everyth in the hous took a tongu and cri to me of past dai
it wall echo a voic that i could never hear again in the veri
lookingglass i saw the reflect of a lost presenc although i had
move myself for the purpos of sleep to a littl room at the further
end of the build footstep seem to creep about my bed at night
and i heard the rustl of a rememb dress without the door the place
grew hate to me i felt that i must get awai from it or i should go
mad
on afternoon bastin arriv carri a book and in a state of high
indign thi work written as he said by some ribald travel
grossli traduc the charact of missionari to the south sea island
especi of those of the societi to which he subscrib and he threw
it on the tabl in hi righteou wrath bicklei pick it up and open
it at a photograph of a veri pretti south sea island girl clad in a few
flower and noth els which he held toward bastin sai
is it to thi child of natur that you object i call her distinctli
attract though perhap she doe wear her hibiscu bloom with a
differ to our womena littl lower down
the devil is alwai attract repli bastin gloomili child of
natur inde i call her child of sin that photograph is enough to
make my poor sarah turn in her grave
why ask bicklei see that wide sea roll between you and thi
duski venu also i thought that accord to your hebrew legend sin
came in with bark garment
you should search the scriptur bicklei i broke in and cultiv
accuraci it wa figleav that symbolis it arriv the garment
which i think were of skin develop later
perhap went on bicklei who had turn the page she he refer
to the late mr bastin would have prefer her thu and he held up
anoth illustr of the same woman
in thi the nativ bell appear after convers clad in brokendown
staysi suppos thei were staysout of which she seem to bulg and
flow in everi direct a dirti white dress sever size too small
a kind of salvat armi bonnet without a crown and a prayerbook which
she held press to her middl the gener effect be hideou and in
some curiou wai improp
certainli said bastin though i admit her cloth do not seem to
fit and she ha not button them up as she ought but it is not of the
pictur so much as of the letterpress with it fals and scandal
accus that i complain
why do you complain ask bicklei probabl it is quit true though
that we could never ascertain without visit the ladi home
if i could afford it exclaim bastin with rise anger i should
like to go there and expos thi vile traduc of my cloth
so should i answer bicklei and expos these introduc of
consumpt measl and other european diseas to sai noth of gin
among an innoc and arcadian peopl
how can you call them innoc bicklei when thei murder and eat
missionari
i dare sai we should all eat a missionari bastin if we were hungri
enough wa the answer after which someth occur to chang the
convers
but i kept the book and read it as a neutral observ and came to the
conclus that these south sea island a land where it wa alwai
afternoon must be a charm place in which perhap the star of
the tropic and the scent of the flower might enabl on to forget a
littl or at least take the edg off memori why should i not visit
them and escap anoth long and dreari english winter no i could not
do so alon if bastin and bicklei were there their etern argument
might amus me well why should thei not come also when on ha monei
thing can alwai be arrang
the idea which had it root in thi absurd convers took a curiou
hold on me i thought of it all the even be alon and that night
it rearos in my dream i dream that my lost natali appear to me
and show me a pictur it wa of a long low land a curv shore
of which the end were out of the pictur whereon grew tall palm and
where great comber broke upon gleam sand
then the pictur seem to becom a realiti and i saw natali herself
strang chang in her aspect strang vari in face and figur
strang bright stand in the mouth of a pass whereof the littl
border cliff were cover with bush and low tree whose green
wa almost hid in love flower there in my dream she stood smile
mysteri and stretch out her arm toward me
as i awok i seem to hear her voic repeat her dy word go
where you seem call to go far awai oh the wonder place in which
you will find me not know that you have found me
with some variat thi dream visit me twice that night in the
morn i woke up quit determin that i would go to the south sea
island even if i must do so alon on that same even bastin and
bicklei dine with me i said noth to them about my dream for bastin
never dream and bicklei would have set it down to indigest but
when the cloth had been clear awai and we were drink our glass
of portboth bastin and bicklei onli took on the former becaus he
consid port a sin indulg of the flesh the latter becaus he
fear it would give him gouti remark casual that thei both look
veri run down and as though thei want a rest thei agre at least
each of them said he had notic it in the other inde bastin ad
that the damp and the cold in the church in which he held daili
servic to no congreg except the old woman who clean it had
given him rheumat which prevent him from sleep
do call thing by their proper name interrupt bicklei i told
you yesterdai that what you ar suffer from is neuriti in your right
arm which will becom chronic if you neglect it much longer i have the
same thing myself so i ought to know and unless i can stop oper
for a while i believ my finger will becom useless also someth is
affect my sight overstrain i suppos so that i am oblig to wear
stronger and stronger glass i think i shall have to leav ogden hi
partner in charg for a while and get awai into the sun there is
none here befor june
i would if i could pai a locum tenen and were quit sure it isnt
wrong said bastin
i am glad you both think like that i remark as i have a
suggest to make to you i want to go to the south sea about which we
were talk yesterdai to get the thorough chang that bicklei ha been
advis for me and i should be veri grate if you would both come as
my guest you bicklei make so much monei out of cut peopl about
that you can arrang your own affair dure your absenc but as for
you bastin i will see to the wherewith for the locum tenen and
everyth els
you ar veri kind said bastin and certainli i should like to expos
that misguid author who probabl publish hi offens work without
think that what he wrote might affect the subscript to the
missionari societi also to show bicklei that he is not alwai right
as he seem to think but i could never dream of accept without the
full approv of the bishop
you might get that of your nurs also if she happen to be still
aliv mock bicklei as for hi lordship i dont think he will
rais ani object when he see the certif i will give you about
the state of your health he is a great believ in me ever sinc i
took that carbuncl out of hi neck which he got becaus he will not eat
enough as for me i mean to come if onli to show you how continu
and persist you ar wrong but arbuthnot how do you mean to go
i dont know in a mail steamer i suppos
if you can run to it a yacht would be much better
that a good idea for on could get out of the beaten track and
see the place that ar never or seldom visit i will make some
inquiri and now to celebr the occas let us all have anoth
glass of port and drink a toast
thei hesit and were lost bastin murmur someth about do
without hi stout next dai as a penanc then thei both ask what wa
the toast each of them after thought suggest that it should be the
utter confus of the other
i shook my head whereon as a result of further cogit bastin
submit that the unknown would be suitabl bicklei said that he
thought thi a foolish idea as everyth worth know wa alreadi
known and what wa the good of drink to the rest a toast to the
truth would be better
a notion came to me
let us combin them i said and drink to the unknown truth
so we did though bastin grumbl that the perform made him feel
like pilat
we ar all pilat in our wai i repli with a sigh
that is what i think everi time i diagnos a case exclaim bicklei
as for me i laugh and for some unknown reason felt happier than i
had done for month oh if onli the writer of that tourist tale of the
south sea island could have guess what fruit hi lightthrown seed
would yield to us and to the world
i made my inquiri through a london agenc which hire out yacht or
sold them to the idl rich as i expect there were plenti to be had
at a price but wealthi as i wa the figur ask of the buyer of ani
suitabl craft stagger me in the end howev i charter on
for six month certain and at so much per month for as long as i like
afterward the owner paid insur and everyth els on condit
that thei appoint the captain and first mate also the engin for
thi yacht which wa name star of the south could steam at about ten
knot as well as sail
i know noth about yacht and therefor shall not attempt to describ
her further than to sai that she wa of five hundr and fifti ton
burden veri well construct and smart to look at as well she might
be see that a deceas millionair from whose executor i hire her
had spent a fortun in build and equip her in the best possibl
style in all her crew consist of thirtytwo hand a peculiar of
the vessel wa that ow to some fanci of the late owner the passeng
accommod which wa splendid lai forward of the bridg thi with
the ship storeroom refriger chamber etc be almost in the
bow it wa ow to these arrang which were unusu that the
executor found it imposs to sell and were therefor glad to accept
such an offer as mine in order to save expens perhap thei hope that
she might go to the bottom be heavili insur if so the fate did
not disappoint them
the captain name astlei wa a jovial person who held everi kind of
certif he seem so extraordinarili abl at hi busi that
person i suspect him of have made mistak in the cours of hi
career not unconnect with the worship of bacchu in thi i believ
i wa right otherwis a man of such attain would have been
command someth bigger than a privat yacht the first mate
jacobsen wa a melancholi dane a spiritualist who plai the
concertina and seem to be abl to do without sleep the crew were a
mix lot good men for the most part and quit unobjection more
than half of them be scandinavian i think that is all i need sai
about the star of the south
the arrang wa that the star of the south should proce through
the strait of gibraltar to marseil where we would join her and
thenc travel via the suez canal to australia and on to the south sea
return home as our fanci or conveni might dictat
all the first part of the plan we carri out to the letter of the
remaind i sai noth at present
the star of the south wa ampli provid with everi kind of store among
them were medicin and surgic instrument select by bicklei and
a case of bibl and other religi work in sundri languag of the
south sea select by bastin whose bishop when he understood the
piou object of hi journei had rather encourag than hinder
hi departur on sick leav and a larg number of novel book of
refer etc laid in by myself she duli sail from the thame and
reach marseil after a safe and easi passag where all three of us
board her
i forgot to add that she had anoth passeng the littl spaniel
tommi i had intend to leav him behind but while i wa pack up he
follow me about with such evid understand of my purpos that my
heart wa touch when i enter the motor to drive to the station he
escap from the hand of the servant whimper and took refug on my
knee after thi i felt that destini intend him to be our companion
moreov wa he not link with my dead past and had i but known it
with my live futur also
chapter v the cyclon
we enjoi our voyag exceedingli in egypt a land i wa glad to
revisit we onli stop a week while the star of the south which we
rejoin at suez coal and went through the canal thi howev gave
us time to spend a few dai in cairo visit the pyramid and sakkara
which bastin and bicklei had never seen befor and inspect the great
museum the journei up the nile wa postpon until our return it wa
a pleasant break and gave bicklei a most omnivor reader who wa well
acquaint with egyptian histori and theologi the opportun of try
to prove to bastin that christian wa a mere develop of the
ancient egyptian faith the argument that ensu mai be imagin
it never seem to occur to either of them that all faith mai be and
inde probabl ar progress in short differ rai of light
thrown from the variou facet of the same crystal as in turn these ar
shone upon by the sun of truth
our passag down the red sea wa cool and agreeabl thenc we shape
our cours for ceylon here again we stop a littl while to run up
to kandi and to visit the ruin citi of anarajapura with it great
buddhist tope that onc again gave rise to religi argument between
my two friend leav ceylon we struck across the indian ocean for
perth in western australia
it wa a long voyag sinc to save our coal we made most of it
under canva howev we were not dull as captain astlei wa a good
companion and even out of the melancholi dane jacobsen we had
entertain he insist on hold seanc in the cabin at which the
usual phenomena occur the tabl twist about voic were heard and
jacobsen accordion wail out tune abov our head these happen
drove bicklei to a kind of mad for here were event which he could
not explain he wa convinc that someon wa plai trick upon him
and devis the most elabor snare to detect the rogu entir
without result
first he accus jacobsen who wa veri indign and then me who
laugh in the end jacobsen and i left the circl and the cabin
which wa lock behind us onli bastin and bicklei remain there in
the dark present we heard sound of alterc and bicklei emerg
look veri red in the face follow by bastin who wa sai
can i help it if someth pull your nose and snatch off your
eyeglass which anyhow ar quit useless to you when there is no
light again is it possibl for me sit on the other side of that
tabl to have place the concertina on your head and made it plai the
nation anthem a thing that i have not the slightest idea how to do
pleas do not try to explain snap bicklei i am perfectli awar
that you deceiv me somehow which no doubt you think a good joke
my dear fellow i interrupt is it possibl to imagin old basil
deceiv anyon
why not snort bicklei see that he deceiv himself from on
year end to the other
i think said bastin that thi is an unholi busi and that we ar
both deceiv by the devil i will have no more to do with it and he
depart to hi cabin probabl to sai some appropri prayer
after thi the seanc were given up but jacobsen produc an instrument
call a planchett and with difficulti persuad bicklei to try it
which he did after mani precaut the thing a heartshap piec
of wood mount on wheel and with a pencil stuck at it narrow end
canter about the sheet of paper on which it wa place bicklei whose
hand rest upon it stare at the roof of the cabin then it began to
scribbl and after a while stop still
will the doctor look said jacobsen perhap the spirit have told
him someth
oh curs all thi silli talk about spirit exclaim bicklei as he
arrang hi eyeglass and held up the paper to the light for it wa
after dinner
he stare then with an exclam which i will not repeat and a
glanc of savag suspicion at the poor dane and the rest of us threw
it down and left the cabin i pick it up and next moment wa scream
with laughter there on the top of the sheet wa a rough but entir
recogniz portrait of bicklei with the accordion on hi head and
underneath written in a delic italian femal hand absolut
differ from hi own were these word taken from on of st paul
epistlesopposit of scienc fals so call underneath them
again in a scrawl schoolboi fist veri like bastin wa inscrib
tell us how thi is done you silli doctor who think yourself so
clever
it seem that the devil realli can quot scriptur wa bastin onli
comment while jacobsen stare befor him and smile
bicklei never allud to the matter but for dai afterward i saw him
experi with paper and chemic evid try to discov
a form of invis ink which would appear upon the applic of the
hand as he never said anyth about it i fear that he fail
thi planchett busi had a somewhat curiou end a few night
later jacobsen wa work it and ask me to put a question to oblig
him i inquir on what dai we should reach fremantl the port of perth
it wrote an answer which i mai remark subsequ prove to be quit
correct
that is not a good question said jacobsen sinc as a sailor i might
guess the repli try again mr arbuthnot
will anyth remark happen on our voyag to the south sea i
inquir casual
the planchett hesit a while then wrote rapidli and stop
jacobsen took up the paper and began to read the answer aloudto a
b the d and b the c the most remark thing will happen that have
happen to men live in the world
that must mean me bicklei the doctor and bastin the clergyman i
said laugh
jacobsen paid no attent for he wa read what follow as he did
so i saw hi face turn white and hi ey begin to start from hi head
then suddenli he tore the paper in piec which he thrust into hi
pocket lift hi great fist he utter some danish oath and with a
singl blow smash the planchett to fragment after which he strode
awai leav me astonish and somewhat disturb when i met him the
next morn i ask him what wa on the paper
oh he said quietli someth i should not like you tooprop
english gentlemen to see someth not nice you understand those
spirit not alwai good thei do that kind of thing sometim that
why i broke up thi planchett
then he began to talk of someth els and there the matter end
i should have said that princip with a view to put themselv
in a posit to confut each other ever sinc we had start from
marseil both bastin and bicklei spent a number of hour each dai in
assidu studi of the languag of the south sea island it becam a
kind of competit between them as to which could learn the most
now bastin although simpl and even stupid in some wai wa a good
scholar and as i knew at colleg had quit a faculti for acquir
languag in which he had taken high mark at examin bicklei
too wa an extraordinarili abl person with an excel memori
especi when he wa on hi mettl the result wa that befor we
ever reach a south sea island thei had a good work knowledg of the
local tongu
as it chanc too at perth we pick up a samoan and hi wife who
under some of the white australia regul were not allow to
remain in the countri and offer to work as servant in return for a
passag to apia where we propos to call some time or other with these
peopl bastin and bicklei talk all dai long till realli thei becam
fairli profici in their soft and beauti dialect thei wish me to
learn also but i said that with two such excel interpret and the
nativ while thei remain with us it seem quit unnecessari still
i pick up a good deal in a quiet wai as much as thei did perhap
at length travel on and on as a voyag to the planet mar might
do we sight the low shore of australia and that same even were
tow for our coal wa quit exhaust to the wharf at fremantl
here we spent a few dai explor the beauti town of perth and it
neighbourhood where it wa veri hot just then and eat peach
and grape till we made ourselv ill as a visitor often doe who is
unawar that fruit should not be taken in quantiti in australia while
the sun is high then we depart for melbourn almost befor our
arriv wa gener known sinc i did not wish to advertis our
presenc or the object of our journei
we cross the great australian bight of evil reput in the most
perfect weather inde it might have been a mill pond and after a
short stai at melbourn went on to sydnei where we coal again and
laid in suppli
then our real journei began the plan we laid out wa to sail to suva
in fiji about 1700 mile awai and after a stai there on to hawaii
or the sandwich island stop perhap at the phoenix island and the
central polynesian sporad such as christma and fan isl then
we propos to turn south again through the marshal archipelago and
the carolin island and so on to new guinea and the coral sea
particularli did we wish to visit easter island on account of
it marvel sculptur that ar suppos to be the relic of a
prehistor race in truth howev we had no fix plan except to go
wherev circumst and chanc might take us chanc i mai add or
someth els took full advantag of it opportun
we came to suva in safeti and spent a while in explor the beauti
fiji isl where both bastin and bicklei made full inquiri about
the work of the missionari each of them draw exactli opposit
conclus from the same set of admit fact thenc we steam to
samoa and put our two nativ ashor at apia where we procur some
coal we did not stai long enough in these island to investig them
howev becaus person of experi there assur us from certain
familiar sign that on of the terribl hurrican with which thei ar
afflict wa due to arriv shortli and that we should do well to put
ourselv beyond it reach so have coal and water we depart in
a hurri
up to thi time i should state we had met with the most wonder good
fortun in the matter of weather so good inde that never on on
occas sinc we left marseil had we been oblig to put the
fiddl on the tabl with the superstit of a sailor captain astlei
when i allud to the matter shook hi head sai that doubtless we
should pai for it later on sinc luck never goe all the wai and
cyclon were report to be about
here i must tell that after we were clear of apia it wa discov
that the danish mate who wa believ to be in hi cabin unwel from
someth he had eaten wa miss the question aros whether we
should put back to find him as we suppos that he had made a trip
inland and met with an accid or been otherwis delai i wa
in favour of do so though the captain think of the threaten
hurrican shook hi head and said that jacobsen wa a queer fellow who
might just as well have gone overboard as anywher els if he thought
he heard the spirit of whom he wa so fond call him while the
matter wa still in suspens i happen to go into my own stateroom
and there stuck in the lookingglass saw an envelop in the dane
handwrit address to myself on open it i found anoth seal
letter unaddress also a note that ran as follow
honour sir
you will think veri badli of me for leav you but the enclos which
i implor you not to open until you have seen the last of the star of
the south will explain my reason and i hope clear my reput
i thank you again and again for all your kind and prai that the
spirit who rule the world mai bless and preserv you also the doctor
and mr bastin
thi letter which left the fate of jacobsen quit unsolv for it
might mean either that he had desert or drown himself i put awai
with the enclosur in my pocket of cours there wa no oblig on me
to refrain from open the letter but i shrank from do so both from
some kind of sens of honour and to tell the truth for fear of what
it might contain i felt that thi would be disagre also although
there wa noth to connect them togeth i bethought me of the scene
when jacobsen had smash the planchett
on my return to the deck i said noth whatsoev about the discoveri
of the letter but onli remark that on reflect i had chang my
mind and agre with the captain that it would be unwis to attempt
to return in order to look for jacobsen so the boatswain a capabl
individu who had seen better dai wa promot to take hi watch
and we went on as befor how curious thing come about in the world
for nautic reason that were explain to me but which i will not
troubl to set down if inde i could rememb them i believ that
if we had return to apia we should have miss the great gale and
subsequ cyclon and with these much els but it wa not so fate
it wa on the fourth dai when we were roughli seven hundr mile or
more north of samoa that we met the edg of thi gale about sundown
the captain put on steam in the hope of push through it but that
night we dine for the first time with the fiddl on and by eleven
oclock it wa as much as on could do to stand in the cabin while the
water wa wash freeli over the deck fortun howev the
wind veer more aft of us so that by put about her head a littl
seamen must forgiv me if i talk of these matter as a landlubb we
ran almost befor the wind though not quit in the direct that we
wish to go
when the light came it wa blow veri hard inde and the sky wa
utterli overcast so that we got no glimps of the sun or of the
star on the follow night unfortun there wa no moon visibl
inde if there had been i do not suppos that it would have help us
becaus of the thick pall of cloud for quit seventytwo hour we
ran on beneath bare pole befor that gale the littl vessel behav
splendidli ride the sea like a duck but i could see that captain
astlei wa grow alarm when i said someth complimentari to him
about the conduct of the star of the south he repli that she wa
forg ahead all right but the question waswher to he had been
unabl to take an observ of ani sort sinc we left samoa both
hi patent log had been carri awai so that now onli the compass
remain and he had not the slightest idea where we were in that great
ocean stud with atol and island
i ask him whether we could not steam back to our proper cours but
he answer that to do so he would have to travel dead in the ey of the
gale and he doubt whether the engin would stand it also there wa
the question of coal to be consid howev he had kept the fire
go and would do what he could if the weather moder
that night dure dinner which now consist of tin food and whiski
and water for the sea had got to the gallei fire suddenli the gale
drop whereat we rejoic exceedingli the captain came down into the
saloon veri white and shaken i thought and i ask him to have a nip
of whiski to warm him up and to celebr our good fortun in have
run out of the wind he took the bottl and to my alarm pour out
a full half tumbler of spirit which he swallow undilut in two or
three gulp
that better he said with a hoars laugh but man what is it you
ar sai about have run out of the wind look at the glass
we have said bastin and it is wonderfulli steadi about 29 degre
or a littl over which it ha been for the last three dai
again astlei laugh in a mirthless fashion as he answer
oh that thing that the passeng glass i told the steward to put
it out of gear so that you might not be frighten it is an old trick
look at thi and he produc on of the portabl varieti out of hi
pocket
we look and it stood somewher between 27 degre and 28 degre
that the lowest glass i ever saw in the polynesian or ani other sea
dure thirti year it right too for i have test it by three
other he said
what doe it mean i ask rather anxious
south sea cyclon of the worst breed he repli that curs dane
knew it wa come and that why he left the ship prai as you never
prai befor and again he stretch out hi hand toward the whiski
bottl but i step between him and it shake my head thereon he
laugh for the third time and left the cabin though i saw him onc
or twice afterward these were realli the last word of intellig
convers that i ever had with captain astlei
it seem that we ar in some danger said bastin in an unmov kind
of wai i think that wa a good idea of the captain to put up a
petit i mean but as bicklei will scarc care to join in it i will
go into the cabin and do so myself
bicklei snort then said
confound that captain why did he plai such a trick upon us about the
baromet humphrei i believ he had been drink
so do i i said look at the whiski bottl otherwis after
take those precaut to keep us in the dark he would not have let
on like that
well said bicklei he cant get to the liquor except through thi
saloon as it is lock up forward with the other store
that noth i repli as doubtless he ha a suppli of hi own
rum i expect we must take our chanc
bicklei nod and suggest that we should go on deck to see what wa
happen so we went not a breath of wind wa stir and even the
sea seem to be settl down a littl at least so we judg from
the motion for we could not see either it or the sky everyth wa as
black as pitch we heard the sailor howev engag in rig guid
rope fore and aft and batten down the hatch with extra tarpaulin
by the light of lantern also thei were put rope round the boat
and do someth to the spar and topmast
present bastin join us have i suppos finish hi devot
realli it is quit pleasant here he said on never know how
disagre so much wind is until it stop
i lit my pipe make no answer and the match burn quit steadili
there in the open air
what is that exclaim bicklei stare at someth which now i saw
for the first time it look like a line of white approach through
the gloom with it came a hiss sound and although there wa still no
wind the rig began to moan mysteri like a thing in pain a big
drop of water also fell from the side into my pipe and put it out then
on of the sailor cri in a hoars voic
get down below governor unless you want to go out to sea
why inquir bastin
why beco the urrican is come that all come as though the
devil had kick it out of ell
bastin seem inclin to remonstr at thi sort of languag but we
push him down the companion and follow propel the spaniel tommi
in front of us next moment i heard the sailor batten the hatch with
hurri blow and when thi wa done to their satisfact heard their
feet also as thei ran into shelter
anoth instant and we were all ly in a heap on the cabin floor with
poor tommi on top of us the cyclon had struck the ship abov the wash
of water and the scream of the gale we heard other mysteri sound
which doubtless were caus by the yard hit the sea for the yacht
wa ly on her side i thought that all wa over but present there
came a rend crash nois the mast or on of them had gone and
by degre we right
near thing said bicklei good heaven what that
i listen for the electr light had temporarili gone out ow i
suppos to the dynamo have stop for a moment a most unholi and
hollow sound wa rise from the cabin floor it might have been
caus by a bullock with it windpip cut try to get it breath and
groan then the light came on again and we saw bastin ly at full
length on the carpet
he broken hi neck or someth i said
bicklei crept to him and have look sang out
it all right he onli seasick i thought it would come to that if
he drank so much tea
seasick i said faintlyseasick
that all said bicklei the nerv of the stomach act on the
brain or viceversathat is if bastin ha a brain he ad sotto
voce
oh groan the prostrat clergyman i wish that i were dead
dont troubl about that answer bicklei i expect you soon will
be here drink some whiski you donkei
bastin sat up and obei out of the bottl for it wa imposs to
pour anyth into a glass with result too dread to narrat
i call that a dirti trick he said present in a feebl voic
glower at bicklei
i expect i shall have to plai you a dirtier befor long for you ar a
pretti bad case old fellow
as a matter of fact he had for onc bastin had begun realli we thought
that he wa go to die somehow we got him into hi cabin which
open off the saloon and as he could drink noth more bicklei
manag to inject morphia or some other compound into him which made
him insens for a long while
he must be in a poor wai he said for the needl went more than a
quarter of an inch into him and he never cri out or stir couldnt
help it in that roll
but now i could hear the engin work and i think that the bow
of the vessel wa got head on to the sea for instead of roll we
pitch or rather the ship stood first upon on end and then upon the
other thi continu for a while until the first burst of the cyclon
had gone by then suddenli the engin stop i suppos that thei had
broken down but i never learn and we seem to veer about nearli
sink in the process and to run befor the hurrican at terrif
speed
i wonder where we ar go to i said to bicklei to the land of
sleep humphrei i imagin he repli in a more gentl voic than i
had often heard him us ad goodby old boi we have been real
friend havent we notwithstand my peculiar i onli wish that
i could think that there wa anyth in bastin view but i cant i
cant it good night for us poor creatur
chapter vi land
at last the electr light realli went out i had look at my watch
just befor thi happen and wound it up which bicklei remark wa
superflu and a wast of energi it then mark 320 in the morn
we had wedg bastin who wa now snore comfort into hi berth
with pillow and manag to tie a cord over himno it wa a larg
bath towel fix on end of it to the littl rack over hi bed and
the other to it framework as for ourselv we lai down on the floor
between the tabl leg which of cours were screw and the sette
protect ourselv as best we were abl by help of the cushion etc
between two of which we thrust the terrifi tommi who had been slide
up and down the cabin floor thu we remain expect death everi
moment till the light of dai a veri dim light struggl through a
porthol of which the iron cover had somehow been wrench off or
perhap it wa never shut i do not rememb
about thi time there came a lull in the hellish howl hurrican the
fact be i suppos that we had reach the centr of the cyclon i
suggest that we should try to go on deck and see what wa happen
so we start onli to find the entranc to the companion so faithfulli
secur that we could not by ani mean get out we knock and shout
but no on answer my belief is that at thi time everyon on the
yacht except ourselv had been wash awai and drown
then we return to the saloon which except for a littl water
trickl about the floor wa marvel dry and be hungri
retriev some bit of food and biscuit from it corner and at at
thi moment the cyclon began to blow again wors than ever but it
seem to us from anoth direct and befor it sped our poor
derelict barqu it blew all dai till for my part i grew utterli weari
and even long for the inevit end if my view were not quit those
of bastin certainli thei were not those of bicklei i had believ from
my youth up that the individu of man the ego so to speak doe
not die when life goe out of hi poor bodi and thi faith did not
desert me then therefor i wish to have it over and learn what there
might be upon the other side
we could not speak much becaus of the howl of the wind but bicklei
did manag to shout to me someth to the effect that hi partner
would in hi opinion make an end of their great practic within
two year which he ad wa a piti i nod my head not care
twopenc what happen to bicklei partner or their busi or to my
own properti or to anyth els when death is at hand most of us do
not think much of such thing becaus then we realis how small thei
ar inde i wa wonder whether within a few minut or hour i
should or should not see natali again and if thi were the end to
which she had seem to beckon me in that dream
on we sped and on about four in the afternoon we heard sound from
bastin cabin which faintli remind me of some tune i crept to the
door and listen evid he had awaken and wa sing or try
to sing for music wa not on of hi strong point for those in peril
on the sea devoutli did i wish that it might be heard present it
ceas so i suppos he went to sleep again
the dark gather onc more then of a sudden someth fear
happen there were stupend nois of a kind i had never heard
there were convuls it seem to us that the ship wa flung right up
into the air a hundr feet or more
tidal wave i expect shout bicklei
almost as he spoke she came down with the most appal crash on to
someth hard and nearli jar the sens out of us next the saloon
wa whirl round and round and yet be carri forward and we felt
air blow upon us then our sens left us as i clasp tommi to my
side whimper and lick my face my last thought wa that all wa
over and that present i should learn everyth or noth
i woke up feel veri bruis and sore and perceiv that light wa
flow into the saloon the door wa still shut but it had been
wrench off it hing and that wa where the light came in also some
of the teak plank of the deck jag and splinter were stick
up through the carpet the tabl had broken from it fasten and lai
upon it side everyth els wa on confus i look at bicklei
appar he had not awaken he wa stretch out still wedg in
with hi cushion and bleed from a wound in hi head i crept to him
in terror and listen he wa not dead for hi breath wa regular
and natur the whiski bottl which had been cork wa upon the floor
unbroken and about a third full i took a good pull at the spirit to
me it tast like nectar from the god then i tri to forc some down
bicklei throat but could not so i pour a littl upon the cut on hi
head the smart of it woke him in a hurri
where ar we now he exclaim you dont mean to tell me that bastin
is right after all and that we live again somewher els oh i could
never bear that ignomini
i dont know about live somewher els i said although my
opinion on that matter differ from your but i do know that you and
i ar still on earth in what remain of the saloon of the star of the
south
thank god for that let go and look for old bastin said bicklei i
do prai that he is all right also
it is most illog of you bicklei and inde wrong groan a deep
voic from the other side of the cabin door to thank a god in whom
you do not believ and to talk of prai for on of the worst and most
ineffici of hi servant when you have no faith in prayer
got you there my friend i said
bicklei murmur someth about forc of habit and look smaller than
i had ever seen him do befor
somehow we forc that door open it wa not easi becaus it had jam
within the cabin hang on either side of the bath towel which had
stood the strain nobli someth like a damp garment over a linen line
wa bastin most of whose bunk seem to have disappear yesbastin
pale and dishevel and look shrunk with hi hair touzl and hi
beard appar grow all wai but still bastin aliv if veri weak
bicklei ran at him and made a cursori examin with hi finger
noth broken he said triumphantli he all right
if you had hung over a towel for mani hour in most violent weather you
would not sai that groan bastin my insid is a pulp but perhap
you would be kind enough to unti me
bosh said bicklei as he obei all you want is someth to eat
meanwhil drink thi and he hand him the remain of the whiski
bastin swallow it everi drop murmur someth about take a
littl wine for hi stomach sake on of the paulin injunct you
know after which he wa much more cheer then we hunt about and
found some more of the biscuit and other food with which we fill
ourselv after a fashion
i wonder what ha happen said bastin i suppos that thank to
the skill of the captain we have after all reach the haven where we
would be
here he stop rub hi ey and look toward the saloon door
which as i have said had been wrench off it hing but appear
to have open wider than when i observ it last also tommi who wa
recov hi spirit utter a seri of low growl
it is a most curiou thing he went on and i suppos i must be
suffer from hallucin but i could swear that just now i saw
look through that door the same improp young woman cloth in a
few flower and noth els whose photograph in that abomin and
libel book wa indirectli the caus of our tempestu voyag
inde repli bicklei well so long as she ha not got on the
brokendown stai and the salvat armi bonnet without a crown which
you mai rememb she wore after she had fallen into the hand of your
fratern i am sure i do not mind in fact i should be delight to
see anyth so pleasant
at thi moment a distinct sound of femal titter aros from beyond
the door tommi bark and bicklei step toward it but i call to
him
look out where there ar women there ar sure to be men let us be
readi against accid
so we arm ourselv with pistol that is bicklei and i did bastin
be fortifi sole with a bibl
then we advanc a remark and dilapid trio and drag the
door wide instantli there wa a scurri and we caught sight of women
form wear onli flower and but few of these run over white
sand toward group of men arm with oddlook club some of which
were fashion to the shape of sword and spear to make an impress
i fire two shot with my revolv into the air whereupon both men and
women fled into grove of tree and vanish
thei dont seem to be accustom to white peopl said bicklei is it
possibl that we have found a shore upon which no missionari ha set a
foot
i hope so said bastin see that unworthi as i am then the
opportun for me would be veri great
we stood still and look about us thi wa what we saw all the after
part of the ship from forward of the bridg had vanish utterli there
wa not a trace of it she had as it were been cut in two more we were
some consider distanc from the sea which wa still rage over a
quarter of a mile awai where great white comber struck upon a reef
and spout into the air behind us wa a cliff appar of rock but
cover with earth and veget and against thi cliff in which the
prow of the ship wa buri she or what remain of her had come to
anchor for the last time
you see what ha happen i said a great tidal wave ha carri us
up here and retreat
that it exclaim bicklei look at the debri and he point to
tornup palm bush and seawe pile into heap which still ran salt
water also to a number of dead fish that lai about among them ad
well we ar save anyhow
and yet there ar peopl like you who sai that there is no provid
ejacul bastin
i wonder what the view of captain astlei and the crew ar or rather
were upon that matter interrupt bicklei
i dont know answer bastin look about him vagu it is true
that i cant see ani of them but if thei ar drown no doubt it is
becaus their period of us in thi world had end
let get down and look about us i remark be anxiou to avoid
further argument
so we scrambl from the remnant of the ship like noah descend out
of the ark as bastin said on to the beach beneath where tommi rush
to and fro gambol for joi here we discov a path which ran
diagon up the side of a cliff which wa nowher more than fifti or
sixti feet in height and possibl had onc form the shore of thi
land or perhap that of a lake up thi path we went follow the
track of mani human feet and reach the crest of the cliff look
about us bask as we did so in the beauti morn sun for the sky
wa now clear of cloud and with that last aw effort which destroi
our ship the cyclon had pass awai
we were stand on a plain down which ran a littl stream of good water
whereof tommi drank greedili we follow hi exampl to the right and
left of thi plain further than we could see stretch bushland over
which tower mani palm rather rag now becaus of the lash of
the gale look inland we perceiv that the ground slope gentli
downward end at a distanc of some mile in a larg lake far out
in thi lake someth like the top of a mountain of a brown colour
rose abov the water and on the edg of it wa what from that distanc
appear to be a tumbl ruin
thi is all veri interest i said to bicklei what do you make of
it
i dont quit know at first sight i should sai that we ar stand on
the lip of a crater of some vast extinct volcano look how it curv to
north and south and at the slope run down to the lake
i nod
lucki that the tidal wave did not get over the cliff i said if it
had the peopl here would have all been drown out i wonder where thei
have gone
as i spoke bastin point to the edg of the bush some hundr of yard
awai where we perceiv brown figur slip about among the tree i
suggest that we should go back to the mouth of our path so as to have
a line of retreat open in case of necess and await event so we did
and there stood still by degre the brown figur emerg on to the
plain to the number of some hundr and we saw that thei were both
male and femal the women were cloth in noth except flower and a
littl girdl the men were all arm with wooden weapon and also wore
a girdl but no flower the children of whom there were mani were
quit nake
among these peopl we observ a tall person cloth in what seem to
be a magnific feather cloak and walk around and about him a
number of grotesqu form adorn with hideou mask and basketlik
headdress that were surmount by plume
the king or chief and hi priest or medicinemen thi is splendid
said bicklei triumphantli
bastin also contempl them with enthusiasm as raw materi upon which
he hope to get to work
by degre and veri cautious thei approach us to our joi we
perceiv that behind them walk sever young women who bore wooden
trai of food or fruit
that look well i said thei would not make offer unless thei
were friendli
the food mai be poison remark bicklei suspici
the crowd advanc we stand quit still look as dignifi as we
could i as the tallest in the middl with tommi sit at my feet
when thei were about five and twenti yard awai howev that wretch
littl dog caught sight of the mask priest he growl and then
rush at them bark hi long black ear flap as he went
the effect wa instantan on and all thei turn and fled
precipit who evid had never befor seen a dog and look
upon it as a deadli creatur ye even the tall chief and hi mask
medicinemen fled like hare pursu by tommi who bit on of them in
the leg evok a terrif howl i call him back and took him into
my arm see that he wa safe for a while the crowd reform and onc
again advanc
as thei came we note that thei were a wonderfulli handsom peopl tall
and straight with regularli shape featur and noth of the negro
about them some of the young women might even be call beauti
though those who were elderli had becom corpul the feathercloth
chief howev wa much disfigur by a huge growth with a narrow stalk
to it that hung from hi neck and rest on hi shoulder
ill have that off him befor he is a week older said bicklei
survei thi deform with great profession interest
on thei came the girl with the platter walk ahead on on of these
were what look like joint of bake pork on anoth some plantain
and pearshap fruit thei knelt down and offer these to us we
contempl them for a while then bicklei shook hi head and began
to rub hi stomach with appropri contort clearli thei were
quickmind enough for thei saw the point at some word the girl
brought the platter to the chief and other who took from them
portion of the food at hazard and at them to show that it wa not
poison we watch their throat the while to make sure that it wa
swallow then thei return again and we took some of the food though
onli bicklei at becaus as i point out to him be a doctor who
understood the us of antidot clearli he should make the experi
howev noth happen inde he said that it wa veri good
after thi there came a paus then suddenli bastin took up hi parabl
in the polynesian tongu whichto a certain extenth had acquir
with so much pain
what is thi place call he ask slowli and distinctli paus
between each word
hi audienc shook their head and he tri again put the accent
on differ syllabl behold some bright spirit understood him and
answer
orofena
that mean a hill or an island or a hill in an island whisper
bicklei to me
who is your god ask bastin again
the point seem on upon which thei were a littl doubt but at last
the chief answer oro he who fight
in other word mar said bicklei
i will give you a better on said bastin in the same slow fashion
think that he refer to himself these children of natur
contempl hi angular form doubtfulli and shook their head then for
the first time on of the men who wa wear a mask and a wicker crate
on hi head spoke in a hollow voic sai
if you try oro will eat you up
head priest said bicklei nudg me old bastin had better be
care or he will get hi teeth into him and call them oro
anoth paus after which the man in a feather cloak with the growth on
hi neck that a servant wa support said
i am marama the chief of orofena we have never seen men like you
befor if you ar men what brought you here and with you that fierc
and terribl anim or evil spirit which make a nois and bite
now bicklei pretend to consult me who stood brood and majest
that is if i can be majest i whisper someth and he answer
the god of the wind and the sea
what nonsens ejacul bastin there ar no such thing
shut up i said we must us simil here to which he repli
i dont like simil that tamper with the truth
rememb neptun and aeolu i suggest and he laps into
consider of the point
we knew that you were come said marama our doctor told us all
about you a moon ago but we wish that you would come more gentli as
you nearli wash awai our countri
after look at me bicklei repli
how thank should you be that in our kind we have spare you
what do you come to do inquir marama again after the usual formula
of consult me bicklei answer
we come to take that mountain he meant lump off your neck and make
you beauti also to cure all the sick among your peopl
and i come broke in bastin to give you new heart
these announc evid caus great excit after
consult marama answer
we do not want new heart as the old on ar good but we wish to be
rid of lump and sick if you can do thi we will make you god
and worship you and give you mani wive here bastin held up hi hand
in horror when will you begin to take awai the lump
tomorrow said bicklei but learn that if you try to harm us we will
bring anoth wave which will drown all your countri
nobodi seem to doubt our capac in thi direct but on
inquir spirit in a wicker crate did ask how it came about that if we
control the ocean we had arriv in half a cano instead of a whole
on
bicklei repli to the effect that it wa becaus the god alwai
travel in halfcano to show their higher natur which seem to
satisfi everyon then we announc that we had seen enough of them for
that dai and would retir to think meanwhil we should be oblig if
thei would build us a hous and keep us suppli with whatev food thei
had
do the god eat ask the sceptic again
that fellow is a confound radic i whisper to bicklei tell him
that thei do when thei come to orofena
he did so whereon the chief said
would the god like a nice young girl cook
at thi point bastin retir down the path realis that he had to do
with cannib we said that we prefer to look at the girl aliv and
would meet them again tomorrow morn when we hope that the hous
would be readi
so our first interview with the inhabit of orofena came to an end
on which we congratul ourselv
on reach the remain of the star of the south we set to work to take
stock of what wa left to us fortun it prove to be a veri great
deal as i think i mention all the passeng part of the yacht lai
forward of the bridg just in front of which the vessel had been broken
in two almost as cleanli as though she were sever by a gigant
knife further our store were forward and practic everyth els
that belong to us even down to bicklei instrument and medicin
and bastin religi work to sai noth of a great quantiti of
tin food and groceri lastli on the deck abov the saloon had
stood two larg lifeboat although these were ampli secur at the
commenc of the gale on of them that on the port side wa smash
to smither probabl some spar had fallen upon it the starboard
boat howev remain intact and so far as we could judg seaworthi
although the bulwark were broken by the wave
there someth we can get awai in if necessari i said
where to remark bastin we dont know where we ar or if there is
ani other land within a thousand mile i think we had better stop here
as provid seem to have intend especi when there is so much
work to my hand
be care answer bicklei that the work to your hand doe not end
in the cut of all our throat it is an awkward thing interf
with the religion of savag and i believ that these untutor
children of natur sometim eat missionari
ye i have heard that said bastin thei bake them first as thei do
pig but i dont know that thei would care to eat me and he glanc
at hi boni limb especi when you ar much plumper anyhow on
cant stop for a risk of that sort
deign no repli bicklei walk awai to fetch some fine fish which
had been wash up by the tidal wave and were still flap about in
a littl pool of salt water then we took counsel as to how to make the
best of our circumst and as a result set to work to tidi up the
saloon and cabin which wa not difficult as what remain of the ship
lai on an even keel also we got out some necessari store includ
paraffin for the swing lamp with which the ship wa fit in case
of accid to the electr light candl and the gun we had brought
with us so that thei might be handi in the event of attack thi done
by the aid of the tool that were in the storeroom bicklei who wa an
excel carpent repair the saloon door all that wa necessari to
keep us privat as the bulkhead still remain
now he said triumphantli when he had finish and got the lock and
bolt to work to hi satisfact we can stand a sieg if need for
as the ship is iron built thei cant even burn us out and that teak door
would take some forc also we can shore it up
how about someth to eat i want my tea said bastin
then my reverend friend repli bicklei take a coupl of the fire
bucket and fetch some water from the stream also collect driftwood of
which there is plenti about clean those fish and grill them over the
saloon stove
ill try said bastin but i never did ani cook befor
no repli bicklei on second thought i will see to that myself
but you can get the fish readi
so with due precaut bastin and i fetch water from the stream
which we found flow over the edg of the cliff quit close at hand
into a beauti coral basin that might have been design for a bath of
the nymph inde on at a time while the other watch we undress
and plung into it and never wa a tub more welcom than after our
long dai of tempest then we return to find that bicklei had alreadi
set the tabl and wa engag in fry the fish veri skilfulli on the
saloon stove which prove to be well adapt to the purpos he wa
cross howev when he found that we had bath and that it wa now too
late for him to do likewis
while he wa clean himself as well as he could in hi cabin basin and
bastin wa boil water for tea suddenli i rememb the letter from
the danish mate jacobsen conclud that it might now be open as we
had certainli part with most of the star of the south for the last
time i read it it wa as follow
the reason honour sir that i am leav the ship is that on the
night i tore up the paper the spirit control the planchett wrote
these word after leav samoa the star of the south will be wreck
in a hurrican and everybodi on board drown except a b and b get
out of her get out of her dont be a fool jacob unless you want to
come over here at onc take our advic and get out of her and you will
live to be oldskol
sir i am not a coward but i know that thi will happen for that
spirit which sign itself skoll never tell a lie i did try to give
the captain a hint to stop at apia but he had been drink and openli
curs me and call me a sneak cheat so i am go to run awai
of which i am veri much asham but i do not wish to be drown yet as
there is a girl whom i want to marri and my mother i support you will
be safe and i hope you will not think too badli of mejacob jacobsen
psit is an aw thing to know the futur never try to learn
that
i gave thi letter to bastin and bicklei to read and ask them what
thei thought of it
coincid said bicklei the man is a weakmind idiot and heard
in samoa that thei expect a hurrican
i think chime in bastin that the devil know how to look after hi
own at ani rate for a littl while i dare sai it would have been much
better for him to be drown
at least he is a desert and fail in hi duti i never wish to hear
of him again i said
as a matter of fact i never have but the incid remain quit
unexplain either by bicklei or bastin
chapter vii the orofenan
to our shame we had a veri pleasant supper that night off the grill
fish which wa excel and some tin meat i sai to our shame in
a sens for on our companion the shark were sup and by right we
should have been sunk in woe i suppos that the sens of our own escap
intox us also notwithstand hi jovial none of us had
care much for the captain and hi polici had been to keep us somewhat
apart from the crew of whom therefor we knew but littl it is true
that bastin held servic on sundai for such as would attend and
bicklei had doctor a few of them for minor ailment but there except
for a littl casual convers our intercours began and end
now the sad fact is that it is hard to be overwhelm with grief for
those with whom we ar not intim we were veri sorri and that is all
that can be said except that bastin be high church announc in
a matteroffact wai that he meant to put up some petit for the
welfar of their soul to thi bicklei retort that from what he had
seen of their bodi he wa sure thei need them
ye it wa a pleasant supper not made less so by a bottl of champagn
which bicklei and i share bastin stuck to hi tea not becaus he did
not like champagn but becaus as he explain have now come
in contact with the heathen it would never do for him to set them an
exampl in the us of spiritu liquor
howev much we mai differ bastin i respect you for that sentiment
comment bicklei
i dont know why you should answer bastin but if so you might
follow my exampl
that night we slept like log trust to our teak door which we
barricad and to tommi who wa a most excel watchdog to guard
us against surpris at ani rate we took the risk as a matter of fact
noth happen though befor dawn tommi did growl a good deal for
i heard him but as he sank into slumber again on my bed i did not get
up in the morn i found from fresh footprint that two or three men
had been prowl about the ship though at a littl distanc
we rose earli and take the necessari precaut bath in the pool
then we breakfast and have fill everi avail receptacl with
water which took us a long time as these includ a larg tank that
suppli the bath so that we might have at least a week suppli in
case of sieg we went on deck and debat what we should do in the
end we determin to stop where we were and await event becaus as
i point out it wa necessari that we should discov whether these
nativ were hostil or friendli in the former event we could hold our
own on the ship wherea awai from it we must be overwhelm in the
latter there wa alwai time to move inland
about ten oclock when we were seat on stool smoke with our gun
by our sidefor here ow to the overhang cliff in which it will
be rememb the prow of the ship wa buri we could not be reach
by missil thrown from abovew saw number of the island advanc
upon us along the beach on either side thei were preced as befor
by women who bore food on platter and in basket these peopl
all talk excitedli and laugh after their fashion stop at a
distanc so we took no notic of them present marama clad in
hi feather cloak and again accompani by priest or medicinemen
appear walk down the path on the cliff face and stand below
made salut and enter into a convers with us of which i give
the substancethat is so far as we could understand it
he reproach us for not have come to him as he expect we would do
we repli that we prefer to remain where we were until we were sure
of our greet and ask him what wa the posit he explain that
onli onc befor in the time of hi grandfath had ani peopl reach
their shore also dure a great storm as we had done thei were
darkskin men like themselv three of them but whenc thei came
wa never known sinc thei were at onc seiz and sacrif to the
god oro which wa the right thing to do in such a case
we ask whether he would consid it right to sacrific us he repli
certainli unless we were too strong be god ourselv or unless an
arrang could be conclud we askedwhat arrang he repli
that we must make them gift also that we must do what we had promis
and cure himth chiefof the diseas which had torment him for
year in that event everyth would be at our dispos and we with
all our belong should becom taboo holi not to be touch none
would attempt to harm us noth should be stolen under penalti of
death
we ask him to come up on the deck with onli on companion that hi
sick might be ascertain and after much hesit he consent to
do so bicklei made an examin of the growth and announc that he
believ it could be remov with perfect safeti as the attach to
the neck wa veri slight but of cours there wa alwai a risk thi
wa explain to him with difficulti and much talk follow between
him and hi follow who gather on the beach beneath the ship thei
seem advers to the experi till marama grew furiou with them
and at last burst into tear sai that he could no longer drag thi
terribl burden about with him and he touch the growth he would
rather die then thei gave wai
i will tell the rest as shortli as i can
a hideou wooden idol wa brought on board wrap in leav and
feather and upon it the chief and hi head peopl swore safeti to
us whether he live or di make us the guest of their land there
were howev two proviso made or as such we understood them these
seem to be that we should offer no insult or injuri to their god and
secondli that we should not set foot on the island in the lake it wa
not till afterward that it occur to me that thi must refer to
the mountain top which appear in the inland sheet of water to those
stipul we made no answer inde the orofenan did all the
talk final thei ratifi their oath by a man who i suppos wa
a head priest cut hi arm and rub the blood from it on the lip
of the idol also upon those of the chief i should add that bastin had
retir as soon as he saw that fals god appear of which i wa glad
sinc i felt sure that he would make a scene
the oper took place that afternoon and on the ship for when onc
marama had made up hi mind to trust us he did so veri thoroughli it
wa perform on deck in the presenc of an aw multitud who watch
from the shore and when thei saw bicklei appear in a clean nightshirt
and wash hi hand utter a groan of wonder evid thei consid
it a magic and religi ceremoni inde ever afterward thei call
bicklei the great priest or sometim the great healer in later dai
thi wa a grievanc to bastin who consid that he had been rob
of hi proper titl especi when he learn that among themselv he
wa onli known as the bellow becaus of the loud voic in which he
address them nor did bicklei particularli appreci the compliment
with my help he administ the chloroform which wa done under
shelter of a sail for fear lest the peopl should think that we were
smother their chief then the oper went on to a satisfactori
conclus i omit the detail but an electr batteri and a redhot
wire came into plai
there said bicklei triumphantli when he had finish ty the
vessel and made everyth neat and tidi with bandag i wa afraid
he might bleed to death but i dont think there is ani fear of that
now for i have made a real job of it then advanc with the horrid
tumour in hi hand he show it in triumph to the crowd beneath who
groan again and threw themselv on to their face doubtless now it
is the most sacr relic of orofena
when marama came out of the anesthet bicklei gave him someth which
sent him to sleep for twelv hour dure all which time hi peopl
wait beneath thi wa our danger period for our difficulti wa
to persuad them that he wa not dead although bicklei had assur them
that he would sleep for a time while the magic work still i wa veri
glad when he woke up on the follow morn and two or three of
hi lead men could see that he wa aliv the rest wa lengthi but
simpl consist mere in keep him quiet and on a suitabl diet
until there wa no fear of the wound open we achiev it somehow
with the help of an intellig nativ woman who i suppos wa on
of hi wive and five dai later were enabl to present him heal
though rather totteri to hi affection subject
it wa a great scene which mai be imagin thei bore him awai in a
litter with the nativ woman to watch him and anoth to carri the relic
preserv in a basket and us thei acclaim as god thenceforward we
had noth to fear in orofenaexcept bastin though thi we did not
know at the time
all thi while we had been live on our ship and grow veri bore
there although we emploi the empti hour in convers with
select nativ therebi improv our knowledg of the languag
bicklei had the best of it sinc alreadi patient began to arriv which
occupi him on of the first wa that man whom tommi had bitten he
wa carri to us in an almost comatos state suffer appar from
the symptom of snake poison
afterward it turn out that he conceiv tommi to be a divin but most
venom lizard that could make a veri horribl nois and began to
suffer as on might do from the bite of such a creatur noth that
bicklei could do wa enough to save him and ultim he di in
convuls a circumst that enorm enhanc tommi reput
to tell the truth we took advantag of it to explain that tommi wa
in fact a supernatur anim a sort of tame demon which onli harm
peopl who had malevol intent toward those he serv or who
tri to steal ani of their possess or to intrud upon them at
inconveni hour especi in the dark so terribl wa he inde
that even the skill of the great priest ie bicklei could not avail
to save ani whom onc he had bitten in hi rage even to be bark at by
him wa danger and convei a curs that might last for gener
all thi we set out when bastin wa not there he had wander off
as he said to look for shell but as we knew to practis religi
orat in the polynesian tongu with the wave for audienc as
demosthen is said to have done to perfect himself as a polit
orat person i admit that i reli more on the terror of tommi to
safeguard us from theft and other troubl than i did upon those of the
nativ taboo and the priestli oath
the end of it all wa that we left our ship have padlock up the
door the padlock we explain wa a magic instrument that bit wors
than tommi and move inland in a kind of triumphal process
priest and singer go befor the orofenan sang extrem well and
minstrel follow after plai upon instrument like flute while
behind came the bearer carri such good as we need thei took
us to a beauti place in a grove of palm on a ridg where grew mani
breadfruit tree that command a view of the ocean upon on side and
of the lake with the strang brown mountain top on the other here in
the midst of the nativ garden we found that a fine hous had been
built for us of a kind of mud brick and thatch with palm leav
surround by a fenc courtyard of beaten earth and have wide
overhang verandah a veri comfort place inde in that delici
climat in it we took up our abod visit the ship occasion to
see that all wa well there and await event
for bicklei these soon began to happen in the shape of an
everincreas stream of patient the popul of the island wa
consider anyth between five and ten thousand so far as we
could judg and among these of cours there were a number of sick
ophthalmia for instanc wa a preval diseas as were the growth
such as marama had suffer from to sai noth of surgic case and
those result from accid or from nervou ailment with all of
these bicklei wa call upon to deal which he did with remark
success by help of hi book on tropic diseas and hi ampl suppli
of medic necessari
at first he enjoi it veri much but when we had been establish in
the hous for about three week he remark after put in a solid
ten hour of work that for all the holidai he wa get he might as
well be back at hi old practic with the differ that there he wa
earn sever thousand a year just then a poor woman arriv with a
babi in convuls to whose necess he wa oblig to sacrific
hi supper after which came a man who had fallen from a palm tree and
broken hi leg
nor did i escap sinc have somehow or other establish a reput
for wisdom as soon as i had master suffici of the languag everi
kind of knotti case wa laid befor me for decis in short i
becam a sort of chief justicenot an easi offic as it involv
the acquir of the nativ law which wa intric and peculiar
especi in matrimoni case
at these oppress activ bastin look on with a gloomi ey
you fellow seem veri busi he said on even but i can find
noth to do thei dont seem to want me and mere to set a good
exampl by drink water or tea while you swallow whiski and their palm
wine or whatev it is is veri neg kind of work especi as i
am get tire of plant thing in the garden and plai policeman
round the wreck which nobodi goe near even tommi is better off for at
least he can bark and hunt rat
you see said bicklei we ar follow our trade arbuthnot is a
lawyer and act as a judg i am a surgeon and i mai add a generala
veri generalpractition and work at medicin in an enorm and
muchneglect practic therefor you be a clergyman should go
and do likewis there ar some ten thousand peopl here but i do not
observ that as yet you have convert a singl on
thu spoke bicklei in a light and unguard moment with hi usual object
of what is known as get a rise out of bastin littl did he guess
what he wa do
bastin thought a while ponder then said
it is veri strang from what peculiar sourc provid sometim
send inspir if wisdom flow from babe and suckl why should
it not do so from the well of agnost and mocker
there is no reason which i can see scof bicklei except that as a
rule well do not flow
your jest is illtim and i mai add foolish continu bastin what
i wa about to add wa that you have given me an idea as it wa no
doubt intend that you should do i will metaphor speak gird
up my loin and try to bear the light into all thi heathen black
then it is on of the first you ever had old fellow but what the
need of gird up your loin in thi hot climat inquir bicklei
with innoc pyjama and that white and green umbrella of your
would do just as well
bastin vouchsaf no repli and sat for the rest of that even plung
in deep thought
on the follow morn he approach marama and ask hi leav
to teach the peopl about the god the chief readili grant thi
think i believ that he allud to ourselv and order were
issu accordingli thei were to the effect that bastin wa to be
allow to go everywher unmolest and to talk to whom he would about
what he would to which all must listen with respect
thu he began hi missionari career in orofena work at it good and
earnest man that he wa in a wai that excit even the admir of
bicklei he start a school for children which wa held under a fine
spread tree these listen well and be of exceedingli quick
intellect soon began to pick up the element of knowledg but when he
tri to persuad them to cloth their littl nake bodi hi failur
wa complet although after much supplic some of the bigger girl
did arriv with a chaplet of flowersround their neck
also he preach to the adult and here again wa veri success in
a wai especi after he becam more familiar with the languag thei
listen to a certain extent thei understood thei argu and put to
poor bastin the most aw question such as the whole bench of bishop
could not have answer still he did answer them somehow and thei
polit accept hi interpret of their theolog riddl i
observ that he got on best when he wa tell them stori out of the
old testament such as the account of the creation of the world and
of human be also of the delug etc inde on of their elder
saidy thi wa quit true thei had heard it all befor from
their father and that onc the delug had taken place round orofena
swallow up great countri but spare them becaus thei were so
good
bastin surpris ask them who had caus the delug thei repli
oro which wa the name of their god oro who dwelt yonder on the
mountain in the lake and whose represent thei worship in
idol he said that god dwelt in heaven to which thei repli with calm
certainti
no no he dwell on the mountain in the lake which wa why thei
never dare to approach that mountain
inde it wa onli by give the name oro to the divin and admit
that he might dwell in the mountain as well as everywher els that
bastin wa abl to make progress have conced thi not without
scrupl howev he did make consider progress so much in fact
that i perceiv that the priest of oro were begin to grow veri
jealou of him and of hi increas author with the peopl bastin
wa natur triumphant and even exclaim exultingli that within a
year he would have half of the popul baptis
within a year my dear fellow said bicklei you will have your
throat cut as a sacrific and probabl our also it is a piti too
as within that time i should have stamp out ophthalmia and some other
diseas in the island
here leav bastin and hi good work asid for a while i will sai
a littl about the countri from inform which i gather on some
journei that i made and by inquiri from the chief marama who had
becom devot to us i found that orofena wa quit a larg place in
shape the island wa circular a broad band of territori surround the
great lake of which i have spoken that in it turn surround a smaller
island from which rose the mountain top no other land wa known to
be near the shore of orofena which had never been visit by anyon
except the stranger a hundr year ago or so who were sacrif and
eaten most of the island wa cover with forest which the inhabit
lack the energi and inde had no tool to fell thei were an
extrem lazi peopl and would onli cultiv enough banana and other
food to satisfi their immedi need in truth thei live mostli upon
breadfruit and other product of the wild tree
thu it came about that in year of scarciti through drought or climat
caus which prevent the forest tree from bear thei suffer
veri much from hunger in such year hundr of them would perish
and the remaind resort to the dread expedi of cannib
sometim too the shoal of fish avoid their shore reduc them
to great miseri their onli domest anim wa the pig which roam
about half wild and in no great number for thei had never taken the
troubl to breed it in captiv their resourc therefor
were limit which account for the compar small of the
popul further reduc as it wa by a wick habit of infanticid
practis in order to lighten the burden of bring up children
thei had no tradit as to how thei reach thi land their belief
be that thei had alwai been there but that their forefath were
much greater than thei thei were poetic and sang song in a languag
which themselv thei could not understand thei said that it wa the
tongu their forefath had spoken also thei had sever strang
custom of which thei did not know the origin my own opinion which
bicklei share wa that thei were in fact a shrunken and deterior
remnant of some high race now come to it end through ag and
interbreed about them inde notwithstand their primit
savageri which in it qualiti much resembl that of other
polynesian there wa a veri curiou air of antiqu on felt that
thei had known the older world and it mysteri though now both
were forgotten also their languag which in time we came to speak
perfectli wa copiou music and express in it idiom
on circumst i must mention in walk about the countri i observ
all over it enorm hole some of them measur as much as a hundr
yard across with a depth of fifti feet or more and thi not on
alluvi land although there trace of them exist also but in solid
rock what thi rock wa i do not know as none of us were geologist
but it seem to me to partak of the natur of granit certainli
it wa not coral like that on and about the coast but of a primev
format
when i ask marama what caus these hole he onli shrug hi
shoulder and said he did not know but their father had declar that
thei were made by stone fall from heaven thi of cours suggest
meteorit to my mind i submit the idea to bicklei who in on of
hi rare interv of leisur came with me to make an examin
if thei were meteorit he said of which a shower struck the earth
in some past geolog ag all life must have been destroi by them
and their remain ought to exist at the bottom of the hole to me thei
look more like the effect of high explos but that of cours
is imposs though i dont know what els could have caus such
crater
then he went back to hi work for noth that had to do with antiqu
interest bicklei veri much the present and it problem were enough
for him he would sai who neither had live in the past nor expect to
have ani share in the futur
as i remain curiou i made an opportun to scrambl to the bottom
of on of these crater take with me some of the nativ with their
wooden tool here i found a good deal of soil either wash down from
the surfac or result from the decomposit of the rock though
oddli enough in it noth grew i direct them to dig after a while
to my astonish there appear a corner of a great work stone
quit unlik that of the crater inde it seem to me to be a marbl
further examin show that thi block wa most beautifulli carv
in basrelief appar with a design of leav and flower in the
disturb soil also i pick up a lifes marbl hand of a woman
exquisit finish and appar broken from a statu that might
have been the work of on of the great greek sculptor moreov on
the third finger of thi hand wa a represent of a ring whereof
unfortun the bezel had been destroi
i put the hand in my pocket but as dark wa come on i could not
pursu the research and disint the block when i wish to return the
next dai i wa inform polit by marama that it would not be safe
for me to do so as the priest of oro declar that if i sought to
meddl with the buri thing the god would grow angri and bring
disast on me
when i persist he said that at least i must go alon sinc no nativ
would accompani me and ad earnestli that he prai me not to go so
to my great regret and disappoint i wa oblig to give up the idea
chapter viii bastin attempt the martyr crown
that carv stone and the marbl hand took a great hold of my
imagin what did thei mean how could thei have come to the bottom
of that hole unless inde thei were part of some build and it
ornament which had been destroi in the neighbourhood the stone of
which we had onli uncov a corner seem far too big to have been
carri there from ani ship it must have weigh sever ton besid
ship do not carri such thing about the world and none had visit
thi island dure the last two centuri at ani rate or local
tradit would have record so wonder a fact were there then
onc edific cover with eleg carv stand on thi place and
were thei adorn with love statu that would not have disgrac
the best period of greek art the thing wa incred except on the
supposit that these were relic of an utterli lost civilis
bicklei wa as much puzzl as myself all he could sai wa that the
world wa infinit old and mani thing might have happen in it
whereof we had no record even bastin wa excit for a littl while
but as hi imagin wa repres by zero all he could sai wa
i suppos someon left them there and anyhow it doesnt matter much
doe it
but i who have certain lean toward the ancient and mysteri
could not be put off in thi fashion i rememb that unapproach
mountain in the midst of the lake and that on it appear to be
someth which look like ruin as seen from the top of the cliff
through glass at ani rate thi wa a point that i might clear up
sai noth to anybodi on morn i slip awai and walk to the
edg of the lake a distanc of five or six mile over rough countri
have arriv there i perceiv that the coneshap mountain in the
centr which wa about a mile from the lake shore wa much larger than
i had thought quit three hundr feet high inde and with a
veri larg circumfer further it side evid onc had been
terrac and it wa on on of these broad terrac halfwai up and
face toward the rise sun that the ruinlik remain were heap
i examin them through my glass undoubtedli it wa a cyclopean
ruin built of great block of colour stone which seem to have been
shatter by earthquak or explos there were the pillar of a mighti
gatewai and the remain of wall
i trembl with excit as i stare and stare could i not get to
the place and see for myself i observ that from the flat bushclad
land at the foot of the mountain ran out what seem to be the residu
of a stone pier which end in a larg tabletop rock between two
and three hundr feet across but even thi wa too far to reach by
swim besid for aught i knew there might be allig in that
lake i walk up and down it border till present i came to a path
which led into a patch of some varieti of cotton palm
follow thi path i discov a boathous thatch over with palm
leav insid it were two good cano with their paddl float and
ti to the stump of tree by fibr rope instantli i made up my mind
that i would paddl to the island and investig just as i wa about
to step into on of the cano the light wa cut off look up i saw
that a man wa crouch in the doorplac of the boathous in order to
enter and paus guiltili
friendfromthesea that wa the name that these island had given
to me said the voic of marama saywhat ar you do here
i am about to take a row on the lake chief i answer carelessli
inde friend have we then treat you so badli that you ar tire of
life
what do you mean i ask
come out into the sunlight friend and i will explain to you
i hesit till i saw marama lift the heavi wooden spear he carri
and rememb that i wa unarm then i came out
what doe all thi mean chief i ask angrili when we were clear of
the patch of cotton palm
i mean friend that you have been veri near to make a longer journei
than you thought have patienc now and listen to me i saw you leav
the villag thi morn and follow suspect your purpos ye
i follow alon sai noth to the priest of oro who fortun
were awai watch the bellow for their own reason i saw you
search out the secret of the mountain with those magic tube that
make thing big that ar small and thing that ar far off come near
and i follow you to the cano
all that is plain enough marama but why
have i not told you friendfromthesea that yonder hill which is
call orofena whenc thi island take it name is sacr
you said so but what of it
thi to set foot thereon is to die and i suppos great as you ar
you too can die like other at least although i love you had you
not come awai from that cano i wa about to discov whether thi is
so
then for what ar the cano us i ask with irrit
you see that flat rock friend with the hole beyond which is the
mouth of a cave that appear onli in the great storm that brought you
to our land thei ar us to convei offer which ar laid upon the
rock beyond it no man mai go and sinc the begin no man ha ever
gone
offer to whom
to the oromatua the spirit of the great dead who live there
oromatua oro it is alwai someth to do with oro who and what is
oro
oro is a god friend though it is true that the priest sai that abov
him there is a greater god call degai the creator the fate who made
all thing and direct all thing
veri well but why do you suppos that oro the servant of degai live
in that mountain i thought that he live in a grove yonder where your
priest as i am told have an imag of him
i do not know friendfromthesea but so it ha been held from the
begin the imag in the grove is onli visit by hi spirit from
time to time now i prai you come back and befor the priest discov
that you have been here and forget that there ar ani cano upon thi
lake
so think it wisest i turn the matter with a laugh and walk
awai with him to the villag on our road i tri to extract some more
inform but without success he did not know who built the ruin upon
the mountain or who destroi it he did not know how the terrac
came there all he knew wa that dure the convuls of natur which
result in the tidal wave that had thrown our ship upon the island
the mountain had been seen to quiver like a tree in the wind as though
within it great forc were at work then it wa observ to have risen
a good mani more feet abov the surfac of the lake as might be note
by the water mark upon the shore and then also the mouth of the cave
had appear the priest said that all thi wa becaus the oromatua
who dwelt there were stir which portend great thing inde
great thing had happenedfor had we not arriv in their land
i thank him for what he had told me and as there wa noth more
to be learn drop the subject which wa never mention between us
again at least not for a long while but in my heart i determin that
i would reach that mountain even though to do so i must risk my life
someth seem to call me to the place it wa as though i were be
drawn by a magnet
as it happen befor so veri long i did go to the mountain not of
my own will but becaus i wa oblig it came about thu on night i
ask bastin how he wa get on with hi missionari work he repli
veri well inde but there wa on great obstacl in hi path the idol
in the grove were it not for thi accurs imag he believ that the
whole island would becom christian i ask him to be more plain
he explain that all hi work wa thwart by thi idol sinc hi
convert declar that thei did not dare to be baptis while it sat
there in the grove if thei did the spirit that wa in it would bewitch
them and perhap steal out at night and murder them
the spirit be our friend the sorcer i suggest
that it arbuthnot do you know i believ those devilish men
sometim offer human sacrific to thi satan fetish when there is a
drought or anyth of that sort
i can quit believ it i answer but as thei will scarc remov
their god and with it their own livelihood and author i am afraid
that as we dont want to be sacrif there is noth to be done
at thi moment i wa call awai as i went i heard bastin mutter
someth about martyr but paid no attent littl did i guess
what wa go on in hi piou but obstin mind in effect it wa
thisthat if no on els would remov that idol he wa quit readi to
do it himself
howev he wa veri cun over that busi almost jesuit
inde not on word did he breath of hi dark plan to me and still
less to bicklei he just went on with hi teach lament from time
to time the stumblingblock of the idol and express wonder as to how
it might be circumv by a chang in the heart of the island or
otherwis sad as it is to record in fact dear old bastin went as near
to tell a fib in connect with thi matter as i suppos he had ever
done in hi life it happen thu on dai bicklei sharp ey caught
sight of bastin walk about with what look like a bottl of whiski
in hi pocket
hallo old fellow he said ha the selfdeni ordin broken
down i didnt know that you took peg on the sly and he point to
the bottl
if you ar insinu bicklei that i absorb spirit surreptiti
you ar more mistaken than usual which is sai a good deal thi
bottl contain not scotch whiski but paraffin although i admit
that it label mai have misl you unintention so far as i am
concern
what ar you go to do with the paraffin ask bicklei
bastin colour through hi tan and repli awkwardli
paraffin is veri good to keep awai mosquito if on can stand the
smell of it upon on skin not that i have brought it here with that
sole object the truth is that i am anxiou to experi with a lamp of
my own design madeumof nativ wood and he depart in a hurri
when next old bastin want to tell a lie comment bicklei he
should make up hi mind as to what it is to be and stick to it i
wonder what he is after with that paraffin not go to dose ani of
my patient with it i hope he wa argu the other dai that it is a
great remedi taken intern be quit unawar that the lamp varieti
is not us for that purpos
perhap he mean to swallow some himself just to show that he is
right i suggest
the stomachpump is at hand said bicklei and the matter drop
next morn i got up befor it wa light have some elementari
knowledg of the main fact of astronomi which remain with me from
boyhood when i had attend lectur on the subject which i had tri
to refresh by help of an encyclopedia i had brought from the ship
i wish to attempt to obtain an idea of our posit by help of the
star in thi endeavour i mai sai i fail absolut as i did not
know how to take a stellar or ani other observ
on my wai out of our nativ hous i observ by the lantern i carri
that the compart of it occupi by bastin wa empti and wonder
whither he had gone at that hour on arriv at my observationpost a
rocki emin on open ground where with tommi at my side i took my
seat with a telescop i wa astonish to see or rather to hear a great
number of the nativ walk past the base of the mound toward the
bush then i rememb that some on marama i think had inform me
that there wa to be a great sacrific to oro at dawn on that dai after
thi i thought no more of the matter but occupi myself in a futil
studi of the heavenli bodi at length the dawn broke and put a period
to my labour
glanc round me befor i descend from the littl hill i saw a flame
of light appear suddenli about half a mile or more awai among those
tree which i knew conceal the imag of oro on thi person i had
never had the curios to look as i knew that it wa onli a hideou
idol stuck over with feather and other bedizen the flame shot
suddenli straight into the still air and wa follow a few second
later by the sound of a dull explos after which it went out also it
wa follow by someth elsea scream of rage from an infuri mob
at the foot of the hill i stop to wonder what these sound might
mean then of a sudden appear bicklei who had been attend some
urgent case and ask me who wa explod gunpowd i told him that i
had no idea
then i have he answer it is that ass bastin up to some game now
i guess why he want that paraffin listen to the row what ar thei
after
sacrif bastin perhap i repli half in jest have you your
revolv
he nod we alwai wore our pistol if we went out dure the dark
hour
then perhap we had better go to see
we start and had not cover a hundr yard befor a girl whom
i recognis as on of bastin convert came fly toward us and
scream out help help thei kill the bellow with fire thei cook
him like a pig
just what i expect said bicklei
then we ran hard as evid there wa no time to lose while we went
i extract from the terrifi girl whom we forc to show us the wai
that as the sacrific wa about to be offer bastin had appear
and make fire appli it to the god oro who instantli burst into
flame then he ran back call out that the devil wa dead as he did
so there wa a loud explos and oro flew into piec hi burn
head went a long wai into the air and fall on to on of the priest
kill him thereon the other priest and the peopl seiz the bellow
and made him fast now thei were engag in heat an oven in which to
put him to cook when it wa readi thei would eat him in honour of oro
and serv him right too gasp bicklei who be stout wa not a
good runner why cant he leav other peopl god alon instead of
blow them up with gunpowd
dont know i answer hope we shall get there in time
to be cook and eaten with bastin wheez bicklei after which hi
breath gave out
as it chanc we did for these stone oven take a long time to heat
there by the edg of hi fieri grave with hi hand and leg bound in
palmfibr shackl stood bastin quit unmov smile inde in a
sort of seraph wai which irrit us both extrem round him danc
the infuri priest of oro and round them shriek and howl
with rage wa most of the popul of orofena we rush up so
suddenli that none tri to stop us and took our stand on either side
of him produc our pistol as we did so
thank you for come said bastin in the silenc which follow
though i dont think it is the least us i cannot recal that ani
of the earli martyr were ever roast and eaten though of cours
throw them into boil oil or water wa fairli common i take it
that the rite is sacrifici and even in a low sens sacrament not
mere on of common cannib
i stare at him and bicklei gasp out
if you ar to be eaten what doe it matter why you ar eaten
oh repli bastin there is all the differ in the world though
it is on that i cannot expect you to appreci and now pleas be
quiet as i wish to sai my prayer i imagin that those stone will be
hot enough to do their offic within twenti minut or so which is not
veri long
at that moment marama appear evid in a state of great
perturb with him were some of the priest or sorcer who were
danc about as i imagin the priest of baal must have done and
fill with furi thei roll their ey thei stuck out their tongu
thei utter weird cri and shook their wooden knive at the placid
bastin
what is the matter i ask sternli of the chief
thi friendfromthesea the bellow there when the sacrific
wa about to be offer to oro at the dawn rush forward and have
thrust someth between the leg of the imag of the god pour yellow
water over it and with fire caus it to burst into fierc flame then
he ran awai and mock the god who present with a loud report
flew into piec and kill that man therefor the bellow must be
sacrif
what to i ask the imag ha gone and the piec of it that
ascend fell not upon the bellow as would have happen if the god
had been angri with him but on on of it own priest whom it kill
therefor have been sacrif by the god itself he it is that
should be eaten not the bellow who mere did what hi spirit bade
him
thi ingeni argument seem to produc some effect upon marama but
to the priest it did not at all appeal
eat them all these cri thei ar the enemi of oro and have
work sacrileg
moreov to judg from their demeanour the bulk of the peopl seem
to agre with them thing began to look veri ugli the priest rush
forward threaten us with their wooden weapon and on of them even
aim a blow at bicklei which onli miss him by an inch or two
look here my friend call the doctor whose temper wa rise you
name me the great priest or great healer do you not well be care
lest i should show you that i can kill as well as heal
not in the least intimid by thi threat the man a great bedizen
fellow who liter wa foam at the mouth with rage rush forward
again hi club rais appar with the object of dash out
bicklei brain
suddenli bicklei lift hi revolv and fire the man shot through
the heart sprang into the air and fell upon hi faceston dead there
wa constern for these peopl had never seen us shoot anyth
befor and were quit unacquaint with the properti of firearm
which thei suppos to be mere instrument for make a nois thei
stare thei gasp in fear and astonish and then thei fled
pursu by tommi bark leav us alon with the two dead men
it wa time to teach them a lesson said bicklei as he replac the
empti cartridg and seiz the dead man roll him into the burn
pit
ye i answer but present when thei have got over their fright
thei will come back to teach us on
bastin said noth he seem too daze at the turn event had taken
what do you suggest ask bicklei
flight i answer
where toth ship we might hold that
no that is what thei expect look thei ar cut off our road
there to the island in the lake where thei dare not follow us for it
is holi ground
how ar we go to live on the island ask bicklei
i dont know i repli but i am quit certain that if we stai here
we shall die
veri well he said let us try it
while we were speak i wa cut bastin bond thank you he
said it is a great relief to stretch on arm after thei have been
compress with cord but at the same time i do not know that i am
realli grate the martyr crown wa hang abov me so to speak
and now it ha vanish into the pit like that man whom bicklei
murder
look here exclaim the exasper bicklei if you sai much more
bastin ill chuck you into the pit too to look for your martyr
crown for i think you have done enough mischief for on morn
if you ar try to shift the respons for that unfortun
man destruct on to me
oh shut it and trot broke in bicklei those infern savag ar
come with your bless convert lead the van
so we trot at no mean pace as we pass it bastin stoop down
and pick up the head of the imag of oro much as atalanta in academi
pictur is repres as do to the appl and bore it awai in
triumph
i know it is scorch he ejacul at interv but thei might
trim it up and stick it on to a new bodi as the origin fals god now
thei cant for there noth left
as a matter of fact we were never in ani real danger for our pursuit
wa veri halfheart inde to begin with now that their first rage
wa over the orofenan who were fond of us had no particular wish to do
us to death while the ardour of their sorcer who wish thi veri
much had been greatli cool by the mysteri annihil of their
idol and the violent death of two of their companion which thei
thought might be redupl in their own person so it came about
that the chase if noisi wa neither close nor eager
we reach the edg of the lake where wa the boathous of which i
have spoken alreadi travel at littl more than a walk here we
made bastin unfasten the better of the two cano that by good luck wa
almost fill with offer which doubtless accord to custom
must be made upon the dai of thi feast to oro while we watch against
surpris at the boathous door when he wa readi we slip in and
took our seat tommi jump in after us and push the cano now
veri heavili laden out into the lake
here at a distanc of about forti pace which we judg to be beyond
wooden spearthrow we rest upon our paddl to see what would happen
all the crowd of island had rush to the lake edg where thei stood
stare at us stupidli bastin think the occas opportun lift
the hideou head of the idol which he had carefulli wash and began to
preach on the downfal of the god of the grove
thi action of hi appear to awak memori or forebod in
the mind of hi congreg perhap some ancient propheci wa
concernedi do not know at ani rate on of the priest shout
someth whereon everybodi began to talk at onc then stoop down
thei threw water from the lake over themselv and rub it sand
and mud into their hair all the while make genuflexion toward the
mountain in the middl after which thei turn and depart
dont you think we had better go back ask bastin evid my
word have touch them and their mind ar melt beneath the light of
truth
oh by all mean repli bicklei with sarcasm for then their spear
will touch us and our bodi will soon be melt abov the fire of
that pit
perhap you ar right said bastin at least i admit that you have
made matter veri difficult by your unjustifi homicid of that
priest who i do not think meant to injur you serious and realli wa
not at all a bad fellow though opinion in some wai also i do not
suppos that anybodi is expect as it were to run hi head into the
martyr crown when it settl there of itself it is anoth matter
like a butterfli exclaim the enrag bicklei
ye if you like to put it that wai though the simil seem a veri
poor on like a sunbeam would be better
here bicklei gave wai with hi paddl so vigor that the cano wa
as nearli as possibl upset into the lake
in due cours we reach the flat rock of offer which prove to be
quit as wide as a doubl croquet lawn and much longer
what ar those i ask point to certain knob on the edg of the
rock at a spot where a curv project point made a littl harbour
bicklei examin them and answer
i should sai that thei ar the remain of stone mooringpost worn down
by mani thousand of year of weather ye look there is the cut of
the cabl upon the base of that on and veri big cabl thei must have
been
we stare at on anotherthat is bicklei and i did for bastin wa
still engag in contempl the blacken head of the god which he
had overthrown
chapter ix the island in the lake
we made the cano fast and land on the great rock to perceiv that it
wa realli a peninsula that is to sai it wa join to the main land
of the lake island by a broad roadwai quit fifti yard across which
appear to end in the mouth of the cave on thi causewai we note
a veri remark thing name two groov separ by an exact
distanc of nine feet which ran into the mouth of the cave and vanish
there
explain said bicklei
path i said worn by countless feet walk on them for thousand
of year
you should cultiv the art of observ arbuthnot what do you
sai bastin
he stare at the groov through hi spectacl and repli
i dont sai anyth except that i cant see anybodi to make path
here inde the place seem quit unpopul and all the orofenan
told me that thei never land on it becaus if thei did thei would die
it is a part of their superstiti nonsens if you have ani idea in
your head you had better tell us quickli befor we breakfast i am veri
hungri
you alwai ar remark bicklei even when most peopl appetit
might have been affect well i think that thi great plateau wa onc
a landingplac for fly machin and that there is the airsh or
garag
bastin stare at him
dont you think we had better breakfast he said there ar two roast
pig in that cano and lot of other food enough to last us a week
i should sai of cours i understand that the blood you have shed ha
thrown you off your balanc i believ it ha that effect except on the
most harden fly machin were onli invent a few year ago by the
brother wright in america
bastin said bicklei i begin to regret that i did not leav you to
take part in anoth breakfast yonderi mean as the princip dish
it wa provid not you who prevent it bicklei doubtless
becaus i am unworthi of such a gloriou end
then it is lucki that provid is a good shot with a pistol stop
talk nonsens and listen if those were path worn by feet thei
would run to the edg of the rock thei do not thei begin there in that
gentl depress and slope upward somewhat steepli the air machin
which were evid larg lit in the depress possibl as a bird
doe and then ran on wheel or sledg skid along the groov to the
airsh in the mountain come to the cave and you will see
not till we have breakfast said bastin i will get out a pig as a
matter of fact i had no supper last night as i wa take a class of
nativ boi and make some arrang of my own
as for me i onli whistl it all seem veri feasibl and yet how
could such thing be
we unload the cano and at bastin appetit wa splendid inde i
had to ask him to rememb that when thi suppli wa done i did not know
where we should find ani more
take no thought for the morrow he repli i have no doubt it will
come from somewher and he help himself to anoth chop
never had i admir him so much not a coupl of hour befor he wa
about to be cruelli murder and eaten but thi did not seem to affect
him in the least bastin wa the onli man i have ever known with a
realli perfect faith it is a qualiti worth have and on that
make for happi what a great thing not to care whether you ar
breakfast on or breakfast
i see that there is lot of driftwood about here he remark but
unfortun we have no tea so in thi climat it is of littl us
unless inde we can catch some fish and cook them
stop talk about eat and help us to haul up the cano said
bicklei
between the three of us we drag and carri the cano a long wai from
the lake fear lest the nativ should come and bear it off with our
provis then have given tommi hi breakfast off the scrap
we walk to the cave i glanc at my companion bicklei face wa
alight with scientif eager here ar not dream or specul
but fact to be learn it seem to sai and i will learn them the
past is go to show me some of it secret to tell me how men of long
ago live and di and how far thei had advanc to that point on the
road of civilis at which i stand in my littl hour of exist
that of bastin wa mildli interest no more obvious with half hi
mind he wa think of someth els probabl of hi convert on
the main island and of the school class fix for thi hour which
circumst prevent him from attend inde like lot wife he
wa cast glanc behind him toward the wick place from which he
had been forc to flee
neither the past nor the futur had much real interest for bastin ani
more than thei had for bicklei though for differ reason the former
wa done with the latter he wa quit content to leav in other hand
if he had ani clear idea thereof probabl that undiscov land
appear to him as a big pleasant place where ar no unbeliev or
erron doctrin and all sinner will be sternli repress
in which clad in a white surplic with all proper ecclesiast
trap he would argu etern with the earli father and in due
cours utterli annihil bicklei that is in a moral sens person
and as a man he wa extrem attach to bicklei as a necessari and
wronghead nuisanc to which he had becom accustom
and i what did i feel i do not know i cannot describ an
extraordinari attract a semispiritu exalt i think that
cave mouth might have been a magnet draw my soul with my bodi i
should have been afraid as i daresai i wa for our circumst were
suffici desper here we were castawai upon an island probabl
unchart on of thousand in the recess of a vast ocean from which
we had littl chanc of escap more have offend the religi
instinct of the primev inhabit of that island we had been forc
to flee to a rocki mountain in the centr of a lake where after the
food we had brought with us by accid wa consum we should no doubt
be forc to choos between death by starvat or if we attempt to
retreat at the hand of justli infuri savag yet these fact did
not oppress me for i wa be drawn drawn to i knew not what and if
it were to doomwel no matter
therefor none of us care bastin becaus hi faith wa equal to ani
emerg and there wa alwai that whiterob heaven wait for him
beyond which hi imagin did not go i often wonder whether he
pictur mr bastin as also wait if so he never said anyth
about her bicklei becaus as a child of the present and a servant of
knowledg he fear no futur believ it to be for him nonexist
and wa careless as to when hi strenuou hour of life should end and
i becaus i felt that yonder lai my true futur ye and my true past
even though to discov them i must pass through that portal which we
know as death
we reach the mouth of the cave it wa a vast place perhap the arch
of it wa a hundr feet high and i could see that onc all thi
arch had been adorn with sculptur protect as these were by the
overhang rock for the sculptur mouth of the cave wa cut deep into
the mountain face thei were still so worn that it wa imposs to
discern their detail time had eaten them awai like an acid but what
length of time i could not guess but it must have been stupend to
have work thu upon that hard and shelter rock
thi came home to me with ad forc when from subsequ examin
we learn that the entir mouth of thi cave had been seal up for
unnumb ag it will be rememb that marama told me the mountain
in the lake had risen much dure the fright cyclon in which we were
wreck and with it the cave mouth which previous had been invis
from the mark on the mountain side it wa obviou that someth of
the sort had happen veri recent at ani rate on thi eastern face
that is either the flat rock had sunk or the volcano had been thrown
upward
onc in the far past the cave had been as it wa when we found it then
it had gone down in such a wai that the tablerock entir seal the
entranc now thi entranc wa onc more open and although of cours
there wa a break in them the groov of which i have spoken ran on
into the cave at onli a slightli differ level from that at which thei
lai upon the flat rock and yet although thei had been thu shelter
by a great stone curtain in front of them still these sculptur
were worn awai by the tooth of time of cours howev thi mai have
happen to them befor thei were buri in some ancient cataclysm to
be thu resurrect at the hour of our arriv upon the island
without paus to make ani closer examin of these crumbl
carv we enter the yawn mouth of that great place follow
and inde walk in the deep groov that i have mention present
it seem to open out as a courtyard might at the end of a passag ye
to open on to some vast place whereof in that gloom we could not see the
roof or the limit all we knew wa that it must be enormousth echo
of our voic and footstep told us as much for these seem to come
back to us from high high abov and from far far awai bicklei and i
said noth we were too overcom but bastin remark
did you ever go to olympia i did onc to see a kind of plai where
the peopl said noth onli ran about dress up thei told me it wa
religi the sort of thing a clergyman should studi i didnt think it
religi at all it wa all about a nun who had a babi
well what of it snap bicklei
noth particular except that nun dont have babi or if thei do
the fact should not be advertis but i wasnt think of that i wa
think that thi place is like an underground olympia
oh be quiet i said for though bastin descript wa not bad hi
monoton drawl voic jar on me in that solemn
be care where you walk whisper bicklei for even he seem aw
there mai be pit in thi floor
i wish we had a light i said halt
if candl ar of ani us broke in bastin as it happen i have
a packet in my pocket i took them with me thi morn for a certain
purpos
not unconnect with the paraffin and the burn of the idol i
suppos said bicklei hand them over
ye if i had been allow a littl more time i intend
never mind what you intend we know what you did and that enough
said bicklei as he snatch the packet from bastin hand and proceed
to undo it ad by heaven i have no match nor have you
arbuthnot
i have a dozen box of wax vesta in my other pocket said bastin
you see thei burn so well when you want to get up a fire on a damp
idol as you mai have notic the dew is veri heavi here
in due cours these too were produc i took possess of them as thei
were too valuabl to be left in the charg of bastin and extract
a box from the packet lit two of the candl which were of the short
thick varieti like those us in carriagelamp
present thei burn up make two faint star of light which
howev were not strong enough to show us either the roof or the side
of that vast place by their aid we pursu our path still follow
the groov till suddenli these came to an end now all around us wa a
flat floor of rock which as we perceiv clearli when we push
asid the dust that had gather thickli on it in the cours of ag
doubtless from the gradual disintegr of the stoni wall had onc
been polish till it resembl black marbl inde certain crack
in the floor appear to have been fill in with some darkcolour
cement i stood look at them while bicklei wander off to the right
and a littl forward and present call to me i walk to him
bastin stick close to me as i had the other candl as did the littl
dog tommi who did not like these new surround and would not leav
my heel
look said bicklei hold up hi candl and tell mewhat that
befor me faintli shown wa some curiou structur of gleam rod
made of yellowish metal which rod appear to be connect by wire
the structur might have been forti feet high and perhap a hundr
long it bottom part wa buri in dust
what is that ask bicklei again
i made no answer for i wa think bastin howev repli
it difficult to be sure in thi light but i should think that it
mai be the remain of a cage in which some peopl who live here kept
monkei or perhap it wa an aviari look at those littl ladder for
the monkei to climb by or possibl for the bird to sit on
ar you sure it wasnt tame angel ask bicklei
what a ridicul remark how can you keep an angel in a cage i
aeroplan i almost whisper to bicklei
youv got it he answer the framework of an aeroplan and a jolli
larg on too onli why hasnt it oxidis
some indestruct metal i suggest gold for instanc doe not
oxidis
he nod and said
we shall have to dig it out the dust is feet thick about it we can do
noth without spade come on
we went round to the end of the structur whatev it might be and
present came to anoth again we went on and came to anoth all of
them be berth exactli in line
what did i tell you said bicklei in a voic of triumph a whole
garag full a regular fleet of aeroplan
that must be nonsens said bastin for i am quit sure that these
orofenan cannot make such thing inde thei have no metal and even
cut the throat of pig with wooden knive
now i began to walk forward bear to the left so as to regain our
former line we could do noth with these metal skeleton and i
felt that there must be more to find beyond present i saw someth
loom ahead of me and quicken my pace onli to recoil for there
not thirti feet awai and perhap three hundr yard from the mouth of
the cave suddenli appear what look like a gigant man tommi saw
it also and bark as dog do when thei ar frighten and the sound
of hi yap echo endlessli from everi quarter which scare him to
silenc recov myself i went forward for now i guess the truth
it wa not a man but a statu
the thing stood upon a huge base which lessen by success step
eight of them i think to it summit the foot of thi base mai have
been a squar of fifti feet or rather more the real support or pedest
of the statu howev wa onli a squar of about six feet the figur
itself wa littl abov lifes or at ani rate abov our lifes
sai seven feet in height it wa veri peculiar in sundri wai
to begin with noth of the bodi wa visibl for it wa swath like
a corps from these wrap project on arm the right in the hand
of which wa the like of a light torch the head wa not veil
it wa that of a man longnos thinlip sternvisag the
counten pervad by an aw and unutter calm as deep as that
of buddha onli less benign on the brow wa a wreath headdress not
unlik an eastern turban from which sprang two littl wing resembl
in some degre those on the famou greek head of hypno lord of sleep
between the fold of the wrap on the back sprang two other wing
enorm wing bent like those of a bird about to take flight inde
the whole attitud of the figur suggest that it wa spring from
earth to air it wa execut in black basalt or some stone of the sort
and veri highli finish for instanc on the bare feet and the arm
which held the torch could be felt everi muscl and even some of
the vein in the same wai the detail of the skull were perfectli
percept to the touch although at first sight not visibl on the
marbl surfac thi wa ascertain by climb on the pedest and
feel the face with our hand
here i mai sai that it model as well as that of the feet and the
arm fill bicklei who of cours wa a highli train anatomist with
absolut amaz he said that he would never have thought it possibl
that such accuraci could have been reach by an artist work in so
hard a materi
when the other had arriv we studi thi relic as close as our
two candl would allow and in turn express our opinion of it
signific bastin thought that if those thing down there were realli
the remain of aeroplan which he did not believ the statu had
someth to do with fly as wa shown by the fact that it had wing
on it head and shoulder also he ad after examin the face the
head wa uncommonli like that of the idol that he had blown up it had
the same long nose and sever shut mouth if he wa right thi wa
probabl anoth effigi of oro which we should do well to destroi at
onc befor the island came to worship it
bicklei ground hi teeth as he listen to him
destroi that he gasp destroi oh you youearli christian
here i mai state that bastin wa quit right as we prove subsequ
when we compar the head of the fetish which as it will be
rememb he had brought awai with him with that of the statu
allow for an enorm debas of art thei were essenti
ident in the facial characterist thi would suggest the descent
of a tradit through countless gener or of cours it mai have
been accident i am sure i do not know but i think it possibl that
for unknown centuri other old statu mai have exist in orofena from
which the idol wa copi or some dare and impiou spirit mai have
found hi wai to the cave in past ag and fashion the local god upon
thi ancient model
bicklei wa struck at onc as i had been with the resembl of the
figur to that of the egyptian osiri of cours there were differ
for instanc instead of the crook and the scourg thi divin held
a torch again in place of the crown of egypt it wore a wing
headdress though it is true thi wa not veri far remov from the
wing disc of that countri the wing that sprang from it shoulder
howev suggest babylonia rather than egypt or the assyrian bull
that ar similarli adorn all of these symbol idea might have
been taken from that figur but what wa it what wa it
in a flash the answer came to me a represent of the spirit of
death neither more nor less there wa the shroud there the cold
inscrut counten suggest mysteri that it hid but the torch
and the wing well the torch wa that which light soul to the other
world and on the wing thei flew thither whoever fashion that statu
hope for anoth life or so i wa convinc
i explain my idea bastin thought them fanci and prefer hi
notion of a fly man sinc by constitut he wa unabl to discov
anyth spiritu in ani religion except hi own bicklei agre that
it wa probabl an allegor represent of death but snif at
my interpret of the wing and the torch sinc by constitut he
could not believ that the folli of a belief in immort could have
develop so earli in the world that is among a highli civilis
peopl such as must have produc thi statu
what we could none of us understand wa why thi omin imag with it
dead cold face should have been place in an aerodrom nor in fact did
we ever discov possibl it wa there long befor the cave wa put to
thi us at first the place mai have been a templ and have so remain
until circumst forc the worshipp to chang their habit or
even their faith
we examin thi wondrou work and the pedest on which it stood as
close as we were abl by the dim light of our candl i wa anxiou
to go further and see what lai beyond it inde we did walk a few
pace twenti perhap onward into the recess of the cave
then bicklei discov someth that look like the mouth of a well
down which he nearli tumbl and bastin began to complain that he wa
hot and veri thirsti also to point out that he wish for no more cave
and idol at present
look here arbuthnot said bicklei these candl ar burn low and
we dont want to us up more if we can prevent it for we mai need what
we have got veri badli later on now accord to my pocket compass
the mouth of thi cave point due east probabl at the begin it wa
orient to the rise sun for purpos of astronom observ or
of worship at certain period of the year from the posit of the sun
when we land on the rock thi morn i imagin that just now it
rise almost exactli opposit to the mouth of the cave if thi is so
tomorrow at dawn for a time at least the light should penetr as
far as the statu and perhap further what i suggest is that we should
wait till then to explor
i agre with him especi as i wa feel tire be exhaust
by wonder and want time to think so we turn back as we did so i
miss tommi and inquir anxious where he wa be afraid lest he
might have tumbl down the welllik hole
he all right said bastin i saw him snif at the base of that
statu i expect there is a rat in there or perhap a snake
sure enough when we reach it there wa tommi with hi black nose
press against the lowest of the tier that form the base of the
statu and snif loudli also he wa scratch in the dust as a dog
doe when he ha wind a rabbit in a hole so engross wa he in thi
occup that it wa with difficulti that i coax him to leav the
place
i did not think much of the incid at that time but afterward it
came back to me and i determin to investig those stone at the
first opportun
pass the wreck of the machin we emerg on to the causewai
without accid after we had rest and wash we set to work to draw
our cano with it preciou burden of food right into the mouth of the
cave where we hid it as well as we could
thi done we went for a walk round the base of the peak thi prove
to be a great deal larger than we had imagin over two mile in
circumfer inde all about it wa a belt of fertil land as i
suppos deposit there by the water of the great lake and result
from the decai of veget much of thi belt wa cover with
ancient forest end in mud flat that appear to have been thrown
up recent perhap at the time of the tidal wave which bore us to
orofena on the higher part of the belt were mani of the extraordinari
craterlik hole that i have mention as be preval on the main
island inde the place had all the appear of have been subject
to a terrif and continu bombard
when we had complet it circuit we set to work to climb the peak in
order to explor the terrac of which i have spoken and the ruin
which i had seen through my fieldglass it wa quit true thei were
terrac cut with infinit labour out of the solid rock and on them
had onc stood a citi now pound into dust and fragment we struggl
over the broken block of stone to what we had taken for a templ which
stood near the lip of the crater for without doubt thi mound wa an
extinct volcano or rather it crest all we could make out when we
arriv wa that here had onc stood some great build for it court
could still be trace also there lai about fragment of step and
pillar
appar the latter had onc been carv but the passag of
innumer ag had obliter the work and we could not turn these
great block over to discov if ani remain beneath it wa as though
the god thor had broken up the edific with hi hammer or jove had
shatter it with hi thunderbolt noth els would account for that
utter wreck except as bicklei remark significantli the scientif
us of high explos
follow the line of what seem to have been a road we came to the
edg of the volcano and found as we expect the usual depress out
of which fire and lava had onc been cast as from hecla or vesuviu it
wa now a lake more than a quarter of a mile across inde it had been
thu in the ancient dai when the build stood upon the terrac for
we saw the remain of step lead down to the water perhap it had
serv as the sacr lake of the templ
we gaze with wonder and then weari out scrambl back through
the ruin which by the wai were of a differ stone from the lava of
the mountain to the mouth of the great cave
chapter x the dweller in the tomb
by now it wa draw toward sunset so we made such prepar as we
could for the night on of these wa to collect dry driftwood of
which an abund lai upon the shore to serv us for fire though
unfortun we had noth that we could cook for our meal
while we were thu engag we saw a cano approach the tablerock and
perceiv that in it were the chief marama and a priest after hover
about for a while thei paddl the cano near enough to allow of
convers which take no notic of their presenc we left it to
them to begin
o friendfromthesea call marama address myself we come
to prai you and the great healer to return to us to be our guest as
befor the peopl ar cover with dark becaus of the loss of your
wisdom and the sick cry aloud for the healer inde two of those whom
he ha cut with knive ar dy
and what of the bellow i ask indic bastin
we should like to see him back also friendfromthesea that we mai
sacrific and eat him who destroi our god with fire and caus the
healer to kill hi priest
that is most unjust exclaim bastin i deepli regret the blood that
wa shed on the occas unnecessarili as i think
then go and aton for it with your own said bicklei and everybodi
will be pleas
wave to them to be silent i said
ar you mad marama that you should ask us to return to sojourn among
peopl who tri to kill us mere becaus the bellow caus fire to
burn an imag of wood and it head to fly from it shoulder just to
show you that it had no power to hold itself togeth although you call
it a god not so we wash our hand of you we leav you to go your
own wai while we go our till perchanc in a dai to come after mani
misfortun have overtaken you you creep about our feet and with
prayer and offer beg us to return
i paus to observ the effect of my word it wa excel for both
marama and the priest wrung their hand and groan then i went on
meanwhil we have someth to tell you we have enter the cave where
you said no man might set a foot and have seen him who sit within
the true god here bastin tri to interrupt but wa suppress by
bicklei
thei look at each other in a frighten wai and groan more loudli
than befor
he send you a messag which as he told us of your approach we came
to the shore to deliv to you
how can you sai that began bastin but wa again violent suppress
by bicklei
it is that he the real oro rejoic that the fals oro whose face is
copi from hi face ha been destroi it is that he command you dai
by dai to bring food in plenti and lai it upon the rock of offer
not forget a suppli of fresh fish from the sea and with it all
those thing that ar store in the hous wherein we the stranger
from the sea deign to dwell awhil until we left you becaus in your
wicked you wish to murder us
and if we refusewhat then ask the priest speak for the first
time
then oro will send death and destruct upon you then your food shall
fail and you shall perish of sick and want and the oromatua the
spirit of the great dead shall haunt you in your sleep and oro shall
eat up your soul
at these horribl threat both of them utter a kind of wail after
which marama ask
and if we consent what then friendfromthesea
then perchanc i answer in some dai to come we mai return to
you that i mai give you of my wisdom and the great healer mai cure your
sick and the bellow mai lead you through hi gate and in hi kind
make you to see with hi ey
thi last claus of my ultimatum did not seem to appeal to the priest
who argu a while with marama though what he said we could not hear
in the end he appear to give wai at ani rate marama call out that
all should be done as we wish and that meanwhil thei prai us
to interced with oro in the cave and to keep back the ghost from
haunt them and to protect them from misfortun i repli that we
would do our best but could guarante noth sinc their offenc wa
veri great
then to show that the convers wa at an end we walk awai with
digniti push bastin in front of us lest he should spoil the effect
by some of hi illtim and often overtru remark
that capit said bicklei when we were out of hear the enemi
ha capitul we can stop here as long as we like provis from
the mainland and if for ani reason we wish to leav be sure of our
line of retreat
i dont know what you call capit exclaim bastin it seem to me
that all the li which arbuthnot ha just told ar suffici to bring
a judgment upon us inde i think that i will go back with marama and
explain the truth
i never befor knew anybodi who wa so anxiou to be cook and eaten
remark bicklei moreov you ar too late for the cano is a
hundr yard awai by now and you shant have our rememb the
paulin maxim old fellow which you ar so fond of quot and be all
thing to all men and anoth that is more modern that when you ar at
rome you must do as the roman do also a third that necess ha no
law and for the matter of that a fourth that all is fair in love and
war
i am sure bicklei that paul never meant hi word to bear the debas
sens which you attribut to them began bastin but at thi point i
hustl him off to light a firea process at which i point out he had
shown himself an expert
we slept that night under the overhang rock just to on side of the
cave not in the mouth becaus of the draught which drew in and out
of the great place in that soft and balmi clime thi wa no hardship
although we lack blanket and yet tire though i wa i could
not rest as i should have done bastin snore awai contentedli quit
unaffect by hi escap which to him wa mere an incid in the
dai work and so too slumber bicklei except that he did not
snore but the amaz and the mysteri of all that we had discov
and of all that might be left for us to discov held me back from
sleep
what did it mean what could it mean my nerv were taut as harp
string and seem to vibrat to the touch of invis finger
although i could not interpret the music that thei made onc or twice
also i thought i heard actual music with my physic ear and that of a
strang qualiti soft and low and dream it appear to well from the
recess of the vast cave a wail song in an unknown tongu from the
lip of women or of a woman multipli mysteri by echo thi
howev must have been pure fanci sinc there wa no singer there
present i doze off to be awaken by the sudden sound of a great
fish leap in the lake i sat up and stare fear lest it might be
the splash of a paddl for i could not put from my mind the possibl
of attack all i saw howev wa the low line of the distant shore
and abov it the bright and set star that herald the come of
the sun then i woke the other and we wash and at sinc onc the
sun rose time would be preciou
at length it appear splendid in a cloudless sky and as i had hope
directli opposit to the mouth of the cave take our candl and some
stout piec of driftwood which with our knive we had shape on the
previou even to serv us as lever and rough shovel we enter the
cave bicklei and i were fill with excit and hope of what we knew
not but bastin show littl enthusiasm for our quest hi heart wa
with hi halfconvert savag beyond the lake and of them quit
rightli i have no doubt he thought more than he did of all the
archaeolog treasur in the whole earth still he came bear the
blacken head of oro with him which with unconsci humour he had
us as a pillow through the night becaus as he said it wa after
all softer than stone also i believ that in hi heart he hope
that he might find an opportun of destroi the bigger and earlier
edit of oro in the cave befor it wa discov by the nativ
who might wish to make it an object of worship tommi came also with
greater alacr than i expect sinc dog do not as a rule like dark
place when we reach the statu i learn the reason he rememb
the smell he had detect at it base on the previou dai which
bastin suppos to proce from a rat and wa anxiou to continu hi
investig
we went straight to the statu although bicklei pass the halfburi
machin with evid regret as we had hope the strong light of
the rise sun fell upon it in a vivid rai reveal all it wondrou
workmanship and the majestyfor no other word describ itof the
somewhat terrifi counten that appear abov the wrap of the
shroud inde i wa convinc that origin thi monument had been
place here in order that on certain dai of the year the sun might
fall upon it thu when probabl worshipp assembl to ador their
hallow symbol after all thi wa common in ancient dai wit
the instanc of the aw three who sit in the deepest recess of the
templ of abu simbel on the nile
we gaze and gaze our fill at least bicklei and i did for bastin wa
occupi in make a care comparison between the head of hi wooden
oro and that of the statu
there is no doubt that thei ar veri much alik he said why
whatev is that dog do i think it is go mad and he point to
tommi who wa dig furious at the base of the lowest step as at
home i have seen him do at root that shelter a rabbit
tommi energi wa so remark that at length it serious attract
our attent evid he meant that it should do so for occasion
he sprang back to me bark then return and snif and scratch
bicklei knelt down and smelt at the stone
it is an odd thing humphrei he said but there is a strang odour
here a veri pleasant odour like that of sandalwood or attar of rose
i never heard of a rat that smelt like sandalwood or attar of rose
said bastin look out that it isnt a snake
i knelt down besid bicklei and in clear awai the deep dust from
what seem to be the bottom of the step which wa perhap four feet
in height by accid thrust my amateur spade somewhat strongli against
it base where it rest upon the rocki floor
next moment a wonder came to pass the whole massiv rock began to turn
outward as though upon a pivot i saw it come and grab bicklei by
the collar drag him back so that we just roll clear befor the
great block which must have weigh sever ton fell down and crush
us tommi saw it too and fled though a littl late for the edg
of the block caught the tip of hi tail and caus him to emit a most
pierc howl but we did not think of tommi and hi woe we did not
think of our own escap or of anyth els becaus of the marvel that
appear to us seat there upon the ground after our backward tumbl
we could see into the space which lai behind the fallen step for there
the light of the sun penetr
the first idea it gave me wa that of the jewel shrine of some
mediaev saint which by good fortun had escap the plunder
there ar still such exist in the world it shone and glitter
appar with gold and diamond although as a matter of fact there
were no diamond nor wa it gold which gleam but some ancient metal
or rather amalgam which is now lost to the world the same that wa
us in the tube of the airmachin i think that it contain gold
but i do not know at ani rate it wa equal last and even more
beauti though lighter in colour
for the rest thi adorn recess which resembl that of a larg funer
vault occupi the whole space beneath the base of the statu that wa
support on it arch wa empti save for two flash object that lai
side by side but with nearli the whole width of the vault between them
i point at them to bicklei with my finger for realli i could not
speak
coffin by jove he whisper glass or crystal coffin and peopl
in them come on
a few second later we were crawl into that vault while bastin still
nurs the head of oro as though it were a babi stood confus outsid
mutter someth about desecr hallow grave
just as we reach the interior ow to the heighten of the
sun the light pass awai leav us in a kind of twilight bicklei
produc carriag candl from hi pocket and fumbl for match while
he wa do so i notic two thingsfirstli that the place realli did
smell like a scentshop and secondli that the coffin seem to glow
with a kind of phosphoresc light of their own not veri strong but
suffici to reveal their outlin in the gloom then the candl burnt
up and we saw
within the coffin that stood on our left hand as we enter for thi
crystal wa as transpar as plate glass lai a most wonder old man
clad in a gleam embroid robe hi long hair which wa part
in the middl as we could see beneath the edg of the pearlsewn and
broider cap he wore also hi beard were snowi white the man wa
tall at least six feet four inch in height and rather spare hi
hand were long and thin veri delic made as were hi sandal
feet
but it wa hi face that fix our gaze for it wa marvel like the
face of a god and as we notic at onc with some resembl to
that of the statu abov thu the brow wa broad and massiv the nose
straight and long the mouth stern and clearcut while the cheekbon
were rather high and the eyebrow arch such ar the characterist
of mani handsom old men of good blood and as the mummi of seti and
other show us such thei have been for thousand of year onli thi
man differ from all other becaus of the fear digniti stamp upon
hi featur look at him i began to think at onc of the prophet
elijah as he must have appear rise to heaven enhanc by the
more earthli glori of solomon for although the appear of these
patriarch is unknown of them on conceiv idea onli it seem
probabl that elijah mai have look more benign here there wa no
benign onli terribl forc and infinit wisdom
contempl him i shiver a littl and felt thank that he wa
dead for to tell the truth i wa afraid of that awesom counten
which i should add wa of the white of paper although the cheek
still show ting of colour so perfect wa the preserv of the
corps
i wa still gaze at it when bicklei said in a voic of amaz
i sai look here in the other coffin
i turn look and nearli collaps on the floor of the vault sinc
beauti can sometim strike us like a blow oh there befor me lai all
loveli such loveli that there burst from my lip an involuntari
cry
ala that she should be dead
a young woman i suppos at least she look young perhap five or
six and twenti year of ag or so i judg there she lai her tall and
delic shape half hidden in mass of richhu hair in colour of a
ruddi black i know not how els to describ it sinc never have i
seen ani of the same tint moreov it shone with a life of it own
as though it had been dust with gold from between the mass of
thi hair appear a face which i can onli call divin there wa everi
beauti that woman can boast from the curv eyelash of extraordinari
length to the sweet and human mouth to these charm also were ad
a wondrou smile and an air of kind digniti veri differ from the
fierc pride stamp upon the counten of the old man who wa her
companion in death
she wa cloth in some closefit robe of white broider with gold
pearl were about her neck ly far down upon the perfect bosom a
girdl of gold and shine gem encircl her slender waist and on her
littl feet were sandal fasten with red stone like rubi in
truth she wa a splendid creatur and yet i know not how her beauti
suggest more of the spirit than of the flesh inde in a wai it wa
unearthli my sens were smitten it pull at my heartstr and
yet it unutter strang seem to awak memori within me
though of what i could not tell a wild fanci came to me that i must
have known thi heavenli creatur in some past life
by now bastin had join us and attract by my exclam and by
the attitud of bicklei who wa stare down at the coffin with a fix
look upon hi face not unlik that of a pointer when he scent game he
began to contempl the wonder within it in hi slow wai
well i never he said do you think the glitter ladi in there is
human
the glitter ladi is dead but i suppos that she wa human in her
life i answer in an aw whisper
of cours she is dead otherwis she would not be in that glass coffin
i think i should like to read the burial servic over her which i
daresai wa never done when she wa put in there
how do you know she is dead ask bicklei in a sharp voic and
speak for the first time i have seen hundr of corps and
mummi too but never ani that look like these
i stare at him it wa strang to hear bicklei the scoffer at
miracl suggest that thi greatest of all miracl might be
possibl
thei must have been here a long time i said for although human
thei ar not i think of ani peopl known to the world todai their
dress everyth show it though perhap thousand of year ago
and i stop
quit so answer bicklei i agre that is why i suggest that thei
mai have belong to a race who knew what we do not name how to
suspend anim for great period of time
i said no more nor did bastin who wa now engag in studi the old
man and for onc wonderstruck and overcom bicklei howev took on
of the candl and began to make a close examin of the coffin
so did tommi who snif along the join of that of the glitter ladi
until hi nose reach a certain spot where it remain while hi
black tail began to wag in a delight fashion bicklei push him awai
and investig
as i thought he saidairhol see
i look and there bore through the crystal of the coffin in a line
with the face of it occup were a number of littl hole that either
by accid or design outlin the shape of a human mouth
thei ar not airtight murmur bicklei and if air can enter how
can dead flesh remain like that for ag
then he continu hi search upon the other side
the lid of thi coffin work on hing he said here thei ar
fashion of the crystal itself a live person within could have
pull it down befor the sens depart
no i answer for look here is a crystal bolt at the end and it is
shot from without
thi puzzl him then as though struck by an idea he began to examin
the other coffin
iv got it he exclaim present the old god in here somehow
we all thought of thi old man as not quit normal shut down the
glitter ladi coffin and bolt it hi own is not bolt although
the bolt exist in the same place he just got in and pull down the
lid oh what nonsens i am talkingfor how can such thing be let us
get out and think
so we crept from the sepulchr in which the perfum air had begun to
oppress us and sat ourselv down upon the floor of the cave where for
a while we remain silent
i am veri thirsti said bastin present those smell seem to have
dri me up i am go to get some teai mean water as unfortun
there is no tea and he set off toward the mouth of the cave
we follow him i dont quit know why except that we wish to
breath freeli outsid also we knew that the sepulchr and it content
would be as safe as thei had been forwel how long
it prove to be a beauti morn outsid we walk up and down
enjoi it subconsci for realli ourthat is bicklei and my
ownintellig were concentr on that sepulchr and it content
where bastin mai have been i do not know perhap in a visionari
teapot sinc i wa sure that it would take him a dai or two to
appreci the signific of our discoveri at ani rate he wander
off make no remark about them to drink water i suppos
present he began to shout to us from the end of the tablerock and we
went to see the reason of hi nois it prove to be veri satisfactori
for while we were in the cave the orofenan had brought absolut
everyth belong to us togeth with a larg suppli of food from
the main island not a singl articl wa miss even our book a can
with the bottom out and the broken piec of a littl pocket mirror
had been religi transport and with these a few articl that had
been stolen from us notabl my pocketknif evid a great taboo
had been laid upon all our possess thei were now carefulli arrang
in on of the groov of the rock that bicklei suppos had been made by
the wheel of aeroplan which wa why we had not seen them at onc
each of us rush for what we desir mostbastin for on of the
canist of tea i for my diari and bicklei for hi chest of
instrument and medicin these were remov to the mouth of the cave
and after them the other thing and the food also a bell tent and some
camp furnitur that we had brought from the ship then bastin made some
tea of which he drank four larg pannikin have first said grace over
it with unwont fervour nor did we disdain our share of the beverag
although bicklei prefer cocoa and i coffe cocoa and coffe we had
no time to make then and in view of that sepulchr in the cave what
had we to do with cocoa and coffe
so bicklei and i said to each other and yet present he chang hi
mind and in a special metal machin carefulli made some extrem strong
black coffe which he pour into a thermo flask previous warm
with hot water ad thereto about a claret glass of brandi also he
extract certain drug from hi medicinechest and with them as i
note a hypoderm syring which he first boil in a kettl and then
shut up in a littl tube with a glass stopper
these prepar finish he call to tommi to give him the scrap
of our meal but there wa no tommi the dog wa miss and though we
hunt everywher we could not find him final we conclud that he
had wander off down the beach on busi of hi own and would return
in due cours we could not bother about tommi just then
after make some further prepar and fidget about a littl
bicklei announc that as we had now some proper paraffin lamp of the
power sort which ar known as hurrican he propos by their aid
to carri out further examin in the cave
i think i shall stop where i am said bastin help himself from the
kettl to a fifth pannikin of tea those corps ar veri interest
but i dont see ani us in stare at them again at present on can
alwai do that at ani time i have miss marama onc alreadi by be
awai in that cave and i have a lot to sai to him about my peopl i
dont want to be absent in case he should return
to wash up the thing i suppos said bicklei with a sniff or
perhap to eat the tealeav
well as a matter of fact i have notic that these nativ have
a peculiar tast for tealeav i think thei believ them to be a
medicin but i dont suppos thei would come so far for them though
perhap thei might in the hope of get the head of oro anyhow i am
go to stop here
prai do said bicklei ar you readi humphrei
i nod and he hand to me a feltcov flask of the nonconduct
kind fill with boil water a tin of preserv milk and a littl
bottl of meat extract of a most concentr sort then have lit two
of the hurrican lamp and seen that thei were full of oil we start
back up the cave
chapter xi resurrect
we reach the sepulchr without stop to look at the park machin
or even the marvel statu that stood abov it for what did we care
about machin or statu now as we approach we were astonish to
hear low and cavern growl
there is some wild beast in there said bicklei halt no by
georg it tommi what can the dog be after
we peep in and there sure enough wa tommi ly on the top of
the glitter ladi coffin and growl hi veri best with the hair
stand up upon hi back when he saw who it wa howev he jump
off and frisk round lick my hand
that veri strang i exclaim
not stranger than everyth els said bicklei
what ar you go to do i ask
open these coffin he answer begin with that of the old god
sinc i would rather experi on him i expect he will crumbl into
dust but if by chanc he doesnt ill jam a littl strychnin mix
with some other drug of which you dont know the name into on of
hi vein and see if anyth happen if it doesnt it wont hurt him
and if it doeswel who know now give me a hand
we went to the lefthand coffin and by insert the hook on the back of
my knife of which the real us is to pick stone out of hors hoof
into on of the littl airhol i have describ manag to rais the
heavi crystal lid suffici to enabl us to forc a piec of wood
between it and the top the rest wa easi for the hing be of
crystal had not corrod in two minut it wa open
from the chest came an overpow spici odour and with it a verit
breath of warm air befor which we recoil a littl bicklei took a
pocket thermomet which he had at hand and glanc at it it mark a
temperatur of 82 degre in the sepulchr have note thi he thrust
it into the coffin between the crystal wall and it occup then we
went out and wait a littl while to give the odour time to dissip
for thei made the head reel
after five minut or so we return and examin the thermomet it
had risen to 98 degre the natur temperatur of the human bodi
what do you make of that if the man is dead he whisper
i shook my head and as we had agre set to help him to lift the
bodi from the coffin it wa a good weight quit eleven stone i should
sai moreov it wa not stiff for the hip joint bent we got it out
and laid it on a blanket we had spread on the floor of the sepulchr
whilst i wa thu engag i saw someth that nearli caus me to loos
my hold from astonish beneath the head the centr of the back and
the feet were crystal box about eight inch squar or rather crystal
block for in them i could see no open and these box emit a
faint phosphoresc light i touch on of them and found that it wa
quit warm
great heaven i exclaim here magic
there no such thing answer bicklei in hi usual formula then an
explan seem to strike him and he ad not magic but radium
or someth of the sort that how the temperatur wa kept up in
suffici quantiti it is practic indestruct you see my word
thi old gentleman knew a thing or two
again we wait a littl while to see if the bodi begun to crumbl on
exposur to the air i take the opportun to make a rough sketch of
it in my pocketbook in anticip of that event but it did not it
remain quit sound
here goe said bicklei if he should be aliv he will catch cold in
hi lung after ly for ag in that babi incub as i suppos he
ha done so it is now or never
then bid me hold the man right arm he took the steril syring
which he had prepar and thrust the needl into a vein he select
just abov the wrist inject the content
it would have been better over the heart he whisper but i thought
i would try the arm first i dont like risk chill by uncov
him
i made no answer and again we wait and watch
great heaven he stir i gasp present
stir he wa for hi finger began to move
bicklei bent down and place hi ear to the hearti forgot to sai that
he had test thi befor with a stethoscop but had been unabl to
detect ani movement
i believ it is begin to beat he said in an aw voic
then he appli the stethoscop and ad it is it is
next he took a filament of cotton wool and laid it on the man lip
present it move he wa breath though veri faintli bicklei took
more cotton wool and have pour someth from hi medicinechest on
to it place it over the mouth beneath the man nostrilsi believ it
wa sal volatil
noth further happen for a littl while and to reliev the strain
on my mind i stare absent into the empti coffin here i saw what had
escap our notic two small plate of white metal and cut upon them
what i took to be star map beyond these and the glow box which i
have mention there wa noth els in the coffin i had no time to
examin them for at that moment the old man open hi mouth and began
to breath evid with some discomfort and effort as hi empti
lung fill themselv with air then hi eyelid lift reveal a
wonder pair of dark glow ey beneath next he tri to sit up but
would have fallen had not bicklei support him with hi arm
i do not think he saw bicklei inde he shut hi ey again as though
the light hurt them and went into a kind of faint then it wa that
tommi who all thi while had been watch the proceed with grave
interest came forward wag hi tail and lick the man face
at the touch of the dog red tongu he open hi ey for the second
time now he sawnot us but tommi for after contempl him for a
few second someth like a smile appear upon hi fierc but nobl
face more he lift hi hand and laid it on the dog head as
though to pat it kindli half a minut or so later hi awaken sens
appreci our presenc the incipi smile vanish and wa replac
by a somewhat terribl frown
meanwhil bicklei had pour out some of the hot coffe lace with
brandi into the cup that wa screw on the top of the thermo flask
advanc to the man whom i support he put it to hi lip he tast
and made a wry face but present he began to sip and ultim
swallow it all the effect of the stimul wa wonder for in
a few minut he came to life complet and wa even abl to sit up
without support
for quit a long while he gaze at us grave talk us in and
everyth connect with us for instanc bicklei medicinecas
which lai open show the littl vulcanit tube a few instrument and
other outfit engag hi particular attent and i saw at onc that
he understood what it wa thu hi arm still smart where the needl
had been driven in and on the blanket lai the syring he look at
hi arm then look at the syring and nod the paraffin hurrican
lamp also seem to interest and win hi approv we two men as
i thought attract him least of all he just sum us up and our
garment more especi the garment with a few shrewd glanc and
then seem to turn hi thought to tommi who had seat himself quit
contentedli at hi side evid accept him as a new addit to
our parti
i confess that thi behaviour on tommi part reassur me not a littl
i am a great believ in the instinct of anim especi of dog
and i felt certain that if thi man had not been in all essenti human
like ourselv tommi would not have toler him in the same wai the
sleeper clear like for tommi at whom he look much often and
with greater kind than he did at us suggest that there wa
good in him somewher sinc although a dog in it wonder
toler mai love a bad person in whom it smell out hidden virtu no
realli bad person ever love a dog or i mai add a child or a flower
as a matter of fact the old god as we had christen him while he
wa in hi coffin dure all our associ with him care infinit
more for tommi than he did for ani of us a circumst that ultim
wa not without it influenc upon our fortun but for thi there wa
a reason as we learn afterward also he wa not realli so amiabl as
i hope
when we had look at each other for a long while the sleeper began
to arrang hi beard of which the length seem to surpris him
especi as tommi wa seat on on end of it find thi out and
appar not wish to disturb tommi he gave up the occup and
after on or two attempt for hi tongu and lip still seem to be
stiff address us in some sonor and music languag unlik ani
that we had ever heard we shook our head then by an afterthought i
said good dai to him in the languag of the orofenan he puzzl
over the word as though it were more or less familiar to him and when
i repeat it gave it back to me with a differ inde but in a
wai which convinc us that he quit understood what i meant the
convers went no further at the moment becaus just then some memori
seem to strike him
he wa sit with hi back against the coffin of the glitter ladi
whom therefor he had not seen now he began to turn round and be
too weak to do so motion me to help him i obei while bicklei
guess hi purpos held up on of the hurrican lamp that he might
see better with a kind of fierc eager he survei her who lai
within the coffin and after he had done so utter a sigh as of
intens relief
next he point to the metal cup out of which he had drunk bicklei
fill it again from the thermo flask which i observ excit hi
keen interest for have touch the flask with hi hand and found
that it wa cool he appear to marvel that the fluid come from it
should be hot and steam present he smile as though he had got
the clue to the mysteri and swallow hi second drink of coffe and
spirit thi done he motion to us to lift the lid of the ladi
coffin point out a certain catch in the bolt which at first we
could not master for it will be rememb that on thi coffin these
were shot
in the end by pursu the same method that we had us in the
instanc of hi own we rais the coffin lid and onc more were driven
to retreat from the sepulchr for a while by the overpow odour like
to that of a whole greenhous full of tuberos that flow out of it
induc a kind of stupefact from which even tommi fled
when we return it wa to find the man kneel by the side of the
coffin for as yet he could not stand with hi glow ey fix upon
the face of her who slept therein and wave hi long arm abov her
hypnot busi wonder if it will work whisper bicklei then
he lift the syring and look inquiringli at the man who shook hi
head and went on with hi mesmer pass
i crept round him and took my stand by the sleeper head that i might
watch her face which wa well worth watch while bicklei with
hi medicin at hand remain near her feet i think engag in
disinfect the syring in some spirit or acid i believ he wa
about to make an attempt to us it when suddenli as though beneath the
influenc of the hypnot pass a chang appear on the glitter
ladi face hitherto beauti as it wa it had been a dead face
though on of a person who had suddenli been cut off while in full
health and vigour a few hour or at the most a dai or so befor now
it began to live again it wa as though the spirit were return from
afar and not without toil and tribul
express after express flit across the featur inde these
seem to chang so much from moment to moment that thei might have
belong to sever differ individu though each wa beauti
the fact of these remark chang with the suggest of multiform
person which thei convei impress both bicklei and myself veri
much inde then the breast heav tumultu it even appear to
struggl next the ey open thei were full of wonder even of fear
but oh what marvel ey i do not know how to describ them i
cannot even state their exact colour except that it wa dark someth
like the blue of sapphir of the deepest tint and yet not black
larg too and soft as a deer thei shut again as though the light
hurt them then onc more open and wander about appar without
see
at length thei found my face for i wa still bend over her and
rest there appear to take it in by degre more it seem to
touch and stir some human spring in the stillsleep heart at least
the fear pass from her featur and wa replac by a faint smile
such as a patient sometim give to on known and well love as the
effect of chloroform pass awai for a while she look at me with an
earnest search gaze then suddenli for the first time move her
arm lift them and threw them round my neck
the old man stare bend hi imperi brow into a littl frown
but did noth bicklei stare also through hi glass and snif
as though in disapprov while i remain quit still fight with
a wild impuls to kiss her on the lip as on would an awaken and
belov child i doubt if i could have done so howev for realli
i wa immov my heart seem to stop and all my muscl to be
paralys
i do not know for how long thi endur but i do know how it end
present in the intens silenc i heard bastin heavi voic and
look round saw hi big head project into the sepulchr
well i never he said you seem to have woke them up with a
vengeanc if you begin like that with the ladi there will be
complic befor you have done arbuthnot
talk of be brought back to earth with a rush i could have kill
bastin and bicklei turn on him like a tiger told him to be off
find wood and light a larg fire in front of the statu i think he wa
about to argu when the ancient gave him a glanc of hi fierc ey
which alarm him and he depart bewild to return present with
the wood
but the sound of hi voic had broken the spell the ladi let her arm
fall with a start and shut her ey again seem to faint bicklei
sprang forward with hi sal volatil and appli it to her nostril the
ancient not interf for he seem to recognis that he had to deal
with a man of skill and on who meant well by them
in the end we brought her round again and to omit detail bicklei gave
her not coffe and brandi but a mixtur he compound of hot water
preserv milk and meat essenc the effect of it on her wa wonder
sinc a few minut after swallow it she sat up in the coffin then
we lift her from that narrow bed in which she had slept forah how
long and perceiv that beneath her also were crystal box of
the radiant heatgiv substanc we sat her on the floor of the
sepulchr wrap her also in a blanket
now it wa that tommi after frisk round her as though in welcom of
an old friend calmli establish himself besid her and laid hi
black head upon her knee she note it and smile for the first time
a marvel sweet and gentl smile more she place her slender hand
upon the dog and stroke him feebli
bicklei tri to make her drink some more of hi mixtur but she
refus motion him to give it to tommi thi howev he would not
do becaus there wa but on cup present both of the sleeper began
to shiver which caus bicklei anxieti abus bastin beneath hi
breath for be so long with the fire he drew the blanket closer
about them
then an idea came to him and he examin the glow box in the
coffin thei were loos be mere set in prepar caviti in the
crystal wrap our handkerchief about hi hand he took them out
and place them around the waken patient a proceed of which the
ancient nod approv just then too bastin return with hi first
load of firewood and soon we had a merri blaze go just outsid the
sepulchr i saw that thei observ the light of thi fire by mean
of a match with much interest
now thei grew warm again as inde we did alsotoo warm then in my
turn i had an idea i knew that by now the sun would be beat hotli
against the rock of the mount and suggest to bicklei that if
possibl the best thing we could do would be to get them into it
lifegiv rai he agre if we could make them understand and thei
were abl to walk so i tri first i direct the ancient attent
to the mouth of the cave which at thi distanc show as a white circl
of light he look at it and then at me with grave inquiri i made
motion to suggest that he should proce there repeat the word
sun in the orofenan tongu he understood at onc though whether
he read my mind rather than what i said i am not sure appar the
glitter ladi understood also and seem to be most anxiou to go
onli she look rather pitifulli at her feet and shook her head thi
decid me
i do not know if i have mention anywher that i am a tall man and veri
muscular she wa tall also but as i judg not so veri heavi after
her long fast at ani rate i felt quit certain that i could carri her
for that distanc stoop down i lift her up sign to her to
put her arm round my neck which she did then call to bicklei and
bastin to bring along the ancient between them with some difficulti i
struggl out of the sepulchr and start down the cave she wa more
heavi than i thought and yet i could have wish the journei longer to
begin with she seem quit trust and happi in my arm where she lai
with her head against my shoulder smile a littl as a child might do
especi when i had to stop and throw her long hair round my neck like
a muffler to prevent it from trail in the dust
a bundl of lavend or a truss of newmown hai could not have been
more sweet to carri and there wa someth electr about the touch of
her which went through and through me veri soon it wa over and we
were out of the cave into the full glori of the tropic sun at first
that her ey might becom accustom to it light and her awaken bodi
to it heat i set her down where shadow fell from the overhang rock
in a canva deck chair that had been brought by marama with the other
thing throw the rug about her to protect her from such wind as
there wa she nestl gratefulli into the soft seat and shut her ey
for the motion had tire her i note howev that she drew in the
sweet air with long breath
then i turn to observ the arriv of the ancient who wa be born
between bicklei and bastin in what children know as a dandychair which
is form by two peopl cross their hand in a peculiar fashion it
sai much for the tremend digniti of hi presenc that even thu
with on arm round the neck of bicklei and the other round that of
bastin and hi long white beard fall almost to the ground he still
look most impos
unfortun howev just as thei were emerg from the cave
bastin alwai the most awkward of creatur manag to leav hold with
on hand so that hi passeng nearli came to the ground never shall i
forget the look that he gave him inde i think that from thi moment
he hate bastin bicklei he respect as a man of intellig and
learn although in comparison with hi own the latter wa infantil
and crude me he toler and even like but bastin he detest
the onli on of our parti for whom he felt anyth approach real
affect wa the spaniel tommi
we set him down fortun uninjur on some rug and also in the
shadow then after a littl while we move both of them into the sun
it wa quit curiou to see them expand there as bicklei said
what happen to them might well be compar to the develop of a
butterfli which ha just broken from the live grave of it chrysali
and crept into the full hot radianc of the light it crinkl wing
unfold their brilliant tint develop in an hour or two it is perfect
gloriou prepar for life and flight a new creatur
so it wa with thi pair from moment to moment thei gather strength
and vigour nearbi to them as it happen stood a larg basket of
the lusciou nativ fruit brought that morn by the orofenan and at
these the ladi look with long with bicklei permiss i offer
them to her and to the ancient first peel them with my finger thei
at of them greedili a full meal and would have gone on had not the
stern bicklei fear untoward consequ remov the basket again
the result were wonder for half an hour afterward thei seem to
be quit strong with my assist the glitter ladi as i still call
her for at that time i did not know her name rose from the chair and
lean on me totter a few step forward then she stood look at
the sky and all the love panorama of natur beneath and stretch
out her arm as though in worship oh how beauti she seem with the
sunlight shine on her heavenli face
now for the first time i heard her voic it wa soft and deep yet in
it wa a curiou belllik tone that seem to vibrat like the sound of
chime heard from far awai never have i listen to such anoth voic
she point to the sun whereof the light turn her radiant hair and
garment to a kind of golden glori and call it by some name that i
could not understand i shook my head whereon she gave it a differ
name taken i suppos from anoth languag again i shook my head and
she tri a third time to my delight thi word wa practic the same
that the orofenan us for sun
ye i said speak veri slowli so it is call by the peopl of
thi land
she understood for she answer in much the same languag
what then do you call it
sun in the english tongu i repli
sun english she repeat after me then ad how ar you name
wander
humphrei i answer
humferi she said as though she were learn the word and those
bastin and bicklei i repli
over these patronym she shook her head as yet thei were too much for
her
how ar you name sleeper i ask
yva she answer
a beauti name for on who is beauti i declar with enthusiasm
of cours alwai in the rich orofenan dialect which by now i could talk
well enough
she repeat the word onc or twice then of a sudden caught their
mean for she smile and even colour sai hastili with a wave of
her hand toward the ancient who stood at a distanc between bastin and
bicklei my father oro great man great king great god
at thi inform i start for it wa startl to learn that
here wa the origin oro who wa still worship by the orofenan
although of hi actual exist thei had known noth for uncount
time also i wa glad to learn that he wa her father and not her old
husband for to me that would have been horribl a desecr too deep
for word
how long did you sleep yva i ask point toward the sepulchr
in the cave
after a littl thought she understood and shook her head hopelessli
then by an afterthought she said
star tell oro tonight
so oro wa an astronom as well as a king and a god i had guess as
much from those plate in the coffin which seem to have star engrav
on them
at thi point our convers came to an end for the ancient himself
approach lean on the arm of bicklei who wa engag in an anim
argument with bastin
for heaven sake said bicklei keep your theologi to yourself at
present if you upset the old fellow and put him in a temper he mai
die
if a man tell me that he is a god it is my duti to tell him that he is
a liar repli bastin obstin
which you did bastin onli fortun he did not understand you but
for your own sake i advis you not to take liberti he is not on i
think with whom it is wise to trifl i think he seem thirsti go and
get some water from the rain pool not from the lake
bastin depart and present return with an aluminum jug full of pure
water and a glass bicklei pour some of it into a glass and hand it
to yva who bent her head in thank then she did a curiou thing have
first lift the glass with both hand to the sky and held it so for a
few second she turn and with an obeis pour a littl of it on
the ground befor her father feet
a libat thought i to myself and evid bastin agre with me
for i heard him mutter
i believ she is make a heathen offer
doubtless we were right for oro accept the homag by a littl motion
of the head after thi at a sign from him she drank the water then
the glass wa refil and hand to oro who also held it toward the
sky he howev made no libat but drank at onc two tumbler of it
in rapid success
by now the direct sunlight wa pass from the mouth of the cave and
though it wa hot enough both of them shiver a littl thei spoke
togeth in some languag of which we could not understand a word as
though thei were debat what their cours of action should be the
disput wa long and earnest had we known what wa pass which i
learn afterward it would have made us suffici anxiou for the
point at issu wa noth less than whether we should or should not be
forthwith destroyedan end it appear that oro wa quit capabl of
bring about if he so pleas yva howev had veri clear view of
her own on the matter and as i gather even dare to threaten that she
would protect us by the us of certain power at her command though
what these were i do not know
while the event hung doubt tommi who wa grow bore with these
long proceed pick up a bough still cover with flower which
after their pretti fashion the orofenan had place on the top of on
of the basket of food thi small bough he brought and laid at the feet
of oro no doubt in the hope that he would throw it for him to fetch a
game in which the dog delight for some reason oro saw an omen in
thi simpl canin perform or he mai have thought that the dog
wa make an offer to him for he put hi thin hand to hi brow and
thought a while then motion to bastin to pick up the bough and give
it to him
next he spoke to hi daughter as though assent to someth for i
saw her sigh in relief no wonder for he wa convei hi decis to
spare our live and admit us to their fellowship
after thi again thei talk but in quit a differ tone and manner
then the glitter ladi said to me in her slow and archaic orofenan
we go to rest you must not follow we come back perhap tonight
perhap next night we ar quit safe you ar quit safe under the
beard of oro spirit of oro watch you you understand
i said i understood whereon she answer
goodby o humferi
goodby o yva i repli bow
thereon thei turn and refus all assist from us vanish into
the dark of the cave lean upon each other and walk slowli
chapter xii two hundr and fifti thousand year
you seem to have made the best of your time old fellow said bicklei
in rather a sour voic
i never knew peopl begin to call each other by their christian name
so soon ad bastin look at me with a suspici ey
i know no other i said
perhap not but at ani rate you have anoth though you dont seem to
have told it to her anywai i am glad thei ar gone for i wa get
tire of be order by everybodi to carri about wood and water for
them also i am terribl hungri as i cant eat befor it is light thei
have taken most of the best fruit to which i wa look forward but
thank good thei do not seem to care for pork
so am i said bicklei who realli look exhaust get the food
there a good fellow well talk afterward
when we had eaten somewhat silent i ask bicklei what he made of
the busi also whither he thought the sleeper had gone
i think i can answer the last question interrupt bastin i expect
it is to a place well known to student of the bibl which even bicklei
mention sometim when he is angri at ani rate thei seem to be veri
fond of heat for thei wouldnt part from it even in their coffin and
you will admit that thei ar not quit natur although that glitter
ladi is so attract as regard her exterior
bicklei wave these remark asid and address himself to me
i dont know what to think of it he said but as the experi is
not natur and everyth in the univers so far as we know it ha a
natur explan i am inclin to the belief that we ar suffer
from hallucin which in their wai ar also quit natur it doe
not seem possibl that two peopl can realli have been asleep for an
unknown length of time enclos in vessel of glass or crystal kept
warm by radium or some such substanc and then emerg from them
compar strong and well it is contrari to natur law
how about microb i ask thei ar said to last practic for
ever and thei ar live thing so in their case your natur law
break down
that is true he answer some microb in a seal tube and under
certain condit do appear to possess indefinit power of life also
radium ha an indefinit life but that is a miner onli these peopl
ar not microb nor ar thei miner also experi tell us that
thei could not have live for more than a few month at the outsid in
such circumst as we seem to find them
then what do you suggest
i suggest that we did not realli find them at all that we have all
been dream you know that there ar certain gase which produc
illus laugh ga is on of them and that these gase ar
sometim met with in cave now there were veri peculiar odour in that
place under the statu which mai have work upon our imagin in
some such wai otherwis we ar up against a miracl and as you know
i do not believ in miracl
i do said bastin calmli youll find all about it in the bibl if
you will onli take the troubl to read why do you talk such rubbish
about gase
becaus onli ga or someth of the sort could have made us imagin
them
nonsens bicklei those peopl were here right enough didnt thei eat
our fruit and drink the water i brought them without ever sai thank
you onli thei ar not human thei ar evil spirit and for my part
i dont want to see ani more of them though i have no doubt arbuthnot
doe as that glitter ladi threw her arm round hi neck when she
woke up and alreadi he is call her by her christian name if the
word christian can be us in connect with her the old fellow had
the impud to tell us that he wa a god and it is remark that
he should have call himself oro see that the devil thei worship on
the island is also call oro and the place itself is name orofena
as to where thei have gone continu bicklei take no notic of
bastin i realli dont know my expect is howev that when
we go to look tomorrow morningand i suggest that we should not do so
befor then in order that we mai give our mind time to clearw shall
find that sepulchr place quit empti even perhap without the crystal
coffin we have imagin to stand there
perhap we shall find that there isnt a cave at all and that we ar
not sit on a flat rock outsid of it suggest bastin with heavi
sarcasm ad you ar clever in your wai bicklei but you can talk
more rubbish than ani man i ever knew
thei told us thei would come back tonight or tomorrow i said if
thei do what will you sai then bicklei
i will wait till thei come to answer that question now let us go for
a walk and try to chang our thought we ar all overstrain and
scarc know what we ar sai
on more question i said as we rose to start did tommi suffer from
hallucin as well as ourselv
why not answer bicklei he is an anim just as we ar or perhap
we thought we saw tommi do the thing he did
when you found that basket of fruit bastin which the nativ brought
over in the cano wa there a bough cover with red flower ly on
the top of it
ye arbuthnot on bough onli i threw it down on the rock as it got
in the wai when i wa carri the basket
which flower bough we all thought we saw the sleeper oro carri awai
after tommi had brought it to him
ye he made me pick it up and give it to him said bastin
well if we did not see thi it should still be ly on the rock as
there ha been no wind and there ar no anim here to carri it awai
you will admit that bicklei
he nod
then if it ha gone you will admit also that the presumpt is that we
saw what we thought we did see
i do not know how that conclus can be avoid at ani rate so far as
the incid of the bough is concern repli bicklei with caution
then without more word we start to look at the spot where the
bough should have been there wa no bough but on the rock lai sever
of the red flower bitten off i suppos by tommi while he wa
carri it nor wa thi all i think i have mention that the
glitter ladi wore sandal which were fasten with red stud that
look like rubi or carbuncl on the rock lai on of these stud
i pick it up and we examin it it had been sewn to the sandalstrap
with golden thread or silk some of thi substanc hung from the hole
drill in the stone which serv for an ey it wa as rotten as
tinder appar with extrem ag moreov the hard gem itself wa
pit as though the passag of time had taken effect upon it though
thi mai have been caus by other agenc such as the action of the
radium rai i smile at bicklei who look disconcert and even sad
in a wai it is pain to see the effect upon an abl and earnest man of
the upset of hi lifelong theori
we went for our walk keep to the flat land at the foot of the
volcano cone for we seem to have had enough of wonder and to desir
to reassur ourselv as it were by the studi of natur and
familiar thing as it chanc too we were reward by sundri us
discoveri thu we found a place where the breadtre and other
fruit most of them now ripe grew in abund as did the yam also
we came to an inlet that we notic wa crowd with larg and beauti
fish from the lake which seem to find it a favourit spot perhap
thi wa becaus a littl stream of excel water ran in here
overflow from the great pool or mere which fill the crater abov
at these find we rejoic greatli for now we knew that we need not
fear starvat even should our suppli of food from the main island be
cut off inde by help of some palmleaf stalk which we wove togeth
roughli bastin who wa rather clever at thi kind of thing manag
to trap four fish weigh two or three pound apiec wade into the
water to do so it wa curiou to observ with what eas he adapt
himself to the manner and custom of primev man so much so inde
that bicklei remark that if he could believ in reincarn he
would be absolut certain that bastin wa a troglodyt in hi last
sojourn on the earth
howev thi might be bastin primev instinct and abil were of
the utmost servic to us befor we had been mani dai on that island
he had built us a kind of nativ hut or hous roof with palm leav in
which until provid with a better as happen afterward we at and
he and bicklei slept leav the tent to me moreov he wove a net
of palm fibr with which he caught abund of fish and made
fishinglin of the same materi fortun we had some hook which
he bait with freshwat mussel and the insid of fish by mean of
these he secur some verit monster of the carp speci that prove
most excel eat hi greatest triumph howev wa a decoi which
he construct of bough wherein he trap a number of waterfowl so
that soon we kept a veri good tabl of a sort especi after he
had learn how to cook our food upon the nativ plan by mean of hot
stone thi suit us admir as it enabl bicklei and myself to
devot all our time to archaeolog and other studi which did not
greatli interest bastin
by the time that we got back to camp it wa draw toward even
so we cook our food and at and then thoroughli exhaust made
ourselv as comfort as we could and went to sleep even our
marvel experi could not keep bicklei and myself from sleep
and on bastin such thing had no effect he accept them and that wa
all much more readili than we did inde triplearm as he wa in
the mail of a childlik faith he snap hi finger at evil spirit
which he suppos the sleeper to be and at everyth els that other
men might dread
now as i have mention after our talk with marama although we did
not think it wise to adventur ourselv among them again at present we
had lost all fear of the orofenan in thi attitud so far as marama
himself and the major of hi peopl were concern we were quit
justifi for thei were our warm friend but in the case of the
sorcer the priest and all their rascal and superstiti
brotherhood we were by no mean justifi thei had not forgiven bastin
hi sacrileg or for hi undermin of their author by the preach
of new doctrin which if adopt would destroi them as a hierarchi
nor had thei forgiven bicklei for shoot on of their number or ani
of us for our escap from the vengeanc of their god
so it came about that thei made a plot to seiz us all and hale us off
to be sacrif to a substitut imag of oro which by now thei had
set up thei knew exactli where we slept upon the rock inde our fire
show it to them and so far thei were not afraid to ventur sinc here
thei had been accustom for gener to lai their offer to
the god of the mountain secretli on the previou night without the
knowledg of marama thei had carri two more cano to the border of
the lake now on thi night just as the moon wa set about three
in the morn thei made their attack twentyon men in all for the
three cano were larg reli on the follow dark to get us
awai and convei us to the place of sacrific to be offer up at dawn
and befor marama could interfer
the first we knew of the matter for most foolishli we had neglect to
keep a watch wa the unpleas sensat of brawni savag kneel on
us and truss us up with palmfibr rope also thei thrust hand
of dry grass into our mouth to prevent us from call out although as
air came through the interstic of the grass we did not suffoc the
thing wa so well done that we never struck a blow in selfdef and
although we had our pistol at hand much less could we fire a shot of
cours we struggl as well as we were abl but it wa quit useless
in three minut we were as helpless as calv in a net and like calv
were be convei to the butcher bastin manag to get the gag out
of hi mouth for a few second and i heard him sai in hi slow heavi
voic
thi bicklei is what come of traffick with evil spirit in museum
case there hi speech stop for the grass wad wa jam down hi
throat again but distinctli i heard the inarticul bicklei snort
as he conceiv the reparte he wa unabl to utter as for myself i
reflect that the busi serv us right for not keep a watch and
abandon the issu to fate
still to confess the truth i wa infinit more sorri to die than i
should have been fortyeight hour earlier thi is a dull and in most
wai a dread world on if we could onli summon the courag that
some of us would be glad to leav in search of new adventur but here
a great and unpreced adventur had begun to befal me and
befor it mysteri wa solv befor even i could formul a theori
concern it my bodi must be destroi and my intellig that wa
cage therein sent far afield or if bicklei were right eclips
it seem so sad just when the imposs like an unguess wander
moon had risen over the grei flat of the ascertain and made them
shine with hope and wonder
thei carri us off to the cano not too gentli inde i heard the
boni frame of bastin bump into the bottom of on of them and reflect
not without venom that it serv him right as he wa the fount and
origin of our woe two stink magician wear on their head
undress edit of their court cage sinc these were too cumbersom
for activ work of the sort and paint all over with variou pigment
were just about to swing me after him into the same or anoth cano
when someth happen i did not know what it wa but as a result my
captor left hold of me so that i fell to the rock ly upon my back
then within my line of vision which it must be rememb wa
limit becaus i could not lift my head appear the upper part of the
tall person of the ancient who said that he wa name oro i could onli
see him down to hi middl but i note vagu that he seem to be
much chang for instanc he wore a differ colour dress or
rather robe thi time it wa dark blue which caus me to wonder where
on earth it came from also hi tremend beard had been trim
and dress and on hi head there wa a simpl black cap strang
quilt which look as though it were made of velvet moreov
hi face had plump out he still look ancient it is true and
unutter wise but now he resembl an antiqu youth so great were
hi energi and vigour also hi dark and glow ey shone with a
fear intens in short he seem impress and terribl almost
beyond imagin
he look about him slowli then ask in a deep cold voic speak
in the orofenan tongu
what do you slave
no on seem abl to answer thei were too horrorstricken at thi
sudden vision of their fabl god whose fierc featur of wood had
becom flesh thei onli turn to fly he wave hi thin hand and thei
came to a standstil like anim which have reach the end of their
tether and ar check by the chain that bind them there thei stood
in all sort of postur immov and look extrem ridicul in
their paint and feather with dread unutter stamp upon their evil
face
the sleeper spoke again
you would murder as did your forefath o children of snake and hog
fashion in the shape of men you would sacrific those who dwell in my
shadow to satisfi your hate becaus thei ar wiser than you come hither
thou and he beckon with a boni finger to the chief magician
the man advanc toward him in short jump as a mechan toi might
do and stood befor him hi miniatur crate and feather all awri and
the sweat of terror melt the paint in streak upon hi face
look into the ey of oro o worshipp of oro said the sleeper and
he obei hi own ey start out of hi head
receiv the curs of oro said the ancient again then follow a
terribl spectacl the man went rave mad he bound into the air to
a height inconceiv he threw himself upon the ground and roll upon
the rock he rose again and stagger round and round tear piec
out of hi arm with hi teeth he yell hideous like on possess
he grovel beat hi forehead against the rock then he sat up
slowli choke anddi
hi companion seem to catch the infect of death as terrifi
savag often do thei too perform dread antic all except three
of them who stood paralys thei rush about batter each other with
their fist and wooden weapon look like devil from hell in
their hideou paint attir thei grappl and fought furious thei
separ and plung into the lake where with a last grimac thei sank
like stone
it seem to last a long while but i think that as a matter of fact
within five minut it wa over thei were all dead onli the three
paralys on remain stand and roll their ey
the sleeper beckon to them with hi thin finger and thei walk
forward in step like soldier
lift that man from the boat he said point to bastin cut hi
bond and those of the other
thei obei with a wonder alacr in a minut we stood at liberti
and were pull the grass gag from our mouth the ancient point
to the head magician who lai dead upon the rock hi hideou contort
counten stare openei at heaven
take that sorcer and show him to the other sorcer yonder he
said and tell them where your fellow ar if thei would find them
know by these sign that the oro god of the mountain who ha slept a
while is awak and ill will it go with them who question hi power or
dare to try to harm those who dwell in hi hous bring food dai by dai
and await command begon
the dreadfullook bodi wa bundl into on of the cano that
out of which bastin had emerg a rower sprang into each of them and
present wa paddl as he had never done befor as the set
moon vanish thei vanish with it and onc more there wa a great
silenc
i am go to find my boot said bastin thi rock is hard and i
hurt my feet kick at those poor fellow who appear to have come to a
bad end how i do not exactli understand person i think that more
allow should have been made for them as i hope will be the case
elsewher sinc after all thei onli act accord to their light
curs their light ejacul bicklei feel hi throat which wa
bruis im glad thei ar out
bastin limp awai in search of hi boot but bicklei and i stood where
we were contempl the awaken sleeper all recollect of the
recent tumultu scene seem to have pass from hi mind for he wa
engag in a studi of the heaven thei were wonderfulli brilliant now
that the moon wa down brilliant as thei onli can be in the tropic
when the sky is clear
someth caus me to look round and there come toward us wa she
who said her name wa yva evid all her weak had depart also
for now she need no support but walk with a peculiar glide motion
that remind me of a swan float forward on the water well had we
name her the glitter ladi for in the starlight liter she seem
to glitter i suppos the effect came from her golden raiment which
howev i notic as in her father case wa not the same that she
had worn in the coffin also from her hair that seem to give out a
light of it own at least she shimmer as she came her tall shape
swai at everi step like a willow in the wind she drew near and
i saw that her face too had fill out and now wa that of on in
perfect health and vigour while her ey shone softli and seem
wondrou larg
in her hand she carri those two plate of metal which i had seen
ly in the coffin of the sleeper oro these she gave to him then fell
back out of hi hearingif it were ever possibl to do thi a point
on which i am not sureand began to talk to me i note at onc that in
the few hour dure which she wa absent her knowledg of the orofenan
tongu seem to have improv greatli as though she had drunk deepli
from some hidden fount of memori now she spoke it with readi as
oro had done when he address the sorcer although mani of the word
she us were not known to me and the gener form of her languag
appear archaic as for instanc that of spenser is compar with
modern english when she saw i did not comprehend her howev she
would stop and cast her sentenc in a differ shape till at length i
caught her mean now i give the substanc of what she said
you ar safe she began glanc first at the palm rope that lai
upon the rock and then at my wrist on of which wa cut
ye ladi yva thank to your father
you should sai thank to me my father wa think of other thing
but i wa think of you stranger and from where i wa i saw those
wick on come to kill you
oh from the top of the mountain i suppos
she shook her head and smile but vouchsaf no further explan
unless her follow word can be so call these were
i can see otherwis than with my ey if i choos a statement that
caus bicklei who wa listen to mutter
imposs what the deuc can she mean telepathi perhap
i saw she continu and told the lord my father he came forth
did he kill them i did not look to learn
ye thei lie in the lake all except three whom he sent awai as
messeng
i thought so death is terribl o humphrei but it is a sword which
those who rule must us to smite the wick and the savag
not wish to pursu thi subject i ask her what her father wa
do with the metal plate
he read the star she answer to learn how long we have been
asleep befor we went to sleep he made two pictur of them as
thei were then and as thei should be at the time he had set for our
awaken
we set that time interrupt bicklei
not so o bicklei she answer smile again in the divin oro
head wa the time set you were the hand that execut hi decre
when bicklei heard thi i realli thought he would have burst howev
he control himself nobli be anxiou to hear the end of thi
mysteri fib
how long wa the time that the lord oro set apart for sleep i ask
she paus as though puzzl to find word to express her mean then
held up her hand and said
ten nod at her finger by second thought she took bicklei
hand not mine and count hi ten finger
ten year said bicklei well of cours it is imposs but
perhap and he paus
ten ten she went on with a deepen smile on hundr
o said bicklei
ten hundr on thousand
i sai said bicklei
ten time ten thousand on hundr thousand
bicklei becam silent
twice on hundr thousand and half a hundr thousand two hundr and
fifti thousand year that wa the space of time which the lord oro my
father set for our sleep whether it ha been fulfil he will know
present when he ha read the book of the star and made comparison of
it with what he wrote befor we laid us down to rest and she point
to the metal plate which the ancient wa studi
bicklei walk awai make sound as though he were go to be ill and
look so absurd in hi indign that i nearli laugh the ladi yva
actual did laugh and veri music wa that laugh
he doe not believ she said he is so clever he know everyth
but two hundr and fifti thousand year ago we should have thought him
quit stupid then we could read the star and calcul their movement
for ever
so can we i answer rather nettl
i am glad o humphrei sinc you will be abl to show my father if in
on of them he is wrong
secretli i hope that thi task would not be laid on me inde i
thought it well to chang the subject for the edif of bicklei who
had recov and wa drawn back by hi eager curios just then too
bastin join us happi in hi regain boot
you tell us ladi yva i said that you slept or should have slept
for two hundr and fifti thousand year here bastin open hi ey
if that wa so where wa your mind all thi time
if by my mind you mean spirit o humphrei i have to answer that at
present i do not know for certain i think howev that it dwelt
elsewher perhap in other bodi on the earth or some differ
earth at least i know that my heart is veri full of memori which as
yet i cannot unrol and read
great heaven thi is mad said bicklei
in the great heaven she answer slowli there ar mani thing
which you poor man would think to be mad but yet ar truth and
perfect wisdom these thing or some of them soon i shall hope to show
you
do if you can said bicklei
why not interrupt bastin i think the ladi remark quit
reason it seem to me highli improb if realli she ha slept for
two hundr and fifti thousand year which of cours i cant decid
that an immort spirit would be allow to remain idl for so long
that would be wallow in a bed of idl and shirk it duti which
is to do it work also as she tell you bicklei you ar not half
so clever as you think you ar in your silli sceptic and i have no
doubt that there ar mani thing in other world which would expos your
ignor if onli you could see them
at thi moment oro turn and call hi daughter she went at onc
sai
come stranger and you shall learn
so we follow her
daughter he said speak in orofenan i think that we might
understand ask these stranger to bring on of those lamp of their
that by the light of it i mai studi these write
perhap thi mai serv said bicklei suddenli produc an electr
torch from hi pocket and flash it into hi face it wa hi form of
reparte for all he had suffer at the hand of thi incomprehens
pair let me sai at onc that it wa singularli success perhap the
wisdom of the ag in which oro flourish had overlook so small a
matter as electr torch or perhap he did not expect to meet with
them in these degener dai at ani rate for the first and last time
in my intercours with him i saw the god or lordth nativ word bear
either meaningoro genuin astonish he start and step back
and for a moment or two seem a littl frighten then mutter
someth as to the clever of thi lightproduc instrument
he motion to hi daughter to take it from bicklei and hold it in a
certain posit she obei and in it illumin he began to studi
the engrav plate hold on of them in either hand
after a while he gave me on of the plate to hold and with hi
disengag hand point success to the constel of orion to
the star castor pollux aldebaran rigel the pleiad siriu and
other which with my veri limit knowledg i could not recognis
offhand then on the plate which i held he show us those same star
and constel check them on by on
then he remark veri quietli that all wa in order and hand the
plate he held to yva said
the calcul made so long ago ar correct nor have the star
vari in their proper motion dure what is after all but an hour of
time if you stranger who i understand ar name humphrei should
be as i gather a heavenmast natur you will ask me how i could
fix an exact date by the star without an error of let us sai from
five to ten thousand year i answer you that by the proper motion of
the star alon it would have been difficult therefor i rememb that
in order to be exact i calcul the futur conjunct of those two
planet and he point to saturn and jupit find that on of
these occur near yonder star and he indic the bright orb
spica at a certain time i determin that then i would awak behold
there ar the star as i engrav them from my foreknowledg upon thi
chart and there those two great planet hang in conjunct daughter
yva my wisdom ha not fail me thi world of our ha travel round
the sun neither less nor more than two hundr and fifti thousand time
sinc we laid ourselv down to sleep it is written here and yonder
and he point first to the engrav plate and then to the vast
expans of the starlit heaven
aw fell on me i think that even bicklei and bastin were aw at ani
rate for the moment it wa a terribl thing to look on a be to all
appear more or less human who alleg that he had been asleep
for two hundr and fifti thousand year and proceed to prove it by
certain ancient star chart of cours at the time i could not check
those chart lack the necessari knowledg but i have done so sinc
and found that thei ar quit accur howev thi made no differ
sinc the circumst and someth in hi manner convinc me that he
spoke the absolut truth
he and hi daughter had been asleep for two hundr and fifti thousand
year oh heaven for two hundr and fifti thousand year
chapter xiii oro speak and bastin argu
the reader of what i have written should there ever be such a person
mai find the record marvel and therefor rashli conclud that
becaus it is beyond experi it could not be it is not a wise
deduct as i think bicklei would admit todai becaus without doubt
mani thing ar which surpass our extrem limit experi howev
those who draw the veil from the unknown and reveal the new must expect
incredul and accept it without grumbl wa that not the fate
for instanc of those who in the middl ag a few hundr year
ago discov or rather rediscov the mighti movement of those
constel which serv oro for an almanac
but the point i want to make is that if the sceptic plai a bickleyan
part as regard what ha been written it seem probabl that hi
attitud will be accentu as regard that which it still remain for
me to write if so i cannot help it and must declin entir to water
down or doctor fact and thu pander to hi prejudic and ignor for
my part i cannot attempt to explain these occurr i onli know that
thei happen and that i set down what i saw heard and felt neither
more nor less
immedi after oro had triumphantli vindic hi stellar
calcul he turn and depart into the cave follow by hi
daughter wave to us to remain where we were as she pass us
howev the glitter ladi whisperedthi time to bastinthat he
would see them again in a few hour ad
we have much to learn and i hope that then you who i understand ar a
priest will begin to teach us of your religion and other matter
bastin wa so astonish that he could make no repli but when thei had
gone he said
which of you told her that i wa a priest
we shook our head for neither of us could rememb have done so
well i did not continu bastin sinc at present i have found
no opportun of sai a word in season so i suppos she must have
gather it from my attir though as a matter of fact i havent been
wear a collar and those men who want to cook me pull off my
white tie and i didnt think it worth while dirti a clean on
if said bicklei you imagin that you look like the minist of
ani religion ancient or modern in a grubbi flannel shirt a batter
sunhelmet a torn green and white umbrella and a pair of rag duck
trouser you ar mistaken bastin that is all
i admit that the costum is not appropri bicklei but how otherwis
could she have learn the truth
these peopl seem to have wai of learn a good mani thing but
in your case bastin the caus is clear enough you have been walk
about with the head of that idol and alwai keep it close to you no
doubt thei believ that you ar a priest of the worship of the god of
the groveba you know or someth of that sort
when he heard thi bastin face becam a perfect pictur never befor
did i see it so full of horror struggl with indign
i must undec them without a moment delai he said and wa
start for the cave when we caught hi arm and held him
better wait till thei come back old fellow i said laugh if
you disobei that lord oro you mai meet with anoth experi in the
sacrific line
perhap you ar right arbuthnot i will occupi the interv in
prepar a suitabl address
much better occupi it in prepar breakfast said bicklei i have
alwai notic that you ar at your best extempor
in the end he did prepar breakfast though in a distrait fashion inde
i found him begin to make tea in the fryingpan bastin felt
that hi opportun had arriv and wa make readi to rise to the
occas
also we felt all three of us that we were extrem shabbylook
object and though none of us said so each did hi best to improv
hi person appear first of all bicklei cut bastin and my hair
after which i did him the same servic then bicklei who wa normal
clean shaven set to work to remov a beard of about a week growth
and i who wore on of the point varieti trim up mine as best i
could with the help of a handglass bastin too perform on hi which
wa of the squar and rather rag type wise reject bicklei
advic to shave it off altogeth offer i felt convinc becaus
he felt that the result on bastin would be too hideou for word after
thi we cut our nail clean our teeth and bath i even caught
bicklei appli hair tonic from hi dress case in secret behind a
project rock and borrow some myself he gave it me on condit
that i did not mention it exist to bastin who he remark would
certainli us the lot and make himself smell horribl
next we found clean duck among our store of spare cloth for the
orofenan had brought these with our other possess and put them on
even ad silk cumberbund and neckti my tie i fasten with a pin
that i had obtain in egypt it wa a tini gold statuett of veri fine
and earli workmanship of the god osiri wear the crown of the upper
land with the uraeu crest and hold in hi hand which project
from the mummi wrap the emblem of the crook the scourg and the
crux ansata or sign of life
bastin for hi part arrai himself in full cleric costum black
coat and trouser white tie and stickup clergyman collar which
as he remark made him feel extrem hot in that climat and were
unsuit to domest duti such as washingup i offer to hold hi
coat while he did thi offic and told him he look veri nice inde
beauti remark bicklei but why dont you put on your surplic
and biretta be veri highchurch bastin did wear a biretta on
festiv sundai at home there would be no mistak about you then
i do not think it would be suitabl repli bastin whose sens of
humour wa undevelop there is no servic to be perform at present
and no church though perhap that cave and he stop
when we had finish these vain adorn and bastin had put awai the
thing and tidi up we sat down rather at a loos end we should have
like to walk but refrain from do so for fear lest we might dirti
our clean cloth so we just sat and thought at least bicklei thought
and so did i for a while until i gave it up what wa the us of
think see that we were face to face with circumst which
baffl reason and beggar all record human experi what bastin
did i am sure i do not know but i think from the express of hi
counten that he wa engag in compos sermon for the benefit of
oro and the glitter ladi
on divers we did have about eleven oclock a cano came from the
main island laden with provis and paddl by marama and two of hi
peopl we seiz our weapon rememb our experi of the night
but marama wave a bough in token of peac so carri our revolv
we went to the rock edg to meet him he crept ashor and chief though
he wa prostrat himself upon hi face befor us which told me that
he had heard of the fate of the sorcer hi apolog were abject he
explain that he had no part in the outrag of the attack and besought
us to interced on behalf of him and hi peopl with the awaken god of
the mountain whom he look for with a terrifi air
we consol him as well as we could and told him that he had best be
gone befor the god of the mountain appear and perhap treat him as
he had done the sorcer in hi name howev we command marama to
bring materi and build us a proper hous upon the rock also to be
sure to keep up a regular and ampl suppli of provis if he did
these thing and anyth els we might from time to time command
we said that perhap hi life and those of hi peopl would be spare
thi howev after the evil behaviour of some of them of cours we
could not guarante
marama depart so thoroughli frighten that he even forgot to make ani
inquiri as to who thi god of the mountain might be or where he came
from or whither he wa go of cours the place had been sacr
among hi peopl from the begin whenev that mai have been but
that it sacred should materialis into an activ god who brought
sorcer of the highest reput to a most unpleas end just
becaus thei wish to translat their preach into practic wa
anoth matter it wa not to be explain even by the fact of which he
himself had inform me that dure the dread storm of some month
befor the cave mouth which previous wa not visibl on the volcano
had suddenli been lift up abov the level of the rock of offer
although of cours all religi and instruct person would have
expect someth peculiar to happen after thi event
such i knew were hi thought but as i have said he wa too
frighten and too hurri to express them in question that i should
have found it extrem difficult to answer as it wa he depart
quit uncertain as to whether on of us wa not the real god of the
mountain who had power to bring hideou death upon hi molest
after all what had he to go on to the contrari except the word of
three priest who were so terrifi that thei could give no coher
account of what had happen of these event it wa true there wa
evid in the twist carcass of their lament high sorcer and
for the matter of that of certain corps which he had seen that lai
in shallow water at the bottom of the lake beyond all wa vagu and in
hi heart i am sure that marama believ that bastin wa the real god
of the mountain natur he would desir to work vengeanc on those
who tri to sacrific and eat him moreov had he not destroi the
imag of the god of the grove and born awai it head whenc he had
suck magic and power
thu argu marama disbeliev the tale of the frighten sorcer
for he admit as much to me in after dai
marama depart in a great hurri fear lest the god of the
mountain or bastin whose new and splendid garb he regard with much
suspicion might develop some evil energi against him then we went back
to our camp leav the industri bastin anim by a suggest
from bicklei that the fruit and food might spoil if left in the sun
to carri it into the shade of the cave ow to the terror of the
orofenan the suppli wa so larg that to do thi he must make no fewer
than seven journei which he did with great good will sinc bastin
love physic exercis the result on hi cleric garment howev
wa disastr hi white tie went awri squash fruit and roast pig
gravi ran down hi waistcoat and trouser and hi high collar melt
into limp crinkl in the moistur engend by the tropic heat onli
hi long coat escap sinc that bicklei kindli carri for him
it wa just as he arriv with the seventh load in thi extrem
dishevel condit that oro and hi daughter emerg from the cave
inde bastin who be shortsight alwai wore spectacl that
ow to hi heat state were cover with mist not see that
dignitari dump down the last basket on to hi toe exclaim
there you lazi beggar i told you i would bring it all and i have
in fact he thought he wa address bicklei and plai off on him a
troglodyt practic joke
oro howev who at hi ag did not appreci joke resent it and
wa about to do someth unpleas when with extraordinari tact hi
daughter remark
bastin the priest make you offer thank him o lord my father
so oro thank him not too cordial for evid he still had feel
in hi toe and onc more bastin escap becom awar of hi error
he began to apologis profus in english while the ladi yva studi
him carefulli
is that the costum of the priest of your religion o bastin she
ask survei hi dishevel form if so you were better without
it
then bastin retir to straighten hi tie and grab hi coat
from bicklei who hand it to him with a malici smile forc hi
perspir arm into it in a peculiarli awkward and elephantin fashion
meanwhil bicklei and i produc two camp chair which we had made
readi and on these the wondrou pair seat themselv side by side
we have come to learn said oro teach
not so father interrupt yva who i note wa cloth in yet a
third costum though whenc these came i could not imagin first i
would ask a question whenc ar you stranger and how came you here
we ar from the countri call england and a great storm shipwreck us
here that i think which rais the mouth of the cave abov the level
of thi rock i answer
the time appoint have come when it should be rais said oro as
though to himself
where is england ask yva
now among the book we had with us wa a pocket atla quit a good on
of it sort by wai of answer i open it at the map of the world and
show her england also i show to within a thousand mile or so
that spot on the earth surfac where we spoke togeth
the sight of thi atla excit the pair greatli thei had not the
slightest difficulti in understand everyth about it and the shape
of the world with it divis into hemispher seem to be quit
familiar to them what appear chiefli to interest them and especi
oro were the rel area and posit of land and sea
of thi stranger he said point to the map i shall have much
to sai to you when i have studi the pictur of your book and compar
them with other of my own
so he ha got map said bicklei in english as well as star chart
i wonder where he keep them
with hi cloth i expect suggest bastin
meanwhil oro had hidden the atla in hi ampl robe and motion to hi
daughter to proce
why do you come here from england so far awai the ladi yva ask a
question to which each of us had an answer
to see new countri i said
becaus the cyclon brought us said bicklei
to convert the heathen to my own christian religion said bastin
which wa not strictli true
it wa on thi last repli that she fix
what doe your religion teach she ask
it teach that those who accept it and obei it command will live
again after death for ever in a better world where is neither sorrow nor
sin he answer
when he heard thi sai i saw oro start as though struck by a new
thought and look at bastin with a curiou intent
who ar the heathen yva ask again after a paus for she also
seem to be impress
all who do not agre with bastin spiritu view answer bicklei
those who whether from lack of instruct or from hard of heart
do not follow the true faith for instanc i suppos that your father
and you ar heathen repli bastin stoutli
thi seem to astonish them but present yva caught hi mean and
smile while oro said
of thi great matter of faith we will talk later it is an old question
in the world
why went on yva if you wish to travel so far did you come in a
ship that so easili is wreck why did you not journei through the air
or better still pass through space leav your bodi asleep as
be instruct doubtless you can do
as regard your first question i answer there ar no aircraft
known that can make so long a journei
and as regard the second broke in bicklei we did not do so becaus
it is imposs for men to transfer themselv to other place through
space either with or without their bodi
at thi inform the glitter ladi lift her arch eyebrow and
smile a littl while oro said
i perceiv that the new world ha advanc but a littl wai on the road
of knowledg
fear that bastin wa about to commenc an argument i began to ask
question in my turn
lord oro and ladi yva i said we have told you someth of
ourselv and will tell you more when you desir it but pardon us if
first we prai you to tell us what we burn to know who ar you of what
race and countri and how came it that we found you sleep yonder
if it be your pleasur answer my father said yva
oro thought a moment then repli in a calm voic
i am a king who onc rule most of the world as it wa in my dai
though it is true that much of it rebel against me my councillor
and servant therefor i destroi the world as it wa then save onli
certain portion whenc life might spread to the new countri that i
rais up have done thi i put myself and my daughter to sleep for a
space of two hundr and fifti thousand year that there might be time
for fresh civilis to aris now i begin to think that i did not
allot a suffici of ag sinc i perceiv from what you tell me
that the learn of the new race is as yet but small
bicklei and i look at each other and were silent mental we had
collaps who could begin to discuss statement built upon such a
foundat of gigant and paralys falsehood
well bastin could for on with no more surpris in hi voic than if
he were talk about last night dinner he said
there must be a mistak somewher or perhap i misunderstand you it
is obviou that you be a man could not have destroi the world
that could onli be done by the power which made it and you
i trembl for the result of bastin method of set out the truth
to my astonish howev oro repli
you speak wise priest but the power you name mai us instrument to
accomplish it decre i am such an instrument
quit so said bastin just like anybodi els you have more
knowledg of the truth than i thought but prai how did you destroi the
world
us my wisdom to direct the forc that ar at work in the heart of
thi great globe i drown it with a delug caus on part to sink
and anoth to rise also chang of climat which complet the work
that quit right exclaim bastin delightedli we know all about
the delug onli you ar not mention in connect with the matter a
man noah had to do with it when he wa six hundr year old
six hundr said oro that is not veri old i myself had seen more
than a thousand year when i lai down to sleep
a thousand remark bastin mildli interest that is unusu
though some of these mighti men of renown we know live over nine
hundr
here bicklei snort and exclaim
nine hundr moon he mean
i did not know noah went on oro perhap he live after my time and
caus some other local delug is there anyth els you wish to ask
me befor i leav you that i mai studi thi map write
ye said bastin why were you allow to drown your world
becaus it wa evil priest and disobei me and the power i serv
oh thank you said bastin that fit in exactli it wa just the
same in noah time
i prai that it is not just the same now said oro rise tomorrow
we will return or if i do not who have much that i must do the ladi my
daughter will return and speak with you further
he depart into the cave yva follow at a littl distanc
i accompani her as far as the mouth of the cave as did tommi who
all thi time had been sit contentedli upon the hem of her gorgeou
robe quit careless of it immemori ag if it wa immemori and not
woven yesterdai a point on which i had no inform
ladi yva i said did i rightli understand the lord oro to sai that
he wa a thousand year old
ye o humphrei and realli he is more or so i think
then ar you a thousand year old also i ask aghast
no no she repli shake her head i am young quit young for i
do not count my time of sleep
certainli you look it i said but what ladi yva do you mean by
young
she answer my question by anoth
what ag ar your women when thei ar as i am
none of our women were ever quit like you ladi yva yet sai from
twentyf to thirti year of ag
ah i have been count and now i rememb when my father sent me to
sleep i wa twentyseven year old no i will not deceiv you i wa
twentyseven year and three moon then sai someth to the
effect that she would return she depart laugh a littl in a
mischiev wai and although i did not observ thi till afterward
tommi depart with her
when i repeat what she had said to bastin and bicklei who were
stand at a distanc strain their ear and somewhat aggriev the
former remark
if she is twentyseven her father must have marri late in life
though of cours it mai have been a long while befor he had children
then bicklei who had been suppress himself all thi while went off
like a bomb
do you tell us bastin he ask that you believ on word of
all thi ghastli rubbish i mean as to that antiqu charlatan be a
thousand year old and have caus the flood and the rest
if you ask me bicklei i see no particular reason to doubt it at
present a person who can go to sleep in a glass coffin kept warm by
a pocket of radium togeth with veri accur map of the
constel at the time he wake up can i imagin do most thing
even caus the delug jeer bicklei
i dont know about the delug but perhap he mai have been permit
to caus a delug why not you cant look at thing from far enough
off bicklei and if someth seem big to you you conclud that
therefor it is imposs the same power which give you skill to
succe in an oper that hitherto wa held impractic as i know
you have done onc or twice mai have given that old fellow power to
caus a delug you should measur the univers and it possibl by
world and not by acr bicklei
and believ i suppos that a man can live a thousand year wherea
we know well that he cannot live more than about a hundr
you dont know anyth of the sort bicklei all you know is that
over the brief period of histori with which we ar acquaint sai ten
thousand year at most men have onli live to about a hundr but the
veri rock which you ar so fond of talk about tell us that even
thi planet is million upon million of year of ag who know then
but that at some time in it histori men did not live for a thousand
year and that lost civilis did not exist of which thi oro and
hi daughter mai be two survivor
there is no proof of anyth of the sort said bicklei
i dont know about proof as you understand it though i have read in
plato of a contin call atlanti that wa submerg accord to
the stori of old egyptian priest but person i have everi proof
for it is all written down in the bibl at which you turn tip your nose
and i am veri glad that i have been lucki enough to come across thi
unexpect confirm of the stori not that it matter much sinc i
should have learn all about it when it pleas provid to remov me
to a better world which in our circumst mai happen ani dai now i
must chang my cloth befor i see to the cook and other thing
i am bound to admit said bicklei look after him that old bastin
is not so stupid as he seem from hi point of view the argument he
advanc ar quit logic moreov i think he is right when he sai
that we look at thing through the wrong end of the telescop after all
the univers is veri big and who know what mai happen there who know
even what mai have happen on thi littl earth dure the aeon of it
exist whenev it balanc chanc to shift as the ic ag show
us it ha often done still i believ that old oro to be a princ of
liar
that remain to be prove i answer cautious all i know is that
he is a wonderfulli learn person of most remark appear and
that hi daughter is the loveliest creatur i ever saw
there i agre said bicklei decidedli and as brilliant as she is
love if she belong to a past civilis it is a piti that it ever
becam extinct now let go and have a nap bastin will call us when
supper is readi
chapter xiv the underworld
that night we slept well and without fear be quit certain that
after their previou experi the orofenan would make no further
attempt upon us inde our onli anxieti wa for tommi whom we could
not find when the time came to give him hi supper bastin howev
seem to rememb have seen him follow the glitter ladi into
the cave thi of cours wa possibl as certainli he had taken an
enorm fanci to her and sat himself down as close to her as he could
on everi occas he even seem to like the ancient oro and wa not
afraid to jump up and plant hi dirti paw upon that terrif person
gorgeou robe moreov oro like him for sever time i observ him
pat the dog upon the head as i think i have said the onli human touch
that i had perceiv about him so we gave up search and call in
the hope that he wa safe with our supernatur friend
the next morn quit earli the ladi yva appear alon no not alon
for with her came our lost tommi look extrem spry and well at
eas the faithless littl wretch just greet us in a casual fashion
and then went and sat by yva in fact when the awkward bastin manag
to stumbl over the end of her dress tommi growl at him and show hi
teeth moreov the dog wa chang he wa bless with a shini black
coat but now thi coat sparkl in the sunlight like the ladi yva
hair
the glitter ladi is all veri well but im not sure that i care
for a glitter dog it doesnt look quit natur said bastin
contempl him
why doe tommi shine ladi i ask
becaus i wash him in certain water that we have so that now he
look beauti and smell sweet she answer laugh
it wa true the dog did smell sweet which i mai add had not alwai
been the case with him especi when there were dead fish about also
he appear to have been fed for he turn up hi nose at the bit we
had save for hi breakfast
he ha drunk of the lifewat explain yva and will want no food
for two dai
bicklei prick up hi ear at thi statement and look incredul
you do not believ o bicklei she said studi him grave
inde you believ noth you think my father and i tell you mani
li bastin there he believ all humphrei he is not sure he think
to himself i will wait and find out whether or no these funni peopl
cheat me
bicklei colour and made some remark about thing which were contrari
to experi also that tommi in a gener wai wa rather a greedi
littl dog
you too like to eat bicklei thi wa true he had an excel
appetit but when you have drunk the lifewat you will care much
less
i am glad to hear it interrupt bastin for bicklei want a lot of
cook done and i find it tediou
you eat also ladi said bicklei
ye i eat sometim becaus i like it but i can go week and not
eat when i have the lifewat just now after so long a sleep i am
hungri pleas give me some of that fruit no not the flesh flesh i
hate
we hand it to her she took two plantain peel and at them with
extraordinari grace inde she remind me i do not know why of some
love butterfli draw it food from a flower
while she at she observ us close noth seem to escap the
quick glanc of those beauti ey present she said
what o humphrei is that with which you fasten your neckdress and
she point to the littl gold statu of osiri that i us as a pin
i told her that it wa a statuett of a god name osiri and veri veri
ancient probabl quit five thousand year old a statement at which
she smile a littl also that it came from egypt
ah she answer is it so i ask becaus we have figur that
ar veri like to that on and thei also hold in their hand a staff
surmount by a loop thei ar figur of sleep brotherdeath
so is thi i said among the egyptian osiri wa the god of death
she nod and repli that doubtless the symbol had come down to them
on dai you shall take me to see thi land which you call so veri old
or i will take you which would be quicker she ad
we all bow and said we should be delight even bastin appear
anxiou to revisit egypt in such compani though when he wa there
it seem to bore him but what she meant about take us i could not
guess nor had we time to ask her for she went on watch our face
as she spoke
the lord oro send you a messag stranger he ask whether it is your
wish to see where we dwell he add that you ar not to come if you do
not desir or if you fear danger
we all answer that there wa noth we should like better but bastin
ad that he had alreadi seen the tomb
do you think bastin that we live in a tomb becaus we slept there for
a while await the advent of you wander at the appoint hour
i dont see where els it could be unless it is further down that
cave said bastin the top of the mountain would not be conveni as
a resid
it ha not been conveni for mani an ag for reason that i will
show you think now befor you come you have naught to fear from us
and i believ that no harm will happen to you but you will see mani
strang thing that will anger bicklei becaus he cannot understand
them and perhap will weari bastin becaus hi heart turn from what
is wondrou and ancient onli humphrei will rejoic in them becaus
the door of hi soul ar open and he longswhat do you long for
humphrei
that which i have lost and fear i shall never find again i answer
boldli
i know that you have lost mani thingslast night for instanc
you lost tommi and when he slept with me he told me much about you
andoth
thi is ridicul broke in bastin can a dog talk
everyth can talk if you understand it languag bastin but keep a
good heart humphrei for the bold seeker find in the end oh foolish
man do you not understand that all is your if you have but the soul to
conceiv and the will to grasp all all below between abov even i
know that i who have so much to learn
so she spoke and becam suddenli magnific her face which had been
but that of a superlov woman took on grandeur her bosom swell
her presenc radiat some subtl power much as her hair radiat
light
in a moment it wa gone and she wa smile and jest
will you come stranger where tommi wa not afraid to go down to
the underworld or will you stai here in the sun perhap you will do
better to stai here in the sun for the underworld ha terror for weak
heart that were born but yesterdai and feebl feet mai stumbl in the
dark
i shall take my electr torch said bastin with decis and i
advis you fellow to do the same i alwai hate cellar and the
catacomb at rome ar wors though full of sacr interest
then we start tommi frisk on ahead in a most provok wai as
though he were bore by a visit to a strang hous and go home and
yva glide forward with a smile upon her face that wa half mystic and
half mischiev we pass the remain of the machin and bicklei
ask her what thei were
carriag in which onc we travel through the ski until we found
a better wai and that the uninstruct us till the end she answer
carelessli leav me wonder what on earth she meant
we came to the statu and the sepulchr beneath without troubl for the
glint of her hair and i mai add of tommi back were quit suffici
to guid us through the gloom the crystal coffin were still there for
bastin flash hi torch and we saw them but the box of radium had
gone
let that light die she said to bastin humphrei give me your right
hand and give your left to bicklei let bastin cling to him and fear
noth
we pass to the end of the tomb and stood against what appear to be a
rock wall all close togeth as she direct
fear noth she said again but next second i wa never more full
of fear in my life for we were whirl downward at a speed that would
have made an american elev attend turn pale
dont choke me i heard bicklei sai to bastin and the latter
murmur repli of
i never could bear these move staircas and tubelift thei alwai
make me feel sick
i admit that for my part i also felt rather sick and clung tightli to
the hand of the glitter ladi she howev place her other hand
upon my shoulder sai in a low voic
did i not tell you to have no fear
then i felt comfort for somehow i knew that it wa not her desir
to harm and much less to destroi me also tommi wa seat quit at hi
eas with hi head rest against my leg and hi absenc of alarm wa
reassur the onli stoic of the parti wa bicklei i have no doubt
that he wa quit as frighten as we were but rather than show it he
would have di
i presum thi machineri is pneumat he began when suddenli and
without shock we arriv at the end of our journei how far we had
fallen i am sure i do not know but i should judg from the aw speed
at which we travel that it must have been sever thousand feet
probabl four or five
everyth seem steadi now remark bastin so i suppos thi
luggag lift ha stop the odd thing is that i cant see anyth
of it there ought to be a shaft but we seem to be stand on a level
floor
the odd thing is said bicklei that we can see at all where the
devil doe the light come from thousand of feet underground
i dont know answer bastin unless there is natur ga here as i
am told there is at a town call medicin hat in canada
natur ga be blow said bicklei it is more like moonlight
magnifi ten time
so it wa the whole place wa fill with a soft radianc equal to
that of the sun at noon but gentler and without heat
where doe it come from i whisper to yva
oh she repli as i thought evas it is the light of the
underworld which we know how to us the earth is full of light which
is not wonder is it see that it heart is fire now look about
you
i look and leant on her harder than ever sinc amaz made me
weak we were in some vast place whereof the roof seem almost as far
off as the sky at night at least all that i could make out wa a dim
and distant arch which might have been on of cloud for the rest in
everi direct stretch vast illumin far as the ey could
reach by the soft light of which i have spoken that is probabl for
sever mile but thi vast wa not empti on the contrari it wa
occupi by a great citi there were street much wider than piccadilli
all border by hous though these i observ were roofless veri
fine hous some of them built of white stone or marbl there were
roadwai and pavement worn by the passag of feet there farther on
were marketplac or public squar and there lastli wa a huge
central enclosur on or two hundr acr in extent which wa fill
with majest build that look like palac or townhal and in
the midst of them all a vast templ with court and a central dome for
here notwithstand the lack of necess it builder seem to have
adher to the overworld tradit and had roof their fane
and now came the terror all of thi enorm citi wa dead had it
stood upon the moon it could not have been more dead none pace it
street none look from it windowplac none traffick in it
market none worship in it templ swept garnish light
practic untouch by the hand of time here where no rain fell and
no wind blew it wa yet a howl wilder for what wilder is
there to equal that which onc ha been the busi haunt of men let
those who have stood among the buri citi of central asia or of
anarajapura in ceylon or even amid the ruin of salami on the coast
of cypru answer the question but here wa someth infinit more
aw a huge human haunt in the bowel of the earth utterli devoid of
human be and yet as perfect as on the dai when these ceas to be
i do not care for underground local remark bastin hi gruff
voic echo strang in that terribl silenc but it doe seem a
piti that all these fine build should be wast i suppos their
inhabit left them in search of fresh air
why did thei leav them i ask of yva
becaus death took them she answer solemnli even those who live a
thousand year die at last and if thei have no children with them di
the race
then were you the last of your peopl i ask
inquir of my father she repli and led the wai through the massiv
arch of a great build
it led into a wall courtyard in the centr of which wa a plain cupola
of marbl with a gate of some pale metal that look like platinum mix
with gold thi gate stood open within it wa the statu of a woman
beautifulli execut in white marbl and set in a nich of some black
stone the figur wa drape as though to conceal the shape and the
face wa stern and majest rather than beauti the ey of the
statu were cunningli made of some enamel which gave them a strang and
lifelik appear thei stare upward as though look awai from the
earth and it concern the arm were outstretch in the right hand
wa a cup of black marbl in the left a similar cup of white marbl
from each of these cup trickl a thin stream of sparkl water which
two stream met and mingl at a distanc of about three feet beneath
the cup then thei fell into a metal basin which although it must have
been quit a foot thick wa cut right through by their constant impact
and appar vanish down some pipe beneath out of thi metal basin
tommi who gambol into the place ahead of us began to drink in a
greedi and demonstr fashion
the lifewat i said look at our guid
she nod and ask in her turn
what is the statu and what doe it signifi humphrei
i hesit but bastin answer
just a rather ugli woman who hid up her figur becaus it wa bad
probabl she wa a relat of the artist who wish to have her
like done and sat for noth
the goddess of health suggest bicklei her proport ar
perfect a robust a thoroughli normal woman
now humphrei said yva
i stare at the work and had not an idea then it flash on me with
such sudden and certainti that i am convinc the answer to the
riddl wa pass to me from her and did not origin in my own mind
it seem quit easi i said in a superior tone the figur symbolis
life and is drape becaus we onli see the face of life the rest is
hidden the arm ar bare becaus life is real and activ on cup is
black and on is white becaus life bring both good and evil gift
that is why the stream mingl to be lost beneath in the dark of
death the featur ar stern and even terrifi rather than love
becaus such is the aspect of life the ey look upward and far awai
from present thing becaus the real life is not here
of cours on mai sai anyth said bastin but i dont understand
all that
imagin goe a long wai broke in bicklei who wa vex that he
had not thought of thi interpret himself but yva said
i begin to think that you ar quit clever humphrei i wonder whenc
the truth came to you for such is the mean of the figur and the
cup had i told it to you myself it could not have been better said
and she glanc at me out of the corner of her ey now stranger
will you drink onc that gate wa guard and onli at a great price or
as a great reward were certain of the highest blood given the freedom of
thi fountain which might touch no common lip inde it wa on of the
caus of our last war for all the world which wa desir thi water
which now is lap by a stranger hound
i suppos there is noth medicin in it said bastin onc when i
wa veri thirsti i made a mistak and drank three tumbler of someth
of the sort in the dark think that it wa apollinari and i dont
want to do it again
just the sort of thing you would do said bicklei but ladi yva
what ar the properti of thi water
it is veri healthgiv she answer and if drunk continu not
less than onc each thirti dai it ward off sick lessen hunger
and postpon death for mani mani year that is why those of the high
blood endur so long and becam the ruler of the world and that as
i have said is the greatest of the reason why the peopl who dwelt in
the ancient outer countri and never wish to die made war upon them
to win thi secret fountain have no fear o bastin for see i will
pledg you in thi water
then she lift a strangelook shallow metal cup whereof the
handl were form of twist serpent that lai in the basin fill
it from the trickl stream bow to us and drank but as she drank i
note with a thrill of joi that her ey were fix on mine as though
it were me she pledg and me alon again she fill the cup with the
sparkl water for it did sparkl like that french liqueur in which
ar mingl littl flake of gold and hand it to me
i bow to her and drank i suppos the fluid wa water but to me it
tast more like strong champagn dash with chateau yquem it wa
delici more it effect were distinctli peculiar someth quick
and subtl ran through my vein someth that for a few moment
seem to burn awai the obscur which blur our thought i began
to understand sever problem that had puzzl me and then lost their
explan in the midst of light inner light i mean moreov of a
sudden it seem to me as though a window had been open in the heart
of that glitter ladi who stood besid me at least i knew that it wa
full of wonder knowledg wonder memori and wonder hope and
that in the latter two of these i had some part what part i could not
tell also i knew that my heart wa open to her and that she saw in it
someth which caus her to marvel and to sigh
in a few second thirti perhap all thi wa gone noth remain
except that i felt extrem strong and well happier too than i had
been for year mute i ask her for more of the water but she shook
her head and take the cup from me fill it again and gave it to
bicklei who drank he flush seem to lose the selfcontrol which
wa hi veri strong characterist and said in a rather thick voic
curiou but i do not think at thi moment there is ani oper that
ha ever been attempt which i could not tackl singlehand and with
success
then he wa silent and bastin turn came he drank rather noisili
after hi fashion and began
my dear young ladi i think the time ha come when i should expound to
you here he broke off and commenc sing veri badli for hi voic
wa somewhat raucou
from greenland ici mountain
from india coral strand
where afric sunni fountain
roll down their golden sand
ceas from melodi he ad
i determin that i would drink noth intox while i wa on
thi island that i might be a shine light in a dark place and now
i fear that quit unwittingli i have broken what i look upon as a
promis
then he too grew silent
come said yva my father the lord oro await you
we cross the court of the water of life and mount step that led
to a wide and impress portico tommi frisk ahead of us in a
most excit wai for a dog of hi experi evid the water had
produc it effect upon him as well as upon hi master thi portico
wa in a solemn style of architectur which i cannot describ becaus
it differ from ani other that i know it wa not egyptian and not
greek although it solid remind me of the former and the beauti
and grace of some of the column of the latter the profus and
rather grotesqu charact of the carv suggest the ruin of mexico
and yucatan and the enorm size of the block of stone those of peru
and baalbec in short all the known form of ancient architectur
might have found their inspir here and the gener effect wa
tremend
the palac of the king said yva whereof we approach the great
hall
we enter through mighti metal door on of which stood ajar into
a vestibul which from certain indic i gather had onc been a
guard or perhap an assemblyroom it wa about forti feet deep by a
hundr wide thenc she led us through a smaller door into the hall
itself it wa a vast place without column for there wa no roof to
support the wall of marbl or limeston were sculptur like those of
egyptian templ appar with battl scene though of thi i am not
sure for i did not go near to them except for a broad avenu along the
middl up which we walk the area wa fill with marbl bench that
would i presum have accommod sever thousand peopl but thei
were emptyempti and oh the loneli of it all
far awai at the head of the hall wa a dai enclos and as it were
roof in by a tower structur that mingl grace and majesti to a
wonder degre it wa model on the pattern of a huge shell the
base of the shell wa the platform behind were the rib and abov the
overhang lip of the shell on thi platform wa a throne of silveri
metal it wa support on the arch coil of snake whereof the tail
form the back and the head the arm of the throne
on thi throne arrai in gorgeou robe sat the lord oro hi white
beard flow over them and a jewel cap upon hi head in front of
him wa a low tabl on which lai graven sheet of metal and among them
a larg ball of crystal
there he sat solemn and silent in the midst of thi aw solitud
look in veri truth like a god as we conceiv such a be to appear
small as he wa in that huge expans of build he seem yet to
domin it in a sens to fill the empti which wa accentu
by hi presenc i know that the sight of him fill me with true fear
which it had never done in the light of dai not even when he aros
from hi crystal coffin now for the first time i felt as though i
were realli in the presenc of a be supernatur doubtless the
surround heighten thi impress what were these mighti edific
in the bowel of the world whenc came thi wondrou allpervad and
transluc light whereof we could see no origin whither had vanish
those who had rear and inhabit them how did it happen that of them
all thi man if he were a man and thi love woman at my side who
if i might trust my sens and instinct wa certainli a woman alon
surviv of their depart multitud
the thing wa crush i look at bicklei for encourag but
got none for he onli shook hi head even bastin now that the first
effect of the lifewat had depart seem overwhelm and mutter
someth about the hall of hade
onli the littl dog tommi remain quit cheer he trot down the
hall jump on to the dai and sat himself comfort at the feet of
it occup
i greet you oro said in hi slow reson voic daughter lead
these stranger to me i would speak with them
chapter xv oro in hi hous
we climb on to the dai by some marbl step and sat ourselv down
in four curiou chair of metal that were more or less copi from that
which serv oro as a throne at least the arm end in graven head of
snake these chair were so comfort that i conclud the seat were
fix on spring also we notic that thei were beautifulli polish
i wonder how thei keep everyth so clean said bastin as we mount
the dai in thi big place it must take a lot of housemaid though i
dont see ani but perhap there is no dust here
i shrug my shoulder while we seat ourselv the ladi yva and i on
oro right bicklei and bastin on hi left as he indic by point
with hi finger
what sai you of thi citi oro ask after a while of me
we do not know what to sai i repli it amaz us in our world
there is noth like to it
perchanc there will be in the futur when the nation grow more
skill in the art of war said oro darkli
be pleas lord oro i went on if it is your will to tell us why
the peopl who built thi place chose to live in the bowel of the earth
instead of upon it surfac
thei did not choos it wa forc upon them wa the answer thi
is a citi of refug that thei occupi in time of war not becaus
thei hate the sun in time of peac and befor the barbarian dare to
attack them thei dwelt in the citi pani which signifi abov you mai
have note some of it remain ruin on the mount and throughout the
island the rest of them ar now beneath the sea but when troubl came
and the foe rain fire on them from the air thei retreat to thi
town nyo which signifi beneath
and then
and then thei di the water of life mai prolong life but it cannot
make women bear children that thei will onli do beneath the blue of
heaven not deep in the belli of the world where natur never design
that thei should dwell how would the voic of children sound in such
hall as these tell me you bicklei who ar a physician
i cannot i cannot imagin children in such a place and if born here
thei would die said bicklei
oro nod
thei did die and if thei went abov to pani thei were murder so
soon the habit of birth wa lost and the son of wisdom perish on by
on ye thei who rule the world and by ten of thousand of year
of toil had gather into their bosom all the secret of the world
perish till onli a few and among them i and thi daughter of mine
were left
and then
then humphrei have power so to do i did what long i had
threaten and unchain the forc that work at the world heart and
destroi them who were my enemi and evil so that thei perish by
million and with them all their work afterward we slept leav
the other our subject who had not the secret of thi sleep to die
as doubtless thei did in the cours of natur or by the hand of the foe
the rest you know
can such a thing happen again ask bicklei in a voic that did not
hide hi disbelief
why do you question me bicklei you who believ noth of what i tell
you and therefor make wrath still i will sai thi that what i caus
to happen i can caus onc moreonli onc i thinka perchanc you
shall learn befor all is done now sinc you do not believ i will
tell you no more of our mysteri no not whenc thi light come nor
what ar the properti of the water of life both of which you long
to know nor how to preserv the vital spark of be in the grave of
dreamless sleep like a live jewel in a casket of dead stone nor aught
els as to these matter daughter i bid you also to be silent sinc
bicklei mock at us ye with all thi around him he who saw us rise
from the coffin still mock at us in hi heart therefor let him
thi littl man of a littl dai when hi few year ar done go to the
tomb in ignor and hi companion with him thei who might have been
as wise as i am
thu oro spoke in a voic of ici rage hi deep ey glow like
coal hear him i curs bicklei in my heart for i wa sure that onc
spoken hi decre wa like to that of the mede and persian and could
not be alter bicklei howev wa not in the least dismai inde
he argu the point he told oro straight out that he would not believ
in the imposs until it had been shown to him to be possibl and
that the law of natur never had been and never could be violat it
wa no answer he said to show him wonder without explain their
caus sinc all that he seem to see might be but mental illus
produc he knew not how

faith as he doe all els hold it with justic or without to be
but anoth illus yet you shall teach me and on it i will form my
own judgment
i shall be delight said bastin then a doubt struck him and he
ad but why do you wish to learn not that you mai make a mock of my
religion is it
i mock at no man belief becaus i think that what men believ is
truefor them i will tell you why i wish to hear of your sinc i
never hide the truth i who am so wise and old yet must die though
that time mai be far awai still i must die for such is the lot of man

beyond the earth tomorrow you shall begin to teach me now leav me
stranger for i have much to do and he wave hi hand toward the
tabl
we rose and bow wonder what he could have to do down in thi
lumin hole he who had been for so mani thousand of year out of
touch with the world it occur to me howev that dure thi long
period he might have got in touch with other world inde he look
like it
wait he said i have someth to tell you i have been studi
thi book of write or world pictur and he point to my atla
which as i now observ for the first time wa also ly upon the
tabl it interest me much your countri is small veri small when
i caus it to be rais up i think that it wa larger but sinc then
that sea have flow in
here bicklei groan aloud
thi on is much greater went on oro cast a glanc at bicklei
that must have penetr him like a searchlight then he open the map
of europ and with hi finger indic germani and austriahungari
i know noth of the peopl of these land he ad but as you
belong to on of them and ar my guest i trust that your mai succe
in the war
what war we ask with on voic
sinc bicklei is so clever sure he should know better than an
illus such as i all i can tell you is that i have learn that there
is war between thi countri and that and he point to great britain
and to germani upon the map also between other
it is quit possibl i said rememb mani thing but how do you
know
if i told you humphrei bicklei would not believ so i will not tell
perhap i saw it in that crystal as did the necromanc of the earli
world or perhap the crystal serv some differ purpos and i saw it
otherwisewith my soul at least what i sai is true
then who will win ask bastin
i cannot read the futur preacher if i could should i ask you to
expound to me your religion which probabl is of no more worth than a
score of other i have studi just becaus it tell of the futur
if i could read the futur i should be a god instead of onli an
earthlord
your daughter call you a god and you said that you knew we were
come to wake you up which is read the futur answer bastin
everi father is a god to hi daughter or should be also in my dai
million name me a god becaus i saw further and struck harder than
thei could as for the rest it came to me in a vision oh bicklei if
you were wiser than you think you ar you would know that all thing
to come ar born elsewher and travel hither like the light from star
sometim thei come faster befor their dai into a singl mind and that
is what men call propheci but thi is a gift which cannot be command
even by me also i did not know that you would come i knew onli that
we should awaken and by the help of men for if none had been present at
that destin hour we must have di for lack of warmth and susten
i deni your hypothesi in toto exclaim bicklei but nobodi paid ani
attent to him
my father said yva rise and bow befor him with her swanlik
grace i have note your command but do you permit that i show the
templ to these stranger also someth of our past
ye ye he said it will save much talk in a savag tongu that is
difficult to me but bring them here no more without my command save
bastin onli when the sun is four hour high in the upper world let
him come tomorrow to teach me and afterward if so i desir or if he
will he can sleep here
i think i would rather not said bastin hurriedli i make no pretens
to be particular but thi place doe not appeal to me as a bedroom
there ar degre in the pleasur of solitud and in short i will not
disturb your privaci at night
oro wave hi hand and we depart down that aw and most dreari hall
i hope you will spend a pleasant time here bastin i said look
back from the doorwai at it cold illumin vast
i dont expect to he answer but duti is duti and if i can drag
that old sinner back from the pit that await him it will be worth
do onli i have my doubt about him to me he seem to bear a strong
famili resembl to beelzebub and he a bad companion week in and
week out
we went through the portico yva lead us and pass the fountain of
lifewat of which she caution us to drink no more at present
and to prevent him from do so drag tommi past it by hi collar
bicklei howev linger under the pretenc of make a further
examin of the statu as i had seen him empti into hi pocket
the content of a cork bottl of quinin tabloid which he alwai
carri with him i guess veri well that hi object wa to procur a
sampl of thi water for futur analysi of cours i said noth and
yva and bastin took no note of what he wa do
when we were clear of the palac of which we had onli seen on hall
we walk across an open space made unutter dreari by the absenc
of ani veget or other sign of life toward a huge build of
gloriou proport that wa construct of black stone or marbl it
is imposs for me to give ani idea of the fright solemn of
thi doom edific for as i think i have said it alon had a roof
stand there in the midst of that brilliant unvari and most
unnatur illumin which came from nowher and yet wa everywher
thu when on lift a foot there it wa between the sole of the boot
and the floor or to express it better the boot threw no shadow
i think thi absenc of shadow wa perhap the most terrifi
circumst connect with that univers and pervad light through
it we walk on to the templ we pass three court pillar all
of them and came to the build which wa larger than st paul
in london we enter through huge door which still stood open and
present found ourselv beneath the tower dome there were no
window why should there be in a place that wa full of light there
wa no ornament there wa noth except black wall and yet the
gener effect wa magnific in it majest grace
in thi place said yva and her sweet voic went whisper round
the wall and the arch dome were buri the king of the son
of wisdom thei lie beneath each in hi sepulchr it entranc is
yonder and she point to what seem to be a chapel on the right
would you wish to see them
somehow i dont care to said bastin the place is dreari enough as
it is without the compani of a lot of dead king
i should like to dissect on of them but i suppos that would not be
allow said bicklei
no she answer i think that the lord oro would not wish you to cut
up hi forefath
when you and he went to sleep why did you not choos the famili
vault ask bastin
would you have found us there she queri by wai of answer then
understand that the invit wa refus by gener consent though
person i should have like to accept it and have never ceas
regret that i did not she move toward a coloss object which
stood beneath the centr of the dome
on a step base not veri differ from that in the cave but much
larger sat a figur drape in a cloak on which wa grave a number of
star doubtless to symbolis the heaven the fasten of the cloak
wa shape like the crescent moon and the footstool on which rest
the figur feet wa fashion to suggest the orb of the sun thi
wa of gold or some such metal the onli spot of bright in all that
templ it wa imposs to sai whether the figur were male or femal
for the cloak fall in long straight fold hid it outlin nor did
the head tell us for the hair also wa hidden beneath the mantl and
the face might have been that of either man or woman it wa terribl in
it solemn and calm and it express wa as remot and mystic as
that of buddha onli more stern also without doubt it wa blind it wa
imposs to mistak the sightless of those stare orb across
the knee lai a nake sword and beneath the cloak the arm were hidden
in it complet simplic the thing wa marvel
on either side upon the pedest knelt a figur of the size of life on
wa an old and wither man with death stamp upon hi face the other
wa a beauti nake woman her hand clasp in the attitud of
prayer and with vagu terror written on her vivid featur
such wa thi gloriou group of which the mean could not be mistaken
it wa fate throne upon the sun wear the constel as hi
garment arm with the sword of destini and worship by life and
death thi interpret i set out to the other
yva knelt befor the statu for a littl while bow her head in
prayer and realli i felt inclin to follow her exampl though in the
end i compromis as did bicklei by take off my hat which like the
other i still wore from forc of habit though in thi place none were
need onli bastin remain cover
behold the god of my peopl said yva have you no rever for it
o bastin
not much he answer except as a work of art you see i worship
fate master i might add that your god doesnt seem to have done much
for you ladi yva as out of all your great there noth left but
two peopl and a lot of old wall and cave
at first she wa inclin to be angri for i saw her start then her
mood chang and she said with a sigh
fate master where doe he dwell
here amongst other place said bastin ill soon explain that to
you
i thank you she repli grave but why have you not explain it
to bicklei then wave her hand to show that she wish for no answer
she went on
friend would you wish to learn someth of the histori of my
peopl
veri much said the irrepress bastin but i would rather the
lectur took place in the open air
that is not possibl she answer it must be here and now or not
at all come stand by me be silent and do not move i am about to set
loos forc that ar danger if disturb
chapter xvi vision of the past
she led us to the back of the statu and point to each of us where
we should remain then she took her place at right angl to us as a
showman might do and for a while stood immov watch her face
onc more i saw it and inde all her bodi inform with that strang
air of power and note that her ey flash and that her hair grew
even more brilliant than wa common as though some abnorm strength
were flow through it and her present she spoke sai
i shall show you first our peopl in the dai of their glori look in
front of you
we look and by degre the vast space of the aps befor us becam
aliv with form at first these were vagu and shadowi not to be
separ or distinguish then thei becam so real that until he wa
reprov by a kick tommi growl at them and threaten to break out
into on of hi peal of bark
a wonder scene appear there wa a palac of white marbl and in
front of it a great courtyard upon which the sun beat vividli at the
foot of the step of the palac beneath a silken awn sat a king
enthron a crown upon hi head and wear gloriou robe in hi hand
wa a jewel sceptr he wa a noblelook man of middl ag and
about him were gather the glitter offic of hi court fair women
fan him and to right and left but a littl behind sat other fair
and jewel women who i suppos were hi wive or daughter
on of the king of the children of wisdom newcrown receiv the
homag of the world said yva
as she spoke there appear walk in front of the throne on by on
other king for all were crown and bore sceptr at the foot of the
throne each of them kneel and kiss the foot of him who sat thereon
as he did so lai down hi sceptr which at a sign he lift again and
pass awai of these king there must have been quit fifti men of all
colour and of variou type white men black men yellow men red men
then came their minist bear gift appar of gold and jewel
which were pile on trai in front of the throne i rememb note an
incid an old fellow with a lame leg stumbl and upset hi trai
so that the content roll hither and thither hi attempt to recov
them were ludicr and caus the monarch on the throne to relax from
hi digniti and smile i mention thi to show that what we wit wa
no set scene but appar a live piec of the past had it been so
the absurd of the bedizen old man tumbl down in the midst of the
gorgeou pageant would certainli have been omit
no it must be life real life someth that had happen and the
same mai be said of what follow for instanc there wa what we call
a review infantri march some of them arm with sword and spear
though these i took to be an ornament bodyguard and other with tube
like savag blowpip of which i could not guess the us there were no
cannon but carriag came by load with bag that had spout to
them probabl these were charg with poison gase there were some
cavalri also mount on a differ stamp of hors from our thicker
set and nearer the ground but with arch neck and fieri ey and i
should sai veri strong these again i take it were ornament then
came other men upon a long machin slung in pair in armour sack
out of which onli their head and arm project thi machin which
resembl an elong bicycl went by at a tremend rate though
whenc it motiv power came did not appear it carri twenti pair
of men each of whom held in hi hand some small but doubtless deadli
weapon that in appear resembl an orang other similar machin
which follow carri from forti to a hundr pair of men
the marvel of the piec howev were the aircraft these came by in
great number sometim thei flew in flock like wild gees sometim
singli sometim in line and sometim in order squadron with
outpost and offic ship and an exact distanc kept between craft and
craft none of them seem to be veri larg or to carri more than
four or five men but thei were extraordinarili swift and as agil as
swallow moreov thei flew as bird do by beat their wing but
again we could not guess whenc came their motiv power
the review vanish and next appear a scene of festiv in a huge
illumin hall the great king sat upon a dai and behind him wa that
statu of fate or on veri similar to it beneath which we stood below
him in the hall were the feaster seat at long tabl clad in the
variou costum of their countri he rose and turn knelt befor
the statu of fate inde he prostrat himself thrice in prayer then
take hi seat again he lift a cup of wine and pledg that vast
compani thei drank back to him and prostrat themselv befor him as
he had done befor the imag of fate onli i note that certain men clad
in sacerdot garment not at all unlik those which ar worn in the
greek church todai remain stand
now all thi exhibit of terrestri pomp fade the next scene wa
simpl that of the deathb of thi same kingw knew him by hi
wizen featur there he lai terribl old and dy physician
women courtier all were there watch the end the tableau vanish
and in place of it appear that of the youth successor amidst
cheer crowd with joi break through the cloud of simul grief
upon hi face it vanish also
thu did great king succe great king for ag upon ag said yva
there were eighti of them and the averag of their reign wa 700
year thei rule the earth as it wa in those dai thei gather up
learn thei wield power their wealth wa boundless thei nurtur
the art thei discov secret thei had intercours with the star
thei were as god but like the god thei grew jealou thei and their
councillor becam a race apart who alon had the secret of long life
the rest of the world and the commonplac peopl about them suffer and
di thei of the household of wisdom live on in pomp for gener
till the earth wa mad with envi of them
fewer and fewer grew the divin race of the son of wisdom sinc
children ar not given to the ag and to those of an ancient outworn
blood then the world said
thei ar great but thei ar not mani let us make an end of them by
number and take their place and power and drink of their lifewat
that thei will not give to us if myriad of us perish by their art
what doe it matter sinc we ar countless so the world made war upon
the son of wisdom see
again a pictur form the sky wa full of aircraft which rain down
fire like flash of lightn upon citi beneath from these citi
leapt up other fire that destroi the swifttravel thing abov
so that thei fell in number like gnat burn by a lamp still more
and more of them came till the citi crumbl awai and the flash that
dart from them ceas to rush upward the son of wisdom were driven
from the face of the earth
again the scene chang now it show thi subterranean hall in which
we stood there wa pomp here yet it wa but a shadow of that which
had been in the earlier dai upon the face of the earth courtier move
about the palac and there were peopl in the radiant street and the
hous for most of them were occupi but rare did the vision show
children come through their gate
of a sudden thi scene shift now we saw that same hall in which we
had visit oro not an hour befor there he sat ye oro himself
upon the dai beneath the overhang marbl shell round him were some
ancient councillor in the bodi of the hall on either side of the
dai were men in militari arrai guard without doubt though their onli
weapon wa a black rod not unlik a ruler if inde it were a weapon
and not a badg of offic
yva whose face had suddenli grown strang and fix began to detail
to us what wa pass in thi scene in a curiou monoton such as a
person might us who wa repeat someth learn by heart thi wa
the substanc of what she said
the case of the son of wisdom is desper but few of them ar left
like other men thei need food which is hard to come by sinc the foe
hold the upper earth and that which their doctor can make here in the
shade doe not satisfi them even though thei drink the lifewat
thei die and die there come an embassi from the high king of the
confeder nation to talk of term of peac see it enter
as she spoke up the hall advanc the embassi at the head of it walk
a young man tall dark handsom and command whose aspect seem in
some wai to be familiar to me he wa richli cloth in a purpl cloak
and wore upon hi head a golden circlet that suggest royal rank
those who follow him were mostli old men who had the astut face
of diplomatist but a few seem to be gener yva continu in her
monoton voic
come the son of the king of the confeder nation the princ who
will be king he bow befor the lord oro he sai great and ancient
monarch of the divin blood heavenborn on your strait and that of
those who remain to you is sore yet on behalf of the nation i am sent
to offer term of peac but thi i mai onli do in the presenc of your
child who is your heiress and the queentob of the son of wisdom
here in the pictur oro wave hi hand and from behind the marbl
shell appear yva herself glorious apparel wear royal
ornament and with her train held by wait ladi she bow to the
princ and hi compani and thei bow back to her more we saw a glanc
of recognit pass between her and the princ
now the real yva by our side point to the shadow yva of the vision or
the pictur whichev it might be call a strang thing to see her
do and went on
the daughter of the lord oro come the princ of the nation salut
her he sai that the great war ha endur for hundr of year
between the children of wisdom fight for absolut rule and the common
peopl of the earth fight for liberti in that war mani million of
the son of the nation had perish brought to their death by fear
art by wizardri and by plagu sown among them by the son of
wisdom yet thei were win for the gloriou citi of the son of
wisdom were destroi and those who remain of them were driven to
dwell in the cave of the earth where with all their strength and magic
thei could not increas but fade like flower in the dark
the lord oro ask what ar the term of peac propos by the nation
the princ answer that thei ar these that the son of wisdom shall
teach all their wisdom to the wise men among the nation that thei
shall give them to drink of the lifewat so that their length of dai
also mai be increas that thei shall ceas to destroi them by sick
and their masteri of the forc which ar hid in the womb of the world
if thei will do these thing then the nation on their part will ceas
from war will rebuild the citi thei have destroi by mean of their
fly ship that rain down death and will agre that the lord oro and
hi seed shall rule them for ever as the king of king
the lord oro ask if that be all the princ answer that it is not
all he sai that when he dwelt a hostag at the court of the son of
wisdom he and the divin ladi the daughter of the lord oro and hi
onli live child learn to love each other he demand and the
nation demand that she shall be given to him to wife that in a dai to
come he mai rule with her and their children after them
see went on yva in her chant dreami voic the lord oro ask hi
daughter if thi be true she sai here the real yva at my side turn
and look me straight in the ey that it is true that she love the
princ of the nation and that if she live a million year she will wed
no other man sinc she who is her father slave in all els is
still the mistress of herself as ha ever been the right of her royal
mother
see again the lord oro the divin king the ancient grow wroth he
sai that it is enough and more than enough that the barbarian
should ask to eat of the bread of hidden learn and to drink of the
lifewat of the son of wisdom gift that were given to them of old
by heaven whenc thei sprang in the begin but that on of them
howev highli place should dare to ask to mix hi blood with that of
the divin ladi the heiress the queen of the earth to be and claim to
share her imperi throne that had been held by her pure race from ag
to ag wa an insult that could onli be purg by death sooner would
he give hi daughter in marriag to an ap than to a child of the
barbarian who had work on them so mani woe and striven to break the
golden fetter of their rule
look again continu yva the lord oro the divin grow angrier
still which in truth he did for never did i see such dread rage
as that which the pictur reveal in him he warn he threaten
he sai that hitherto out of gentl love and piti he ha held hi
hand that he ha strength at hi command which will slai them not by
million in slow war but by ten of million at on blow that will
blot them and their peopl from the face of earth and that will caus
the deep sea to roll where now their pleasant land ar fruit in the
sun thei shrink befor hi furi behold their knee trembl becaus
thei know that he ha thi power he mock them doe the lord oro
he ask for their submiss here and now and that in the name of
the nation thei should take the great oath which mai not be broken
swear to ceas from war upon the son of wisdom and to obei them
in all thing to the end of the earth some of the ambassador would
yield thei look about them like wild thing that ar trap but
mad take the princ he cri that the oath of an ap is of no
account but that he will tear up the children of wisdom as an ap tear
leav and afterward take the divin ladi to be hi wife
look on the lord oro continu the live yva hi wrath leav him
he grow cold and smile hi daughter throw herself upon her knee and
plead with him he thrust her awai she would spring to the side of
the princ he command hi councillor to hold her she cri to the
princ that she love him and him onli and that in a dai to come him
she will wed and no other he thank her sai that as it is with her
so it is with him and that becaus of hi love he fear noth she
swoon the lord oro motion with hi hand to the guard thei lift their
deathrod fire leap from them the princ and hi companion all
save those who were afraid and would have sworn the oath twist and
writh thei turn black thei die the lord oro command those who ar
left to enter their fly ship and bear to the nation of the earth
tide of what befal those who dare to defi and insult him to warn
them also to eat and drink and be merri while thei mai sinc for their
wicked thei ar about to perish
the scene fade and there follow anoth which realli i cannot
describ it repres some vast underground place and what appear
to be a huge mountain of iron cloth in light liter a thing
like an alp rock and spin down a decliv which farther on
separ into two branch becaus of a huge razoredg precipic that
rose between there in the middl of thi vast space with the dazzl
mountain whirl toward him stood oro encas in some transpar
armour as though to keep off heat and with him hi daughter who under
hi direct wa handl someth in the rock behind her then there
wa a blind flash and everyth vanish all of thi pictur
pass so swiftli that we could not grasp it detail onli a gener
impress remain
the lord oro us the strength that is in the world whereof he alon
ha the secret chang the world balanc caus that which wa land
to becom sea and that which wa sea to becom land said yva in her
chant unnatur voic
anoth scene of stupend and chang aw countri were
sink citi crash down volcano were spout fire the end of
the earth seem to be at hand we could see human be run to and
fro in thousand like ant then in huge wave hundr and hundr of
feet high the ocean flow in and all wa troubl yeasti sea
oro carri out hi threat to destroi the nation who had rebel
against him said yva much of the world sink beneath the wave but
in place of it other land aris abov the wave to be inhabit by the
seed of those who remain live in those portion of the earth that the
delug spare
thi horribl vision pass and wa succeed by on more that of oro
stand in the sepulchr of the cave by the side of the crystal coffin
which contain what appear to be the bodi of hi daughter he gaze
at her then drank some potion and laid himself down in the companion
coffin that in which we had found him
all vanish awai and yva appear to wake from some kind of tranc
smile and in her natur voic ask if we had seen enough
quit i answer in a tone that caus her to sai
i wonder what you have seen humphrei myself i do not know sinc it

form of romanc
how is it done ask bicklei almost fierc

so we went past the imag of fate out of the templ down the vast and
lone street so unnatur illumin to the place where we had
first found ourselv on arriv in the depth there we stood
a moment later and we were whirl up as we had whirl down i suppos
that yva came with us though i never saw her do so and the odd thing

laugh so be it bastin shall teach my father down below sinc sun and
shade ar the same to him who onli think of hi religion and you shall
teach me up abov
i am not so certain about bastin and of what he think i said
doubtfulli also will the lord oro permit you to come
ye for in such matter i rule myself also she ad meaningli
he rememb my oath that i will wed no mansav on who is dead
now farewel a while and bid bastin be here when the sun is three hour
high not befor or after
then i left her
chapter xvii yva explain
when i reach the rock i wa pleas to find marama and about twenti
of hi peopl engag in erect the hous that we had order them
to build for our accommod inde it wa nearli finish sinc
housebuild in orofena is a simpl busi the framework of pole
let into palm trunk sinc thei could not be driven into the rock had
been put togeth on the further shore and tow over bodili by cano
the overhang rock form on side of the hous the end were of palm
leav ti to the pole and the roof wa of the same materi the
other side wa left open for the present which in that equabl and
balmi clime wa no disadvantag the whole edific wa about thirti feet
long by fifteen deep and divid into two portion on for sleep
and on for live by a palm leaf partit realli it wa quit a
comfort abod cool and rainproof especi after bastin had built
hi hut in which to cook
marama and hi peopl were veri humbl in their demeanour and implor
us to visit them on the main island i answer that perhap we would
later on as we wish to procur certain thing from the wreck also
he request bastin to continu hi ministr as the latter greatli
desir to do but to thi propos i would not allow him to give ani
direct answer at the moment inde i dare not do so until i wa sure
of oro approv
toward even thei depart in their cano leav behind them the
usual ampl store of provis
we cook our meal as usual onli to discov that what yva had said
about the lifewat wa quit true sinc we had but littl appetit
for solid food though thi return upon the follow dai the same
thing happen upon everi occas after drink of that water which
certainli wa a most invigor fluid never for year had ani of us
felt so well as it caus us to do
so we lit our pipe and talk about our experi though of these
inde we scarc knew what to sai bastin accept them as someth
out of the common of cours but as fact which admit of no
discuss after all he said the old testament told much the same
stori of peopl call the son of god who live veri long live and ran
after the daughter of men whom thei should have left alon and thu
becam the progenitor of a remark race of thi race he presum
that oro and hi daughter were survivor especi as thei spoke of
their famili as heaven born how thei came to surviv wa more than he
could understand and realli scarc worth bother over sinc there
thei were
it wa the same about the delug continu bastin although natur
oro spoke fals or at ani rate grossli exagger when he
declar that he had caus thi catastroph unless inde he wa
talk about a total differ delug though even then he could not
have brought it about it wa curiou howev that the peopl drown
were said to have been wick and oro had the same opinion about those
whom he claim to have drown though for the matter of that he could
not conceiv anyon more wick than oro himself on hi own show he
wa a most reveng person and on who declin to agre to a quit
suitabl allianc appar desir by both parti mere becaus it
offend hi famili pride no on reflect he might be unjust to oro
in thi particular sinc he never told that stori it wa onli shown
in some pictur which veri like were just made up to astonish us
meanwhil it wa hi busi to preach to thi old sinner down in that
hole and he confess honestli that he did not like the job still it
must be done so with our leav he would go apart and seek inspir
which at present seem to be quit lack
thu declaim bastin and depart
dont you tell your opinion about the delug or he mai caus anoth
just to show that you ar wrong call bicklei after him
i cant help that answer bastin certainli i shall not hide the
truth to save oro feel if he ha got ani if he reveng himself
upon us in ani wai we must just put up with it like other martyr
i havent the slightest ambit to be a martyr said bicklei
no shout bastin from a littl distanc i am quit awar of that
as you have often said so befor therefor if you becom on i am
sorri to sai that i do not see how you can expect ani benefit you
would onli be like a man who put a sovereign into the offertori bag in
mistak for a shill the extra nineteen shill will do him no good
at all sinc in hi heart he regret the error and wish that he could
have them back
then he depart leav me laugh but bicklei did not laugh
arbuthnot he said i have come to the conclus that i have gone
quit mad i beg you if i should show sign of homicid mania which
i feel develop in me where bastin is concern or of other abnorm
violenc that you will take whatev step you consid necessari even
to put me out of the wai if that is imper
what do you mean i ask you seem sane enough
sane when i believ that i have seen and experienc a great number of
thing which i know it to be quit imposs that i should have seen
or experienc the onli explan is that i am suffer from
delus
then is bastin suffer from delus too
certainli but that is noth new in hi case
i dont agre with you bickleyabout bastin i mean i am by no mean
certain that he is not the wisest of the three of us he ha a faith and
he stick to it as million have done befor him and that is better
than make spiritu experi as i am sorri to sai i do or
reject thing becaus on cannot understand them as you do which is
onli a form of intellectu vaniti
i wont argu the matter arbuthnot it is of no us i repeat that i
am mad and bastin is mad
how about me i also saw and experienc these thing am i mad too
you ought to be arbuthnot if it isnt enough to drive a man mad
when he see himself exactli reproduc in an utterli imposs
movingpictur show exhibit by an utterli imposs young woman in an
utterli imposs underground citi then i dont know what is
what do you mean i ask start
mean well if you didnt notic it there hope for you
notic what
all that envoi scene there as i thought appear yva do you admit
that
of cours there could be no mistak on that point
veri well then accord to my version there came a man still young
dress in outlandish cloth who made proposit of peac and want
to marri yva who want to marri him is that right
absolut
well and didnt you recognis the man
no i onli notic that he wa a finelook fellow whose appear
remind me of someon
i suppos it must be true muse bicklei that we do not know
ourselv
so the old greek thought sinc he urg that thi should be our
special studi know thyself you rememb
i meant physic not intellectu arbuthnot do you mean to tell
me that you did not recognis your own doubl in that man shave off
your beard and put on hi cloth and no on could distinguish you
apart
i sprang up drop my pipe
now you mention it i said slowli i suppos there wa a resembl
i didnt look at him veri much i wa studi the simulacrum of yva
also you know it is some time sincei mean there ar no pierglass
in orofena
the man wa you went on bicklei with convict if i were
superstiti i should think it a queer sort of omen but as i am not i
know that i must be mad
why after all an ancient man and a modern man might resembl each
other
there ar degre in resembl said bicklei with on of hi
contemptu snort it wont do humphrei my boi he ad i can
onli think of on possibl explanationoutsid of the obviou on of
mad
what is that
the glitter ladi produc what bastin call that cinematograph show
in some wai or other did she not she said that in order to do thi she
loos some hidden forc i suggest that she did noth of the sort
then whenc did the pictur come and why
from her own brain in order to impress us with a cockandbul
fairybook stori if thi were so she would quit natur fill the
role of the lover of the piec with the last man who had happen to
impress her henc the resembl
you presuppos a great deal bicklei includ supernatur cun
and unexampl hypnot influenc i dont know first why she should
be so anxiou to add anoth impress to the mani we have receiv
in thi place and secondli if she wa how she manag to mesmeris
three averag but total differ men into see the same thing my
explan is that you were deceiv as to the like which mind
you i did not recognis nor appar did bastin
bastin never recognis anyth but if you ar in doubt ask
yva herself she ought to know now im off to try to analys that
confound lifewat which i suspect is of the ordinari spring
varieti lighten up with natur carbon acid ga and possibl not
uninfluenc by radium the troubl is that here i can onli appli some
veri elementari test
so he went also in an opposit direct to bastin and i wa left
alon with tommi who annoi me much by attempt continu to
wander off into the cave whenc i must recal him i suppos that my
experi of the dai review beneath the sweet influenc of the
wonder tropic night affect me at ani rate that mystic
side of my natur to which i think i allud at the begin of thi
record sprang into activ and in a sens unholi life the normal
vanish the abnorm took possess and that is unholi to most of us
creatur of habit and tradit at ani rate if we ar british i lost
my foot on the world my spirit began to wander in strang place
of cours alwai suppos that we have a spirit which bicklei would
deni
i gave up reason i surrend myself to unreason it is a not
unpleas process occasion suppos now that all we see and
accept is but the merest fragment of the truth or perhap onli a
refract thereof suppos that we do live again and again and that
our anim principl whatev it might be doe inhabit variou
bodi which natur enough it would shape to it own tast and
like would that tast and like vari so veri much over let
us sai a million year or so which after all is but an hour or a
minut in the aeon of etern
on thi hypothesi which is so wild that on begin to suspect that it
mai be true wa it imposs that i and that murder man of the
far past were in fact ident if the woman were the same preserv
across the gulf in some unknown fashion why should not her lover be the
same what did i sayher lover wa i her lover no i wa the lover of
on who had diedmi lost wife well if i had di and live again
why should notwhi should not that sleeperhav live again dure her
long sleep through all those year the spirit must have had some home
and if so in what shape did it live there were point similar
which rush in upon meoh it wa ridicul bicklei wa right we
were all mad
there wa anoth thing oro had declar that we were at war with
germani if thi were so how could he know it such knowledg would
presum power of telepathi or vision beyond those given to man i could
not believ that he possess these as bicklei said it would be past
experi yet it wa most strang that he who wa uninform as to our
nation histori and danger should have hit upon a countri with which
we might well have been plung into sudden struggl here again i wa
bewild and overcom my brain rock i would seek sleep and in it
escap or at ani rate rest from all these mysteri
on the follow morn we despatch bastin to keep hi rendezv in
the sepulchr at the proper time had we not done so i felt sure that
he would have forgotten it for on thi occas he wa for onc
an unwil mission he tri to persuad on of us to come with
himeven bicklei would have been welcom but we both declar that we
could not dream of interf in such a profession matter also that
our presenc wa forbidden and would certainli distract the attent
of hi pupil
what you mean said the gloomi bastin is that you intend to enjoi
yourselv up here in the femal companionship of the glitter ladi
whilst i sit thousand of feet underground attempt to lighten the
dark of a violent old sinner whom i suspect of be in leagu with
satan
with whom you should be proud to break a lanc said bicklei
so i am in the daylight for instanc when he us your mouth to
advanc hi argument bicklei but thi is anoth matter howev if
i do not appear again you will know that i di in a good caus and i
hope try to recov my remain and give them decent burial also you
might inform the bishop of how i came to my end that is if you ever
get an opportun which is more than doubt
hurri up bastin hurri up said the unfeel bicklei or you will
be late for your appoint and put your wouldb neophyt into a bad
temper
then bastin went carri under hi arm a larg bibl print in the
languag of the south sea island
a littl while later yva appear arrai in her wondrou robe which
be a man it is quit imposs for me to describ she saw us
look at these and after greet us both also tommi who wa
enraptur at her come ask us how the ladi of our countri attir
themselv
we tri to explain with no strike success
you ar as stupid about such matter as were the men of the old world
she said shake her head and laugh i thought that you had with
you pictur of ladi you have known which would show me
now in fact i had in a pocketbook a photograph of my wife in
eveningdress also a miniatur of her head and bust paint on ivori
a beauti piec of work done by a master hand which i alwai wore
these after a moment hesit i produc and show to her
bicklei have gone awai for a littl while to see about someth
connect with hi attempt analysi of the lifewat she examin
them with great eager and as she did so i note that her face grew
tender and troubl
thi wa your wife she said as on who state what she know to be a
fact i nod and she went on
she wa sweet and beauti as a flower but not so tall as i am i
think
no i answer she lack height given that she would have been a
love woman
i am glad you think that women should be tall she said glanc at
her shadow the ey were such as mine were thei notin colour i
mean
ye veri like your onli your ar larger
that is a beauti wai of wear the hair would you be angri if i
tri it i weari of thi old fashion
why should i be angri i ask
at thi moment bicklei reappear and she began to talk of the detail
of the dress sai that it show more of the neck than had been the
custom among the women of her peopl but wa veri pretti
that is becaus we ar still barbarian said bicklei at least our
women ar and therefor reli upon primit method of attract like
the savag yonder
she smile and after a last long glanc gave me back the photograph
and the miniatur sai as she deliv the latter
i rejoic to see that you ar faith humphrei and wear thi pictur
on your heart as well as in it
then you must be a veri remark woman said bicklei never
befor did i hear on of your sex rejoic becaus a man wa faith to
somebodi els
ha bicklei been disappoint in hi loveheart that he is so angri
to us women ask yva innoc of me then without wait for
an answer she inquir of him whether he had been success in hi
analysi of the lifewat
how do you know what i wa do with the lifewat did bastin tell
you exclaim bicklei
bastin told me noth except that he wa afraid of the descent to
nyo that he hate nyo when he reach it as inde i do and that he
thought that my father the lord oro wa a devil or evil spirit from
some underworld which he call hell
bastin ha an open heart and an open mouth said bicklei for which
i respect him follow hi exampl if you will ladi yva and tell us who
and what is the lord oro and who and what ar you
have we not done so alreadi if not i will repeat the lord oro and
i ar two who have live on from the old time when the world wa
differ and yet i think the same he is a man and not a god and i
am a woman hi power ar great becaus of hi knowledg which he ha
gather from hi forefath and in a life of a thousand year befor
he went to sleep he can do thing you cannot do thu he can pass
through space and take other with him and return again he can learn
what is happen in faroff part of the world as he did when he
told you of the war in which your countri is concern he ha terribl
power for instanc he can kill as he kill those savag also he
know the secret of the earth and if it pleas him can chang it
turn so that earthquak happen and sea becom land and land sea
and the place that were hot grow cold and those that were cold grow
hot
all of which thing have happen mani time in the histori of the
globe said bicklei without the help of the lord oro
other had knowledg befor my father and other doubtless will have
knowledg after him even i yva have some knowledg and knowledg is
strength
ye i interpos but such power as you attribut to your father
ar not given to man
you mean to man as you know him man like bicklei who think that he
ha learn everyth that wa ever learn but it is not so hundr
of thousand of year ago men knew more than it seem thei do todai ten
time more as thei live ten time longer or so you tell me
men i said
ye men not god or spirit as the uninstruct nation suppos
them to be my father is a man subject to the hope and terror of man
he desir power which is ambit and when the world refus hi rule
he destroi that part of it which rebel which is reveng moreov
abov all thing he dread death which is fear that is why he
suspend life in himself and me for two hundr and fifti thousand
year as hi knowledg gave him strength to do becaus death wa near
and he thought that sleep wa better than death
why should he dread to die ask bicklei see that sleep and
death ar the same
becaus hi knowledg tell him that sleep and death ar not the same
as you in your foolish believ for there bastin is wiser than
you becaus for all hi wisdom he remain ignor of what happen to
man when the light of life is blown out by the breath of fate that is
why he fear to die and why he talk with bastin the preacher who sai
he ha the secret of the futur
and do you fear to die i ask
no humphrei she answer gentli becaus i think that there is no
death and have done no wrong i dread no evil i had dream while i
wa asleep o humphrei and it seem to me that
here she ceas and glanc at where she knew the miniatur wa hang
upon my breast
now she continu after a littl paus tell me of your world
of it histori of it languag of what happen there for i long to
know
so then and there assist by bicklei i began the educ of the
ladi yva i do not suppos that there wa ever a more apt pupil in the
whole earth to begin with she wa better acquaint with everi subject
on which i touch than i wa myself all she lack wa inform as
to it modern aspect her knowledg end two hundr and fifti thousand
year ago at which date howev it would seem that civilis had
alreadi touch a higher watermark than it ha ever sinc attain
thu thi vanish peopl understood astronomi natur magnet the
forc of graviti steam also electr to some subtl us of which
i gather the light of their underground citi wa to be attribut
thei had master architectur and the art as their build and
statu show thei could fly through the air better than we have
learn to do within the last few year
more thei or some of them had learn the us of the fourth
dimens that is their most instruct individu could move through
oppos thing as well as over them up into them and across them
thi power these possess in a twofold form i mean that thei could
either disintegr their bodi at on spot and caus them to integr
again at anoth or thei could project what the old egyptian call
the ka or doubl and modern theosophist name the astral shape to
ani distanc moreov thi doubl or astral shape while itself
invis still so to speak had the us of it sens it could see
it could hear and it could rememb and on return to the bodi it
could avail itself of the experi thu acquir
thu at least said yva while bicklei contempl her with a cold
and unbeliev ey she even went further and alleg that in certain
instanc individu of her extinct race had been abl to pass through
the ether and to visit other world in the depth of space
have you ever done that ask bicklei
onc or twice i dream that i did she repli quietli
we can all dream he answer
as it wa my lot to make acquaint with thi strang and uncanni
power at a later date i will sai no more of it now
telepathi she declar wa also a develop gift among the son of
wisdom inde thei seem to have us it as we us wireless messag
onli in their case the send and receiv station were skill and
suscept human be who went on duti for so mani hour at a time
thu intellig wa transmit with accuraci and despatch those who
had thi faculti were she said also veri apt at read the mind of
other and therefor not easi to deceiv
is that how you know that i had been try to analys your
lifewat ask bicklei
ye she answer with her unvari smile at the moment i spoke
thereof you were wonder whether my father would be angri if he knew
that you had taken the water in a littl flask she studi him for a
moment then ad now you ar wonder first whether i did not
see you take the water from the fountain and guess the purpos and
secondli whether perhap bastin did not tell me what you were do
with it when we met in the sepulchr
look here said the exasper bicklei i admit that telepathi and
thoughtread ar possibl to a certain limit extent but suppos
that you possess those power as i think in english and you do not
know english how can you interpret what is pass in my mind
perhap you have been teach me english all thi while without
know it bicklei in ani case it matter littl see that what
i read is the thought not the languag with which it is cloth the
thought come from your mind to minethat is if i wish it which is
not oftenand i interpret it in my own or other tongu
i am glad to hear it is not often ladi yva sinc thought ar
gener consid privat
ye and therefor i will read your no more why should i when thei
ar so full of disbelief of all i tell you and sometim of other
thing about myself which i do not seek to know
no wonder that accord to the stori in the pictur those nation
whom you name barbarian made an end of your peopl ladi yva
you ar mistaken bicklei the lord oro made an end of the nation
though against my prayer she ad with a sigh
then bicklei depart in a rage and did not appear again for an hour
he is angri she said look after him nor do i wonder it is hard
for the veri clever like bicklei who think that thei have master all
thing to find that after all thei ar quit ignor i am sorri for
him and i like him veri much
then you would be sorri for me also ladi yva
why she ask with a dazzl smile when your heart is athirst for
knowledg gape for it like a fledgl mouth for food and as
it chanc though i am not veri wise i can satisfi someth of your
soulhung
not veri wise i repeat
no humphrei i think that bastin who in mani wai is so stupid ha
more true wisdom than i have becaus he can believ and accept without
question after all the wisdom of my peopl is all of the univers
and it wonder what you think magic is not magic it is onli gather
knowledg and the find out of secret bicklei will tell you the
same although as yet he doe not believ that the mind of man can
stretch so far
you mean that your wisdom ha in it noth of the spirit
ye humphrei that is what i mean i do not even know if there is such
a thing as spirit our god wa fate bastin god is a spirit and i
think your also
ye
therefor i wish you and bastin to teach me of your god as doe oro
my father i wantoh so much humphrei to learn whether we live after
death
you i exclaim you who accord to the stori have slept for
two hundr and fifti thousand year you who have unless i mistak
hint that dure that sleep you mai have live in other shape do you
doubt whether we can live after death
ye sleep induc by secret art is not death and dure that sleep
the i within might wander and inhabit other shape becaus it is
forbidden to be idl moreov what seem to be death mai not be death
onli anoth form of sleep from which the i awak again upon the world
but at last come the real death when the i is extinguish to the
world that much i know becaus my peopl learn it
you mean you know that men and women mai live again and again upon the
world
ye humphrei i do for in the world there is onli a certain store of
life which in mani form travel on and on till the lot of each i is
fulfil then come the real death and after thatwhat ohwhat
you must ask bastin i said humbl i cannot dare to teach of such
matter
no but you can and do believ and that help me humphrei who am
in tune with you ye it help me much more than do bastin and hi new
religion becaus such is woman wai now i think bicklei will soon
return so let us talk of other matter tell me of the histori of your
peopl humphrei that my father sai ar now at war
chapter xviii the accid
bicklei did return have recov hi temper sinc after all it wa
imposs for anyon to remain angri with the ladi yva for long and we
spent a veri happi time togeth we instruct and she wa the humbl
pupil
how swift and nimbl wa her intellig in that on morn she
learn all our alphabet and how to write our letter it appear that
among her peopl at ani rate in their later period the onli form of
write that wa us wa a highli concentr shorthand which save
labour thei had no journal sinc new which arriv telepath
or by some form of wireless wa proclaim to those who care to listen
and on it all form their own judgment in the same wai poem and even
romanc were repeat as in homer dai or in the time of the nors
saga by word of mouth none of their secret knowledg wa written
down like the ritual of freemasonri it wa consid too sacr
moreov when men live for hundr of year thi wa not so
necessari especi as their great fear wa lest it should fall into
the hand of the outsid nation whom thei call barbarian for be
it rememb these son of wisdom were alwai a veri small peopl
who rule by the weight of their intellig and the strength of their
accumul lore inde thei could scarc be call a peopl rather
were thei a few famili all of them more or less connect with the
origin rule dynasti which consid itself half divin these
famili were wait upon by a multitud of servant or slave drawn
from the subject nation for the most part skill in on art or
anoth or perhap remark for their person beauti still thei
remain outsid the pale
the son of wisdom did not intermarri with them or teach them their
learn or even allow them to drink of their lifewat thei rule
them as men rule dog treat them with kind but no more and as
mani dog run their cours and die in the lifetim of on master so did
mani of these slave in that of on of the son of wisdom therefor
the slave came to regard their lord not as men but god thei live
but three score year and ten like the rest of us and went their wai
thei whose greatgreatgrandfath had serv the same master and
whose greatgreatgreatgrandchildren would still serv him what should
we think of a lord who we knew wa alreadi adult in the time of william
the conqueror and who remain still vigor and allpow in that
of georg v on moreov who command almost infinit knowledg to
which we were deni the kei we might trembl befor him and look upon
him as halfdivin but should we not long to kill him and possess hi
knowledg and therebi prolong our own exist to hi wondrou measur
such said yva wa the case with their slave and the peopl from
whenc these sprang thei grew mad with jealou hate till at length
came the end we knew
thu we talk on for hour till the time came for us to eat as befor
yva partook of fruit and we of such meat as we had at hand these
we notic disgust her becaus as she explain the children of
wisdom unless driven thereto by necess touch no flesh but live
on the fruit of the earth and wine alon onli the slave and the
barbarian at flesh in these view bicklei for onc agre with
her that is except as regard the wine for in theori if not in
practiceh wa a vegetarian
i will bring you more of the lifewat she said and then you will
grow to hate these dead thing as i do and now farewel my father
call me i hear him though you do not tomorrow i cannot come but the
dai after i will come and bring you the lifewat nai accompani me
not but as i see he wish it let tommi go with me i will care for
him and he is a friend in all that lone place
so she went and with her tommi rejoic
ungrat littl devil said bicklei here weve fed and pet
him from puppyhood or at least you have and yet he skip off with the
first stranger i never saw him behav like that to ani woman except
your poor wife
i know i answer i cannot understand it hullo here come
bastin
bastin it wa dishevel and look much the wors for wear also
minu hi bibl in the nativ tongu
well how have you been get on said bicklei
i should like some tea also anyth there is to eat
we suppli him with these necessari and after a while he said slowli
and solemnli
i cannot help think of a childish stori which bicklei told or
invent on night at your hous at home i rememb he had an argument
with my wife which he said put him in mind of it i am sure i dont
know why it wa about a monkei and a parrot that were left togeth
under a sofa for a long while where thei were so quiet that everybodi
forgot them then the parrot came out with onli on feather left in it
tail and none at all on it bodi sai iv had no end of a time
after which it drop down and di do you know i feel just like that
parrot onli i dont mean to die and i think i gave the monkei quit as
good as he gave me
what happen i ask intens interest
oh the glitter ladi took me into that palac hall where oro wa
sit like a spider in a web and left me there i got to work at
onc he wa much interest in the old testament stori and said there
were point of truth about them although thei had evid come down
to the modern writerh call him a modern writerin a legendari
form i thought hi remark impertin and with difficulti refrain
from sai so leav the stori of the delug and all that i spoke of
other matter tell him of etern life and heaven and hell of which
the poor benight man had never heard i point out especi that
unless he repent hi life by all account had been so wick that
he wa certainli destin to the latter place
what did he sai to that i ask
do you know i think it frighten him if on could imagin oro be
frighten at ani rate he remark that the truth or falsiti of what i
said wa an urgent matter for him as he could not expect to live more
than a few hundr year longer though perhap he might prolong the
period by anoth spell of sleep then he ask me why i thought him so
wick i repli becaus he himself said that he had drown million
of peopl which show an evil heart and intent even if it were
not a fact he thought a long while and ask what could be done in the
circumst i repli that repent and repar were the onli
cours open to him
repar i exclaim
ye repar wa what i said though i think i made a mistak there
as you will see as nearli as i can rememb he answer that he wa
begin to repent as from all he had learn from us he gather
that the race which had arisen as a consequ of hi action were
wors than those which he had destroi as regard repar what
he had done onc he could do again he would think the matter over
serious and see if it were possibl and advis to rais those
part of the world which had been sunk and sink those which had been
rais if so he thought that would make veri handsom amend to the
depart nation and set him quit right with ani superior power if
such a thing exist what ar you laugh at bicklei i dont think
it a laugh matter sinc such remark do not seem to me to indic
ani real chang in oro heart which is what i wa try to effect
bicklei who wa convuls with merriment wipe hi ey and said
you dear old donkei dont you see what you have done or rather would
have done if there were a word of truth in all thi ridicul stori
about a delug you would be in the wai of make your preciou pupil
who certainli is the most masterli old liar in the world repeat hi
offenc and send europ to the bottom of the sea
that did occur to me but it doesnt much matter as i am quit certain
that such a thing would never be allow of cours there wa a real
delug onc but oro had no more to do with it than i had dont you
agre arbuthnot
i think so i answer cautious but realli in thi place i am
begin to lose count of what is or is not possibl also of cours
there mai have been mani delug inde the histori of the world show
that thi wa so it is written in it geolog strata what wa the
end of it
the end wa that he took the south sea bibl and after i had explain
a littl about our letter seem to be abl to read it at onc i
suppos he wa acquaint with the art of print in hi youth at ani
rate he said that he would studi it i dont know how unless he can
read and that in two dai time he would let me know what he thought
about the matter of my religion then he told me to go i said that i
did not know the wai and wa afraid of lose myself thereupon he wave
hi hand and i realli cant sai what happen
did you levit up here ask bicklei like the late lament mr
home at the spiritualist seanc
no i did not exactli levit but someth or someon seem to get
a hold of me and i wa just rush along in a most tumultu fashion
the next thing i knew wa that i wa stand at the door of that
sepulchr though i have no recollect of go up in the lift or
whatev it is i believ those beastli cave ar full of ghost or
devil and the worst of it is that thei have kept my solartop which
i put on thi morn forget that it would be useless there
the ladi yva fourth dimens in action i suggest onli it
wouldnt work on solartop
i dont know what you ar talk about said bastin but if my hat
had to be left why not my boot and other garment pleas stop your
nonsens and pass the tea thank good i havent got to go down there
tomorrow as he seem to have had enough of me for the present so i
vote we all pai a visit to the ship it will be a veri pleasant chang
i couldnt stand two dai run with that old fiend and hi ghost or
devil in the cave
next morn accordingli fear no harm from the orofenan we took
the cano and row to the main island marama had evid seen
us come for he and a number of hi peopl met us with everi
demonstr of delight and escort us to the ship here we found
thing just as we had left them for there had been no attempt at theft
or other mischief
while we were in the cabin a fit of moral weak seem to overcom
bicklei the first and i mai add the last from which i ever saw him
suffer
do you know he said address us i think that we should do
well to try to get out of thi place elimin a great deal of the
marvel with which we seem to have come in touch here it is
still obviou that we find ourselv in veri peculiar and unhealthi
surround i mean mental unhealthi inde i think that if we stai
here much longer we shall probabl go off our head now that boat on
the deck remain sound and seaworthi why should not we provis her
and take our chanc we know more or less which wai to steer
bastin and i look at each other it wa he who spoke first
wouldnt it be rather a riski job in an open boat he ask howev
that doesnt matter much becaus i dont take ani account of risk
know that i am of more valu than a sparrow and that the hair of my
head ar all number
thei might be number under water as well as abov it mutter
bicklei and i feel sure that on your own show you would be as
valuabl dead as aliv
what i seem to feel went on bastin is that i have work to my hand
here also the locum tenen at fulcomb no doubt run the parish as
well as i could inde i consid him a better man for the place than
i am that old oro is a tough proposit but i do not despair of him
yet and besid him there is the glitter ladi a most openmind
person whom i have not yet had ani real opportun of approach in
a spiritu sens then there ar all these nativ who cannot learn
without a teacher so on the whole i think i would rather stai where i
am until provid point out some other path
i am of the same opinion if for somewhat differ reason i said
i do not suppos that it ha often been the fortun of men to come in
touch with such thing as we have found upon thi island thei mai be
illus but at least thei ar veri interest illus on might
live ten lifetim and find noth els of the sort therefor i should
like to see the end of the dream
bicklei reflect a littl then said
on the whole i agre with you onli my brain totter and i am terribl
afraid of mad i cannot believ what i seem to hear and see and
that wai mad li it is better to die than to go mad
youll do that anywai when your time come bicklei i mean deceas
of cours interrupt bastin and who know perhap all thi is an
opportun given by provid to open your ey which i must sai
ar singularli blind you think you know everyth there is to learn
but the fact is that like the rest of us you know noth at all and
good man though you ar obstin refus to admit the truth and to
seek support elsewher for my part i believ that you ar afraid of
fall in love with that glitter ladi and of be convinc by her
that you ar wrong in your most unsatisfactori conclus
i am outvot anywai said bicklei and for the rest bastin look
after yourself and leav me alon i will add that on the whole i think
you ar both right and that it is wisest for us to stop where we ar
for after all we can onli die onc
i am not so sure bicklei there is a thing call the second death
which is what is troubl that old scoundrel oro now i will go and
look for those book
so the idea of flight wa abandon although i admit that even to
myself it had attract for i felt that i wa be wrap in a
net of mysteri from which i saw no escap ye and of more than
mysteri i who had sworn that i would never look upon anoth woman
wa learn to love thi sweet and wondrou yva and of that what could
be the end
we collect all we had come to seek and start homeward escort
by marama and hi peopl includ a number of young women who danc
befor us in a light arrai of flower
pass our old hous we came to the grove where the idol oro had stood
and bastin wa so nearli sacrif there wa anoth idol there now
which he wish to examin but in the end did not as the nativ so
obvious object inde marama told me that notwithstand the
mysteri death of the sorcer on the rock of offer there wa
still a strong parti in the island who would be glad to do us a mischief
if ani further affront were offer to their hereditari god
he question us also tent about the apparit for such he
conceiv it to be which had appear upon the rock and kill the
sorcer and i answer him as i thought wisest tell him that a
terribl power wa afoot in the land which he would do well to obei
ye he said the god of the mountain of whom the tradit ha come
down to us from our forefath he is awak again he see he hear
and we ar afraid plead with him for us o friendfromthesea
as he spoke we were pass through a littl patch of thick bush
suddenli from out of thi bush i saw a lad appear he wore a mask upon
hi face but from hi shape could not have been more than thirteen or
fourteen year of ag in hi hand wa a wooden club he ran forward
stop and with a yell of hate hurl it i think at bastin but it
hit me at ani rate i felt a shock and rememb no more
dream dream endless dream what were thei all about i do not know
it seem to me that through them continu i saw the state figur
of old oro contempl me grave as though he were make up hi
mind about someth in which i must plai a part then there wa anoth
figur that of the graciou but imperi yva who from time to time
as i thought leant over me and whisper in my ear word of rest
and comfort nor wa thi all sinc her shape had a wai of chang
suddenli into that of my lost wife who would speak with her voic or
perhap my wife would speak with yva voic to my disord sens it
wa as though thei were on person have two shape either of
which could be assum at will it wa most strang and yet to me most
bless sinc in the live i seem to have found the dead and in the
dead the live more i took journei or rather some unknown part of
me seem to do so on of these i rememb for it majest charact
stamp itself upon my mind in such a fashion that all the water of
delirium could not wash it out nor all it wind blow awai that memori
i wa travel through space with yva a thousand time faster than
light can flash we pass sun after sun thei drew near thei grew into
enorm flame glori round which circl world upon world thei
becam small dwindl to point of light and disappear
we found foot upon some far land and pass a marvel white citi
wherein were build with dome of crystal and alabast in the
latter of which were set window made of great jewel sapphir or
rubi thei seem to me we went on up a love vallei to the left
were hill down which tumbl waterfal to the right wa a river
broad and deep that seem to overflow it bank as doe the nile
behind were high mountain on the slope of which grew forest of
gloriou tree some of them aflam with bloom while far awai up their
crest stood coloss golden statu set wide apart thei look like
guardian angel watch that citi and that vale the land wa lit with
a light such as that of the moon onli intensifi and of mani colour
inde look up i saw that abov us float three moon each of them
bigger than our own at the full and gather that here it wa night
we came to a hous set amid scent garden and have in front of it
terrac of flower it seem not unlik my own hous at home but i
took littl note of it becaus of a woman who sat upon the verandah if
i mai call it so she wa clad in garment of white silk fasten about
her middl with a jewel girdl on her neck also wa a collar of
jewel i forget the colour inde thi seem to chang continu
as the light from the differ moon struck when she move but i
think it prevail ting wa blue in her arm thi woman nurs a
beauteou sleep child sing happili as she rock it to and
fro yva went toward the woman who look up at her step and utter a
littl cry then for the first time i saw the woman face it wa that
of my dead wife
as i follow in my dream a littl cloud of mist seem to cover both
my wife and yva and when i reach the place yva wa gone onli my wife
remain she and the child there she stood solemn and sweet while i
drew near she laid down the child upon the cushion seat from which
she had risen she stretch out her arm and flung them about me she
embrac me and i embrac her in a raptur of reunion then turn she
lift up the child it wa a girl for me to kiss
see your daughter she said and behold all that i am make readi
for you where we shall dwell in a dai to come
i grew confus
yva i said where is yva who brought me here did she go into the
hous
ye she answer happili yva went into the hous look again
i look and it wa yva face that wa press against my own and
yva ey that gaze into mine onli she wa garb as my wife had
been and on her bosom hung the chang necklac
you mai not stai she whisper and lo it wa my wife that spoke
not yva
tell me what it mean i implor
i cannot she answer there ar mysteri that you mai not know as
yet love yva if you will and i shall not be jealou for in love yva
you love me you cannot understand then know thi that the spirit ha
mani shape and yet is the same spiritsometim now i who am far
yet near bid you farewel a while
then all pass in a flash and the dream end
such wa the onli on of those vision which i can recal
i seem to wake up as from a long and tumultu sleep the first thing
i saw wa the palm roof of our hous upon the rock i knew it wa our
hous for just abov me wa a palm leaf of which i had myself ti the
stalk to the framework with a bit of colour ribbon that i had chanc
to find in my pocket it came origin from the programm card of
a danc that i had attend at honolulu and i had kept it becaus i
thought it might be us final i us it to secur that loos leaf
i stare at the ribbon which brought back a flood of memori and as i
wa thu engag i heard voic talk and listenedbicklei voic
and the ladi yva
ye bicklei wa sai he will do well now but he went near veri
near
i knew he would not die she answer becaus my father said so
there ar two sort of death repli bicklei that of the bodi and
that of the mind i wa afraid that even if he live hi reason would
go but from certain indic i do not think that will happen now he
will get quit well againthough and he stop
i am veri glad to hear you sai so chime in bastin for week
i thought that i should have to read the burial servic over poor
arbuthnot inde i wa much puzzl as to the best place to buri him
final i found a veri suitabl spot round the corner there where it
isnt rock in which on cant dig and the soil is not liabl to be
flood in fact i went so far as to clear awai the bush and to mark out
the grave with it foot to the east in thi climat on cant delai
you know
weak as i wa i smile thi practic proceed wa so exactli like
bastin
well you wast your labour exclaim bicklei
ye i am glad to sai i did but i dont think it wa your oper
and the rest that cure him bicklei although you take all the credit
i believ it wa the lifewat that the ladi yva made him drink and the
stuff that oro sent which we gave him when you werent look
then i hope that in the futur you will not interfer with my case
said the indign bicklei and either the voic pass awai or i went
to sleep
when i woke up again it wa to find the ladi yva seat at my side
watch me
forgiv me humphrei becaus i here other gone out walk she
said slowli in english
who taught you my languag i ask astonish bastin and bicklei
while you ill thei teach thei teach me much man just same now as he
wa hundr thousand year ago she ad enigmat all think on
woman beauti when no other woman there
inde i repli wonder to what proceed on the part of
bastin and bicklei she allud could that selfcentr pairoh it wa
imposs
how long have i been ill i ask to escap the subject which i felt
to be uncomfort
she lift her beauti ey in search of word and began to count upon
her finger
two moon on half moon ye ten week count sabbath she answer
triumphantli
ten week i exclaim
ye humphrei ten whole week and three dai you first bad then mad
oh she went on break into the orofenan tongu which she spoke so
perfectli although it wa not her own that languag of her i never
learn but i know she thought in it and onli translat into orofenan
becaus of the great difficulti which she had in render her high and
refin idea into it simpler metaphor and the strang word which
often she introduc oh you have been veri ill friend of my heart
at time i thought that you were go to die and wept and wept
bicklei think that he save you and he is veri clever but he could not
have save you that want more knowledg than ani of your peopl have
onli i prai you do not tell him so becaus it would hurt hi pride
what wa the matter with me then yva
all wa the matter first the weapon which that youth threwh wa
the son of the sorcer whom my father destroyedcrush in the bone
of your head he is dead for hi crime and mai he be accurs for ever
she ad in the onli outbreak of rage and vindict in which i
ever saw her indulg
on must make excus for him hi father had been kill i said
ye that is what bastin tell me and it is true still for that
young man i can make no excus it wa cowardli and wick well
bicklei perform what he call oper and the lord oro he came up
from hi hous and help him becaus bastin is no good in such thing
then he can onli turn awai hi head and prai i too help hold
hot water and linen and jar of the stuff that made you feel like
noth although the sight made me feel more sick than anyth sinc i
saw on i love kill oh long long ago
wa the oper success i ask for i did not dare to begin to
thank her
ye that clever man bicklei lift the bone which had been crush
in onli then someth broke in your head and you began to bleed here
and she touch what i believ is call the tempor arteri the vein
had been crush by the blow and gave wai bicklei work and work
and just in time he ti it up befor you di oh then i felt as
though i love bicklei though afterward bastin said that i ought to
have love him sinc it wa not bicklei who stop the bleed but
hi prayer
perhap it wa both i suggest
perhap humphrei at least you were save then came anoth troubl
you took fever bicklei said that it wa becaus a certain gnat had
bitten you when you went down to the ship and my father the lord oro
told me that thi wa right at the least you grew veri weak and lost
your mind and it seem as though you must die then humphrei i went
to the lord oro and kneel befor him and prai for your life for i
knew that he could cure you if he would though bicklei skill wa at
an end
daughter he said to me not onc but again and again you have set
up your will against mine in the past why then should i troubl myself
to grant thi desir of your in the present and save a man who is
noth to me
i rose to my feet and answer i do not know my father yet i am
certain that for your own sake it will be well to do so i am sure that
of everyth even you must give an account at last great though you
be and who know perhap on life which you have save mai turn the
balanc in your favour
sure the priest bastin ha been talk to you he said
he ha i answer and not he alon mani voic have been talk
to me
what did you mean by that i ask
it matter noth what i meant humphrei be still and listen to my
stori my father thought a while and answer
i am jealou of thi stranger what is he but a shortliv
halfbarbarian such as we knew in the old dai and yet alreadi you
think more of him than you do of me your father the divin oro who ha
live a thousand year at first i help that physician to save him
but now i think i wish him dead
if you let thi man die my father i answer then we part
rememb that i also have of the wisdom of our peopl and can us it if
i will
then save him yourself he said
perhap i shall my father i answer but if so it will not be
here i sai that if so we part and you shall be left to rule in your
majesti alon
now thi frighten the lord oro for he ha the weak that he hate
to be alon
if i do what you will do you swear never to leav me yva he ask
know that if you will not swear the man di
i swear i answeredfor your sake humphreythough i did not love
the oath
then he gave me a certain medicin to mix with the lifewat and when
you were almost gone that medicin cure you though bicklei doe not
know it as noth els could have done now i have told you the truth
for your own ear onli humphrei
yva i ask why did you do all thi for me
humphrei i do not know she answer but i think becaus i must
now sleep a while
chapter xix the propos of bastin and bicklei
so far as my bodi wa concern i grew well with great rapid though
it wa long befor i got back my strength thu i could not walk far or
endur ani sustain exert with my mind it wa otherwis i can not
explain what had happen to it inde i do not know but in a sens it
seem to have becom detach and to have assum a kind of person
of it own at time it felt as though it were no longer an inhabit
of the bodi but rather it more or less independ partner i wa
perfectli clearhead and of insan i experienc no symptom yet my
mind i us that term from lack of a better wa not entir under my
control for on thing at night it appear to wander far awai though
whither it went and what it saw there i could never rememb
i record thi becaus possibl it explain certain mysteri event if
thei were event and not dream which shortli i must set out i spoke
to bicklei about the matter he put it by lightli sai that it wa
onli a result of my long and most sever ill and that i should
steadi down in time especi if we could escap from that island and
it unnatur atmospher yet as he spoke he glanc at me shrewdli
with hi quick ey and when he turn to go awai i heard him mutter
someth to himself about unholi influenc and that confound old
oro
the word were spoken to himself and quit beneath hi breath and of
cours not meant to reach me but on of the curiou concomit of my
state wa that all my sens and especi my hear had becom most
abnorm acut a whisper far awai wa now to me like a loud remark
made in a room
bicklei reflect for i can scarc call it more set me think
yva had said that oro sent me medicin which wa administ to me
without bicklei knowledg and as she believ save my life or
certainli my reason what wa in it i wonder then there wa that
lifewat which yva brought and insist upon my drink everi dai
undoubtedli it wa a marvel tonic and did me good but it had other
effect also thu as she said would be the case after a cours of
it i conceiv the greatest dislik which i mai add ha never entir
left me of ani form of meat also of alcohol all i seem to want wa
thi water with fruit or such nativ veget as there were bicklei
disapprov and made me eat fish occasion but even thi revolt
me and sinc i gain steadili in weight as we found out by a simpl
contriv and remain healthi in everi other wai soon he allow me
to choos my own diet
about thi time oro began to pai me frequent visit he alwai came at
night and what is more i knew when he wa come although he never
gave me warn here i should explain that dure my ill bastin
who wa so ingeni in such matter had built anoth hut in which he
and bicklei slept of cours when thei were not watch me leav our
old bedchamb to myself
well i would wake up and be awar that oro wa come then he appear
in a silent and mysteri wai as though he had materialis in the
room for i never saw him pass the doorwai in the moonlight or the
starlight which flow through the entranc and the side of the hut
that wa onli enclos with latticework i perceiv him seat himself
upon a certain stool look like a most majest ghost with hi
flow robe long white beard hook nose and hawk ey in the
daytim he much resembl the late gener booth whom i had often
seen except for certain ad qualiti of height and classic beauti of
counten at night howev he resembl no on but himself inde
there wa someth mighti and godlik in hi appear someth that
made on feel that he wa not as ar other men
for a while he would sit and look at me then he began to speak in a
low vibrant voic what did he speak of well mani matter it wa as
though he were unburden that hoari soul of hi becaus it could no
longer endur the grandeur of it own loneli amongst sundri secret
thing he told me of the past histori of thi world of our and of the
mighti civilis which for uncount ag he and hi forefath had
rule by the strength of their will and knowledg of the dwindl
of their race and of the final destruct of it enemi although i
notic that now he no longer said that thi wa hi work alon on
night i ask him if he did not miss all such pomp and power
then suddenli he broke out and for the first time i realli learn what
ambit can be when it utterli possess the soul of man
ar you mad he ask that you suppos that i oro the king of
king can be content to dwell solitari in a great cave with none but
the shadow of the dead to serv me nai i must rule again and be even
greater than befor or els i too will die better to face the futur
even if it mean oblivion than to remain thu a relic of a gloriou
past still live and yet dead like that statu of the great god fate
which you saw in the templ of my worship
bastin doe not think that the futur mean oblivion i remark
i know it i have studi hi faith and find it too humbl for my
tast also too new shall i oro creep a suppliant befor ani power
and confess what bastin is pleas to call my sin nai i who am great
will be the equal of all great or noth
he paus a while then went on
bastin speak of etern where and what then is thi etern which
if it ha no end can have had no begin i know the secret of the
sun and their attend world and thei ar no more etern than the
insect which glitter for an hour out of shapeless rush gase thei
gather to live their dai and into gase at last thei dissolv again
with all thei bore
ye i answer but thei reform into new world
that have no part with the old thi world too will melt depart
to whenc it came as your sacr write sai and what then of those
who dwelt and dwell thereon no man of todai give me time in which i
rule and keep your dream of an etern that is not and in which you
must still crawl and serv even if it were yet if i might i confess
it i would live on for ever but as master not as slave
on anoth night he began to tempt me veri subtli i see a spark of
great in you humphrei he said and it come into my heart that
you too might learn to rule with yva the last of my blood it is
otherwis she is the child of my ag and of a race outworn too gentl
too much all womanli the soul that triumph must shine like steel in
the sun and cut if need be not mere be beauteou and shed perfum
like a lili in the shade yet she is veri wise and fair here he
look at me perchanc of her might come children such as were their
forefath who again would wield the sceptr of the dominion of the
earth
i made no answer wonder what he meant exactli and think it wisest
to be silent
you ar of the shortliv race he went on yet veri much a man
not without intellig and by the art i have i can so strengthen
your frame that it will endur the shock of time for three such live
as your or perchanc for more and then
again he paus and went on
the daughter of king like you also perhap becaus you resembl
here he fix me with hi pierc ey a certain kinglet of base
blood whom onc she also like but whom it wa my duti to destroi
well i must think i must studi thi world of your also and therein
you mai help me perhap afterward i will tell you how now sleep
in anoth moment he wa gone but notwithstand hi power command
for a while i could not sleep i understood that he wa offer yva to
me but upon what term that wa the question with her wa to go great
dominion over the kingdom of the earth i could not help rememb
that alwai thi ha been and still is satan favourit bait to me it
did not particularli appeal i had been ambiti in my timewho is
not that is worth hi salt i could have wish to excel in someth
literatur or art or whatev it might be and thu to ensur the
memori of my name in the world
of cours thi is a most futil desir see that soon or late everi
name must fade out of the world like an unfix photograph which is
expos to the sun even if it could endur as the old demigod or
demidevil oro had point out veri shortli by comparison with time
unmeasur vast the whole solar system will also fade so of what
us is thi feebl love of fame and thi vain attempt to be rememb
that anim us so strongli moreov the idea of enjoi mere
tempor as oppos to intellectu power appeal to me not at all
i am a student of histori and i know what ha been the lot of king and
the evil that often enough thei work in their littl dai
also if i need ani further exampl there wa that of oro himself he
had outliv the great of hi hous as a royal famili is call
and after some gigant murder if hi own stori wa to be believ
indulg in a prolong sleep now he awok to find himself quit
alon in the world save for a daughter with whom he did not agre or
sympathis in short he wa but a kind of anim mummi inspir by
on idea which i felt quit sure would be disappoint name to renew
hi former great to me he seem as miser a figur as on could
imagin brood and plot in hi illumin cave at the end of an
extend but misspent life
also i wonder what he or rather hi ego had been do dure all
those two hundr and fifti thousand year of sleep possibl if yva
theori as i understood it were correct he had reincarn as attila
or tamerlan or napoleon or even as chaka the terribl zulu king
at ani rate there he wa still in the world fill with the dread
of death but consum now as ever by hi insati and most useless
finit ambit
yva also her case wa hi but yet how differ in all thi long
night of time she had but ripen into on of the sweetest and most
gentl women that ever the world bore she too wa great in her wai
it appear in her everi word and gestur but where wa the feroc
of her father where hi desir to reach to splendour by tread on a
bloodstain road pave with broken human heart it did not exist
her natur wa differ although her bodi came of a long line of these
powerlov king why thi profound differ of the spirit like
everyth els it wa a mysteri the two were as far apart as the
pole everyon must have hate oro from the begin howev much he
fear him but everyon who came in touch with her must have love yva
here i mai break into my person narr to sai that thi by their
own confess prove to be true of two such variou person as bastin
and bicklei
the truth which i am sure it would be wrong to hide from you
arbuthnot said the former to me on dai is that dure your long
ill i fell in love i suppos that is the right word with the
glitter ladi after think the matter over also i conceiv that
it would be proper to tell her so if onli to clear the air and prevent
futur misunderstand as i remark to her on that occas i had
hesit long as i wa not certain how she would fill the place of the
wife of the incumb of an english parish
mother meet and the rest i suggest
exactli so arbuthnot also there were the view of the bishop to be
consid who might have object to the introduct into the dioces
of a strike person who so recent had been a heathen and to on in
such strong contrast to my late belov wife
i suppos you didnt consid the late mr bastin view on the
subject of remarriag i rememb that thei were strong i remark
rather malici
no i did not think it necessari sinc the scriptur instruct on
the matter ar veri clear and in anoth world no doubt all jealousi
even sarah will be obliter upon that point my conscienc wa
quit easi so when i found that unlik her parent the ladi yva wa
much inclin to accept the principl of the faith in which it is my
privileg to instruct her i thought it proper to sai to her that if
ultim she made up her mind to do soof cours thi wa a sine qua
noni should be much honour and as a man not as a priest it
would make me most happi if she would take me as a husband of cours
i explain to her that i consid under the circumst i could
quit lawfulli perform the marriag ceremoni myself with you and bicklei
as wit even should oro refus to give her awai also i told
her that although after her vari experi in the past life at
fulcomb if we could ever get there might be a littl monoton
still it would not be entir devoid of interest
you mean christma decor and that sort of thing
ye and choir treat and entertain deput and attend other
church activ
well and what did she sai bastin
oh she wa most kind and flatter inde that hour will alwai
remain the pleasantest of my life i dont know how it happen but
when it wa over i felt quit delight that she had refus me inde
on second thought i am not certain but that i shall be much happier in
the capac of a brother and teacher which she ask me to fill than
i should have been as her husband to tell you the truth arbuthnot
there ar moment when i am not sure whether i entir understand the
ladi yva it wa rather like propos to on guardian angel
ye i said that about it old fellow guardian angel is not a
bad name for her
afterward i receiv the confid of bicklei
look here arbuthnot he said i want to own up to someth i
think i ought to becaus of certain thing i have observ in order to
prevent possibl futur misunderstand
what that i ask innoc
onli thi as you know i have alwai been a confirm bachelor
on principl women introduc too mani complic into life and
although it involv some sacrific on the whole i have thought
it best to do without them and leav the carri on of the world to
other
well what of it your view ar not singular bicklei
onli thi while you were ill the sweet of that ladi yva and her
wonder qualiti as a nurs overcam me i went to piec all of a
sudden i saw in her a realis of everi ideal i had ever entertain
of perfect womanhood so to speak my resolv of a lifetim melt like
wax in the sun notwithstand her queer histori and the marvel with
which she is mix up i wish to marri her no doubt her physic
loveli wa at the bottom of it but howev that mai be there it
wa
she is beauti i comment though i daresai older than she
look
that is a point on which i made no inquiri and i should advis you
when your turn come as no doubt it will to follow my exampl you
know arbuthnot he muse howev love a woman mai be it would put
on off if suddenli she announc that she waslet us saya hundr
and fifti year old
ye i admit for nobodi want to marri the contemporari of hi
greatgrandmoth howev she gave her ag as twentyseven year and
three moon
and doubtless for onc did not tell the truth but as she doe not
look more than twentyf i think that we mai all agre to let it
stand at that name twentyseven plu an indefinit period of sleep
at ani rate she is a sweet and most graciou woman appar in the
bloom of youth and to cut it short i fell in love with her
like bastin i said
bastin exclaim bicklei indignantli you dont mean to sai that
cleric oaf presumedwel well after all i suppos that he is a
man so on mustnt be hard on him but who could have thought that he
would run so cun even when he knew my sentiment toward the ladi
i hope she told him her mind
the point is what did she tell you bicklei
me oh she wa perfectli charm it realli wa a pleasur to be
refus by her she put on so thoroughli at on eas here
rememb bastin and hi stori i turn awai my face to hide a
smile she saidwhat did she sai exactli such a lot that it is
difficult to rememb oh that she wa not think of marriag also
that she had not yet recov from some recent love affair which left
her heart sore sinc the time of her sleep did not count also that
her father would never consent and that the mere idea of such a thing
would excit hi animos against all of us
is that all i ask
not quit she ad that she felt wonderfulli flatter and extrem
honour by what i had been so good as to sai to her she hope
howev that i should never repeat it or even allud to the matter
again as her dearest wish wa to be abl to look upon me as her most
intim friend to whom she could alwai come for sympathi and counsel
what happen then
noth of cours except that i promis everyth that she wish
and mean to stick to it too natur i wa veri sore and upset but
i am get over it have alwai practis selfcontrol
i am sorri for you old fellow
ar you he ask suspici then perhap you have tri your
luck too
no bicklei
hi face fell a littl at thi denial and he answer
well it would have been scarc decent if you had see how late
you were marri but then so wa that art bastin perhap you will
get over itrec marriag i meana he ha he hesit a while
then went on of cours you will old fellow i know it and what is
more i seem to know that when your turn come you will get a differ
answer if so it will keep her in the famili as it wereand good luck
to you onli
onli what i ask anxious
to be honest arbuthnot i dont think that there will be real good
luck for ani on of us over thi womannot in the ordinari sens i
mean the whole busi is too strang and superhuman is she quit a
woman and could she realli marri a man as other do
it is curiou that you should talk like that i said uneasili i
thought that you had made up your mind that the whole busi wa
either illus or trickeryi mean the odd side of it
if it is illus arbuthnot then a man cannot marri an illus and
if it is trickeri then he will certainli be trick but suppos
that i am wrong what then
you mean suppos thing ar as thei seem to be
ye in that event arbuthnot i am sure that someth will occur to
prevent your be unit to a woman who live thousand of year ago i
am sorri to sai it but fate will interven rememb it is the god
of her peopl that i suppos she worship and i mai add to which the
whole world bow
at hi word a kind of chill fell upon me i think he saw or divin it
for after a few remark upon some indiffer matter he turn and went
awai
shortli after thi yva came to sit with me she studi me for a while
and i studi her i had reason to do so for i observ that of late
her dress had becom much more modern and on the present occas
thi struck me forcibl i do not know exactli in what the chang or
chang consist becaus i am not skill in such matter and can
onli judg of a woman garment by their gener effect at ani rate
the gorgeou sweep robe were gone and though her attir still
look foreign and somewhat orient with a touch of barbar splendour
about itit wa simpler than it had been and show more of her figur
which wa delic yet graciou
you have chang your robe ladi i said ye humphrei bastin gave
me pictur of those your women wear on further investig i found
that thi refer to an old copi of the queen newspap which somehow
or other had been brought with the book from the ship i have tri
to copi them a littl she ad doubtfulli
how do you do it where do you get the materi i ask
oh she answer with an airi wave of her hand i make itit is
there
i dont understand i said but she onli smile radiantli offer no
further explan then befor i could pursu the subject she ask
me suddenli
what ha bicklei been sai to you about me i fenc answer
i dont know bastin and bicklei talk of littl els you seem to have
been a great deal with them while i wa ill
ye a great deal thei ar the nearest to you who were so sick is it
not so
i dont know i answer again in my ill it seem to me that
you were the nearest
about bastin word i can guess she went on but i ask againwhat
ha bicklei been sai to you about me of the first part let it be
tell me the rest
i intend to evad her question but she fix those violet compel
ey upon me and i wa oblig to answer
i believ you know as well as i do i said but if you will have it
it wa that you ar not as other human women ar and that he who would
treat you as such must suffer that wa the gist of it
some might be content to suffer for such as i she answer with quiet
sweet even bastin and bicklei mai be content to suffer in their
own littl wai
you know that is not what i meant i interrupt angrili for i felt
that she wa throw reflect on me
no you meant that you agre with bicklei that i am not quit a woman
as you know women
i wa silent for her word were true
then she blaze out into on of her flash of splendour like someth
that take fire on an instant like the faint and distant star which
flame into sudden glori befor the watcher telescop
it is true that i am not as your women areyour poor pale women
the shadow of an hour with night behind them and befor becaus i am
humbl and patient do you therefor suppos that i am not great man
from the littl countri across the sea i live when the world wa
young and gather up the ancient wisdom of a greater race than your
and when the world is old i think that i still shall live though not in
thi shape or here with all that wisdom essenc burn in my breast
and with all beauti in my ey bicklei doe not believ although he
worship you onli half believ and do not worship becaus memori hold
you back and i myself do not understand i onli know though know
so much still i seek road to learn even the humbl road call
bastin that yet mai lead my feet to the gate of an immort citi
nor do i understand how all thi can be yva i said feebli for she
dazzl and overwhelm me with her blaze of power
no you do not understand how can you when even i cannot thu for
two hundr and fifti thousand year i slept and thei went by as a
lightn flash on moment my father gave me the draught and i laid me
down the next i awok with you bend over me or so it seem yet
where wa i through all those centuri when for me time had ceas
tell me humphrei did you dream at all while you were ill i ask
becaus down in that lone cavern where i sleep a strang dream came to
me on night it wa of a journei which as i thought you and i seem
to make togeth past sun and univers to a veri distant earth it
meant noth humphrei if you and i chanc to have dream the same
thing it wa onli becaus my dream travel to you it is most common
or us to be humphrei bicklei is quit right i am not altogeth
as your women ar and i can bring no happi to ani man or at the
least to on who cannot wait therefor perhap you would do well to
think less of me as i have counsel bastin and bicklei
then again she gaze at me with her wonder great ey and shake
her glitter head a littl smile and went
but oh that smile drew my heart after her
chapter xx oro and arbuthnot travel by night
as time went on oro began to visit me more and more frequent till at
last scarc a night went by that he did not appear mysteri in my
sleepingplac the odd thing wa that neither bicklei nor bastin seem
to be awar of these nocturn call inde when i mention them on
on or two occas thei stare at me and said it wa strang that he
should have come and gone as thei saw noth of him
on my speak again of the matter bicklei at onc turn the
convers from which i gather that he believ me to be suffer
from delus consequ on my ill or perhap to have taken
to dream thi wa not wonder sinc as i learn afterward
bicklei after he wa sure that i wa asleep made a practic of ty
a thread across my doorwai and of ascertain at the dawn that it
remain unbroken but oro wa not to be caught in that wai i suppos
as it wa imposs for him to pass through the latticework of the open
side of the hous that he undid the thread and fasten it again when
he left at least that wa bastin explan or rather on of
them anoth wa that he crawl beneath it but thi i could not
believ i am quit certain that dure all hi prolong exist oro
never crawl
at ani rate he came or seem to come and pump mei can us no
other wordmost energet as to exist condit in the
world especi those of the civilis countri their method of
govern their social state the physic characterist of the
variou race their religion the exact degre of civilis that
thei had develop their attain in art scienc and literatur
their martial capac their law and i know not what besid
i told him all i could but did not in the least seem to satisfi hi
perenni thirst for inform
i should prefer to judg for myself he said at last why ar you so
anxiou to learn about all these nation oro i ask exhaust
becaus the knowledg i gather mai affect my plan for the futur he
repli darkli
i am told oro that your peopl acquir the power of transport
themselv from place to place
it is true that the lord of the son of wisdom had such power and
that i have it still o humphrei
then why do you not go to look with your own ey i suggest
becaus i should need a guid on who could explain much in a short
time he said contempl me with hi burn glanc until i began
to feel uncomfort
to chang the subject i ask him whether he had ani further inform
about the war which he had told me wa rage in europ
he answer not much onli that it wa go on with vari success
and would continu to do so until the nation involv therein were
exhaust or so he believ the war did not seem greatli to interest
oro it wa he remark but a small affair compar to those which he
had known in the old dai then he depart and i went to sleep
next night he appear again and after talk a littl on differ
subject remark quietli that he had been think over what i had
said as to hi visit the modern world and intend to act upon the
suggest
when i ask

i grew alarm and suggest that bastin or bicklei would be a much
better companion than i should in my present weak state

oclock so far as i can judg by the sun for my watch is veri errat
now ever sinc bicklei tri to clean it

thought i wa in londonin fact i could swear that i have been there
then interrupt bicklei who had follow bastin into the hut
give me that doubt glanc with which i wa now familiar i wish to

danger to me
there is no danger if you ar obedi humphrei

what the ladi yva call the fourth dimens so that our bodi
pass over the sea and through mountain like the vibrat of our
wireless of which i wa speak to you
no humphrei that method is good and easi but i do not us it becaus
if i did we should be visibl in the place which we visit sinc there
all the atom that make a man would collect togeth again and be a
man
what then do you do i ask exasper
man humphrei is not on he is mani thu amongst other thing he
ha a doubl which can see and hear as he can in the flesh if it is
separ from the flesh
the old egyptian believ that i said
did thei doubtless thei inherit the knowledg from us the son of
wisdom the cup of our learn wa so full that keep it secret as we
would from time to time some of it overflow among the vulgar and
doubtless thu the light of our knowledg still burn feebli in the
world
i reflect to myself that whatev might be their other
characterist the son of wisdom had lost that of modesti but i onli
ask how he us hi doubl suppos that it exist
veri easili he answer in sleep it can be drawn from the bodi and
sent upon it mission by on that is it master
then while you were asleep for all those thousand of year your doubl
must have made mani journei
perhap he repli quietli and my spirit also which is anoth
part of me that mai have dwelt in the bodi of other men but
unhappili if so i forget and that is why i have so much to learn and
must even make us of such poor instrument as you humphrei
then if i sleep and you distil my doubl out of me i suppos that you
sleep too in that case who distil your doubl out of you lord oro
he grew angri and answer
ask no more question blind and ignor as you ar it is your part
not to examin but to obei sleep now and again he wave hi hand
over me
in an instant as it seem we were stand in a grei old town that i
judg from it appear must be either in northern franc or belgium
it wa much shatter by bombard the church for instanc wa a
ruin also mani of the hous had been burnt now howev no fire

we came to the marketplac it wa crowd with german troop also
with a great number of the inhabit of the town most of them elderli
men and women with children who had fallen into their power the
german under the command of offic were drag the men from
the arm of their wive and children to on side and with riflebutt
beat back the scream women among the men i notic two or three
priest who were do their best to sooth their companion and even
give them absolut in hurri whisper
at length the separ wa effect whereon at a hoars word of
command a compani of soldier began to fire at the men and continu
do so until all had fallen then petti offic went among the
slaughter and with pistol blew out the brain of ani who still move
these butcher you sai ar german ask oro of me
ye i answer sick with horror for though i wa in the mind and
not in the bodi i could feel as the mind doe had i been in the bodi
also i should have faint
then we need not wast time in visit their countri it is enough
let us go on
we pass out into the open land and came to a villag it wa in the
occup of german cavalri two of them held a littl girl of nine
or ten on by her bodi the other by her right hand an offic stood
between them with a drawn sword front the terrifi child he wa
a horribl coarsefac man who look to me as though he had been

ill teach the young devil to show us the wrong road and let those
french swine escap he shout and struck with the sword the girl
right hand fell to the ground
war as practis by the german remark oro then he step or
seem to step up to the man and whisper or seem to whisper in hi
ear
i do not know what tongu or what spirit speech he us or what he
said but the bloatedfac brute turn pale ye he drew sick with
fear
i think there ar spirit in thi place he said with a german oath
i could have sworn that someth told me that i wa go to die
mount
the uhlan mount and began to ride awai
watch said oro
as he spoke out of a dark cloud appear an aeroplan it pilot saw the
band of german beneath and drop a bomb the aim wa good for the
missil explod in the midst of them caus a great cloud of dust
from which aros the scream of men and hors

we were there out of the cloud of dust appear on man gallop
furious he wa a young fellow who as i note had turn hi head
awai and hidden hi ey with hi hand when the horror wa done yonder
all the other were dead except the offic who had work the deed he
wa still live but both hi hand and on of hi feet had been blown
awai present he di scream to god for merci
we pass on and came to a barn with wide door that swung a littl in
the wind caus the rust hing to scream like a creatur in pain
on each of these door hung a dead man crucifi the hat of on of
them lai upon the ground and i knew from the shape of it that he wa a
coloni soldier
did you not tell me said oro after survei them that these
german ar of your christian faith

ah he said i am glad that i worship fate bastin the priest need
troubl me no more

understand the manner of it work fate is enough for me
we went on and came to a flat countri that wa line with ditch all
of them full of men german on on side english and french upon the
other a terribl bombard shook the earth the shell rain upon
the ditch present that from the english gun ceas and out of the

and the soldier who work the spit maxim gun in twenti minut
it wa over those line of trench were taken and onc more from
either side the gun began to boom
war again said oro clean honest war such as the god i call fate
decre for man i have seen enough now i would visit those whom you
call turk i understand thei have anoth worship and perhap thei ar
nobler than these christian
we came to a hilli countri which i recognis as armenia for onc i
travel there and stop on an seashor here were the turk in
thousand thei were engag in drive befor them mob of men women
and children in countless number on and on thei drove them till
thei reach the shore there thei massacr them with bayonet with
bullet or by drown i rememb a dread scene of a poor woman
stand up to her waist in the water three children were cling to
herbut i cannot go on realli i cannot go on in the end a turk wade
out and bayonet her while she strove to protect the last live child
with her poor bodi whenc it sprang
these i understand said oro point to the turkish soldier
worship a prophet who thei sai is the voic of god
ye i answer and therefor thei massacr these who ar christian
becaus thei worship god without a prophet
and what do the christian massacr each other for
power and the wealth and territori that ar power that is the king
of the german wish to rule the world but the other nation do not
desir hi dominion therefor thei fight for liberti and justic
as it wa so it is and shall be remark oro onli with thi
differ in the old world some were wise but here and he stop
hi ey fix upon the armenian woman struggl in her death agoni
while the murder drown her child then ad let us go
our road ran across the sea on it we saw a ship so larg that it
attract oro attent and for onc he express astonish
in my dai he said we had no vessel of thi great in the world
i wish to look upon it
we land on the deck of the ship or rather the float palac and
examin her she carri mani passeng some english some american
and i point out to oro the differ between the two peopl these
were not he remark veri wide except that the american women wore
more jewel also that some of the american men to whom we listen
as thei convers spoke of the great of their countri wherea
the englishmen if thei said anyth concern it belittl their
countri
present on the surfac of the sea at a littl distanc appear
someth strang a small and omin object like a can on the top of a
pole a voic cri out submarin and everyon near rush to look
if those german try ani of their monkei trick on us i guess the
unit state will give them hell said anoth voic near by
then from the direct of the pole with the tin can on the top of
it came someth which caus a disturb in the smooth water and
bubbl to rise in it wake
a torpedo cri some
shut your mouth said the voic who dare torpedo a vessel full of
the citizen of the unit state
next came a boom crash and a flood of upthrown water in the wash of
which that speaker wa carri awai into the deep then horror horror
horror indescrib as the mighti vessel went wallow to her doom
boat launch boat overset boat drag under by her rush through
the water which could not be stai madden men and women run
to and fro their ey start from their head clasp children
fasten lifebelt over their costli gown or appear from their
cabin their hand fill with jewel that thei sought to save order
cri from high place by sternfac offic do their duti to the
last and a littl wai off that thin pole with a tin can on the top of
it watch it work
then the plung of the enorm ship into the deep it huge screw
still whirl in the air and the boom of the burst boiler lastli
everyth gone save a few boat float on the quiet sea and around
them dot that were the head of struggl human be
let us go home said oro i grow tire of thi war of your christian
peopl it is no better than that of the barbarian nation of the earli
world inde it is wors sinc then we worship fate and but a few
of us had wisdom now you all claim wisdom and declar that you worship
a god of merci
with these word still ring in my ear i woke up upon the island of
orofena fill with terror at the horribl possibl of nightmar
what els could it be there wa the brown and ancient cone of the
extinct volcano there were the tall palm of the main island and the
lake glitter in the sunlight between there wa bastin conduct
a kind of sundai school of orofenan upon the point of the rock of
offer as now he had obtain the leav of oro to do there wa the
mouth of the cave and issu from it bicklei who by help of on of
the hurrican lamp had been make an examin of the buri
remain of what he suppos to be fly machin without doubt it wa
nightmar and i would sai noth to them about it for fear of mockeri
yet two night later oro came again and after the usual preliminari
said
humphrei thi night we will visit that mighti american nation of
which you have told me so much and the other neutral countri
at thi point there is a gap in mr arbuthnot ms so oro
reflect on the neutral nation if ani remain unrecord it
continu
on our homeward wai we pass over australia make a detour to do so
of the citi oro took no account he said that thei were too larg and
too mani but the countri interest him so much that i gather he must
have given great attent to agricultur at some time in the past he
point out to me that the climat wa fine and the land so fertil
that with a proper system of irrig and waterstorag it could
support ten of million and feed not onli itself but a great part of
the outli world
but where ar the peopl he ask outsid of those huge hive and
he indic the great citi i see few of them though doubtless some
of the men ar fight in thi war well in the dai to come thi must
be remedi
over new zealand which he found beauti he shook hi head for the
same reason
on anoth night we visit the east china with it teem million
interest him extrem partli becaus he declar these to be the
descend of on of the barbarian nation of hi own dai he made
a remark to the effect that thi race had alwai possess point
and capac and that he thought that with proper govern and
instruct their chines offspr would be of us in a regener
world
for the japanes and all that thei had done in two short gener he
went so far as to express real admir a veri rare thing with oro
who wa by natur critic i could see that mental he put a white
mark against their name
india too realli move him he admir the ancient build at delhi
and agra especi the taj mahal thi he declar wa reminisc
of some of the palac that stood at pani the capit citi of the son
of wisdom befor it wa destroi by the barbarian
the english administr of the countri also attract a word of
prais from him i think becaus of it rather autocrat charact
inde he went so far as to declar that with certain modif
it should be continu in the futur and even to intim that he would
bear the matter in mind democrat form of govern had no charm
for oro
amongst other place we stop at benar and watch the funer
rite in progress upon the bank of the holi gang the bearer of the
dead brought the bodi of a woman wrap in a red shroud that glitter
with tinsel ornament come forward at a run and chant as thei ran
thei place it upon the stone for a littl while then lift it up
again and carri it down the step to the edg of the river here thei
took water and pour it over the corps thu perform the rite of
the baptism of death thi done thei place it feet in the water
and left it look veri small and lone present appear a tall
whitedrap woman who took her stand by the bodi and wail it wa the
dead on mother again the bearer approach and laid the corps upon
the flame pyre
these rite ar ancient said oro when i rule as king of the world
thei were practis in thi veri place it is pleasant to me to find
someth that ha surviv the chang of time let it continu
till the end
here i will ceas these experi that i have record ar but
sampl for also we visit russia and other countri perhap too
thei were not experi at all but onli dream consequ on my state
of health i cannot sai for certain though much of what i seem to
see fit in veri well inde with what i learn in after dai and
certainli at the time thei appear as real as though oro and i had
stood togeth upon those variou shore
chapter xxi love etern altar
now of all these happen i said veri littl to bastin and bicklei
the former would not have understood them and the latter attribut
what i did tell him to mental delus follow on my ill to yva
i did speak about them howev implor her to explain their origin
and to tell me whether or not thei were but vision of the night
she listen to me as i thought not without anxieti from which i
gather that she too fear for my mind it wa not so howev for
she said
i am glad o humphrei that your journei ar done sinc such
thing ar not without danger he who travel far out of the bodi mai
chanc to return there no more
but were thei journei or dream i ask
she evad a direct answer
i cannot sai my father ha great power i do not know them all it is
possibl that thei were neither journei nor dream mayhap he us
you as the sorcer in the old dai us the magic glass and after
he had put hi spell upon you read in your mind that which pass
elsewher
i understood her to refer to what we call clairvoy when the person
entranc reveal secret or distant thing to the entranc thi is
a more or less establish phenomenon and much less marvel than the
actual transport of the spiritu self through space onli i never
knew of an instanc in which the seer on awak rememb the thing
that he had seen as in my case there howev the matter rest or
rest for i could extract noth more from yva who appear to me to
have her order on the point
nor did oro ever talk of what i had seem to see in hi compani
although he continu from time to time to visit me at night but now
our convers wa of other matter as bastin had discov by some
extraordinari gift he had soon learn how to read the english languag
although he never spoke a singl word in that tongu among our
refer book that we brought from the yacht wa a thin paper edit
of the encyclopedia britannica which he borrow when he discov
that it contain compress inform about the variou countri of
the world also concern almost everi other matter my belief is
that within a month or so that marvel old man not onli read thi
stupend work from end to end but that he rememb everyth of
interest which it contain at least he would appear and show the
fullest acquaint with certain subject or place seek further
light from me concern them which veri often i wa quit unabl to
give him
an accid as it chanc whereof i need not set out the detail
caus me to discov that hi remark knowledg wa limit thu
at on period he knew littl about ani modern topic which began with a
letter later in the alphabet than let us sai c a few dai afterward
he wa acquaint with those up to f or g and so on till he reach z
when he appear to me to know everyth and return the book now
inde he wa a monument of learn veri ancient and veri new and
with some encyclopediagarn fact or deduct of what had happen
between
moreov he took to astronom research for more than onc we saw
him stand on the rock at night studi the heaven on on of these
occas when he had the two metal plate of which i have spoken in
hi hand i ventur to approach and ask what he did he repli that
he wa check hi calcul that he found to be quit correct
an exact period of two hundr and fifti thousand year have gone
by sinc he laid himself down to sleep then by aid of the plate
he point out to me certain alter that had happen dure that
period in the posit of some of the star
for instanc he show me on which by help of my glass i
recognis as siriu and remark that two hundr and fifti thousand
year ago it wa further awai and much smaller now it wa precis in
the place and of the size which he had predict and he point to it
on hi prophet map again he indic a star that the nightglass
told me wa capella which i suppos is on of the most brilliant
star in the sky and show me that on the map he had made two hundr
and fifti thousand year ago it did not exist as then it wa too far
north to appear thereon still he observ the passag of thi vast
period of time had produc but littl effect upon the face of the
heaven to the human ey the major of the star had not move so
veri far
and yet thei travel fast o humphrei he said consid then how
great is their journei between the time thei gather and that dai when
wornout onc more thei melt to vapor ga you think me longliv
who compar to them exist but a tini fraction of a second nearli all
of which i have been doom to pass in sleep and humphrei i desir
to livei who have great plan and would shake the world but my
dai draw in a few brief centuri and i shall be gone andwhith
whither
if you live as long as those star the end would be the same oro
ye but the life of the star is veri long million of million
of year also after death thei reform as other star but shall i
reform as anoth oro with all my wisdom i do not know it is known
to fate onlyfateth master of world and men and the god thei
worshipf whom it mai pleas to spill my gather knowledg to be
lost in the sand of time
it seem that you ar great i said and have live long and learn
much yet the end of it is that your lot is neither wors nor better
than that of us creatur of an hour
it is so humphrei present you will die and within a few centuri
i shall die also and be as you ar you believ that you will live again
etern it mai be so becaus you do believ sinc fate allow faith
to shape the futur if onli for a littl while but in me wisdom ha
destroi faith and therefor i must die even if i sleep again for
ten of thousand of year what will it help me see that sleep is
unconsci and that i shall onli wake again to die sinc sleep
doe not restor to us our youth
he ceas and walk up and down the rock with a troubl mien then he
stood in front of me and said in a triumphant voic
at least while i live i will rule and then let come what mai come i
know that you do not believ and the first victori of thi new dai of
mine shall be to make you believ i have great power and you shall
see them at work and afterward if thing go right rule with me for a
littl while perhap as the first of my subject hearken now in on
small matter my calcul made so long ago have gone wrong thei
show me that at thi time a dai of earthquak such as those that
again and again have rock and split the world would recur but now
it seem that there is an error a tini error of eleven hundr year
which must go by befor those earthquak come
ar you sure i suggest humbl that there is not also an error in
those starmap you hold
i am sure humphrei some dai who know you mai return to your world
of modern men who i gather have knowledg of the great scienc of
astronomi take now these map with which i have done and submit them
to the most learn of those men and let them tell you whether i wa
right or wrong in what i wrote upon thi metal two hundr and fifti
thousand year ago whatev els is fals at least the star in their
motion can never die
then he hand me the map and wa gone i have them todai and if ever
thi book is publish thei will appear with it that those who ar
qualifi mai judg of them and of the truth or otherwis of oro
word
from that night forward for quit a long time i saw oro no more nor
inde did ani of us sinc for some reason of hi own he forbad us to
visit the under ground citi of nyo oddli enough howev he command
yva to bring down the spaniel tommi to be with him from time to time
when i ask her why she said it wa becaus he wa lone and
desir the dog companionship it seem to us veri strang that thi
superman who had the wisdom of ten solomon gather in on within hi
breast should yet desir the compani of a littl dog what then wa the
worth of learn and long life or inde of anyth well solomon
himself ask the question ag sinc and could give no answer save
that all is vaniti
i note about thi time that yva began to grow veri sad and troubl
inde look at her suddenli on two or three occas i saw that
her beauti ey were aswim with tear also i note that alwai as
she grew sadder she becam in a sens more human in the begin she
wa as it were far awai on could never forget that she wa the
child of some alien race whose ey had look upon the world when by
comparison human wa young at time inde she might have been
the denizen of anoth planet strai to earth although she never
flaunt it on felt that her simplest word hid secret wisdom that
to her book were open in which we could not read moreov as i have
said occasion power flame out of her power that wa beyond our
ken and understand
yet with all thi there wa noth elfish about her noth
uncanni she wa alwai kind and as we could feel innat good and
gentleheart just a woman made halfdivin by gift and experi
that other lack she did not even make us of her wondrou beauti to
madden men as she might well have done had she been so mind it is
true that both bastin and bicklei fell in love with her but that wa
onli becaus all with whom she had to do must love her and then when
she told them that it might not be it wa in such a fashion that no
sore wa left behind thei went on love her that wa all but as
men love their sister or their daughter as we conceiv that thei mai
love in that land where there is no marri or give in marriag
but now in her sad she drew ever nearer to us and especi to
myself more in tune with our ag and thought in truth save for her
royal and glitter loveli in which there wa some qualiti which
proclaim her of anoth blood and for that reserv of hidden power
which at time would look out of her ey or break through her word
she might in most wai have been some singularli gift and beauti
modern woman
the time ha come when i must speak of my relat with yva and of
their climax as mai have been guess from the first i began to love
her while the week went on that love grew and grew until it utterli
possess me although for a certain reason connect with on dead at
first i fought against it yet it did not develop quit in the fashion
that might have been expect there wa no blaze up of passion
fire rather wa there an everincreas glow of the holiest affect
till at last it becam a lamp by which i must guid my feet through life
and death thi love of mine seem not of earth but from the star as
yet i had said noth to her of it becaus in some wai i felt that she
did not wish me to do so felt also that she wa well awar of all that
pass within my heart and desir as it were to give it time to
ripen there then on dai there came a chang and though no glanc or
touch of yva told me so i knew that the bar were taken down and that
i might speak
it wa a night of full moon all that afternoon she had been talk to
bastin apart i suppos about religion for i saw that he had some book
in hi hand from which he wa expound someth to her in hi slow
earnest wai then she came and sat with us while we took our even
meal i rememb that mine consist of some of the lifewat which
she had brought with her and fruit for as i think i have said i had
acquir her dislik to meat also that she at some plantain throw
the skin for tommi to fetch and laugh at hi plai when it wa over
bastin and bicklei went awai togeth whether by chanc or design i do
not know and she said to me suddenli
humphrei you have often ask me about the citi pani of which a
littl portion of the ruin remain upon thi island the rest be
buri beneath the water if you wish i will show you where our royal
palac wa befor the barbarian destroi it with their airship the
moon is veri bright and by it we can see
i nod for know what she meant somehow i could not answer her
and we began the ascent of the hill she explain to me the plan of the
palac when we reach the ruin show me where her own apart
had been and the rest it wa veri strang to hear her quietli tell
of build which had stood and of thing that had happen over two
hundr and fifti thousand year befor much as ani modern ladi might
do of a hous that had been destroi a month ago by an earthquak or a
zeppelin bomb while she describ the detail of a disast which now
frighten her no more i think it wa then that for the first time i
realli began to believ that in fact yva had live all those aeon sinc
and been as she still appear
we pass from the palac to the ruin of the templ through what
as she said had been a pleasuregarden point out where a certain
avenu of rare palm had grown down which onc it wa her habit to walk
in the cool of the dai or rather there were two terrac templ
on dedic to fate like that in the underground citi of nyo and the
other to love of the templ to fate she told me her father had been the
high priest and of the templ to love she wa the high priestess
then it wa that i understood why she had brought me here
she led the wai to a marbl block cover with wornout carv and
almost buri in the debri thi she said wa the altar of offer
i ask her what offer and she repli with a smile
onli wine to signifi the spirit of life and flower to symbolis
it fragranc and she laid her finger on a cuplik depress still
appar in the marbl into which the wine wa pour
inde i gather that there wa noth coars or bacchanalian about
thi worship of a prototyp of aphrodit on the contrari that it wa
more or less spiritu and ether we sat down on the altar stone i
wonder a littl that she should have done so but she read my thought
and answer
sometim we chang our faith humphrei or perhap thei grow also
have i not told you that sacrific were offer on thi altar and she
sigh and smile
i do not know which wa the sweeter the smile or the sigh
we look at the water glimmer in the crater beneath us on the edg
of which we sat we look at heaven abov in which the great moon
sail royal then we look into each other ey
i love you i said
i know it she answer gentli you have love me from the first
have you not even when i lai asleep in the coffin you began to love me
but until you dream a certain dream you would not admit it
yva what wa the mean of that dream
i cannot sai humphrei but i tell you thi as you will learn in time
on spirit mai be cloth in differ garment of the flesh
i did not understand her but in some strang wai her word brought to
my mind those that natali spoke at the last and i answer
yva when my wife lai dy she bade me seek her elsewher for
certainli i should find her doubtless she meant beyond the shore of
deathor perhap she also dream
she bent her head look at me veri strang
your wife too mai have had the gift of dream humphrei as you dream
and i dream so mayhap she dream of dream then let us sai no more
sinc i think that thei have serv their purpos and all three of us
understand
then i stretch out my arm and next instant my head lai upon her
perfum breast she lift it and kiss me on the lip sai
with thi kiss again i give myself to you but oh humphrei do not ask
too much of the god of my peopl fate and she look me in the ey
and sigh
what do you mean i ask trembl
mani mani thing among them that happi is not for mortal and
rememb that though my life began long ago i am mortal as you ar and
that in etern time make no differ
and if so yva what then do we meet but to part
who said it not i humphrei i tell you thi nor earth nor heaven
nor hell have ani bar through which love cannot burst it wai toward
reunion and complet onli there must be love manifest in mani
shape and at mani time but ever strive to it end which is not of
the flesh ay love that ha lost itself love scorn love defeat
love that seem fals love betrai love gone astrai love wander
through the world love asleep and live in it sleep love awak and
yet sleep all love that ha in it the germ of life it matter not
what form love take if it be true i tell you that it will win it
wai and in the mani that it ha seem to worship still find the on
though perchanc not here
at her word a numb fear grip my heart
not here then where i said
ask your dead wife humphrei ask the dumb star ask the god you
worship for i cannot answer save in on wordsomewher man be not
afraid do you think that such as you and i can be lost in the ach
abysm of space i know but littl yet i tell you that we ar it
ruler i tell you that we too ar god if onli we can aspir and
believ for the doubt and timid there is naught for those who see
with the ey of the soul and stretch out their hand to grasp there is
all even bastin will tell you thi
but i said life is short those world ar far awai and you ar
near
she becam wonder mysteri
near i am far she said and far i am near if onli thi love of
your is strong enough to follow and to clasp and humphrei it need
strength for here i am afraid that it will bear littl of such fruit as
men desir to pluck
again terror took hold of me and i look at her for i did not know
what to sai or ask
listen she went on alreadi my father ha offer me to you in
marriag ha he not but at a price which you do not understand
believ me it is on that you should never pai sinc the rule of the
world can be too dearli bought by the slaughter of half the world and
if you would pai it i cannot
but thi is mad i exclaim your father ha no power over our
earth
i would that i could think so humphrei i tell you that he ha power
and that it is hi purpos to us them as he ha done befor you too
he would us and me
and if so yva we ar lord of ourselv let us take each other
while we mai bastin is a priest
lord of ourselv why for ought i know at thi veri moment oro
watch us in hi thought and laugh onli in death humphrei shall we
pass beyond hi reach and becom lord of ourselv
it is monstrou i cri there is the boat let us fly awai
what boat can bear us out of stretch of the arm of the old god of my
peopl fate whereof oro is the high priest nai here we must wait our
doom
doom i saiddoom what then is about to happen
a terribl thing as i think humphrei or rather it will not
happen
why not if it must
belov she whisper bastin ha expound to me a new faith
whereof the masterword is sacrific the terribl thing will not happen
becaus of sacrific ask me no more
she muse a while seat there in the moonlight upon the ancient altar
of sacrific the veil she wore fall about her face and make
her mysteri then she threw it back show her love ey and
glitter hair and laugh
we have still an earthli hour she said therefor let us forget the
far dead past and the etern to come and be joy in that hour
now throw your arm about me and i will tell you strang stori of lost
dai and you shall look into my ey and learn wisdom and you shall
kiss my lip and tast of blissyou who were and ar and shall
beyou the belov of yva from the begin to the end of time
chapter xxii the command
i think that both bastin and bicklei by instinct as it were knew what
had pass between yva and myself and that she had promis herself to
me thei show thi by the wai in which thei avoid ani mention of
her name also thei began to talk of their own plan for the futur
as matter in which i had no part thu i heard them discuss the
possibl of escap from the island whereof suddenli thei seem to
have grown weari and whether by ani mean two men two not three
could manag to sail and steer the lifeboat that remain upon the
wreck in short as in all such case the woman had come between also
the pressur of a common loss caus them to forget their differ
and to draw closer togeth i who had succeed where thei both had
fail wa thei seem to think out of their live so much that our
ancient intimaci had end
thi attitud hurt me perhap becaus in mani respect the situat
wa awkward thei had it is true taken their failur extrem well
still the fact remain that both of them had fallen in love with the
wonder creatur woman and yet more than woman who had bound
herself to me how then could we go on live togeth i in prospect
possess of the object that all had desir and thei without the
pale
moreov thei were jealou in anoth and quit a differ fashion
becaus thei both love me in their own wai and were convinc that i
who had hitherto love them henceforward should have no affect left
to spare sinc sure thi glitter ladi thi marvel of wisdom and
physic perfect would take it all of cours thei were in error
sinc even if i could have been so base and selfish thi wa no conduct
that yva would have wish or even suffer still that wa their
thought
master the situat i reflect a littl while and then spoke
straight out to them
my friend i said as i see that you have guess yva and i ar
affianc to each other and love each other perfectli
ye arbuthnot said bastin we saw that in your face and in her
as she bade us good night befor she went into the cave and we
congratul you and wish you everi happi
we wish you everi happi old fellow chime in bicklei he
paus a while then ad but to be honest i am not sure that i
congratul you
why not bicklei
not for the reason that you mai suspect arbuthnot i mean not becaus
you have won where we have lost as it wa onli to be expect that you
would do but on account of someth total differ i told you
a while ago and repetit is useless and pain i need onli add
therefor that sinc then my convict ha strengthen and i am
sure sorri as i am to sai it that in thi matter you must prepar for
disappoint and calam that woman if woman she realli is will
never be the wife of mortal man now be angri with me if you like or
laugh as you have the right to do see that like bastin and yourself
i also ask her to marri me but someth make me speak what i
believ to be the truth
like cassandra i suggest
ye like cassandra who wa not a popular person at first i wa
inclin to resent bicklei wordswho would not have been in the
circumst then of a sudden there rush in upon my mind the
convict that he spoke the truth in thi world yva wa not for me or
ani man moreov she knew it the knowledg peep out of everi word
she spoke in our passion love scene by the lake she wa awar and
subconsci i wa awar that we were plight our troth not for
time but for etern with time we had littl left to do not for long
would she wear the ring i gave her on that holi night
even bastin whose percept normal were not acut felt that the
situat wa strain and awkward and broke in with a curiou air of
forc satisfact
it uncommonli lucki for you old boi that you happen to have
a clergyman in your parti as i shall be abl to marri you in a
respect fashion of cours i cant sai that the glitter ladi is
as yet absolut convert to our faith but i am certain that she
ha absorb enough of it principl to justifi me in unit her in
christian wedlock
ye i answer she ha absorb it principl she told me as
much herself sacrific for instanc and as i spoke the word my ey
fill with tear
sacrific broke in bicklei with an angri snort for he need a vent
to hi mental disturb rubbish why should everi religion demand
sacrific as savag do by it alon thei stand condemn
becaus as i think sacrific is the law of life at least of all life
that is worth the live i answer sadli enough anyhow i believ
you ar right bicklei and that bastin will not be troubl to marri
us
you dont mean broke in bastin with a horrifi air that you
propos to dispens
no bastin i dont mean that what i mean is that it come upon me
that someth will prevent thi marriag sacrific perhap though in
what shape i do not know and now good night i am tire
that night in the chill dead hour befor the dawn oro came again i
woke up to see him seat by my bed majest and as it seem to me
lambent though thi mai have been my imagin
you take strang liberti with my daughter barbarian or she
take strang liberti with you it doe not matter which he said
regard me with hi calm and terribl ey
why do you presum to call me barbarian i ask avoid the main
issu
for thi reason humphrei all men ar the same thei have the same
organ the same instinct the same desir which in essenc ar
but two food and rebirth that natur command though it is true that
million of year befor i wa born as i have learn from the record
of the son of wisdom it wa said that thei were half ap yet be
the same there is between them a whole sea of differ sinc some
have knowledg and other none or littl those who have none or
littl among whom you must be number ar barbarian those who
have much among whom my daughter and i ar the sole survivor ar the
instruct
there ar nearli two thousand million of live peopl in thi world
i said and you name all of them barbarian
all humphrei except of cours myself and my daughter who ar
not known to be aliv you think that you have learn much wherea in
truth you ar most ignor the commonest of the outer nation when i
destroi them knew more than your wisest know todai
you ar mistaken oro sinc then we have learn someth of the
soul
ah he exclaim that interest me and perhap it is true also if
true it is veri import as i have told you beforeor wa it bastin
if a man ha a soul he live wherea even we son of wisdom die and
in death what is the us of wisdom becaus you can believ you have
soul and ar therefor perhap heir to life foolish and ignor as
you ar todai therefor i admit you and bastin to be my equal though
bicklei who like myself believ noth is but a common chemist and
doctor of diseas
then you bow to faith oro
ye and i think that my god fate also bow to faith perhap inde
faith shape fate not fate faith but whenc come that faith which
even i with all my learn cannot command why is it deni to me and
given to you and bastin
becaus as bastin would tell you it is a gift though on that is
never grant to the proud and selfsuffici becom humbl as a
child oro and perchanc you too mai acquir faith
and how shall i becom humbl
by put awai all dream of power and it exercis if such you have
and in repent walk quietli to the gate of death i repli
for you humphrei who have littl or none of these thing that mai be
easi but for me who have much if not all it is otherwis you ask me
to abandon the certain for the uncertain the known for the unknown
and from a halfgod commun with the star to becom an earthworm
crawl in mud and lift blind ey toward the dark of
everlast night
a god who must die is no god half or whole oro the earthworm that
live on is greater than he
mayhap yet while i endur i will be as a god so that when night
come if come it must i shall have plai my part and left my mark
upon thi littl world of our have done he ad with a burst of
impati what will you of my daughter
what man ha alwai will of womanherself bodi and soul
her soul perchanc is your if she ha on but her bodi is mine to
give or withhold yet it can be bought at a price he ad slowli
so she told me oro
i can guess what she told you did i not watch you yonder by the
lake when you gave her a ring grave with the sign of life and
everlasting the question is will you pai the price
not so the question iswhat is the price
thi to enter my servic and henceforth do my willwithout debat or
cavil
for what reward oro
yva and the dominion of the earth while you shall live neither more
nor less
and what is your will
that you shall learn in due cours on the second night from thi i
command the three of you to wait upon me at sundown in the buri hall
of nyo till then you see no more of yva for i do not trust her she
too ha power though as yet she doe not us them and perchanc
she would forget her oath and follow some new star of love for a
littl while vanish with you out of my reach be in the sepulchr at the
hour of sundown on the second dai from thi all three of you if you
would continu to live upon the earth afterward you shall learn my
will and make your choic between yva with majesti and her loss with
death
then suddenli he wa gone
next morn i told the other what had pass and we talk the matter
over the troubl wa of cours that bicklei did not believ me he
had no faith in my alleg interview with oro which he set down to
delus of a semimesmer charact thi wa not strang sinc
it appear that on the previou night he had watch the door of
my sleepingplac until dawn broke which it did long after oro had
depart and he had not seen him either come or go although the moon
wa shine brightli
when he told me thi i could onli answer that all the same he had been
there as if he could speak tommi would have been abl to certifi as
it chanc the dog wa sleep with me and at the first sound of the
approach of someon woke up and growl then recognis oro he went
to him wag hi tail and curl himself up at hi feet
bastin believ my stori readili enough sai that oro wa a peculiar
person who no doubt had wai of come and go which we did not
understand hi point wa howev that he did not in the least wish to
visit nyo ani more the wonder of it underground palac and templ
had no charm for him also he did not think he could do ani good by
go sinc after suck him as dry as an orang with refer to
religi matter that old vampirebat oro had just thrown him awai
like the rind and he might add seem no better for the juic he
had absorb
i doubt continu bastin whether st paul himself could have
convert oro even if he perform miracl befor him what is the
us of show miracl to a man who could alwai work a bigger on
himself
in short bastin on idea and bicklei also for the matter of that
wa to get awai to the main island and thenc escap by mean of the
boat or in some other fashion
i point out that oro had said we must obei at the peril of our live
inde that he had put it even more strongli us word to the effect
that if we did not he would kill us
id take the risk said bicklei sinc i believ that you dreamt it
all arbuthnot howev put that asid there is a natur reason
why you should wish to go and for my own part so do i in a wai i want
to see what that old fellow ha up hi extrem long sleev if there
is anyth there at all
well if you ask me bicklei i answer i believ it is the
destruct of half the earth or some littl matter of that sort
at thi suggest bicklei onli snort but bastin said cheerfulli
i dare sai he is bad enough even for that but as i am quit convinc
that it will never be allow hi intent do not troubl me
i remark that he seem to have carri them out onc befor
oh you mean the delug well no doubt there wa a delug but i am
sure that oro had no more to do with it than you or i as i think i have
said alreadi anyhow it is imposs to leav you to descend into that
hole alon i suggest therefor that we should go into the sepulchr
at the time which you believ oro appoint and see what happen if
you ar not mistaken the glitter ladi will come there to fetch us
sinc it is quit certain that we cannot work the lift or whatev it
is alon if you ar mistaken we can just go back to bed as usual
ye that the best plan said bicklei shortli after which the
convers came to an end
all that dai and the next i watch and wait in vain for the come
of yva but no yva appear i even went as far as the sepulchr but it
wa as empti as were the two crystal coffin and after wait a while
i return although i did not sai so to bicklei to me it wa evid
that oro as he had said wa determin to cut off all commun
between us
the second dai drew to it close our simpl prepar were complet
thei consist mainli in make readi our hurrican lamp and pack
up a littl food enough to keep us for three or four dai if necessari
togeth with some match and a good suppli of oil sinc as bastin
put it he wa determin not to be caught like the foolish virgin in
the parabl
you see he ad on never know when it might pleas that old
wretch to turn off the incandesc ga or electr light or whatev
it is he us to illumin hi famili catacomb and then it would be
awkward if we had no oil
for the matter of that he might steal our lamp suggest bicklei
in which case we should be where mose wa when the light went out
i have consid that possibl answer bastin and therefor
although it is a danger weapon to carri load i am determin to
take my revolv if necessari i shall consid myself quit justifi
in shoot him to save our live and those of thousand of other
at thi we both laugh somehow the idea of bastin try to shoot oro
struck us as intens ludicr yet that veri thing wa to happen
it wa a peculiarli beauti sunset over the southern sea to the
west the great flame orb sank into the ocean to the east appear
the silver circl of the full moon to my excit fanci thei were like
scale hang from the hand of a materialis spirit of calm over the
volcano and the lake over the island with it palm tree over the sea
beyond thi calm brood save for a few travel bird the sky
wa empti no cloud disturb it peac the world seem steep in
innoc and quiet
all these thing struck me as i think thei did the other becaus by
the action of some simultan thought it came to our mind that veri
probabl we were look on them for the last time it is all veri well
to talk of the unknown and the infinit whereof we ar assur we ar
the heir but that doe not make it ani easier for us to part with the
known and the finit the contempl of the wonder of etern doe
not conceal the advantag of actual and exist time in short there
is no on of us from a saint archbishop down to a sin suicid who
doe not regret the necess of farewel to the pleasant light and the
kindli race of men wherewith we ar acquaint
for after all who can be quit certain of the beyond it mai be
splendid but it will probabl be strang and from strang after a
certain ag we shrink we know that all thing will be differ there
that our human relationship will be utterli chang that perhap sex
which shape so mani of them will vanish to be replac by someth
unknown that ambit will lose their hold of us and that at the
best the mere loss of hope and fear will leav us empti so at least
we think who seek not variat but continu sinc the spirit must
differ from the bodi and that thought alarm our intellig
at least some of us think so other like bicklei write down
the futur as a black and endless night which after all ha it
consol sinc as ha been wise suggest perhap oblivion is
better than ani memori other again like bastin would sai of
it with the frenchman plu ca chang plu cest la meme chose yet
other like oro consid it as a realm of possibl probabl
unpleas and perhap nonexist just thi and noth more onli
on thing is certain that no creatur which ha life desir to leap
into the fire and from the dross of doubt to resolv the goldor the
leadof certainti
it is time to be go said bastin in these ski the sun seem to
tumbl down not to set decent as it doe in england and if we wait
ani longer we shall be late for our appoint in the sepulchr i am
sorri becaus although i dont often notic sceneri everyth look
rather beauti thi even that star for instanc i think it is
call venu
and therefor on that arbuthnot should admir broke in bicklei
attempt to lighten matter with a joke but come on and let us be
rid of thi fool errand certainli the world is a love place after
all and for my part i hope that we havent seen the last of it he
ad with a sigh
so do i said bastin though of cours faith teach us that there
ar much better on beyond it is no us bother about what thei ar
like but i hope that the road to them doesnt run through the hole that
the old reprob oro call nyo
a few minut later we start each of us carri hi share of the
impedimenta i think that tommi wa the onli realli cheer member
of the parti for he skip about and bark run backward and
forward into the mouth of the cave as though to hurri our movement
realli said bastin it is quit unholi to see an anim go on in
that wai when it know that it is about to descend into the bowel of
the earth i suppos it must like them
oh no comment bicklei it onli like what is in themlik
arbuthnot sinc that littl beast came in contact with the ladi yva it
ha never been happi out of her compani
i think that is so said bastin at ani rate i have notic that it
ha been mope for the last two dai as it alwai doe when she is
not present it even seem to like oro who give me the creep perhap
becaus he is her father dog must be veri charit anim
by now we were in the cave march past the wreck of the halfburi
flyingmachin which bicklei as he remark regretfulli had never
found time thoroughli to examin inde to do so would have need
more dig than we could do without proper instrument sinc the
machin were big and deepli entomb in dust
we came to the sepulchr and enter
well said bicklei seat himself on the edg of on of the coffin
and hold up hi lamp to look about him thi place seem fairli
empti no on is keep the assign arbuthnot although the sun is
well down
as he spoke the word yva stood befor us whenc she came we did not
see for all our back were turn at the moment of her arriv but
there she wa calm beauti radiat light
chapter xxiii in the templ of fate
yva glanc at me and in her ey i read tender and solicitud
also someth of inquiri it seem to me as though she were wonder
what i should do under circumst that might or would aris and in
some secret fashion of which i wa but half consciou draw an answer
from my soul then she turn and smile in her dazzl wai said
so bicklei as usual you did not believ becaus you did not see
him therefor the lord oro my father never spoke with humphrei
as though the lord oro could not pass you without your knowledg or
perchanc send thought cloth in hi own shape to work hi errand
how do you know that i did not believ arbuthnot stori bicklei
ask in a rather cross voic and avoid the direct issu do you
also send thought to work your errand cloth in your own shape ladi
yva
ala not so though perhap i could if i might it is veri simpl
bicklei stand here i heard you sai that although the sun wa well
down there wa no on to meet you as humphrei had expect and from
those word and your voic i guess the rest
your knowledg of the english languag is improv fast ladi yva
also when i spoke you were not here
at least i wa veri near bicklei and these wall ar thinner than you
think she answer contempl what seem to be solid rock with
ey that were full of innoc oh friend she went on suddenli
i wonder what there is which will caus you to believ that you do not
know all that there exist mani thing beyond the reach of your learn
and imagin well in a dai or two perhap even you will admit as
much and confess it to meelsewher and she sigh
i am readi to confess now that much happen which i do not understand
at present becaus i have not the kei to the trick he repli
yva shook her head at him and smile again then she motion to all of
us to stand close to her and stoop lift tommi in her arm next
moment that marvel happen which i have describ alreadi and we were
whirl downward through space to find ourselv in a veri littl
time stand safe in the cave of nyo breathless with the swift of
our descent how and on what we descend neither i nor the other ever
learn it wa and must remain on of the unexplain mysteri of our
great experi
whither now yva i ask stare about me at the radiant vast
the lord oro would speak with you humphrei follow and i prai you all
do not make him wrath for hi mood is not gentl
so onc more we proceed down the empti street of that underground
abod which except that it wa better illumin remind me of the
greek concept of hade we came to the sacr fountain over which
stood the guardian statu of life pour from the cup she held the
water of good and ill that mingl into on healthgiv wine
drink all of you she said for i think befor the sun set again
upon the earth we shall need strength everi on of us
so we drank and she drank herself and onc more felt the blood go
danc through our vein as though the draught had been some nectar of
the god then have extinguish the lantern which we still carri
for here thei were needless and we wish to save our oil we follow
her through the great door into the vast hall of audienc and advanc
up it between the endless empti seat at it head on the dai
beneath the arch shell sat oro on hi throne as befor he wore the
jewel cap and the gorgeou flow robe while the tabl in front
of him wa still strewn with sheet of metal on which he wrote with a
pen or stylu that glitter like a diamond or hi own fierc ey
then he lift hi head and beckon to us to ascend the dai
you ar here it is well he said which wa all hi greet onli
when tommi ran up to him he bent down and pat the dog head with hi
long thin hand and as he did so hi face soften it wa evid to
me that tommi wa more welcom to him than were the rest of us
there wa a long silenc while on by on he search us with hi
pierc glanc it rest on me the last of the three of us and from
me travel to yva
i wonder why i have sent for you he said at length with a mirthless
laugh i think it must be that i mai convinc bicklei the sceptic
that there ar power which he doe not understand but that i have the
strength to move also perhap that your live mai be spare for my
own purpos in that which is about to happen hearken my labour ar
finish my calcul ar complet and he point to the sheet of
metal befor him that were cover with cabalist sign tomorrow i am
about to do what onc befor i did and to plung half the world in the
deep of ocean and lift again from the depth that which ha been buri
for a quarter of a million year
which half ask bicklei
that is my secret physician and the answer to it li written here
in sign you cannot read certain countri will vanish other will be
spare i sai that it is my secret
then oro if you could do what you threaten you would drown hundr
of million of peopl
if i could do if i could do he exclaim glare at bicklei well
tomorrow you shall see what i can do oh why do i grow angri with thi
fool for the rest ye thei must drown what doe it matter their end
will be swift some few minut of terror that is all and in on short
centuri everi on of them would have been dead
an express of horror gather on bastin face
do you realli mean to murder hundr of million of peopl he ask
in a thick slow voic
i have said that i intend to send them to that heaven or that hell of
which you ar so fond of talk preacher somewhat more quickli
than otherwis thei would have found their wai thither thei have
disappoint me thei have fail therefor let them go and make room
for other who will succe
then you ar a greater assassin than ani that the world ha bred or
than all of them put togeth there is nobodi as bad even in the book
of revel shout bastin in a kind of furi moreov i am not
like bicklei i know enough of you and your hellish power to believ
that what you plan that you can do
i believ it also sneer oro but how come it that the great on
whom you worship doe not prevent the deed if he exist and it be
evil
he will prevent it rave bastin even now he command me to prevent
it and i obei then draw the revolv from hi pocket he point
it at oro breast ad swear not to commit thi crime or i will
kill you
so the man of peac would becom a man of blood muse oro and kill
that i mai not kill for the good of the world why what is the matter
with that toi of your preacher and he point to the pistol
well might he ask for as he spoke the revolv flew out of bastin
hand high into the air it flew and as it went discharg itself all
the six chamber of it in rapid success while bastin stood stare
at hi arm and hand which he seem unabl to withdraw
do you still threaten me with that outstretch hand preacher mock
oro
i cant move it said bastin it seem turn to stone
be thank that you also ar not turn to stone but becaus your
courag pleas me i will spare you ye and will advanc you in my
new kingdom what shall you be control of religion i think sinc
all the qualiti that a high priest should have ar yoursfaith
fanatic and folli
it is veri strang said bastin but all of a sudden my arm and hand
ar quit well again i suppos it must have been pin and needl or
someth of that sort which made me throw awai the pistol and pull the
trigger when i didnt mean to do so
then he went to fetch that articl which had fallen beyond the dai and
quit forgot hi intent of execut oro in the interest of test
it mechan which prove to be destroi to hi propos appoint
he made no illus if he comprehend what wa meant which i doubt
he took it as a joke
hearken all of you said oro lift hi head suddenli for while
bastin recov the revolv he had been brood the great thing
which i shall do tomorrow must be wit by you becaus therebi onli
can you come to understand my power also yonder where i bring it about
in the bowel of the earth you will be safer than elsewher sinc when
and perhap befor it happen the whole world will heav and shake and
trembl and i know not what mai chanc even in these cave for thi
reason also do not forget to bring the littl hound with you sinc
him least of all of you would i see come to harm perhap becaus onc
hundr of gener ago as you reckon time i had a dog veri like to
him your mother love him much yva and when she di thi dog di
also he li embalm with her on her coffin yonder in the templ and
yesterdai i went to look at both of them the beast ar wonderfulli
alik which show the everlasting of blood
he paus a while lost in thought then continu after the deed is
done ill speak with you and you shall choos stranger whether you
will die your own master or live on to serv me now there is on
problem that is left to me to solvewheth i can save a certain
landdo not ask which it is humphrei though i see the question in
your eyesor must let it go with the rest i onli answer you that
i will do my best becaus you love it so farewel for a while and
preacher be advis by me and do not aim too high again
it doesnt matter where i aim answer bastin sturdili or whether
i hit or miss sinc there is someth much bigger than me wait to
deal with you the countri that you think you ar go to destroi
will sleep quit as well tomorrow as thei do tonight oro
much better i think preacher sinc by then thei will have left
sorrow and pain and wicked and war far behind them
where ar we to go i ask
the ladi yva will show you he answer wave hi hand and onc
more bent over hi endless calcul
yva beckon to us and we turn and follow her down the hall she led
us to a street near the gatewai of the templ and thenc into on of the
hous there wa a portico to it lead to a court out of which open
room somewhat in the pompeian fashion we did not enter the room for
at the end of the court were a metal tabl and three couch also of
metal on which were spread richlook rug whenc these came i do
not know and never ask but i rememb that thei were veri beauti
and soft as velvet
here you mai sleep she said if sleep you can and eat of the food
that you have brought with you tomorrow earli i will call you when it
is time for us to start upon our journei into the bowel of the earth
i dont want to go ani deeper than we ar said bastin doubtfulli
i think that none of us want to go bastin she answer with a sigh
yet go we must i prai of you anger the lord oro no more on thi or
ani other matter in your folli you tri to kill him and as it chanc
he bore it well becaus he love courag but anoth time he mai strike
back and then bastin
i am not afraid of him he answer but i do not like tunnel
still perhap it would be better to accompani you than to be left in
thi place alon now i will unpack the food
yva turn to go
i must leav you she said sinc my father need my help the matter
ha to do with the forc that he would let loos tomorrow and it
measur also with the prepar of the robe that we must wear
lest it should harm us in it leap
someth in her ey told me that she wish me to follow her and
i did so outsid the portico where we stood in the desol light
street she halt
if you ar not afraid she said meet me at midnight by the statu of
fate in the great templ for i would speak with you humphrei where
if anywher we mai be alon
i will come yva
you know the road and the gate ar open humphrei
then she gave me her hand to kiss and glide awai i return to the
other and we at somewhat sparingli for we wish to save our food in
case of need and have drunk of the lifewat were not hungri also
we talk a littl but by common consent avoid the subject of the
morrow and what it might bring forth
we knew that terribl thing were afoot but lack ani knowledg of
what these might be thought it useless to discuss them inde we
were too depress so much so that even bastin and bicklei ceas from
argu the latter wa so overcom by the exhibit of oro power
when he caus the pistol to leap into the air and discharg itself
that he could not even pluck up courag to laugh at the failur of
bastin effort to do justic on the old superman or rather to
prevent him from attempt a coloss crime
at length we lai down on the couch to rest bastin remark that he
wish he could turn off the light also that he did not in the least
regret have tri to kill oro sleep seem to come to the other
quickli but i could onli doze to wake up from time to time of thi i
wa not sorri sinc whenev i drop off dream seem to pursu me
for the most part thei were of my dead wife she appear to be try
to consol me for some loss but the strang thing wa that sometim
she spoke with her own voic and sometim with yva and sometim
look at me with her own ey and sometim with those of yva i
rememb noth els about these dream which were veri confus
after on of them the most vivid of all i awok and look at my
watch it wa halfpast eleven almost time for me to be start the
other two seem to be fast asleep present i rose and crept down the
court without wake them outsid the portico which by the wai wa a
curiou exampl of the surviv of custom in architectur sinc none
wa need in that weatherless place i turn to the right and follow
the wide street to the templ enclosur through the pillar court
i went my footstep although i walk as softli as i could echo
loudli in that intens silenc through the great door into the utter
solitud of the vast and perfect fane
word can not tell the loneli of that place it flow over me like
a sea and seem to swallow up my be so that even the wildest and
most danger beast would have been welcom as a companion i wa as
terrifi as a child that wake to find itself desert in the dark
also an uncanni sens of terror to come oppress me till i could have
cri aloud if onli to hear the sound of a mortal voic yonder wa
the grim statu of fate the oracl of the king of the son of wisdom
which wa believ to bow it stoni head in answer to their prayer i
ran to it eager for it terribl shelter for on either side of it were
figur of human be even their cold marbl wa compani of a sort
though ala over all frown fate
let anyon imagin himself stand alon beneath the dome of st
paul in the centr of that cathedr brilliant with mysteri light
and stretch all about it a london that had been dead and absolut
unpeopl for ten of thousand of year if he can do thi he will
gather some idea of my physic state let him add to hi mindpictur
a knowledg that on the follow dai someth wa to happen not unlik
the end of the world as prognost by the book of revel and by
most astronom and he will have some idea of my mental perturb
add to the mixtur a most mystic yet veri real love affair and an
assign befor that symbol of the cold fate which seem to swai the
univers down to the tiniest detail of individu live and he mai
begin to understand what i humphrei arbuthnot experienc dure my
vigil in thi sanctuari of a vanish race
it seem long befor yva came but at last she did come i caught sight
of her far awai beyond the templ gate flit through the unholi
bright of the pillar court like a white moth at night and seem
quit as small she approach now she wa as a ghost and then draw
near chang into a live breath love woman i open my
arm and with someth like a sob she sank into them and we kiss as
mortal do
i could not come more quickli she said the lord oro need me and
those calcul were long and difficult also twice he must visit the
place whither we shall go tomorrow and that took time
then it is close at hand i said
humphrei be not foolish do you not rememb who have travel with
him that oro can throw hi soul afar and bring it back again laden with
knowledg as the feet of a bee ar laden with golden dust well he
went and went again and i must wait and then the robe and shield
thei must be prepar by hi art and mine oh ask not what thei ar
there is no time to tell and it matter noth some folk ar wise and
some ar foolish but all which matter is that within them flow the
blood of life and that life breed love and that love as i believ
although oro doe not breed immort and if so what is time but
as a grain of sand upon the shore
thi yva it is our who can count on noth els
oh humphrei if i thought that no more wretch creatur would
breath tonight upon thi great world
what do you mean i ask grow fear more at her manner and her
look than at her word
noth noth except that time is so veri short a kiss a touch
a littl light and a littl dark and it is gone ask my father oro
who ha live a thousand year and slept for ten of thousand as i
have and he will sai the same it is against time that he fight he
who believ in noth beyond will inherit noth as bastin
sai he to whom time ha brought noth save a pass bloodstain
great and triumph end in dark and disast and hope that
will sure suffer hope eclips and power that must lai down it
coronet in dust
and what ha it brought to you yva beyond a fair bodi and a soul of
strength
it ha brought a spirit humphrei between them the bodi and the soul
have bred a spirit and in the fire of tribul from that spirit ha
been distil the essenc of etern love that is time gift to me
and therefor although still he rule me here i mock at fate and she
wave her hand with a gestur of defianc at the sternfac sexless
effigi which sat abov us the sword across it knee
look look she went on in a swell voic of music point to the
statu of the dotard and the beauteou woman thei implor fate thei
worship fate i do not implor i do not worship or ask a sign as even
oro doe and as did hi forefath i rise abov and triumph as fate
the god of my peopl set hi foot upon the sun so i set my foot upon
fate and thenc like a swimmer from a rock leap into the water of
immort
i look at her whose presenc as happen from time to time had grown
majest beyond that of woman i studi her deep ey which were full
of light not of thi world and i grew afraid
what do you mean i ask yva you talk like on who ha finish
with life
it pass she answer quickli life pass like breath fade from
a mirror so should all talk who breath beneath the sun
ye yva but if you went and left me still breath on that mock
glass
if so what of it will not your breath fade also and join mine where
all vapour go or if it were your that fade and mine that remain
for some few hour is it not the same i think humphrei that alreadi
you have seen a belov breath melt from the glass of life she ad
look at me earnestli
i bow my head and answer
ye and therefor i am asham
oh why should you be asham humphrei who ar not sure but that
two breath mai yet be on breath how do you know that there is a
differ between them
you drive me mad yva i cannot understand
nor can i altogeth humphrei why should i see that i am no
more than woman as you ar no more than man i would alwai have
you rememb humphrei that i am no spirit or sorceress but just a
womanlik her you lost
i look at her doubtfulli and answer
women do not sleep for two hundr thousand year women do not take
dream journei to the star women do not make the dead past live again
befor the watcher ey their hair doe not glimmer in the dusk nor
do their bodi gleam nor have thei such strength of soul or ey so
wonder or loveli so great
these word appear to distress her who as it seem to me wa abov
all thing anxiou to prove herself woman and no more
all these qualiti ar noth humphrei she cri as for the
beauti such as it is it come to me with my blood and with it the
glitter of my hair which is the heritag of those who for gener
have drunk of the lifewat my mother wa loveli than i as wa her
mother or so i have heard sinc onli the fairest were the wive of
the king of the children of wisdom for the rest such art as i have
spring not from magic but from knowledg which your peopl will acquir
in dai to come that is if oro spare them sure you abov all
should know that i am onli woman she ad veri slowli and search
my face with her ey
why yva dure the littl while that we have been togeth i have
seen much which make me doubt even bicklei the sceptic doubt also
i will tell you though i am not sure that you will believ me she
glanc about her as though she were frighten lest someon should
overhear her word or read her thought then she stretch out her
hand and draw my head toward her put her lip to my ear and
whisper
becaus onc you saw me die as women often diegiv life for life
i saw you die i gasp
she nod then continu to whisper in my ear not in her own voic
but anoth
go where you seem call to go far awai oh the wonder place in
which you will find me not know that you have found me goodby for
a littl while onli for a littl while my own my own
i knew the voic as i knew the word and know i think that i should
have fallen to the ground had she not support me with her strong
arm
who told you i stammer wa it bicklei or bastin thei knew
though neither of them heard those holi word
not bicklei nor bastin she answer shake her head no nor you
yourself awak or sleep though onc by the lake yonder you
said to me that when a certain on lai dy she bade you seek her
elsewher for certainli you would find her humphrei i cannot sai who
told me those word becaus i do not know i think thei ar a memori
humphrei
that would mean that you yva ar the same as on who wasnot call
yva
the same as on who wa call natali humphrei she repli in
solemn accent on whom you love and whom you lost
then you think that we live again upon thi earth
again and yet again until the time come for us to leav the earth
for ever of thi inde i am sure for that knowledg wa part of the
secret wisdom of my peopl
but you were not dead you onli slept
the sleep wa a deathsleep which went by like a flash ye in an
instant or so it seem onli the shell of the bodi remain preserv
by mortal art and when the return spirit and the light of life were
pour into it again it awok but dure thi long deathsleep that
spirit mai have spoken through other lip and that light mai have shone
through other ey though of these i rememb noth
then that dream of our visit to a certain star mai be no dream
i think no dream and you too have thought as much
in a wai ye yva but i could not believ and turn from what i held
to be a phantasi
it wa natur humphrei that you should not believ hearken in thi
templ a while ago i show you a pictur of myself and of a man who
love me and whom i love and of hi death at oro hand did you note
anyth about that man
bicklei did i answer wa he right
i think that he wa right sinc otherwis i should not have love you
humphrei
i rememb noth of that man yva
it is probabl that you would not sinc you and he ar veri far apart
while between you and him flow wide sea of death wherein ar set
island of life perhap mani of them but i rememb much who seem to
have left him but a veri littl while ago
when you awok in your coffin and threw your arm about me what did
you think yva
i thought you were that man humphrei
there wa silenc between us and in that silenc the truth came home to
me then there befor the effigi of fate and in the desol glow
templ we plight anew our troth made holi by a past that thu so
wonderfulli live again
of thi consecr hour i sai no more let each pictur it as he will
a glori as of heaven fell upon us and in it we dwelt a space
belov she whisper at length in a voic that wa choke as though
with tear if it chanc that we should be separ again for a
littl while you will not griev over much
know all i should try not to griev yva see that in truth we
never can be part but do you mean that i shall die
be mortal either of us might seem to die humphrei and she bent
her head as though to hide her face you know we go into danger thi
dai
doe oro realli purpos to destroi much of the world and ha he in
truth the power yva
he doe so purpos and most certainli he ha the power unlessunless
some other power should stai hi hand
what other power yva
oh perhap that which you worship that which is call love the love
of man mai avert the massacr of men i hope so with all my heart hist
oro come i feel i know that he come though not in search of us who
ar veri far from hi thought tonight follow me swiftli
she sped across the templ to where a chapel open out of it which wa
full of the statu of dead king for here wa the entranc to their
burial vault we reach it and hid behind the base of on of these
statu by stand to our full height without be seen we still
could see between the feet of the statu that stood upon a pedest
then oro came
chapter xxiv the chariot of the pit
oro came and of necess alon yet there wa that in hi air as he
advanc into the templ which suggest a monarch surround by the
pomp and panopli of a great court he march hi head held high as
though herald and pursuiv went in front of him as though nobl
surround him and guard or regiment follow after him let it be
admit that he wa a great figur in hi gorgeou robe with hi long
white beard hi hawklik featur hi tall shape and hi glitter
ey which even at that distanc i could see inde onc or twice i
thought that he glanc out of the corner of them toward the chapel
where we were hid but thi i think wa fanci for as yva said hi
thought were set elsewher
he reach the statu of fate and stood for a while contempl it and
the suppliant figur on either side as though he were wait for hi
invis court to arrang itself then he dof hi jewel cap to
the effigi and knelt befor it ye oro the ancient the superman
the god as the earli peopl of the earth fanci such a be name
on full of wrath reveng jealousi capric and power knelt in
supplic to thi imag of stone which he believ to be the home
of a spirit therebi show himself to be after all not so far remov
from the savag whose idol bastin had destroi more in a clear and
reson voic which reach us even across that great space he put
up hi prayer it ran someth as follow for although i did not
understand the languag in which he spoke yva translat it to me in a
whisper
god of the son of wisdom god of the whole earth onli god to whom
must bow everi other power and dominion to thee i oro the great king
make prayer and offer sacrific twenti time ten thousand year and
more have gone by sinc i oro visit thi thy templ and knelt
befor thi thy live effigi yet thou ruler of the world dost
rememb the prayer i made and the sacrific i offer the prayer wa
for triumph over my enemi and the sacrific a promis of the live of
half of those who in that dai dwelt upon the earth thou heardest the
prayer thou didst bow thy head and accept the sacrific yea the
prayer wa grant and the sacrific wa made and in it were count
the number of my foe
then i slept through countless gener i slept on and at my side
wa the on child of my bodi that wa left to me what chanc to my
spirit and to her dure that sleep thou knowest alon but doubtless
thei went forth to work thy end
at the appoint time which thou didst decre i awok again and found
in my hous stranger from anoth land in the compani of on of those
whose spirit i drew forth i visit the peopl of the new earth
and found them even baser and more evil than those whom i had known
therefor sinc thei cannot be better i purpos to destroi them
also and on their wreck to rebuild a gloriou empir such as wa that
of the son of wisdom at it prime
a sign o fate ruler of the world give me a sign that my desir shall
be fulfil
he paus stretch out hi arm and stare upward while he wait
i felt the solid rock on which i stood quiver and swai beneath my feet
so that yva and i clung to each other lest we should fall thi chanc
also the shock of the earth tremor for such without doubt it wa
threw down the figur of the ancient man and the love woman which
knelt as though make prayer to fate and shook the marbl sword from
off it knee as it fell oro caught it by the hilt and rise wave
it in triumph
i thank thee god of my peopl from the begin he cri thou
hast given to me thy last servant thine own sword and i will us it
well for these worshipp of thine who have fallen thou shalt have
other ye all those who dwell in the new world that is to be my
daughter and the man whom she ha chosen to be the father of the king
of the earth and with him hi companion shall be the first of the
hundr of million that ar to follow for thei shall kiss thy feet or
perish thou shalt set thy foot upon the neck of all other god thou
shalt rule and thou alon and as of old oro be thy minist
still hold the sword he flung himself down as though in an ecstasi
and wa silent
i read the omen otherwis whisper yva the worshipp of fate ar
overthrown hi sword of power is fallen but not into the hand that
clasp it and he totter on hi throne a greater god assert dominion
of the world and thi fate is but hi instrument
oro rose again
on prayer more he cri give me life long life that i mai
execut thy decre by word or gestur show me a sign that i shall be
satisfi with life a year for everi year that i have live or twain
he wait stare about him but no token came the idol did not
speak or bow it head as yva had told me it wa wont to do in sign of
accept prayer how she knew not onli i thought i heard the echo of
oro cri run in a whisper of mockeri round the soar dome
onc more oro flung himself upon hi knee and began to prai in a
verit agoni
god of my forefath god of my lost peopl i will hide naught from
thee he said i who fear noth els fear death the priestfool
yonder with hi new faith ha spoken blunder word of judgment and
damnat which though i do not believ them yet stick in my heart
like arrow i will stamp out hi faith and with thi ancient sword of
thine drive back the new god into the dark whenc thei came yet
what if some water of truth flow through the channel of hi leaden
lip and what if becaus i have rule and will rule as thou didst
decre therefor in some dim place of soul i must bear these burden
of terror and of doom which i have bound upon the back of other nai
it cannot be for what power is there in all the univers that dare to
make a slave of oro and to afflict him with stripe
yet thi can be and mayhap will be that present i lose my path in
the wai of everlast dark and becom strengthless and forgotten
as ar those who went befor me while my crown of power shine on
younger brow ala i grow old sinc aeon of sleep have not renew
my strength my time is short and yet i would not die as mortal must
oh god of my peopl whom i have serv so well save me from the
death i dread for i would not die give me a sign give me the ancient
sacr sign
so he spoke lift hi proud and splendid head and watch the statu
with wide expect ey
thou dost not answer he cri again wouldst thou desert me fate
then bewar lest i set up some new god against thee and hurl thee from
thine immemori throne while i live i still have power i who am the
last of thy worshipp sinc it seem that my daughter turn her back
on thee i will get me to the sepulchr of the king and take counsel
with the dust of that wizard who first taught me wisdom even from the
depth of death he must come to my call clad in a mockeri of life and
comfort me a littl while yet i will wait and if thou answer not then
fate soon ill tear the sceptr from thy hand and thou shalt join the
compani of dead god and throw asid the sword again oro laid
down hi head upon the ground and stretch out hi arm in the last
abas of supplic
come whisper yva while there is yet time present he will seek
thi place to descend to the sepulchr and if he learn that we have
read hi heart and know him for a coward desert of hi outworn god
sure he will blot us out come and be swift and silent
we crept out of the chapel yva lead and along the circl of the
great dome till we reach the gate here i glanc back and perceiv
that oro look unutter small in that vast look like a
dead man still lai outstretch befor the sternfac unansw
effigi which with all hi wisdom he believ to be live and divin
perhap onc it wa but if so it star had set for ever like those of
amon jupit and baal and he wa it last worshipp
now we were safe but still we sped on till we reach the portico of
our sleep place then yva turn and spoke
it is horribl she said and my soul sicken oh i thank the
strength which made it that i have no desir to rule the earth and
be innoc of death do not fear to die and cross hi threshold
ye it is horribl i answer yet all men fear death
not when thei have found love humphrei for that i think is hi true
name and with it written on hi brow he stand upon the neck of fate
who is still my father god
then he is not your yva
nai onc it wa so but now i reject him he is no longer mine as oro
threaten and perchanc dare do in hi rage i have broken hi chain
though in anoth fashion ask me no more perhap on dai you will
learn the path i trod to freedom
then befor i could speak she went off
rest now for within a few hour i must come to lead you and your
companion to a terribl place yet whatev you mai see or hear be
not afraid humphrei for i think that oro god ha no power over you
strong though he wa and that oro plan will fail while i who too
have knowledg shall find strength to save the world
then of a sudden onc again she grew splendid almost divin no more a
woman but as it were an angel some fire of pure purpos seem to burn
up in her and to shine out of her ey yet she said littl onli thi
inde
to everyon i think there come the moment of opportun when choic
must be made between what is great and what is small between self and
it desir and the good of other wander in the wai thi dai that
moment mai draw near to you or me and if so sure we shall greet it
well such is bastin lesson which i have striven to learn
then she flung her arm about me and kiss me on the brow as a mother
might and wa gone
strang enough perhap becaus of my mental exhaust for what i
had pass through seem to overwhelm me so that i could no longer so
much as think with clear even after all that i have describ i
slept like a child and awok refresh and well
i look at my watch to find that it wa now eight oclock in the
morn in thi horribl place where there wa neither morn nor noon
nor night but onli an etern bright that came i knew not whenc
and never learn
i found that i wa alon sinc bicklei and bastin had gone to fill
our bottl with the lifewat present thei return and we at a
littl with that water to drink on did not need much food it wa
a somewhat silent meal for our circumst were a check on talk
moreov i thought that the other look at me rather oddli perhap
thei guess someth of my midnight visit to the templ but if so
thei thought it wisest to sai noth nor did i enlighten them
shortli after we had finish yva appear she wa wonderfulli quiet
and gentl in her manner calm also and greet all of us with much
sweet of our experi dure the night she said no word to me
even when we were alon on differ i notic about her howev
that she wa cloth in garment such as i had never seen her wear
befor thei were close fit save for a flow cape and made of
some grei materi not unlik a coars homespun or even asbesto cloth
still thei becam her veri well and when i remark upon them all she
answer wa that part of our road would be rough even her feet were
shod with high buskin of thi grei stuff
present she touch bastin on the shoulder and said that she would
speak with him apart thei went togeth into on of the chamber of
that dwell and there remain for perhap the half of an hour it wa
toward the end of thi time that in the intens silenc i heard a crash
from the direct of the templ as though someth heavi had
fallen to the rocki floor bicklei also heard thi sound when the two
reappear i notic that though still quit calm yva look radiant
and if i mai sai so even more human and womanli than i had ever seen
her while bastin also seem veri happi
on ha strang experi in life ye veri strang he remark
appar address the air which left me wonder to what
particular experi he might refer well i thought that i could
guess
friend said yva it is time for us to be go and i am your guid
you will meet the lord oro at the end of your journei i prai you to
bring those lamp of your with you sinc all the road is not lighten
like thi place
i should like to ask said bicklei whither we go and for what
object point on which up to the present we have had no definit
inform
we go friend bicklei deep into the bowel of the world far deeper i
think than ani mortal men have gone hitherto that is of your race
then we shall perish of heat said bicklei for with everi thousand
feet the temperatur rise mani degre
not so you will pass through a zone of heat but so swiftli that if
you hold your breath you will not suffer overmuch then you will come to
a place where a great draught blow which will keep you cool and thenc
travel on to the end
ye but to what end ladi yva
that you will see for yourselv and with it other wondrou thing
here some new idea seem to strike her and after a littl hesit
she ad
yet why should you go oro ha command it it is true but i think
that at the last he will forget it must be decid swiftli there is
yet time i can place you in safeti in the sepulchr of sleep where you
found us thenc cross to the main island and sail awai quickli in your
boat out into the great sea where i believ you will find succour know
that after disobei him you must meet oro no more lest it should be
the wors for you if that be your will let us start what sai you
she look at me
i sai yva that i am will to go if you come with us not
otherwis
i sai said bicklei that i want to see all thi supernatur rubbish
thoroughli explod and that therefor i should prefer to go on with
the busi
and i sai said bastin that my most earnest desir is to be clear
of the whole thing which weari and perplex me more than i can tell
onli i am not go to run awai unless you think it desir to do
so too ladi yva i want you to understand that i am not in the least
afraid of the lord oro and do not for on moment believ that he will
be allow to bring about disast to the world as i understand is
hi wick object therefor on the whole i am indiffer and quit
prepar to accept ani decis at which the rest of you mai arriv
be it understood said yva with a littl smile when bastin had
finish hi sermonett that i must join my father in the bowel of
the earth for a reason which will be made plain afterward therefor
if you go we part as i think to meet no more still my advic is that
you should go
it is fortun that we did not accept yva offer had
we done so we should have found ourselv shut in and
perish as shall be toldh a
to thi our onli answer wa to attend to the light of our lamp and
the dispos of our small impedimenta such as our tin of oil and water
bottl yva note thi and laugh outright
courag did not die with the son of wisdom she said
then we set out yva walk ahead of us and tommi frisk at her side
our road led us through the templ as we pass the great gate i
start for there in the centr of that gloriou build i perceiv
a chang the statu of fate wa no more it lai broken upon the
pavement among those fragment of it two worshipp which i had seen
shaken down some hour befor
what doe thi mean i whisper to yva i have felt no other
earthquak
i do not know she answer or if i know i mai not sai yet learn
that no god can live on without a singl worshipp and in a fashion
that idol wa aliv though thi you will not believ
how veri remark said bastin contempl the ruin if i were
superstiti which i am not i should sai that thi occurr wa an
omen indic the final fall of a fals god at ani rate it is dead
now and i wonder what caus it
i felt an earth tremor last night said bicklei though it is odd
that it should onli have affect thi particular statu a thousand
piti for it wa a wonder work of art
then i rememb and remind bicklei of the crash which we had heard
while yva and bastin were absent on some secret busi in the chamber
walk the length of the great church if so it could be call we
came to an aps at the head of it where had it been christian the
altar would have stood in thi aps wa a littl open door through
which we pass beyond it lai a space of rough rock that look as
though it had been partial prepar for the erect of build and
then abandon all thi space wa light howev like the rest of
the citi of nyo and in the same mysteri wai led by yva we thread
our path between the rough stone follow a steep downward slope
thu we walk for perhap half a mile till at length we came to the
mouth of a huge pit that must i imagin have lain quit a thousand
feet below the level of the templ
i look over the edg of thi pit and shrank back terrifi it seem
to be bottomless moreov a great wind rush up it with a roar
sound like to that of an angri sea or rather there were two wind
perhap draught would be a better term if i mai appli it to an air
movement of so fierc and terribl a natur on of these rush up
the pit and on rush down or it mai have been that the up rush
altern with the down rush realli it is imposs to sai
what is thi place i ask cling to the other and shrink back
in alarm from it sheer edg and bottomless depth for that thi wa
enorm we could see by the shaft of light which flow downward
farther than the ey could follow
it is a vent up and down which air pass from and to the central
hollow of the earth yva answer doubtless in the begin through
it travel that mighti forc which blew out these cave in the heat
rock as the craftsman blow out glass
i understand said bastin just like on blow out a bubbl on a
pipe onli on a larger scale well it is veri interest but i have
seen enough of it also i am afraid of be blown awai
i fear that you must see more answer yva with a smile sinc we
ar about to descend thi pit
do you mean that we ar to go down that hole and if so how i dont
see ani lift or move staircas or anyth of that sort
easili and safe enough bastin see
as she spoke a great flat rock of the size of a small room appear
born upward as i suppos by the terrif draught which roar past
us on it upward cours when it reach the lip of the shaft it hung
a littl while then move across and began to descend with such
incred swift that in a few second it had vanish from view
oh said bastin with hi ey almost start out of hi head
that the lift is it well i tell you at onc i dont like the look
of the thing it give me the creep suppos it tilt
it doe not tilt answer yva still smile i tell you bastin
that there is naught to fear onli yesterdai i rode thi rock and
return unharm
that is all veri well ladi yva but you mai know how to balanc it
also when to get on and off
if you ar afraid bastin remain here until your companion return
thei i think will make the journei
bicklei and i intim that we would though to tell the truth if less
frank we were quit as alarm as bastin
no ill come too i suppos on mai as well die thi wai as ani other
and if anyth were to happen to them and i were left alon it would
be wors still
then be prepar said yva for present thi airchariot of our
will return when it appear and hang upon the edg step on to it and
throw yourselv upon your face and all will be well at the foot of
the shaft the motion lessen till it almost stop and it is easi to
spring or even crawl to the firm earth
then she stoop down and lift tommi who wa snif suspici
at the edg of the pit hi long ear blown straight abov hi head
hold him beneath her left arm and under her cloak that he might not
see and be frighten
we wait a while in silenc perhap for five or six minut among
the most disagre i think that i ever pass then far down in the
bright below appear a black speck that seem to grow in size as
it rush upward
it come said yva prepar and do as i do do not spring or run
lest you should go too far step gentli on to the rock and to it
centr and there lie down trust in me all of you
there noth els to do groan bastin
the great stone appear and as befor hung at the edg of the pit
yva step on to it quietli as she did so catch hold of my wrist
with her disengag hand i follow her feel veri sick and promptli
sat down then came bicklei with the air of the virtuou hero of
a romanc walk a pirat plank and also sat down onli bastin
hesit until the stone began to move awai then with an ejacul
of here goe he jump over the interven crack of space and land
in the middl of us like a sack of coal had i not been seat realli i
think he would have knock me off the rock as it wa with on hand
he grip me by the beard and with the other grasp yva robe of
neither of which would he leav go for quit a long time although we
forc him on to hi face the lantern which he held flew from hi grasp
and descend the shaft on it own account
you silli fool exclaim bicklei whose perturb show itself in
anger there goe on of our lamp
hang the lamp mutter the prostrat bastin we shant want it in
heaven or the other place either
now the stone which had quiver a littl beneath the impact of bastin
steadi itself again and with a slow and majest movement sail
to the other side of the gulf there it felt the forc of graviti or
perhap the weight of the return air press on it which i do not
know at ani rate it began to fall slowli at first then more swiftli
and afterward at an incred pace so that in a few second the mouth
of the pit abov us grew small and present vanish quit awai
i look up at yva who wa stand composedli in the midst of our
prostrat shape she bent down and call in my ear
all is well the heat begin but it will not endur for long
i nod and glanc over the edg of the stone at bastin lantern
which wa sail alongsid of us till present we pass it bastin
had lit it befor we start i think in a moment of aberr and it
burn for quit a long while show like a star when the shaft
grew darker as it did by degre a circumst that testifi to the
excel of the make which is on advertis not to go out in ani
wind not that we felt wind or even draught perhap becaus we were
travel with it
then we enter the heat zone about thi there wa no doubt for the
perspir burst out all over me and the burn air scorch my
lung also tommi thrust hi head from beneath the cloak with hi tongu
hang out and hi mouth wide open
hold your breath cri yva and we obei until we nearli burst at
least i did but what happen to the other i do not know
fortun it wa soon over and the air began to grow cool again by
now we had travel an enorm distanc it seem to be mile on
mile and i notic that our terrif speed wa slacken also that
the shaft grew more narrow till at length there were onli a few feet
between the edg of the stone and it wall the result of thi or so
i suppos wa that the compress air act as a buffer lessen our
momentum till at length the huge stone move but veri slowli
be readi to follow me cri yva again and we rose to our feet that
is bicklei and i did but poor bastin wa semicomatos the stone
stop and yva sprang from it to a rock platform level with which it
lai we follow drag bastin between us as we did so someth hit
me gentli on the head it wa bastin lamp which i seiz
we ar safe sit down and rest said yva lead us a few pace awai
we obei and present by the dim light saw the stone begin to stir
again thi time upward in anoth twenti second it wa awai on it
neverend journei
doe it alwai go on like that said bastin sit up and stare
after it
ten of thousand of year ago it wa journei thu and ten of
thousand of year henc it will still be journei or so i think
she repli why not sinc the strength of the draught never chang
and there is noth to wear it except the air
somehow the vision of thi huge stone first loos and set in motion by
heaven know what agenc travel from aeon to aeon up and down
that shaft in obedi to some law i did not understand impress my
imagin like a nightmar inde i often dream of it to thi dai
i look about me we were in some cavern place that could be but
dimli seen for here the light that flow down the shaft from the
upper cave where it wa mysteri creat scarc shone and often
inde wa entir cut off when the everjournei stone wa in the
narrowest part of the passag i could see howev that thi cavern
stretch awai both to right and left of us while i felt that from
the left as we sat face the shaft there drew down a strong blast of
fresh air which suggest that somewher howev far awai it must open
on to the upper world for the rest it bottom and wall seem to be
smooth as though thei had been plane in the past ag by the action of
cosmic forc bicklei notic thi the first and point it out to me
we had littl time to observ howev for present yva said
if you ar rest friend i prai you light those lamp of your
sinc we must walk a while in dark
we did and start still travel downhil yva walk ahead with me
and tommi who seem somewhat depress and clung close to our heel
the other two follow argu strenuous about i know not what it
wa their wai of work off irrit and alarm
i ask yva what wa about to happen for a great fear oppress me
i am not sure belov she answer in a sweet and gentl voic who
do not know all oro secret but as i think great thing we ar now
deep in the bowel of the world and present perhap you will see
some of it mighti forc whereof your ignor race have no knowledg
do their everlast work
then how is it that we can breath here i ask becaus thi road
that we ar follow connect with the upper air or us to do so
sinc onc i follow it it is a long road and the climb is steep
but at last it lead to the light of the bless sun nor ar there ani
pitfal in the path would that we might tread it togeth humphrei
she ad with passion and be rid of mysteri and the gloom or that
light which is wors than gloom
why not i ask eagerli why should we not turn and flee
who can flee from my father the lord oro she repli he would
snare us befor we had gone a mile moreov if we fled by tomorrow
half the world must perish
and how can we save it by not fly yva
i do not know humphrei yet i think it will be save perchanc by
sacrific that is the keyston of your faith is it not therefor if
it is ask of you to save the world you will not shrink from it will
you humphrei
i hope not i repli without enthusiasm i admit inde it struck
me that a busi of thi sort wa better fit to bastin than
to myself or at ani rate to hi profess i think she guess my
thought for by the light of the lamp i saw her smile in her dazzl
wai then after a swift glanc behind her she turn and suddenli
kiss me as she did so call down everlast bless on my
head and on my spirit there wa someth veri wonder about thi
benedict of yva and it thrill me through and through so that to
it i could make no answer
next moment it wa too late to retreat for our narrow passag turn
and we found ourselv in a wondrou place i call it wondrou becaus
of it we could see neither the begin nor the end nor the roof nor
aught els save the rock on which we walk and the side or wall that
our hand touch nor wa thi becaus of dark sinc although it
wa not illumin like the upper cavern light of a sort wa present
it wa a veri strang light consist of brilliant and intermitt
flash or globe of blue and lambent flame which seem to leap from
nowher into nowher or sometim to hang pois in mid air
how odd thei ar said the voic of bastin behind me thei remind
me of those blue spark which jump up from the wire of the tramwai in
london on a dark night you know dont you bicklei i mean when the
conductor pull round that long stick with an iron wheel on the top of
it
nobodi but you could have thought of such a comparison bastin
answer bicklei still multipli a thousandfold thei ar not
unlik
nor inde were thei except that each blue flash wa as big as the full
moon and in on place or anoth thei were so continu that on could
have read a letter by their light also the effect of them wa ghastli
and most unnatur terrifi too sinc even their brillianc could
not reveal the extent of that gigant hollow in the bowel of the
world wherein thei leapt to and fro like lightn or hung like huge
uncanni lantern
chapter xxv sacrific
the air in thi place must be charg with some form of electr
but the odd thing is that it doe not seem to harm us said bicklei
in a matteroffact fashion as though he were determin not to be
astonish
to me it look more like marsh fire or st elmo light though how
these can be where there is no vapour i do not know i answer
as i spoke a particularli larg ball of flame fell from abov it
resembl a shoot star or a meteor more than anyth els that i
had ever seen and made me wonder whether we were not perhap stand
beneath some inki unseen sky
next moment i forgot such specul for in it blue light which
made him terribl and ghastli i perceiv oro stand in front of us
clad in a long cloak
dear me said bastin he look just like the devil doesnt he and
now i come to think of it thi isnt at all a bad imit of hell
how do you know it is an imit ask bicklei
becaus whatev might be the case with you bicklei if it were the
ladi yva and i should not be here
even then i could not help smile at thi reparte but the argument
went no further for oro held up hi hand and yva bent the knee in
greet to him
so you have come all of you he said i thought that perhap there
were on or two who would not find courag to ride the fly stone i
am glad that it is not so sinc otherwis he who had shown himself a
coward should have had no share in the rule of that new world which is
to be therefor i chose yonder road that it might test you
then if you will be so good as to choos anoth for us to return by i
shall be much oblig to you oro said bastin
how do you know that if i did it would not be more terribl preacher
how do you know inde that thi is not your last journei from which
there is no return
of cours i cant be sure of anyth oro but i think the question
is on which you might more appropri put to yourself accord
to your own show you ar now extrem old and therefor your end is
like to come at ani moment of cours howev if it did you would
have on more journei to make but it wouldnt be polit for me to sai
in what direct
oro heard and hi splendid ici face wa twist with sudden rage
rememb the scene in the templ where he had grovel befor hi
god utter agonis unansw prayer for ad dai i understood
the reason of hi wrath it wa so great that i fear lest he should
kill bastin who onli a few hour befor be it rememb had tri to
kill him then and there as doubtless he could have done if he wish
fortun if he felt it the impuls pass
miser fool he said i warn you to keep a watch upon your word
yesterdai you would have slain me with your toi todai you stab me with
your illomen tongu be fear lest i silenc it for ever
i am not in the least fear oro sinc i am sure that you cant hurt
me at all ani more than i could hurt you last night becaus you see it
wasnt permit when the time come for me to die i shall go but you
will have noth to do with that to tell the truth i am veri sorri
for you as with all your great your soul is of the earth earthi
also sensual and devilish as the apostl said and i am afraid veri
malign and you will have a great deal to answer for shortli your
wont be a happi deathb oro becaus you see you glori in your sin
and dont know what repent mean
i must add that when i heard these word i wa fill with the most
unbound admir for bastin fearless courag which enabl him
thu to beard thi supertyr in hi den so inde were we all for i
read it in yva face and heard bicklei mutter
bravo splendid after all there is someth in faith
even oro appreci it with hi intellect if not with hi heart for
he stare at the man and made no answer in the languag of the ring he
wa quit knock out and almost humbl chang the subject
we have yet a littl while he said befor that happen which i have
decre come humphrei that i mai show you some of the marvel of thi
bubbl blown in the bowel of the world and he motion to us to pick
up the lantern
then he led us awai from the wall of the cavern if such it wa for a
distanc of perhap six or seven hundr pace here suddenli we came to
a great groov in the rocki floor as broad as a veri wide roadwai and
mayhap four feet in depth the bottom of thi groov wa polish and
glitter inde it gave us the impress of be iron or other or
which had been weld togeth beneath the grind of some immeasur
weight just at the spot where we struck the groov it divid into
two for thi reason
in it centr the floor of iron or whatev it mai have been rose the
fraction of an inch at first but afterward more sharpli and thi at
a spot where the groov had a somewhat steep downward dip which appear
to extend onward i know not how far
follow along thi central rise for a great wai nearli a mile i
should think we observ that it becam ever more pronounc till at
length it end in a razoredg cliff which stretch up higher than
we could see even by the light of the electr discharg stand
against the edg of thi cliff we perceiv that at a distanc from it
there were now two groov of about equal width on of these ran awai
into the dark on our right as we face the sharp edg and at an
everwiden angl while the other at a similar angl ran into the
dark to the left of the knife of cliff that wa all
no there were two more notabl thing neither of the groov now lai
within hundr of yard of the cliff perhap a quarter of a mile for
be it rememb we had follow the rise rock between them to put it
quit clearli it wa exactli as though on line of rail had separ
into two line of rail as often enough thei do and an observ
stand on high ground between could see them both vanish into
tunnel to the right and left but far apart
the second notabl thing wa that the righthand groov where first we
saw it at the point of separ wa not polish like the lefthand
groov although at some time or other it seem to have been subject
to the pressur of the same terrif weight which cut it fellow out of
the bed of rock or iron as the sharp wheel of a heavili laden wagon
sink rut into a roadwai
what doe it all mean lord oro i ask when he had led us back to
the spot where the on groov began to be two groov that is a mile
or so awai from the razoredg cliff
thi humphrei he answer that which travel along yonder road
when it reach thi spot on which we stand follow the lefthand path
which is made bright with it passag yet could a giant at that moment
of it touch thi exact spot on which i lai my hand thrust it with
suffici strength it would leav the lefthand road and take the
righthand road
and if it did what then lord oro
then within an hour or so when it had travel far enough upon it
wai the balanc of the earth would be chang and great thing would
happen in the world abov as onc thei happen in bygon dai now do
you understand humphrei
good heaven ye i understand now i answer but fortun
there is no such giant
oro broke into a mock laugh and hi grei old face lit up with a
fiendish exult as he cri
fool i oro am that giant onc in the dead dai i turn the balanc
of the world from the righthand road which now is dull with disus to
the lefthand road which glitter so brightli to your ey and the face
of the earth wa chang now again i will turn it from the lefthand
road to the righthand road in which for million of year it wa wont
to run and onc more the face of the earth shall chang and those who
ar left live upon the earth or who in the cours of ag shall come
to live upon the new earth must bow down to oro and take him and hi
seed to be their god and king
when i heard thi i wa overwhelm and could not answer also i
rememb a certain confus pictur which yva had shown to us in the
templ of nyo but support by hi disbelief bicklei ask
and how often doe the balanc of which you speak come thi wai lord
oro
onc onli in mani year the number is my secret bicklei he repli
then there is everi reason to hope that it will not troubl us
remark bicklei with a suspicion of mockeri in hi voic
do you think so you learn bicklei ask oro if so i do not
unless my skill ha fail me and my calcul have gone awri that
travel of which i tell should present be with us hearken now what
is that sound we hear
as he spoke there reach our ear the first faroff murmur of
a dread music i cannot describ it in word becaus that is
imposs but it wa someth like to the buzz of a thousand
hummingtop such as ar love by children becaus of their weird song
back to the wall cri oro triumphantli the time is short
so back we went oro paus a while behind and overtak us with long
determin stride yva led us glide at my side and as i thought
now and again glanc at my face with a look that wa half anxiou and
half piti also twice she stoop and pat tommi
we reach the wall though not quit at the spot whenc we had start
to examin the groov road at least i think thi wa so sinc now
for the first time i observ a kind of littl window in it rocki
face it stood about five feet from it floor level and wa perhap ten
inch squar not more in short except for it shape it resembl a
ship porthol rather than a window it substanc appear to be talc
or some such materi and inch thick yet through it after oro
had cast asid some sort of cover came a glare like that of a
searchlight in fact it wa a searchlight so far as concern on of
it purpos
by thi window or porthol lai a pile of cloak also four object which
look like zulu battl shield cut in some unknown metal or materi
veri deftli veri quietli yva lift these cloak and wrap on of
them about each of us and while she wa thu emploi i notic that
thei were of a substanc veri similar to that of the gown she wore
which i have describ but harder next she gave on of the metallik
shield to each of us bid us hold them in front of our bodi and
head and onli to look through certain slit in them in which were
eyepiec that appear to be of the same horni stuff as the searchlight
window further she command us to stand in a row with our back
against the rock wall at certain spot which she indic with great
precis and whatev we saw or heard on no account to move
so there we stood bicklei next to me and beyond him bastin then yva
took the fourth shield as i note a much larger on than our and
place herself between me and the searchlight or porthol on the other
side of thi wa oro who had no shield
these arrang took some minut and dure that time occupi all
our attent when thei were complet howev our curios and fear
began to reassert themselv i look about me and perceiv that oro
had hi right hand upon what seem to be a rough stone rod in shape
not unlik that with which railwai point ar move he shout to us
to stand still and keep the shield over our face then veri gentli he
press upon the lever the porthol sank the fraction of an inch and
instantli there leapt from it a most terrif blaze of lightn which
shot across the black in front and as lightn doe reveal
far far awai anoth wall or rather cliff like that against which we
leant
all work well exclaim oro in a satisfi voic lift hi hand
from the rod and the strength which i have store will be more than
enough
meanwhil the hum nois came nearer and grew in volum
i sai said bicklei as you know i have been sceptic but i dont
like thi busi oro what ar you go to do
sink half the world beneath the sea said oro and rais up that
which i drown more than two thousand centuri ago but as you do not
believ that i have thi power bicklei why do you ask such question
i believ that you have it which wa why i tri to shoot you
yesterdai said bastin for your soul sake i beg you to desist from
an attempt which i am sure will not succe but which will certainli
involv your etern damnat sinc the failur will be no fault of
your
then i spoke also sai
i implor you lord oro to let thi busi be i do not know exactli
how much or how littl you can do but i understand that your object is
to slai men by million in order to rais up anoth world of which you
will be the absolut king as you were of some past empir that ha been
destroi either through your agenc or otherwis no good can come of
such ambit like bastin for your soul sake i prai you to let them
be
what humphrei sai i repeat said yva my father although you know
it not you seek great evil and from these hope you sow you will
harvest noth save a loss of which you do not dream moreov your
plan will fail now i who am like yourself of the children of wisdom
have spoken for the first and last time and my word ar true i prai
you give them weight my father
oro heard and grew furiou
what he said ar you against me everi on and my own daughter
also i would lift you up i would make you ruler of a new world i
would destroi your vile civilis which i have studi with my ey
that i mai build better to you humphrei i would give my onli child
in marriag that from you mai spring a divin race of king and yet you
ar against me and set up your puni scrupl as a barrier across my path
of wisdom well i tread them down i go on my appoint wai but bewar
how you try to hold me back if ani on of you should attempt to come
between me and my end know that i will destroi you all obei or die
well he ha had hi chanc and he wont take it said bastin in the
silenc that follow the man must go to the devil hi own wai and
there is noth more to be said
i sai the silenc but it wa no more silent the distant hum grew
to a roar the roar to a hellish hurrican of sound which present
drown all attempt at ordinari speech
then bellow like ten million of bull at length far awai there
appear someth terribl i can onli describ it appear as that
of an attenu mountain on fire when it drew nearer i perceiv that
it wa more like a balletdanc whirl round and round upon her toe
or rather all the balletdanc in the world roll into on and then
multipli a million time in size no it wa like a mushroom with two
stalk on abov and on below or a huge top with a point on which it
spun a swell belli and anoth point abov but what a top it
must have been two thousand feet high if it wa an inch and it
circumfer who could measur
on it came danc swai and spin at a rate inconceiv so
that it look like a gigant wheel of fire yet it wa not fire that
cloth it but rather some phosphoresc sinc from it came no heat
ye a phosphoresc arrang in band of ghastli blue and lurid red
with streak of other colour run up between and a kind of wave
fring of purpl
the firemountain thunder on with a voic like to that of avalanch
or of iceberg crash from their parent glacier to the sea it
terrif aspect wa appal and it weight caus the solid rock
to quiver like a leaf watch it we felt as ant might feel at the
advent of the crack of doom for it mere height and girth and size
overwhelm us we could not even speak the last word i heard were
from the mouth of oro who scream out
behold the balanc of the world you miser doubt men and
behold me chang it pathturn it as the steersman turn a ship
then he made certain sign to yva who in obedi to them approach
the porthol or searchlight to which she did someth that i could not
distinguish the effect wa to make the beam of light much stronger
and sharper also to shift it on to the point or foot of the spin
mountain and by an aim of the len from time to time to keep it
there
thi went on for a while sinc the dread thing did not travel fast
notwithstand the fright speed of it revolut i should doubt
inde if it advanc more quickli than a man could walk at ani rate
so it seem to us but we had no mean of judg it real rate of
progress whereof we knew as littl as we did of the cours it follow
in the bowel of the earth perhap that wa spiral from the world
deep heart upward and thi wa the highest point it reach or
perhap it remain stationari but still spin for score or
hundr of year in some central powerhous of it own whenc in
obedi to unknown law from time to time it made these terrif
journei
no on know unless perhap oro did in which case he kept the
inform to himself and no on will ever know at ani rate there it
wa travel toward us on it giant butt the peg of the top as it
were which hidden in a cloud of frictionborn spark that envelop it
like the cup of a curv flower of fire whirl round and round at
an infinit speed it wa on thi flame flower that the searchlight
plai steadili doubtless that oro might mark and measur it monstrou
progress
he is go to try to send the thing down the righthand path i
shout into bicklei ear
cant be done noth can shift a travel weight of ten of
million of ton on inch bicklei roar back try to look
confid
clearli howev yva thought that it could be done for of a sudden she
cast down her shield and throw herself upon her knee stretch out
her hand in supplic to her father i understood as did we all
that she wa implor him to abandon hi hellish purpos he glare at
her and shook hi head then as she still went on prai he struck
her across the face with hi hand and push her to her feet again my
blood boil as i saw it and i think i should have sprung at him had
not bicklei caught hold of me shout dont or he will kill her and
us too
yva lift her shield and return to her station and in the blue
discharg which now flash almost continu and the phosphoresc
glare of the advanc mountain i saw that though her beauti face
work beneath the pain of the blow her ey remain seren and
purpos even then i wonderedwhat wa the purpos shine through
them also i wonder if i wa about to be call upon to make that
sacrific of which she had spoken and if so how of on thing i wa
determinedthat if the call came it should not find me deaf yet all
the while i wa horribl afraid
at anoth sign from oro yva did someth more to the lensagain
be alongsid of her i could not see what it wa the beam of light
shift and wander till far awai it fell exactli upon that spot
where the rock began to rise into the ridg which separ the two
groov or road and end in the razoredg cliff moreov i observ
that oro who left it the last of us had either place someth white
to mark thi first infinitesim bulg of the floor of the groov or
had smear it with chalk or shine pigment i observ also what i
had not been abl to see befor that a thin white line ran across the
floor no doubt to give the precis direct of thi paint rise of
rock and that the glare of the searchlight now lai exactli over that
line
the monstrou flame gyroscop fashion in natur workshop for
such without doubt it wa wa draw near emit as it came
a tumult of sound which with the echo that thei caus almost
overwhelm our sens poor littl tommi alreadi cow although he
wa a boldnatur beast broke down entir and i could see from hi
open mouth that he wa howl with terror he stare about him then
ran to yva and paw at her evid ask to be taken into her arm
she thrust him awai almost fierc and made sign to me to lift him
up and hold him beneath my shield thi i did reflect sadli that
if i wa to be sacrif tommi must share my fate i even thought of
pass him on to bicklei but had no time inde i could not attract
hi attent for bicklei wa stare with all hi ey at the
nightmarelik spectacl which wa in progress about us inde no
nightmar no wild imagin of which the mind of man is capabl
could rival the aspect of it stupend fact
think of them the unmeasur space of black thread by those
globe of ghastli incandesc that now hung a while and now shot
upward downward across appar without origin or end like a
stream of meteor that had gone mad then the travel mountain two
thousand feet in height or more with it enorm saucerlik rim
paint round with band of lurid red and blue and about it grind
foot the tulip bloom of emit flame then the fiercefac oro at hi
post hi hand upon the rod wait remorseless to drown half of thi
great world with the love yva stand calmei like a saint in hell
and watch me abov the edg of the shield which such a saint might
bear to turn asid the fieri dart of the wick and lastli we three
men flatten terrorstricken against the wall
nightmar imagin no these pale befor that scene which it wa
given to our human ey to wit
and all the while bend bow toward usawai from usmak
obeis to the path in front as though in greet to the path behind
as though in farewel instinct with a horribl life with a hideou and
gigant grace that titan terror whirl onward to the mark of fate
at the moment noth could persuad me that it wa not aliv and did
not know it aw mission vision flash across my mind i thought
of the peopl of the world sleep in their bed or go about their
busi or engag even in the work of war i thought of the ship
upon the sea steam steadili toward their faroff port then i
thought of what present might happen to them of the tremor follow
by convuls of the sudden crash down of citi such as we had
seen in the pictur yva show us in the templ of the inflow of the
water of the deep pile up in mighti wave of the woe and desol
as of the end of the world and of the quiet follow death so
i thought and in my heart prai to the great archarchitect of the
univers to stretch out hi arm to avert thi fearsom ruin of hi
handiwork
oro glare hi thin finger tighten their grip upon the rod hi hair
and long beard seem to bristl with furiou and delight excit
the purplefring rim of the monster had long overshadow the white
patch of rock it grind foot wa scarc ten yard awai oro made
more sign to yva who beneath the shelter of her shield again bent
down and did someth that i could not see then as though her part
were plai she rose drew the grei hood of her cloak all about her
face so that her ey alon remain visibl took on step toward me
and in the broken english we had taught her call into my ear
humphrei god you bless humphrei we meet soon forget not me
she step back again befor i could attempt to answer and next
instant with a hideou concentr effort oro bend himself doubl
thrust upon the rod as i could see from hi open mouth shout while
he thrust
at the same moment with a swift spring yva leapt immedi in
front of the len or window so that the metal shield with which she
cover herself press against it substanc
simultan oro flung up hi arm as though in horror
too late the shutter fell and from behind it there sprang out a rush of
live flame it struck on yva shield and expand to right and left
the insul shield and garment that she wore seem to resist it
for a fraction of time she stood there like a glow angel wrap in
fire
then she wa swept outward and upward and at a littl distanc
dissolv like a ghost and vanish from our sight
yva wa ash yva wa gone the sacrific wa consumm
and not in vain not in vain on her poor breast she had receiv the
full blast of that hellish lightn flash yet whilst destroi it
turn awai from her seek the free path of the air so it came
about that it obstruct strength struck the foot of the travel
gyroscop diffus and did not suffic to thrust it that on necessari
inch on which depend the fate of half the world or miss it
altogeth pass awai on either side even so the huge gleam
mountain rock and trembl onc twice thrice it bow itself
toward us as though in majest homag to great pass awai for a
second too it cours wa check and at the check the earth quak
and trembl ye then the world shook and the blue globe of fire
went out while i wa thrown to the ground
when thei return again the flame monster wa onc more sail
majest upon it wai and down the accustom lefthand path
inde the sacrific wa not in vain the world shookbut yva had save
the world
chapter xxvi tommi
i lai still a while on my back as i had fallen and beneath the
shieldlik defenc which yva had given to me notwithstand the
fireresist metalis stuff of which it wa made i note that
it wa twist and almost burnt through doubtless the storedup
electr or earth magnet or whatev it mai have been that had
leapt out of that hole be diffus by the resist with which it
wa met had graze me with it outer edg and had it not been for the
shield and cloak i also should have been burn up i wish oh how
i wish that it had been so then by now all must have finish and
i should have known the truth as to what await us beyond the chang
sleep or dream or perchanc the fullest life also i should not have
learn alon
ly there thu idli as though in a halfsleep i felt tommi lick
my face and throw my arm about the poor littl frighten beast i
watch the great worldbal as it retreat on it etern journei
at on time it vast project rim had overshadow us and almost
seem to touch the cliff of rock against which we leant i rememb
that the effect of that shine arch a thousand feet or so abov our
head wa wonder it remind me of a canopi of blackest thunder
cloud support upon a framework of wheel rainbow while beneath
it all the children of the devil shout togeth in joi i note thi
effect onli a few second befor yva spoke to me and leapt into the path
of the flash
now howev it wa far awai a mere flame wheel that becam
gradual smaller and it satan voic were grow faint as i have
said i watch it disappear idli reflect that i should never
look upon it like again also that it wa someth well worth go
forth to see then i becam awar that the hum howl din had
decreas suffici to enabl me to hear human voic without effort
bastin wa address bickleylik myself thei were both upon the
ground
her translat as you mai have notic bicklei if you were not too
frighten wa realli veri remark no doubt it will have remind
you as it did me of that of elijah she had exactli the appear of
a person go up to heaven in a vehicl of fire the destin wa
certainli the same and even the cloak she wore ad a familiar touch
and increas the similar
at ani rate it did not fall upon you answer bicklei with someth
like a sob in a voic of mingl aw and exasper for good
sake bastin stop your biblic parallel and let us ador ye let us
ador the divinest creatur that the earth ha born
never have i love bicklei more than when i heard him utter those word
divinest is a larg term bicklei and on to which i hesit to
subscrib rememb as i do certain of the prophet and the earli
father with all their fault not of cours to mention the apostl
but here he paus for suddenli all three of us becam awar of oro
he also ha been thrown to the ground by the strength of the prison
forc which he gather and loos upon their unholi errand but as
i rejoic to observ had suffer from them much more than ourselv
doubtless thi wa ow to the fact that he had sprung forward in
a last wild effort to save hi daughter or to prevent her from
interf with hi experi i know not which as a result hi right
cheek wa much scorch hi right arm wa wither and helpless and
hi magnific beard wa half burnt off him further veri evid he
wa suffer from sever shock for he rock upon hi feet and shook
like an aspen leaf all thi howev did not interfer with the
liveli of hi grief and rage
there he stood a tower shape like a lightningsmitten statu and
curs us especi bastin
my daughter ha gone he cri burn up by the fieri power that is
my servant noth remain of her but dust and priest thi is your
do you poison her heart with your childish doctrin of merci and
sacrific and the rest so that she threw herself into the path of the
flash to save some miser race that she had never even known
he paus exhaust whereon bastin answer him with spirit
ye oro she be a holi woman ha gone where you will never follow
her also it is your own fault sinc you should have listen to her
entreati instead of box her ear like the brute you ar
my daughter is gone went on oro recov hi strength and my
great design ar ruin yet onli for a while he ad for the
worldbal will return again if not till long after your lifespan
ar done
if you dont doctor yourself lord oro said bicklei also rise
i mai tell you as on who understand such thing that most like it
will be after your lifespan is done also although their effect mai be
delai sever shock from burn and overexcit ar apt to prove
fatal to the ag
oro snarl at him no other word describ it
and there ar other thing physician he said which ar apt to
prove fatal to the young at least now you will no longer deni my
power
i am not so sure answer bicklei sinc it seem that there is a
greater power name that of a woman love and sacrific
and a greater still interrupt bastin which put those idea into
her head
as for you humphrei went on oro i rejoic to think that you at
least have lost two thing that man desir abov all other thingsth
woman you sought and the futur kingship of the world
i stood up and face him
the first i have gain although how you do not understand oro
i answer and of the second see that it would have come through
you on your condit i am inde glad to be rid i wish no power
that spring from murder and no gift from on who answer hi
daughter prayer with blow
for a moment he seem remors
she vex me with her foolish he said then hi rage blaze up
again
and it wa you who taught it to her he went on you ar guilti all
three of you and therefor i am left with none to serv me in my ag
therefor also my mighti scheme ar overthrown
also oro if you speak truth therefor half the world is save i
ad quietli and on ha left it of whom it wa unworthi
you think that these civilis of your as you ar pleas to call
them ar save do you he sneer yet even if bicklei were right
and i should die and becom powerless i tell you that thei ar alreadi
damn i have studi them in your book and seen them with my ey
and i sai that thei ar rotten befor ever thei ar ripe and that their
end shall be the end of the son of wisdom to die for lack of increas
that is why i would have save the east becaus in it alon there is
increas and thenc alon can rise the great last race of man which i
would have given to your children for an heritag moreov think not
that you western have done with war i tell you that thei ar but
begun and that the sword shall eat you up and what the sword spare
class shall snatch from class in the struggl for supremaci and eas
thu he spoke with extraordinari and concentr bitter that i
confess would have frighten me had i been capabl of fear which at
the moment i wa not who is afraid when he ha lost all
nor wa bastin alarm if for other reason
i think it right to tell you oro he said that the onli futur you
need troubl about is your own god almighti will look after the western
civilis in whatev wai he mai think best as you mai rememb he
did just now onli i am sure you wont be here to see how it is done
again furi blaze in oro ey
at least i will look after you you halfbr dog who yap out
illomen propheci of death into my face sinc the three of you
love my daughter whom you brought to her doom and were by her belov
if differ i think it best that you should follow on her road
how that is the question shall i leav you to starv in these great
cavesnai look not toward the road of escap which doubtless she
point out to you for as humphrei know i can travel swiftli and i
will make sure that you find it block or shall i and he glanc
upward at the great globe of wander fire as though he purpos to
summon them to be our death as doubtless he could have done
i do not care what you do i answer wearili onli i would beg you
to strike quickli yet for my friend i am sorri sinc it wa i who led
them on thi quest and for you too tommi i ad look at the
poor littl hound you were foolish tommi i went on when you
scent out that old tyrant in hi coffin at least for our own sake
inde the dog wa terribl scare he whine continu and from time
to time ran a littl wai and then return to us suggest that we
should go from thi horrorhaunt spot lastli as though he understood
that it wa oro who kept us there he went to him and jump up lick
hi hand in a beseech fashion
the superman look at the dog and as he look the rage went out of
hi face and wa replac by someth resembl piti
i do not wish the beast to die he mutter to himself in low
reflect tone as though he thought aloud for of them all it alon
like and did not fear me i might take it with me but still it would
perish of grief in the loneli of the cave moreov she love it
whom i shall see no more ye yva as he spoke the name hi voic
broke a littl yet if i suffer them to escap thei will tell my stori
to the world and make me a laughingstock well if thei do what doe it
matter none of those western fool would believ it think that thei
knew all like bicklei thei would mock and sai that thei were mad or
liar
again tommi lick hi hand but more confid as though instinct
told him someth of what wa pass in oro mind i watch with
an idl wonder marvel whether it were possibl that thi merciless
be would after all spare us for the sake of the dog
so strang to sai it came about for suddenli oro look up and said
get you gone and quickli befor my mood chang the hound ha save
you for it sake i give you your live who otherwis should certainli
have di she who ha gone point out to you i doubt not a road that
run to the upper air i think that it is still open inde he ad
close hi ey for a moment i see that it is still open if long
and difficult follow it and should you win through take your boat and
sail awai as swiftli as you can whether you die or live i care noth
but my hand will be clean of your blood although your ar stain
with yva begon and my curs go with you
without wait for further word we went to fetch our lantern
waterbottl and bag of food which we had laid down at a littl
distanc as we approach them i look up and saw oro stand some
wai off the light from on of the blue globe of fire which pass
close abov hi head shone upon him and made him ghastli moreov it
seem to me as though approach death had written it name upon hi
malevol counten
i turn my head awai for about hi aspect in those sinist
surround there wa someth horribl someth menac and
repel to man and of him i wish to see no more nor inde did i
for when i glanc in that direct again oro wa gone i suppos that
he had retreat into the shadow where no light plai
we gather up our gear and while the other were relight the
lantern i walk a few pace forward to the spot where yva had been
dissolv in the devour fire someth caught my ey upon the rocki
floor i pick it up it wa the ring or rather the remain of the
ring that i had given her on that night when we declar our love amidst
the ruin by the crater lake she had never worn it on her hand but for
her own reason as she told me suspend it upon her breast beneath
her robe it wa an ancient ring that i had bought in egypt fashion
of gold in which wa set a veri hard basalt or other black stone on
thi wa engrav the ank or loop cross which wa the egyptian symbol
of life and round it a snake the symbol of etern the gold wa for
the most part melt but the stone be so hard and protect by the
shield and asbesto cloak for such i suppos it wa had resist the
furi of the flash onli now it wa white instead of black like a burnt
onyx that had known the funer pyre inde perhap it wa an onyx i
kiss it and hid it awai for it seem to me to convei a greet and
with it a promis
then we start a veri sad and deject trio leav with a shudder
that vast place where the blue light plai etern we came to the
shaft up and down which the travel stone pursu it endless path
and saw it arriv and depart again
i wonder he did not send us that wai said bicklei point to it
i am sure i am veri glad it never occur to him answer bastin
for i am certain that we could not have made the journei again without
our guid yva
i look at him and he ceas somehow i could not bear as yet to hear
her belov name spoken by other lip
then we enter the passag that she point out to us and began a most
terribl journei which so far as we could judg for we lost ani exact
count of time took us about sixti hour the road it is true wa
smooth and unblock but the ascent wa fearfulli steep and slipperi
so much so that often we were oblig to pull each other up it and lie
down to rest
had it not been for those larg feltcov bottl of lifewat
i am sure we should never have won through but thi marvel elixir
drunk a littl at a time alwai reinvigor us and gave us strength
to push on also we had some food and fortun our spare oil held
out for the dark in that tunnel wa complet tommi becam so
exhaust that at length we must carri him by turn he would have di
had it not been for the water inde i thought that he wa go to
die
after our last rest and a short sleep howev he seem to begin to
recov and gener there wa someth in hi manner which suggest
to us that he knew himself to be not far from the surfac of the earth
toward which we had crawl upward for thousand upon thousand of
feet fortun without meet with ani zone of heat which wa not
bearabl
we were right for when we had stagger forward a littl further
suddenli tommi ran ahead of us and vanish then we heard him bark
but where we could not see sinc the tunnel appear to take a turn
and continu but thi time on a downward cours while the sound of the
bark came from our right we search with the lantern which were
now begin to die and found a littl hole almost fill with fallen
piec of rock we scoop these awai with our hand make an apertur
larg enough to creep through a few more yard and we saw light the
bless light of the moon and in it stood tommi bark hoars next
we heard the sound of the sea we struggl on desper and present
push our wai through bush and veget on to a steep decliv
down thi we roll and scrambl to find ourselv at last ly upon
a sandi beach whilst abov us the full moon shone in the heaven
here with a prayer of thank we flung ourselv down and slept
if it had not been for tommi and we had gone further along the tunnel
which i have littl doubt stretch on beneath the sea where i wonder
should we have slept that night
when we woke the sun wa shine high in the heaven evid there
had been rain toward the dawn though as we were ly beneath the
shelter of some broadleav tree from it we had suffer littl
inconveni oh how beauti after our sojourn in those unholi
cave were the sun and the sea and the sweet air and the raindrop
hang on the leav
we did not wake of ourselv inde if we had been left alon i am
sure that we should have slept the clock round for we were terribl
exhaust what woke us wa the chatter of a crowd of orofenan who were
gather at a distanc from the tree and engag in stare at us in a
frighten wai also the bark of tommi who object to their intrus
among the peopl i recognis our old friend the chief marama by hi
feather cloak and sit up beckon to him to approach after a good
deal of hesit he came walk delic like agag and stop
from time to time to studi us as though he were not sure that we were
real
what frighten you marama i ask him
you frighten us o friendfromthesea whenc did you and the healer
and the bellow come and why do your face look like those of ghost
and why is the littl black beast so largeei and so thin over
the lake we know you did not come for we have watch dai and night
moreov there is no cano upon the shore also it would not have been
possibl
why not i ask idli
come and see he answer
rise stiffli we emerg from beneath the tree and perceiv that we
were at the foot of the cliff against which the remain of the yacht had
been born by the great tempest inde there it wa within a coupl of
hundr yard of us
follow marama we climb the slope path which ran up the cliff
and ascend a knoll whenc we could see the lake and the cone of the
volcano in it centr at least we us to be abl to see thi cone but
now at ani rate with the nake ey we could make out noth except a
small brown spot in the midst of the water of the lake
the mountain which rose up mani feet in that storm which brought you to
orofena friendfromthesea ha now sunk till onli the veri top of it
is to be seen said marama solemnli even the rock of offer ha
vanish beneath the water and with it the hous that we built for
you
ye i said affect no surpris but when did that happen
five night ago the world shook friendfromthesea and when the sun
rose we saw that the mouth of the cave which appear on the dai of your
come had vanish and that the holi mountain itself had sunk deep
so that now onli the crest of it is left abov the water
such thing happen i repli carelessli
ye friendfromthesea like mani other marvel thei happen where you
and your companion ar therefor we beg you who can aris out of the
earth like spirit to leav us at onc befor our island and all of us
who dwell thereon ar drown beneath the ocean leav us befor we kill
you if inde you be men or die at your hand if as we think you be
evil spirit who can throw up mountain and drag them down and creat
god that slai and move about in the bowel of the world
that is our intent for our busi here is done i answer
calmli come now and help us to depart but first bring us food bring
it in plenti for we must victual our boat
marama bow and issu the necessari order inde food suffici for
our immedi need wa alreadi there as an offer and of it we at
with thank
then we board the ship and examin the lifeboat thank to our
precaut it wa still in veri fair order and onli need some littl
caulk which we did with grass fibr and pitch from the store after
thi with the help of the orofenan who work hard in their desper
desir to be rid of us we drew the boat into the sea and provis
her with store from the ship and with an ampl suppli of water
everyth be readi at last we wait for the even wind which
alwai blew off shore to start as it wa not due for half an hour or
more i walk back to the tree under which we had slept and tri to
find the hole whenc we had emerg from the tunnel on to the face of
the cliff
my hurri search prove useless the decliv of the cliff wa cover
with tropic growth and the heavi rain had wash awai everi trace of
our descent and veri like fill the hole itself with earth at ani
rate of it i could discov noth then as the breez began to blow
i return to the boat and here bade adieu to marama who gave me hi
feather cloak as a farewel gift
goodby friendfromthesea he said to me we ar glad to have
seen you and thank you for mani thing but we do not wish to see you
ani more
goodby marama i answer what you sai we echo at least you
have now no great lump upon your neck and we have rid you of your
wizard but bewar of the god oro who dwell in the mountain for if
you anger him he will sink your island beneath the sea
and rememb all that i have taught you shout bastin
marama shiver though whether at the mention of the god oro of whose
power the orofenan had so pain a recollect or at the result of
bastin teach i do not know and that wa the last we shall ever
see of each other in thi world
the island fade behind us and sore at heart becaus of all that we had
found and lost again for three dai we sail northward with a fair
and steadi wind on the fourth even by an extraordinari stroke of
fortun we fell in with an american tramp steamer trade from the
south sea island to san francisco to the captain who treat us veri
kindli we said simpli that we were a parti of englishmen whose yacht
had been wreck on a small island sever hundr of mile awai of
which we knew neither the name if it had on nor the posit
thi stori wa accept without question for such thing often happen
in those latitud and in due cours we were land at san francisco
where we made certain deposit befor the british consul as to the
loss of the yacht star of the south then we cross america have
obtain fund by cabl and sail for england in a steamer fly the
flag of the unit state
of the great war which made thi desir i do not speak sinc it
ha noth or rather littl to do with thi histori in the end
we arriv safe at liverpool and thenc travel to our home in
devonshir
thu end the histori of our deal with oro the superman who began
hi life more than two hundr and fifti thousand year ago and with
hi daughter yva whom bastin still often call the glitter ladi
chapter xxvii bastin discov a resembl
there is littl more to tell
shortli after our return bicklei like a patriot englishman
volunt for servic at the front and depart in the uniform of the
ramc befor he left he took the opportun of explain to bastin
how much better it wa in such a nation emerg as exist to
belong to a profess in which a man could do someth to help the
bodi of hi countrymen that had been broken in the common caus than
to on like hi in which it wa onli possibl to pelt them with vain
word
you think that do you bicklei answer bastin well i hold that
it is better to heal soul than bodi becaus as even you will have
learn out there in orofena thei last so much longer
i am not certain that i learn anyth of the sort said bicklei
or even that oro wa more than an ordinari old man he said that he
had live a thousand year but what wa there to prove thi except hi
word which is worth noth
there wa the ladi yva word also which is worth a great deal
bicklei
ye but she mai have meant a thousand moon further as accord
to her own show she wa still quit young how could she know her
father ag
quit so bicklei but all she actual said wa that she wa of the
same ag as on of our women of twentyseven which mai have meant two
hundr and seventi for all i know howev put that asid you
will admit that thei had both slept for two hundr and fifti thousand
year
i admit that thei slept bastin becaus i help to awaken them but
for how long there is noth to show except those star map which ar
probabl quit inaccur
thei ar not inaccur i broke in for i have had them check by
lead astronom who sai that thei show a marvel knowledg of the
heaven as these were two hundr and fifti thousand year ago and ar
todai
here i should state that those two metal map and the ring which i gave
to yva and found again after the catastroph were absolut the onli
thing connect with her or with oro that we brought awai with us
the former i would never part with feel their valu as evid
therefor when we descend to the citi nyo and the depth beneath
i took them with me wrap in cloth in my pocket thu thei were
preserv everyth els went when the rock of offer and the cave
mouth sank beneath the water of the lake
thi mai have happen either in the earth tremor which no doubt
wa caus by the advanc of the terrif worldbal or when the
electr power though diffus and turn by yva insul bodi
struck the great gyroscop travel foot with suffici strength
not to shift it inde on to the righthand path as oro had design
but still to caus it to stagger and even perhap to halt for the
fraction of a second even thi paus mai have been enough to caus
convuls of the earth abov inde i gather from marama and other
orofenan that such convuls had occur on and around the island
at what must have correspond with that moment of the loos of the
forc
thi loss of our belong in the hous of the rock of offer wa
the more grievou becaus among them were some kodak photograph which
i had taken includ portrait of oro and on of yva that wa realli
excel to sai noth of pictur of the mouth of the cave and of
the ruin and crater lake abov how bitterli i regret that i did not
keep these photograph in my pocket with the mapplat
even if the starmap ar correct still it prove noth said
bicklei sinc possibl oro astronom skill might have enabl
him to draw that of the sky at ani period though i allow thi is
imposs
i doubt hi take so much troubl mere to deceiv three wander
who lack the knowledg even to check them i said but all thi
miss the point bicklei howev long thei had slept that man and
woman did aris from seem death thei did dwell in those marvel
cave with their evid of depart civilis and thei did show
us that fear worldwand gyroscop these thing we saw
i admit that we saw them arbuthnot and i admit that thei ar on and
all beyond human comprehens to that extent i am convert and i
mai add humbl said bicklei
so you ought to be exclaim bastin see that you alwai swore
that there wa noth in the world that is not capabl of a perfectli
natur explan
of which all these thing mai be capabl bastin if onli we held the
kei
veri well bicklei but how do you explain what the ladi yva did i mai
tell you now what she command me to conceal at the time name that
she becam a christian so much so that by her own will i baptis and
confirm her on the veri morn of her sacrific doubtless it wa
thi that chang her heart so much that she becam will of cours
without my knowledg to leav everyth she care for here he look
hard at me and lai down her life to save the world half of which she
believ wa about to be drown by oro now consid her histori
and upbring i call thi a spiritu marvel much greater than ani
you now admit and on you cant explain bicklei
no i cannot explain or at ani rate i will not try he answer
also stare hard at me whatev she believ or did not believ and
whatev would or would not have happen she wa a great and wonder
woman whose memori i worship
quit so bicklei and now perhap you see my point that what you
describ as mere vain word mai also be help to mankind more so
inde than your surgic instrument and pill
you couldnt convert oro anywai exclaim bicklei with irrit
no bicklei but then i have alwai understood that the devil is beyond
convers becaus he is beyond repent you see i think that if
that old scoundrel wa not the devil himself at ani rate he wa a
bit of him and if i am right i am not asham to have fail in hi
case
even oro wa not utterli bad bastin i said reflect on certain
trait of merci that he had shown or that i dream him to have shown
in the cours of our mysteri midnight journei to variou part of
the earth also i rememb that he had love tommi and for hi sake
had spare our live lastli i do not altogeth wonder that he came to
certain hasti conclus as to the valu of our modern civilis
i am veri glad to hear it humphrei sinc while there is a spark left
the whole fire mai burn up again and i believ that to the divin merci
there ar no limit though oro will have a long road to travel befor
he find it and now i have someth to sai it ha troubl me veri
much that i wa oblig to leav those orofenan wander in a kind of
religi twilight
you couldnt help that said bicklei see that if you had stop
by now you would have been wander in religi light
still i am not sure that i ought not to have stop i seem to have
desert a field that wa open to me howev it cant be help sinc
it is certain that we could never find that island again even if oro
ha not sunk it beneath the sea as he is quit capabl of do to
cover hi track so to speak so i mean to do my best in anoth field
by wai of aton
you ar not go to becom a missionari i said
no but with the consent of the bishop who i think believ that my
locum got on better in the parish than i do as no doubt wa the case
i too have volunt for the front and been accept as a chaplain
of the 201st divis
why that mine said bicklei
is it i am veri glad sinc now we shall be abl to pursu our
pleasant argument and to do our best to open each other mind
you fellow ar more fortun than i am i remark i also
volunt but thei wouldnt take me even as a tommi although i
misstat my ag thei told me or at least a specialist whom i saw did
afterward that the blow i got on the head from that sorcer boi
i know i know broke in bicklei almost roughli of cours thing
might go wrong at ani time but with care you mai live to old ag
i am sorri to hear it i said with a sigh at least i think i am
meanwhil fortun there is much that i can do at home inde a
cours of action ha been suggest to me by an old friend who is now in
author
onc more bicklei and bastin in their warstain uniform were dine
at my tabl and on the veri night of their return from the front which
wa unexpect inde tommi nearli di of joi on hear their voic
in the hall thei who plai a worthi part in the great struggl
had much to tell me and natur their more recent experi had
overlaid to some extent those which we share in the mysteri island
of orofena inde we did not speak of these until just as thei were
go awai bastin paus beneath a veri beauti portrait of my late
wife the work of an artist famou for hi power of bring out the
inner charact or what some might call the soul of the sitter he
stare at it for a while in hi shortsight wai then said do you
know arbuthnot it ha sometim occur to me and never more than
at thi moment that although thei were differ in height and so on
there wa a realli curiou physic resembl between your late wife
and the ladi yva
ye i answer i think so too
bicklei also examin the portrait veri carefulli and as he did so i
saw him start then he turn awai sai noth
such is the summari of all that ha been import in my life it is i
admit an odd stori and on which suggest problem that i cannot solv
bastin deal with such thing by that accept which is the privileg
and hallmark of faith bicklei dispos or us to dispos of them by
a blank denial which carri no convict and least of all to himself
what is life to most of us who like bicklei think ourselv learn
a round short but still with time and to spare wherein to be dull and
lonesom a fate treadmil to which we were condemn we know not
how but appar through the casual passion of those who went befor
us and ar now forgotten caus us as the bibl sai to be born in
sin up which we walk wearili we know not why seem never to make
progress off which we fall outworn we know not when or whither
such upon the surfac it appear to be nor in fact doe our ascertain
knowledg as bicklei would sum it up take us much further no prophet
ha yet arisen who attempt to defin either the origin or the reason
of life even the veri greatest of them himself is quit silent on thi
matter we ar tempt to wonder why is it becaus life as express in
the higher of human be is or will be too vast too multiform and
too gloriou for ani definit which we could understand is it
becaus in the end it will involv for some if not for all majesti on
unfathom majesti and glori upon unimagin glori such as at present
far outpass the limit of our thought
the experi which i have record in these page awak in my heart a
hope that thi mai be so bastin is wont like mani other to talk in
a light fashion of etern without in the least comprehend what he
mean by that gigant term it is not too much to sai that etern
someth without begin and without end and involv it
would appear an everlast changeless is a state beyond
human comprehens as a matter of fact we mortal do not think in
constel so to speak or in aeon but by the measur of our own
small earth and of our few dai thereon we cannot realli conceiv of
an exist stretch over even on thousand year such as that
which oro claim and the bibl accord to a certain earli race of men
omit of cours hi two thousand five hundr centuri of sleep and
yet what is thi but on grain in the hourglass of time on dai in the
lost record of our earth of it sister the planet and it father the
sun to sai noth of the univers beyond
it is becaus i have come in touch with a prolong though perfectli
finit exist of the sort that i try to pass on the reflect
which the fact of it awok in me there ar other reflect connect
with yva and the marvel of her love and it variou manifest
which aris also but these i keep to myself thei concern the wonder of
woman heart which is a microcosm of the hope and fear and desir
and despair of thi human of our whereof from ag to ag she is the
mother

note by j r bicklei mrc
within about six month of the date on which he wrote the last word
of thi histori of our joint adventur my dear friend humphrei
arbuthnot di suddenli as i had foreseen that probabl he would do
from the result of the injuri he receiv in the island of orofena
he left me the sole executor to hi will under which he divid hi

which is strictli ti up to bastin and on third to be devot
under my direct to the advanc of scienc
hi end appear to have been instantan result from an effus

i would sai also that i am contempl anoth visit to the south sea
island where i wish to make some further investig i dare
sai howev that these will be barren of result as the fountain of
lifewat is buri for ever nor as i think will ani human be
stand again in the hadeslik hall of nyo it is probabl also that it
would prove imposs to rediscov the island of orofena if inde
that volcan land still remain abov the water of the deep
now that he is a veri wealthi man bastin talk of accompani me for
purpos quit differ from my own but on the whole i hope he will
abandon thi idea i mai add that when he learn of hi unexpect
inherit he talk much of the deceit of rich but that he
ha not as yet taken ani step to escap their golden snare inde he
