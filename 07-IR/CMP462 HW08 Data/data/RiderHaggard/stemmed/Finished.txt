thi book although it can be read as a separ stori is the
third of the trilogi of which mari and child of storm ar
the first two part it narrat through the mouth of allan
quatermain the consumm of the vengeanc of the wizard
zikali alia the open of road or
thethingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn upon the royal zulu
hous of which senzangacona wa the founder and cetewayo our
enemi in the war of 1879 the last repres who rule as a
king although of cours much is ad for the purpos of
romanc the main fact of histori have been adher to with some
faith
with these the author becam acquaint a full gener ago
fortun have given him a part in the event that preced the
zulu war inde he believ that with the except of colonel
phillip who as a lieuten command the famou escort of
twentyf policemen he is now the last survivor of the parti
who under the leadership of sir theophilu shepston or sompseu
as the nativ call him from the zambesi to the cape were
concern in the annex of the transvaal in 1877 recent
also he ha been call upon as a public servant to revisit south
africa and took the opportun to travel through zululand in
order to refresh hi knowledg of it peopl their custom
their mysteri and better to prepar himself for the write of
thi book here he stood by the fatal mount of isandhlawana
which with some detail of the battl is describ in these
page among the grave of mani whom onc he knew colonel
durnford pullein and other also he saw ulundi plain where
the trace of war still lie thick and talk with an old zulu
who fought in the attack impi until it crumbl awai befor
the fire of the martini and shell from the heavi gun the
battl of the wall of sheet iron he call it perhap becaus
of the flash fenc of bayonet
lastli in a meali patch he found the spot on which the corn
grow thin where king cetewayo breath hi last poison
without a doubt as he ha known for mani year it is to be
seen at the kraal omin name jazi or translat into
english finish the tragedi happen long ago but even now
the quietfac zulu who told the tale look about him as he
spoke would not tell it all ye as a young man i wa there
at the time but i do not rememb i do not knowth inkoosi
lundanda ie thi chronicl so name in past year by the
zulu stand on the veri place where the king diedhi bed wa
on the left of the doorhol of the hut and so forth but no
certain word as to the exact reason of thi sudden and violent
death or by whom it wa caus the name of that destroy of a
king is for ever hid
in thi stori the actual and immedi caus of the declar
of war against the british power is repres as the appear
of the white goddess or spirit of the zulu who is or wa
call nomkubulwana or inkosazanayzulu ie the princess of
heaven the exact circumst which led to thi decis ar
not now ascertain though it is known that there wa much
differ of opinion among the zulu induna or great captain
and like the writer mani believ that king cetewayo wa
person avers to war against hi old alli the english
the author friend mr j y gibson at present the
repres of the union in zululand write in hi admir
histori there wa a good deal of discuss amongst the
assembl zulu notabl at ulundi but of how counsel wa swai
it is not possibl now to obtain a reliabl account
the late mr f b fynnei frg who also wa hi friend in
dai bygon and with the except of sir theophilu shepston
who perhap knew the zulu and their languag better than ani
other offici of hi dai speak of thi fabl goddess wrote
i rememb that just befor the zulu war nomkubulwana appear
reveal someth or other which had a great effect throughout
the land
the us made of thi strang tradit guardian angel in the
follow tale is not therefor an unsupport flight of fanci
and the same mai be said of mani other incid such as the
account of the read of the proclam annex the transvaal
at pretoria in 1877 which have been introduc to serv the
purpos of the romanc

chapter i
allan quatermain meet anscomb
you my friend into whose hand if you live i hope these
scribbl of mine will pass on dai must well rememb the
12th of april of the year 1877 at pretoria sir theophilu
shepston or sompseu for i prefer to call him by hi nativ
name have investig the affair of the transvaal for a
coupl of month or so had made up hi mind to annex that
countri to the british crown it so happen that i allan
quatermain had been on a shoot and trade expedit at the
back of the lydenburg district where there wa plenti of game to
be kill in those time hear that great event were toward
i made up my mind curios be on of my weak to come
round by pretoria which after all wa not veri far out of my
wai instead of strike straight back to natal as it chanc i
reach the town about eleven oclock on thi veri morn of the
12th of april and trek to the church squar proceed to
outspan there as wa usual in the seventi the place wa full
of peopl english and dutch togeth and i note that the
former seem veri elat and were talk excitedli while the
latter for the most part appear to be sullen and depress
present i saw a man i knew a tall dark man a veri good
fellow and an excel shot name robinson by the wai you
knew him also for afterward he wa an offic in the pretoria
hors at the time of the zulu war the corp in which you held a
commiss i call to him and ask what wa up
a good deal allan he said as he shook my hand inde we
shall be lucki if all isnt up or someth like it befor the
dai is over shepston proclam annex the transvaal is
go to be read present
i whistl and ask
how will our boer friend take it thei dont look veri
pleas
that just what no on know allan burger the presid is
squar thei sai he is to have a pension also he think it
the onli thing to be done most of the holland up here dont
like it but i doubt whether thei will put out their hand
further than thei can draw them back the question iswhat will
be the line of the boer themselv there ar a lot of them
about all arm you see and more outsid the town
what do you think
cant tell you anyth mai happen thei mai shoot shepston
and hi staff and the twentyf policemen or thei mai just
grumbl and go home probabl thei have no fix plan
how about the english
oh we ar all crazi with joi but of cours there is no
organ and mani have no arm also there ar onli a few of
us
well i answer i came here to look for excit life
have been dull for me of late and it seem that i have found
it still i bet you those dutchmen do noth except protest
thei ar slim and know that the shoot of an unarm mission
would bring england on their head
cant sai i am sure thei like shepston who understand them
and the move is so bold that it take their breath awai but as
the kaffir sai when a strong wind blow a small spark will make
the whole veld burn it just depend upon whether the spark is
there if an englishman and a boer began to fight for instanc
anyth might happen goodby i have got a messag to deliv
if thing go right we might dine at the european tonight and if
thei dont good know where we shall dine
i nod sage and he depart then i went to my wagon to tell
the boi not to send the oxen off to graze at present for i
fear lest thei should be stolen if there were troubl but to
keep them ti to the trektow after thi i put on the best
coat and hat i had feel that as an englishman it wa my duti
to look decent on such an occas wash brush my hairwith
me a ceremoni without mean for it alwai stick upand
slip a load smith wesson revolv into my inner poacher
pocket then i start out to see the fun and avoid the
group of surlylook boer mingl with the crowd that i saw
wa gather in front of a long low build with a broad
stoep which i suppos rightli to be on of the govern
offic
present i found myself stand by a tall rather looselybuilt
man whose face attract me it wa cleanshaven and much
bronz by the sun but not in ani wai goodlook the featur
were too irregular and the nose wa a trifl too long for good
look still the impress it gave wa pleasant and the steadi
blue ey had that twinkl in them which suggest humour he
might have been thirti or thirtyf year of ag and
notwithstand hi rough dress that consist mainli of a pair
of trouser held up by a belt to which hung a pistol and a
common flannel shirt for he wore no coat i guess at onc that
he wa englishborn
for a while neither of us said anyth after the taciturn habit
of our peopl even on the veld and inde i wa fulli occupi
in listen to the trucul talk of a littl parti of mount
boer behind us i put my pipe into my mouth and began to hunt
for my tobacco take the opportun to show the hilt of my
revolv so that these men might see that i wa arm it wa
not to be found i had left it in the wagon
if you smoke boer tobacco said the stranger i can help you
and i note that the voic wa as pleasant as the face and knew
at onc that the owner of it wa a gentleman
thank you sir i never smoke anyth els i answer
whereon he produc from hi trouser pocket a pouch made of lion
skin of unusu dark colour
i never saw a lion as black as thi except onc beyond buluwayo
on the border of lobengula countri i said by wai of make
convers
curiou answer the stranger for that where i shot the
brute a few month ago i tri to keep the whole skin but the
white ant got at it
been trade up there i ask
noth so us he said just idl and shoot came
to thi countri becaus it wa on of the veri few i had never
seen and have onli been here a year i think i have had about
enough of it though can you tell me of ani boat run from
durban to india i should like to see those wild sheep in
kashmir
i told him that i did not know for certain as i had never taken
ani interest in india be an african elephanthunt and
trader but i thought thei did occasion just then robinson
pass by and call to me
theyll be here present quatermain but sompseu isnt come
himself
doe your name happen to be allan quatermain ask the
stranger if so i have heard plenti about you up in lobengula
countri and of your wonder shoot
ye i repli but as for the shoot nativ alwai
exagger
thei never exagger about mine he said with a twinkl in
hi ey anyhow i am veri glad to see you in the flesh though
in the spirit you rather bore me becaus i heard too much of
you whenev i made a particularli bad miss my gunbear
who at some time seem to have been your would sai ah if
onli it had been the inkosi macumazahn how differ would have
been the end my name is anscomb mauric anscomb he ad
rather shyli afterward i discov from a book of refer
that he wa a younger son of lord mountford on of the richest
peer in england
then we both laugh and he said
tell me mr quatermain if you will what those boer ar
sai behind us i am sure it is someth unpleas but as
the onli dutch i know is guten tag and vootsack gooddai and
get out that take me no forward
it ought to i answer for the substanc of their talk is
that thei object to be vootsack by the british govern as
repres by sir theophilu shepston thei ar declar that
thei won the land with their blood and want to keep their own
flag fly over it
a veri natur sentiment broke in anscomb
thei sai that thei wish to shoot all damn englishmen
especi shepston and hi peopl and that thei would make a
begin now were thei not afraid that the damn english
govern be anger would send thousand of damn english
rooibatj that is redcoat and shoot them out of evil
reveng
a veri natur conclus laugh anscomb again which i
should advis them to leav untest hush here come the
show
i look and saw a bodi of blackcoat gentlemen with on offic
in the uniform of a colonel of engin advanc slowli i
rememb that it remind me of a funer process follow
the corps of the republ that had gone on ahead out of sight
the process arriv upon the stoep opposit to us and began to
sort itself out whereon the english present rais a cheer and
the boer behind us curs audibl in the middl appear an
elderli gentleman with whisker and a stoop in whom i recogn
mr osborn known by the kaffir as malimati the chief of the
staff by hi side wa a tall young fellow yourself my friend
scarc more than a lad then carri paper the rest stood
to right and left in a formal line you gave a print
document to mr osborn who put on hi glass and began to read
in a low voic which few could hear and i notic that hi hand
trembl present he grew confus lost hi place found it
lost it again and came to a full stop
a nervousnatur man remark mr anscomb perhap he
think that those gentlemen ar go to shoot
that wouldnt troubl him i answer who knew him well hi
fear ar pure mental
that wa true sinc i know that thi same sir melmoth osborn as
he is now as i have told in the book i call child of storm
swam the tugela alon to watch the battl of indondakasuka rage
round him and on anoth occas kill two kaffir rush at
him with a right and left shot without turn a hair it wa
read thi paper that paralyz him not ani fear of what might
happen
there follow a veri awkward paus such as occur when a man
break down in a speech the member of the staff look at him
and at each other then behold you my friend grab the paper
from hi hand and went on read it in a loud clear voic
that young man ha plenti of nerv said mr anscomb
ye i repli in a whisper quit right though would have
been a bad omen if the thing had come to a stop
well there were no more breakdown and at last the long
document wa finish and the transvaal annex the british
began to cheer but stop to listen to the formal protest of the
boer govern if it could be call a govern when
everyth had collaps and the offici were be paid in
postag stamp i cant rememb whether thi wa read by
presid burger himself or by the offic who wa call state
secretari anywai it wa read after which there came an
awkward paus as though peopl were wait to see someth
happen i look round at the boer who were mutter and
handl their rifl uneasili had thei found a leader i realli
think that some of the wilder spirit among them would have begun
to shoot but none appear and the crisi pass
the crowd began to dispers the english among them cheer and
throw up their hat the dutch with veri sullen face the
commission staff went awai as it had come back to the
build with blue gum in front of it which afterward becam
govern hous that is all except you you start across the
squar alon with a bundl of print proclam in your hand
which evid you had been charg to leav at the variou
public offic
let us follow him i said to mr anscomb he might get into
troubl and want a friend
he nod and we stroll after you unostentati sure
enough you nearli did get into troubl in front of the first
offic door to which you came stood a group of boer two of
whom big fellow drew togeth with the evid intent of
bar your wai
mynheeren you said i prai you to let me pass on the queen
busi
thei took no heed except to draw closer togeth and laugh
insol again you made your request and again thei laugh
then i saw you lift your leg and deliber stamp upon the foot
of on of the boer he drew back with an exclam and for a
moment i believ that he or hi fellow wa go to do someth
violent perhap thei thought better of it or perhap thei saw
us two englishmen behind and notic anscomb pistol at ani
rate you march into the offic triumphant and deliv your
document
neatli done said mr anscomb
rash i said shake my head veri rash well he young
and must be excus
but from that moment i took a great like to you my friend
perhap becaus i wonder whether in your place i should have
been daredevil enough to act in the same wai for you see i am
english and i like to see an englishman hold hi own against
odd and keep up the credit of the countri although of cours
i sympath with the boer who through their own fault were
lose their land without a blow struck as you know well for
you were live near majuba at the time plenti of blow were
struck afterward but of that busi i cannot bear to write
i wonder how it will all work out after i am dead and if i shall
ever learn what happen in the end
now i have onli mention thi busi of the annex and the
part you plai in it becaus it wa on that occas that i
becam acquaint with anscomb for you have noth to do with
thi stori which is about the destruct of the zulu the
accomplish of the vengeanc of zikali the wizard at the kraal
name finish and incident the love affair of two peopl
in which that old wizard took a hand as i did to my sorrow
it happen that mr anscomb had ridden on ahead of hi wagon
which could not arriv at pretoria for a dai or two and as he
found it imposs to get accommod at the european or
elsewher i offer to let him sleep in mine or rather
alongsid in a tent i had he accept and soon we becam veri
good friend befor the dai wa out i discov that he had
serv in a crack cavalri regiment but resign hi commiss
some year befor i ask him why
well he said i came into a good lot of monei on my mother
death and could not see a prospect of ani activ servic while
the regiment wa abroad i like the life well enough but at home
it bore me too much societi for my tast and that sort of
thing also i want to travel noth els realli amus me

dont think so i doubt if i should ever be happili marri i
want too much on doesnt pick up an earthli angel with a
castiron constitut who ador you which ar the bare
necess of marriag under everi bush here i laugh

children

again on your burnt finger
for i wa sure thei had been burnt perhap more than onc how
i never learn for which i am rather sorri for it interest me
to studi burnt finger if thei do not happen to be my own then
we chang the subject
anscomb wagon were delai for a dai or two by a broken axl
or a bog hole i forget which so as i had noth particular
to do until the natal postcart left we spent the time in
wander about pretoria which did not take us long as it wa
but a littl dorp in those dai and chat with all and
sundri also we went up to govern hous as it wa now
call and left card or rather wrote our name in a book for
we had no card be told by on of the staff whom we met that
we should do so an hour later a note arriv ask us both to
dinner that night and tell us veri nice not to mind if we
had no dress thing of cours we had to go anscomb rig up
in my second best cloth that did not fit him in the least as
he wa a much taller man than i am and a black satin bow that he
had bought at becket store togeth with a pair of shini pump
i actual met you my friend for the first time that even
and in troubl too though you mai have forgotten the incid
we had made a mistak about the time of dinner and arriv half
an hour too soon were shown into a long room that open on to
the verandah you were work there be i believ a privat
secretari at the time copi some despatch i think you said
that which gave an account of the annex the room wa lit
by a paraffin lamp behind you for it wa quit dark and the
window wa open or at ani rate unshutt the gentleman who
show us in see that you were veri busi took us to the far
end of the room where we stood talk in the shadow just then
a door open opposit to that which led to the verandah and
through it came hi excel the administr sir theophilu
shepston a stout man of medium height with a veri clever
thought face as i have alwai thought on of the greatest of
african statesmen he did not see us but he caught sight of you
and said testili
ar you mad to which you answer with a laugh
i hope not more than usual sir but why
have i not told you alwai to let down the blind after dark
yet there you sit with your head against the light about the
best target for a bullet that could be imagin
i dont think the boer would troubl to shoot me sir if you
had been here i would have drawn the blind and shut the shutter
too you answer laugh again
go to dress or you will be late for dinner he said still
rather sternli and you went but when you had gone and after we
had been announc to him he smile and ad someth which i
will not repeat to you even now i think it wa about what you
did on the annex dai of which the stori had come to him
i mention thi incid becaus whenev i think of shepston
whom i had known off and on for year in the wai that a hunter
know a promin govern offici it alwai recur to my
mind embodi as it doe hi caution and appreci of danger
deriv from long experi of the countri and the stern he
sometim affect which could never conceal hi love toward hi
friend oh there wa great in thi man although thei did
call him an african talleyrand if it had not been so would
everi nativ from the cape to the zambesi have known and rever
hi name as perhap that of no other white man ha been rever
but i must get on with my tale and leav histor discuss
to other more fit to deal with them
we had a veri pleasant dinner that night although i wa so
asham of my cloth with smart uniform and white ti all
about me and anscomb kept fidget hi feet becaus he wa
suffer agoni from hi new pump which were a size too small
everybodi wa in the best of spirit for from all direct
came the new that the annex wa well receiv and that the
danger of ani troubl had pass awai ah if we had onli known
what the end of it would be
it wa on our wai back to the wagon that i chanc to mention to
anscomb that there wa still a herd of buffalo within a few
dai trek of lydenburg of which i had shot two not a month
befor
ar there by jove he said as it happen i never got a
buffalo alwai i just miss them in on sens or anoth and i
cant leav africa with a pair of bought horn let go there
and shoot some
i shook my head and repli that i had been idl long enough
and must try to make some monei new at which he seem veri
disappoint
look here he said forgiv me for mention it but busi
is busi if youll come you shant be a loser
again i shook my head whereat he look more disappoint than
befor
veri well he exclaim then i must go alon for kill a
buffalo i will that is unless the buffalo kill me in which
case my blood will be on your hand
i dont know why but at that moment there came into my mind a
convict that if he did go alon a buffalo or someth would
kill him and that then i should be sorri all my life
thei ar danger brute much wors than lion i said
and yet you who pretend to have a conscienc would expos me
to their rage unprotect and alon he repli with a twinkl
in hi ey which i could see even by moonlight oh quatermain
how i have been mistaken in your charact

possibl go on a shoot expedit with you just now onli
todai i have heard from natal that my boi is not well and must
undergo an oper which will lai him up for quit six week

postcart from kimberlei whither i had gone to invest what i had
save out of my matabeleland contract in a veri promis
specul whereof todai the promis remain and no more i
had been oblig to leav kimberli in a great hurri befor i
ought inde becaus of the silli bargain which i have just
record of cours i wa sure that i should never see mr
anscomb again especi as i had heard noth of him dure
all thi while and had no reason to suppos that he wa in
africa still i had taken hi 50 and he might come also i
have alwai pride myself upon keep an appoint
the postcart halt with a jerk in front of the european hotel
and i crawl dusti and tire from it interior to find myself
face to face with anscomb who wa smoke a pipe upon the
stoep
hullo quatermain he said in hi pleasant drawl voic
here you ar up to time i have been make bet with these
five gentlemen and he nod at a group of lounger on the
stoep as to whether you would or would not appear i put
ten to on on you in drink therefor you must now consum five
whiski and soda which will save them from consum fifti and
a subsequ appear at the polic court
i laugh and said i would be their debtor to the extent of on
which wa duli produc
after it wa drunk anscomb and i had a chat he said that he
had been to india shot or shot at whatev game he meant to
kill there visit hi relat in england and thenc proceed
to keep hi appoint with me in africa at durban he had
fit himself out in a regal wai with two wagon full team
and some spare oxen and trek to pretoria where he had arriv

district and look for those buffalo
but i said the buffalo probabl long ago depart also
there ha been a war with sekukuni the basuto chief who rule
all that countri which remain undecid although i believ
some kind of a peac ha been patch up thi mai make hunt
in thi neighborhood danger why not try some other ground
to the north of the transvaal for instanc
quatermain he answer i have come all the wai from england
i will not sai to kill but to try to kill buffalo in the
lydenburg district with you if possibl if not without you
and thither i am go if you think it unsaf to accompani me
dont come i will get on as best i can alon or with some other
skill person if i can find on
if you put it like that i shall certainli come i repli
with the proviso that should the buffalo prove to be
nonexist or the pursuit of them imposs we either give up
the trip or go somewher els perhap to the countri at the
back of delagoa bai
agre he said after which we discuss term he pai me
my salari in advanc
on further consider we determin as two were quit
unnecessari for a trip of the sort to leav on of my wagon and
half the cattl in charg of a veri respect man a farmer who
live about five mile from pretoria just over the pass near to
the famou wonderboom tree which is on of the sight of the
place should we need thi wagon it could alwai be sent for
or if we found the lydenburg huntingground which he wa so set
upon visit unproduct or imposs we could return to
pretoria over the highveld and pick it up befor proceed
elsewher
these arrang took us a coupl of dai or so on the third
we start without see you my friend or ani on els that i
knew sinc just at that time everi on seem to be awai from
pretoria you i rememb had by now becom the master of the
high court and were thei inform me at your offic absent on
circuit
the morn of our departur wa particularli love and we
trek awai in the best of spirit as so often happen to
peopl who ar march into troubl of our journei there is
littl to sai as everyth went smoothli so that we arriv at
the edg of the highveld feel as happi as the countri which
ha no histori is report to do our road led us past the
littl mine settlement of pilgrim rest where a number of
adventur spirit most of them english were engag in
wash for gold a job at which i onc took a turn near thi
veri place without ani startl success of the local i need
onli sai that the mountain sceneri is among the most
beauti the hill ar the steepest and the road ar or were
the worst that i have ever travel over in a wagon
howev go softli as the nativ sai we negoti them
without accid and leav pilgrim rest behind us began to
descend toward the lowveld where i wa inform a herd of
buffalo could still be found sinc ow to the war with
sekukuni no on had shot at them of late thi war had been
suspend for a while and the landdrost at pilgrim rest told
me he thought it would be safe to hunt on the border of that
chief countri though he should not care to do so himself
game of the smaller sort began to be plenti about here so not
more than a dozen mile from pilgrim rest we outspan earli
in the afternoon to try to get a blue wildebeest or two for i
had seen the spoor of these creatur in a patch of soft ground
or fail them some other buck accordingli leav the wagon
by a charm stream that wound and gurgl over a bed of
granit we mount our salt hors which were part of
anscomb outfit and set forth rejoic ride through the
scatter thorn and follow the spoor where i could within
half an hour we came to a littl glade there not fifti yard
awai i caught sight of a singl blue wildebeest bull stand in the
shadow of the tree on the further side of the glade and point
out the ugli beast for it is the most grotesqu of all the
antelop to anscomb
off you get i whisper it a love shot you cant miss
it
oh cant i repli anscomb do you shoot
i refus so he dismount give me hi hors to hold and
kneel down solemnli and slowli cover the bull bang went
hi rifl and i saw a bough about a yard abov the wildebeest
fall on to it back off it went like lightn whereon
anscomb let drive with the left barrel of the express almost at
hazard as it seem to me and by some chanc hit it abov the
near forekne break it leg
that wa a good shot he cri jump on to hi hors
excel i answer but what ar you go to do
catch it it is cruel to leav a wound anim and off he
start
of cours i had to follow but the ensu ride remain among the
more pain of my hunt memori we tore through thorn tree
that scratch my face and damag my cloth we struck a patch
of antbear hole into on of which my hors fell so that my
stomach bump against it head we slither down granit
koppi and thi wa the worst of it at the end of each
chapter so to speak alwai caught sight of that accurs bull
which i fondli hope would have vanish into space at length
after half an hour or so of thi game we reach a stretch of
open roll ground and there not fifti yard ahead of us wa
the anim still go like a hare though how it could do so on
three leg i am sure i do not know we cours it like
greyhound till at last anscomb whose hors wa the faster
came alongsid of the exhaust creatur whereon it turn
suddenli and charg
anscomb held out hi rifl in hi right hand and pull the
trigger which as he had forgotten to reload it wa a mere
theatric perform next second there wa such a mixup that
for a while i could not distinguish which wa anscomb which wa
the wildebeest and which the hors thei all seem to be
go round and round in a cloud of dust when thing settl
themselv a littl i discov the hors roll on the ground
anscomb on hi back with hi hand up in an attitud of prayer
and the wildebeest try to make up it mind which of them it
should finish first i settl the poor thing doubt by
shoot it through the heart which i flatter myself wa rather
clever of me under the circumst then i dismount to
examin anscomb who i presum wa done for not a bit of
it there he sat upon the ground blow like a blacksmith
bellow and pant out
what a gloriou gallop i finish it veri well didnt i you
couldnt have made a better shot yourself
ye i answer you finish it veri well as you will find
out if you will take the troubl to open your rifl and count
your cartridg i mai add that if we ar go to hunt togeth
i hope you will never lead me such a fool chase again
he rose open the rifl and saw that it wa empti for although
he had never reload he had thrown out the two cartridg which
he had discharg in the glen
by jingo he said you must have shot it though i could have
sworn that it wa i quatermain ha it ever struck you what a
strang thing is the human imagin
drat the human imagin i answer wipe awai the blood
that wa trickl into my ey from a thorn scratch let look
at your hors if it is lame you will have to ride imagin
back to the wagon which must be six mile awai that is if we can
find it befor dark
sigh out someth about a painfulli practic mind he
obei and when the beast wa prove to be noth more than
blown and a littl bruis made remark as to the inadvis
of dwell on futur evil event which i remind him had
alreadi been better sum up in the new testament
after thi we contempl the carcass of the wildebeest which
it seem a piti to leav to rot just then anscomb who had
move a few yard to the right out of the shadow of an
obstruct tree exclaim
i sai quatermain come here and tell me if i have been knock
silli or if i realli see a quit uncommon kind of hous built in
ancient greek style set in a divin landscap
templ to diana i expect i remark as i join him on the
further side of the tree
i look and rub my ey there about half a mile awai
situat in a bai of the sweep hill and overlook the
measureless expans of bushveld beneath wa a remark hous
at least for those dai and that part of africa to begin with
the situat wa superb it stood on a green and swell mound
behind which wa a wood kloof where ran a stream that at last
precipit itself in a waterfal over a great cliff then in
front wa that gloriou view of the bushveld at which a man
might look for a lifetim and not grow tire stretch awai to
the oliph river and melt at last into the dim line of the
horizon
the hous itself also although not larg wa of a kind new to
me it wa deep but narrow front and befor it were four
column that carri the roof which project so as to form a
wide verandah moreov it seem to be built of marbl which
glisten like snow in the set sun in short in that lone
wilder at ani rate from thi distanc it did look like the
desert shrine of some forgotten god
well im bother i said
so am i answer anscomb to know the name of the lydenburg
district architect whom i should like to emploi though i suspect
it is the surround that make the place look so beauti
hullo here come somebodi but he doesnt look like an
architect he look like a wick baronet disguis as a boer
true enough round a clump of bush appear an unusu look
person mount on a veri good hors he wa tall thin and old
at least he had a long white beard which suggest ag although
hi figur so far as it could be seen beneath hi rough cloth
seem vigor hi face wa clean cut and handsom with a
rather hook nose and hi ey were grei but as i saw when he
came up to us somewhat bloodshot at the corner hi gener
aspect wa refin and benevol and as soon as he open hi
mouth i perceiv that he wa a person of gentl breed
and yet there wa someth about him someth in hi
atmospher so to speak that i did not like befor we part
that even i felt sure that in on wai or anoth he wa a
wrongdoer not straight also that he had a violent temper
he rode up to us and ask in a pleasant voic although the
manner of hi question which wa put in bad dutch wa not
pleasant
who gave you leav to shoot on our land
i did not know that ani leav wa requir it is not customari
in these part i answer polit in english moreov thi
buck wa wound mile awai
oh he exclaim in the same tongu that make a differ
though i expect it wa still on our land for we have a lot it
is cheap about here then after studi a littl he ad
apologet you mustnt think me strang but the fact is my
daughter hate thing to be kill near the hous which is why
there so much game about
then prai make her our apolog said anscomb and sai that
it shall not happen again
he stroke hi long beard and look at us for by now he had
dismount then said
might i ask you gentlemen your name
certainli i repli i am allan quatermain and my friend is
the hon mauric anscomb
he start and said
of allan quatermain of cours i have heard the nativ told me
that you were trek to those part and if you sir ar on
of lord mountford son oddli enough i think i must have known
your father in my youth inde i serv with him in the
guard
how veri strang said anscomb he dead now and my brother
is lord mountford do you like life here better than that in the
guard i am sure i should
both of them have their advantag he answer evas of
which if as i think you ar also a soldier you can judg for
yourself but wont you come up to the hous my daughter heda
is awai and my partner mr rodd as he mention thi name i
saw a blue vein which show abov hi cheek bone swell as
though under pressur of some secret emot is a retir sort
of a maninde some might think him sulki until thei came to
know him still we can make you comfort and even give you a
decent bottl of wine
no thank you veri much i answer we must get back to the
wagon or our servant will think that we have come to grief
perhap you will accept the wildebeest if it is of ani us to
you
veri well he said in a voic that suggest regret struggl
with relief to the buck he made no allus perhap becaus he
consid that it wa alreadi hi own properti do you know
your wai i believ your wagon is camp out there to the east
by what we call the granit stream if you follow thi kaffir
path and he point to a track near by it will take you quit
close
where doe the path run to i ask there ar no kraal
about ar there
oh to the templ as my daughter call our hous my partner
and i ar labour agent we recruit nativ for the kimberlei
mine he said in explan ad where do you propos to
shoot
i told him
isnt that rather a riski district he said i think that
sekukuni will soon be give more troubl although there is a
truce between him and the english still he might send a
regiment to raid that wai
i wonder how our friend knew so much of sekukuni possibl
intent but onli answer that i wa accustom to deal with
nativ and did not fear them
ah he said well you know your own busi best but if
you should get into ani difficulti make straight for thi place
the basuto will not interfer with you here
again i wonder why the basuto should look upon thi particular
spot as sacr but think it wisest to ask no question i
onli answer
thank you veri much well bear your invit in mind mr
marnham
marnham i repeat after him goodby and mani thank for
your kind
on question broke in anscomb if you will not think me
rude what is the name of the architect who design that most
romanticlook hous of your which seem to be built of
marbl
my daughter design it or at least i think she copi it from
some old draw of a ruin also it is marbl there a whole
hill of the stuff not a hundr yard from the door so it wa
cheaper to us than anyth els i hope you will come and see
it on your wai back though it is not as fine as it appear from
a distanc it would be veri pleasant after all these year to
talk to an english gentleman again
then we part i rather offend becaus he did not seem to
includ me in the descript he call after us
stick close to the path through the patch of big tree for the
ground is rather swampi there and it get dark
present we came to the place he mention where the timber
although scatter wa quit larg for south africa of the
yellowwood speci and interspers wherev the ground wa dry
with huge euphorbia of which the tall fingerlik growth and
sad grei colour look unreal and ghostlik in the wane
light follow the advic given to us we rode in singl file
along the narrow path fear lest otherwis we should tumbl
into some bog hole until we came to higher land cover with the
scatter thorn of the countri
did that bush give you ani particular impress ask
anscomb a minut or two later
ye i answer it gave me the impress that we might catch
fever there see the mist that li over it and turn in my
saddl i point with the rifl in my hand to what look like a
mass of cotton wool over which without permeat it hung the
last red glow of sunset produc a curiou and inde rather
unearthli effect i expect that thousand of year ago there
wa a lake yonder which is why tree grow so big in the rich
soil
you ar curious mundan quatermain he answer i ask you
of spiritu impress and you dilat to me of geolog
format and the growth of timber you felt noth in the
spiritu line
i felt noth except a chill i answer for i wa tire and
hungri what the devil ar you drive at
have you got that flask of holland about you quatermain
oh those ar the spirit you ar refer to i remark with
sarcasm as i hand it to him
he took a good pull and repli
not at all except in the sens that bad spirit requir good
spirit to correct them as the bibl teach to come to
fact he ad in a chang voic i have never been in a
place that depress me more than that thrice accurs patch of
bush
why did it depress you i ask studi him as well as i
could in the fade light to tell the truth i fear lest he
had knock hi head when the wildebeest upset him and wa
suffer from delai concuss
cant tell you quatermain i dont look like a crimin do i
well i enter those tree feel a fairli honest man and i
came out of them feel like a murder it wa as though
someth terribl had happen to me there it wa as though i
had kill someon there ugh and he shiver and took anoth
pull at the holland
what bosh i said besid even if it were to come true i
am sorri to sai iv kill lot of men in the wai of busi
and thei dont bother me overmuch
did you ever kill on to win a woman
certainli not why that would be murder how can you ask me
such a thing but i have kill sever to win cattl i
reflect aloud rememb my expedit with saduko against
the chief bangu and some other incid in my career
i appreci the differ quatermain if you kill for cow
it is justifi homicid if you kill for women it is murder
ye i repli that is how it seem to work out in africa
you see women ar higher in the scale of creation than cow
therefor crime commit for their sake ar enorm greater
than those commit for cow which just make the differ
between justifi homicid and murder
good lord what an argument he exclaim and relaps into
silenc had he been accustom to nativ and their wai he
would have understood the point much better than he did though i
admit it is difficult to explain
in due cours we reach the wagon without further troubl
while we were shield our pipe after an excel supper i
ask anscomb hi impress of mr marnham
queer cove i think he answer been a gentleman too and
still keep the manner which isnt strang if he is on of the
marnham for thei ar a good famili i wonder he mention
have serv with my father
it slip out of him men who live a lot alon ar apt to be
surpris into sai thing thei regret afterward as i notic
he did but why do you wonder
becaus as it happen although i have onli just recal it my
father us to tell some stori about a man name marnham in hi
regiment i cant rememb the detail but it had to do with
card when high stake were be plai for and with the
strike of a superior offic in the quarrel that ensu as a
result of which the striker wa request to send in hi paper
it mai not have been the same man
perhap not for i believ that more than on marnham serv in
that regiment but i rememb my father sai by wai of excus
for the person concern that he had a most ungovern temper
i think he ad that he left the countri and took servic in
some armi on the contin i should rather like to clear the
thing up
it isnt probabl that you will for even if you should ever
meet thi marnham again i fanci you would find he held hi
tongu about hi acquaint with your father
i wonder what miss heda is like went on anscomb after a
paus i am curiou to see a girl who design a hous on the
model of an ancient ruin
well you wont for she awai somewher besid we ar
look for buffalo not girl which is a good thing as thei ar
less danger
i spoke thu decis becaus i had taken a dislik to mr
marnham and everyth to do with him and did not wish to
encourag the idea of further meet
no never i suppos and yet i feel as though i were certainli
destin to see that accurs yellowwood swamp again
nonsens i repli as i rose to turn in ah if i had but
known
chapter iii
the hunter hunt
while i wa take off my boot i heard a nois of jabber in
some nativ tongu which i took to be sisutu and not wish to
go to the troubl of put them on again call to the driver
of the wagon to find out what it wa thi man wa a cape coloni
kaffir a fingo i think with a touch of hottentot in him he
wa an excel driver inde i do not think i have ever seen a
better and by no mean a bad shot among european he rejoic
in the name of footsack a boer dutch term which is gener
address to troublesom dog and mean get out to tell the
truth had i been hi master he would have got out as i
suspect him of drink and gener did not altogeth trust
him anscomb howev wa fond of him becaus he had shown
courag in some hunt adventur in matabeleland i think it wa
at the shoot of that veri darkcolour lion whose skin had
been the mean of make us acquaint nearli two year befor
inde he said that on thi occas footsack had save hi life
though from all that i could gather i do not think thi wa quit
the case also the man who had been on mani hunt trip with
sportsmen could talk dutch well and english enough to make
himself understood and therefor wa us
he went as i bade him and come back present told me that a
parti of basuto about thirti in number who were return from
kimberlei where thei had been at work in the mine under the
leadership of a bastard name karl ask leav to camp by the
wagon for the night as thei were afraid to go on to tampel in
the dark
at first i could not make out what tampel wa as it did not
sound like a nativ name then i rememb that mr marnham had
spoken of hi hous as be call the templ of which of
cours tampel wa a corrupt also that he said he and hi
partner were labour agent
why ar thei afraid i ask
becaus baa thei sai that thei must go through a wood in a
swamp which thei think is haunt by spook and thei much
afraid of spook that is of ghost
what spook i ask
dont know baa thei sai spook of some on who ha been
kill
rubbish i repli tell them to go and catch the spook we
dont want a lot of noisi fellow howl chanti here all
night
then it wa that anscomb broke in in hi humor rather
drawl voic
how can you be so hardheart quatermain after the
supernatur terror which as i told you i experienc in that
veri place i wouldnt condemn a kick mule to go through it in
thi dark let the poor devil stai i daresai thei ar
tire
so i gave in and present saw their fire begin to burn
through the end canva of the wagon which wa unlac becaus the
night wa hot also later on i woke up about midnight i think
and heard voic talk on of which i reflect sleepili
sound veri like that of footsack
wake veri earli as is my habit i peep out of the wagon and
through the morn mist perceiv footsack in convers with a
particularli villainouslook person i at onc conclud thi
must be karl evid a bastard compound of about fifteen
part of variou nativ blood to on of white who to add to
hi attract wa deepli scar with smallpox and possess a
realli alarm squint it seem to me that footsack hand to
thi man someth that look suspici like a bottl of
squarefac gin wrap up in dri grass and that the man hand
back to footsack some small object which he put in hi mouth
now i wonder to myself what is there of valu that on who
doe not eat sweet would stow awai in hi mouth gold coin
perhap or a quid of tobacco or a stone gold wa too much to
pai for a bottl of gin tobacco wa too littl but how about
the stone what stone who want stone then suddenli i
rememb that these peopl were said to come from kimberlei
and whistl to myself still i did noth princip becaus
the mist wa still so dens that although i could see the men
face i could not clearli see the articl which thei pass to
each other about two feet lower where it still lai veri thickli
and to bring ani accus against a nativ which he can prove
to be fals is apt to destroi author so i held my tongu and
wait my chanc it did not come at onc for befor i wa
dress those basuto had depart togeth with their leader
karl for now that the sun wa up thei no longer fear the
haunt bush
it came later thu we were trek along between the thorn
upon a level and easi track which enabl the driver footsack to
sit upon the voorkiss or drive box of the wagon leav the
lad who is call the voorloop to lead the oxen anscomb wa
ride parallel to the wagon in the hope of kill some
guineafowl for the pot though a veri poor shot with a rifl he
wa good with a shotgun i who did not care for thi small
game wa seat smoke by the side of footsack who i note
smelt of gin and gener show sign of dissip suddenli
i said to him
show me that diamond which the bastard karl gave you thi
morn in payment for the bottl of your master drink
it wa a bow drawn at a ventur but the effect of the shot wa
remark had i not caught it the long bamboo whip footsack
held would have fallen to the ground while he collaps in hi
seat like a man who ha receiv a bullet in hi stomach
baa he gasp baa how did you know
i knew i repli grandli in the same wai that i know
everyth show me the diamond
baa he said it wa not the baa anscomb gin it wa some
i bought in pilgrim rest
i have count the bottl in the case and know veri well whose
gin it wa i repli ambigu for the reason that i had
done noth of the sort show me the diamond
footsack fumbl about hi person hi hair hi waistcoat
pocket and even hi moocha and ultim from somewher
produc a stone which he hand to me i look at it and from
the puriti of colour and size judg it to be a diamond worth
200 or possibl more after care examin i put it into
my pocket sai
thi is the price of your master gin and therefor belong to
him as much as it doe to anybodi now if you want to keep out
of troubl tell mewhenc came it into the hand of that man
karl
baa repli footsack trembl all over how do i know he
and the rest have been work at the mine i suppos he found
it there
inde and did he find other of the same sort
i think so baa at least he said that he had been bui
bottl of gin with such stone all the wai down from kimberlei
karl is a great drunkard baa as i am sure who have known him
for year
that is not all i remark keep my ey fix on him
what els did he sai
he said baa that he wa veri much afraid of return to the
baa marnham whom the kaffir call whitebeard with onli a few
stone left
why wa he afraid
becaus the baa whitebeard he who dwell at tampel is he
sai a veri angri man if he think himself cheat and karl is
afraid lest he should kill him as anoth wa kill he whose
spook haunt the wood through which those silli peopl fear to
pass last night
who wa kill and who kill him i ask
baa i dont know repli footsack collaps into sullen
silenc in a wai that kaffir have when suddenli thei realiz
that thei have said too much nor did i press the matter
further have learn enough
what had i learn thi that messr marnham rodd were
illicit diamond buyer idb as thei ar call who had
cunningli situat themselv at a great distanc from the scene
of oper practic beyond the reach of civil law
probabl thei were engag also in other nefari deal with
kaffir such as suppli them with gun wherewith to make war
upon the white sekukuni had been fight us recent so that
there would be a veri brisk market for rifl thi too would
account for marnham appar knowledg of that chief plan
possibl howev he had no knowledg and onli made a pretenc
of it to keep us out of the countri
later on i confid the whole stori and my suspicion to
anscomb who wa much interest
what picturesqu scoundrel he exclaim we realli ought to
go back to the templ i have alwai long to meet some real
live idb
it is probabl that you have done that alreadi without know
it for the rest if you wish to visit that den of iniqu you
must do so alon
wouldnt white sepulchr be a better term especi as it
seem to cover dead men bone he repli in hi frivol
manner
then i ask him what he wa go to do about footsack and the
bottl of gin which he counter by ask me what i wa go
to do with that diamond
give it to you as footsack master i said suit the action
to the word i dont wish to be mix up in doubt
transact
then follow a long argument as to who wa the real owner of the
stone which end in it be hidden awai be produc if call
for and in footsack who ought have had a round dozen receiv
a scold from hi master coupl with the threat that if he
stole more gin he would be hand over to a magistratewhen we
met on
on the follow dai we reach the hot lowli veld which the
herd of buffalo wa said to inhabit next morn howev when
we were make readi to begin hunt a basuto kaffir appear
who on be question said that he wa on of sekukuni
peopl sent to thi district to look for two lost oxen i did
not believ thi stori think it more probabl that he wa a
spy but ask him whether in hi hunt for oxen he had come
across buffalo
he repli that he had a herd of thirtytwo of them count
the calv but that thei were over the oliph river about
fiveandtwenti mile awai in a vallei between some outli
hill and the rug rang of mountain beyond which wa
situat sekukuni town moreov in proof of hi stori he
show me spoor of the beast head in that direct which wa
quit a week old
now for my part as i did not think it wise to get too near to
sekukuni i should have given them up and gone to hunt someth
els anscomb howev wa of a differ opinion and plead
hard that we should follow them thei were the onli herd within
a hundr mile he said if inde there were ani other thi
side of the lebombo mountain as i still demur he
suggest in the nicest possibl manner that if i thought the
busi riski i should camp somewher with the wagon while he
went on with footsack to look for the buffalo i answer that i
wa well us to risk which in a sens were my trade and that
as he wa more or less in my charg i wa think of him not of
myself who wa quit prepar to follow the buffalo not onli to
sekukuni mountain but over them then fear that he had
hurt my feel he apolog and offer to go elsewher if i
like the upshot wa that we decid to trek to the oliph
river camp there and explor the bush on the other side on
horseback never go so far from the wagon that we could not
reach it again befor nightfal
thi then we did outspan that even by the hot but
beauti river which wa still haunt by a few hippopotamu and
mani crocodil on of which we shot befor turn in next
morn have breakfast off cold guineafowl we mount
cross the river by a ford that wa quit as deep as i like to
which the kaffir path led us and leav footsack with the two
other boi in charg of the wagon began to hunt for the buffalo
in the rather swampi bush that stretch from the further bank to
the slope of the first hill eight or ten mile awai i did not
much expect to find them as the basuto had said that thei had
gone over these hill but either he li or thei had move back
again
not half a mile from the river bank just as i wa about to
dismount to stalk a fine waterbuck of which i caught sight
stand among some coars grass and bush my ey fell upon
buffalo spoor that from it appear i knew could not be more
than a few hour old evid the beast had been feed here
dure the night and at dawn had move awai to sleep in the dry
bush nearer the hill beckon to anscomb who fortun
had not seen the waterbuck at which he would certainli have
fire therebi perhap frighten the buffalo i show him the
spoor that we at onc start to follow
soon it led us into other spoor that of a whole herd of thirti
or forti beast inde which made our task quit easi at least
till we came to harder ground for the anim had gone a long
wai an hour or more later when we were about seven mile from
the river i perceiv ahead of us for we were now almost at the
foot of the hill a cool and denselywood kloof
that is where thei will be i said now come on carefulli and
make no nois
we rode to the wide mouth of the kloof where the sign of the
buffalo were numer and fresh dismount and ti our hors
to a thorn so as to approach them silent on foot we had not
gone two hundr yard through the bush when suddenli about fifti
pace awai stand broadsid on in the shadow between two
tree i saw a splendid old bull with a tremend pair of horn
shoot i whisper to anscomb you will never get a better
chanc it is the sentinel of the herd
he knelt down hi face quit white with excit and cover
the bull with hi express
keep cool i whisper again and aim behind the shoulder
halfwai down
i dont think he understood me for at that moment off went the
rifl he hit the beast somewher as i heard the bullet clap
but not fatal for it turn and lumber off up the kloof
appar unhurt whereon he sent the second barrel after it a
clean miss thi time then of a sudden all about us appear
buffalo that had i suppos been sleep invis to us
these with snort and bellow rush off toward the river for
have their sens about them thei had no mind to be trap in
the kloof i could onli manag a shot at on of them a larg
and longhorn cow which i knock over quit dead if i had
fire again it would have been but to wound a thing i hate the
whole busi wa over in a minut we went and look at my
dead cow which i had caught through the heart
it cruel to kill these thing i said for i dont know what
us we ar go to make of them and thei must love life as much
as we do
well cut the horn off said anscomb
you mai if you like i answer but you will find it a tough
job with a sheath knife
ye i think that shall be the task of the worthi footsack
tomorrow he repli meanwhil let us go and finish off my
bull as footsack co mai as well bring home two pair of horn
as on
i look at the dens bush and know someth of the habit
of wound buffalo reflect that it would be a nasti job
still i said noth becaus if i hesit i knew he would
want to go alon so we start evid the beast had been
badli hit for the blood spoor wa easi to follow yet it had
been abl to retreat up to the end of the kloof that termin
in a cliff over which trickl a stream of water here it wa
not more than a hundr pace wide and on either side of it were
other precipit cliff as we went from on of these a
warhorn such as the basuto us wa blown although i heard
it oddli enough i paid no attent to it at the time be
utterli intent upon the busi in hand
follow a wound buffalo bull up a treeclad and stoni kloof
is no game for children as these beast have a habit of
return on their track and then rush out to gore you so i
went on with everi sens alert keep anscomb well behind me
as it happen our bull had either been knock silli or
inherit no guil from hi parent when he found he could go
no further he stop wait behind a bush and when he saw us
he charg in a simpl and primit fashion i let anscomb
fire as i wish him to have the credit of kill it all to
himself but somehow or other he manag to miss both barrel
then troubl be immin i let drive as the beast lower
it head and wa lucki enough to break it spine to shoot at
the head of a buffalo is useless so that it roll over quit
dead at our feet
you have got a magnific pair of horn i said contempl
the fallen giant
ye answer anscomb with a twinkl of hi humor ey
and if it hadnt been for you i think that i should have got
them in more sens than on
as the word pass hi lip some missil from it peculiar
sound i judg it wa the leg off an iron pot hurtl past my
head fire evid from a smoothbor gun with a larg charg
of bad powder then i rememb the warhorn and all that it
meant
off you go i said we ar ambush by kaffir
we were inde for as we tail down that kloof from the top of
both cliff abov us came a continu but luckili illdirect
fire leadcoat stone pot leg and bullet whir and
whistl all round us yet until the last just when we were
reach the tree to which we had ti our hors quit
harmlessli then suddenli i saw anscomb begin to limp still
he manag to run on and mount though i observ that he did not
put hi right foot into the stirrup
what the matter i ask as we gallop off
shot through the instep i think he answer with a laugh
but it doesnt hurt a bit
i expect it will later i repli meanwhil thank god it
wasnt at the top of the kloof thei wont catch us on the
hors which thei never thought of kill first
thei ar go to try though look behind you
i look and saw twenti or thirti men emerg from the mouth of
the kloof in pursuit
no time to stop to get those horn he said with a sigh
no i answer unless you ar particularli anxiou to sai
goodby to the world pin over a broken antheap in the sun
or someth pleasant of the sort
then we rode on in silenc i think what a fool i had been
first to allow myself to be overrul by anscomb and cross the
river and secondli not to have taken warn from that warhorn
we could not go veri fast becaus of the difficult and swampi
natur of the ground also the great heat of the dai told on the
hors thu it came about that when we reach the ford we were
not more than ten minut ahead of our activ pursuer good
runner everi on of them and accustom to the countri i
suppos that thei had order to kill or captur us at ani cost
for instead of give up the chase as i hope thei would thei
stuck to us in surpris fashion
we splash through the river and luckili on the further bank
were met by footsack who had seen us come and guess that
someth wa wrong
inspan i shout to him and be quick about it if you want to
see tomorrow light the basuto ar after us
off he went like a shot hi face quit green with fear
now i said to anscomb as we let our hors take a drink for
which thei were mad we have got to hold thi ford until the
wagon is readi or those devil will get us after all dismount
and ill tie up the hors
he did so with some difficulti and at my suggest while i
made the beast fast cut the lace of hi boot which wa full of
blood and soak hi wound foot that i had no time to
examin in the cool water these thing done i help him to
the rear of a thorn tree which wa thick enough to shield most of
hi bodi and took my own stand behind a similar thorn at a
distanc of a few pace
present the basuto appear trot along close togeth
whereon anscomb who wa seat behind the tree fire both
barrel of hi express at them at a rang of about two hundr
yard it wa a foolish thing to do first becaus he miss
them clean for he had overestim the rang and the bullet
went abov their head and secondli becaus it caus them to
scatter and made them care wherea had thei come on in a lump
we could have taught them a lesson howev i said noth as i
knew that reproach would onli make him nervou down went
those scoundrel on to their hand and knee and take cover
behind stone and bush on the further bank began to fire at
us for thei were all arm with gun of on sort and anoth
and there wa onli about a hundr yard of water between us as
thei effect thi manoeuvr i am glad to sai i wa abl to get
two of them while anscomb i think wound anoth
after thi our posit grew quit warm for as i have said the
thorn trunk were not veri broad and three or four of the
nativ who had probabl been hunter were by no mean bad
shot though the rest of them fire wildli anscomb in poke
hi head round the tree to shoot had hi hat knock off by a
bullet while a slug went through the lappet of my coat then a
wors thing happen either by chanc or design anscomb
hors wa struck in the neck and fell struggl whereon my
beast grow frighten broke it riem and gallop to the
wagon that is where i ought to have left them at first onli i
thought that we might need them to make a bolt on or to carri
anscomb if he could not walk
quit a long while went by befor glanc behind me i saw
that the oxen that had been graze at a littl distanc had at
length arriv and were be inspan in furiou hast the
basuto saw it also and fear lest we should escap
determin to try to end the busi suddenli thei leapt from
their cover and with more courag than i should have expect of
them rush into the river propos to storm us which to
speak truth i think thei would have done had i not been a fairli
quick shot
as it wa find that thei were lose too heavili from our
fire thei retreat in a hurri leav their dead behind them
and even a wound man who wa cling to a rock he poor
wretch wa in mortal terror lest we should shoot him again
which i had not the heart to do although as hi leg wa
shatter abov the knee by an express bullet it might have been
true kind again and again he call out for merci sai
that he onli attack us becaus hi chief who had been warn
of our come by the white man order him to take our gun
and cattl
what white man i shout speak or i shoot
there wa no answer for at thi moment he faint from loss of
blood and vanish beneath the water then anoth basuto i
suppos he wa their captain but do not know for he wa hidden
in some bush call out
do not think that you shall escap white men there ar mani
more of our peopl come and we will kill you in the night when
you cannot see to shoot us
at thi moment too footsack shout that the wagon wa
inspan and readi now i hesit what to do if we made for
the wagon which must be veri slowli becaus of anscomb
wound foot we had to cross seventi or eighti yard of rise
ground almost devoid of cover if on the other hand we stai
where we were till nightfal a shot might catch on of us or
other basuto might arriv and rush us there wa also a third
possibl that our terrifi servant might trek off and leav
us in order to save their own live which verili i believ thei
would have done not be of zulu blood i put the problem to
anscomb who shook hi head and look at hi foot then he
produc a lucki penni which he carri in hi pocket and said
let us invok the fate head we run like hero tail we
stai here like hero and he spun the penni while i stare at
him openmouth and not without admir
never i thought to myself had thi primit method of cut
a gordian knot been resort to in such strang and urgent
circumst
head it is he said coolli now my boi do you run and ill
crawl after you if i dont arriv you know my peopl
address and i bequeath to you all my african belong in
memori of a most pleasant trip
dont plai the fool i repli sternli come put your right
arm round my neck and hop on your left leg as you never hop
befor
then we start and realli our transit wa quit live for
all those basuto began what for them wa rapid fire i think
howev that their best shot must have fallen for not a bullet
touch us although befor we got out of their rang on or two
went veri near
there said anscomb as a last amaz hop brought him to the
wagon rail there you see how wise it is give provid a
chanc sometim
in the shape of a lucki penni i grumbl as i hoist him up
certainli for why should not provid inhabit a penni as much
as it doe ani other mundan thing oh my dear quatermain have
you never been taught to look to the penc and let the rest take
care of itself
stop talk rubbish and look to your foot for the wagon is
start i repli
then off we went at a good round trot for never have i seen oxen
more scientif driven than thei were by footsack and hi
friend on thi occas or a greater pace got out of them as
soon as we reach a fairli level piec of ground i made anscomb
lie down on the cartel of the wagon and examin hi wound as
well as circumst would allow i found that the bullet or
whatev the missil mai have been had gone through hi right
instep just beneath the big sinew but so far as i could judg
without injur ani bone there wa noth to be done except
rub in some carbol ointment which fortun he had in hi
medicin chest and bind up the wound as best i could with a
clean handkerchief after which i ti a towel that wa not
clean over the whole foot
by thi time even wa come on so we at of such as we had
with us which we need badli enough without stop the
wagon i rememb that it consist of chees and hard biscuit
at dark we were oblig to halt a littl by a stream until the
moon rose which fortun she did veri soon as she wa onli
just past her full as soon as she wa up we start again and
with a breath space or two trek all that night which i
spent seat on the after part of the wagon and keep a sharp
look out while notwithstand the rough of the road and
hi hurt anscomb slept like a child upon the cartel insid
i wa veri tire so tire that the fear of surpris wa the onli
thing that kept me awak and i recal reflect in a stupid
kind of wai that it seem alwai to have been my lot in life to
watch thu in on sens or anoth while other slept
the night pass somehow without anyth happen and at dawn
we halt for a while to water the oxen which we did with
bucket and let them eat what grass thei could reach from their
yoke sinc we did not dare to outspan them just as we were
start on again the voortrekk whom i had set to watch at a
littl distanc ran up with hi ey bulg out of hi head
and report that he had seen a basuto with an assegai hang
about in the bush as though to keep touch with us after which
we delai no more
all that dai we blunder on thrash the weari cattl that at
everi halt tri to lie down and by nightfal came to the
outspan near to the hous call the templ where we had met the
kaffir return from the diamond field thi journei we had
accomplish in exactli half the time it had taken on the outward
trip here we were oblig to stop as our team must have rest
and food so we outspan and slept that night without much
fear sinc i thought it most improb that the basuto would
attempt to follow us so far as we were now within a dai trek
of pilgrim rest whither we propos to proce on the morrow
but that is just where i made a mistak
chapter iv
doctor rodd
i did get a littl sleep that night with on ey open but
befor dawn i wa up again see to the feed of our remain
hors with some meali that we carri and other matter the
oxen we had been oblig to unyok that thei might fill
themselv with grass and water sinc otherwis i fear that we
should never get them on to their feet again as it wa the
poor brute were so tire that some of them could scarc eat
and all lai down at the first opportun
have awaken footsack and the other boi that thei might be
readi to take advantag of the light when it came for i wa
anxiou to be awai i drank a nip of holland and water and at a
biscuit make anscomb do the same coffe would have been
more accept but i thought it wiser not to light a fire for
fear of show our whereabout
now a faint glimmer in the east told me that the dawn wa come
just by the wagon grew a fairsiz greenleav tree and as it
wa quit easi to climb even by starlight up it i went so as to
get abov the ground mist and take a look round befor we
trek present the sky grew pearli and light began to
gather then the edg of the sun appear throw long level
rai across the world everywher the mist lai dens as cotton
wool except at on spot about a mile behind us where there wa a
littl hill or rather a wave of the ground over which we had
trek upon the preced even the top of thi rise wa
abov mist level and on it no tree grew becaus the granit
came to the surfac have discov noth i call to the
boi to drive up the oxen some of which had risen and were
eat again and prepar to descend from my tree
as i did so out of the corner of my ey i caught sight of
someth that glitter far awai so far that it would onli have
attract the notic of a train hunter ye someth wa
shine on the brow of the rise of which i have spoken i stare
at it through my glass and saw what i had fear to see a
bodi of nativ wa cross the rise and the glitter wa caus
by the rai of dawn strike on their spear and gunbarrel
i came down out of that tree like a frighten wild cat and ran
to the wagon think hard as i went the basuto were after
us mean to attack as soon as there wa suffici light in
ten minut or less thei would be here there wa no time to
inspan the oxen and even if there had been stiff and weari as
the beast were we should be overtaken befor we had gone a
hundr yard on that bad road what then wa to be done run
for it it wa imposs anscomb could not run my ey fell
upon the hors munch the last of hi meali
footsack i said as quietli as i could never mind about
inspan yet but saddl up the hors be quick now
he look at me doubtfulli but obei have seen noth if
he had seen i knew that he would have been off i nip round
to the end of the wagon call to the other two boi to let the
oxen be a while and come to me
now anscomb i said hand out the rifl and cartridg
dont stop to ask question but do what i tell you thei ar on
the rack by your side so now put on your revolv and let me
help you down man dont forget your hat
he obei quickli enough and present wa stand on on leg
by my side look cramp and totteri
the basuto ar on us i said
he whistl and remark someth about chapter no 2
footsack i call bring the hors here the baa wish to
ride a littl to eas hi leg
he did so stop a moment to pull the second girth tight
then we help anscomb into the saddl
which wai he ask
i look at the long slope in front of us it wa steep and bad
go anscomb might get up it on the hors befor the kaffir
overtook us but it wa extrem problemat if we could do
so i might perhap if i mount behind him and the hors could
bear us both which wa doubt but how about our poor
servant he saw the doubt upon my face and said in hi quiet
wai
you mai rememb that our whitebeard friend told us to make
straight for hi place in case of ani difficulti with the
basuto it seem to have arisen
i know he did i answer but i cannot make up my mind which
is the more danger marnham or the basuto i rather think
that he set them on to us
it is imposs to solv problem at thi hour of the morn
quatermain and there is no time to toss so i vote for the
templ
it seem our best chanc at ani rate that your choic so
let go
then i sang out to the kaffir the basuto ar on us we go to
tampel for refug run
my word thei did run i never saw athlet make better time
over the first quarter of a mile we ran too or at least the
hors did i hang on to the stirrup and anscomb hold both
the rifl beneath hi arm but the beast wa tire also blown
out with that morn feed of meali so our progress wa not
veri fast when we were about two hundr yard from the wagon i
look back and saw the basuto begin to arriv thei saw us
also and utter a sort of whistl war cry start in
pursuit
after thi we had quit an interest time i scrambl on to
the hors behind anscomb whereon that intellig anim
feel the doubl weight reduc it pace proportion to a
slow trippl inde out of which it could not be persuad to
move so i slip off again over it tail and we went on as
befor meanwhil the basuto veri activ fellow were come
up by thi time the yellowwood grove in the swamp of which i
have alreadi written wa close to us and it becam quit a
question which of us would get there first i mai mention that
footsack co had alreadi attain it friendli shelter
anscomb kick the hors with hi sound heel and i thump it
with my fist therebi persuad it to a hand gallop
as we reach the outli tree of the wood the first basuto a
lank fellow with a mouth like a rat trap arriv and threw an
assegai at us which pass between anscomb back and my nose
then he close and tri to stab with anoth assegai i could
do noth but anscomb show himself clever than i expect
drop the rein he drew hi pistol and manag to send a
bullet through that child of natur head so that he went down
like a stone
and you tell me i am a bad shot he drawl
it wa a fluke i gasp for even in these circumst truth
would prevail
wait and youll see he repli recock the revolv
as a matter of fact there wa no need for more shoot sinc at
the verg of the swamp the basuto pull up i do not think
that the death of their companion caus them to do thi for
thei seem to take no notic of him it wa as though thei had
reach some boundari which thei knew it would not be law for
them to pass thei simpli stop took the dead man assegai
and shield from the bodi and walk quietli back toward the
wagon leav him where he lai the hors stop also or
rather proceed at a walk
there exclaim anscomb did i not tell you i had a
presenti that i should kill a man in thi accurs wood
ye i said as soon as i had recov my breath but you
mix up a woman with the matter and i dont see on
that true he repli i hope we shant meet her later
then we went on as quickli as we could which wa not veri fast
for i fear lest the basuto should chang their mind and
follow us as the risk of thi becam less our spirit rose
sinc if we had lost the wagon and the oxen at least we had
save our live which wa almost more than we could have
expect in the circumst at last we came to that glade
where we had kill the wildebeest not a week befor there lai
it skeleton pick clean by the great brown kite that frequent
the bushveld some of which still sat about in the tree
well i suppos we must go on to tampel said anscomb rather
faintli for i could see that hi wound wa give him a good
deal of pain
as he spoke from round the tree whenc he had first emerg
appear mr marnham ride the same hors and wear the same
cloth the onli differ between hi two entri wa that
the first took place in the late even and the second in the
earli morn
so here you ar again he said cheerfulli
ye i answer and it is strang to meet you at the same
spot were you expect us
not more than i expect mani thing he repli with a shrewd
glanc at me ad i alwai rise with the sun and think
that i heard a shot fire in the distanc came to see what wa
happen the basuto attack you at daybreak did thei not
thei did but how did you know that mr marnham
your servant told me i met them run to the hous look
veri frighten you ar wound mr anscomb
ye a coupl of dai ago on the border of sekukuni countri
where the nativ tri to murder us
ah he repli without surpris i warn you the trip wa
danger did i not well come on home where my partner rodd
who luckili ha had medic experi will attend to you mr
quatermain can tell me the stori as we go
so we went on up the long slope i relat our adventur to
which mr marnham listen without comment
i expect that the kaffir will have loot the wagon and be on
the wai home with your oxen by now he said when i had finish
ar you not afraid that thei will follow us here i ask
oh no mr quatermain we do busi with these peopl also
thei sometim come to be doctor by rodd when thei ar sick so
thi place is sacr ground to them thei stop hunt you
when thei got to the yellowwood swamp where our land begin did
thei not
ye but now i want to hunt them can you give me ani help
those oxen ar tire out and footsor so we might be abl to
catch them up
he shook hi head we have veri few peopl here and by the
time that you could get assist from the camp at barberton if
the command is abl and will to give you ani which i
rather doubt thei will be far awai moreov he ad
drop hi voic let us come to an understand you ar
most welcom to ani help or hospit that i can offer but if
you wish to do more fight i must ask you to go elsewher as
i have told you we ar peac men who trade with these peopl
and do not wish to be involv in a quarrel with them which
might expos us to attack or bring us into troubl with the
british govern which ha annex but not conquer their
countri do i make myself clear
perfectli while we ar with you we will do noth but
afterward we hold ourselv at liberti to act as we think best
quit so meanwhil i hope that you and mr anscomb will make
yourselv comfort with us for as long as you like
in my own mind i came to the conclus that thi would be for
the shortest time possibl but i onli said
it is most kind of you to take in complet stranger thu no
not complet i ad look toward anscomb who wa
follow on the tire hors a few pace behind for you knew
hi father did you not
hi father he said lift hi eyebrow no oh i
rememb i said someth to that effect the other night but it
wa a mistak i mix up two name as on often doe after a
laps of mani year
i understand i answer but rememb anscomb stori i
reflect to myself that our vener host wa an excel
liar or more probabl he meant to convei that he wish the
subject of hi youth reminisc to be taboo
just then we reach the hous which had a pretti patch of
wellkept flowergarden in front of it surround by a fenc
cover with wire net to keep out buck by the gate squat
our three retain look veri blown and rather asham of
themselv
your master wish to thank you for your help in a dark hour
footsack and i wish to congratul you all upon the swift
of your feet i said in dutch
oh baa the basuto were mani and their spear ar sharp he
began apologet
be silent you run dog i said and go help your master to
dismount
then we went through the gate anscomb lean on my shoulder
and on that of mr marnham and up the path which wa border
with fenc of the monthli rose toward the hous realli thi
wa almost as charm to look at near at hand as it had been
from far awai of cours the whole thing wa crude in detail
rough halfshap block of marbl from the neighbour quarri
had been built into wall and column noth wa finish and
consid bit by bit all wa coars and ugli yet the gener
effect wa beauti becaus it wa an effect of design the
pictur of an artist who did not fulli understand the
technic of paint the work of a great writer who had as
yet no proper skill in word never did i see a small build
that struck me more but then what experi have i of
build and as anscomb remind me afterward it wa but a
copi of someth design when the world wa young or rather
when civil wa young and man new risen from the infinit
ag of savageri saw beauti in hi dream and tri to symbol
it in shape of stone
we came to the broad stoep to which sever rough block of
marbl serv as step on it in a long chair made of nativ
wood and seat with hide rimpi sat or rather loll a man in a
dressinggown who wa read a book he rais himself as we
came and the light of the sun for the verandah face to the
east shone full upon hi face so that i saw him well it wa
that of a man of someth under forti year of ag dark
power and wearynot a good face i thought inde it gave
me the impress of on who had allow the evil which exist in
the natur of all of us to becom hi master or had even
encourag it to do so
in the psalm and elsewher we ar alwai read of the
righteou and the unright until those term grow wearisom
it is onli of late year that i have discov or think that i
have discov what thei mean our live cannot be judg by
our deed thei must be judg by our desir or rather by our
moral attitud it is not what we do so much as what we try to
do that count in the format of charact all fall short
all fail but in the end those who seek to climb out of the pit
those who strive howev vainli to fashion failur to success
ar by comparison the righteou while those who ar content to
wallow in our nativ mire and to glut themselv with the daili
bread of vice ar the unright to turn our back thereon
wilfulli and without caus is the real unforgiv sin against
the spirit at least that is the best definit of the problem
at which i in my simplic can arriv
such thought have often occur to me in consid the
charact of dr rodd and some other whom i have known inde
the germ of them aros in my mind which be weari at the
time and therefor somewhat vacant wa perhap the more open to
extern impress as i look upon the face of thi stranger
on the stoep moreov as i am proud to record i did not judg
him altogeth wrongli he wa a blackguard who under other
influenc or with a few ad grain of selfrestraint and of
the power of recoveri might have becom a good or even a saintli
man but by some malic of fate or some evil inherit from an
unknown past those grain were lack and therefor he went
not up but down the hill
case for you rodd call out marnham
inde he answer get to hi feet and speak in a full
voic which like hi partner wa that of an educ
englishman what the matter hors accid
then we were introduc and anscomb began to explain hi
injuri
um said the doctor studi him with dark ey kaffir
bullet through the foot some dai ago ought to be attend to
at onc also you look pretti done so dont tire yourself with
the stori which i can get from mr quatermain come and lie
down and ill have a look at you while thei ar cook
breakfast
then he guid us to a room of which the doubl french window
open on to the stoep a veri pretti room with two bed in it
make anscomb lie down on on of these he turn up hi
trouser undid my rough bandag and examin the wound
pain he ask
veri answer anscomb right up to the thigh
after thi he drew off the nether garment and made a further
examin
um he said again i must syring thi out stai still while
i get some stuff
i follow him from the room and when we were out of hear on
the stoep inquir what he thought i did not like the look of
that leg
it is veri bad he answer so bad that i am wonder if it
wouldnt be best to remov the limb below the knee and make it a
job you can see for yourself that it is septic and the
inflamm is spread up rapidli
good heaven i exclaim do you fear mortif
he nod cant sai what wa on that slug or bit of old iron
and he hasnt had the best chanc sinc mortif or
tetanu or both ar more than possibl is he a temper
man
so far as i know i answer and stare at him while he
thought then he said with decis
that make a differ to lose a foot is a seriou thing
some might think almost as bad as death ill give him a chanc
but if those symptom do not abat in twentyfour hour i must
oper you neednt be afraid i wa hous surgeon at a london
hospitalonc and i keep my hand in lucki you came straight
here
have made hi prepar and wash hi hand he return
syring the wound with some antisept stuff and dress and
bandag the leg up to the knee after thi he gave anscomb hot
milk to drink with two egg broken into it and told him to rest
a while as he must not eat anyth solid at present then he
threw a blanket over him and sign to me to come awai let
down a mat over the window
i put a littl someth into that milk he said outsid
which will send him to sleep for a few hour so we will leav
him quiet now youll want a wash
where ar you go to take mr quatermain ask marnham who
wa seat on the stoep
into my room he answer
why there heda readi
heda might return at ani moment repli the doctor also mr
quatermain had better sleep in mr anscomb room he will veri
like want some on to look after him at night
marnham open hi mouth to speak again then chang hi mind
and wa silent as a servant is silent under rebuk the
incid wa quit trifl yet it reveal to me the rel
attitud of these two men without a doubt rodd wa the master
of hi partner who did not even care to disput with him about
the matter of the us of hi daughter bedroom thei were a
queer coupl who had it not been for my anxieti as to anscomb
ill would have interest me veri much as inde thei were
destin to do
well i went to tidi up in the doctor room and as he left me
alon while i wash had the opportun of studi it a
littl like the rest of the hous it wa line with nativ wood
which wa made to serv as the back of bookshelv and of
cupboard fill with medicin and instrument the book
form a queer collect there were medic work
philosoph work histori novel most of them french and
other volum of a sort that i imagin ar gener kept under
lock and kei also some that had to do with occult matter
there wa even a bibl i open it thoughtlessli half in idl
curios to see whether it wa ever us onli to replac it in
hast for at the veri page that my ey fell on i rememb it
wa on of my favourit chapter in isaiah wa a stamp in violet
ink mark h ms prisonwel i wont sai where
i mai state howev that the clue enabl me in after year to
learn an episod in thi man life which had brought about hi
ruin there is no need to repeat it or to sai more than that
gambl and an evil us of hi medic knowledg to provid the
monei to pai hi debt were the caus of hi fall the strang
thing is that he should have kept the book which had probabl
been given to him by the prison chaplain still everybodi make
mistak sometim or it mai have had associ for him and
of cours he had never seen thi stamp upon an unread page which
happen to leap to my ey
now i wa abl to make a shrewd guess at hi later career after
hi troubl he had emigr and began to practis in south
africa somehow hi ident had been discov hi past wa
drag up against him possibl by rival jealou of hi skill
hi busi went and he found it advis to retir to the
transvaal befor the annex at that time the home of sundri
peopl of broken reput even there he did not stop in a town
but hid himself upon the edg of savageri here he foregath
with anoth man of queer charact marnham and in hi compani
enter upon some doubt but lucr form of trade while
still indulg hi love of medicin by doctor and oper
upon nativ over whom he would in thi wai acquir great
influenc inde as i discov befor the dai wa over he
had quit a littl hospit at the back of the hous in which
were four or five bed occupi by kaffir and serv by two male
nativ nurs whom he had train also number of outpati
visit him some of whom travel from great distanc and
occasion but not often he attend white peopl who chanc
to be in the neighbourhood
the three of us breakfast in a realli charm room from the
window of which could be studi a view as beauti as ani i
know the kaffir who wait were well train and dress in
neat linen uniform the cook wa good there wa real silver
on the tabl then a strang sight in that part of africa and
amongst engrav and other pictur upon the wall hung an oil
portrait of a veri beauti young woman with dark hair and ey
is that your daughter mr marnham i ask
no he repli rather shortli it is her mother
immedi afterward he wa call from the room to speak to
some on whereon the doctor said
a foreign as you see a hungarian the hungarian women ar
veri good look and veri charm
so i have understood i answer but doe thi ladi live
here
oh no she is dead or i believ that she is dead i am not
sure becaus i make it a rule never to pry into peopl privat
affair all i know about her is that she wa a beauti whom
marnham marri late in life upon the contin when she wa but
eighteen as is common in such case he wa veri jealou of her
but it didnt last long as she di or i understand that she
di within a year of her daughter birth the loss affect
him so much that he emigr to south africa with the child and
began life anew i do not think that thei correspond with
hungari and he never speak of her even to hi daughter which
suggest that she is dead
i reflect that all these circumst might equal well
suggest sever other thing but said noth think it
wisest not to pursu the subject present marnham return and
inform me that a nativ had just brought him word that the
basuto had made off homeward with our cattl but had left the
wagon and it content quit untouch not even steal the
spare gun and ammunit
that luck i said astonish but extrem strang how
do you explain it mr marnham
he shrug hi shoulder and answer
as everi on know you ar a much greater expert in nativ
habit and custom than i am mr quatermain
there ar onli two thing that i can think of i said on is
that for some reason or other thei thought the wagon tagati
bewitch you know and that it would bring evil on them to touch
it though thi did not appli to the oxen the other is that
thei suppos it but not the oxen to belong to some friend of
their own whose properti thei did not wish to injur
he look at me sharpli but said noth and i went on to tell
them the detail of the attack that had been made upon us
ad
the odd part of the affair is that on of those basuto call
out to us that some infern scoundrel of a white had warn
sekukuni of our come and that he had order them to take our
gun and cattl thi basuto who wa wound and prai for
merci wa drown befor he could tell me who the white man
wa
a boer i expect said marnham quietli as you know thei ar
not particularli well affect toward us english just now also
i happen to be awar that some of them ar intrigu with
sekukuni against the british through makurupiji hi mouth or
primeminist a veri clever old scamp who like to have two
stool to sit on
and doubtless will end by fall between them well you see
now that i think of it the wound kaffir onli said that thei
were order to take our gun and oxen and incident our
live the wagon wa not mention
quit so mr quatermain i will send some of our boi to help
your servant to bring everyth it contain up here
cant you lend me a team of oxen i ask to drag it to the
hous
no we have noth but young cattl left both redwat and
lungsick have been so bad thi season that all the horn
stock have been swept out of the countri i doubt whether you
could beg borrow or steal a team of oxen thi side of pretoria
except from some of the dutchmen who wont part
that awkward i hope to be abl to trek in a dai or two
your friend wont be abl to trek for a good mani dai at the
best broke in the doctor who had been listen unconcernedli
but of cours you could get awai on the hors after it ha
rest
you told me you left a span of oxen at pretoria said marnham
why not go and fetch them here or if you dont like to leav
mr anscomb send your driver and the boi
thank for the idea i will think it over i answer
that morn after footsack and the voorloop had been sent with
some of the servant from the templ to fetch up the content of
the wagon for i wa too tire to accompani them have found
that anscomb wa still asleep i determin to follow hi
exampl find a long chair on the stoep i sat down and
slumber in it sweetli for hour i dreamt of all sort of
thing then through my dream it seem to me that i heard two
voic talk those of our marnham and rodd not on the stoep
but at a distanc from it as a matter of fact thei were
talk but so far awai that in my ordinari wake state i could
never have heard them my own belief is that the sens and i
mai add the semispiritu part of us ar much more acut when
we lie half bound in the bond of sleep than when we ar what is
call wide awak doubtless when we ar quit bound thei attain
the limit of their power and i think sail at time to the
uttermost end of be but unhappili of their experi we
rememb noth when we awak in half sleep it is differ
then we do retain some recollect
in thi curiou condit of mind it seem to me that rodd said
to marnham
why have you brought these men here
i did not bring them here he answer luck fate fortun
god or the devil call it what you will brought them here
though if you had your wish it is true thei would never have
come still as thei have come i am glad it is someth to
me live in thi hell to get a chanc of talk to english
gentlemen again befor i die
english gentlemen remark rodd reflect well anscomb
is of cours but how about that other hunter after all in
what wai is he better than the score of other hunter and kaffir
trader and wander whom on meet in thi strang land
in what wai inde thought i to myself in my dream
if you cant see i cant explain to you but as i happen to
know the man is of blood as good as mineand a great deal
better than your he ad with a touch of insol
moreov he ha an honest name among white and black which is
much in thi countri
ye repli the doctor in the same reflect voic i agre
with you i let him pass as a gentleman but i repeat why did
you bring them here when with on more word it would have been so
easi and he stop
i have told you it wa not i what ar you drive at
do you think it is exactli conveni especi when we ar
under the british flag again to have two peopl who we both
admit ar english gentlemen that is clean clearei men
consid us and our affair for an indefinit period just
becaus you wish for the pleasur of their societi would it not
have been better to tell those basuto to let them trek on to
pretoria
i dont know what would have been better i repeat what ar
you drive at
heda is come home in a dai or two she might be here ani
time remark rodd as he knock the ash out of hi pipe
ye becaus you made me write and sai that i want her but
what of that
noth in particular except that i am not sure that i wish her
to associ with an english gentleman like thi anscomb
marnham laugh scornfulli ah i understand he said too
clean and straight complic might ensu and the rest of
it well i wish to god thei would for i know the anscomb or
us to and i know the genu call rodd
dont be insult you mai carri the thing too far on dai and
whatev i have done i have paid for but youv not paidyet
the man is veri ill you ar a skill doctor if your
afraid of him why dont you kill him ask marnham with bitter
scorn
there you have me repli rodd men mai shed much but most
of them never shed their profession honour i shall do my
honest best to cure mr anscomb and i tell you that he will
take some cure
then i woke up and as no on wa in sight wonder whether or
no i had been dream the upshot of it wa that i made up my
mind to send footsack to pretoria for the oxen not to go myself
chapter v
a game of card
i slept in anscomb room that night and look after him he
wa veri feverish and the pain in hi leg kept him awak a good
deal he told me that he could not bear dr rodd and wish to
get awai at onc i had to explain to him that thi wa
imposs until hi spare oxen arriv which i wa go to send
for to pretoria but of other matter includ that of the
danger state of hi foot i said noth i wa thank when
toward two in the morn he fell into a sound sleep and
allow me to do the same
befor breakfast time just as i had finish dress myself in
some of the clean thing which had been brought from the wagon
rodd came and made a thorough and businesslik examin of
hi patient while i await the result with anxieti on the
stoep at length he appear and said
well i think that we shall be abl to save the foot though i
cant be quit sure for anoth twentyfour hour the worst
symptom have abat and hi temperatur is down by two degre
anywai he will have to stai in bed and live on light food till it
is normal after which he might lie in a long chair on the stoep
on no account must he attempt to stand
i thank him for hi inform heartili enough and ask him
if he knew where marnham wa as i want to speak to him with
refer to the despatch of footsack to fetch the oxen from
pretoria
not up yet i think he answer i fanci that yesterdai wa
on of hi wet night excit of meet stranger and so
on
wet night i queri wish for a clearer explan
ye he is a grand old fellow on of the best but like most
other peopl he ha hi littl weak and when the fit is on
him he can put awai a surpris amount of liquor i tell you so
that you should not be astonish if you notic anyth or try
to argu with him when he is in that state as then hi temper is
apt to bewel live now i must go and give him a pint of
warm milk that is hi favourit antidot and in fact the best
there is
i thought to myself that we had struck a nice establish in
which to be ti liter by the leg for an indefinit period
i wa not particularli flush at the time but i know i would have
paid a 100 to be out of it befor the end i should have been
glad to throw in everyth that i had but mercifulli that wa
hidden from me
rodd and i breakfast togeth and discours of kaffir custom
as to which he wa singularli well inform then i accompani
him to see hi nativ patient in the littl hospit of which i
have spoken believ the man to be a thorough scamp as i did
it wa astonish to me to note how gentl and forbear he wa
to these peopl of hi skill i need sai noth as that wa
evid he wa go to perform an intern oper upon a
burli old savag rather a seriou on i believ at ani rate it
necessit chloroform he ask me if i would like to assist
but i declin respectfulli have no tast for such thing so
i left him boil hi instrument and put on what look
like a clean nightgown over hi cloth and return to the
stoep
here i found marnham whose ey were rather bloodshot though
otherwis except for a shaki hand he seem right enough he
murmur someth about have overslept himself and inquir
veri polit for hi manner were beauti after anscomb and
as to whether we were quit comfort and so forth after thi
i consult him as to the best road for our servant to travel by
to pretoria and later on despatch them give footsack
variou note to ensur the deliveri of the oxen to him also i
gave him some monei to pai for their keep and told him with mani
threat to get back with the beast as quick as he could travel
then i sent him and the two other boi off not without
misgiv although he wa an experienc man in hi wai and
promis faithfulli to fulfil everi injunct to the letter to
me he seem so curious glad to go that i inquir the reason
sinc after a journei like our it would have been more natur
if he had wish to rest
oh baa he said i dont think thi tampel veri healthi for
colour peopl i am told of some who have di here that man
karl who gave me the diamond i think he must have di also at
least i saw hi spook last night stand over me and shake hi
head and the boi saw it too
oh be off with your talk of spook i said and come back
quickli with those oxen or i promis you that you will die and
be a spook yourself
i will baa i will he ejacul and depart almost at a
run leav me rather uncomfort
i believ noth of the tale of the spook of karl but i saw
that footsack believ in it and wa afraid lest he might be
therebi prevent from return i would much rather have gone
myself but it wa imposs for me to leav anscomb so ill in
the hand of our strang host and there wa no on els whom i
could send i might perhap have ridden to pilgrim rest and
tri to find a white messeng there inde afterward i
regret not have done so although it would have involv at
least a dai absenc at a veri critic time but the truth is
i never thought of it until too late and probabl if i had i
should not have been abl to discov anyon whom i could trust
as i walk back to the hous have part from footsack on
the top of a neighbour ridg whenc i could point out hi path
to him i met marnham ride awai he pull up and said that he
wa go down to the granit stream to arrang about set
some on up to watch the wagon i express sorrow that he
should have the troubl which should have been mine if i could
have got awai whereon he answer that he wa glad of the
opportun for a ride as it wa someth to do
how do you fill in your time here i ask carelessli as you
dont farm
oh by trade he repli and with a nod set hi hors to a
canter
a queer sort of trade thought i to myself where there is no
store now what exactli doe he trade in i wonder
as it happen i wa destin to find out befor i wa an hour
older have given anscomb a look and found that he wa
comfort i thought that i would inspect the quarri whenc the
marbl came of which the hous wa built as it had occur to
me that if there wa plenti of it it might be worth exploit
some time in the futur it had been point out to me in the
midst of some thorn in a gulli that ran at right angl to the
main kloof not more than a few hundr yard from the hous
follow a path over which the stone had been drag
origin i came to the spot and discov that a littl
caviti had been quarri in what seem to me to be a posit
mountain of pure white marbl i examin the place as
thoroughli as i could climb among some bush that grew in
surfac earth which had been wash down from the top in order
to do so
at the back of these bush there wa a hole larg enough for a
man to creep through i crept through with the object of
ascertain whether the marbl vein continu to my surpris
i found a stout yellowwood door within feet of the mouth of the
hole reflect that no doubt it wa here that the quarrymen
kept or had kept tool and explos i gave it a push i
suppos it had been left unfasten accident or that
someth had gone wrong with the lock at ani rate it swung
open pursu my research as to the depth of the marbl i
advanc boldli and the place be dark struck a match
evid the marbl did continu as i could see by the
glitter roof of a cavern for such it wa but the floor
attract my attent as well as the roof for on it were
numer case not unlik coffin bear the stamp of a
wellknown birmingham firm label fenc iron and
address to messr marnham rodd transvaal via delagoa
bai
i knew at onc what thei were have seen the like befor but
if ani doubt remain in my mind it wa easi to solv for as it
chanc on of the case wa open and half empti i slip my
hand into it as i thought it contain the ordinari kaffir gun
of commerc cost deliv in africa sai 35 cost deliv
to nativ chief in cash or cattl sai 10 which when the
market is eager allow for a decent profit contempl those
case survivor probabl of a much larger stock i understood
how it came about that sekukuni had dare to show fight against
the govern doubtless it wa henc that the gun had come
which sent a bullet through anscomb foot and nearli polish
off both of us
moreov as further match show me that cave contain other
storesitem keg of gunpowd item cask of cheap spirit
item bar of lead also a box mark bullet mould and anoth
mark percuss cap i think too there were some innoc
bag full of bead and a few packag of birminghammad assegai
blade there mai have been other thing but if so i did not
wait to investig them gather up the end of my match
and in case there should be ani dust in the place that would
show footmark flap the stone floor behind me with my pocket
handkerchief i retir and continu my investig of that
wonder marbl deposit from the bottom of the quarri to which
have rearrang the bush i descend by anoth rout
leap like a buck from stone to stone
it wa just as well that i did so for a few minut later dr
rodd appear
made a good job of your oper i ask cheerfulli
pretti fair thank he answer although that kaffir tri
to brain the nurseman when he wa come out of the anesthet
but ar you interest in geologi
a littl i repli that is if there is ani chanc of make
monei out of it which there ought to be here as thi marbl
look almost as good as that of carrara but flint instrument
ar more my line that is in an ignor and amateur wai as i
think thei ar in your for i saw some in your room tell me
what do you think of thi is it a scraper and i produc a
stone out of my pocket which i had found a week befor in the
bushveld
at onc he forgot hi suspicion of which i could see he arriv
veri full inde thi curiou man as it happen wa realli
fond of flint instrument of which he knew a great deal
did you find thi here he ask
i led him sever yard further from the mouth of the cave and
point out the exact spot where i said i had pick it up
amongst some quarri debri then follow a most learn
discuss for it appear that thi wa a flint instrument of
the rarest and most valuabl type on that noah might have us
or job might have scrape himself with and the question wa how
the dicken had it come among that quarri debri in the end we
left the problem undecid and have present the articl to
dr rodd a gift for which he thank me with real warmth i
return to the hous fill with the glow that reward on who
ha made a valuabl discoveri
of the follow three dai i have noth particular to sai
except that dure them i wa perhap more acut bore than
ever i had been in my life befor the hous wa beauti in
it own fashion the food wa excel there wa everyth i
could want to drink and rodd announc that he no longer fear
the necess of oper upon anscomb leg hi recoveri wa
now a mere matter of time and meanwhil he must not us hi foot
or let the blood run into it more than could be help which
meant that he must keep himself in a recumb posit the
troubl wa that i had noth on earth do except studi the
charact of our host which i found disagre and
depress i might have gone out shoot but noth of the
sort wa allow upon the properti in obedi to the wish of
miss heda a mysteri young person who wa alwai expect and
never appear and beyond it i wa afraid to travel for fear of
basuto i might have gone to pilgrim rest or lydenburg to
make report of the nefari deed of the said basuto but at
best it would have taken on or two dai and possibl i should
have been detain by offici who never consid ani on time
except their own
thi meant that i should have been oblig to leav anscomb
alon which i did not wish to do so i just sat still and as i
have said wa intens bore hang about the place and
smoke more than wa good for me
in due cours anscomb emerg on to the stoep where he lai with
hi leg up and wa also bore especi after he had tri to
pump old marnham about hi past in the guard and complet
fail it wa in thi mood of utter deject that we agre to
plai a game of card on even not that either of us care
for card inde person i have alwai detest them
becaus with variouscolour counter to repres monei which
never pass thei had form on of the afflict of my youth
it wa so annoi if you won to be hand a number of green
counter and be inform that thei repres so mani hundr
or thousand of pound or viceversa if you lost for as it cost
no on anyth my dear father insist upon plai for
enorm stake never in ani aspect of life have i care for
fool anscomb also dislik card i think becaus hi
ancestor too had plai with counter such as some that i have
seen belong to the cocoatre club and other gambl place
of a past gener mark as high as a thousand guinea which
counter must next morn be redeem in hard cash wherebi hi
famili had been not a littl impoverish
i fanci you will find thei ar highflier he said when the
pair had left to fetch a suitabl tabl for the night be veri
hot we were go to plai on the stoep by the light of the
hang paraffin lamp and some candl i repli to the effect
that i could not afford to lose larg sum of monei especi
to men who for aught i knew might then be engag in mark the
card
i understand he answer dont you bother about that old
fellow thi is my affair arrang for my special amus i
shant grumbl if the fun cost someth for i am sure there
will be fun
all right i said onli if we should happen to win monei it
your not mine
to myself i reflect howev that with these two oppon we
had about as much chanc of win as a snowflak ha of
resist the atmospher of the lower region
present thei return with the tabl which had a green cloth
over it that hung down halfwai to the ground also on of the
nativ boi brought a trai with spirit from which i judg by
variou sign old marnham who had alreadi drunk hi share at
dinner had help himself freeli on the wai soon we were
arrang anscomb who wa to be my partner opposit to me in
hi long chair and the game began
i forget what particular variant of card it wa we plai
though i know it admit of high and progress stake at
first howev these were quit moder and we won as i
suppos we were meant to do after half an hour or so marnham
rose to help himself to brandi and water a great deal of brandi
and veri littl water while i took a nip of holland and
anscomb and rodd fill their pipe
i think thi is get rather slow said rodd to anscomb i
vote we put a bit more on
as much as you like answer anscomb with a littl drawl and
twinkl of the ey which alwai show that he wa amus
both quatermain and i ar born gambler dont look angri
quatermain you know you ar onli if we lose you will have to
take a chequ for i have preciou littl cash
i think that will be good enough repli the doctor
quietlyif you lose
so the stake were increas to an amount that made my hair stand
up stiffer even than usual and the game went on behold a
marvel came to pass how it happen i do not know unless
marnham had brought the wrong card by mistak or had grown too
fuddl to understand hi partner telegraph signal which i
be accustom to observ saw him make not onc but often
still we won what is more with a few setback we went on
win till present the sum written down to our credit for
no actual cash pass were consider and all the while at
the end of each bout marnham help himself to more brandi while
the doctor grew more mad in a suppressedthund kind of a wai
for my part i becam alarm especi as i perceiv that
anscomb wa on the verg of break into open merriment and
hi leg be up i could not kick him under the tabl
my partner ought to go to bed dont you think we should stop
i said
on the whole i do repli rodd glower at marnham who
somewhat unsteadili wa engag in wipe drop of brandi from
hi long beard
dd if i do exclaim that worthi when i wa young and
plai with gentlemen thei alwai gave loser an opportun of
reveng
then repli anscomb with a flash of hi ey let us try to
follow in the footstep of the gentlemen with whom you plai in
your youth i suggest that we doubl the stake
that right that the old form said marnham
the doctor half rose from hi chair then sat down again
watch him i conclud that he believ hi partner a
season vessel wa not so drunk as he pretend to be and
either in an actual or a figur sens had a card up hi
sleev if so it remain there for again we won all the luck
wa with us
i am get tire drawl anscomb lemon and water ar not
sustain shall we stop
by heaven no shout marnham to which anscomb repli that
if it wa wish he would plai anoth hand but no more
all right said marnham but let it be for doubl or quit
he spoke quit quietli and seem suddenli to have grown sober
now i think that rodd made up hi mind that he realli wa act
and that he realli had that card up hi sleev at ani rate he
did not object i howev wa of a differ opinion have
often seen drunken men succumb to an access of sobrieti under the
stress of excit and remark that it did not last long
do you realli mean that i said speak for the first time
and address myself to the doctor i dont quit know what
the sum involv is but it must be larg
of cours he answer
then rememb that at the worst anscomb stood to lose
noth i shrug my shoulder and held my tongu it wa
marnham deal and although he wa somewhat in the shadow of the
hang lamp and the candl had gutter out i distinctli saw
him plai some hocuspocu with the card but in the
circumst made no protest as it chanc he must have
hocuspocus them wrong for though hi hand wa full of
trump rodd held noth at all the battl that ensu wa
quit excit but the end of it wa that an ac in the hand of
anscomb who realli wa quit a good player did the busi
and we won again
in the rather aw silenc that follow anscomb remark in
hi cheer drawl
im not sure that my addit is quit right well check that
in the morn but i make out that you two gentlemen ow
quatermain and myself 749 10
then the doctor broke out
you accurs old fool he hissedther is no other word for
itat marnham how ar you go to pai all thi monei that
you have gambl awai drunken beast that you ar
easili enough you felon shout marnham so and thrust
hi hand into hi pocket he pull out a number of diamond which
he threw upon the tabl ad there what will cover it
twice over and there ar more where thei came from as you know
well enough my medic jailbird
you dare to call me that gasp the doctor in a voic laden
with furi so intens that it had depriv him of hi reason
youyoumurder oh why dont i kill you as i shall some
dai and lift hi glass which wa half full he threw the
content into marnham face
that a nice man for a prospect soninlaw isnt he
exclaim the old scamp as seiz the brandi decant he
hurl it straight at rodd head onli miss him by an inch
dont you think you had both better go to bed gentlemen i
inquir you ar sai thing you might regret in the
morn
appar thei did think it for without anoth word thei rose
and march off in differ direct to their respect
room which i heard both of them lock for my part i collect
the iou also the diamond which still lai upon the tabl
while anscomb examin the card
mark by jove he said oh my dear quatermain never have i
had such an amus even in all my life
shut up you silli idiot i answer therel be murder done
over thi busi and i onli hope it wont be on us
chapter vi
miss heda
it might be thought that after all thi there would have been a
pain explan on the follow morn but noth of the
sort happen after all the greatest art is the art of ignor
thing without which the world could scarc go on even among
the savag race thu on thi occas the two chief actor in
the scene of the previou night pretend that thei had forgotten
what took place as i believ to a larg extent truli the
fierc flame of drink in the on and of passion in the other had
burnt the web of remembr to ash thei knew that someth
unpleas had occur and it main outlin the rest had
vanish awai perhap becaus thei knew also that thei were not
respons for what thei said and did and therefor that what
occur had no right to a perman nich in their memori it
wa as it were someth outsid of their normal selv at
least so i conjectur and their conduct seem to give colour
to my guess
the doctor spoke to me of the matter first
i fear there wa a row last night he said it ha happen
here befor over card and will no doubt happen again until
matter clear themselv up somehow marnham as you see
drink and when drunk is the biggest liar in the world and i i
am sorri to sai am curs with a violent temper dont judg
either of us too harshli if you were a doctor you would know
that all these thing come to us with our blood and we didnt
fashion our own clai did we have some coffe wont you
subsequ when rodd wasnt there marnham spoke also and with
that fine air of courtesi which wa peculiar to him
i ow a deep apolog he said to yourself and mr anscomb
i do not recal much about it but i know there wa a scene last
night over those curs card a weak overtak me
sometim i will sai no more except that you who ar also a
man who perhap have felt weak of on sort or anoth
will i hope make allow for me and pai no attent to
anyth that i mai have said or done in the presenc of guest
ye that is what pain mein the presenc of guest
someth in hi distinguish manner caus me to reflect upon
everi peccadillo that i had ever commit set it in it
veri worst light
quit so i answer quit so prai do not mention the
matter ani more although these word seem to jerk
themselv out of my throat you did call each other by such
veri hard name
i daresai he answer with a vacant smile but if so thei
meant noth
no i understand just like a lover quarrel but look here
you left some diamond on the tabl which i took to keep the
kaffir out of temptat i will fetch them
did i well probabl i left some iou also which might
serv for pipelight so suppos we set the on against the
other i dont know the valu of either the diamond or the
pipelight it mai be less or more but for god sake dont let
me see the beastli thing again there no need i have
plenti
i must speak to anscomb i answer the monei at stake wa
hi not mine
speak to whom you will he repli and i note that the
throb vein upon hi forehead indic a rise temper but
never let me see those diamond again throw them into the
gutter if you wish but never let me see them again or there
will be troubl
then he flung out of the room leav hi breakfast almost
untast
reflect that thi queer old bird probabl did not wish to be
crossquest as to hi possess of so mani uncut diamond
or that thei were worth much less than the sum he had lost or
possibl that thei were not diamond at all but glass i went to
report the matter to anscomb he onli laugh and said that as
i had got the thing i had better keep them until someth
happen for we had both got it into our head that someth
would happen befor we had done with that establish
so i went to put the stone awai as safe as i could while i
wa do so i heard the rumbl of wheel and came out just in
time to see a cape cart drawn by four veri good hors and
driven by a hottentot in a smart hat and a red waistband pull up
at the garden gate out of thi cart present emerg a neatli
dress ladi of whom all i could see wa that she wa young
slender and rather tall also as her back wa toward me that
she had a great deal of auburn hair
there said anscomb i knew that someth would happen
heda ha happen quatermain as neither her vener parent
nor her love fianc for such i gather he is seem to be
about you had better go and give her a hand
i obei with a groan heartili wish that heda hadnt
happen sinc some sens warn me that she would onli add to
the present complic at the gate have given some
instruct to a veri stout young colour woman who i took it
wa her maid about a basket of flower root in the cart she
turn round suddenli and we came face to face with the gate
between us for a moment we stare at each other i reflect
that she realli wa veri pretti with her delicatelyshap
featur her fresh healthylook complexion her long dark
eyelash and her lith and charm figur what she reflect
about me i dont know probabl noth half so complimentari
suddenli howev her larg greyish ey grew troubl and a
look of alarm appear upon her face
is anyth wrong with my father she ask i dont see
him
if you mean mr marnham i repli lift my hat i believ
that dr rodd and he
never mind about dr rodd she broke in with a contemptu
littl jerk of her chin how is my father
i imagin much as usual he and dr rodd were here a littl
while ago i suppos that thei have gone out as a matter of
fact thei had but in differ direct
then that all right she said with a sigh of relief you
see i heard that he wa veri ill which is why i have come
back
so thought i to myself she love that old scamp and
shedoesnt love the doctor there will be more troubl as sure
as five and two ar seven all we want wa a woman to make the
pot boil over
then i open the gate and took a travel bag from her hand
with my politest bow
my name is quatermain and that of my friend anscomb we ar
stai here you know i said rather awkwardli
inde she answer with a delight smile what a veri
strang place to choos to stai in
it is a beauti hous i remark
not bad although i design it more or less but i wa
allud to it inhabit
thi finish me and i am sure she felt that i could think of
noth nice to sai about those inhabit for i heard her
sigh we walk side by side up the rosefring path and
present arriv at the stoep where anscomb whose hair i had
cut veri nice on the previou dai wa watch us from hi
long chair thei look at each other and i saw both of them
colour a littl out of mere foolish i suppos
anscomb i said thi is and i paus not be quit
certain whether she also wa call marnham heda marnham she
interrupt
yesmiss heda marnham and thi is the honour mauric
anscomb
forgiv me for not rise miss marnham said anscomb in hi
pleasant voic by the wai her wa pleasant too full and rather
low with just a suggest of someth foreign about it a
shot through the foot prevent me at present
who shot you she ask quickli
oh onli a kaffir
i am so sorri i hope you will get well soon forgiv me now i
must go to look for my father
she is uncommonli pretti remark anscomb and a ladi into
the bargain in reflect on old marnham sin we must put it
to hi credit that he ha produc a charm daughter
too pretti and charm by half i grunt
perhap dr rodd is of the same wai of think great shame
that such a girl should be hand over to a medic scoundrel
like dr rodd i wonder if she care for him
just about as much as a canari care for a tomcat i have
found that out alreadi
realli quatermain you ar admir i never knew anyon who
could make a better us of the briefest opportun
then we were silent wait not without a certain impati
for the return of miss heda she did return with surpris
quick consid that she had found time to search for her
parent to chang into a clean white dress and to pin a singl
hibiscu flower on to her bodic which gave just the touch of
colour that wa necessari to complet her costum
i cant find my father she said but the boi sai he ha gone
out ride i cant find anybodi when you have been summon
from a long wai off and travel posthast rather to your own
inconveni it is amus isnt it
wagon and cart in south africa dont arriv like express
train miss marnham said anscomb so you shouldnt be
offend
i am not at all offend mr anscomb now that i know there
is noth the matter with my father imbut tell me how did
you get your wound
so he told her with much amus detail after hi fashion she
listen quietli with a pucker up brow and onli made on
comment it wa
i wonder what white man told those sekukuni kaffir that you
were come
i dont know he answer but he deserv a bullet through
him somewher abov the ankl
ye though few peopl get what thei deserv in thi wick
world
so i have often thought had it been otherwis for exampl i
should have been
what would you have been she ask consid him curious
oh a better shot than mr allan quatermain and as beauti as
a ladi i onc saw in my youth
dont talk rubbish befor luncheon i remark sternli and we
all laugh the first wholesom laughter that i had heard at the
templ for thi young ladi seem to bring happi and
merriment with her i rememb wonder what it wa of which
her come remind me and conclud that it wa like the sight
and smell of a peach orchard in full bloom stumbl on suddenli
in the black desert of the burnt winter veld
after thi we becam quit friendli she dilat on her skill in
have produc the templ from an old engrav which she
fetch and show to us at no greater an expens than it would
have cost to build an ordinari hous
that is becaus the marbl wa at hand said anscomb
quit so she repli demur speak in a gener sens
on can do mani thing in lifeif the marbl is at hand onli
most of us when we look for marbl find sandston or mud
bravo said anscomb i have gener lit upon the
sandston
and i on the mud she muse
and i on all three for the earth contain marbl and mud and
sandston to sai noth of gold and jewel i broke in be
tire of silenc
but neither of them paid much attent to me anscomb did sai
out of polit i suppos that pitch and subterranean fire
should be ad or some such nonsens
then she began to tell him of her infantil memori of hungari
which were extrem faint of how thei came thi place and live
first of all in two larg kaffir hut until suddenli thei began
to grow rich of her school dai at maritzburg of the friend
with whom she had been stai and i know not what until at
last i got up and went out for a walk
when i return an hour or so later thei were still talk and
so continu to do until dr rodd arriv upon the scene at
first thei did not see him for he stood at an angl to them but
i saw him and watch hi face with a great deal of interest
it or rather it express wa not pleasant befor now i have
seen someth like it on that of a wild beast which think that
it is about to be rob of it prei by a stronger wild beast in
short a mixtur of hate fear and jealousyespeci jealousi
at the last i did not wonder for these two seem to be get
on uncommonli well
thei were so to speak well match she of cours wa the
better look of the two a realli pretti and attract young
woman inde but the vivac of anscomb face the twinkl of
hi merri blue ey and it gener refin made up for what
he lackedregular of featur i think he had just told her
on of hi good stori which he alwai manag to make so
humor by a trick of pleas and harmless exagger and
thei were both laugh merrili then she caught sight of the
doctor and her merriment evapor like a drop of water on a hot
shovel distinctli i saw her pull herself togeth and prepar
for someth
how do you do she said rapidli rise and hold out her
slim sunbrown hand but i need not ask you look so well
how do you do my dear with a heavi emphasi on the dear he
answer slowli but i neednt ask for i see that you ar in
perfect health and spirit and he bent forward as though to
kiss her
somehow or other she avoid that endear or seal of
possess i dont quit know how as i turn my head awai
not wish to wit what i felt to be unpleas when i
look up again howev i saw that she had avoid it the
scowl on hi face the demur of her and anscomb evid
amus assur me of thi she wa ask about her father
he answer that he also seem quit well
then why did you write to tell me that i ought to come as he wa
not at all well she inquir with a lift of her delic
eyebrow
the question wa never answer for at that moment marnham
himself appear
oh father she said and rush into hi arm while he kiss
her tenderli on both cheek
so i wa not mistaken thought i to myself she doe realli love
thi moral wreck and what is more he love her which show
that there must be good in him is anyon truli bad i wonder
or for the matter of that truli good either is it not all a
question of circumst and blood
neither then or at ani other time have i found an answer to the
problem at ani rate to me there seem someth beauti
about the meet of these two
the influenc of miss heda in the hous wa felt at onc the
boi becam smarter and put on clean cloth vase of flower
appear in the variou room our wa turn out and clean a
disagre process so far as we were concern moreov at
dinner both marnham and rodd wore dress cloth with short
jacket a circumst that put anscomb and myself to shame
sinc we had none it wa curiou to see how with those dress
cloth which doubtless awok old associ within him
marnham chang hi colour like a chameleon realli he might
have been the colonel of a cavalri regiment rise to toast the
queen after he had sent round the wine so polit and polish
wa hi talk who could have identifi the man with the dry old
ruffian of twentyfour hour befor he who wa drink claret
and veri good claret too mix with water and listen with a
polit interest to all the detail of hi daughter journei
even the doctor look a gentleman which doubtless he wa onc
upon a time in even dress moreov some kind of truce had
been arrang he no longer call miss heda my dear or
attempt ani familiar while she on more than on occas
veri distinctli call him dr rodd
so much for that night and for sever other that follow as
for the dai thei went by pleasantli and idli heda walk about
on her father arm convers in friendli fashion with the
doctor alwai watch him i notic as a cat watch a dog
that she know is wait an opportun to spring and for the
rest associ with us as much as she could particularli did
she seem to take refug behind my own insignific have i
suppos come to the conclus that i wa a harmless person who
might possibl prove us but all the while i felt that the
storm wa bank up inde marnham himself at ani rate to a
great extent plai the part of the cloudcompel jove for
soon it becam evid to me and without doubt to dr rodd also
that he wa encourag the intimaci between hi daughter and
anscomb by everi mean in hi power
in on wai and anoth he had fulli inform himself as to
anscomb prospect in life which were brilliant enough
moreov he like the man who as the remnant of the better
percept of hi youth told him wa on of the best class of
englishmen and what is more he saw that heda like him also as
much inde as she dislik rodd he even spoke to me of the
matter in a roundabout kind of fashion sai that the young
woman who marri anscomb would be lucki and that the father who
had him for a soninlaw might go to hi grave confid of hi
child happi i answer that i agre with him unless the
ladi affect had alreadi caus her to form other ti
affect he exclaim drop all pretenc there ar
none involv in thi accurs busi as you ar quit sharp
enough to have seen for yourself
i understood that an engag wa involv i remark
on my part perhap not on her he answer oh cant you
understand quatermain that sometim men find themselv forc
into strang situat against their will
rememb the veri ugli name that i had heard rodd call marnham
on the night of the card parti i reflect that i could
understand well enough but i onli said
after all marriag is a matter that concern a woman even more
than it doe her father on in short of which she must be the
judg
quit so quatermain but there ar some daughter who ar
prepar to make great sacrific for their father well she
will be of ag er long if onli i can stave it off till then
but how how and with a groan he turn and left me
that old gentleman neck is in some kind of a noos thought i
to myself and hi difficulti is to prevent the rope from be
drawn tight meanwhil thi poor girl happi and futur ar
at stake
allan said anscomb to me a littl later for by now he call
me by my christian name i suppos you havent heard anyth
about those oxen have you
no i could scarc expect to yet but why do you ask
he smile in hi droll fashion and repli becaus interest
as thi household is in sundri wai i think it is about time
that we or at ani rate that i got out of it
your leg isnt fit to travel yet anscomb although rodd sai
that all the symptom ar veri satisfactori
ye but to tell you the truth i am experienc other symptom
quit unknown to that belov physician and so unfamiliar to
myself that i attribut them to the influenc of the local
altitud affect the heart doe it not and thi hous stand
high
dont plai off your joke on me i said sternli what do you
mean
i wonder if you find miss heda attract allan or if you ar
too old i believ there come an ag when the onli beauti
that can move a man ar those of architectur or sceneri or
properli cook food
hang it all i am not methusaleh i repli but if you mean
that you ar fall in love with heda why the deuc dont you
sai so instead of wast my time and your own
becaus time wa given to us to wast properli consid it
is the best us to which it can be put or at ani rate the on
that doe least mischief also becaus i wish to make you sai
it for me that i might judg from the effect of your word
whether it is or is not true i mai add that i fear the former
to be the case
well if you ar in love with the girl you cant expect on so
ancient as myself who is quit out of touch with such folli
to teach you how to act
no allan unfortun there ar occas when on must
reli upon on own wisdom and mine what there is of it tell
me i had better get out of thi but i cant ride even if i took
the hors and you ran behind and the oxen havent come
perhap you could borrow miss marnham cart in which to run
awai from her i suggest sarcast
perhap though i believ it would be fatal to my foot to sit up
in a cart for the next few dai and the hors seem to have been
sent off somewher look here old fellow he went on drop
hi banter tone it rather awkward to make a fool of
oneself over a ladi who is engag to some on els especi
if on suspect that with a littl encourag she might begin
to walk the same road the truth is i have taken the fever
pretti bad wors than ever i did befor and if it isnt stop
soon it will becom chronic
oh no anscomb onli intermitt at the worst and african
malaria nearli alwai yield to a chang of climat
how can i expect a cynic and a misogynist to understand the
simpl fervour of an inexperienc souloh drat it all
quatermain stop your acid chaff and tell me what is to be done
realli i am in a tight place
veri so tight that i rejoic to think as you were kind enough
to point out that my year protect me from anyth of the sort
i have no advic to give i think you had better ask it of the
ladi
well we did have a littl convers hypothet of cours
about some friend of our who found themselv similarli
situat and i regret to sai without result
inde i did not know you had ani mutual acquaint what
did she sai and do
she said noth onli sigh and look as though she were
go to burst into tear and all she did wa to walk awai id
have follow her if i could but as my crutch wasnt there it
wa imposs it seem to me that suddenli i had come up
against a brick wall that there wa someth on her mind which
she could not or would not let out
ye and if you want to know i will tell you what it is rodd
ha got a hold over marnham of a sort that would bring him
somewher near the gallow as the price of hi silenc marnham
ha promis him hi daughter the daughter know that her
father is in thi man power though i think she doe not know
in what wai and be a good girl
an angel you meando call her by her right name especi in
a place where angel ar so much want
well an angel if you likesh ha promis on her part to
marri a man she loath in order to save her parent bacon
just what i conclud from what we heard in the row i wonder
which of that pair is the bigger blackguard well allan that
settl it you and i ar on the side of the angel you will
have to get her out of thi scrape andif shell have me ill
marri her and if she wont why it cant be help now that
a fair divis of labour how ar you go to do it i havent
an idea and if i had i should not presum to interfer with on
so much older and wiser than myself
i suppos that by the time you appear in it the game of head
i win and tail you lose had di out of the world i repli
with an indign snort i think the best thing i can do will
be to take the hors and look for those oxen meanwhil you can
settl your busi by the light of your nativ geniu and i
onli hope youll finish it without murder and sudden death
i sai old fellow said anscomb earnestli you dont realli
mean to go off and leav me in thi hideous i havent
bother much up to the present becaus i wa sure that you would
find a wai out which would be noth to a man of your intellect
and experi i mean it honestli i do inde
do you well i can onli sai that my mind is a perfect blank
but if you will stop talk i will try to think the matter over
there miss heda in the garden cut flower i will go to
help her which will be a veri pleasant chang
and i went leav him to stare after me jealous
chapter vii
the stoep
when i reach miss heda she wa collect halfopen monthli
rose from the hedg and not quit know what to sai i made
the appropri quotat at least it wa appropri to my
thought and from her answer to her also
ye she said i am gather them while i mai and she
sigh and as i thought glanc toward the verandah though of
thi i could not be sure becaus of the wide brim of the hat she
wa wear
then we talk a littl on indiffer matter while i prick
my finger help to pluck the rose she ask me if i thought
that anscomb wa get on well and how long it would be
befor he could travel i repli that dr rodd could tell her
better than myself but that i hope in about a week
in a week she said and although she tri to speak lightli
there wa dismai in her voic
i hope you dont think it too long i answer but even if he
is fit to go the oxen have not come yet and i dont quit know
when thei will
too long she exclaim too long oh if you onli knew what
it is to me to have such guest as you ar in thi place and
her dark ey fill with tear
by now we had pass to the side of the hous in search of some
other flower that grew in the shade i think it wa mignonett
and were out of sight of the verandah and quit alon
mr quatermain she said hurriedli i am wonder whether to
ask your advic about someth if you would give it i have no
on to consult here she ad rather piteous
that is for you to decid if you wish to do so i am old enough
to be your father and will do my best to help
we walk on to an orang grove that stood about forti yard
awai ostens to pick some fruit but realli becaus we knew
that there we should be out of hear and could see ani on who
approach
mr quatermain she said present in a low voic i am in
great troubl almost the greatest a woman can have i am
engag to be marri to a man whom i do not care for
then why not break it off it mai be unpleas but it is
gener best to face unpleas thing and noth can be so
bad as marri a man whom you do notcar for
becaus i cannoti dare not i have to obei
how old ar you miss marnham
i shall be of ag in three month time you mai guess that i
did not intend to return here until thei were over but i wa
welltrap he wrote to me that my father wa ill and i
came
at ani rate when thei ar over you will not have to obei ani
on it is not long to wait
it is an etern besid thi is not so much a question of
obedi as of duti and of love i love my father who whatev
hi fault ha alwai been veri kind to me
and i am sure he love you why not go to him and tell him your
troubl
he know it alreadi mr quatermain and hate thi marriag
even more than i do if that is possibl but he is driven to
it as i am oh i must tell the truth the doctor ha some
hold over him my father ha done someth dread i dont
know what and i dont want to know but if it came out it would
ruin my father or wors wors i am the price of hi silenc
on the dai of our marriag he will destroi the proof if i
refus to marri him thei will be produc and then
it is difficult i said
it is more than difficult it is terribl if you could see all
there is in my heart you would know how terribl
i think i can see miss heda dont sai ani more now give me
time to consid in case of necess come to me again and be
sure that i will protect you
but you ar go in a week
mani thing happen in a week suffici to the dai is it
evil at the end of the week we will come to some decis
unless everyth is alreadi decid
for the next twentyfour hour i reflect on thi pretti problem
as hard as ever i did on anyth in all my life here wa a
young woman who must somehow be protect from a scoundrel but who
could not be protect becaus she herself had to protect anoth
scoundrelto wit her own father could the thing be face out
imposs for i wa sure that marnham had commit a murder
or murder of which rodd possess evid that would hang him
could heda be marri to anscomb at onc ye if both were
will but then marnham would still be hung could thei elop
possibl but with the same result could i take her awai and
put her under the protect of the court at pretoria ye but
with the same result i wonder what my hottentot retain
han would have advis he who wa name lightindark and
in hi own savag wai wa the cleverest and most cun man that
i have met ala i could not rais him from the grave to tell
me and yet i knew well what he would have answer
baa he would have said thi is a rope which onli the pale
old man ie death can cut let thi doctor die or let the
father die and the maiden will be free sure heaven is
long for on or both of them and if necessari baa i
believ that i can point out a path to heaven
i laugh to myself at the thought which wa on that a white
man could not entertain even as a thought and i felt that the
hypothet han wa right death alon could cut thi knot and
the reflect made me shiver
that night i slept uneasili and dream i dream that onc
more i wa in the black kloof in zululand seat in front of the
hut at the end of the kloof befor me squat the old wizard
zikali wrap up in hi karosszikali the
thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn whom i had not seen for
year near him were the ash of a fire by the help of which i
knew he had been practis divin he look up and laugh
on of hi terribl laugh
so you ar here again macumazahn he said grown older but
still the same here at the appoint hour what do you come to
seek from the open of road not mameena as i think thi time
no no it is she who seek you thi time macumazahn she found
you onc did she not far awai to the north among a strang
peopl who worship an ivori child a peopl of whom i knew in
my youth and afterward for wa not their prophet harut a
friend of mine and on of our brotherhood she found you beneath
the tusk of the eleph jana whom macumazahn the skil
could not hit oh do not look astonish
how do you know i ask in my dream
veri simpli macumazahn a littl yellow man name han ha
been with me and told me all the stori not an hour ago after
which i sent for mameena to learn if it were true she will be
glad to meet you macumazahn she who ha a hungri heart that
doe not forget oh dont be afraid i mean here beneath the
sun in the land beyond there will be no need for her to meet you
sinc she will dwell ever at your side
why do you lie to me zikali i seem to ask how can a dead
man speak to you and how can i meet a woman who is dead
seek the answer to that question in the hour of the battl when
the white men your brother fall beneath assegai as weed fall
befor the hoeor perhap befor it but have done with
mameena sinc she who never grow more old can well afford to
wait it is not of mameena that you came to speak to me it is
of a fair white woman name heddana you would speak and of the
man she love you who will ever be mix yourself up in
affair of other and therefor must bear their burden with no
pai save that of honour hearken for the time is short when
the storm burst upon them bring hither the fair maiden heddana
and the white lord mauriti and i will shelter them for your
sake take them nowher els bring them hither if thei would
escap troubl i shall be glad to see you macumazahn for at
last i am about to smite the zulu hous of senzangacona my foe
with a bladder full of blood and oh it stain their doorpost
red
then i woke up feel afraid as on doe after a nightmar
and wa comfort to hear anscomb sleep quietli on the other
side of the room
mauriti why did zikali call him mauriti i wonder drowsili
to myself oh of cours hi name is mauric and it wa a zulu
corrupt of a common sort as wa heddana of heda then i
doze off again and by the morn had forgotten all about my
dream until it wa brought back to me by subsequ event
still it wa thi and noth els that put it into my head to
fly to zululand on an emerg that wa to aris er long
for the histori of zikali and mameena see the book call
child of storm by h rider haggard
that even rodd wa absent from dinner and on inquir where
he might be i wa inform that he had ridden to visit a kaffir
headman a patient of hi who live at a distanc and would veri
probabl sleep at the kraal return earli next dai on of
the topic of convers dure dinner wa as to where the
exact boundari line us to run between the transvaal and the
countri over which the basuto chief sekukuni claim ownership
and jurisdict marnham said that it pass within a coupl of
mile of hi hous and when we rose the moon be veri bright
offer to show me where the beacon had been place year befor
by a boer commiss i accept as the night wa love for a
stroll after the hot dai also i wa half consciou of anoth
undefin purpos in my mind which perhap mai have spread to
that of marnham those two young peopl look veri happi
togeth there on the stoep and as thei must part so soon it
would i thought be kind to give them the opportun of a quiet
chat
so off we went to the brow of the hill on which the templ stood
whenc old marnham point out to me a beacon which i could not
see in the dim silveri bushveld below and how the line ran
from it to anoth beacon somewher els
you know the yellowwood swamp he said it pass straight
through that that is why those basuto who were follow you
pull up upon the edg of the swamp though as a matter of fact
accord to their idea thei had a perfect right to kill you on
their side of the line which cut through the middl
i made some remark to the effect that i presum that the line
had in fact ceas to exist at all as the basuto territori had
practic becom british after which we stroll back to the
hous walk quietli between the tall rose hedg and without
speak for each of us wa preoccupi with hi own thought
suddenli we came upon a veri pretti scene
we had left anscomb and heda seat side by side on the stoep
thei were still there but much closer togeth in fact hi
arm were round her and thei were kiss each other in a
remark wholeheart wai about thi there could be no
mistak sinc the rimpistrung couch on which thei sat wa
immedi under the hang lampa somewhat unfortun
situat for such endear but what did thei think of
hang lamp or ani other light save those of their own ey
thei who were content to kiss and murmur word of passion as
though thei were as much alon as adam and ev in eden what did
thei think either of the serpent coil about the bole of thi
tree of knowledg whereof thei had just pluck the ripe and
madden fruit
by a mutual instinct marnham and i withdrew ourselv veri
gentli inde purpos to skirt round the hous and enter it
from behind or to be seiz with a fit of cough at the gate
or to do someth to announc our presenc at a conveni
distanc when we had gone a littl wai we heard a crash in the
bush
anoth of those curs baboon rob the garden remark
marnham reflect
i think he is go to rob the hous also i repli turn
to point to someth dark that seem to be leap up on to the
verandah
next moment we heard heda utter a littl cry of alarm and a man
sai in a low fierc voic
so i have caught you at last have i
the doctor ha return from hi busi round sooner than wa
expect and i think that we had better join the parti i
remark and made a bee line for the stoep marnham follow
me
i think that i arriv just in time to prevent mischief there
with a revolv in hi hand stood rodd tall and formid hi
dark face look like that of satan himself a veri monument of
rage and jealousi there in front of him on the couch sat heda
grasp it edg with her finger her cheek as pale as a sheet
and her ey shine by her side wa anscomb cool and
collect as usual i notic but evid perplex
if there is ani shoot to be done he wa sai i think
you had better begin with me
hi calm seem to exasper rodd who lift the revolv
but i too wa prepar for in that hous i alwai went arm
there wa no time to get at the man who wa perhap fifteen feet
awai and i did not want to hurt him so i did the best i could
that is i fire at the pistol in hi hand and the light be
good struck it near the hilt and knock it off the barrel
befor the he could press the trigger if he realli meant to
shoot
that a good shot remark anscomb who had seen me while
rodd stare at the hilt which he still held
a lucki on i answer walk forward and now dr rodd
will you be so good as to tell me what you mean by flourish a
revolv presum load in the face of a ladi and an
unarm man
what the devil is that to you he ask furious and what do
you mean by fire at me
a great deal i answer see that a young woman and my
friend ar concern as for fire at you had i done so you
would not be ask question now i fire at the pistol in your
hand but if there is more troubl next time it shall be at the
holder and i glanc at my revolv
see that i meant busi he made no repli but turn upon
marnham who had follow me
thi is your work you old villain he said in a low voic that
wa heavi with hate you promis your daughter to me she is
engag to me and now i find her in thi wander arm
what have i to do with it said marnham perhap she ha
chang her mind you had better ask her

have got her nerv again i have chang my mind i never
love you dr rodd and i will not marri you i love mr
anscomb here and as he ha ask me to be hi wife i mean to

i see he sneer you want to be a peeress on dai no doubt
well you never shall if i can help it perhap too thi fine
gentleman of your will not be so particularli anxiou to marri
you when he learn that you ar the daughter of a murder
that word wa like a bombshel burst among us we look at
each other as peopl yet daze with the shock might on a
battlefield when the nois of the explos ha di and the
smoke clear awai to see who is still aliv anscomb spoke
the first
i dont know what you mean or to what you refer he said
quietli but at ani rate thi ladi who ha promis to marri me
is innoc and therefor if all her ancestor had been
murder it would not in the slightest turn me from my purpos
of marri her
she look at him and all the gratitud in the world shone in
her frighten ey marnham step or rather stagger
forward the blue vein throb on forehead
he li he said hoars tug at hi long beard listen
now and i will tell you the truth onc more than a year ago i
wa drunk and in a rage in thi state i fire at a kaffir to
frighten him and by some devil chanc shot him dead that
what he call be a murder
i have anoth tale said rodd with which i will not troubl
thi compani just now look here heda either you fulfil your
promis and marri me or your father swing
she gasp and sank togeth on the seat as though she had been
shot then i took up my parabl

see you have spent sever month in an english prison i gave
the name for a crime i wont mention

never mind i do know and the prison book will show it
further your busi is that of sell gun and ammunit to
the basuto of sekukuni tribe who although the expedit
against them ha been temporarili recal ar still the queen
enemi dont deni it for i have the proof further it wa

countri to shoot the other dai becaus you were afraid that we
should discov whenc he got hi gun thi wa a bow drawn
at a ventur but the arrow went home for i saw hi jaw drop
further i believ you to be an illicit diamond buyer and i
believ also that you have again been arrang with the basuto
to make an end of us though of these last two item at present i
lack posit proof now dr rodd i ask you for the second
time whether you ar a person to accus other of crime and
whether should you do so you will be consid a credibl
wit when your own ar brought to light
if i had been guilti of ani of these thing which i am not it is
obviou that my partner must have share in all of them except
the first so if you inform against me you inform against him
and the father of heda whom your friend wish to marri will
accord to your show be prove a gunrunn a thief and a
wouldb murder of hi guest i should advis you to leav
that busi alon mr quatermain
the repli wa bold and clever so much so that i regard thi
blackguard with a certain amount of admir as i answer
i shall take your advic if you take mine to leav anoth
busi alon that of thi young ladi and her father but not
otherwis
then spare your breath and do your worst onli care sharp as
you think yourself that your meddl doe not recoil on your
own head listen heda either you make up your mind to marri me
at onc and arrang that thi young gentleman who as a doctor i
assur you is now quit fit to travel without injuri to hi
health leav thi hous tomorrow with the spy quatermainy
might lend him the cape cart to go inor i start with the proof
to lai a charg of murder against your father i give you till

a pistol now let me see your foot and dont speak anoth word
to me about all thi busi tonight id rather tackl it
when i am clearhead in the morn
well i examin hi instep and leg veri carefulli and found
that rodd wa right although it still hurt him to walk the
wound wa quit heal and all inflamm had gone from the
limb now it wa onli a question of time for the sinew to right
themselv while i wa thu engag he held forth on the
virtu and charm of heda i make no comment
lie down and get to sleep if you can i said when i had
finish the door is lock and i am go on to the stoep so
you neednt be afraid of the window goodnight
i went out and sat myself down in such a posit that by the
light of the hang lamp which still burn i could make sure
that no on could approach either heda or my room without my
see him for the rest all my life i have been accustom to
night vigil and the load revolv hung from my wrist by a
loop of hide moreov never had i felt less sleepi there i
sat hour after hour think
the substanc of my thought doe not matter sinc the event
that follow make them superflu to the stori i will mere
record therefor that toward dawn a great horror took hold of
me i did not know of what i wa afraid but i wa much afraid
of someth noth wa pass in either heda or our room
of that i made sure by person examin therefor it would
seem that my terror were unnecessari and yet thei grew and
grew i felt sure that someth wa happen somewher a
dread occurr which it wa beyond my power to prevent though
whether it were in thi hous or at the other end of africa i did
not know
the mental depress increas and culmin then of a sudden
it pass complet awai and as i mop the sweat from off my
brow i notic that dawn wa break it wa a tender and
beauti dawn and in a dim wai i took it as a good omen of
cours it wa noth but the daili resurrect of the sun and
yet it brought to me comfort and hope the night wa past with
all it fear the light had come with all it joi from that
moment i wa certain that we should triumph over these
difficulti and that the end of them would be peac
so sure wa i that i ventur to take a nap know that the
slightest movement or sound would wake me i suppos i slept
until six oclock when i wa arous by a footfal i sprang
up and saw befor me on of our nativ servant he wa
trembl and hi face wa ashen beneath the black moreov he
could not speak all he did wa to put hi head on on side
like a dead man and keep on point downward then with hi
mouth open and start ey he beckon to me to follow him
i follow
chapter viii
rodd last card
the man led me to marnham room which i had never enter
befor all i could see at first for the shutter were close
wa that the place seem larg as bedchamb go in south
africa when my ey grew accustom to the light i made out
the figur of a man seat in a chair with hi head bent forward
over a tabl that wa place at the foot of the bed almost in the
centr of the room i threw open the shutter and the morn
light pour in the man wa marnham on the tabl were write
materi also a brandi bottl with onli a dreg of spirit in it
i look for the glass and found it by hi side on the floor

spoke for the first time sai in a frighten voic in dutch
no baa dead half cold i found him so just now
i bent down and examin marnham also felt hi face sure
enough he wa dead for hi jaw had fallen also hi flesh wa
chill and from him came a horribl smell of brandi i thought

larg envelop address allan quatermain esq in a somewhat
shaki hand thi i pick up and slip into my pocket
rodd arriv half dress

or reel back look as frighten as a man could be and
exclaim
dead as a stone by god dead these three hour or more
quit so i answer but what kill him
how should i know he ask savag do you suspect me of
poison him
my mind is open i repli but as you quarrel so bitterli
last night other might
the bolt went home he saw hi danger
probabl the old sot di in a fit or of too much brandi how
can on know without a postmortem but that mustnt be made by
me im off to inform the magistr and get hold of anoth
doctor let the bodi remain as it is until i return
i reflect quickli ought i to let him go or not if he had
ani hand in thi busi doubtless he intend to escap
well suppos thi were so and he did escape that would be a
good thing for heda and realli it wa no affair of mine to bring
the fellow to justic moreov there wa noth to show that
he wa guilti hi whole manner seem to point anoth wai
though of cours he might be act
veri well i repli but return as quickli as possibl
he stood for a few second like a man who is daze it occur
to me that it might have come into hi mind with marnham death
that he had lost hi hold over heda but if so he said noth
of it but onli ask
will you go instead of me
on the whole i think not i repli and if i did the stori i
should have to tell might not tend to your advantag
that true damn you he exclaim and left the room
ten minut later he wa gallop toward pilgrim rest
befor i depart from the death chamber i examin the place
carefulli to see if i could find ani poison or other deadli
thing but without success on thing i did discov howev
turn the leaf of a blottingbook that wa by marnham elbow
i came upon a sheet of paper on which were written these word in
hi hand greater love hath no man than thi that wa all
either he had forgotten the end of the quotat or chang hi
mind or wa unabl through weak to finish the sentenc
thi paper also i put in my pocket bolt the shutter and

psi should like to state clearli upon paper that my earnest
hope and wish ar that heda mai get clear of that blackheart
murder scoundrel rodd and marri mr anscomb whom i like and

have wish that i should do so it wa short but properli
drawn sign and wit and bequeath a sum of 9000
which wa on deposit at the standard bank togeth with all hi
other properti real and person to heda for her own sole us
free from the debt and engag of her husband should she
marri also she wa forbidden to spend more than 1000 of the
capit in short the monei wa strictli ti up with the will
were some other paper that appar refer to certain
properti in hungari to which heda might becom entitl but
about these i did not troubl
replac these document in a safe inner pocket in the line of
my waistcoat i went into our room and woke up anscomb who wa
sleep soundli a fact that caus an unreason irrit
in my mind when at length he wa thoroughli arous i said to
him

break her heart
if it break half of her heart i repli it will mend the
other half for now her filial affect cant forc her to marri

nor will you if you ar wise unless knowledg is forc upon
you it is enough that he is dead and for hi daughter sake

there sat the dead man as i had left him onli hi head had
fallen over a littl she gaze at him trembl then advanc
and kiss hi cold forehead mutter

so with a groan i consign all these valuabl to my capaci
pocket then i lock up the empti safe replac the kei
where i had found them on marnham fasten the shutter and left
the room with anscomb wait for a while outsid till heda
join us sob a littl after thi we got someth to eat
insist on heda do the same
on leav the tabl i saw a curiou sight name the patient
whom rodd wa attend in the littl hospit of which i have
spoken depart toward the bushveld those of them who could
walk well and the attend assist the other thei were
alreadi some distanc awai too far inde for me to follow as i
did not wish to leav the hous the incid fill me with
suspicion and i went round to the back to make inquiri but
could find no on as i pass the hospit door howev i
heard a voic call in sisutu
do not leav me behind my brother
i enter and saw the man on whom rodd had oper the dai of
our arriv ly in bed and quit alon i ask him where the
other had gone at first he would not answer but when i
pretend to leav him call out that it wa back to their own
countri final to cut the stori short i extract from him
that thei had left becaus thei had new that the templ wa
go to be attack by sekukuni and did not wish to be here when
i and anscomb were kill how the new reach him he refus
or could not sai nor did he seem to know anyth of the death
of marnham when i press him on the former point he onli
groan and cri for water for he wa in pain and thirsti i
ask him who had told sekukuni peopl to kill us but he
refus to speak
veri well i said then you shall lie here alon and die of
thirst and again i turn toward the door
at thi he cri out
i will tell you it wa the white medicineman who live here
he who cut me open he arrang it all a few dai ago becaus he
hate you last night he rode to tell the impi when to come
when is it to come i ask hold the jug of water toward
him
tonight at the rise of the moon so that it mai get far awai
befor the dawn my peopl ar thirsti for your blood and for
that of the other white chief becaus you kill so mani of them
by the river the other thei will not harm
how did you learn all thi i ask him again but without
result for he becam incoher and onli mutter someth
about be left alon becaus the other could not carri him
so i gave him some water after which he fell asleep or
pretend to do so and i left him wonder whether he wa
deliri or spoke truth as i pass the stabl i saw that my
own hors wa there for in thi district hors ar alwai shut
up at night to keep them from catch sick but that the
four beast that had brought heda from natal in the cape cart
were gone though it wa evid that thei had been kraal here
till within an hour or two i threw my hors a bundl of forag
and return to the hous by the back entranc the kitchen wa
empti but crouch by the door of marnham room sat the boi who
had found him dead he had been attach to hi master and
seem half daze i ask him where the other servant were to
which he repli that thei had all run awai then i ask him
where the hors were he answer that the baa rodd had
order them to be turn out befor he rode off that morn i
bade him accompani me to the stoep as i dare not let him out of
my sight which he did unwillingli enough
there i found anscomb and heda thei were seat side by side
upon the couch tear were run down her face and he look
veri troubl held her by the hand somehow that pictur of
heda ha alwai remain fix in my mind sorrow becom some
women and she wa on of them her beauti dark grei ey did
not grow red with weep the tear just well up in them and
fell like dewdrop from the heart of a flower
she sat veri upright and veri still as he did look straight
in front of her while a rai of sunshin fall on her head
show the chestnuthu light in her wave hair of which she
had a great abund
inde the pair of them thu seat side by side remind me of
an engrav i had seen somewher of the statu of a husband and
wife in an old egyptian tomb with just such a look did the
woman of thousand of year ago sit gaze in patient hope into
the dark of the futur death had made her sad but it wa
gone by and the littl wist smile about her lip seem to
suggest that in thi dark her sorrow ey alreadi saw the
stir of the new life to be moreov wa not the man she
love the companion of her hope as he had been of her woe
such wa the fanci thought that sprang up in my mind even in
the midst of those great anxieti like a singl flower in a
stoni wilder of thorn or on star on the black of the
night
in a moment it had gone and i wa tell them of what i had
learn thei listen till i had finish then anscomb said
slowli
two of us cant hold thi hous against an impi we must get
out of it
both your conclus seem quit sound i remark that is if
yonder old kaffir is tell the truth but the question
ishow we cant all three of us ride on on nag as you ar
still a crippl
there is the cape cart suggest heda
ye but the hors have been turn out and i dont know where
to look for them nor dare i send that boi alon for probabl
he would bolt like the other i think that you had better get
on my hors and ride for it leav us to take our chanc i
daresai the whole thing is a lie and that we shall be in no
danger i ad by wai of soften the suggest
that i will never do she repli with so much quiet convict
that i saw it wa useless to pursu the argument
i thought for a moment as the posit wa veri difficult the
boi wa not to be trust and if i went with him i should be
leav these two alon and in anscomb state almost
defenceless still it seem as though i must just then i
look up and there at the garden gate saw anscomb driver
footsack the man whom i had despatch to pretoria to fetch hi
oxen i note that he look frighten and wa breathless for
hi ey start out of hi head also hi hat wa gone and he
bled a littl from hi face
see us he ran up the path and sat down as though he were
tire
where ar the oxen i ask
oh baa he answer the basuto have got them we heard
from an old black woman that sekukuni had an impi out so we
wait on the top of that hill about an hour ride awai to see
if it wa true then suddenli the doctor baa appear ride
and i ran out and ask him if it were safe to go on he knew me
again and answer
ye quit safe for have i not just ridden thi road without
meet so much as a black child go on man your master will
be glad to have their oxen as thei wish to trek or will by
nightfal then he laugh and rode awai
so we went on drive the oxen but when we came to the belt
of thorn at the bottom of the hill we found that the doctor
baa had either li to us or he had not seen for there
suddenli the tall grass on either side of the path grew spear
ye everywher were spear in a minut the two voorloop
were assegai as for me i ran forward not back sinc the
kaffir were behind me across the path baa drive off the
oxen thei sprang at me but i jump thi wai and that wai and
avoid them then thei threw assegaisse on of them cut my
cheek but the rest miss thei had gun in their hand also
but none shot i think thei did not wish to make a nois onli
on of them shout after me
tell macumazahn that we ar go to call on him tonight when
he cannot see to shoot we have a messag for him from our
brother whom he kill at the drift of the oliph river
then i ran on here without stop but i saw no more kaffir
that is all baa
now i did not delai to crossexamin the man or to sift the true
from the fals in hi stori sinc it wa clear to me that he had
run into a compani of basuto or rather been beguil thereto by
rodd and lost our cattl also hi companion who were either
kill as he said or had escap some other wai
listen man i said i am go to fetch some hors do you
stai here and help the missi to pack the cart and make the
har readi if you disobei me or run awai then i will find
you and you will never run again do you understand
he vow that he did and went to get some water while i
explain everyth to anscomb and heda point out that all
the inform we could gather seem to show that no attack wa
to be made upon the hous befor nightfal and that therefor we
had the dai befor us as thi wa so i propos to go to look
for the hors myself sinc otherwis i wa sure we should never
find them meanwhil heda must pack and make readi the cart with
the help of footsack anscomb superintend everyth as he
could veri well do sinc he wa now abl to walk lean on a
stick
of cours neither of them like my leav them but in view of
our necess thei rais no object so off i went take
the boi with me he did not want to go be as i have said
half daze with grief or fear or both but when i had point
out to him clearli that i wa quit prepar to shoot him if he
plai trick he chang hi mind have saddl my mare that
wa now fresh and fat we start the boi guid me to a
certain kloof at the foot of which there wa a small plain of
good grass where he said the hors were accustom to graze
here sure enough we found two of them and as thei had been
turn out with their headstal on were abl to tie them to
tree with the riem which were attach to the headstal but
the other were not there and as two hors could not drag a
heavi cape cart i wa oblig to continu the search oh what
a hunt those beast gave me find themselv free for as
rodd object wa that thei should strai he had order the
stableboi not to kneelhalt them after fill themselv
with grass thei had start off for the farm where thei were
bred which it seem wa about fifti mile awai graze as
thei went of cours i did not know thi at the time so for
sever hour i rode up and down the neighbour kloof as the
ground wa too hard for me to hope to follow them by their spoor
it occur to me to ask the boi where the hors came from a
question that he happen to be abl to answer as he had brought
them home when thei were bought the year befor have learn
in what direct the place lai i rode for it at an angl or
rather for the path that led to it make the boi run alongsid
hold to my stirrup leather about three oclock in the
afternoon i struck thi path or rather track at a point ten or
twelv mile awai from the templ and there just mount a
rise met the two hors quietli walk toward me had i been
a quarter of an hour later thei would have pass and vanish
into a sea of thornveld we caught them without troubl and
onc more head homeward lead them by their riem
reach the glade where the other two were ti up we collect
them also and return to the hous where we arriv at five
oclock as everyth seem quiet i put my mare into the
stabl slip it bit and gave it some forag then i went
round the hous and to my great joi found anscomb and heda
wait anxious but with noth to report and with them
footsack veri hastili i swallow some food while footsack
inspan the hors in a quarter of an hour all wa readi
then suddenli in an inconsequ femal fashion heda develop
a dislik to leav her father unburi
my dear young ladi i said it seem that you must choos
between that and our all stop to be buri with him
she saw the point and compromis upon pai him a visit of
farewel which i left her to do in anscomb compani while i
fetch my mare to tell the truth i felt as though i had seen
enough of the unhappi marnham and not for 50 would i have
enter that room again as i pass the door of the hospit
lead my hors i heard the old kaffir scream within and
sent the boi who wa with me to find out what wa the matter with
him that wa the last i saw of either of them or ever shall
see thi side of kingdom come i wonder what becam of them
when i got back to the front of the hous i found the cart
stand readi at the gate footsack at the head of the hors
and heda with anscomb at her side it had been neatli pack
dure the dai by heda with such of her and our belong as it
would hold includ our arm and ammunit the rest of
cours we were oblig to abandon also there were two basket
full of food some bottl of brandi and a good suppli of
overcoat and wrap i told footsack to take the rein as i
knew him to be a good driver and help anscomb to a seat at
hi side while heda and the maid kaatj got in behind in order
to balanc the vehicl i determin to ride at ani rate for
the present
which wai baa ask footsack
down to the granit stream where the wagon stand i answer
that will be through the yellowwood swamp cant we take the
other road to pilgrim rest and lydenburg or to barberton
ask anscomb in a vagu wai and as i thought rather
nervous
no i answer that is unless you wish to meet those basuto
who stole the oxen and dr rodd return if he mean to
return
oh let us go through the yellowwood exclaim heda who i
think would rather have met the devil than dr rodd
ah if i had but known that we were head straight for that
person sooner would i have face the basuto twice over but i
did what seem wisest think that he would be sure to return
with anoth doctor or a magistr by the shorter and easier
path which he had follow in the morn it just show onc
more how useless ar all our care and foresight or how strong is
fate have it which wai you will
so we start down the slope and i ride behind note poor
heda stare at the marbl hous which grew ever more beauti
as it reced and the rough of it build disappear
especi at that part of it which hid the bodi of her old scamp
of a father whom still she love we came down to the glen and
onc more saw the bone of the blue wildebeest that we had
shotoh year and year ago or so it seem then we struck
out for the granit stream
befor we reach the patch of yellowwood forest where i knew
that the cart must travel veri slowli becaus of the tree and
the swampi natur of the ground i push on ahead to
reconnoitr fear lest there might be basuto hidden in thi
cover ride straight through it i went as far as the desert
wagon at a sharp canter see noth and no on onc inde
toward the end of the wood where it wa more dens i thought
that i heard a man cough and peer about me through the gloom
for here the rai of the sun which wa get low in the
heaven scarc penetr as i could perceiv no on i came
to the conclus that i must have been deceiv by my fanci or
perhap it wa some baboon that cough though it wa strang
that a baboon should have come to such a lowli spot where
there wa noth for it to eat
the place wa eeri so much so that i bethought me of tale of
the ghost wherebi it wa suppos to be haunt also oddli
enough of anscomb presenti which he had fulfil by
kill a basuto look there lai hi grin skull with some
patch of hair still on it drag awai from the rest of the
bone by a hyena i canter on down the slope beyond the wood
and through the scatter thorn to the stream on the bank of
which the wagon should be it had gone and by the fresh of
the trail within an hour or two a moment reflect told me
what had happen have stolen our oxen the basuto drove them
to the wagon inspan them and depart with their loot on
the whole i wa glad to see thi sinc it suggest that thei
had retir toward their own countri leav our road open
turn my hors i rode back again to meet the cart as i
reach the edg of the wood at the top of the slope i heard a
whistl blown a veri shrill whistl of which the sound would
travel for a mile or two on that still air also i heard the
sound of men voic in alterc and caught word such
aslet go or by heaven then a furiou laugh and other
word which seem to bein five minut the kaffir will be
here in ten you will be dead can i help it if thei kill you
after i have warn you to turn back then a woman scream
rodd voic anscomb voic and kaatj screamnot heda
but kaatj
then as i rode furious round the last patch of interven
tree the sound of a pistol shot i wa out of them now and saw
everyth there wa the cart on the further side of a swamp
the hors were stand still and snort hold the rein of
on of the leader wa rodd whose hors also stood close by he
wa rock on hi feet and as i leapt from my mare and ran up i
saw hi face it wa horribl full of pain and devilish rage
with hi disengag hand he point to anscomb sit in the
cart and grasp a pistol that still smoke
youv kill me he said in a hoars choke voic for he
wa shot through the lung to get her and he wave hi hand
toward heda who wa peer at him between the head of the two
men you ar a murder as her father wa and as david wa
befor you well i hope you wont keep her long i hope youll
die as i do and break her fals heart you damn thief
all of thi he said in a slow voic paus between the word
and speak ever more thickli as the blood from hi wound choke
him then of a sudden it burst in a stream from hi lip and
still point with an accus finger at anscomb he fell
backward into the slimi pool behind him and there vanish
without a struggl
so horribl wa the sight that the driver footsack leapt from
the cart utter a kind of low howl ran to rodd hors
scrambl into the saddl and gallop off strike it with hi
fist where to i do not know anscomb put hi hand befor hi
ey heda sank down on the seat in a heap and the colour
woman kaatj beat her breast and said someth in dutch about
be accurs or bewitch luckili i kept my wit and went to
the hors head fear lest thei should start and drag the
trap into the pool wake up i said that fellow ha onli
got what he deserv and you were quit right to shoot him
i am glad you think so answer anscomb absent it wa so
like murder dont you rememb i told you i should kill a man
in thi place and about a woman
i rememb noth i answer boldli except that if we stop
here much longer we shall have those basuto on us that brute
wa whistl to them and hold the hors till thei came to
kill us pull yourself togeth take the rein and follow me
he obei be a skil whip enough who as he inform me
afterward had been accustom to drive a fourinhand at home
mount my hors which stood by i guid the cart out of the
wood and down the slope beyond till at length we came to our old
outspan where i propos to turn on to the wagon track which ran
to pilgrim rest i sai propos for when i look up it i
perceiv about five hundr yard awai a number of arm basuto
run toward us the red light of the sunset shine on their
spear evid the scout or spy to whom rodd whistl had
call them out of their ambush which thei had set for us on the
pilgrim rest road in order that thei might catch us if we tri
to escap that wai
now there wa onli on thing to be done at thi spot a nativ
track ran across the littl stream and up a steepish slope
beyond on the first occas of our outspan here i had the
curios to mount thi slope reflect as i did so that
although rough it would be quit practic for a wagon at the
top of it i found a wide flat plain almost highveld for the
bush were veri few across which the track ran on on
subsequ inquiri i discov that it wa on us by the
swazi and other nativ when thei made their raid upon the
basuto or when bodi of them went to work in the mine
follow me i shout and cross the stream which wa shallow
between the littl pool then led the wai up the stoni slope
the four hors negoti it veri well and the cape cart be
splendidli built took no harm at the top i look back and saw
that the basuto were follow us
flog the hors i cri to anscomb and off we went at a hand
gallop along the nativ track the cart swai and bump upon
the rough veld the sun wa set now in half an hour it
would be quit dark
could we keep ahead of them for that half hour
chapter ix
flight
the sun sank in a blaze of glori look back by the light of
it last rai i saw a singl nativ silhouet against the red
sky he wa stand on a mound that we had pass a mile or
more behind us doubtless wait for hi companion whom he had
outrun so thei had not given up the chase what wa to be
done onc it wa complet dark we could not go on we should
lose our wai the hors would get into antbear hole and break
their leg perhap we might becom bog in some hollow
therefor we must wait till the moon rose which would not be for
a coupl of hour
meanwhil those accurs basuto would be follow us even in
the dark thi would hamper them no doubt but thei would keep
the path with which thei were probabl familiar beneath their
feet and what is more the ground be soft with recent rain
thei could feel the wheel spoor with their finger i look
about me just here anoth track start off in a norwesterli
direct from that which we were follow perhap it ran to
lydenburg i do not know to our left not more than a hundr
yard or so awai the higher veld came to an end and slope in an
easterli direct down to bushland below
should i take the westerli road which ran over a great plain
no for then we might be seen for mile and cut off moreov
even if we escap the nativ wa it desir we should plung
into civil just now and tell all our stori as in that
case we must do rodd death wa quit justifi but it had
happen on transvaal territori and would requir a deal of
explan fortun there wa no wit of it except
ourselv ye there wa thoughth driver footsack if he had
got awai which be mount would seem probabl a man who
for my part i would not trust for a moment it would be an ugli
thing to see anscomb in the dock charg with murder and
possibl myself with footsack give evid against us befor
a boer juri who might be hard on englishmen also there wa the
bodi with a bullet in it
suddenli there came into my mind a recollect of the veri vivid
dream of zikali which had visit me and i reflect that in
zululand there would be littl need to troubl about the death of
rodd but zululand wa a long wai off and if we were to avoid
the transvaal there wa onli on wai of go there name
through swaziland well among the swazi we should be quit
safe from the basuto sinc the two peopl were at fierc
enmiti moreov i knew the swazi chief and king veri well
have trade there and could explain that i came to collect
debt ow to me
there wa anoth difficulti i had heard that the troubl
between the english govern and cetewayo the zulu king wa
come to a head and that the high commission sir bartl
frere talk of present him with an ultimatum it would be
awkward if thi arriv while we were in the countri though even
so be on such friendli term with the zulu of all class i
did not think that i or ani with me would run great risk
all these thought rush through my brain while i consid
what to do at the moment it wa useless to ask the opinion of
the other who were but children in nativ matter i and i
alon must take the respons and act prai that i might
do so aright anoth moment and i had made up my mind
sign to anscomb to follow me i rode about a hundr yard or
more down the norwesterli path then i turn sharpli along a
rather stoni ridg of ground the cart follow me all the time
and came back across our own track my object be of cours
to puzzl ani kaffir who might spoor us now we were on the
edg of the gentl slope that led down to the bushveld over
thi i rode toward a desert cattl kraal built of stone in
the rich soil of which grew sundri tree doubtless on of those
which had been abandon when mosilikatz swept all thi countri
on hi wai north about the year 1838 the wai to it wa easi
sinc the surround stone had been collect to build the
kraal gener befor as we pass over the edg of the
slope in the gather gloom heda cri
look and point in the direct whenc we came far awai a
sheet of flame shot upward
the hous is burn she exclaim
ye i said it can be noth els ad to myself a
good job too for now there will be no postmortem on old
marnham
who fire the place i never learnt it mai have been the
basuto or marnham bodyserv or footsack or a spark from
the kitchen fire at ani rate it blaze merrili enough
notwithstand the marbl wall as a woodlin and thatch
build of cours would do on the whole i suspect the boi
who mai veri well have fear lest he should be accus of have
had a hand in hi master death at least it wa gone and
watch the distant flame i bethought me that with it went all
heda past twentyfour hour befor her father wa aliv the
bondserv of rodd and a crimin now he wa ash and rodd
wa dead while she and the man she love were free with all the
world befor them i wish that i could have ad that thei
were safe afterward she told me that much the same idea
pass through her own mind
dismount i led the hors into the old kraal through the gap
in the wall which onc had been the gatewai it wa a larg
kraal that probabl in bygon dai had held the cattl of some
forgotten head chief whose town would have stood on the brow of
the rise so larg that notwithstand the tree i have
mention there wa plenti of room for the cart and hors in
it centr moreov on such soil the grass grew so richli that
after we had slip their bit the hors were abl to fill
themselv without be unhar also a littl stream from
a spring on the brow ran within a few yard whenc with the help
of kaatj a strong woman i water them with the bucket which
hung underneath the cart next we drank ourselv and at some
food in the dark that wa now complet then leav kaatj
to stand at the head of the hors in case thei should attempt
ani sudden movement i climb into the cart and we discuss
thing in low whisper
it wa a curiou debat in that intens gloom which close as our
face were togeth prevent us from see anyth of each
other except onc when a sudden flare of summer lightn
reveal them white and unnatur as those of ghost on our
present danger i did not dwell put them asid lightli
though i knew thei were not light but of the altern as to
whether we should try to escap to lydenburg and civil or
to zululand and savageri i felt it to be my duti to speak
to put it plainli said anscomb in hi slow wai when i had
finish you mean that in the transvaal i might be tri as a
murder and perhap convict wherea if we vanish into
zululand the probabl is that thi would not happen
i mean i whisper back that we might both be tri and if
footsack should chanc to appear and give evid find
ourselv in an awkward posit also there is anoth
witnesskaatj and for the matter of that heda herself of
cours her evid would be in our favour but to make it
understood by a juri she would have to explain a great deal of
which she might prefer not to speak further at the best the
whole busi would get into the english paper which you and
your rel might think disagre especi in view of
the fact that as i understand you and heda intend to marri
still i think that i would rather face it out he said in hi
outspoken wai even if it should mean that i could never return
to england after all of what have i to be afraid i shot thi
scoundrel becaus i wa oblig to do so
ye but it is of thi that you mai have to convinc a juri who
might possibl find a motiv in rodd past and your present
relationship to the same ladi but what ha she to sai
i have to sai whisper heda that for myself i care noth
but that i could never bear to see all these stori about my
poor father rake up also there is mauric to be consid
it would be terribl if thei put him in prisonor wors let us
go to zululand mr quatermain and afterward get out of africa
dont you agre mauric
what doe mr quatermain think himself he answer he is
the oldest and by far the wisest of us and i will be guid by
him
now i consid and said
there is such a thing as fly from present troubl to other
that mai be wors the ill we know not of zululand is
disturb if war broke out there we might all be kill on
the other hand we might not and it ought to be possibl for you
to work up to delagoa bai and there get some ship home that is
if you wish to keep clear of british law i cannot do so as i
must stai in africa nor can i take the respons of
settl what you ar to do sinc if thing went wrong it would
be on my head howev if you decid for the transvaal or natal
and we escap i must tell you that i shall go to the first
magistr we find and make a full deposit of all that ha
happen it is not possibl for me to live with the charg of
have been concern in the shoot of a white man hang over
me that might be brought up at ani time perhap when no on wa
left in the countri to give evid on my behalf for then even
if i were acquit my name would alwai be tarnish in
zululand on the other hand there ar no magistr befor whom
i could depos and if thi busi should come out i can
alwai sai that we went there to escap from the basuto now i
am go to get down to see if the hors ar all right do you
two talk the thing over and make up your mind whatev you
agre on i shall accept and do my best to carri through then
without wait for an answer i slip from the cart
have examin the hors who were crop all the grass
within reach of them i crept to the wall of the kraal so as to
be quit out of earshot the night wa now pitch dark dark as
it onli know how to be in africa more a thunderstorm wa
come up of which that flash of sheet lightn had been a
presag the air wa electr from the vast bushclad vallei
beneath us came a wild moan sound caus i suppos by wind
among the tree though here i felt none far awai a sudden spear
of lightn stab the sky the brood troubl of natur
spread to my own heart i wa afraid and not of our present
danger though these were real enough so real that in a few
hour we might all be dead
to danger i wa accustom for year thei had been my daili
food by dai and by night and as i think i have said elsewher
i am a fatalist on who know full well that when god want me
he will take me that is if he can want such a poor er
creatur noth that i did or left undon could postpon or
hasten hi summon for a moment though of cours i knew it to be
my duti to fight against death and to avoid it for as long as i
might becaus that i should do so wa a portion of hi plan
for we ar all part of a great pattern and the continu or
cessat of our live react upon other live and therefor
life is a trust
no it wa of greater thing that i felt afraid thing terribl
and immin which i could not grasp and much less understand i
understand them now but who would have guess that on the issu
of that whisper colloqui in the cart behind me depend the
fate of a peopl and mani thousand of live as i wa to learn
in dai to come if anscomb and heda had determin upon head
for the transvaal there would as i believ have been no zulu
war which in it turn meant that there would have been no boer
rebellion and that the mysteri cours of histori would have
been chang
i shook myself togeth and return to the cart
well i whisper but there wa no answer a moment later
there came anoth flash of lightn
there said heda how mani do you make it
ninetyeight he answer
i count ninetynin she said but anywai it wa within the
hundr mr quatermain we will go to zululand if you pleas
if you will show us the wai there
right i answer but might i ask what that ha to do with
your both count a hundr
onli thi she said we could not make up our mind mauric
wa for the transvaal i wa for zululand so you see we agre
that if anoth flash came befor we count a hundr we would
go to zululand and if it didnt to pretoria a veri good wai
of settl wasnt it
excel i repli quit excel for those who could
think of such a thing
as a matter of fact i dont know which of them thought of it
becaus i never inquir but i did rememb afterward how
anscomb had toss with a lucki penni when it wa a question
whether we should or should not run for the wagon dure our
difficulti by the oliph river also when i ask him the
reason for thi strang proceed he answer that provid
might inhabit a penni as well as anyth els and that he
wish to give iti mean providencea chanc how much more
then he mai have argu could it inhabit a flash of lightn
which ha alwai been consid a divin manifest from the
time of the roman jove and no doubt far befor him
forti or fifti gener ago which is not long our ancestor
set great store by the behaviour of lightn and thunder and
doubtless the instinct is still in our blood in the same wai
that all our exist superstit about the moon come down to
us from the time when our forefath worship her thei did
thi for ten of hundr or thousand of year and can we
expect a few coat of the veneer that we polit call
civil which after all is onli on of our convent that
vanish in ani human stress such as war to kill out the human
impuls it seem to hide i do not know though i have my own
opinion and probabl these young peopl never reason the
matter out thei just act on an intuit as ancient as that
which had attract them to each other name a desir to
consult the rule fate by omen or symbol or perhap
anscomb thought that as hi experi with the penni had prove
so success he would give provid anoth chanc if so
it took it and no mistak confound it i dont know what he
thought i onli dwell on the matter becaus of the great result
which follow thi consult of the sybillin book of
heaven
as it happen my specul if i realli indulg in ani at
that time were suddenli extinguish by the burst of the
storm it wa of the usual charact short but veri violent
of a sudden the sky becam aliv with lightn and the
atmospher with the roar of wind on flash struck a tree quit
near the kraal and i saw that tree seem to melt in it fieri
embrac while about where it had been rose a column of dust
from the ground beneath the hors were so frighten that
luckili thei stood quit quiet as i have often known anim to
do in such circumst then came the rain a torrenti rain
as i who wa out in it hold the hors becam painfulli
awar it thin after a while howev as the storm roll
awai
suddenli in a silenc between the tremend echo of the
pass thunder i thought that i heard voic somewher on the
brow of the slope and as the hors were now quit calm i crept
through the tree to that part of the enclosur which i judg to
be nearest to them
voic thei were sure enough and of the basuto who were
pursu us what wa more thei were come down the slope
the top of the old wall reach almost to my chin take off my
hat i thrust my head forward between two loos stone that i
might hear the better
the men were talk togeth in sisutu on whom i took to be
their captain said to the other
that whitehead old jackal macumazahn ha given us the slip
again he doubl on hi track and drove the hors down the
hillsid to the lower path in the vallei i could feel where the
wheel went over the edg
it is so father answer anoth voic but we shall catch
him and the other at the bottom if we get there befor the moon
rise sinc thei cannot have move far in thi rain and
dark let me go first and guid you who know everi tree and
stone upon thi slope where i us to herd cattl when i wa a
child
do so said the captain i can see noth now the lightn
ha gone and were it not that i have sworn to dip my spear in
the blood of macumazahn who ha fool us again i would give up
the hunt
i think it would be better to give it up in ani case said a
third voic sinc it is known throughout the land that no luck
ha ever come to those who tri to trap the watcherbynight
oh he is a leopard who spring and is gone again how mani ar
the throat in which hi fang have met leav him alon i sai
lest our fate should be that of the white doctor in the
yellowwood swamp he who set us on thi hunt we have hi wagon
and hi cattl let us be satisfi
i will leav him alon when he sleep for the last time and not
befor answer the captain he who shot my brother in the
drift the other dai what would sekukuni sai if we let him
escap to bring the swazi on us moreov we want that white
maiden for a hostag in case the english should attack us again
come you who know the road and lead us
there wa some disturb as thi man pass to the front then
i heard the line move forward present thei were go by the
wall within a foot or two of me inde by illluck just as we
were opposit to each other the captain stumbl and fell against
the wall
there is an old cattl kraal here he said what if those
white rat have hidden in it
i trembl as i heard the word if a hors should neigh or make
ani nois that could be heard abov the hiss of the rain i did
not dare to move for fear lest i should betrai myself there i
stood so close to the kaffir that i could smell them and hear
the rain patter on their bodi onli veri stealthili i drew
my hunt knife with my right hand at that moment the
lightn which i thought had quit gone by flash again for
the last time reveal the fat face of the basuto captain
within a foot of my own for he wa turn toward the wall on
which on of hi hand rest moreov the blue and ghastli
light reveal mine to him thrust forward between the two stone
my ey glare at him
the head of a dead man is set upon the wall he cri in
terror it is the ghost of
he got no further for as the last word pass hi lip i drove
the knife at him with all my strength deep into hi throat he
fell back into the arm of hi follow and next instant i
heard the sound of mani feet rush in terror down the hill
what becam of him i do not know but if he still live probabl
he agre with hi tribesman that macumazahnwatcherbynight
or hi ghost is a leopard who spring and kill and is gone
again also that those who try to trap him meet with no luck
i sai or hi ghostbecaus i am sure he thought that i wa a
spirit of the dead doubtless i must have look like on with my
white raindrown face appear there between the stone and
made ghastli and livid by the lightn
well thei had gone the whole band of them not less than thirti
or forti men so i went also back to the cart where i found the
other veri comfort inde beneath the rainproof tilt
sai noth of what had happen of which thei were as
innoc as babe i took a stiff tot of brandi for i wa
chill through by the wet and while wait for the moon to
rise busi myself with get the bit back into the hors
mouthsan awkward job in the dark at length it appear in a
clear sky for the storm had quit depart and the rain ceas
as soon as there wa light enough i took the near leader by the
bridl and led the cart to the brow of the hill which wa not
easi under the condit make kaatj follow with my hors
then as there were no sign of ani basuto we start on again
i ride about a hundr yard ahead keep a sharp lookout
for a possibl ambush fortun howev the veld wa bare
and open consist of long wave of ground on start i did
get think that i saw men head just on the crest of a wave
which turn out to be onli a herd of springbuck feed among
the tussock of grass i wa veri glad to see them sinc their
presenc assur me that no human be had recent pass that
wai
all night long we trek follow the kaffir path for as long
as i could see it and after that go by my compass i knew
whereabout the drift of the crocodil river should be as i had
cross it twice befor in my life and kept my ey open for a
certain tall koppi which stood within half a mile it on the swazi
side of the river ultim to my joi i caught sight of thi hill
faintli outlin against the sky and head for it half a mile
further on i struck a wagontrack made by boer trek into
swaziland to trade or shoot then i knew that the drift wa
straight ahead of us and call to anscomb to flog up the
weari hors
we reach the river just befor the dawn to my horror it wa
veri full so full that the drift look danger for it had
been swollen by the thunderrain of the previou night inde
some wander swazi on the further bank shout to us that we
should be drown if we tri to cross
which mean that the onli thing to do is to stai until the water
run down i said to anscomb for the two women tire out
were asleep
i suppos so he answer unless those basuto
i look back up the long slope down which we had come and saw no
on then i rais myself in my stirrup and look along
anoth track that join the road just here lead from the
bushveld as our led from the highveld the sun wa rise
now dispers the mist that hung about the tree after the wet
search among these with my ey present i perceiv the
light gleam upon what i knew must be the point of spear
project abov the level of the ground vapour
those devil ar after us by the lower road i said to
anscomb ad i heard them pass the old cattl kraal last
night thei follow our spoor over the edg of the hill but in
the dark lost it among the stone
he whistl and ask what wa to be done
that is for you to decid i answer for my part id rather
risk the river than the basuto and i look at the slumber
heda
can we bolt back the wai we came allan
the hors ar veri spent and we might meet more basuto and
again i look at heda
a hard choic allan it is wonder how women complic
everyth in life becaus thei ar life i suppos he
thought a moment and went on let try the river if we fail
it will be soon over and it is better to drown than be spear
or be kept aliv by savag who hate us i exclaim with my
ey still fix upon heda
then i got to busi there were hide riem on the bridl of
the leader i undid these and knot their loos end firmli
togeth to them i made fast the riem of my own mare slip
a loop i ti in it over my right hand and sai
now i will go first lead the hors do you drive after me
for all you ar worth even if thei ar swept off their feet i
can trust my beast to swim straight and be a mare i hope
that the hors will follow her as thei have done all night
wake up heda and kaatj
he nod and look veri pale said
heda my dear i am sorri to disturb you but we have to get over
a river with a rough bottom so you and kaatj must hang on and
sit tight dont be frighten you ar as safe as a church
god forgiv him for that lie thought i to myself as have
tighten the girth i mount my mare then grip the riem
i kick the beast to a canter anscomb flog up the team as
we swung down the bank to the edg of the foam torrent on the
further side of which the swazi shout and gesticul to us
to go back
we were in it now for as i had hope the hors follow the
mare without hesit for the first twenti yard or so all
went well i head up the stream then suddenli i felt that
the mare wa swim
flog the hors and dont let them turn i shout to anscomb
ten more yard and i glanc over my shoulder the team wa
swim also and behind them the cart rock and bob like a
boat swing in a heavi sea there came a strain on the riem
the leader were try to turn i pull hard and encourag
them with my voic while anscomb who drove splendidli kept
their head as straight as he could mercifulli thei came round
again and struck out for the further shore the waterlog cart
float after them would it turn over that wa the question
in my mind five second ten second and it wa still upright
oh it wa go no a fierc back eddi caught it and set it
straight again my mare touch bottom and there wa hope it
struggl forward be swept down the stream all the time now
the hors in the cart also found their foot and we were
save
no the wet had caus the knot of on of the riem to slip
beneath the strain or perhap it brokei dont know feel
the pull slacken the leader whip round on to the wheeler
there thei all stood in a heap their head and part of their
neck abov water while the cart float behind them on it
side kaatj scream and anscomb flog i leapt from my
mare and struggl to the leader the water up to my chin
grasp their bit i manag to keep them from turn further
but i could do no more and death came veri near to us had it
not been for some of those brave swazi on the bank it would have
found us everi on but thei plung in eight of them hold
each other hand and halfswim halfwad reach us
thei got the hors by the head and straighten them out while
anscomb pli hi whip a dash forward and the wheel were on
the bottom again
three minut later we were safe on the further bank which my
mare had alreadi reach where i lai gasp on my face
ejacul prayer of thank and spit out muddi water
chapter x
nomb
the swazi shiver for all these peopl hate cold and
shake themselv like a dog when he come to shore gather
round examin me
why said on of them an elderli man who seem to be their
leader thi is none other than macumazahn watcherbynight
the old friend of all us black peopl sure the spirit of our
father have been with us who might have risk our live to save
a boer or a halfbre the swazi i mai explain did not like
the boer for reason thei consid sound
ye i said sit up it is i macumazahn
then why ask the man did you whom all know to be wise
show yourself to have suddenli becom a fool and he point to
the rage river
and why i ask do you show yourself a fool by suppos
that i whom you know to be none am a fool look across the
water for your answer
he look and saw the basuto fifti or more of them arriv
just too late
who ar these he ask
thei ar the peopl of sekukuni whom you should know well
enough thei have hunt us all night ye and befor seek
to murder us also thei have stolen our oxen thirtytwo fine
oxen which i give to your king if he can take them back now
perhap you understand why we dare the crocodil river in it
rage
at the name of sekukuni the man who it seem wa the captain of
some border guard stiffen all over like a terrier which
perceiv a rat what he exclaim do these dirti basuto
dog dare to carri spear so near our countri have thei not yet
learn their lesson
then he rush into the water shake an assegai he had snatch
up and shout
bide a while you flea from the kaross of sekukuni till i can
come across and crack you between my thumb and finger or at the
least wait until macumazahn ha time to get hi rifl no put
down those gun of your for everi shot you fire i swear that i
will cut ten basuto throat when we come to storm your koppi
as we shall do er long
be silent i said and let me speak
then i too call across the river ask where wa that fat
captain of their as i would talk with him on of the men
shout back that he had stop behind veri sick becaus of a
ghost that he had seen
ah i answer a ghost who prick him in the throat well
i wa that ghost and such ar the thing that happen to those
who would harm macumazahn and hi friend did you not sai last
night that he is a leopard who leap out in the dark bite and
is gone again
ye the man shout back and it is true though had we
known o macumazahn that you were the ghost hide in those
stone you should never have leapt again oh that white
medicineman who is dead ha sent us on a mad errand
so you will think when i come to visit you among your koppi
go home and take a messag from macumazahn to sekukuni who
believ that the english have run awai from him tell him that
thei will return again and these swazi with them and that then
he will ceas to live and hi town will be burnt and hi tribe
will no more be a tribe awai now more swiftli than you came
sinc the water by which you thought to trap us is fall and a
swazi impi gather to make an end of everi on of you
the man attempt no answer nor did hi peopl so much as fire
on us thei turn tail and crept off like a pack of frighten
jackalspursu by the mock of the swazi
still in a wai thei had the laugh of us see that thei gave us
a terribl fright and stole our wagon and thirtytwo oxen well
a year or two later i help to pai them back for that fright and
even recov some of the oxen
when thei had gone the swazi led us to a kraal about two mile
from the river send on a runner with order to make hut and
food readi for us it wa just as much as we could do to reach
it for we were all utterli worn out as were the hors still
we did get there at last the hot sun warm us as we went
arriv at the kraal i help heda and kaatj from the cartth
former could scarc walk poor dearand into the guest hut
which seem clean where food of a sort and fur kaross were
brought to them in which to wrap themselv while their cloth
dri
leav them in charg of two old women i went to see to
anscomb who as yet could not do much for himself also to the
outspan of the hors which were put into a cattl kraal
where thei lai down at onc without attempt to eat the green
forag which wa given to them after thi i gave our good into
the charg of the kraalhead a nice old fellow whom i had never
met befor and he led anscomb to anoth hut close to that
where the women were here we drank some maa that is curdl
milk at a littl mutton though we were too fatigu to be veri
hungri and strip off our wet cloth threw them out into
the sun to dry
that wa a close shave said anscomb as he wrap up in the
kaross
veri i answer so close that i think you must have been
start in life with an extra strong guardian angel well
accustom to nativ wai
ye he repli and old fellow i believ that on earth he
goe by the name of allan quatermain
after thi i rememb no more for i went to sleep and so
remain for about twentyfour hour thi wa not wonder
see that for two dai and night practic i had not rest
dure which time i went through much fatigu and mani emot
when at length i did wake up the first thing i saw wa anscomb
alreadi dress engag in clean my cloth with a brush from
hi toilet case i rememb think how smart and incongru
that dressingbag made appropri enough of crocodil hide
look in thi kaffir hut with it silvertop bottl and it
ivoryhandl razor
time to get up sir bath readi sir he said in hi jolli
drawl voic point to a calabash full of hot water hope
you slept as well as i did sir
you appear to have recov your spirit i remark as i rose
and began to wash myself
ye sir and why not heda is quit well for i have seen her
these swazi ar veri good peopl and as kaatj understand
their languag bring us all we want our troubl seem to be
done with old marnham is dead and doubtless cremat rodd is
dead and let us hope in heaven the basuto have melt awai
the morn is fine and warm and a whole kid is cook for
breakfast
i wish there were two for i am raven i remark
the hors ar get rest and feed well though some of
their leg have fill and the trap is littl the wors for i
have walk to look at them or rather hop lean on the
shoulder of a veri sniffi swazi boi do you know old fellow i
believ there never were ani basuto also that the vener
marnham and the lurid rodd had no real exist that thei were
but illus a prolong nightmareno more here is your
shirt i am sorri that i have not had time to wash it but it
ha cook well in the sun which be flannel is almost as
good
at ani rate heda remain i remark cut hi nonsens
short and i suppos she is not a nightmar or a delus
ye thank god she remain he repli with earnest oh
allan i thought she must drown in that river and if i had lost
her i think i should have gone mad inde at the moment i
felt myself go mad while i drag and flog at those
hors
well you didnt lose her and if she had drown you would
have drown also so dont talk ani more about it she is
safe and now we have got to keep her so for you ar not marri
yet my boi and there ar gener more tree in a wood than
on can see still we ar aliv and well which is more than we
had ani right to expect and as you sai let us thank god for
that
then i put on my coat and my boot which anscomb had greas as
he had no black and crept from the hut
there onli a few yard awai engag in set the breakfast in
the shadow of anoth hut on a tan hide that serv for a
tablecloth while kaatj saw to the cook close by i found
heda still a littl pale and sorrow but otherwis quit well
and rest moreov she had manag to dress herself veri
nice i suppos by help of spare cloth in the cart and
therefor look as charm as she alwai did i think that her
perfect manner were on of her greatest attract thu on
thi morn her first thought wa to thank me veri sweetli for
all she wa good enough to sai i had done for her and anscomb
therebi as she put it save their live sever time over
my dear young ladi i answer as roughli as i could dont
flatter yourself on that point it wa my own life of which i wa
think
but she onli smile and shake her head in a fascin wai
that wa peculiar to her remark that i could not deceiv her
as i did the kaffir after thi the solid kaatj brought the
food and we breakfast veri heartili or at least i did
now i am not go to set out all the detail of our journei
through swaziland for though in some wai it wa interest
enough also as comfort as a stai among savag can be for
everywher we were kindli receiv to do so would be too long
and i must get on with my stori at the king kraal which we
did not reach for some dai as the absenc of road and the
flood state of the river also the need of spare our hors
caus us to travel veri slowli i met a boer who i think wa
concess hunt
he told me that thing were realli seriou in zululand so
seriou that he thought there wa a probabl of immedi war
between the english and the zulu he said also that cetewayo
the zulu king had sent messeng to stir up the basuto and
other tribe against the white men with the result that sekukuni
had alreadi made a raid toward pilgrim rest and lydenburg
i express surpris and ask innoc if he had done ani
harm the boer repli he understood that thei had stolen some
cattl kill two white men if not more and burnt their hous
he ad howev that he wa not sure whether the white men had
been kill by the kaffir or by other white men with whom thei
had quarrel there wa a rumour to thi effect and he
understood that the magistr of barberton had gone with some
mount polic and arm nativ to investig the matter
then we part as have got hi concess to which the king
umbandin had put hi mark when he wa drunk on brandi that the
boer himself had brought with him as a present he wa anxiou to
be gone befor he grew sober and revok it inde he wa in
so great a hurri that he never stop to inquir what i wa
do in swaziland nor do i think he realiz that i wa not
alon certainli he wa quit unawar that i had been mix up
in these basuto troubl still hi stori as to the
investig concern the death of marnham and rodd made me
uneasi sinc i fear lest he should hear someth on hi
journei and put two and two togeth though as a matter of fact
i dont think he ever did either of these thing
the swazi told me much the same stori as to the brew zulu
storm in fact an old induna or councillor whom i knew
inform me that cetewayo had sent messeng to them ask for
their help if it should come to fight with the white men but
that the king and councillor answer that thei had alwai been
the queen children which wa not strictli true as thei were
never under english rule and did not wish to bite her feet if
she should have to fight with her hand i repli that i hope
thei would alwai act up to these fine word and chang the
subject
now onc more the question aros as to whether we should make for
natal or press on to zululand the rumour of come war
suggest that the first would be our better cours while the
boer stori as to the investig of rodd death point the
other wai realli i did not know which to do and as usual
anscomb and heda seem inclin to leav the decis to me i
think that after all natal would have gain the dai had it not
been for a singular circumst not a flash of lightn thi
time inde i had almost made up my mind to risk troubl and
inquiri as to rodd death rememb that in natal these two
young peopl could get marri which be in loco parenti i
thought it desir thei should do as soon as possibl if onli
to eas me of my respons also thenc i could attend to
the matter of heda inherit and rid myself of her father
will that alreadi had been somewhat damag in the crocodil
river though not as much as it might have been sinc i had taken
the precaut to enclos it in anscomb spong bag befor we
left the hous
the circumst wa thi on emerg from the cart on morn
where i slept to keep an ey upon the valuabl for it will be
rememb that we had a consider sum in gold with us also
heda jewel a swazi inform me that a messeng wish to see
me i ask what messeng and whenc did he come he repli
that the messeng wa a witchdoctoress name nomb and that
she came from zululand and said that i knew her father
i bade the man bring her to me wonder who on earth she could
be for it is not usual for the zulu to send women as
messeng and from whom she came howev i knew exactli what
she would be like some hideou old hag smell horribl of
greas and other abomin with a worn snake skin and some
human bone ti about her
present she came escort by the swazi who wa grin for i
think he guess what i expect to see i stare and rub my
ey think that i must still be asleep for instead of a fat
old isanusi there appear a tall and grace young woman
rather lightcolour with deep and quiet ey and a by no mean
illfavour face remark for a fix and somewhat mysteri
smile she wa a witchdoctoress sure enough for she wore in
her hair the regul bladder and about her neck the circlet
of baboon teeth also round her middl a girdl from which hung
littl bag of medicin
she contempl me grave and i contempl her wait till
she should choos to speak at length have examin me inch
by inch she salut by rais her round arm and taper
hand and remark in a soft full voic
all is as the pictur told i perceiv befor me the lord
macumazahn
i thought thi a strang sai see that i could not
recollect have given my photograph to ani on in zululand
you need no magic to tell you that doctoress i remark but
where did you see my pictur
in the dust far awai she repli
and who show it to you
on who knew you o macumazahn in the year befor i came out
of the dark on name open of road and with him anoth
who also knew you in those year on who ha gone down to the
dark
now for some occult reason i shrank from ask the name of thi
on who had gone down to the dark although i wa sure that
she wa wait for the question so i mere remark without
show surpris
so zikali still live doe he he should have been dead long
ago
you know well that he live macumazahn for how could he die
till hi work wa accomplish moreov you will rememb that
he spoke to you when last moon wa but just past her fullin a
dream macumazahn i brought that dream although you did not
see me

the watcherbynight is pleas to sai that i lie so doubtless
i do lie she answer her fix smile deepen a littl
then she fold her arm across her breast and remain silent

of the cup of dream i said with sarcasm who send a messag
by your lip for me and what ar the word of the messag
my lord the spirit spoke the messag by the mouth of the
master zikali he send it on to you by the lip of your
servant the doctoress nomb

somehow i wish to postpon the hear of that messag
o macumazahn i have heard the call i have felt the pain in my
back i have drunk of the black medicin and of the white
medicin ye for a whole year i have been visit by the
multitud of spirit and seen the shade of those who live and of
those who ar dead i have dive into the river and drawn my
snake from it mud see it skin is about me now and open
the mantl she wore she show what look like the skin of a
black mamba fasten round her slender bodi i have dwelt in
the wilder alon and listen to it voic i have sat at
the feet of my master the open of road and look down the
road and drunk of hi wisdom ye i am in truth a doctoress
well after all thi you should be as wise as you ar pretti
onc befor macumazahn you told a maid of my peopl that she
wa pretti and she came to no good end though to on that wa
great therefor do not sai to me that i am pretti though i am
glad that you should think so who can compar me with so mani
whom you have known and she drop her ey look a littl
shy
it wa the first human touch i had seen about her and i wa glad
to have found a weak spot in her armour moreov from that
moment she wa alwai my friend
as you will nomb now for your messag
my lord the spirit speak through zikali as on who make
music speak through a pipe of reed sai
never mind what the spirit sai tell me what zikali sai i

him to do and as he told you nearli three hundr moon ago in
what must be done you will have your part of that he will speak
to you afterward macumazahn you dream a dream did you not
ly asleep in the hous that wa built of white stone which now
is black with fire i zikali sent you that dream through the
art of a child of mine who is name nomb she to whom i have
given a spirit to guid her feet you did well to follow it
macumazahn for had you tri the other path which would have
led you back to the town of the white men you and those with
you must have been kill how it doe not matter now by the
mouth of nomb i sai to you do not follow the thought that is in
your mind as she speak to you and go to natal sinc if you do
so you and those with you will come to much shame and troubl
that to you would be wors than death over the matter of the
kill of a certain white doctor in a swamp where grow
yellowwood tree for there in natal you will be taken all of
you and sent back to the transvaal to be tri befor a man who
wear upon hi head hors hair stain white but if you come
to zululand thi shadow shall pass awai from you sinc great
thing ar about to happen which will caus so small a matter to
be forgot moreov i zikali who do not lie promis thi
that howev great mai be their danger here in zululand those
halffledg on whom you the old nighthawk cover with your
wing shall in the end suffer no harm those of whom i spoke to

heddana who stretch out their arm on to anoth i wait to
welcom you here at the black kloof whither my daughter nomb
will guid you cetewayo the king also will welcom you and
so will anoth whose name i do not utter now choos i have

befor and appar indiffer as to it effect
how do i know that you come from zikali i ask you mai be
but the bait set upon a trap
from somewher within her robe she produc a knife and hand it
to me remark
the master sai you will rememb thi and by it know that the
messag come from him he bade me add that with it wa carv a
certain imag that onc he gave to you at panda kraal wrap
round with a woman hair which imag you still have
i look at the knife and did rememb it for it wa on of
those of swedish make with a wooden handl the first that i had
ever seen in africa i had made a present of it to zikali when i
return to zululand befor the war between the princ the
imag too i still possess it wa that of the woman call
mameena who brought about the war and the wrap which cover
it wa of the hair that onc grew upon her head
the word ar zikali i said return her the knife but
why do you call yourself the child of on who is too old to be a
father
the master sai that my greatgrandmoth wa hi daughter and
that therefor i am hi child now macumazahn i go to eat with
my peopl for i have servant with me then i must speak with
the swazi king for whom i also have a messag which i cannot do
at present becaus he is still drunk with the white man liquor
after that i shall be readi to return with you to zululand
i never said that i wa go to zululand nomb
yet your heart ha gone there alreadi macumazahn and you must
follow your heart doe not the imag which wa carv with the
knife you gave hold a white heart in it hand and although it
seem to be but a bit of umzimbeet wood is it not aliv and
bewitch which perhap is why you could never make up your mind
to burn it macumazahn
i wish i had i repli angrili but have thrown thi last
spear with a flash of her unholi ey nomb had turn and gone
a clever woman and thoroughli coach thought i well zikali
wa never on to suffer fool and doubtless she is anoth of
the pawn whom he us on hi board of polici oh she or
rather he wa right my heart wa in zululand though not in the
wai he thought and i long to see the end of that great game
plai by a wizard against a despot and hi host
so we went to zululand becaus after talk it over we all came
to the conclus that thi wa the best thing to do especi
as there we seem to be sure of a welcom for later in the dai
nomb repeat to anscomb and heda the invit which she had
deliv to me assur them also that in zululand thei would
come to no harm
it wa curiou to watch the meet between heda and nomb the
doctoress appear just as we had risen from breakfast and heda
turn round came face to face with her
is thi your witch mr quatermain she ask me in her
vivaci wai why she is differ from what i expect
quit goodlook and ye impress i am not sure that she
doe not frighten me a littl
what doe the inkosikaasi ie the chieftai sai
concern me macumazahn ask nomb
onli what i said that you ar young who she thought would be
old and pretti who she thought would be ugli
to grow old we must first be young macumazahn and in due
season all of us will becom ugli even the inkosikaasi but i
thought she said also that she fear me
do you know english nomb
nai but i know how to read ey and the inkosikaasi ha ey
that talk tell her that she ha no reason to fear me who would
be her friend though i think that she will bring me littl
luck
it wa scarc necessari so far as heda wa concern but i
translat leav out the last sentenc
sai to her that i am grate who have few friend and that i
will fear her no more said heda
again i translat whereon nomb stretch out her hand
sai
let her not scorn to take it it is clean it ha brought no
man to hi death here she look at heda meaningli
moreov though she is white and i am black i like herself am
of high blood and come of a race of warrior who did noth
small and lastli we ar of an ag and if she is beauti i
am wise and have gift great as her own
onc more i interpret for the benefit of anscomb for heda
understood zulu well enough although she had pretend not to do
so after which the two shook hand to anscomb amus and
my wonder for i felt thi scene to be strain and on that
hid or presag someth i did not comprehend
thi is the chief she love said nomb to me studi
anscomb with her steadi ey after heda had gone well he is
no common man and brave if idl on too who mai grow tall in
the world should he live when he ha learn to think but
macumazahn if she met you both at the same time why did she not
choos you
just now you said you were wise nomb i repli laugh
but now i see that like most of your trade you ar but a vain
boaster is there a hat upon my head that you cannot see the
colour of my hair and is it natur that youth should turn to
ag
sometim if the mind is old macumazahn which is why i love
the spirit onli who ar more ancient than the mountain and
with them zikali their servant who wa young befor the zulu
were a peopl or so he sai and still year by year gather
wisdom as the bee gather honei inspan your hors macumazahn
for i have done my busi and am readi to start
chapter xi
zikali
ten dai had gone by when onc more i found myself draw near
to the mouth of the black kloof where dwelt zikali the wizard
our journei in zululand had been tediou and unev it
seem to me that we met extraordinarili few peopl it wa as
though the place had suddenli becom depopul and i even
pass great kraal where there wa no on to be seen i ask
nomb what wa the mean of thi for she and three silent men
she had with her were act as our guid onc she answer
that the peopl had move becaus of lack of food as the season
had been on of great scarciti ow to drought and onc that
thei had been summon to a gather at the king kraal near
ulundi at ani rate thei were not there and the few who did
appear stare at us strang
moreov i notic that thei were not allow to speak to us
also heda wa kept in the cart and nomb insist that the rear
canva curtain should be close and a blanket fasten behind
anscomb who drove evid with the object that she should not
be seen further on the plea of weari from the time that
we enter zulu territori nomb ask to be allow to ride in
the cart with kaatj and heda her real reason as i wa sure
be that she might keep a watch on them lastli we travel
by littlefrequ track halt at night in outofthewai
place where howev we alwai found food await us
doubtless by arrang
with on man whom i had known in past dai and who recogn me
i did manag to have a short talk he ask me what i wa do
in zululand at that time i repli that i wa on a visit to
zikali whereon he said i should be safer with him than with ani
on els
our convers went no further for just then on of nomb
servant appear and made some remark to the man of which i
could not catch the mean whereon he promptli turn and
deport leav me wonder and uneasi
evid we were be isol but when i remonstr with
nomb she onli answer with her most unfathom smile

that those with you would stai behind sound asleep macumazahn
for which like you i should be sorri
after thi i said no more for i knew that she meant to warn me

took no thought be content to leav me in whom thei had a
blind faith to manag everyth moreov heda who in the
joi of her love wa begin to forget the sorrow of her
father death and the other tragic event through which she had
just pass took a great fanci to the young witchdoctoress who
convers with her in zulu a languag of which have live so
long in natal heda knew much alreadi inde when i suggest
to her that to be overtrust wa not wise she fire up and
repli that she had been accustom to nativ all her life and
could judg them ad that she had everi confid in nomb
after thi i held my tongu and said no more of my doubt what
wa the us sinc heda would not listen to them and at that time
anscomb wa noth but her echo
so thi for me veri dull journei continu till at length
after be held up for a coupl of dai by a flood river where
there wa noth to do but sit and smoke as nomb request me
not to make a nois by shoot at the big game that abound we
began to emerg from the bushveld on to the love upland in
the neighbourhood of nongoma leav these on our right we
head for a place call ceza a natur stronghold consist
of a flat plain on the top of a mountain which plain is
surround by bush it is at the foot of thi stronghold that
the black kloof li be on of the ravin that run up into
the mountain
so thither we came at last it wa draw toward sunset a
tremend and stormi sunset as we approach the place and lo
it look exactli as it had done when first i saw it more than a
score of year befor forbid as the mouth of hell vast and
lonesom there stood the column of boulder fantast
pile on upon anoth there grew the spars tree upon it
steep side mingl with alo that look like the shape of
men there wa the granit bottom swept almost clean by flood in
some dim ag and the littl stream that flow along it there
too wa the spot where onc i had outspan my wagon on the
night when my servant swore that thei saw the imikovu or
wizardrais spectr float past them on the air in the
shape of the princ and other who were soon to fall at the
battl of the tugela up it we went i ride and nomb who had
descend from the cart that follow walk by my side and
watch me
you seem sad macumazahn she said at length
ye nomb i am sad thi place make me so
is it the place macumazahn or is it the thought of on whom
onc you met in the place on who is dead
i look at her pretend not to understand and she went on
i have the gift of vision macumazahn which come at time to
those of my trade and now and again amongst other i have
seem to see the spirit of a certain woman haunt thi kloof
as though she were wait for some on
inde and what mai that woman be like i inquir carelessli
as it chanc i can see her now glide backward in front of you
just there and therefor am abl to answer your question
macumazahn she is tall and slender beautifulli made and
lightcolour for on of us black peopl she ha larg ey
like a buck and those ey ar full of fire that doe not come
from the sun but from within her face is tender yet proud oh
so proud that she make me afraid she wear a cloak of grei
fur and about her neck there is a circlet of big blue bead with
which her finger plai a thought come from her to me these
ar the word of the thought i have wait long in thi dark
place watch by dai and night till you the watcherbynight

shield upon your arm and a spear in your hand such ar the
word of her thought macumazahn but she ha gone awai and i
hear no more it wa as though your hors rode over her and she
pass through you
then like on who wish to answer no question nomb turn
and went back to the cart where she began to talk indiffer
with heda for as soon as we enter the kloof her servant had
drawn back the curtain and let fall the blanket as for me i
groan for of cours i knew that zikali who wa well
acquaint with the appear of mameena had instruct nomb
to sai all thi to me in order to impress my mind for some reason
of hi own yet he had done it cleverli for such word as those
mameena might well have utter could her great spirit have need
to walk the earth again wa such a thing possibl i wonder
no it wa not possibl yet it wa true that her atmospher
seem to cling about thi place and that my imagin excit
by memori and nomb suggest seem to apprehend her
presenc
as i reflect the hors advanc round the littl bend in the
evernarrow cliff and there in front of me under the
gigant mass of overhang rock appear the kraal of zikali
surround by it reed fenc the gate of the fenc wa open and
beyond it on hi stool in front of the larg hut sat zikali
even at that distanc it wa imposs to mistak hi figur
which wa like no other that i had known in the world a
broadshould dwarf with a huge head deep sunken ey and
snowi hair that hung upon hi shoulder the whole frame and face
pervad with an air of great antiqu and yet ow to the
plump of the flesh and that fresh of skin which is
sometim seen in the ag compar younglook
such wa the great wizard zikali known throughout the land for
longer than ani live man could rememb as open of road a
titl that refer to hi power of spiritu vision also as
the thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn a name given to him
by chaka the first and greatest of the zulu king becaus of
hi deform
there he sat silent impass stare openei at the red ball
of the set sun look more like some unshap statu than
a man hi silent fiercefac servant appear to me thei
look like the same men whom i had seen here three and twenti
year befor onli grown older inde i think thei were for
thei greet me by name and salut by rais their broad
spear i dismount and wait while anscomb whose foot wa
now quit well again help heda from the cart which wa led
awai by the servant anscomb who seem a littl oppress
remark that thi wa a strang place
ye said heda but it is magnific i like it
then her ey fell upon zikali seat befor the hut and she
turn pale
oh what a terriblelook man she murmur if he is a
man
the maid kaatj saw him also and utter a littl cry
dont be frighten dear said anscomb he is onli an old
dwarf
i suppos so she exclaim doubtfulli but to me he is like
the devil
nomb slid past us she threw off the kaross she wore and for
the first time appear nake except for the mucha about her
middl and her ornament down she went on her hand and knee
and in thi humbl postur crept toward zikali arriv in
front of him she touch the ground with her forehead then
lift her right arm gave the salut of makosi to which as a
great wizard he wa entitl be suppos to be the home of
mani spirit so far as i could see he took no notic of her
present she move and squat herself down on hi right hand
while two of hi attend appear from behind the hut and took
their stand between him and it doorwai hold their spear
rais about a minut later nomb beckon to us to approach
and we went forward across the courtyard i a littl ahead of the
other as we drew near zikali open hi mouth and utter a
loud and terrifi laugh how well i rememb that laugh
which i had first heard at dingaan kraal as a boi after the
murder of retief and the boer
see the book call mari by h rider haggard
i begin to think that you ar right and that thi old gentleman
must be the devil said anscomb to heda then laps into
silenc
as i wa determin not to speak first i took the opportun to
fill my pipe zikali who wa watch me although all the
while he seem to be stare at the set sun made a sign
on of the servant dash awai and immedi return bear
a flame brand which he proffer to me as a pipelight then he
depart again to bring three carv stool of red wood which he
place for us i look at mine and knew it again by the
carv it wa the same on which i had sat when first i met
zikali at length he spoke in hi deep slow voic
mani year have gone by macumazahn sinc you made us of that
stool thei ar cut in notch upon the leg you hold and you mai
count them if you will
i examin the leg there were the notch twentytwo or three
of them on the other leg were more notch too numer to
reckon
do not look at those macumazahn for thei have noth to do
with you thei tell the year sinc the first of the hous of
senzangacona sat upon that stool sinc chaka sat upon it sinc
dingaan and other sat upon it on mameena among them well
much ha happen sinc it serv you for a rest you have
wander far and seen strang thing and live where other would
have di becaus it wa your lot to live of all of which we
will talk afterward and now when you ar grei you have come
back here as the open of road told you you would do bring
with you new companion you who have the art of make friend
even when you ar old which is on given to few men where ar
those with whom you us to compani macumazahn where ar
saduko and mameena and the rest all gone except the
thingwhoshouldneverhavebeenborn and again he laugh
loudli
and who it seem ha never learn when to die i remark
speak for the first time
just so macumazahn becaus i cannot die until my work is
finish but thank be to the spirit of my father and to my
own that i live on to glut with vengeanc the end draw near at
last and as i promis you in the dead dai you shall have your
share in it macumazahn
he paus then continu still stare at the sink sun
which made hi remark about us whom he did not seem to see
uncanni
that white man with you is brave and wellborn on who love
fight i think and the maiden is fair and sweet with a high
spirit she is think to herself that i am an old wizard whom
if she were not afraid of me she would ask to tell her her
fortun see she understand and start well perhap i will
on dai meanwhil here is a littl bit of it she will have
five children of whom two will die and on will give her so much
troubl that she will wish it had di also but who their
father will be i do not sai nomb my child lead awai thi
white on and her woman to the hut that ha been made readi for
her for she is weari and would rest see too that she lack
for noth which we can give her who is our guest let the
white lord mauriti accompani her to the hut and be shown that
next to it in which he and macumazahn will sleep so that he mai
be sure that she is safe and attend to the hors if he will
there is a place to tether them behind the hut and the men who
travel with you will help him afterward when i have spoken
with him macumazahn can join them that thei mai eat befor thei
sleep
these direct i translat to anscomb who went gladli enough
with heda for i think thei were both afraid of the terribl old
dwarf and did not desir hi compani in the gather gloom
the sun sink onc more macumazahn he said when thei were
gone and the air grow chill come with me now into my hut
where the fire burn for i am ag and the cold strike through
me also there we can be alon
so speak he turn and crawl into the hut look like a
gigant whitehead beetl as he did so a creatur i
rememb to which i had onc compar him in the past i
follow carri the histor stool and when he had seat
himself on hi kaross on the further side of the fire took up my
posit opposit to him thi fire wa fed with some kind of
root or wood that gave a thin clear flame with littl or no
smoke over it he crouch so close that hi great head
seem to be almost in the flame at which he stare with
unblink ey as he had done at the sun circumst which
ad to hi terrifi appear and made me think of a certain
region and it inhabit
why do you come here macumazahn he ask after studi me
for a while through that window of fire
becaus you brought me zikali partli through your messeng
nomb and partli by mean of a dream which she sai you sent
did i macumazahn if so i have forgotten it dream ar as
mani as gnat by the water thei bite us while we sleep but when
we wake up we forget them also it is foolish to sai that
on man can send a dream to anoth
then your messeng li zikali especi as she ad that
she brought it
of cours she li macumazahn is she not my pupil whom i have
train from a child moreov she li well it would seem
who guess what sort of a dream you would have when you thought
of turn your step to zululand
why do you plai at stick ie fenc with me zikali see
that neither of us ar children
o macumazahn that is where you ar mistaken see that both
of us old though we be and cun though we think ourselv
ar noth but babe in the arm of fate well well i will
tell you the truth sinc it would be foolish to try to throw
dust into such ey as your i knew that you were down in
sekukuni countri and i wa watch youthrough my spi you
have been nowher dure all these year that i wa not watch
youthrough my spi for instanc that arablook man name
harut whom first you met at a big kraal in a far countri wa a
spy of mine he ha visit me late and told me much of your
do no dont ask me of him now who would talk to you of
other matter
doe harut still live then and ha he found a new god in place
of the ivori child i interrupt
macumazahn if he did not live how could he visit and speak
with me well i watch you there by the oliph river where
you fought sekukuni peopl and afterward in the marbl hut
where you found the old white man dead in hi chair and got the
write that you have in your pocket which concern the maiden
heddana also afterward when the white man your friend kill
the doctor who fell into a mud hole and the basuto stole hi
cattl and wagon
how do you know all these thing zikali
have i not told youthrough my spi wa there not a
halfbre driver call footsack and do not the basuto come
and go between the black kloof and sekukuni town bear me
tide
ye zikali and so doe the wind and so do the bird
true o macumazahn i see that you ar on who ha watch
natur and it wai as close as my spi watch you so i
learn these matter and knew that you were in troubl over the
death of these white men and your friend likewis and as you
were alwai dear to me i sent that child nomb to bring you to
me think from what i knew of you that you would be more
like to follow a woman who is both wise and good to look at
than a man who might be neither i told her to sai to you that
you and the other would be safer here than in natal at present
it seem that you hearken and came that is all
ye i hearken and came but zikali that is not all for
you know well that you sent for me for your own sake not for
mine
o macumazahn who can prevent a needl from pierc cloth when
it is push by a finger like your your wit ar too sharp for
me macumazahn your ey read through the blanket of cun
with which i would hide my thought you speak truli i did send
for you for my own sake as well as for your i sent for you
becaus i want your counsel macumazahn and becaus cetewayo
the king also want your counsel and i wish to see you befor
you saw cetewayo now you have the whole truth
what do you want my counsel about zikali
he lean forward till hi white lock almost seem to mingl
with the thin flame through which he glare at me with ey that
were fiercer than the fire
macumazahn you rememb the stori that i told you long ago do
you not
veri well zikali it wa that you hate the hous of
senzangacona which ha given all it king to zululand first
becaus you ar on of the dwandw tribe whom the zulu crush
and mock at secondli becaus chaka the lion name you the
thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn and kill your wive
for which crime you brought about the death of chaka thirdli
becaus you have match your singl wit for mani year against
all the power of the royal hous and yet kept your life in you
notabl when panda threaten you in my presenc at the trial of
on who ha gone down and you told him to kill you if he
dare now you would prove that you were right by caus your
cun to triumph over the royal hous
true quit true o macumazahn you have a good memori
macumazahn especi for anyth that ha to do with that
woman who ha gone down i sent her down but how wa she
name macumazahn i forget i forget whose mind be old
fall suddenli into black pit of darknesslik her who went
down
he paus and we stare at each other through the veil of fire
then as i made no answer he went on
oh i rememb now she wa call mameena wa she not a name
taken from the wail of the wind hark it is wail now
i listen it wa and i shiver to hear it sinc but a minut
befor the night had been quit still ye the wind moan and
wail about the rock of the black kloof
well enough of her why troubl about the dead when there ar
so mani to be sent to join them macumazahn the hour is at
hand the fool cetewayo ha quarrel with your peopl the
english and on my counsel he ha sent and kill women or
allow other to do so across the river in natal hi
messeng came to me ask what he should do i answer
shall a king of the blood of chaka fear to allow hi own wick
on to be slain becaus thei have step across a strip of
water and still call himself king of the zulu so those women
were drag back across the water and kill and now the
queen man from the cape ask mani thing great fine of
cattl the give up of the slayer and that an end should be
made of the zulu armi which is to lai down it spear and set to
hoe like the old women in the kraal
and if the king refus what then zikali
then macumazahn the queen man will declar war on the zulu
alreadi he gather hi soldier for the war
will cetewayo refus zikali
i do not know hi mind swing thi wai and that like a pole
balanc on a rock the end of the pole ar weight with much
counsel and it hang so even that if a grasshopp lit on on
end or the other it would turn the scale
and do you wish me to be that grasshopp zikali
who els that is why i brought you to zululand
so you wish me to counsel cetewayo to lie down in the bed that
the english have made for him if he seek my advic i will do
so gladli for so i am sure he will sleep well
why do you mock me macumazahn i wish you to counsel cetewayo
to throw back hi word into the teeth of the queen man and to
fight the english
and thu bring destruct on the zulu and death to thousand
of them and of my own peopl and in return gain noth but
remors do you think me mad or wick or both that i should
do thi thing
nai macumazahn you would gain much i could show you where
the king cattl ar hidden the english will never find them
and after the war you might take as mani as you chose but it
would be useless for know you well i am sure that you would
onli hand them over to the british govern as onc you hand
over the cattl of bangu be fashion that wai by the
greatgreat macumazahn
perhap i might but then what should i gain zikali
thi you would so bring thing about that be broken by war
the zulu power could never again menac the white men which
would be a great and good deed macumazahn
mayhapi am not sure but of thi i am sure that i will not
thrust my face into your nest of wasp that the english hornet
mai steal the honei when thei ar disturb i leav such
matter to the queen and those who rule under her so have done
with such talk for you do but wast your breath zikali
it is as i guess it would be he answer shake hi great
head you ar too honest to prosper in the world macumazahn
well i must find other mean to bring the hous of cetewayo to
the end that he deserv who ha been an evil and a cruel king
all thi he said show neither surpris nor resent which
convinc me of what i had suspect throughout that never for
an instant did he believ that i should fall in with hi
suggest and try to influenc the zulu to declar war no
thi talk of hi wa but a blind there wa some deeper scheme at
work in hi cun old brain which he wa hide from me why
exactli had he beguil me to zululand i could not divin and
to ask him would be wors than useless but then and there i made
up my mind that i would get awai from the black kloof earli on
the follow morn if that were possibl
he began to speak of other matter in a low drone voic like
a man who convers with himself sad all of them such as the
haunt death of saduko who had betrai hi lord the princ
umbelazi becaus of a woman everi circumst of which seem
to be familiar to him
i made no answer who wa wait for an opportun to leav the
hut and did not care to dwell on these event he ceas and
brood for a while then said suddenli
you ar hungri and would eat macumazahn and i who eat littl
would sleep for in sleep the multitud of spirit visit me
bring tide from afar well we have spoken togeth and of
that i am glad for who know when the chanc will come again
though i think that soon we shall meet at ulundi ulundi where
fate spread it net what wa it i had to sai to you ah i
rememb there is on who is alwai in your thought and whom
you wish to see on too who wish to see you you shall you
shall in payment for the troubl you have taken in come so far
to visit a poor old zulu doctor whom as you told me long ago
you know to be noth but a cheat
he paus and why i could not tell i grew weak with fear of i
knew not what and bethought me of flight
it is cold in thi hut is it not he went on burn up fire
burn up and plung hi hand into a catskin bag of medicin
which he wore he drew out some powder which he threw upon the
ember that instantli burst into bright flame
look now macumazahn he said look to your right
i look and oh heaven there befor me with outstretch arm
and infinit yearn on her face stood mameena mameena as i
had last seen her after i gave her the promis kiss that she
us to cover her take of the poison for five second
mayhap she stood thu live wonder but still as death
the fierc light show all then the flame di down again and
she wa gone
i turn and next instant wa out of the hut pursu by the
terribl laughter of zikali
chapter xii
trap
outsid in the cool night air i recov myself suffici at
ani rate to be abl to think and saw at onc that the thing wa
an illus for which zikali had prepar my mind veri carefulli
by mean of the young witchdoctoress nomb he knew well
enough that thi remark woman mameena had made a deep
impress on me nearli a quarter of a centuri befor as she had
done upon other men with whom she had been associ therefor
it wa probabl that she would alwai be present to my thought
sinc whatev a man forget he rememb the women who have
shown him favour true or fals for natur ha decre it thu
moreov thi wa on to be rememb for herself sinc she
wa beauti and most attract in her wild wai also she had
brought about a great war caus the death of thousand and
lastli her end might fairli be call majest all these
impress zikali had instruct nomb to revivifi by her
continu allus to mameena and lastli by her pretenc that
she saw her walk in front of me then when i wa tire and
hungri in that place which for me wa so close connect with
thi woman and in hi own uncanni compani either by mesmer
or through the action of the drug he threw upon the fire he had
succeed in call up the illus of her presenc to my
charm sight all thi wa clear enough what remain obscur
wa hi object
possibl he had none beyond an impish desir to frighten me
which is common enough among practition of magic in all land
well for a littl while he had succeed although to speak
truth i remain uncertain whether in a sens i wa not more
thrill and rejoic than frighten mameena had never been so
ill to look upon and i knew that dead or live i had noth to
fear from her who would have walk through hell fire for my
sake would have done anyth except perhap sacrific her
ambit no even if thi were her ghost i should have been
glad to see her again
but it wa not a ghost it wa onli a fanci reproduc exactli as
my mind had photograph her almost as my ey last saw her
when her kiss wa still warm upon my lip
such were my thought as i stood outsid that hut with the cold
perspir run down my face for to tell the truth my
nerv were upset although without reason so upset were thei
that when suddenli a silentfoot man appear out of the
dark i jump as high as though i had set my foot on a
puffadd and until i recogn him by hi voic as on of
nomb servant who had accompani us from swaziland felt
quit alarm as a matter of fact he had onli come to tell me
that our meal wa readi and that the other high white on were
wait for me
he led me round the fenc that encircl zikali dwellingplac
to two hut that stood nearli behind it almost against the face
of the rock which overhang in a curv form a kind of
natur roof abov them i thought thei must have been built
sinc i visit the place as i who have a good memori for such
thing did not rememb them inde on subsequ examin
i found that thei were quit new for the pole that form their
upright were still green and the grass of the thatch wa
scarc dry it look to me as if thei had been special
construct for our accommod
in on of these hut that to the right which wa allot to
anscomb and myself i found the other wait for me also the
food it wa good of it sort and well cook and we at it by
the light of some candl that we had with us kaatj serv us
yet although a littl while befor i had been desper
hungri now my appetit seem to have left me and i made but a
poor meal heda and anscomb also seem oppress and at
sparingli we did not talk much until kaatj had taken awai the
tin plate and gone to eat her own supper by a fire that burn
outsid the hut then heda broke out sai that she wa
terrifi of thi place and especi of it master the old
dwarf and felt sure that someth terribl wa go to happen
to her anscomb did hi best to calm her and i also told her
she had noth to fear
if there is noth to fear mr quatermain she answer
turn on me why do you look so frighten yourself by your
face you might have seen a ghost
thi sudden and singularli accur thrust for after all i had
seen someth that look veri like a ghost startl me and
befor i could invent ani sooth and appropri fib nomb
appear sai that she had come to lead heda to her
sleepingplac after thi further convers wa imposs
sinc although nomb knew but few word of english she wa a
great thoughtread and i fear to speak of anyth secret in
her presenc so we all went out of the hut nomb and i draw
back a littl to the fire while the lover said goodnight to
each other
nomb i said the inkosikazi heddana is afraid the rock of
thi kloof lie heavi on her heart the face of the open of
road is fear to her and hi laughter grate upon her ear
do you understand
i understand macumazahn and it is as i expect when you
yourself ar frighten it is natur that she an untri
maiden should be frighten also in thi home of spirit
it is men we fear not spirit now when all zululand is boil
like a pot i repli angrili
have it as you will macumazahn she said and at that moment
her quiet search ey and fix smile were hate to me
at least you admit that you do fear well for the ladi heddana
fear noth i sleep across the door of her hut and while i
who have learn to love her live i sayfor her fear noth
whatev mai chanc or whatev you mai see or hear
i believ you but nomb you might die
ye i mai die but be sure of thi that when i die she will be
safe and he who love her also sleep well macumazahn and do
not dream too much of what you heard and saw in zikali hous
then befor i could speak she turn and left me
i did not sleep well i slept veri badli to begin with
mauric anscomb gener the most cheer and nonchal of
mortal with a jest for everi woe wa in a most depress
condit and inform me of it sever time while i wa
get readi to turn in he said he thought the place hate
and felt as if peopl he could not see were look at him i had
the same sensat but did not mention the fact to him when i
told him he wa talk stuff he onli repli that he could not
help it and point out that it wa not hi gener habit to be
downcast in ani danger which wa quit true now he ad he
wa enjoi much the same sensat as he did when first he saw
the yellowwood swamp and got the idea into hi head that he
would kill some on there which happen in due cours
do you mean that you think you ar go to kill somebodi els
i ask anxious
no he answer i think i am go to be kill or someth
like it probabl by that accurs old villain of a witchdoctor
who i dont believ is altogeth human
other have thought that befor now anscomb and to be plain
i dont know that he is he live too much with the dead to be
like other peopl
and with satan to whom i expect he make sacrific the truth
is im afraid of hi plai some of hi trick with heda it is

afterward the rest of hi life wa a compound of temptat
anxieti famili troubl remors hard labour with primit
instrument and a flame sword behind him if you had left
your ev alon you would have escap all thi but you see you
didnt and as a matter of fact nobodi ever doe who is worth
hi salt for natur ha arrang it so
you appear to talk with experi allan he retort blandli
by the wai that girl nomb when she isnt stargaz or
mutter incant is alwai try to explain to heda some
tale about you and a ladi call mameena i gather that you were
introduc to her in thi neighbourhood where nomb sai you
were in the habit of kiss her in public which sound an odd
kind of a thing to do all of which happen befor she nomb
wa born she add accord to kaatj interpret that
you met her again thi afternoon which as i understand the
young woman ha been long dead seem so incomprehens that i
wish you would explain
with refer to heda i said ignor the rest as unworthi
of notic i think you mai make your mind easi zikali know
that she is in my charg and i dont believ that he want to
quarrel with me still as you ar uncomfort here the best
thing to do will be to get awai as earli as possibl tomorrow
morn where to we can decid afterward and now i am go
to sleep so pleas stop argu
as i have alreadi hint my attempt in the sleep line prove a
failur for whenev i did drop off i wa pursu by bad dream
which result from ly down so soon after supper i heard the
cri of desper men in their mortal agoni i saw a
rainswollen river it water were red with blood i beheld a
vision of on who i knew by hi dress to be a zulu king although
i could not see hi face he wa fly and stagger with
weari as he fled a great hound follow him it lift it
head from the spoor it wa that of zikali set upon the hound
bodi zikali who laugh instead of bai then on whose
copper ornament tinkl as she walk enter besid me
whisper into my ear a quarter of a hundr year have gone
by sinc we talk togeth in thi haunt kloof she seem to
whisper and befor we talk again face to face there remain to
pass of year
here she ceas though natur i should have like to hear the
number but that is just where dream break down thei tell us
onli of what we know or can evolv therefrom of what it is
imposs for us to know thei tell us nothingat least as a
gener rule
i woke up with a start and feel stifl in that hot place and
aggrav by the sound of anscomb peac breath threw a
coat about me and remov the doorboard crept into the air
the night wa still the star shone and at a littl distanc
the ember of the fire still glow by it wa seat a figur
wrap in a kaross the end of a piec of wood that the fire
had eaten through fell on to the red ash and flame up
brightli by it light i saw that the figur wa nomb the
etern smile wa still upon her face the smile which suggest
a knowledg of hidden thing that from moment to moment amus
her soul her lip move as though she were talk to an
invis companion and from time to time like on who act
upon direct she took a pinch of ash and blew them either
toward heda hut or our ye she did thi when all decent
young women should have been asleep like on who keep some
unholi midnight assign
talk with her master zikali or try to cast spell upon
us confound her thought i to myself and veri silent crept
back into the hut afterward it occur to me that she might
have had anoth motiv name of watch to see that none of
us left the hut
the rest of the night went by somehow onc listen with all
my ear i thought that i caught the sound of a number of men
tramp and of some low word of command but as i heard no more
conclud that fanci had deceiv me there i lai puzzl over
the situat till my head ach and wonder how we were to
get clear of the black kloof and zikali and out of zululand
which i gather wa no place for white peopl at the moment
it seem to me that the onli thing wa to make start for dunde
on the natal border and for the rest to trust to fortun if we
got into troubl over the death of rodd unpleas as thi would
be the matter must be face out that wa all for even if ani
wit appear against us the man had been kill in
selfdef whilst try to bring about our death at the hand
of basuto i could see now that i wa foolish not to have taken
thi line from the first but as i think i have alreadi
explain what weigh with me wa the terror of involv these
young peopl in a scandal which might shadow all their futur
live also some fate inch by inch had drag me into zululand
fortun in life there ar few mistak and even wors than
mistak that cannot be repair if the wish toward repar
is real and earnest were it otherwis not mani of us would
escap destruct in on form or anoth
thu i reflect until at length light flow faintli through
the smokehol of the hut told me that dawn wa at hand see
it i rose quietli for i did not wish to wake anscomb dress
and left the hut my object wa to find nomb who i hope would
be still sit by the fire and send her to zikali with a
messag that i wish to speak with him at onc glanc round
me in the grei dawn i saw that she wa gone and that as yet no
on seem to be stir hear a hors snort at a littl
distanc i made my wai toward the sound and in a littl bai of
the overhang cliff discov the cart and near by our beast
ti up with a plenti suppli of forag sinc so far as i
could judg in that uncertain light noth seem to be wrong
with them except weari for three of them were still ly
down i walk on to the gate of the fenc which surround
zikali big hut propos to wait there until some on appear
by whom i could send my messag
i reach the gate which i tri and found to be fasten on it
inner side then i sat down lit my pipe and wait it wa
extraordinarili lonesom in that place at least thi wa the
feel that came over me no doubt the sun wa up behind the
ceza stronghold that i have mention which tower high behind
me for the sky abov grew light with the red rai of it rise
but all the vast black kloof with it huge fantast rock wa
still plung in gloom whereof the shadow seem to oppress my
heart weari as i wa with my wake night and mani anxieti
i wa horribl nervou also and as it prove not without
reason present i heard rustl on the further side of the
fenc as of peopl creep about cautious and the sound of
whisper then of a sudden the gate wa thrown open and
through it emerg about a dozen zulu warrior all of them
ring men who instantli surround me seat there upon the
ground
i look at them and thei look at me for quit a long while
sinc follow my usual rule i determin not to be the first
to speak moreov if thei meant to kill me there wa no us in
speak at length their leader an elderli man with thin leg
a larg stomach and a rather pleasant counten salut
polit sai

true but it didnt matter for if a lie in the word of the
schoolgirl definit is an abomin to the lord it is a
veri present help in time of troubl after we have eaten i
and my friend will accompani you to the king kraal at ulundi
not so macumazahn the king said noth about your friend
of whom i do not think he ha ever heard ani more than we have

them in thi determin
the grei on ar warmer macumazahn and do not show dirt so
much answer goza thoughtfulli
good i will rememb when i have the chanc
the promis of macumazahn is known from of old to be as a tree
that eleph cannot pull down and white ant will not eat
said the sententi goza therebi intim hi belief that
some time or other thei would receiv those blanket as a
matter of fact the survivor of the parti and the famili of the
other did receiv them after the war for in deal with
nativ i have alwai made a point of try to fulfil ani
promis or engag made for valu receiv

collect what belong to me and bid farewel to my host zikali
of meat we have plenti with us macumazahn and therefor you

your shall be brought after you sinc were you mount on that
swift beast and mind to escap how could we catch you with our
feet and did you pleas to shoot us with your rifl how could
we who have onli spear save ourselv from dy as for the
open of road hi servant have told us that he mean to sleep
all todai that he mai talk with spirit in hi dream and
therefor it is useless for you to wait to bid him farewel
moreov the order of the king ar that we should bring you to
him at onc
after thi for a time there wa silenc while i sat immov
revolv the situat and the zulu regard me with a
benign interest goza took hi snuffbox from hi ear shook

in vain inhal it himself
the order of the king ar sneez that we should bring you to

you will macumazahn perhap you mai prefer to go to ulundi
dead which wouldah how strong is thi snuff it make me weep
like a womansav you the troubl of walk but if you prefer
that we should carri you be so good macumazahn first to write
the word which will caus the grei blanket to be deliv to

bottom of it i am be carri off to cetewayo at ulundi by a
parti of arm zulu who will not allow me to commun with
you probabl by zikali order you must do the best you can
for heda and yourself escap to natal if you ar abl of
cours i will help if i get the chanc but if war is about to
break out cetewayo mai kill me i think that you can trust
nomb also that zikali doe not wish to work you ani ill unless
he is oblig though i have no doubt that he ha trap us here
for some dark purpos of hi own tell him through nomb that if
harm come to you i will kill him if i live and that if i die i
will settl the score with him afterward god save and bless
you both keep up your courag and us your wit
your friend
a q
i tore out the sheet fold address it and present it to
goza remark that although it seem to be but paper it
realli wa fourteen blanketsif given at onc to nomb
he nod and hand it to on of hi men who depart in the
direct of our hut so thought i to myself nomb know all
about thi busi which mean that it is be work by
zikali that is why she spoke to me as she did last night
it is time to start macumazahn and i think you told us that
you would prefer to do so on your feet said goza look
suggest at hi spear
i am readi i said rise becaus i must for a moment i
contempl the door in the kraal fenc wonder whether it
would be safe to bolt through it and take refug with zikali
no it wa not safe sinc zikali sat there in hi hut pull
the string and probabl might refus to see me moreov it
wa like enough that befor i could find him on of those broad
spear would find my heart there wa noth to be done except
submit still i did call out in a loud voic
farewel zikali i leav you without a present against my will
who am be taken by soldier to visit the king at ulundi when
we meet again i will talk all thi matter over with you
there wa no answer and as goza took the opportun to sai that
he dislik the nois of shout extrem which sometim made
him do thing that he afterward regret i becam silent
then we depart i in the exact centr of that guard of zulu
heavyheart and fill with fear both for myself and those i
left behind me
down the black kloof we tramp emerg on the sunlit plain
beyond without meet ani on a coupl of mile further on we
came to a small stream where goza announc we would halt to eat
so we at of cold toast meat which on of the men produc from
a basket he carri unpalat food but better than noth
just as we had finish i look up and saw the soldier to whom
my note had been given he wa lead my mare that had been
saddl on it were my larg saddlebag pack with my
belong also my thick overcoat mackintosh waterbottl and
other articl down to a bag of tobacco a spare pipe and a box
of wax match moreov the man carri my doublebarrel
express rifl and a shotgun that could be us for ball
togeth with two bag of cartridg practic noth
belong to me had been forgotten
i ask him who had collect the thing he repli the
doctress nomb had done so and had brought him the hors saddl
to carri them he did not know who saddl the hors as he had
seen no on but nomb to whom he had given the write which she
hid awai in answer to further question he said that nomb had
sent me a messag it wa
i bid farewel to macumazahn for a littl while and wish him
good fortun till we meet again let him not be afraid in the
battl for even if he is hurt it will not be to death sinc
those go with him whom he cannot see and protect him with their
shield sai to macumazahn that i nomb rememb in the
morn what i said in the night and that what seem to be quit
lost is ofttim found again wish him good fortun and tell him
i am sorri that i had not time to caus hi spare garment to be
cleans with water but that i have been care to find hi
littl box with the white man medicin
i could extract noth more from thi soldier who wa either
veri stupid or chose to appear so nor inde did i dare to put
direct question about the cart and those who travel in it
soon we march again for goza would not allow me to ride the
hors fear that i should escap on it nor would he let me
carri either of the gun lest i should make us of them all dai
we travel reach the nongoma height in the late afternoon
on thi beauti spot we found a kraal situat where afterward
a magistraci wa built when we conquer the countri whenc
there is on of the finest view in zululand there wa no on
in the kraal except two old women who appear to be deaf and
dumb for all i could get out of them these ag dame howev
or other who were hidden had made readi for our arriv sinc
a calf lai skin and prepar for cook and by it big gourd
fill with kaffir beer and maa or curdl milk
in due cours we at of these provis and after we had
finish i gave goza a stiff tot of brandi of which nomb or
perhap anscomb had thoughtfulli sent a bottl with my other
baggag the strong liquor made the old fellow talk and
enabl me to get a good deal of inform out of him thu i
learn that certain demand as to which he wa rather vagu
had been made upon cetewayo by the english govern and that
the king wa now consid whether he should acced to them or
fight the great council of the nation wa summon to attend at
ulundi within a few dai when the matter would be decid
meanwhil all the regiment were be gather or as we should
sai mobil an armi said goza greater than ani that chaka
had ever led
i ask him what i had to do with thi busi that i a
peac travel and an old friend of the zulu should be made
prison and drag off to ulundi he repli he did not know
who wa not in the council of the high on but he thought that
cetewayo the king wish to see me becaus i wa their friend
perhap that he might send me as a messeng to the white peopl
i ask him how the king knew that i wa in the countri to which
he repli that zikali had told him i wa come he did not know
how whereon he goza wa sent at onc to fetch me i could get
no more out of him
i wonder if it would be worth while to make him quit drunk and
then attempt to escap on the hors but gave up the idea to
begin with hi men were at hand and there wa not enough brandi
to make them all drunk also even if i succeed in win awai
here in the heart of zululand it would not help anscomb or heda
and i should probabl be cut off and kill befor i could get
out of the countri so i abandon the plan and went to sleep
instead
next morn we left nongoma earli in the hope of reach ulundi
that even if the ivuna and black umfolozi river prove
fordabl as it chanc although thei were high we were abl
to cross them i seat on the hors which two of the zulu led
next we tramp for mile through the terribl bekameezi vallei
a hot and desol place which the zulu swear is haunt so
unhealthi is thi vallei which is the home of larg game that
whole kraal full of peopl who have tri to cultiv the rich
land have di in it of fever or fled awai leav their crop
unreap now no man dwell there after thi we climb a
terribl mount to the high land of mahlabatini and have eaten
push on onc more
at length we sight the great hillencircl plain of ulundi
which mai be call the cradl of the zulu race as polit
speak it wa destin to be it coffin on the ridg to the
west onc stood the nobamba kraal where dwelt senzangacona the
father of chaka the lion nearer to the white umfolozi wa
panda dwellingplac nodwengu which onc i knew so well
while on the slope of the hill of the northeast stood the town
of ulundi in which cetewayo dwelt bath in the light of
sunset
inde it and all the vast plain were red as though with blood
red as thei were destin to be on the come dai of the last
battl of the zulu
chapter xiii
cetewayo
it wa dark when at last we reach the ulundi kraal for the
grow moon wa obscur by cloud therefor i could see
noth and wa onli awar by the sound of voic and the
continu challeng that we were pass through great number
of men at length we were admit at the eastern gate and i wa
taken to a hut where i at onc flung myself down to sleep be
so weari that i could not attempt to eat next morn as i wa
finish my breakfast in the littl fenc courtyard of thi
guesthut goza appear and said that the king command me to
be brought to him at onc ad that i must speak softli to
him as he wa veri angri
so off we went across the great cattl kraal where a regiment of
young men two thousand strong or so were drill with a fierc
intens which show thei knew that thei were out for more than
exercis about the side of the kraal also stood hundr of
soldier all of them talk and it seem to me excit for
thei stamp upon the ground and even jump into the air to give
point to their argument suddenli some of them caught sight of
me whereon a tall trucul fellow call out
what doe a white man at ulundi at such a time when even john
dunn dare not come let us kill him and send hi head as a
present to the english gener across the tugela that will
settl thi long talk about peac or war
other of a like mind echo thi kind propos with the result
that present a score or so of them made a rush at me
brandish their stick sinc thei might not carri arm in the
royal kraal goza did hi best to keep them off but wa swept
asid like a feather or rather knock over for i saw him on
hi back with hi thin leg in the air
you must climb out of thi pit by yourself he began
address me in hi pompou and figur wai then somebodi
stamp on hi face and fix hi teeth in hi assail
heel he grew silent for a while
the trucul blackguard who wa about six feet three high and
had a mouth like a wolf throat arriv in front of me and
bend down roar out
we ar go to kill you white man
i had a pistol in my pocket and could perfectli well have kill
him as i wa much tempt to do a second reflect show
me howev that thi would be useless and in a sens put me in
the wrong though when the matter came on for argument it would
interest me no more so i just fold my arm and look up at
him said
why black man
becaus your face is white he roar
no i answer becaus your heart is black and your ey ar
so full of blood that you do not know macumazahn when you see
him
wow said on it is watcherbynight whom our father knew
befor us leav him alon
no shout the great fellow i will send him to watch where
it is alwai night i who keep a club for white rat and he
brandish hi stick over me
now my temper rose watch my opportun i stretch out my
right foot and hook him round the ankl at the same time
strike up with all my forc my fist caught him beneath the
chin and over he went backward sprawl on the ground
son of a dog i said if a singl stick touch me at least
you shall go first and whip out my revolv i point it
at him
he lai quiet enough but how the matter would have end i do not
know for passion wa run high had not goza at thi moment
risen with a bleed nose and call out
o fool would you kill the king guest to whom the king
himself ha given safeconduct sure you ar pot full of
beer not men
why not answer on thi is the place of soldier the
king hous is yonder give the old jackal a start of a length
of ten assegai if he reach it first he can shake hand with
hi friend the king if not we will make him into medicin
ye ye run for it jackal clamour the other knock
their shield with their stick as men do who would frighten a
buck and open out to make a road for me
now while all thi wa go on with some kind of sixth sens i
had note a big man whose face wa shroud by a blanket thrown
over hi head who veri quietli had join these drunken rioter
and vagu wonder who he might be
i will not run i said slowli that i mai be save by the
king nai i will die here though some of you shall die first
go to the king goza and tell him how hi servant have serv
hi guest and i lift my pistol wait till the first stick
touch me to put a bullet through the bulli on the ground
there is no need said a deep voic that proceed from the
drape man of whom i have spoken for the king ha come to see
for himself
then the blanket wa thrown back reveal cetewayo grown fat
and much ag sinc last i saw him but undoubtedli cetewayo
bayet roar the mob in salut while some of those who had
been most activ in the tumult tri to slip awai
let no man stir said cetewayo and thei stood as though thei
were root to the ground while i slip my pistol back into my
pocket
who ar you white man he ask look at me and what do
you here
the king should know macumazahn i answer lift my hat
whom dingaan knew whom panda knew well and whom the king knew
befor he wa a king
ye i know you he answer although sinc we spoke togeth
you have shrunk like an oxhid in the sun and time ha stain
your beard white
and the king ha grown fat like the ox on summer grass as for
what i do here did not the king send for me by goza and wa i
not brought like a babi in a blanket
the last time we met he went on take no heed of my word
wa yonder at nodwengu when the witch mameena wa tri for
sorceri she who made my brother mad and brought about the great
battl in which you fought for him with the amawomb regiment
do you not rememb how she kiss you macumazahn and took
poison between the kiss and how befor she grew silent she
spoke evil word to me sai that i wa doom to pull down my
own hous and to die as she di word that have haunt me ever
sinc and now haunt me most of all i wish to speak to you
concern them macumazahn for it is said in the land that thi
beauti witch love you alon and that you onli knew her mind
i made no repli who wa heartili tire of thi subject of
mameena whom no on seem abl to forget
well he went on we will talk of that matter alon sinc it
is not natur that you should wish to speak of your dead
darl befor the world and with a wave of the hand he put
the matter asid then suddenli hi attitud chang hi face
that had been thought and almost soft becam fierc hi form
seem to swell and he grew terribl
what wa that dog do he ask of goza point to the
brute whom i had knock down and who still lai prostrat on hi
back afraid to stir
o king answer goza he wa try to kill macumazahn
becaus he is a white man although i told him that he wa your
guest be brought to you by the royal command he wa try
to kill him by give him a start of ten spear length and
make him run to the isigodhlo the king hous and beat
him to death with the stick of these men if thei caught him
which as he is old and thei ar young thei must have done
onli the watcherbynight would not run no although he is so
small he knock him to the earth with hi fist and there he
li that is all o king
rise dog said cetewayo and the man rose trembl with fear
and be bidden gave hi name which i forget
listen dog went on the king in the same cold voic what
goza sai is true for i saw and heard it all with my ey and
ear you would have made yourself as the king you dare to
try to kill the king guest to whom he had given safeconduct
and to stain the king doorpost with hi blood therebi
defil hi hous and show him to the white peopl as a
murder of on of them whom he had promis to protect
macumazahn do you sai how he shall die and i will have it
done
i do not wish him to die i answer i think that he and
those with him were drunk let him go o king
ay macumazahn i will let him go see now we ar in the
centr of the cattlekra and to the eastern gate is as far as
to the isigodhlo let thi man have a start of ten spear
length and run to the eastern gate as he would have made
macumazahn run to the king hous and let hi companion those
who would have hunt macumazahn hunt him
if he win through to the gate he can go on to the govern in
natal and tell them of the cruelti of the zulu onli then let
those who hunt him be brought befor me for trial and perhap
we shall see how thei can run
now the poor wretch caught hold of my hand beg me to
interced for him but soldier who had come up drag him awai
and have measur the distanc allow him set him on a mark
made upon the ground present at a word off he sped like an
arrow and after him went hi friend ten or more of them i
think thei caught him just by the gate doubl like a hare or
so the shout of laughter from the watch regiment told me for
myself i would not look
that dog at hi own stomach said cetewayo grimli therebi
indic in nativ fashion that the biter had been bit or the
engin hoist with hi petard it is long sinc there ha been
a war in the land and some of these young soldier who have
never us an assegai save to skin an ox or cut the head from a
chicken shout too loud and leap too high now thei will be
quieter and while you stai here you mai walk where you will in
safeti macumazahn he ad thoughtfulli
then dismiss the matter from hi mind as we white peopl
dismiss ani trivial incid in a morn stroll he talk for a
few minut to the command offic of the regiment that wa
drill who ran up to make some report to him and walk back
toward the isigodhlo beckon me to follow with goza
after wait for a littl while outsid the gate in the
surround fenc a bodyserv order us to enter which we
did to find the king seat on the shadi side of hi big hut
quit alon at a sign i also sat myself down upon a stool that
had been set for me while goza whose nose wa still bleed
squat at my side
your manner ar not so good as thei were onc macumazahn
said cetewayo present or perhap you have been so long awai
from the royal kraal that you have forgotten it custom
i stare at him wonder what he could mean whereon he ad
with a laugh
what is that in your pocket is it not a load pistol and do
you not rememb that it is death to appear befor the king
arm now i might kill you and have no blame although you ar
my guest for who know that you ar not sent by the english
queen to shoot me
i ask the king pardon i said humbl enough i did not
think about the pistol let your servant take it awai
perhap it is safer in your pocket where i saw you place it in
the cattlekra macumazahn than in their hand which do not
know how to hold such thing moreov i know that you ar not
on who stab in the dark even when our peopl growl round each
other like two dog about to fight and if you were in thi
place your life would have to pai for mine there is beer by
your side drink and fear noth did you see the open of
road goza and if so what is hi answer to my messag
o king i saw him answer goza the father of the doctor
the friend and master of the spirit sai he ha heard the
king word ye that he heard it as it pass the king lip
and that although he is veri old he will travel to ulundi and be
present at the great council of the nation which is to be
summon on the eighth dai from thi that of the full moon yet
he make a prayer of the king it is that a place mai be
prepar for him for hi peopl and for hi servant who carri
him awai from thi town of ulundi where he mai sojourn quit
alon a decre of death be pronounc against ani who attempt
to break in upon hi privaci either where he dwell or upon hi
journei these ar hi veri word o king
i who am the most ancient man in zululand dwell with the
spirit of my father who will not suffer stranger to come nigh
them and who if thei ar offend will bring great woe upon
the land moreov i have sworn that while there is a king in
zululand and i draw the breath of life never again will i set
foot in a royal kraal becaus when last i did so at the slai
of the witch mameena the king who is dead thought it well to
utter threat against me and never more will i the open of
road be threaten by a mortal therefor if the king and hi
council seek to drink of the water of my wisdom it must be in
the place and hour of my own choos if thi cannot be let me
abid here in my hous and let the king seek light from other
doctor sinc mine shall remain as a lamp to my own heart
now i saw that these word greatli disturb cetewayo who fear
zikali as inde did all the land
what doe the old wizard mean he ask angrili he live
alon like a bat in a cave and for year ha been seen of none
yet as a bat fli forth at night rang far and wide in search
of prei so doe hi spirit seem to fly through zululand
everywher i hear the same word it iswhat sai the open of
road it ishow can aught be done unless the open of road
ha declar that it shall be done he who wa here befor the
black on chaka wa born he who it is said wa the friend of
inkosi umkulu the father of the zulu who di befor our
greatgrandfath could rememb he who ha all knowledg and
is almost a spirit if inde he be not a spirit i ask you
macumazahn who ar hi friend what doe he mean and why should
i not kill him and be done
o king i answer in the dai of your uncl dingaan when
dingaan slew the boer who were hi guest and thu began the
war between the white and the black i who wa a lad heard the
laughter of zikali for the first time yonder at the kraal
ungungundhlovu i who rode with retief and escap the slaughter
but hi face i did not see mani year later in the dai of
panda your father i saw hi face and therefor you name me hi
friend yet thi friend who drew me to visit him perhap by
your will o king ha now caus me to be brought here to ulundi
doubtless by your will o king but against my own for who
wish to come to a town where he is wellnigh slain by the first
brawler he meet in the cattl kraal
yet you were not slain macumazahn and perhap you do not know
all the stori of that brawler repli cetewayo almost humbl
like on who beg pardon though the rest of what i had said he
ignor but still you ar zikali friend for between you and
him there is a rope which enabl him to draw you to zululand
which rope i have heard call by a woman name therefor by
the spirit of that woman which still can draw you like a rope i
charg you tell mewhat doe thi old wizard mean and why
should i not kill him and be rid of on who haunt my heart like
an evil vision of the night and as i sometim think is an
umtakati an evildo who would work ill to me and all my
hous ye and to all my peopl
how should i know what he mean o king i answer with
indign though in fact i could guess well enough as for
kill him cannot the king kill whom he will yet i rememb
that onc i heard you father ask much the same question and of
zikali himself sai that he wa mind to find out whether or
no he were mortal like other men i rememb also zikali
answer that there wa a sai that when the open of road
came to the end of hi road there would be no more a king of
zululand as there wa none when first he set foot upon hi road
now i have spoken who am a white man and do not understand your
sai
i rememb it also macumazahn who wa present at the time he
repli heavili my father fear thi zikali and hi father
fear him and i have heard that the black on himself who
fear noth fear him also and i too fear him so much
that i dare not make up my mind upon a great matter without hi
counsel lest he should bewitch me and the nation and bring us to
noth
he paus then turn to goza ask did the open of road
tell you where he wish to dwell when he come to visit me here
at ulundi
o king answer goza yonder in the hill not further awai
than an ag man can walk in the half of an hour is a place
call the vallei of bone becaus there in the dai of those
who went befor the king and even in the king dai mani
evildo have been led to die zikali would dwell in thi
vallei of bone and there and nowher els would meet the king
and the great council not in the daylight but after sunset when
the moon ha risen
why said cetewayo start the place is illomen and
thei sai haunt on that no man dare to approach after the
fall of dark for fear lest the ghost of the dead should leap
upon him gibber
such were the word of the open of road o king repli
goza there and nowher els will he meet the king and there
he demand that three hut should be built to shelter him and hi
folk and store with all thing need if thi be not grant
to him then he refus to visit the king or to give counsel to
the nation
so be it then said cetewayo send messeng to the open
of road goza sai that what he desir shall be done let
my command go out that under pain of death none spy upon him
while he journei hither or return let the hut be built
forthwith and when it is known that he is come let food in
plenti be place in them and afterward morn by morn taken
to the mouth of the vallei bid him announc hi arriv and the
hour he choos for our meet by messeng begon
goza leapt up gave the royal salut and retreat backward
from the presenc of the king leav us alon i also rose to
depart but cetewayo motion to me to be seat
macumazahn he said the great queen man who ha come to
natal sir bartl frere threaten me with war becaus two
evildo women were taken on the natal side of the tugela and
brought back to zululand and kill by mehlokazulu be the
wive of hi father sirayo which wa done without my knowledg
also two white men were driven awai from an island in the tugela
river by some of my soldier
is that all o king i ask
no the queen man sai i kill my peopl without trial which
is a lie told him by the missionari and that girl have been
kill also who refus to marri those to whom thei were given
and ran awai with other men also that wizard ar smelt out and
slain which happen but rare now all of thi contrari to the
promis i made to sompseu when he came to recogn me as king
upon my father death and some other such small matter
what is demand if you would avoid war o king
noth less than thi macumazahn that the zulu armi should be
abolish and the soldier allow to marri whom and when thei
pleas becaus sai the queen man he fear lest it should be
us to attack the english as though i who love the english as
those have done who went befor me desir to lai a finger on
them also that anoth queen man should be sent to dwell here
in my countri to be the ey and ear of the english govern
and have power with me in the land ye and more demand which
would destroi the zulu as a peopl and make me their king but
a petti kraalhead
and what will the king answer i ask
i know not what to answer the fine of two thousand cattl i
will pai for the kill of the women if it mai be i wish no
quarrel with the english though gladli i would have fought the
dutch had not sompseu stretch out hi arm over their land but
how can i disband the armi and make an end of the regiment that
have conquer in so mani war macumazahn i tell you that if i
did thi in a moon i should be dead oh you white peopl think
there is but on will in zululand that of the king but it is
not so for he is but a singl man among ten thousand thousand
who live to work the peopl wish if he beat them with too
thick a stick or if he bring them to shame or doe what the
most of them do not wish then where is the king then i sai
he goe a road that wa trodden by chaka and dingaan who were
befor me ye the red road of the assegai therefor todai i
stand like a man between two fall cliff if i run toward
the english the zulu cliff fall upon me if i run toward my
own peopl the english cliff fall upon me and in either case i
am crush and no more seen tell me then macumazahn you whose
heart is honest what must i do
so he spoke wring hi hand with tear start to hi ey
and upon my word although i never like cetewayo as i had like
hi father panda perhap becaus i love hi brother umbelazi
whom he kill and had known him do mani cruel deed my heart
bled for him
i cannot tell you king i answer think that i must sai
someth but i prai you do not make war against the queen for
she is the most mighti on in the whole earth and though her
foot of which you see but the littl toe here in africa seem
small to you yet if she is anger it will stamp the zulu
flat so that thei ceas to be
mani have told me thi macumazahn ye even uhamu the son of
my uncl unzib or as some sai the son of hi spirit to which
hi mother wa marri after unzib wa dead and other
throughout the land and in truth i think it myself but who can
hold the armi which shout for war ow the council must decid
which mean perhap that zikali will decid for now all hang
upon hi lip
then i am sorri i exclaim
he look at me shrewdli
ar you so am i yet hi counsel must be ask and better
that it should be here in my presenc than yonder secretli at the
black kloof i would kill him if i dare but i dare not who am
surewhi i mai not saythat the same sun will see hi death and
mine
he wave hi hand to show that the talk on thi matter wa end
then ad
macumazahn you ar my prison for a while but give me your
word that you will not try to escap and you mai go where you
will within an hour ride of ulundi i would pai you well to
stop here with me but thi i know you would never do should
there be troubl between us and your peopl therefor i promis
you that if war break out i will send you safe to natal or
perhap sooner as my messeng whenc doubtless you will return
to fight against me know that i have given order that everi
other white man or woman who is found in zululand shall be kill
as a spy even john dunn ha fled or is fly or so i hear
john dunn who ha fed out of my hand and grown rich on my gift
you yourself would have been kill as you came from swaziland
in your cart had not command been sent to those chief through
whose land you pass that neither thei nor their peopl were so
much as to look at you
now for on intens moment i thought as hard as ever i had done
in my life it wa evidentunless he deal veri cunningli
with me which i did not believethat cetewayo knew noth of
anscomb and heda but thought that i had come into zululand
alon should i or should i not tell him and beg hi protect
for them if i did so he might refus or be unabl to give it to
them far awai in the midst of a savag popul aflam with the
lust of war as the incid of the morn show it wa as
much as he could do to protect myself although the zulu knew me
for their friend on the other hand no on who dwelt under
zikali blanket to us the kaffir idiom would be touch
becaus he wa look on as half divin and therefor everyth
under it down to the rat in hi thatch wa sacr now zikali by
implic and nomb with emphasi had promis to safeguard
these two sure therefor thei would run less risk in the
black kloof than here at ulundi if ever thei got so far
all thi went through my brain in an instant with the result
that i made up my mind to sai noth as the issu prove thi
wa a terribl mistak but who can alwai judg rightli had i
spoken out it seem to me probabl that cetewayo would have
grant my prayer and order that these two should be escort
out of zululand befor hostil began although of cours thei
might have been murder on the wai also for a reason that
will becom evid later it is possibl that there would never
have been ani hostil all i can plead is that i act for
the best and fate would have it so anoth moment and the
chanc wa gone
the gate open and a bodyserv appear announc that on
of the great captain with some of hi offic wait to see the
king cetewayo made a sign whereon the servant call out
someth and thei enter three or four of them salut
loudli see me thei stop and stare whereon cetewayo
shortli but with much clear repeat to them and to an
induna who accompani them what he had alreadi said to me
name that i wa hi guest sent for by him that he might us me
as a messeng if he thought fit he ad that the man who
dare to speak a word against me or even to look at me askanc
should pai the price with hi life howev high hi station and
he command that the herald should proclaim thi hi decre
throughout ulundi and the neighbour kraal then he held out
hi hand to me in token of friendship bid me to go softli
and come to see him whenev i wish and dismiss me in charg
of the induna on of the captain and some soldier
within five minut of reach my hut i heard a loudvoic
crier proclaim the order of the king and knew that i had no
more to fear
chapter xiv
the vallei of bone
the week that follow my interview with cetewayo wa inde a
miser time for me for myself as i have said i had no
fear for the king order were strictli obei moreov the
tale of what had happen to the brute who wish to hunt me down
in the cattlekra had travel far and wide and none sought to
share hi fate my hut wa inviol and well suppli with
necessari food as wa my mare and i could wander where i like
and talk with whom i would i could even ride to exercis the
hors though thi i did veri sparingli and onli in the immedi
neighbourhood of the town for fear of excit suspicion or
meet zulu whom the king word had not reach inde on
these occas i wa alwai accompani by a guard of
swiftfoot and arm soldier sent to protect me or more
probabl to kill me if i did anyth that seem suspici
in the cours of my rambl i met sundri nativ whom i had known
in the old dai some of them a long while ago thei all seem
glad to see me and were quit readi to talk of past time but of
the present thei would sai littl or noth except that thei
were certain there would be war of anscomb and heda i could
hear noth and inde did not dare to make ani direct
inquiri concern them but sever reliabl men assur me
that the last missionari and trader have depart there wa
not a white man woman or child left in zululand except myself
it wa all black thei said refer to the colour of their
peopl as it had been befor the time of chaka so i wa forc
to eat out my heart with anxieti in silenc hope and prai
that zikali had plai an honest part and sent them awai safe
why should he not have done so see that it wa my presenc he
had desir not their thei were onli taken or rather snare
becaus thei were with me and could not be separ or so i
believ at the time
on rai of comfort i did get about the fifth dai after my
interview i saw goza who told me that the king messeng were
back from the black kloof and had brought a word for me from
zikali himself the word wa
bid goza sai to macumazahn that i wa sorri not to see him to
sai goodby becaus that morn i slept heavili bid him sai
that i am glad he ha seen the king sinc for thi purpos i
sought hi presenc in zululand bid him sai that he is to fear
noth and that if hi heart is heavi about other whom he
love he should make it light again sinc the spirit have them
in their keep as thei have him and never were thei or he more
safe than thei ar todai
now i look at goza and ask if i could see thi messeng he
repli no as he had alreadi been despatch upon anoth
errand then i ask him if the messeng had said anyth
els he answer ye on thing that he had forgotten name
that the write about blanket should now be in natal then
suddenli he chang the subject and ask me if i would like to
accompani him to the vallei of bone where he wa order to
inspect the hut which were be built for zikali and hi
peopl of cours i said i should hope quit without result
that i might get someth more out of him on the road
now thi town of cetewayo stand or rather stood for it ha
long been burnt on the slope of the hill to the northeast of
the plain of ulundi abov it these hill grow steeper and
deep in the recess of on of them is the vallei of bone
there is noth particularli impos about the place no
tower cliff or pillar of pile granit as at the black
kloof it is just a vale cut out by water border by steep
slope on either side and a still steeper slope strown with
larg rock at it end dot here and there on these slope
grew tall alo that from a littl distanc look like scatter
men whereof the lower leav were shrivel and blacken by
veld fire also there were a few euphorbia grei
nakedlook thing that end in point like finger on a hand
and among them some spars thorn tree struggl to live in an
inhospit soil
the place ha on peculiar jut into it from the hillsid
is a ridg or spur sixti or seventi yard in length by perhap
twenti broad that end in a flat point of rock which stand
about forti feet abov the level of the rest of the littl
vallei on thi ridg also grew tall alo until near it
extrem the soil ceas or had been wash awai from the
waterworn core of rock
it wa and no doubt still is a desolatelook spot at ani
rate for most of the dai when ow to the shadow of the
surround hill it receiv but littl sun everyth about
it especi when i wa there in a time of rain seem dank
and miser although the flat floor of the kloof wa cloth
with a growth of tall coars grass and weed that bore an
evilsmel flower perhap some sens of appropri had
caus the zulu king to choos thi lonesom deathlylook
gorg as on of their execut ground at ani rate mani had
been slain here for skull and the larger human bone some of
them black with ag lai all about among the grass as thei had
been scatter by hyena and jackal thei were particularli
thick beneath and around the tablelik rock that i have
mention
goza told me that thi wa becaus the king slayer made a
custom of drag the victim along the project tongu to the
edg of thi rock and hurl him either dead or live to the
ground beneath or in the case of witch drive them over
after thei had been blind
such wa the spot that zikali had select to abid in dure hi
visit to ulundi certainli where privaci wa an object it wa
well chosen for as cetewayo had said and as goza emphas to
me it had the reput of be the most thoroughli haunt place
in all zululand with the sole except perhap of the ridg
opposit to dingaan old kraal where onc i shot the vultur
for my life and those of my companion even in the daytim
peopl gave it a wide berth and at night noth would induc
them to approach it at ani rate alon
see the book call mari by h rider haggard
here to on side of and near the root of the tongu of land of
which i have spoken the hut that zikali had demand for
himself and hi compani were be rapidli built close to a
spring of water by a larg bodi of men who labour as though
thei wish to be done with their task also about half wai up
the donga for realli it wa noth more at a distanc of
perhap five and twenti pace from it flat point whenc the
condemn were hurl a circular space of ground had been
clear and level which wa larg enough to accommod fifti
or sixti men on thi space goza told me the king and the
council were to sit when thei came to seek light from zikali
in my heart i reflect that the light thei were like to get
from him would be such as mai be suppos to be thrown by hell
fire for be it rememb i knew what these peopl never seem
to understand that zikali wa the most bitter of their enemi
to begin with he wa of undwandw blood on of the peopl whom
the great king chaka had destroi then thi same chaka had
rob him of hi wive and murder hi children in reveng for
which he had plot the slai of chaka as he did that of hi
brother umhlangana and dingaan the latter of whom he involv
in a quarrel with the boer subsequ he brought about the
war between the princ cetewayo and umbelazi in which i plai
a part
now i wa certain that he intend to bring about anoth war
between the english and the zulu know well that in the end
the latter would be destroi and with them the royal hous of
senzangacona which he had sworn to level with the dust had he
not told me as much year ago and wa he on to go back upon hi
word had he not us mameena with her beauti and ambit as
hi tool and when she wa of no further servic to him given
her to death as he had us score of other and in due season
given them to death wa i not myself perhap on of those tool
destin to be thrown into the pit of doom when my turn came
though in what wai i could help hi plot wa more than i could
see sinc he knew well that i should do my best to oppos him
oh i had half a mind to go to cetewayo and tell him all i knew
about zikali even if it involv the break of confid
but stai even if i were believ thi farse wizard held
hostag for my good behaviour and if i betrai him what would
happen to those hostag he sent me messag sai that thei
were safe suggest that thei had escap to natal how wa i
to know that these were true i wa utterli bewild i could
not guess why i had been beguil into zululand and i dare not
step either thi wai or that for fear lest i should fall into
some pit dug by hi cun hand and what wa wors drag down
other with me
moreov wa thi man quit human or perhap an emissari of
satan upon earth who had knowledg deni to other men and a
certain masteri over the power of ill again i could not sai
hi term of life seem to be extraordinarili prolong though
none knew how old exactli he might be also he had a wonder
knowledg of what wa pass in the mind of other and by hi
art as i had experienc onli the other dai could summon up
apparit or illus befor their ey further he wa
awar of event which had happen at a distanc and could send
or read dream sinc otherwis how did nomb know what i had
dreamt at marnham hous lastli he could foretel the futur
as onc he had done in my own case propheci that i should be
injur by a buffalo with a split horn
yet all of thi might be noth more than a mixtur of keen
observ clever spy trickeri and mesmer i could not
sai which it wa nor can i with certainti to thi hour
such were the thought that pass through my mind as i walk
back from the vale of bone by the side of the bigpaunch goza
whom i caught ey me from time to time as a curiou crow ey
ani object that ha attract hi attent
goza i said at last do the zulu realli mean to fight the
english
he turn and point to a spot where the hill ran down into the
great plain here two regiment were manoeuvr on of these
held the slope of the hill and the other wa attack them from
the plain so fierc that at a distanc their onslaught look
like that of actual warfar
that look like fight doe it not macumazahn he repli
ye goza yet it mai be but plai
quit so macumazahn it mai be fight or it mai be but plai
am i a prophet that i should be abl to sai which it is of that
there is but on man in zululand who know the truth it is he
for whom the new hut ar be built up yonder
you think he realli know goza
no macumazahn i do not think i am sure he is the greatest
of all wizard as he wa when my father held on to hi mother
apron he pull the string and the greaton of the countri
danc if he wish war there will be war if he wish peac
there will be peac
and which doe he wish goza
i thought perhap you could tell me that macumazahn who he
sai ar such an old friend of hi also why he choos to
sojourn in a dark hole among the dead instead of in the sunshin
among the live here at ulundi
well i cannot goza sinc the open of road doe not open
hi heart to me but keep hi secret to himself for the rest
those who talk with the dead mai prefer to dwell among the dead
now as alwai you speak truth macumazahn said goza look
at me in a wai which suggest to me that he believ i spoke
anyth but the truth
inde i am convinc he thought that i wa in the council of
zikali and acquaint with hi plan also i am sure he knew
that i had not come to zululand alon the incid of the
blanket which i had promis to him a bribe to keep silenc
show it and suspect that my companion were parti to some
plot togeth with myself and yet at the time i could not be
quit sure and therefor dare not ask anyth concern them
lest thu i should reveal their exist and bring them to
death
as a matter of fact i need not have been anxiou on thi point
sinc if goza who i mai state wa a kind of secret servic
offic as well as a head messeng knew as i think probabl
he had been command by zikali to hold hi tongu under penalti
of a curs perhap the same wa true of the soldier who had
come with him to take me to ulundi the hint of zikali wa as
power as the word of the king sinc thei like thousand of
other believ that wherea cetewayo could kill them zikali
like satan could blast their spirit as well as their bodi
but how wa i to guess all these thing at that time
dure the next two dai noth happen though i heard that
there had been on if not two meet of the council at the
king hous dure which the posit of affair wa discuss
cetewayo i did not see although twice he sent messeng to me
bring gift of food who were charg to inquir whether i wa
well and happi and if ani had offer me hurt or insult to
these i answer that i wa well and unmolest but not happi
who grew lonesom be but a solitari white man among so mani
thousand of the zulu
on the third morn that of the dai of the full moon goza came
and inform me that zikali had arriv at the vallei of bone
befor dawn i ask him how he who wa so old and feebl had
walk so far he answer that he had not walk or so he
understood but had been carri in a litter or rather in two
litter on for himself and on for hi spirit thi stagger
me even where zikali wa concern and i inquir what on earth
goza meant
macumazahn how can i tell you who onli know what i myself am
told he exclaim such is the report that the open of
road ha made himself by messeng to the king none have seen
him for he journei onli in the night moreov when zikali
pass all men ar blind and even women tongu grow dumb
perchanc by hi spirit he mean hi medicin or the
witchdoctoress nomb whom folk sai he creat sinc none
have seen her father or her mother or heard who begat her or
perchanc hi snake is hid behind the mat of the second litter
if in truth there wa on
it mai be so i said feel that it wa useless to pursu the
matter now goza i would see zikali and at onc
that cannot be macumazahn sinc he ha given out that he will
see no on who rest after hi journei and the king ha issu
order that ani who attempt to approach the vallei of bone shall
die even if thei be of the royal blood ye if so much as a
dog dare to draw near that place it must die the soldier who
ring it round have kill on alreadi so strict ar the order
also a boi who went toward it search for a calf which i
think a bad omen
then i will send a messag to him i persist
do so mock goza look yonder sail a vultur ask it to
take your messag for noth els will be not foolish
macumazahn but have patienc for tonight you shall see the
open of road when he attend the council of the king in the
vallei of bone thi is the order of the kingthat at the
rise of the moon i lead you thither so that you mai be present
at the council in case he wish to ask you ani question about
the white peopl or to give you ani messag to the govern in
natal therefor at sunset i will come for you till then
farewel i have busi that cannot wait
can i see the king i cri
not so macumazahn all todai he make sacrific to the
spirit of hi ancestor and must not be approach goza call
back as he depart
avail myself of the permiss of the king to go where i
would a littl later in the dai i walk out of the town toward
the vallei of bone in order to ascertain for myself whether what
goza had told me wa true so it prove for about three hundr
yard from the mouth of the vallei which at that distanc look
like a black hole in the hill i found soldier station about
ten pace apart in a great circl which ran right up the hillsid
and vanish over the crest stroll up to on of these whose
face i thought i knew i ask him if he would let me pass to see
my friend the open of road
the man who wa someth of a humourist repli
certainli if you wish macumazahn that is to sai i will let
your spirit pass but to do thi if you come on step nearer i
must first make a hole in you with my spear out of which it can
fly
i thank him for hi inform and gave him some snuff which
he took gratefulli be bore by hi long vigil then i ask
him how mani peopl the great witchdoctor had with him he said
he did not know but he had seen a number of tall men come to the
mouth of the donga to fetch food that had been place there
again i inquir if he had seen ani women whereon he repli
none zikali be he understood too old to troubl himself
about the other sex just then an offic make hi round
came up and look at me so sternli that i thought it well to
retreat evid there wa no chanc of get through that
line
on my wai back i walk as near the fenc of the king hous as
i dare and saw witchdoctor pass in and out in their
hideou offici panopli thi told me that here also goza had
spoken the truthth king wa perform magic ceremoni
which meant that it would be imposs to approach him in
everi direct i met with failur the fate were against me
it lai over me like a spell inde i grew superstiti and
began to think that zikali had bewitch me as he wa said to
have the power to do well perhap he had for the mere fact of
find myself oppos by thi persist wall of difficulti
and silenc convinc me that there wa someth behind it to be
learn
i went back veri deject to my hut and talk to my mare which
whinni and rub it nose against me for although it wa well
fed and look after the poor beast seem as lone as i wa
myself no wonder sinc like myself it wa separ from all
it kind and weari of inact after thi i at and smoke and
final doze no more for whenev i tri to go to sleep i
thought that i heard zikali laugh at me as mayhap he wa
do yonder in hi hut
at length that wearisom dai drew toward it end the sun began
to sink a huge red ball of fire now and again veil by cloud
for the sky wa stormi it fierc rai strike upon other
cloud peopl the enorm heaven with fantast shape of
light which were thickest over the hill wherein wa the vallei
of bone to my strain mind these cloud look like battl
armi figur of flame war against figur of dark
the dark won no the light broke out again and conquer it
and see there abov them both squat a strang black presenc
crown with fire it might have been that of zikali magnifi
ten thousand time and hark it laugh with the low
reverber voic of distant thunder
suddenli i felt that i wa no longer alon and look round saw
goza at my side
what do you see up there macumazahn that you stare so hard
he ask point at the sky with hi stick
impi fight i answer briefli
then you must be a heavendoctor macumazahn for i onli see
black and red cloud well it is time to go to learn whether or
no the impi will fight for zikali await us and the council ha
start alreadi by the wai the king sai that you will do well
to put your pistol in your pocket in case ani should seek to harm
you in the dark
it is there but goza i prai you to protect me sinc in the
dark bullet fly wide and if i began to shoot on might hit
you goza
he smile make no answer but i notic that dure the rest
of that night he wa care to keep behind me as much as
possibl
our wai led us through the town where everybodi seem to be
stand about do noth and speak veri littl there wa
a curiou air of expect upon their face thei knew that the
crisi wa at hand that their nation fate hung upon the
scale and thei watch my everi look and movement as though in
them thei expect to read an omen i too watch them out of
the corner of my ey wonder whether i should escap from
their savag compani aliv if onc the blood lust broke out
among them it seem to me that i should have about as much
chanc as a chop fox among a pack of hungri hound
onc out of the town we saw no on until we came to the circl of
guard which i have alreadi mention who stood there like an
endless line of black statu in answer to their challeng goza
gave some complic password in which my name occur whereon
thei open out and let us through then we march on to the
mouth of the kloof the place wa veri dark for now the sun wa
down in the west and the moon in the east wa cut off from us by
the hill and would not be visibl here for half an hour or more
present i saw a spot of light it wa a small fire burn
near the tongu of rock which i have describ
at a distanc in front of the fire on the patch of prepar
ground squat a number of men between twenti and thirti of
them in a semicircl thei were wrap up in kaross and
blanket and in their centr sat a larg figur on a chair of
wood
the king and the great council whisper goza
on of them look round and saw us at some sign from the king
he rose and against the fire i saw that he wa the prime
minist umnyamana he came to me and with a nod of
recognit conduct me some pace to the right where a
euphorbia tree grew among the rank herbag here i found a stool
place readi on which i sat down goza who of cours wa not of
the council squat at my side in the grass
now i found that i wa so situat that i could not well be seen
from the fire or even from the rock abov it while i by move
my head a littl could see both quit clearli after thi as
the last reflect from the sunk sun fade the dark
increas until noth remain visibl except the fire and the
massiv outlin of the rock behind the silenc wa complet
for none of the council spoke thei were so still that thei
might have been dead so still that a beetl suddenli boom
past me made me start as though it had been a bullet the
gener impress wa almost mesmer i felt as though i were
go to sleep and yet my mind remain painfulli awak so that
i wa abl to think thing out
i understood clearli that the bodi of men to my left had come
togeth to decid whether there should be peac or war that
there were divis of opinion among them that the king wa
readi to follow the parti which should prove itself the
strongest but that the real voic of decis would speak from
behind that fire it wa the case of the delphic oracl over
again with a priest instead of a priestess and what a priest
it wa evid to me also that zikali who knew human natur and
especi savag human natur had arrang all thi with a view
to scenic and inde supernatur effect moreov he had done
it veri well sinc i knew myself that in thi place and hour
word and occurr would affect me deepli at which i should
have laugh in the sunlight and open plain alreadi the zulu
were affect for i could hear the teeth of some of them
chatter and goza began to shiver at my side he mutter
that it wa cold and li for the donga wa extrem hot and
stuffi
at length the silver radianc of the moon spread itself on the
high curtain of the dark then the edg of her orb appear
abov the hill and an arrow of white light fell into the littl
vallei it struck upon and about the jut rock reveal a
misshapen whitehead figur squat between it base and the
fire the figur of zikali
chapter xv
the great council
none had seen or heard him come and though doubtless he had but
crept round the rock and taken hi place in the dark there
appear to be someth mysteri about thi sudden appear
of zikali so the zulu nobl thought at ani rate for thei
utter a low ow of fear and wonder
there he sat like a huge ap stare at the sky for the
firelight shone on hi deep and burn ey the moonlight
increas but now and again it wa broken by littl cloud which
caus strang shadow to appear about the rock some of these
shadow look as though veil figur were approach the
wizard bend over him and depart again after give him
their messag or counsel
hi spirit visit him whisper goza but i made no answer
thi went on for quit a long time until the full round of the
moon appear abov the hill inde and for the while the
cloud had clear awai still zikali sat silent and i who wa
acquaint with the habit of thi peopl knew that i wa
wit a conflict between two thei consid to be
respect a spiritu and an earthli king it is my belief
that unless he were first address zikali would have sat all
night without open hi lip possibl cetewayo would have
done the same if the impati of public opinion had allow
him at ani wa rate it wa he who gave wai
makosi master of mani spirit on behalf of the council and the
peopl of the zulu i the king greet you here in the place that
you have chosen said cetewayo
zikali made no answer
the silenc went on as befor till at length after a paus and
some whisper cetewayo repeat hi salut ad
ha ag made you deaf o open of road that you cannot hear
the voic of the king
then at last zikali answer in hi low voic that yet seem to
fill all the kloof
nai child of senzangacona ag ha not made me deaf but my
spirit in these latter dai float far from my bodi it is like
a bladder fill with air that a child hold by a string and
befor i can speak i must draw it from the heaven to earth
again what did you sai about the place that i have chosen
well what better place could i choos see that it wa here
in thi veri vale of bone that i met the first king of the
zulu chaka the wild beast who wa your uncl why then should
i not choos it to meet the last king of the zulu
now i listen knew at onc that thi sai might be
understood in two wai name that cetewayo wa the reign
king or that he wa the last king who would ever reign but the
council interpret it in the latter and wors sens for i saw a
quiver of fear go through them
why should i not choos it went on zikali see also that
thi place is holi to me here it wa o son of panda that
chaka brought my children to be kill and forc me sit
where you sit to watch their death there on the rock abov me
thei were kill four of them three son and a daughter and
the slayersthei came to an evil end those slayer as did
chakalaugh and cast them down from the rock befor me ye
and chaka laugh and i too laugh for had not the king the
right to kill my children and to steal their mother and wa i
not glad that thei should be taken from the world and gather
to that of spirit whenc thei alwai talk to me ye even now
that is why i did not hear you at first king becaus thei were
talk to me
he paus turn on ear upward then continu in a new and
tender voic what is it you sai to me noma my dear littl
noma oh i hear you i hear you
now he shift himself along the ground on hi haunch some
pace to the right and began to search about grope with hi
long finger where where he mutter oh i understand

hard is thi soil ah i have it but look noma a stone ha

skull to hi lip he kiss it then set it down in front of him
between himself and the fire with the face part point to the
king and burst into on of hi eeri and terribl laugh
a low moan went up from hi audienc and i felt the skin of
goza who had shrunk against me break into a profus sweat
then suddenli zikali voic chang on more and becam hard and
businesslik if i mai call it so similar to that of other
profession doctor
you have sent for me o king as those who went befor you have
sent when great thing were about to happen what is the matter
on which you would speak to me
you know well open of road answer cetewayo rather
shakili i thought the matter is on of peac or war the
english threaten me and my peopl and make great demand on me
amongst other that the armi should be disband i can set them
all out if you will if i refus to do as thei bid me then
within a few dai thei will invad zululand inde their
soldier ar alreadi gather at the drift
it is not need king answer zikali sinc i know what
all know neither more nor less the wind whisper the demand
of the white men the bird sing them the hyena howl them at
night let us see how the matter stand when your father di
sompseu sir t shepston the great white chief came from the
english govern to name you king thi he could not do
accord to our law sinc how can a stranger name the king of
the zulu therefor the council of the nation and the doctorsi
wa not among them kingmov the spirit of chaka the lion into
the bodi of sompseu and made him as chaka wa and gave him power
to name you to rule over the zulu so it came about that to the
english queen through the spirit of chaka you swore certain
thing that slai for witchcraft should be abolish that no
man should die without fair and open trial and other matter
he paus a while then went on these oath you have broken o
king as be of the blood you ar and what you ar you must
do
here there wa disturb among the council and cetewayo half
rose from hi seat then sat down again zikali gaze at the
sky wait till it had di awai then went on
do ani question my word if so then let them ask of the white
men whether thei be true or no let them ask also of the spirit
of those who have di for witchcraft and of the spirit of the
women who have been slain and whose bodi were laid at the
crossroad becaus thei marri the men thei chose and not the
soldier to whom the king gave them
how can i ask the white men who ar far awai broke out
cetewayo ignor the rest
ar the white men so far awai king it is true that i see none
and hear none yet i seem to smell on of them close at hand
here he took up the skull which he had laid down and whisper to
it ah i thank you my child it seem king that there is a
white man here hidden in thi kloof he who is name macumazahn
a good man and a truth known to mani of us from of old who
can tell you what hi peopl think though he is not on of their
induna if you question my word ask him
we know what the white men think said cetewayo so there is
no need to ask macumazahn to sing us an old song the question
iswhat must the zulu do must thei swallow their spear and
ceas to be a nation becom servant or must thei strike with
them and drive the english into the sea and after them the
boer
tell me first king who dwell far awai and alon know
littl of what pass in the land of life what the zulu desir
to do befor me sit the great council of the nation let it
speak
then on by on the member of the council utter their opinion
in order of rank or senior i do not rememb the name of
all who were present or what each of them said i recal
howev that sigananda a veri old chiefh must have been over
ninetyspok the first he told them that he had been friend of
chaka and on of hi captain and had fought in most of hi
battl that afterward he had been a gener of dingaan
until that king kill the boer under retief when he left him
and final side with panda in the civil war in which dingaan
wa kill with the help of the boer that he had been present
at the battl of the tugela though he took no actual part in the
fight and afterward becam a councillor of panda and then
of cetewayo hi son it wa a long and interest histor
recit cover the whole period of the zulu monarchi which
end suddenli with these word
i have note o king and councillor that whenev the black
vultur of the zulu wa content to attack bird of hi own
feather he ha conquer but when it ha met the grei eagl
of the white men which come from over the sea he ha been
conquer and my heart tell me that as it wa in the past so
it shall be in the futur chaka wa a friend of the english so
wa panda and so ha cetewayo been until thi hour i sai
therefor let not the king tear the hand which fed him becaus
it seem weak lest it should grow strong and clutch him by the
throat and choke him
next spoke undabuko dabulamanzi and magwenga brother of the
king who all favour war though the two last were guard in
their speech after these came uhamu the king uncleh who
wa said to be the son of a spiritwho wa strong for peac
urg that the king should submit to the demand of the english
make the best term he could that he should bend like a reed
befor the storm so that after the storm had swept by he might
stand up straight again and with him all the other reed of the
peopl of the zulu
so too said seketwayo chief of the umdhlalosi and more whom i
cannot recal six or seven of them but usibebu and the induna
untshingwayo who afterward command at isandhlwana were for
fight as were sirayo the husband of the two women who had
been taken on english territori and kill and umbilini the
chief of swazi blood whose surrend wa demand by sir bartl
frere and who afterward command the zulu in the battl at
ihloban last of all spoke the prime minist umnyamana who
declar fierc that if the zulu buffalo hid itself in the
swamp like a timid calf when the white bull challeng it on the
hill the spirit of chaka and all hi forefath would thrust
it head into the mud and choke it
when all had finish cetewayo spoke sai
that is a bad council which ha two voic for to which of them
must the captain listen when the impi of the foe gather in front
of him here i have sat while the moon climb high and count
and what do i find that on half of you men of wisdom and
renown sai ye and that the other half of you men of wisdom
and renown sai no which then is it to be ye or no ar we
to fight the english or ar we to sit still
that is for the king to decid said a voic
see what it is to be a king went on cetewayo with passion
if i declar for war and we win shall i be greater than i am
if victori give me more land more subject more wive and more
cattl what is the us of these thing to me who alreadi have
enough of all of them and if defeat should take everyth from
me even my life perhap then what shall i have gain i will
tell youth curs of the zulu upon my name from father to son
for ever thei will sai cetewayo son of panda pull down a
hous that onc wa great becaus of some small matter he
quarrel with the english who were alwai the friend of our
peopl and brought the zulu to the dust sintwangu my
messeng who brought heavi word from the queen induna which
we must answer with other word or with spear sai that the
english soldier in natal ar few so few that we zulu can
swallow them like bit of meat and still be hungri but ar
these all the soldier of the english i am not sure you ar
on of that peopl macumazahn he ad turn hi massiv
shape toward me tell us now how mani soldier ha your
queen
king i answer i do not know for certain but if the zulu
can muster fifti thousand spear the queen if there be need
can send against them ten time fifti thousand and if she grow
angri anoth ten time fifti everi on arm with a rifl that
will fire five bullet a minut and to accompani the soldier
hundr of cannon whereof a singl shot would give ulundi to the
flame out of the sea thei will come shipload after shipload
white men from where the sun set and black men from where the
sun rise so mani that zululand would not hold them
now at these word which i deliv as grandli as i could
someth like a groan burst from the council though on man
cri
do not listen to the white traitor o king who is sent here to
turn our heart to water with hi li
macumazahn mai lie to us went on cetewayo though in the past
none in the land have ever known him to lie but he wa not sent
to do so for i brought him here for my part i do not believ
that he li i believ that these english ar as mani as the
pebbl in a river bed and that to them natal ye and all the
cape is but as a singl outli cattl kraal on cattl kraal
out of a hundr did not sompseu onc tell us that thei were
countless on that dai when he came mani year ago after the
battl of the tugela to name me to succe my father panda the
dai when my faction the usutu roar round him for hour like a
river in flood and he sat still like a rock in the centr of a
river also i am mind of the word that chaka said when
dingaan and umbopa had stab him and he lai dy at the kraal
duguza that although the dog of hi own hous whom hi hand
fed had eaten him up he heard the sound of the run of the
feet of a great white peopl that should stamp them and the zulu
flat
he paus and the silenc wa so intens that the crackl of
zikali fire which kept on burn brightli although i saw no
fuel ad to it sound quit loud present it wa broken
first by a dog near at hand howl horribl at the moon and
next by the hoot of a great owl that flit across the donga
the shadow of it wide wing fall for a moment on the king
listen exclaim cetewayo a dog that howl methink that
it stand upon the roof of the hous of senzangacona and an owl
that hoot methink that owl ha it nest in the world of
spirit ar these good omen councillor i trow not i sai
that i will not decid thi matter of peac or war if there is
on of my own blood here who will do so come let him take my
place and let me go awai to my own lordship of gikazi that i had
when i wa a princ befor the witch mameena who plai with all
men and love but oneher everybodi turn and stare toward
me ye even zikali whom noth els had seem to move till i
wish that the ground would swallow me upcaus the war
between me and my brother umbelazi whose blood earth will not
swallow nor sun dry
how can that be o king broke in umnyamana the prime minist
how can ani of your race sit in your seat while you still live
then inde there would be war war between tribe and tribe and
zulu and zulu till none were left and the white hyena from
natal would come and chew our bone and with them the boer that
have pass the vaal see now why is thi nyanga ie
witchdoctor here and he point to zikali beyond the fire
why ha the open of road been brought from the black kloof
which he ha not left for year is it not that he mai give us
counsel in our need and show us a sign that hi counsel is good
whether it be for war or peac then when he ha made divin
and given the counsel and shown the sign then o king do you
speak the word of war or peac and send it to the queen by
yonder white man and by that word we the peopl will abid
at thi suggest which i had no doubt wa made by some secret
agreement between umnyamana and zikali cetewayo seem to grasp
perhap thi wa becaus it postpon for a littl while the
dread moment of decis or perhap becaus he hope that in
the ey of the nation it would shift the respons from hi
shoulder to those of the spirit speak through the lip of
their prophet at ani rate he nod and answer
it is so let the open of road open us a road through the
forest and the swamp and the rock of doubt danger and fear
let him give us a sign that it is a good road on which we mai
safe travel and let him tell us whether i shall live to walk
that road and what i shall meet thereon i promis him in return
the greatest fee that ever yet wa paid to a doctor in zululand
now zikali lift hi big head shook hi grei lock and open
hi wide mouth as though he expect manna to fall into it from
the sky he laugh out loud
ohoho he laugh ohohohoo it is worth while to have
live so long when life ha brought me to such an hour as thi
what is it that my ear hear that i the indwand dwarf i whom
chaka name thethingthatnevershouldhavebeenborn i on
of the race conquer and despis by the zulu am here to speak
a word which the zulu dare not utter which the king of the
zulu dare not utter ohohoho and what doe the king offer
to me a fee a great fee for the word that shall paint the
zulu red with blood or white with the slime of shame nai i
take no fee that is the price of blood or shame befor i speak
that word unknownfor as yet my heart ha not heard it and what
the heart ha not heard the lip cannot shapei ask but on
thing it is an oath that whatev follow on the word while
there is a zulu left live in the world i the voic of the
spirit shall be safe from hurt or from reproach i and those of
my hous and those over whom i throw my blanket be thei black or
be thei white that is my fee without which i am silent
izwa we hear you we swear it on behalf of the peopl said
everi councillor in the semicircl in front of him ye and the
king said it also stretch out hi hand
good said zikali it is an oath it is an oath sworn here
upon the bone of the dead evildo you call them but i sai
to you that mani of those who sit befor me have more evil in
their heart than had those dead well let it be proclaim o
king and with it thisthat ill shall it go with him who break
the oath with hi famili with hi kraal and all with whom he
ha to do
now what is it you ask of me first of all counsel as to
whether you should fight the english queen a matter on which
you the great on ar evenli divid in opinion as is the
nation behind you o king induna and captain who am i that
i should judg of such a matter which is beyond my trade a
matter of the world abov and of men bodi not of the world
below and of men spirit yet there wa on who made the zulu
peopl out of noth as a potter fashion a vessel from clai
as a smith fashion an assegai out of the or of the hill ye
and temper it with human blood chaka the lion the wild
beast the king among king the conqueror i knew chaka as i
knew hi father ye and hi father other still live knew
him also sai you sigananda there for instanc and he point
to the old chief who had spoken first ye sigananda knew him
as a boi know a great man as a soldier know a gener but i
knew hi heart ay i shape hi heart i wa it thought had
it not been for me he would never have been great then he
wrong meher zikali took up the skull which he said wa that
of hi daughter and stroke itand i left him
the old zulu smith dip their choicest blade in the blood
of mena q
he wa not wise he should have kill on whom he had wrong
but perhap he knew that i could not be kill perhap he had
tri and found that he wa but throw spear at the moon which
fell back on hi own head i forget it is so long ago and
what doe it matter at least i took awai from him the prop of
my wisdom and he fellto rise no more and so it ha been with
other so it ha been with other yet while he wa great i
knew hi heart who live in hi heart and therefor i ask
myself had he been sit where the king sit todai what
would chaka have done i will tell you if not onli the english
but the boer also and with them the pondo the basuto and all
the tribe of africa had threaten him he would have fought
themy and set hi heel upon their neck therefor
although i give no counsel upon such a matter i sai to you that
the counsel of chaka isfightand conquer hearken to it or
pass it byi care not which
he paus and a loud ow of wonder and admir rose from hi
audienc myself i nearli join in it for i thought thi on
of the cleverest bit of statecraft that ever i had heard of or
seen the old wizard had taken no respons and given no
answer to the demand for advic all thi he had thrust on to
the shoulder of a dead man and that man on whose name wa
magic to everi zulu the king whose memori thei ador the
great gener who had gorg them with victori and power
speak as chaka after a long period of peac he urg them
onc more to lift their spear and know the joi of triumph
therebi make themselv the greatest nation in southern africa
from the moment i heard thi cun appeal i know what the end
would be all the rest wa but of minor and semiperson
interest i knew also for the first time how truli great wa
zikali and wonder what he might have becom had fortun set him
in differ circumst among a civil peopl
now he wa speak again and quickli befor the impress di
awai
such is the word of chaka spoken by me who wa hi secret
councillor the councillor who wa seldom seen and never heard
doe not sigananda yonder know the voic which amongst all those
present echo in hi ear alon
i know it cri the old chief then with hi ey start
almost from hi head sigananda leapt up and rais hi hand
gave the royal salut the bayet to the spirit of chaka as
though the dead king stood befor him
i think that most of those there thought that it did stand befor
him for some of them also gave the bayet and even cetewayo
rais hi arm
sigananda squat down again and zikali went on
you have heard thi captain of the lion know hi voic so
that is done with now you ask of me someth elsethat i who
am a doctor the oldest of all the doctor and it is thoughti
know notth wisest should be abl to answer you ask of
mehow shall thi war prosper if it is madeand what shall
chanc to the king dure and after the war and lastli you ask
of me a sign what i tell to you is true is it not so
it is true answer the council
ask is easi continu zikali in a grumbl voic but
answer is anoth matter how can i answer without
prepar without the need medicin also that i have not
with me who did not know what would be sought of me who thought
that my opinion wa desir and no more go awai now and return
on the sixth night and i will tell you what i can do
not so cri the king we refus to go for the matter is
immedi speak at onc open of road lest it should be
said in the land that after all you ar but an ancient cheat a
stick that snap in two when it is leant on
ancient cheat i rememb that is what macumazahn yonder onc
told me i am though afterwardsperhap he wa right for who in
hi heart know whether or not he be a cheat a cheat who
deceiv himself and through himself other a stick that snap
in two when it is leant on some have thought me so and some
have thought otherwis well you would have answer which i
know not how to give be without medicin and in face of those
who ar quit ignor and therefor cannot lend me their
thought as it sometim happen that men do when worker of
evil ar sought out in the common fashion for then as you mai
have guess it is the evildo who himself tell the doctor of
hi crime though he mai not know that he is tell it yet
there is anoth stone that i alon can throw anoth plan that
i alon can practis and that not alwai but of thi i would
not make us sinc it is terribl and might frighten you or even
send you back to your hut rave so that your wive ye and
the veri dog fled from you
he stop and for the first time did someth to hi fire for
i saw hi hand go backward and forward as though he warm
them at the flame
at length an aw voic i think it wa that of dabulamanzi
ask
what is thi plan inyanga let us hear that we mai judg
the plan of call on from the dead and hearken to the
voic of the dead is it your desir that i should draw water
from thi fount of wisdom o king and councillor
chapter xvi
war
now men began to whisper togeth and goza groan at my side
rather would i look down a live lion throat than see the
dead he murmur but i who wa anxiou to learn how far
zikali would carri hi trick contemptu told him to be
silent
present the king call me to him and said
macumazahn you white men ar report to know all thing tell
me now is it possibl for the dead to appear
i am not sure i answer doubtfulli some sai that it is and
some sai that it is not possibl
well said the king have you ever seen on you knew in life
after death
no i repli that isy that isi do not know when
you will tell me king where wake end and sleep begin then
i will answer
macumazahn he exclaim just now i announc that you were
no liar who perceiv that after all you ar a liar for how can
you both have seen and not seen the dead inde i rememb
that you li long ago when you gave it out that the witch
mameena wa not your lover and afterward show that she wa by
kiss her befor all men for who kiss a woman who is not hi
lover or hi mother return sinc you will not tell me the
truth
so i went back to my stool feel veri small and yet indign
for how wa it possibl to be definit about ghost or to
explain the exact fact of the mameena myth which clung to me
like a waitabit thorn
then after a littl consult cetewayo said
it is our desir o open of road that you should draw wisdom
from the fount of death if inde you can do so now let ani
who ar afraid depart and wait for us who ar not afraid alon
and in silenc at the mouth of the kloof
at thi some of the audienc rose but after hesit a littl
sat down again onli goza actual took a step forward but on
my remark that he would probabl meet the dead come up that
wai collaps mutter someth about my pistol for the fool
seem to think i could shoot a spirit
if inde i can do so repeat zikali in a careless fashion
that is to be prove is it not perhap too it mai be better
for everi on of you if i fail than if i succe of on thing i
warn you should the dead appear stir not and abov all touch
not for he who doe either of these thing will i think never
live to look upon the sun again but first let me try an easier
fashion
then onc again he took up the skull that he said had been hi
daughter and whisper to it onli to lai it down present
it will not serv he said with a sigh and shake hi lock
noma tell me that she di a child on who had no knowledg of
war or matter of polici and that in all these thing of the
world she still remain a child she sai that i must seek some
on who thought much of them on too who still live in the
heart of a man who is present here if that be possibl sinc
from such a heart alon can the strength be drawn to enabl the
dead to appear and speak now let there be silencelet there be
silenc and woe to him that break it
silenc there wa inde and in it zikali crouch himself down
till hi head almost rest on hi knee and seem to go to
sleep he awok again and chant for half a minut or so in
some languag i could not understand then voic began to
answer him as it seem to me from all over the kloof also from
the sky or rock abov whether the effect wa produc by
ventriloqu or whether he had confeder post at variou
point i do not know
at ani rate thi lord of multitud of spirit seem to be
engag in convers with some of them what is more the
thing wa extrem well done sinc each voic differ from the
other also i seem to recogn some of them dingaan for
instanc and panda ye and that of umbelazi the handsom
the brother of the king whose death i wit down by the
tugela
you will ask me what thei said i do not know either the word
were confus or the event that follow have blot them from
my brain all i rememb is that each of them seem to be
speak of the zulu and their fate and to be veri anxiou to
refer further discuss of the matter to some on els in
short thei seem to talk under protest or that wa my
impress although goza the onli person with whom i had ani
subsequ debat upon the subject appear to have gather on
that wa differ though what it wa i do not recal the onli
word that remain clear to me must i thought have come from
the spirit of chaka or rather from zikali or on of hi
myrmidon assum that charact thei were utter in a deep
full voic spice with mockeri and receiv by the wizard with
sibonga or titl of prais which i who am vers in zulu
histori and idiom knew had onli been given to the great king and
inde sinc hi death had becom unlaw not to be us the
word were
what thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn do you think
yourself a thingthatshouldneverdi that you still sit
beneath the moon and weav witchcraft as of old often have i
hunt for you in the underworld who have an account to settl
with you as you have an account to settl with me so so what
doe it matter sinc we must meet at last even if you hide
yourself at the back of the furthest star why do you bring me
up to thi place where i see some whom i would forget ye thei
build bone on bone and take the red earth mould it into flesh
and stand befor me as last i saw them newli dead oh your
magic is good spellweav and your hate is deep and your
vengeanc is keen no i have noth to tell you todai who
rule a greater peopl than the zulu in anoth land who ar
these littl men who sit befor you on of them ha a look of
dingaan my brother who slew me ye and wear hi armlet is
he the king answer not for i do not care to know sure
yonder wither thing is sigananda i know hi ey and the iziqu
on hi breast ye i gave it to him after the great battl with
zweed in which he kill five men doe he rememb it i
wonder greet sigananda old as you ar you have still
twenti and on year to live and then we will talk of the battl
with zweed let me begon thi place burn my spirit and in
it there is a stench of mortal blood farewel o conqueror
these were the word that i thought i heard chaka sai though i
daresai that i dreamt them inde had it been otherwis i mean
had thei realli been spoken by zikali there would sure have
been more in them someth that might have serv hi purpos
not mere talk which had all the inconsequ of a dream also
no on els seem to pai ani particular attent to them
though thi mai have been becaus so mani voic were sound
from differ place at onc for as i have said zikali
arrang hi perform veri well as well as ani medium could
have done on a prepar stage in london
in a moment as though at a signal the voic di awai then
other thing happen to begin with i felt veri faint as
though all the strength were be taken out of me some queer
fanci got a hold of me i dont quit know what it wa but it
had to do with the bibl stori of adam when he fell asleep and a
rib wa remov from him and made into a woman i reflect that
i felt as adam must have done when he came out of hi tranc
after thi terrif oper veri weak and empti also as it
chanc present i saw eveor rather a woman look at the
fire in a kind of disembodi wai i perceiv that dens smoke
wa rise from it which smoke spread itself out like a fan it
thin by degre and through the veil of smoke i perceiv
someth els name a woman veri like on whom onc i had
known there she stood lightli clad enough her finger plai
with the blue bead of her necklac an inscrut smile upon
her face and her larg ey fix on nothing
oh heaven i knew her or rather thought i did at the moment
for now i am almost sure that it wa nomb dress or undress
for the part that knowledg came with reflect but then i
could have sworn be deceiv by the uncertain light that the
long dead mameena stood befor us as she had seem to stand
befor me in the hut of zikali radiat a kind of supernatur
life and beauti
a littl wind aros shake the dry leav of the alo in the
kloof i thought it whisperedhail mameena some of the
older men too among them a few who had seen her die in
trembl voic murmur it is mameena whereon zikali
scowl at them and thei grew silent
as for the figur it stood there patient and unmov like on
who ha all time at it dispos plai with the blue bead i
heard them tinkl against each other which prove that it wa
human for how could a wraith caus bead to tinkl although it
is true that christmasstori ghost ar said to clank their
chain her ey rove idli and without interest over the
semicircl of terrifi men befor her then by degre thei
fix themselv upon the tree behind which i wa crouch
whereon goza sank paralyz to the ground she contempl thi
tree for a while that seem to me intermin it remind me
of a setter point game it wind but could not see for her
whole frame grew intent and alert she ceas plai with the
bead and stretch out her slender hand toward me her lip
move she spoke in a sweet slow voic sai
o watcherbynight is it thu you greet her to whom you have
given strength to stand onc more beneath the moon come hither
and tell me have you no kiss for on from whom you part with a
kiss
i heard without doubt the voic wa the veri voic of mameena
so well had nomb been instruct still i determin not to
obei it who would not be made a public laughingstock for a
second time in my life also i confess thi jest with the
dead seem to me somewhat unholi and not on ani account would i
take a part in it
all the compani turn and stare at me even goza lift hi
head and stare but i sat still and contempl the beauti of
the night
if it is the spirit of mameena he will come whisper
cetewayo to umnyamana
ye ye answer the prime minist for the rope of hi
love will draw him he who ha onc kiss mameena must kiss
her again when she ask
hear thi i grew furious indign and wa about to break
into explan when to my horror i found myself rise from
that stool i tri to cling to it but as it onli came into
the air with me let it go
hold me goza i mutter and he like a good fellow clutch
me by the ankl whereon i promptli kick him in the mouth at
least my foot kick him not my will now i wa walk toward
that shapeshadow or womanlik a man in hi sleep and as i
came she stretch out her arm and smile oh as sweetli as an
angel though i felt quit sure that she wa noth of the sort
now i stood opposit to her alongsid the fire of which the smoke
smelt like rose at the dawn and she seem to bend toward me
with shame and humili i perceiv that in anoth moment
those arm would be about me but somehow thei never touch me
i lost sight of them in the rosesc smoke onli the sweet
slow voic which i could have sworn wa that of mameena murmur
in my earwel word known to her and me alon that i had never
breath to ani live be though of cours i am awar now
that thei must also have been known to somebodi els
do you doubt me ani longer went on the murmur sai am i
nomb now oror am i in truth that mameena whose kiss thrill
your lip and soul hearken macumazahn for the time is short
in the rout of the great battl that shall be do not fly with
the white men but set your face toward ulundi on who wa
your friend will guard you and whoever di no harm shall come
to you now that the fire which burn in my heart ha set all
zululand aflam hearken onc more han the littl yellow man
who wa name lightindark he who di among the kendah
peopl send you salut and give you prais he bid me
tell you that now of hi own accord he render to me mameena
the royal salut becaus royal i must ever be becaus also he
and i who ar so far apart ar yet on in the love that is our
life
the smoke blew into my face caus me to reel back cetewayo
caught me by the arm sai
tell us ar the lip of the dead witch warm or cold
i do not know i groan for i never touch her
how he li oh how he li even about what our ey saw
said cetewayo reflect as i blunder past him back to my
seat on which i sank half swoon when i got my wit again
the figur that pretend to be mameena wa speak i suppos
in answer to some question of zikali which i had not heard it
said
o lord of the spirit you have call me from the land of
spirit to make repli as to two matter which have not yet
happen upon the earth these repli i will give but no
other sinc the mortal strength that i have borrow return
whenc it came the first matter is if there be war between the
white and black what will happen in that war i see a plain
ring round with hill and on it a strangeshap mount i see
a great battl i see the white men go down like corn befor a
tempest i see the spear of the impi redden i see the white
soldier lie like leav cut from a tree by frost thei ar
dead all dead save a hand that have fled awai i hear the
ingoma of victori sung here at ulundi it is finish
the second matter iswhat shall chanc to the king i see him
toss on the black water i see him in a land full of hous
talk with a royal woman and her councillor there too he
conquer for thei offer him tribut of mani gift i see him
here back here in zululand and hear him greet with the royal
salut last of all i see him dead as men must die and hear
the voic of zikali and the mourn of the women of hi hous
it is finish farewel king cetewayo i pass to tell panda
your father how it fare with you when last we part did i
not prophesi to you that we should meet again at the bottom of a
gulf wa it thi gulf think you or anoth on dai you
shall learn farewel or fare ill as it mai happen
onc more the smoke spread out like a fan when it thin and
drew togeth again the shape wa gone
now i thought that the zulu would be so impress by thi veri
queer exhibit that thei would seek no more supernatur
guidanc but make up their mind for war at onc thi
howev wa just what thei did not do as it happen among
the assembl chief wa on who himself had a great reput as a
witchdoctor and therefor burn with jealousi of zikali who
appear to be abl to do thing that he had never even
attempt thi man leapt up and declar that all which thei
had seem to hear and see wa but cun trickeri carri out
after long prepar by zikali and hi confeder the
voic he said came from person place in certain spot or
sometim were produc by zikali himself as for the vision it
wa not that of a spirit but of a real woman in proof of which
he call attent to certain anatom detail of the figur
final with much sens he point out that the council would
be mad to come to ani decis upon such evid or to give
faith to propheci whereof the truth or falsiti could onli be
known in the futur
now a fierc debat broke out the war parti maintain that the
manifest were genuin the peac parti that thei were a
fraud in the end as neither side would give wai and as zikali
when appeal to sat silent as a stone refus ani
explan the king said
must we sit here talk talk till daylight there is but
on man who can know the truth that is macumazahn let him deni
it as he will he wa the lover of thi mameena while she wa
aliv for with my own ey i saw him kiss her befor she kill
herself it is certain therefor that he know if the woman we
seem to see wa mameena or anoth sinc there ar thing
which a man never forget i propos therefor that we should
question him and form our own judgment of hi answer
thi advic which seem to promis a road out of a blind alli
met with instant accept
let it be so thei cri with on voic and in anoth minut
i wa onc more conduct from behind my tree and set down upon
the stool in front of the council with my back to the fire and
zikali that hi ey might not charm me
now watcherbynight said cetewayo although you have li
to us in a certain matter of thi we do not think much sinc it
is on upon which both men and women alwai lie as everi judg
will know therefor we still believ you to be an honest man
as your deal have prove for mani year as an honest man
therefor we beg you to give us a true answer to a plain
question wa the shape we saw befor us just now a woman or a
spirit and if a spirit wa it the ghost of mameena the
beauti witch who di near thi place nearli the quarter of a
hundr year ago she whom you love or who love you which is
just the same thing sinc a man alwai love a woman who love
him or think that he doe
now after reflect i repli in these word and as
conscienti as i could
king and councillor i do not know if what we all saw wa a
ghost or a live person but as i do not believ in ghost or
at ani rate that thei come back to the world on such errand i
conclud that it wa a live person still it mai have been
neither but onli a mere pictur produc befor us by the art
of zikali so much for the first question your second iswa
thi spirit or woman or shadow that of her whom i rememb
meet in zululand mani year ago king and councillor i can
onli sai that it wa veri like her still on handsom young
woman often greatli resembl anoth of the same ag and
colour further the moon give an uncertain light
especi when it is temper by smoke from a fire lastli
memori plai strang trick with all of us as you will know if
you try to think of the face of ani on who ha been dead for
more than twenti year for the rest the voic seem similar
the bead and ornament seem similar and the figur repeat
to me certain word which i thought i alon had heard come from
the lip of her who is dead also she gave me a strang messag
from anoth who is dead refer to a matter which i believ
wa known onli to me and that other yet zikali is veri clever
and mai have learn these thing in some wai unguess by me
and what he ha learn other mai have learn also king and
councillor i do not think that what we saw wa the spirit of
mameena i think it a woman not unlik to her who had been
taught her lesson i have noth more to sai and therefor i
prai you not to ask me ani further question about mameena of
whose name i grow weari
at thi point zikali seem to wake out of hi indiffer or
hi torpor for he look up and said darkli
it is strang that the cleverest ar alwai those who first fall
into the trap thei go along gaze at the star at night and
forget the pit which thei themselv have dug in the morn
ohoho ohoho
now the wrangl broke out afresh the peac parti point
triumphantli to the fact that i the white man who ought to know
put no faith in thi apparit which wa therefor without
doubt a fraud the war parti on the other hand declar that i
wa deceiv them for reason of my own on of which would be
that i did not wish to see the zulu eat up my peopl so fierc
grew the debat that i thought it would end in blow and perhap
in an attack on myself or zikali who all the while sat quit
careless and unmov stare at the moon at length cetewayo
shout for silenc spit as wa hi habit when angri
make an end he cri lest i caus some of you to grow quiet
for ever whereon the recrimin ceas open of road
he went on mani of those who ar present think like macumazahn
here that you ar but an old cheat though whether or no i be
on of these i will not sai thei demand a sign of you that none
can disput and i demand it also befor i speak the word of
peac or war give us then that sign or begon to whenc you
came and show your face no more at ulundi
what sign doe the council requir son of panda ask zikali
quietli let them agre on on togeth and tell me now at
onc for i who am old grow weari and would sleep then if it
can be given i will give it and if i cannot give it i will get
me back to my own hous and show my face no more at ulundi who
do not desir to listen again to fool who babbl like contend
water round a stone and yet never stir the stone becaus thei
run two wai at onc
now the councillor stare at each other for none knew what sign
to ask at length old sigananda said
o king it is well known that the black on who went befor you
had a certain littl assegai handl with the royal red wood
which drank the blood of mani it wa with thi assegai that
mopo hi servant who vanish from the land after the death of
dingaan let out the life of the black on at the kraal duguza
but what becam of it afterward none have heard for certain
some sai that it wa buri with the black on some that mopo
stole it other that dingaan and umhlagana burn it still a
sai rose like a wind in the land that when that spear shall
fall from heaven at the feet of the king who reign in the place
of the black on then the zulu shall make their last great war
and win a victori of which all the world shall hear now let the
open of road give us thi sign of the fall of the black
on spear and i shall be content
would you know the spear if it fell ask cetewayo
i should know it o king who have often held it in my hand
the end of the haft is gnaw for when he wa angri the black
on us to bite it also a thumb length from the blade is a
black mark made with hot iron onc the black on made a bet
with on of hi captain that at a distanc of ten pace he would
throw the spear deeper into the bodi of a chief whom he wish to
kill than the captain could the captain threw first for i saw
him with my ey and the spear sank to that place on the shaft
where the mark is for the black on burn it there then the
black on threw and the spear went through the bodi of the chief
who as he di call to him that he too should know the feel
of it in hi heart as inde he did
i think that cetewayo wa about to assent to thi suggest
sinc he who desir peac believ it imposs that zikali
should suddenli caus thi ident spear to fall from heaven
but umnyamana the prime induna interpos hurriedli
it is not enough o king zikali mai have stolen the spear for
he wa live and at the kraal duguza at that time also he mai
have put about the propheci whereof sigananda speak or at least
so men would sai let him give us a greater sign than thi that
all mai be content so that whether we make war or peac it mai
be with a singl mind now it is known that we zulu have a
guardian spirit who watch over us from the ski she who is
call nomkubulwana or by some the inkosazanayzulu the
princess of heaven it is known also that thi princess who is
white of skin and ruddyhair appear alwai befor great
thing happen in our land thu she appear befor the black
on di also she appear to a number of children befor the
battl of the tugela it is said too that but late she
appear to a woman near the coast and warn her to cross the
tugela becaus there would be war though thi woman cannot now
be found let the open of road call down nomkubulwana befor
our ey from heaven and we will admit everi man of us that
thi is a sign which cannot be question
and if he doe thi thing which i hold no doctor in the world
can do what shall it signifi ask cetewayo
o king answer umnyamana if he doe so it shall signifi
war and victori if he doe not do so it shall signifi peac
and we will bow our head befor the amalungwana basi bodw
ie the littl english us as a term of deris
do all agre ask cetewayo
we agre answer everi man stretch out hi hand
then open of road it stand thu if you can call
nomkubulwana should there be such a spirit to appear befor our
ey the council will take it as a sign that the heaven direct
us to fight the english
so spoke cetewayo and i note a tone of triumph in hi voic
for hi heart shrank from thi war and he wa certain that
zikali could do noth of the sort still the opinion of the
nation or rather of the armi wa so strong in favour of it that
he fear lest hi refus might bring about hi deposit if
not hi death from thi dilemma the supernatur test suggest
by the prime minist and approv by the council that
repres the variou tribe of peopl seem to offer a path
of escap so i read the situat as i think rightli
upon hear these word for the first time that night zikali
seem to grow disturb
what do my ear hear he exclaim excitedli am i the
umkulukulu the greatgreat ie god himself that it should
be ask of me to draw the princess of heaven from beyond the
star she who come and goe like the wind but like the wind
cannot be command do thei hear that if she will not come to
my beckon then the great zulu peopl must put a yoke upon
their shoulder and be as slave sure the king must have been
listen to the doctrin of those english teacher who wear a
white ribbon ti about their neck and tell us of a god who
suffer himself to be nail to a cross of wood rather than
make war upon hi foe on whom thei call the princ of peac
time have chang inde sinc the dai of the black on ye
gener have becom like women the captain of the impi ar
set to milk the cow well what have i to do with all thi
what doe it matter to me who am so veri old that onli my head
remain abov the level of the earth the rest of me be buri
in the grave who am not even a zulu to boot but a dwandw on
of the despis dwandw whom the zulu mock and conquer
hearken to me spirit of the hous of senzangaconaher he
address about a dozen of cetewayo ancestor by name go
back for mani gener hearken to me o princess of heaven
appoint by the greatgreat to be the guardian of the zulu race
it is ask that you should appear should it be your wish to
signifi to these your children that thei must stand upon their
feet and resist the white men who alreadi gather upon their
border and should it be your wish that thei should lai down
their spear and go home to sleep with their wive and hoe the
garden while the white men count the cattl and set each to hi
work upon the road then that you should not appear do what
you will o spirit of the hous of senzangacona do what you
will o princess of heaven what doe it matter to the
thingthatnevershouldhavebeenborn who soon will be as
though he never had been born whether the hous of senzangacona
and the zulu peopl stand or fall
i the old doctor wa summon here to give counsel i gave
counsel but it pass over the head of these wise on like a
shadow of which none took note i wa ask to prophesi of what
would chanc if war came i call the dead from their grave
thei came in voic and on of them put on the flesh again and
spoke from the lip of flesh the white man to whom she spoke
deni her who had been hi love and the wise on said that she
wa a cheat ye a doll that i had dress up to deceiv them
thi spirit that had put on flesh told of what would chanc in
the war if war there were and what would chanc to the king
but thei mock at the propheci and now thei demand a sign come
then nomkubulwana and give them the sign if you will and let
there be war or stai awai and give them no sign if you will
and let there be peac it is nought to me nought to the
thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn
thu he rambl on as it occur to me who watch and
listen talk against time for i observ that while he
spoke a cloud wa pass over the face of the moon and that
when he ceas speak it wa quit obscur by thi cloud so
that the vale of bone wa plung in a deep twilight that wa
almost dark further in a nervou kind of wai he did
someth more to hi wizard fire which again caus it to
throw out a fan of smoke that hid him and the execut rock in
front of which he sat
the cloud float by and the moon came out as though from an
eclips the smoke of the fire too thin by degre as it
melt and the light grew again i becam awar that someth
wa materi or had appear on the point of the rock abov
us a few second later to my wonder and amaz i perceiv
that thi someth wa the spiritlik form of a white woman
which stood quit still upon the veri point of the rock she wa
clad in some garment of gleam white cut low upon her breast
that mai have been of linen but from the wai it shone suggest
that it wa of glitter feather egret for instanc her
ruddi hair wa outspread and in it too someth glitter
like mica or jewel her feet and milkhu arm were bare and
pois in her right hand wa a littl spear
nor did i see alon sinc a moan of fear and worship went up
from the councillor then thei grew silent stare and stare
suddenli zikali lift hi head and look at them through the
thin flame of the fire which made hi ey shine like those of a
tiger or of a corner baboon
at what do you gaze so hard king and councillor he ask
i see noth at what then do you gaze so hard
on the rock abov you stand a white spirit in her glori it is
the inkosazana herself mutter cetewayo
ha she come then mock the old wizard nai sure it is
but a dream or anoth of my trick some black woman paint
white that i have smuggl here in my medicin bag or roll up
in the blanket on my back how can i prove to you that thi is
not anoth cheat like to that of the spirit of mameena whom the
white man her lover did not know again go near to her you
must not even if you could see that if by chanc she should
not be a cheat you would die everi man of you for woe to him
whom nomkubulwana touch how then how ah i have it
doubtless in hi pocket macumazahn yonder hide a littl gun
macumazahn who with such a gun can cut a reed in two at thirti
pace or shave the hair from the chin of a man as is well known
in the land let him then take hi littl gun and shoot at that
which you sai stand upon the rock if it be a black woman
paint white doubtless she will fall down dead as so mani have
fallen from that rock but if it be the princess of heaven then
the bullet will pass through her or turn asid and she will take
no harm though whether macumazahn will take ani harm is more
than i can sai
now when thei heard thi mani remain silent but some of the
peac parti began to clamour that i should be order to shoot at
the apparit at length cetewayo seem to give wai to thi
pressur i sai seem becaus i think he wish to give wai
whether or not a spirit stood befor him he knew no more than
the rest but he did know that unless the vision were prove to
be mortal he would be driven into war with the english
therefor he took the onli chanc that remain to him
macumazahn he said i know you have your pistol on you for
onli the other dai you brought it into my presenc and through
light and dark you nurs it as a mother doe her firstborn
now sinc the open of road desir it i command you to fire
at that which seem to stand abov us if it be a mortal woman
she is a cheat and deserv to die if it be a spirit from
heaven it can take no harm nor can you take harm who onli do
that which you must
woman or spirit i will not shoot king i answer
is it so what do you defi me white man do so if you will
but learn that then your bone shall whiten here in thi vale of
bone ye you shall be the first of the english to go below
and turn he whisper someth to two of the councillor
now i saw that i must either obei or die for a moment my mind
grew confus in face of thi aw altern i did not
believ that i saw a spirit i believ that what stood abov me
wa nomb cunningli trick out with some nativ pigment which
at that distanc and in that light made her look like a white
woman for oddli enough at that time the truth did not occur to
me perhap becaus i wa too surpris well if it were nomb
she deserv to be shot for plai such a trick and what is
more her death by reveal the fraud of zikali would perhap
avert a great war but then why did he make the suggest that
i should be command to fire at thi figur slowli i drew out
my pistol and brought it to the full cock for it wa load
i will obei king i said to save myself from be murder
but on your head be all that mai follow from thi deed
then it wa for the first time that a new idea struck me so
clearli that i believ it wa convei direct from zikali brain
to my own i might shoot but there wa no need for me to hit
after that everyth grew plain
king i said if yonder be a mortal she is about to die onli a
spirit can escap my aim watch now the centr of her forehead
for there the bullet will strike
i lift the pistol and appear to cover the figur with much
care as i did so even from that distanc i thought i saw a
look of terror in it ey then i fire with a littl jerk of
the wrist send the ball a good yard abov her head
she is unharm cri a voic macumazahn miss her
macumazahn doe not miss i repli loftili if that at which
he aim is unharm it is becaus it cannot be hit
ohoo laugh zikali the white man who doe not know the
tast of hi own love lip sai that he ha fire at that
which cannot be hit let him try again no let him choos
anoth target the spirit is the spirit but he who summon
her mai still be a cheat there is anoth bullet in your littl
gun white man see if it can pierc the heart of zikali that
the king and council mai learn whether he be a true prophet the
greatest of all the prophet that ever wa or whether he be but
a common cheat
now a sudden rage fill me against thi old rascal i
rememb how he had brought mameena to her death when he
thought that it would serv him and sinc then fill the land
with stori concern her and me which met me whatev wai i
turn i rememb that for year he had plot to bring
about the destruct of the zulu and to further hi dark end
wa now engag in caus a fear war which would cost the
live of thousand i rememb that he had trap me into
zululand and then hand me over to cetewayo separ me from
my friend who were in my charg and for aught i knew give
them to death sure the world would be well rid of him
have your will i shout and cover him with the pistol
then there came into my mind a certain sayingjudg not that ye
be not judg who and what wa i that i should dare to arraign
and pass sentenc upon thi man who after all had suffer mani
wrong as i wa about to fire i caught sight of some bright
object flash toward the king from abov and instantan
shift my aim and press the trigger the thing whatev it
might be flew in two on part of it fell upon zikali the
other part travel on and struck cetewayo upon the knee
there follow a great confus and a cry of the king is
stab i ran forward to look and saw the blade of a littl
assegai ly on the ground and on cetewayo knee a slight cut
from which blood trickl
it is noth i said a scratch no more though had not the
spear been stop in it cours it might have been otherwis
ye cri zikali but what wa it that caus the cut take
thi sigananda and tell me what it mai be and he threw
toward him a piec of red wood
sigananda look at it it is the haft of the black on
spear he exclaim which the bullet of macumazahn ha sever
from the blade
ay said zikali and the blade ha drawn the blood of the
black on child read me thi omen sigananda or ask it of
her who stand abov you
now all look to the rock but it wa empti the figur had
vanish
your word king said zikali is it for peac or war
cetewayo look at the assegai look at the blood trickl
from hi knee look at the face of the councillor
blood call for blood he moan my word iswar
chapter xvii
kaatj bring new
zikali burst into on of hi peal of laughter so unholi that
it caus the blood in me to run cold
the king word is war he cri let nomkubulwana take
that word back to heaven let macumazahn take it to the white
men let the captain cry it to the regiment and let the world
grow red the king ha chosen though mayhap had i been he i
should have chosen otherwis yet what am i but a hollow reed
stuck in the ground up which the spirit speak to men it is
finish and i too am finish for a while farewel o king
where shall we meet again i wonder on the earth or under it
farewel macumazahn i know where we shall meet though you do
not o king i return to my own place i prai you to command
that none come near me or troubl me with word for i am spent
it is command said cetewayo
as he spoke the fire went out mysteri and the wizard rose
and hobbl off at a surpris pace round the corner of the
project rock
stai i call i would speak with you but although i am
sure he heard me he did not stop or look round
i sprang up to follow him but at some sign from cetewayo two
induna bar my wai
did you not hear the king command white man on of them
ask coldli and the tone of hi question told me that war
have been declar i wa now look upon as a foe i wa
about to answer sharpli when cetewayo himself address me
macumazahn he said you ar now my enemi like all your
peopl and from sunris tomorrow morn your safeconduct here
end for if you ar found at ulundi two hour after that time
it will be law for ani man to kill you yet as you ar still
my guest i will give you an escort to the border of the land
moreov you shall take a messag from me to the queen
offic and captain it isthat i will send an answer to
their demand upon the point of an assegai yet add thi that
not i but the english to whom i have alwai been a friend
sought thi war if sompseu had suffer me to fight the boer
as i wish to do it would never have come about but he threw
the queen blanket over the transvaal and stood upon it and now
he declar that land which were alwai the properti of the
zulu belong to the boer therefor i take back all the
promis which i made to him when he came hither to call me king
in the queen name and no more do i call him my father as for
the disband of my impi let the english disband them if thei
can i have spoken
and i have heard i answer and will deliv your word
faithfulli though i hold king that thei come from the lip of
on whom the heaven have made mad
at thi bold speech some of the councillor start up with
threaten gestur cetewayo wave them back and answer
quietli perhap it wa the queen of heaven who stood on yonder
rock who made me mad or perhap she made me wise as be the
spirit of our peopl she should sure do that is a question
which the futur will decid and if ever we should meet after it
is decid we will talk it over now hamba gachl go in
peac
i hear the king and i will go but first i would speak with
zikali
then white man you must wait till thi war is finish or till
you meet him in the land of spirit goza lead macumazahn back
to hi hut and set a guard about it at the dawn a compani of
soldier will be wait with order to take him to the border
you will go with him and answer for hi safeti with your life
let him be well treat on the road as my messeng
then cetewayo rose and stood while all present gave him the royal
salut after which he walk awai down the kloof i remain
for a moment make pretenc to examin the blade of the littl
assegai that had been thrown by the figur on the rock which i
had pick from the ground thi histor piec of iron which
i have no doubt is the same that chaka alwai carri wherewith
too he is said to have kill hi mother nandi by the wai i
still possess for i slip it into my pocket and none tri to
take it from me
realli howev i wa wonder whether i could in ani wai gain
access to zikali a problem that wa settl for me by a sharp
request to move on utter in a tone which admit of no
further argument
well i trudg back to my hut in the compani of goza who wa so
overcom by all the wonder he had seen that he could scarc
speak inde when i ask him what he thought of the figur
that had appear upon the rock he repli petulantli that it
wa not given to him to know whenc spirit came or of what stuff
thei were made which show me that he at ani rate believ in
it supernatur origin and that it had appear to direct the
zulu to make war thi wa all i want to find out so i said
noth more but gave up my mind to thought of my own posit
and difficulti
here i wa order on pain of death to depart from ulundi at the
dawn and yet how could i obei without see zikali and
learn from him what had happen to anscomb and heda or at
ani rate without commun with him onc more onli did i
break silenc offer to give goza a gun if he would take a
messag from me to the great wizard but with a shake of hi big
head he answer that to do so would mean death and gun were
of no good to a dead man sinc as i had shown myself that night
thei had no power to shoot a spirit
thi close the busi on which i need not have troubl to
enter sinc an answer to all my question wa at hand
we reach the hut where goza gave me over to the guard of
soldier tell their offic that none were to be permit to
enter it save myself and that i wa not to be to permit to
come out of it until he goza came to fetch me a littl befor
the dawn
the offic ask if ani on els wa to be permit to come
out a question that surpris me though vagu for i wa
think of other thing then goza depart remark that he
hope i should sleep better than he would who felt spirit in
hi bone and did not wish to kiss them as i seem to like to
do i repli faceti think of the bottl of brandi
that er long i meant to feel them in my stomach whereat he
shook hi head again with the air of on whom noth connect
with me could surpris and vanish
i crawl into the hut and put the board over the beeholelik
entranc behind me then i began to hunt for the match in my
pocket and prick my finger with the point of chaka histor
assegai while i wa suck it to my amaz i heard the
sound of some on breath on the further side of the hut at
first i thought of call the guard but on reflect found the
match and lit the candl which stood by the blanket that
serv me as a bed as soon as it burn up i look toward the
sound and to my horror perceiv the figur of a sleep woman
which frighten me so much that i nearli drop the candl
to tell the truth so obsess wa i with zikali and hi ghost
that for a few moment it occur to me that thi might be the
shape with which i had talk an hour or two befor i mean that
which had seem to resembl the longdead ladi mameena or
rather the person made up to her like come here to continu
our convers at ani rate i wa sure and rightli that here
wa more of the handiwork of zikali who wish to put me in some
dread posit for reason of hi own
pull myself togeth i advanc upon the ladi onli to find
myself no wiser sinc she wa total cover by a kaross now
what wa to be done to escap of which of cours i had thought
at onc wa imposs sinc it meant an assegai in my rib to
call to the guard for help seem indiscreet for who knew what
those fool might sai to kick or shake her would undoubtedli be
rude and if it chanc to be the person who had plai mameena
would certainli provok remark that i should not care to face
there seem to be onli on resourc to sit down and wait till
she woke up
thi i did for quit a long time till at last the absurd of
the posit and i will admit my own curios overcam me
especi as i wa veri tire and want to go to sleep so
advanc most gingerli i turn down the kaross from over the
head of the sleep woman much wonder whom i should see for
what man is there that a veil woman doe not interest inde
doe not half the interest of woman lie in the fact that her
natur is veil from man in short a mysteri which he is alwai
seek to solv at hi peril and i might add never succe in
solv
well i turn down that kaross and next instant step back
amaz and to tell the truth somewhat disappoint for there
with her mouth open lai no wondrou and spiritu mameena but
the stout earthli and most prosaickaatj
confound the woman thought i to myself what is she do
here
then i rememb how wrong it wa to give wai to a sens of
romant disappoint at such a time though as a matter of
fact it is alwai in a moment of crisi or of strain nerv
that we ar most open to the insidi advanc of romanc also
that there wa no on on earth or beyond it whom i ought more
greatli to have rejoic to see i had left kaatj with anscomb
and heda therefor kaatj could tell me what had becom of them
and at thi thought my heart sankwhi wa she here in thi most
inappropri meetingplac alon feel that these were
question which must be answer at onc i prod kaatj in the
rib with my toe until after a good deal of prod she awok
sat up and yawn reveal an excel set of teeth in her
cavern quartercast mouth then perceiv a man she open
that mouth even wider as i thought with the idea of scream
for help but here i wa first with her for befor a sound
could issu i had fill it full with the corner of the kaross
exclaim in dutch as i did so
idiot of a woman do you not know the heer quatermain when you
see him
oh baa she answer i thought you were some wick zulu
come to do me a mischief then she burst into tear and sob
which i could not stop for at least three minut
be quiet you fat fool i cri exasper and tell me
where ar your mistress and the heer anscomb
i dont know baa but i hope in heaven kaatj wa some kind
of a christian she repli between her sob
in heaven what do you mean i ask horrifi
i mean baa that i hope thei ar in heaven becaus when last
i saw them thei were both dead and dead peopl must be either in
heaven or hell and heaven thei sai is better than hell
dead where did you see them dead
in that black kloof baa some dai after you left us and went
awai the old baboon man who is call zikali gave us leav
through the witchgirl nomb to go also so the baa anscomb
set to work to inspan the hors the missi heda help him
while i pack the thing when i had nearli finish nomb
came smile like a cat that ha caught two mice and beckon
to me to follow her i went and saw the cart inspan with the
four hors all look as though thei were asleep for their
head hung down then after she had stare at me for a long
while nomb led me past the hors into the shadow of the
overhang cliff there i saw my mistress and the baa anscomb
ly side by side quit dead
how do you know that thei were dead i gasp what had
kill them
i know that thei were dead becaus thei were dead baa
their mouth and ey were open and thei lai upon their back
with their arm stretch out the witchgirl nomb said some
kaffir had come and strangl them and then gone awai again or
so i understood who cannot speak zulu so veri well who the
kaffir were or why thei came she did not sai
then what did you do i ask
i ran back to the hut baa fear lest i should be strangl
also and wept there till i grew hungri when i came out of it
again thei were gone nomb show me a place under a tree where
the earth wa disturb she said that thei were buri there by
order of her master zikali i dont know what becam of the
hors or the cart
and what happen to you afterward
baa i wa kept for sever dai i cannot rememb how mani
and onli allow out within the fenc round the hut nomb came
to see me onc bring thi and she produc a packag sewn
up in a skin she said that i wa to give it to you with a
messag that those whom you love were quit safe with on who is
greater than ani in the land and therefor that you must not
griev for them whose troubl were over i think it wa two
night after thi that four zulu came two men and two women
and led me awai as i thought to kill me but thei did not kill
me inde thei were veri kind to me although when i spoke to
them thei pretend not to understand thei took me a long
journei travel for the most part in the dark and sleep in
the dai thi even when the sun set thei brought me through a
kaffir town and thrust me into the hut where i am without
speak to ani on here be veri tire i went to sleep
and that is all
and quit enough too thought i to myself then i put her
through a crossexamin but kaatj wa a stupid woman
although a good and faith servant and all her terribl
experi had not sharpen her intellig inde when i
press her she grew utterli confus began to cry therebi
take refug in the last impregn femal fortif and
snivel out that she could not bear to talk of her dear
mistress ani more so i gave it up and two minut later she
wa liter snore be veri tire poor thing
now i tri to think matter out as well as thi disturb
would allow for noth hinder thought so much as snore but
what wa the us of think there wa her stori to take or to
leav and evid the honest creatur believ what she said
further how could she be deceiv on such a point she swore
that she had seen anscomb and heda dead and afterward had seen
their grave
moreov there wa confirm in nomb messag which could
not well have been invent that spoke of their be well in
the charg of a great on a term by which the zulu design
god with all their troubl finish the reason and manner of
their end were left unrev zikali might have murder them
for hi own purpos or the zulu might have kill them in
obedi to the king order that no white peopl in the land
were to be allow to live or perhap the basuto from
sekukuni countri with whom the zulu had some understand
had follow and done them to death inde the strangl
sound more basuto than zuluif thei were realli strangl
almost overcom though i wa i bethought me of the packag and
open it onli to find anoth appar proof of their end for
it contain heda jewel as i had found them in the bag in the
safe also a spare gold watch belong to anscomb with hi
coatofarm engrav upon it that which he wore wa of silver
and no doubt wa buri with him sinc for superstiti reason
the nativ would not have touch anyth on hi person after
death thi seem to me to settl the matter presumpt at
ani rate sinc to show that robberi wa not the caus of their
murder their most valuabl possess which were not upon their
person had been sent to me their friend
so thi wa the end of all my effort to secur the safeti and
wellb of that most unlucki pair i wept when i thought of
it there in the dark of the hut for the candl had burn
out and go on to my knee put up an earnest prayer for the
welfar of their soul also that i might be forgiven my folli in
lead them into such danger and yet i did it for the best
try to judg wise in the light of such experi of the
world as i possess
now ala when i am old i have come to the conclus that those
thing which on tri to do for the best on gener doe
wrong becaus nearli alwai there is some tricki fate at hand to
mar them which in thi instanc wa name zikali the fact is
i suppos that man who think himself a free agent can scarc
be thu call at ani rate so far as immedi result ar
concern but that is a danger doctrin about which i will
sai no more for i daresai that he is engag in weav a great
lifepattern of which he onli see the tiniest piec
on thing comfort me a littl if these two were dead i could
now leav zululand without qualm of cours i wa oblig to
leav in ani case or die but somehow that fact would not have
eas my conscienc inde i think that had i believ thei
still live in thi wai or in that i should have tri not to
leav becaus i should have thought it for the best to stai to
help them wherebi in all human probabl i should have brought
about my own death without help them at all well it had
fallen out otherwis and there wa an end now i could onli hope
that thei had gone to some place where there ar no more
troubl even if at the worst it were a place of rest too deep
for dream
muse thu at last i doze off for i wa so tire that i think
i should have slept although execut await me at the dawn
instead of anoth journei i did not sleep well becaus of that
snore femal on the other side of the hut whose presenc
outrag my sens of proprieti and caus me to be invad by
prophet dream of the talk that would ensu among those
scandalmong zulu ye it wa of thi i dream not of
the great danger that threaten me or of the terribl loss of
my friend perhap becaus to mani men of whom i suppos i am
on the fear of scandal or of be the object of public notic
is more than the fear of danger or the smart of sorrow
so the night wore awai till at length i woke to see the gleam of
dawn penetr the smokehol and dimli illumin the
recumb form of kaatj which to me look most unattract
present i heard a discreet tap on the doorboard of the hut
which i at onc remov wriggl swiftli through the hole
careless in my miseri as to whether i met an assegai the other
side of it or not without a guard of eight soldier wa
stand and with them goza who ask me if i were readi to
start
quit i answer as soon as i have saddl my hors which
by the wai had been led up to the hut
veri soon thi wa done for i brought out most of my few
belong with me and the bag of jewel wa in my pocket then
it wa that the offic of the guard a thin and
melancholylook person said in a hollow voic address
himself to goza
the order ar that the white man wife is to go with him
where is she
where a man wife should be in hi hut i suppos answer
goza sleepili
rage fill me at the word seldom do i rememb be so
angri
ye i said if you mean that halfcast whom someon ha
thrust upon me she is in there so if she is to come with us
perhap you will get her out
thu adjur the melancholylook captain who wa name
indudu perhap becaus he or hi father had long to the dudu
regiment crawl into the hut whenc present emerg sound
not unlik those which onc i heard when a ringhal cobra
follow a hare that i had wound into a hole a muffl sound
of struggl and terror these end in the sudden and violent
appear of kaatj fat and dishevel form follow by that
of the snakelik indudu
see me stand there befor a bevi of arm zulu she
promptli fell upon my neck with a cry for help for the silli
woman thought she wa go to be kill by them grip me as
an octopu grip it prei she proceed to faint drag me to
my knee beneath the weight of eleven stone of solid flesh
ah said on of the zulu not unkindli she is much afraid for
her husband whom she love
well i disentangl myself somehow and seiz what i took to
be a gourd of water in that dim light pour it over her head
onli to discov too late that it wa not water but clot milk
howev the result wa the same for present she sat up made a
dreadfullook object by thi liber applic of curd and
whei whereon i explain matter to her to the best of my power
the end of it wa that after indudu and goza had wipe her down
with tuft of thatch drag from the hut and i had collect her
gear with the rest of my own we set her on the hors
straddlewis and start the object of much interest among
such zulu as were alreadi abroad
at the gate of the town there wa a delai which made me nervou
sinc in such a case as mine delai might alwai mean a
deathwarr i knew that it wa quit possibl cetewayo had
chang or been persuad to chang hi mind and issu a command
that i should be kill as on who had seen and knew too much
inde thi fear wa my constant companion dure all the long
journei to the drift of the tugela caus me to look askanc at
everi man we met or who overtook us lest he should prove to be a
messeng of doom
nor were these doubt groundless for as i learn in the after
dai the prime minist umnyamana and other had urg
cetewayo strongli to kill me and what we were wait for at the
gate were hi final order on the subject howev in thi
matter as in more that i could mention the king plai the part
of a man of honour and although he seem to hesit for
reason of polici never had ani intent of allow me to be
harm on the contrari the command brought wa that ani on who
harm macumazahn the king guest and messeng should die
with all hi hous
whilst we tarri a number of women gather round us whose
convers i could not help overhear on of them said to
anoth
look at the white man watcherbynight who can knock a fly off
an ox horn with a bullet from further awai than we could see
it he it wa who love and wa love by the witch mameena
whose beauti is still famou in the land thei sai she kill
herself for hi sake becaus she declar that she would never
live to grow old and ugli so that he turn awai from her my
mother told me all about it onli last night
then you have a liar for a mother thought i to myself for to
contradict such a on openli would have been undignifi
is it so ask on of her friend deepli interest then
the ladi mameena must have had a strang tast in men for thi
on is an ugli littl fellow with hair like the grei ash of
stubbl and a wrinkl face of the colour of a flai skin that
ha lain unstretch in the sun howev i have been told that
witch alwai love those who look unnatur
ye said number on but you see now that he is old he ha to
be satisfi with a differ sort of wife she is not
beauti is she although she ha dip her head in milk to
make herself look white
so it went on till at length a runner arriv and whisper
someth to indudu who salut show me that it wa a royal
messag and order us to move of thi i wa glad for had i
stop there much longer i think i should have person
assault those gossip femal idiot
of our journei through zululand there is noth particular to
sai we saw but few peopl sinc most of the men had been
call up to the armi and mani of the kraal seem to be
desert by the women and children who perhap were hidden awai
with the cattl onc howev we met an impi about five
thousand strong that seem to cover the hillsid like a herd of
game it consist of the nodwengu and the nokenk regiment
both of which afterward fought at isandhlwana some of their
captain with a small guard came to see who we were fine
fiercelook men thei stare at me curious and with on of
them whom i knew i had a littl talk he said that i wa the
last white man in zululand and that i wa lucki to be aliv for
soon these and he point to the hord of warrior who were
stream past would eat up the english to the last bone i
answer that thi remain to be seen as the english were also
great eater whereat he laugh repli that it wa true that
the white men had alreadi taken the first bitea veri littl
on from which i gather that some small engag had
happen
well farewel macumazahn he said as he turn to go i
hope that we shall meet in the battl for i want to see if you
can run as well as you can shoot
thi rous my temper and i answer him
i hope for your sake that we shall not meet for if we do i
promis that befor i run i will show you what you never saw
befor the gatewai of the world of spirit
i mention thi convers becaus by some strang chanc it
happen at isandhlwana that i kill thi man who wa name
simpofu
dure all those dai of trudg through hot sun and
thunderstorm for i had to give up the mare to kaatj who wa
too fat to walk or said she wa i wa liter haunt by
thought of my murder friend heaven know how bitterli i
reproach myself for have brought them into zululand it
seem so terribl sad that these young peopl who love each
other and had so bright a futur befor them should have escap
from a tragic past mere to be overwhelm by such a fate
again and again i question that lump kaatj as to the detail
of their end and of all that went befor and follow after the
murder
but it wa quit useless inde as time went on she seem to
becom more nebul on the point as though a pictur were fade
from her mind but as to on thing she wa alwai quit clear
that she had seen them dead and had seen their newmad grave
thi she swore by god in heaven complet the oath with an
outburst of tear in a wai that would have carri convict to
ani juri as it did to me
and after all what wa more like in the circumst zikali
had kill them or caus them to be kill or possibl thei
were kill in spite of him in obedi to the express or
gener order of the king if the deed wa not done by the
basuto and yet an idea occur to me how about the woman on
the rock that the zulu thought wa their princess of the
heaven obvious thi must be nonsens sinc no such deiti
exist therefor the person must either have been a white woman
or on paint up to resembl a white woman seen from a distanc
in moonlight it wa imposs to sai which now if it were a
white woman she might from her shape and height and the colour
of her hair be heda herself yet it seem incred that
heda whom kaatj had seen dead some dai befor could be
masquerad in such a part and make no sign of recognit to
me even when i cover her with my pistol wherea that nomb
would plai it wa like enough
onli then nomb must be someth of a quickchang artist sinc
but a littl while befor she wa beyond doubt person the
dead mameena if it were not so i must have been suffer from
illus for certainli i seem to see some on who look like
mameena and onli zikali and through him nomb had suffici
knowledg to enabl her to fill that role with such success
perhap the whole busi wa an illus though if so zikali
power must be great inde but then how about the assegai that
nomkubulwana or rather her effigi had seem to hold and throw
whereof the blade wa at present in my saddlebag that at ani
rate wa tangibl and real though of cours there wa noth to
prove that it had realli been chaka famou weapon
anoth thing that torment me wa my failur to see zikali i
felt as though i had commit a crime in leav zululand
without do thi and hear from hi own lipswel whatev
he chose to tell me i forget if i said that while we were
wait at the gate where those silli women talk so much
nonsens about mameena and kaatj that i made anoth effort
through goza to get into touch with the wizard but quit without
avail goza onli answer what he said befor that if i wish
to die at onc i had better take ten step toward the vallei of
bone whenc he ad parenthet the open of road had
alreadi depart on hi homeward journei thi might or might
not be true at ani rate i could find no possibl wai of come
face to face with him or even of get a messag to hi ear
no i wa not to blame i had done all i could and yet in my
heart i felt guilti but then as cynic would sai failur is
guilt
at length we came to the ford of the tugela and as fortun
the water wa just low enough bade farewel to our escort befor
cross to the natal side my part with goza wa quit
touch for we felt that it partook of the natur of a deathb
adieu which inde it did i told him and the other that i
hope their end be easi and that whether thei met them by
bullet or by bayonet thrust the wound would prove quickli

chapter xviii
isandhlwana
we had cross the tugela by what is known as the middl drift
a mile or so on the further side of it i wa challeng by a
young fellow in charg of some mount nativ and found that i
had stumbl into what wa known as no 2 column which consist
of a rocket batteri three battalion of the nativ conting
and some troop of mount nativ all under the command of
colonel durnford re
after explan i wa taken to thi offic headquart
tent he wa a tall nervouslook man with a fair handsom
face and long sidewhisk on of hi arm i rememb wa
support by a sling i think it had been injur in some kaffir
fight when i wa introduc to him he wa veri busi have
i understood from some on on hi staff just receiv order to
oper against matshana
learn that i had come from zululand and wa acquaint with
the zulu he at onc began to crossexamin me about matshana a
chief of whom he seem to know veri littl inde i told him
what i could which wa not much and befor i could give him ani
inform of real import wa shown out and most hospit
entertain at luncheon a meal of which i partook with gratitud
in some garment that i had borrow from on of the offic
while my own were set in the sun to dry well can i recal how
much i enjoi the first whiski and soda that i had tast sinc
i left the templ and the good english food by which it wa
accompani
present i rememb kaatj whom i had left outsid with some
nativ women and went to see what had happen to her i found
her finish a hearti meal and engag in convers with a
young gentleman who wa write in a notebook afterward i
discov that he wa a newspap correspond what she told
him and what he imagin i do not know but i mai as well state
the result at onc within a few dai there appear in on of
the natal paper and for aught i know all over the earth an
announc that mr allan quatermain a wellknown hunter in
zululand after mani adventur had escap from that countri
togeth with hi favourit nativ wife the onli survivor of
hi extens domest establish then follow some wild
detail as to the murder of my other wive by a zulu wizard
call road mender or sick ass ie open of road or
zikali and so on
i wa furiou and interview the editor a mild and apologet
littl man who assur me that the despatch wa print exactli
as it had been receiv as though that better the case after
thi i commenc an action for libel but as i wa absent through
circumst over which i had no control when it came on for
trial the case wa dismiss i suppos the truth wa that thei
mix me up with a certain wellknown white man in zululand who
had a larg domest establish but howev thi mai be it
wa a long while befor i heard the last of that favourit
nativ wife
later in the dai i and kaatj who stuck to me like a burr
depart from the camp
the rest of our journei wa unev except for more
misunderstand about kaatj on of which wherein a clergyman
wa concern wa too pain to relat at last we reach
maritzburg where i deposit kaatj in a boardinghous kept by
anoth halfcast and with a sigh of relief betook myself to the
plough hotel which wa a long wai off her
subsequ she obtain a place as a cook at howick and for a
while i saw her no more
at maritzburg as in duti bound i call upon variou person in
author and deliv cetewayo messag leav out all
zikali witchcraft which would have sound absurd it did not
produc much impress as hostil have alreadi occur
it wa superflu also no on wa inclin to pai attent to
the word of on who wa neither an offici nor a militari
offic but a mere hunter suppos to have brought a nativ wife
out of zululand
i did howev report the murder of anscomb and heda though in
such time thi caus no excit especi as thei were not
known to the offici concern with such matter inde the
occurr never so much as got into the paper ani more than
did the death of rodd and marnham on the border of sekukuni
countri when peopl ar expect to be massacr themselv
thei do not troubl about the past kill of other far awai
lastli i post marnham will to the pretoria bank advis
them that thei had better keep it safe until some claim aros
and deposit heda jewel and valuabl in anoth branch of
the same bank in maritzburg with a seal statement as to how
thei came into my possess
these thing done i found it necessari to turn myself to the
etern problem of earn my live i am a veri rich man now
as i write these reminisc here in yorkshirek solomon
mine made me thatbut up to the time of my journei to kukuana
land with my friend curti and good although plenti of monei
pass through my hand on on occas and anoth littl of it
ever seem to stick in thi wai or that it wa lost or melt
also i wa not born on to make the best of hi opportun in
the wai of acquir wealth perhap thi wa good for me sinc
if i had gain the cash earli i should not have met with the
experi and dure our few transitori year experi is
of more real valu than cash it mai prepar us for other thing
beyond wherea the mere possess of a bank balanc can prepar
us for noth in a land where gold ceas to be an object of
worship as it is here yet wealth is our god not knowledg or
wisdom a fact which show that the real essenc of christian
ha not yet permeat human moral it just run over their
surfac no more and for everi ey that is turn toward the
divin vision a thousand ar fix night and dai upon mammon
glitter imag
now i own certain wagon and oxen and just then the demand for
these wa keen so i hire them out to the militari author
for servic in the war and incident myself with them i
drove what i consid a splendid bargain with an offic who
wrote as mani letter after hi name as a governorgener but
wa realli someth quit humbl at least i thought it
splendid until outsid hi tent i met a certain transport rider
of my acquaint whom i had alwai look upon as a perfect
fool who told me that not half an hour befor he had got twenti
per cent more for unsalt oxen and veri ricketi wagon
howev it did not matter much in the end as the whole outfit
wa lost at isandhlwana and ow to the lack of some formal
which i had overlook i never recov more than a tith of
their valu i think it wa that i neglect to claim within a
certain specifi time
at last my wagon were laden with ammunit and other govern
good and i trek over aw road to helpmakaar a place on
the highland not far from rork drift where no 3 column wa
station here we were delai awhil i and my wagon have
move to a ford of the buffalo togeth with mani other it
wa dure thi time that i ventur to make veri urgent
represent to certain highli place offic i will not
mention which as to the necess of laager that is form
fortifi camp as soon as zululand wa enter sinc from my
intim knowledg of it peopl i wa sure that thei would
attack in forc these warn of mine were receiv with the
most perfect polit and offer of gin to drink which all
transport rider were suppos to love but in effect were
treat with the contempt that thei were held to deserv the
subject is pain and on on which i will not dwell why should
i complain when i know that caution from notabl person such as
sir melmoth osborn and j j ui a member of on the old dutch
fight famili met with a like fate
by the wai it wa while i wa wait on the bank of the river
that i came across an old friend of mine a zulu name magepa
with whom i had fought at the battl of the tugela a few dai
later thi man perform an extraordinari feat in save hi
grandchild from death by hi great swift in run whereof
i have preserv a note somewher or other
ultim on januari 11 we receiv our march order and
cross the river by the drift the gener scheme of the
campaign be that the variou column were to converg upon
ulundi the road if so thei can be call were in such a
fear state that it took us ten dai to cover as mani mile
at length we trek over a stoni nek about five hundr yard in
width to the right of us wa a stoni emin and to our left
it sheer brown cliff of rock rise like the wall of some
cyclopean fortress the strang abrupt mount of isandhlwana
which remind me of a huge lion crouch abov the
hillencircl plain beyond at the foot of thi isol mount
whereof the aspect somehow fill me with alarm we camp on the
night of januari 21 take no precaut against attack by wai
of laager the wagon inde the last thing that seem to
occur to those in command wa that there would be seriou
fight men march forward to their death as though thei were
go on a shootingparti or to a picnic i even saw cricket
bat and wicket occupi some of the scanti space upon the
wagon
now i am not go to set out all the militari detail that
preced the massacr of isandhlwana for these ar written in
histori it is enough to sai that on the night of januari 21
major dartnel who wa in command of the natal mount polic
and had been sent out to reconnoitr the countri beyond
isandhlwana report a strong forc of zulu in front of us
thereon lord chelmsford the generalinchief move out from the
camp at dawn to hi support take with him six compani of the
24th regiment togeth with four gun and the mount infantri
there were left in the camp two gun and about eight hundr
white and nine hundr nativ troop also some transport rider
such as myself and a number of miscellan campfollow i
saw him go from between the curtain of on of my wagon where i
had made my bed on the top of a pile of baggag inde i had
alreadi dress myself at the time for that night i slept veri
ill becaus i knew our danger and my heart wa heavi with fear
about ten oclock in the morn colonel durnford whom i have
mention alreadi rode up with five hundr natal zulu about
half of whom were mount and two rocket tube which of cours
were work by white men thi wa after a patrol had report
that thei had come into touch with some zulu on the left front
who retir befor them as a matter of fact these zulu were
forag in the meali field sinc ow to the drought food
wa veri scarc in zululand that year and the regiment were
hungri i happen to see the meet between colonel pullein
a short stout man who wa then in command of the camp and
colonel durnford who as hi senior offic took it over from
him and heard colonel pullein sai that hi order were to
defend the camp but what els pass between them i do not
know
present colonel durnford saw and recogn me
do you think the zulu will attack us mr quatermain he said
i dont think so sir i answer as it is the dai of the new
moon which thei hold unlucki but tomorrow it mai be
differ
then he gave certain order dispatch captain georg shepston
with a bodi of mount nativ along the ridg to the left where
present thei came in contact with the zulu about three mile
awai and make other disposit a littl later he move out
to the front with a strong escort follow by the rocket
batteri which ultim advanc to a small conic hill on the
left front round which it pass never to return again
just befor he start colonel durnford see me still stand
there ask me if i would like to accompani him ad that as
i knew the zulu so well i might be us i answer
certainli and call to my head driver a man name jan to
bring me my mare the same that i had ridden out of zululand
while i slip into the wagon and in addit to the belt
that i wore fill all my avail pocket with cartridg for
my doublebarrel express rifl
as i mount i gave jan certain direct about the wagon and
oxen to which he listen and then to my astonish held out
hi hand to me sai
goodby baa you have been a kind master to me and i thank
you
why do you sai that i ask
becaus baa all the kaffir declar that the great zulu impi
will be on to us in an hour or two and eat up everi man i cant
tell how thei know it but so thei swear
nonsens i answer it is the dai of new moon when the zulu
dont fight still if anyth of the sort should happen you
and the other boi had better slip awai to natal sinc the
govern must pai for the wagon and oxen
thi i said half joke but it wa a lucki jest for jan and the
rest of my servant sinc thei interpret it in earnest and
with the except of on of them who went back to get a gun got
off befor the zulu horn close round the camp and cross the
river in safeti
next moment i wa canter awai after colonel durnford whom i
caught up about a quarter of a mile from the camp
now of cours i did not see all of the terribl battl that
follow and can onli tell of that part of it in which i had a
share colonel durnford rode out about three and a half mile to
the left front i realli dont quit know why for alreadi we
were hear fire on the top of the nqutu hill almost behind
us where captain shepston wa engag the zulu or so i
believ suddenli we met a trooper of the natal carabin
whose name wa whitelaw who had been out scout he report
that an enorm impi wa just ahead of us seat in an umkumbi
or semicircl as is the fashion of the zulu befor thei
charg at least some of them he said were so seat but
other were alreadi advanc
present these appear over the crest of the hill ten thousand
of them i should sai and amongst them i recogn the shield
of the nodwengu the dududu the nokenk and the ingobamakosi
regiment now there wa noth to be done except retreat for
the impi wa attack in earnest the gener untshingwayo
togeth with undabuko cetewayo brother and the chief usibebu
who command the scout had agre not to fight thi dai for
the reason i have given becaus it wa that of the new moon but
circumst had forc their hand and the regiment could no
longer be restrain so to the number of twenti thousand or
more sai onethird of the total zulu armi thei hurl
themselv upon the littl english forc that ow to lack of
generalship wa scatter here and there over a wide front and
had no fortifi base upon which to withdraw
we fell back to a donga which we held for a littl while and
then as we saw that there we should present be overwhelm
withdrew gradual for anoth two mile or so keep off the
zulu by our fire in so do we came upon the remain of the
rocket batteri near the foot of the conic hill i have
mention which had been destroi by some regiment that pass
behind us in it rush on the camp there lai all the soldier
dead assegai through and through and i notic that on young
fellow who had been shot through the head still held a rocket in
hi hand
now somewhat behind and perhap half a mile to the right of thi
hill a long shallow donga run across the isandhlwana plain
thi we gain and be there reinforc by about fifti of the
natal carabin under captain bradstreet held it for a long
while keep off the zulu by our terribl fire which cut down
score of them everi time thei attempt to advanc at thi
spot i alon kill from twelv to fifteen of them for if the
big bullet from my express rifl struck a man he did not live
messeng were sent back to the camp for more ammunit but
none arriv heaven know why my own belief is that the
reserv cartridg were pack awai in box and could not be got
at at last our suppli began to run short so there wa noth
to be done except retreat upon the camp which wa perhap half a
mile behind us
take advantag of a paus in the zulu advanc which had lain
down while wait for reserv colonel durnford order a
retir that wa carri out veri well up to that time we
had lost onli quit a few men for the zulu fire wa wild and
high and thei had not been abl to get at us with the assegai
as we rode toward the mount i observ that fire wa go on
in all direct especi on the nek that connect it with
the nqutu rang where captain shepston and hi mount basuto
were wipe out while try to hold back the zulu right horn
the gun too were fire heavili and do great execut
after thi all grew confus colonel durnford gave order to
certain offic who came up to him captain essex wa on and
lieuten cochran anoth then hi forc made for their
wagon to get more ammunit i kept near to the colonel and a
while later found myself with him and a larg mix bodi of men
a littl to the right of the nek which we had cross in our
advanc from the river not long afterward there wa a cry of
the zulu ar get round us and look to the left i saw
them pour in hundr across the ridg that join isandhlwana
mountain to the nqutu rang also thei were advanc straight
on to the camp
then the rout began alreadi the nativ auxiliari were
slip awai and now the other follow of cours thi battl
wa but a small affair yet i think that few have been more
terribl at ani rate in modern time the aspect of those
plume and shield zulu as thei charg shout their
warcri and wave their spear wa awesom thei were mown
down in hundr by the martini fire but still thei came on and
i knew that the game wa up a madden hord of fugit
mostli nativ began to flow past us over the nek make for
what wa afterward call fugit drift nine mile awai and
with them went white soldier some mount some on foot
mingl with all these peopl follow them on either side of
them rush zulu stab as thei ran other group of
soldier form themselv into rough squar on which the
savag warrior broke like water on a rock by degre ammunit
ran out onli the bayonet remain still the zulu could not
break those squar so thei took anoth counsel withdraw
a few pace beyond the reach of the bayonet thei overwhelm
the soldier by throw assegai then rush in and finish
them
thi wa what happen to us among whom were men of the 24th
natal carabin and mount polic some had dismount but i
sat on my hors which stood quit still i think from fright
and fire awai so long as i had ani ammunit with my veri
last cartridg i kill the captain indudu who had been in charg
of the escort that conduct me to the tugela he had caught
sight of me and call out
now macumazahn i will cut you up nice as i promis
he got no further in hi speech for at that moment i sent an
express bullet through him and hi tall melancholi figur
doubl up and collaps
all thi while colonel durnford had been behav as a british
offic should do scorn to attempt flight whenev i look
round i caught sight of hi tall form easi to recogn by the
long fair moustach and hi arm in a sling move to and fro
encourag us to stand firm and die like men then suddenli i
saw a kaffir who carri a big old smoothbor gun aim at him
from a distanc of about twenti yard and fire he went down
as i believ dead and that wa the end of a veri gallant offic
and gentleman whose militari memori ha in my opinion been most
unjustli attack the real blame for that disast doe not
rest upon the shoulder of either colonel durnford or colonel
pullein
after thi thing grew veri aw some fled but the most stood
and di where thei were oddli enough dure all thi time i
wa never touch men fell to my right and left and in front of
me bullet and assegai whizz past me yet i remain quit
unhurt it wa as though some power protect me which no doubt
it did
at length when nearli all had fallen and i had noth left to
defend myself with except my revolv i made up my mind that it
wa time to go my first impuls wa to ride for the river nine
mile awai look behind me i saw that the rough road wa full
of zulu hunt down those who tri to escap still i thought
i would try it when suddenli there flash across my brain the
sai of whoever it wa that person mameena in the vallei of
bone to the effect that in the great rout of the battl i wa
not to join the fly but to set my face toward ulundi and that
if i did so i should be protect and no harm would come to me
i knew that all thi propheci wa but a vain thing fondli
imagin although it wa true that the battl and the rout had
come and yet i act on itwhi heaven know alon
set the spur to my hors i gallop off past isandhlwana
mount on the southern slope of which a bodi of the 24th were
still fight their last fight and head for the nqutu rang
the plain wa full of zulu reserv run up also to the
right of me the ulundi and gikazi divis were stream
forward these or some of them form the left horn of the
impi but ow to the unprepar natur of the zulu battl for
it must alwai be rememb that thei did not mean to fight that
dai their advanc had been delai until it wa too late for
them entir to enclos the camp thu the road if it can so
be call to fugit drift wa left open for a while and by
it some effect their escap it wa thi horn or part of it
that afterward move on and attack rork drift with result
disastr to itself
for some hundr of yard i rode on thu recklessli becaus
reckless seem my onli chanc thrice i met bodi of
zulu but on each occas thei scatter befor me call out
word that i could not catch it wa as though thei were
frighten of someth thei saw about me perhap thei thought
that i wa mad to ride thu among them inde i must have
look mad or perhap there wa someth els at ani rate i
believ that i wa go to win right through them when an
accid happen
a bullet struck my mare somewher in the back i dont know
where it came from but as i saw no zulu shoot i think it must
have been on fire by a soldier who wa still fight on the
slope of the mount the effect of it wa to make the poor beast
quit ungovern round she wheel and gallop at headlong
speed back toward the peak leap over dead and dy and
break through the live as she went in two minut we were
rush up it northern flank which seem to be quit
unten toward the sheer brown cliff which rose abov it
for the fight wa in progress on the other side suddenli at
the foot of thi cliff the mare stop shiver and sank down
dead probabl from intern bleed
i look about me desper to attempt the plain on foot
meant death what then wa i to do glanc at the cliff i saw
that there wa a gulli in it worn by thousand of year of
rainfal in which grew scanti bush into thi i ran and
find it practic though difficult began to climb upward
quit unnot by the zulu who were all emploi upon the
further side the end of it wa that i reach the veri crest of
the mount a patch of bare brown rock except at on spot on it
southern front where there wa a littl hollow in which at thi
raini season of the year herbag and fern grew in the
accumul soil also a few stunt aloelik plant
into thi patch i crept have first slake my thirst from a
littl pool of rain water that lai in a cuplik depress of
the rock which tast more delici than ani nectar and seem
to give me new life then cover myself as well as i could
with grass and dri leav from the alo plant i lai still
now i wa right on the brink of the cliff and had the best view
of the isandhlwana plain and the surround countri that can be
imagin from my lofti eyri some hundr of feet in the air
i could see everyth that happen beneath thu i wit
the destruct of the last of the soldier on the slope below
thei made a gallant end so gallant that i wa proud to be of the
same blood with them on fine young fellow escap up the peak
and reach a plateau about fifti feet beneath me he wa
follow by a number of zulu but took refug in a littl cave
whenc he shot three or four of them then hi cartridg were
exhaust and i heard the savag speak in prais of
himdead i think he wa the last to die on the field of
isandhlwana
the loot of the camp began it wa a terribl scene the oxen
and those of the hors that could be caught were driven awai
except certain of the former which were har to the gun and
some of the wagon and as i afterward learn taken to ulundi
in proof of victori then the slain were strip and kaffir
appear wear the red coat of the soldier and carri their
rifl the store were broken into and all the spirit drunk
even the medic drug were swallow by these ignor men with
the result that i saw some of them reel about in agoni and
other fall down and go to sleep
an hour or two later an offic who came from the direct in
which the gener had march canter right into the camp where
the tent were still stand and even the flag wa fly i
long to be abl to warn him but could not he rode up to the
headquart marque whenc suddenli issu a zulu wave a
great spear i saw the offic pull up hi hors remain for a
moment as though indecis then turn and gallop madli awai
quit unharm though on or two assegai were thrown and mani
shot fire at him after thi consider movement of the
zulu went on of which the net result wa that thei evacu
the place
now i hope that i might escap but it wa not to be sinc on
everi side number of them crept up isandhlwana mountain and hid
behind rock or among the tall grass evid for purpos of
observ moreov some captain arriv on the littl
plateau where wa the cave in which the soldier had been kill
and camp there at least at sundown thei unrol their mat
and at though thei light no fire
the dark fell and in it escap for me from that guard place
wa imposs sinc i could not see where to set my feet and
on fals step on the steep rock would have meant my death from
the direct of rork drift i could hear continu fire
evid some great fight wa go on there i wonder
vaguelywith what result a littl later also i heard the
distant tramp of hors and the roll of gun wheel the captain
below heard it too and said on to anoth that it wa the
english soldier return who had march out of the camp at
dawn thei debat on with anoth whether it would be possibl
to collect a forc to fall upon them but abandon the idea
becaus the regiment who had fought that dai were now at a
distanc and too tire and the other had rush forward with
order to attack the white men on and beyond the river
so thei lai still and listen and i too lai still and listen
for on that cloudi moonless night i could see noth i heard
smother word of command i heard the forc halt becaus it
could not travel further in the gloom then thei lai down the
live among the dead wonder doubtless if thei themselv
would not soon be dead as of cours must have happen had the
zulu generalship been better for if even five thousand men had
been avail to attack at dawn not on of them could have
escap but provid ordain it otherwis some were taken
and the other left
about an hour befor daylight i heard them stir again and
when it first gleam came all of them had vanish over the nek
of slaughter with what thought in their heart i wonder and
to what fate the captain on the plateau beneath had gone also
and so had the circl of guard upon the slope of the mount for
i saw these depart through the grei mist as the light gather
howev i observ bodi of men collect on the nek or
rather on both nek which made it imposs for me to do what i
had hope and run to overtak the english troop from these i
wa utterli cut off nor could i remain longer without food on
my point of rock especi as i wa sure that soon some zulu
would climb there to us it as an outlook post so while i wa
still more or less hidden by the mist and morn shadow i
climb down it by the same road that i had climb up and thu
reach the plain not a live man white or black wa to be
seen onli the dead onli the dead i wa the last englishman to
stand upon the plain of isandhlwana for week or rather month to
come
of all my experi thi wa i think the strangest after
that night of hell to find myself alon upon thi field of
death stare everywher at the distort face which on the
previou morn i had seen so full of life yet my physic need
assert themselv i wa veri hungri who for twentyfour
hour had eaten noth faint with hunger inde i pass a
provis wagon that had been loot by the zulu tin of bulli
beef lai about also among a wreck of broken glass some bottl
of basss beer which had escap their notic i found an
assegai clean it in the ground which it need and open
on of the tin lai down in a tuft of grass by a dead man or
rather between him and some zulu whom he had kill and
devour it content also i knock the top off a coupl of
the beer bottl and drank my fill while i wa do thi a
larg rough dog with a silvermount collar on it neck i think
of the sort that is call an airedal terrier came up to me
whine at first i thought it wa an hyena but discov my
mistak threw it some bit of meat which it at greedili
doubtless it had belong to some dead offic though there wa
no name on the collar the poor beast which i name lost at
onc attach itself to me and here i mai sai that i kept it
till it death which occur of jaundic at durban not long
befor i start on my journei to king solomon mine no man
ever had a more faith friend and companion
when i had eaten and drunk i look about me wonder what i
should do fifti yard awai i saw a stout basuto poni still
saddl and bridl although the saddl wa twist out of it
proper posit which wa crop the grass as well as it could
with the bit in it mouth advanc gentli i caught it without
troubl and led it back to the plunder wagon evid from
the mark upon the saddleri it had belong to captain
shepston forc of mount nativ
here i fill the larg saddlebag made of buckskin with tin of
beef a coupl more bottl of beer and a packet of tandstickor
match which i wa fortun enough to find also i took the
martini rifl from a dead soldier togeth with a score or so of
cartridg that remain in hi belt for appar he must have
been kill rather earli in the fight
thu equip i mount the poni and onc more bethought me of
escap to natal a look toward the nek cure me of that idea
for come over it i saw the plume head of a whole hord of
warrior doubtless these were return from the unsuccess
attack on rork drift though of that i knew noth at the
time so whistl to the dog i bore to the left for the nqutu
hill ride as fast as the rough ground would allow and in
half an hour wa out of sight of that accurs plain
on more thing too i did on it confin i came across a group
of dead zulu who appear to have been kill by a shell
dismount i took the headdress of on of them and put it on
for i forgot to sai that i had lost my hat it wa made of a
band of otterskin from which rose larg tuft of the black
feather of the finch which the nativ call sakabula also i
ti hi kilt of white oxtail about my middl precaut to
which i have littl doubt i ow my life sinc from a distanc
thei made me look like a kaffir mount on a captur poni
then i start on again whither i knew not
chapter xix
allan awak
now i have no intent of set down all the detail of that
dread journei through zululand even if i could recal them
which for a reason to be state i cannot do i rememb that
at first i thought of proceed to ulundi with some wild idea of
throw myself on the merci of cetewayo under pretenc that i
brought him a messag from natal within a coupl of hour
howev from the top of a hill i saw ahead of me an impi and
with it captur wagon which wa evid head for the
king kraal so as i knew what kind of a greet these
warrior would give me i bore awai in anoth direct with the
hope of reach the border by a circuit rout in thi too i
had no luck sinc present i caught sight of outpost station
upon rock which doubtless belong to anoth impi or regiment
inde on soldier think from my dress that i also wa a
zulu call to me for new from about half a mile awai in that
peculiar carri voic which kaffir can command i shout
back someth about victori and that the white men were wipe
out then put an end to the convers by vanish into a
patch of dens bush
it is a fact that after thi i have onli the dimmest recollect
of what happen i rememb offsaddl at night on sever
occas i rememb be veri hungri becaus all the food wa
eaten and the dog lost catch a bush buck fawn some of which
i partial cook on a fire of dead wood and devour next i
rememberi suppos thi wa a dai or two laterrid at night
in a thunderstorm and a particularli brilliant flash of lightn
which reveal sceneri that seem to be familiar to me after
which came a shock and total unconsci
at length my mind return to me it wa reborn veri slowli and
with horribl convuls out of the womb of death and terror
i saw blood flow round me in river i heard the cri of
triumph and of agoni i saw myself stand the sole survivor
on a grei field of death and the utter loneli of it at into
my soul so that with all it strength it prai that it might be
number in thi harvest but oh it wa so strong that soul
which could not would not die or fly awai so strong that
then for the first time i understood it immort and that
it could never die thi everlast thing still clung for a
while to the bodi of it humili the mass of clai and nerv
and appetit which it wa doom to anim and yet knew it
own separ and etern individu strive to be free
of earth still it seem to walk the earth a spirit and a
shadow awar of the hate of that to which it wa chain
as we might imagin some love butterfli to be that is fate by
natur to suck it strength from carrion and remain unabl to
soar awai into the clean air of heaven
someth touch my hand and i reflect dreamili that if i had
been still aliv for in a wai i believ that i wa dead i
should have thought it wa a dog tongu with a great effort i
lift my arm open my ey and look at the hand against the
light for there wa light to see it wa so thin that thi light
shone through between the bone then i let it fall again and
lo it rest on the head of a dog which went on lick it
a dog what dog now i rememb on that i had found on the
field of isandhlwana then i must be still aliv the thought
made me cry for i could feel the tear run down my cheek not
with joi but with sorrow i did not wish to go on live life
wa too full of struggl and of bloodsh and bereav and
fear and all horribl thing i wa prepar to exchang my part
in it just for rest for the bless of deep unend sleep in
which no more dream could come no more cup of joi could be
held to thirst lip onli to be snatch awai
i heard someth shuffl toward me at which the dog growl
then seem to slink awai as though it were afraid i open my
ey again look and close them onc more in terror for what
i saw suggest that perhap i wa dead after all and had reach
that hell which a certain class of earnest christian promis to
us as the reward of the fail that natur and those who begat
us have hand on to us as a birth doom it wa someth
unnatur greyhead terrificdoubtless a devil come to
torment me in the inquisit vault of hade yet i had known
the like when i wa aliv how had it been call i
rememb thethingthatnevershouldhavebeenborn hark
it wa speak in that full deep voic which wa unlik to ani
other
greet macumazahn it said i see that you have come back
from among the dead with whom you have been dwell for a moon
and more it is not wise of you macumazahn yet i am glad who
have match my skill against death and won for now you will
have much to tell me about hi kingdom
so it wa zikalizikali who had butcher my friend
awai from me murder i said faintli and let me die or
kill me as you did the other
he laugh but veri softli not in hi usual terrif fashion
repeat the word murder two or three time then with hi
great hand he lift my head gentli as a woman might sai
look befor you macumazahn
i look and saw that i wa in some kind of a cave outsid the
sun wa set and against it bright i perceiv two
figur a white man and a white woman who were walk hand in
hand and gaze into each other ey thei were anscomb and
heda pass the mouth of the cave
behold the murder o macumazahn dealer of hard word
it is onli a trick i murmur kaatj saw them dead and
buri
ye ye i forgot the fat foolwoman saw them dead and
buri well sometim the dead come to life again and for good
purpos as you should know macumazahn who follow the counsel
of a certain mameena and wander here instead of rush onto
the zulu spear
i tri to think the thing out and could not so onli ask
how did i come what happen to me
i think the sun smote you first who had no cover on your head
and the lightn smote you afterward yet all the while that
reason had left you on led your hors and after the heaven had
tri to kill you and fail perhap becaus my magic wa too
strong for them on sent that beast which you found ye sent
it here to lead us to where you lai there you were discov
and brought hither now sleep lest you should go further than
even i can fetch you back again
he held hi hand abov my head seem to grow in statur till
hi white hair touch the roof of the cave and in an instant i
fanci that i wa fall awai deep deep into a gulf of
nothing
there follow anoth period of dream in which dream i
seem to meet all sort of peopl dead and live especi
ladi ragnal a friend of mine with whom i had been concern in
a veri strang adventur among the kendah peopl and with whom
in dai to come i wa destin to be concern again although of
cours i knew noth of thi in a still stranger adventur of
what i mai call a spiritu order which i mai or mai not try to
reduc to write it seem to me that i wa constantli dine
with her teteatet and that she told me all sort of queer
thing between the cours doubtless these illus occur
when i wa fed
see the book call the ivori childeditor
at length i woke up again feel much stronger and saw the
dog lost watch me with it great tender eyesoh thei talk
of the ey of women but ar thei ever as beauti as those of
a love dog it lai by my low bedstead a rough affair
fashion of pole and strung with rimpi or string of raw hide
and by it stroke it head sat the witchdoctoress nomb i
rememb how pleas she look a perfect type of the etern
feminin with her grace round shape and her continu
mysteri smile which suggest so much more than ani mortal
woman ha to give
gooddai to you macumazahn she said in her gentl voic you
have gone through much sinc last we met on the night befor goza
took you awai to ulundi
now rememb all i wa fill with indign against thi
littl humbug
the last time we met nomb i said wa when you plai the
part of a woman who is dead in the vale of bone by the king
kraal
she regard me with a kindli commiser and answer
shake her head
you have been veri ill macumazahn and your spirit still trick
you i plai the part of no woman in ani vallei by the king
kraal nor were my ey rejoic with the sight of you there or
elsewher till thei brought you to thi place so chang that i
should scarc have known you
you littl liar i said rude
do the white peopl alwai name those liar who tell them true
thing thei cannot understand she inquir with a sweet
innoc then without wait for an answer she pat my
hand as though i were a fret child and gave me some soup in a
gourd sai drink it it is good the ladi heddana made it
herself in the white man fashion
i drank the soup which wa veri good and as i hand back the
gourd answer
kaatj ha told me that the ladi heddana is dead can the dead
make soup
she consid the point while she threw some bit of meat out of
the bottom of the gourd to the dog lost then repli
i do not know macumazahn or inde whether the dead eat as we
do next time my spirit visit me i will make inquiri and tell
you the answer but i do know that it is veri strang that you
who alwai turn your back upon the truth ar so readi to accept
falsehood why should you believ that the ladi heddana is dead
just becaus kaatj told you so when i who am still aliv had
sworn to you that i would protect her with my life nai speak
no more now tomorrow if you ar well enough you shall see and
judg for yourself
she drew up the kaross over me again pat my hand in her
motherli fashion and depart still smile after which i went
to sleep again so dreamlessli that i think there wa some nativ
soporif in that soup
on the follow dai two of zikali servant who did the rougher
work of my sick room if i mai so call it arriv and said that
thei were go to carri me out of the cave for a while if that
were my will i who long to breath the fresh air again said
that it wa veri much my will whereon thei grasp the rough
bedstead which i have describ by either end and veri carefulli
bore me down the cave and through it narrow entranc where thei
set the bedstead in the shadow of the overhang rock without
when i had recov a littl for even that short journei tire
me i look about me and perceiv that as i had expect i wa
in the black kloof for there in front of me were the veri hut
which we had occupi on our arriv from swaziland
i lai a while draw in the sweet air which to me wa like a
draught of nectar and wonder whether i were not still in a
dream for instanc i wonder if i had truli seen the figur
of anscomb and heda pass the mouth of the cave on that dai when
i awok or if these were but anoth of zikali illus
imprint on my weaken mind by hi will power for of what he
and nomb told me i believ noth thu marvel i fell
into a doze and in my doze heard whisper i open my ey
and lo there befor me stood anscomb and heda it wa she who
spoke the first for i wa tongueti i could not open my lip
dear mr quatermain dear mr quatermain she murmur in her
sweet voic then paus
now at last word came to me i thought you were both dead i
said tell me ar you realli aliv
she bent down and kiss my brow while anscomb took my hand
now you know she answer we ar both of us aliv and
well
thank god i exclaim kaatj swore that she saw you dead
and buri
on see strang thing in the black kloof repli anscomb
speak for the first time and much ha happen to us sinc
we were part to which you ar not strong enough to listen now
when you ar better then we will tell you all so grow well as
soon as you can
after thi i think i faint for when i came to myself again i
wa back in the cave
anoth ten dai or so went by befor i could even leav my bed
for my recoveri wa veri slow inde for week i could scarc
walk at all and six whole month pass befor i realli got my
strength again and becam as i us to be dure those dai i
often saw anscomb and heda but onli for a few minut at a
time also occasion zikali would visit me speak a
littl gener about past histori or someth of the sort
but never of the war and go awai at length on dai he said to
me
macumazahn now i am sure you ar go to live a matter as to
which i wa doubt even after you seem to recov for
macumazahn you have endur three shock of which todai i am
not afraid to talk to you first there wa that of the battl of
isandhlwana where you were the last white man left aliv
how do you know that zikali i ask
it doe not matter i do know did you not ride through the
zulu who part thi wai and that befor you shout what you
could not understand on of them you mai rememb even salut
with hi spear
i did zikali tell me why did thei behav thu and what did
thei shout
i shall not tell you macumazahn think over it for the rest of
your life and conclud what you choos it will not be so
wonder as the truth at least thei did so as a certain doll
i dress up yonder in the vale of bone told you thei would she
whose advic you follow in ride toward ulundi instead of
back to the river where you would have met your death like so
mani other of the white peopl
who wa that doll zikali
nai ask me not perhap it wa nomb perhap anoth i have
forgotten i am veri old and my memori begin to plai me strang
trick still i recollect that she wa a good doll so like a
dead woman call mameena that i could scarc have known them
apart ah that wa a great game i plai in the vale of bone
wa it not macumazahn
ye zikali yet i do not understand why it wa plai
be so young you still have the impati of youth
macumazahn although your hair grow white wait a while and you
will understand all well you lai that night on the topmost
rock of isandhlwana and there you saw and heard strang thing
you heard the rest of the white soldier come and lie down to
rest among their dead brother and depart again unharm oh
what fool ar these zulu gener nowadai thei send out an
impi to attack men behind wall spear against rifl and ar
defeat had thei kept that impi to fall on the rest of the
english when thei walk into the trap not a man of your peopl
would have been left aliv would that have happen in the time
of chaka
i think not zikali still i am glad that it did happen
i think not too macumazahn but small men small wit also
like you i am glad that it did not happen sinc it is the zulu
i hate not the english who have now learn a lesson and will
not be caught again oh mani a captain in zululand is todai
flat as a prick bladder and even their victori as thei call
it cost them dear for mind you macumazahn for everi white
man thei kill two of them di so so in the morn you
left the hilldo not look astonish macumazahn perhap those
captain on the rock beneath you let you go for their own
purpos or becaus thei were command for though weak i can
still lift a stone or two macumazahn and afterward told me all
about it then you found yourself alon among the dead like the
last man in the world macumazahn and that dog at your side
also a hors came to you perhap i sent them perhap it wa a
chanc who know not i myself for as i have said my memori
ha grown so bad that wa your first shock macumazahn the
shock of stand alon among the dead like the last man in the
world you felt it did you not
as i hope i shall never feel anyth again it nearli drove me
mad i answer
veri nearli inde though i have felt wors thing and onli
laugh as i would tell you had i the time well then the sun
struck you for at thi season of the year it is veri hot in
those vallei for a white man with no cover to hi head and
you went quit mad though fortun the dog and the hors
remain as heaven had made them that wa the second shock
then the storm burst and the lightn fell it ran down the
rifl that you still carri macumazahn i will show it to you
and you will see that it stock is shatter perhap i turn
the flash asid for i am a great thunderherd or perhap it wa
on mightier than i that wa the third shock macumazahn then
you were found still livinghow the white man your friend
will tell you but you should cherish that dog of your
macumazahn for mani a man might have serv you wors and
be strong though small or perhap becaus you still have
work left to do in the world befor you leav it for a while you
have live through all these thing and will in time recov
though not yet
i hope so zikali though on the whole i am not sure that i wish
to recov
ye you do macumazahn becaus the religion of you white men
make you fear death and what mai come after it you think of
what you call your sin and ar afraid lest you should be
tortur becaus of them not understand that the spirit must
be judg not by what the flesh ha done but by what the spirit
desir to do by will not by deed macumazahn the evil man
is he who wish to do evil not he who wish to do good and
fall now and again into evil oh i have hearken to your
white teacher and i know i know
then by your own standard you ar evil zikali sinc you wish
to bring about war and not in vain
oho macumazahn you think that do you who cannot understand
that what seem to be evil is often good i wish to bring
about war and brought it about and mayb what bred the wish wa
all that i have suffer in the past but sai you who have seen
what the zulu power mean who have seen men women and children
kill by the thousand to feed that power and who have seen
too what the english power mean is it evil that i should wish
to destroi the hous of the zulu king that the english hous mai
take it place and that in a time to come the black peopl mai be
free
you ar clever zikali but it is of your own wrong that you
think how about that skull which you kiss in the vale of
bone
mayhap macumazahn but my wrong ar the wrong of a nation
therefor i think of the nation and at least i do not fear death
like you white men now hearken present your friend will
tell you a stori the ladi heddana will tell you how i made us
of her for a certain purpos for which purpos inde i drew the
three of you into zululand becaus without her i could not have
brought about thi war into which cetewayo did not wish to enter
when you have heard that stori do not judg me too hardli
macumazahn who had a great end to gain
yet whatev the stori mai be i do judg you hardli zikali
who torment me with a fals tale caus the woman kaatj to
lie to me and swear that she saw these two dead befor herhow i
know not
she did not lie to you macumazahn ha not such a on as i the
power to make a fat fool think that she saw what she did not see
as to how how did i make you think in yonder hut of mine that
you saw what you did not seeperhap
but why did you mock me in thi fashion zikali
truli macumazahn you ar blind as a bat in sunlight when
your friend have told you the stori you will understand why
yet i admit to you that thing went wrong you should have heard
that tale befor cetewayo brought you to the vale of bone
but the foolwoman delai and blunder and when she reach
ulundi the gate were shut against her as a spy and not open
till too late so that you onli found her when you return from
the council i knew thi and that wa why i dare to bid you
fire at that which stood upon the rock had you heard kaatj
tale you might have aim straight as also you would have
certainli shot straight at me out of reveng for the death of
those you love macumazahn though whether you could have kill
me befor all the game is plai is anoth matter as it wa i
wa sure that you would not pierc the heart of on who might
be a certain white woman sure also that you would not pierc my
heart whose death might bring about her death and that of
anoth
you ar veri subtl zikali i said in astonish
so you hold becaus i am veri simpl who understand the spirit
of manand some other thing for the rest had you not
believ that these two were dead you would never have left
zululand you would have tri to escap to get to them and have
been kill is it not so
ye i think i should have tri zikali but why did you keep
them prison
for the same reason that i still keep themand youto hold
them back a while from the world of ghost had i sent them awai
after that night of the declar of war thei would have been
kill befor thei had gone an hour journei oh i am not so
bad as you think macumazahn and i never break my word now i
have done
how goe the war i ask as he shuffl to hi feet
as it must go veri ill for the zulu thei have driven back
the white men who gather strength from over the black water and
will come on present and wipe them out umnyamana would have
had cetewayo invad natal and sweep it clean as of cours he
should have done but i sent him word that if he did so
nomkubulwana ye she and no other had told me that all the
spirit would be against him and he hearken when next you
think me wick rememb that macumazahn now it is but a
matter of time and here you must bide till all is finish
that will be good for you who need rest though the other two
find it wearisom still for them it is good also to watch the
fruit ripen on their tree of love it will be the sweeter when
thei eat it macumazahn and teach them how to live togeth
oho ohoho and he shambl off

spoke men arriv with a litter that had grass mat hung round
it nomb brought out my long cape and put it over me also a
kind of veil of white stuff which she threw over my head so as
to hide my face i think it wa made out of on of our
travel mosquito net then she said i must sai goodby to
mauric for a while there wa a scene as you mai imagin he
grew angri and said that he would come with me whereon arm men
appear six of them and push him awai with the handl of

flat boulder at the end of the rock there you will take your

given to you nomb will not accompani you to the rock but she
will crouch between the stone at the head of the path and
perhap from time to time whisper to you what to do thu when
she tell you you must throw the littl spear into the air so
that it fall among a number of men gather in debat who will
be seat about twenti pace from the rock for the rest you ar
to stand quit still sai noth and show no alarm

the matter over in the land of ghost
on hear thi i said i would do my best to carri out hi
order and after make me repeat them onc more he went awai
later nomb dress me up as you saw me mr quatermain put
some glitter powder into my hair and touch me beneath the
ey with a dark kind of pigment also she gave me the littl
spear and made me practis stand quit still with it rais in
my right hand tell me that when i heard her sai the word
throw i wa to cast it into the air then the moon rose and
we heard men talk at a distanc at last some on came to the
hut and whisper to nomb who led me out to the littl path
between the rock
thi must have been nearli two hour after i heard the men begin
to talk
excus me i interrupt but where wa nomb all those two
hour
with me she never left my side mr quatermain and while i
wa on the rock she wa crouch within three pace of me between
two big stone at the mouth of the path
inde i repli faintli thi is veri interest pleas
continuebut on word how wa nomb dress did she wear a
necklac of blue bead
just as she alwai is or rather less so for she had noth on
except her moocha and certainli no blue bead but why do you
ask
from curios mere i mean i will tell you afterward prai
go on
well i step forward on to the rock and at first saw noth
becaus at that moment the moon wa hid by a cloud inde nomb
had wait for the cloud to pass over it face befor she thrust
me forward also some smoke from a fire below wa rise
straight in front of me present the cloud pass the smoke
thin and i saw the circl of those savag men seat beneath
and in their centr a great chief wear a leopard skin cloak
who i guess wa the king you i did not see mr quatermain
becaus you were behind a tree yet i felt that you were there a
friend among all those foe i stood still as i had been taught
to do and heard the murmur of astonish and caught the gleam
of the moonlight from the white feather that were sewn upon my
robe
then i heard also the voic of zikali speak from beneath he
call on you to come out to shoot at me and the man whom i took
to be the king order you to obei you appear from behind
the tree and i wa certain from the look upon your face that at
that distanc you did not know who i wa in my strang and
glitter raiment you lift the pistol and i wa terribl
afraid for i had seen you shoot with it befor on the verandah
of the templ and knew well that you do not miss veri nearli i
scream out to you but rememb and wa silent think that
after all it did not much matter if i di except for the sake
of mauric here also by now i guess that i wa be us to
deceiv those men befor me into some terribl act and that if i
di at least thei would be undeceiv
i thought that an ag pass between the time you point the
pistol and i saw the flash for which i wa wait
you need not have wait heda i interpos for if i had
realli aim at you you would never have seen that flash at
least so it is said i too guess enough to shoot abov you
although at the time i did not know that it wa you on the rock
inde i thought it wa nomb paint up
ye i heard the bullet sing over me then i heard the voic of
zikali challeng you to shoot him and to tell the truth hope
that you would do so just befor you fire for the second time
nomb whisper to methrow and i threw the littl redhandl
spear into the air then as the pistol went off nomb
whisperedcom i slip awai down the path and back with
her into the hut where she kiss me and said that i had done
well inde after which she took off my strang robe and help
me to put on my own dress
that is all i know except that some hour later i wa awaken
from sleep and put into the litter where i went to sleep again
for what i had gone through tire me veri much i need not
troubl you with the rest for we journei here in the same wai
that we had journei to ulundibi night i did not see zikali
but in answer to my question nomb told me that the zulu had
declar war against the english what part in the busi i
had plai she would not tell me and i do not know to thi
hour but i am sure that it wa a great on
so we came back to the black kloof where i found mauric quit
well and now he had better go on with the tale for if i begin
to tell you of our meet i shall becom foolish
there isnt much more to tell said anscomb except about
yourself while heda wa awai i wa kept a prison and watch
dai and night by zikali peopl who would not let me stir a
yard but otherwis treat me kindli then on dai at sunris
or shortli after it heda reappear and told me all thi stori
for the end of which as you mai imagin i thank god
after that we just live on here happili enough sinc we were
togeth until on dai nomb told us that there had been a great
battl in which the zulu had wipe out the english kill
hundr and hundr of them although for everi soldier that
thei kill thei had lost two of cours thi made us veri sad
especi as we were afraid you might be with our troop we
ask nomb if you were present at the battl she answer that
she would inquir of her spirit and went through some veri
strang perform with ash and knuckl bone after which
she announc that you had been in the battl but were aliv and
come thi wai with a dog that had silver on it we laugh at
her sai that she could not possibl know anyth of the
sort also that dog as a rule did not carri silver whereon she
onli smile and saidwait
i think it wa three dai later that on night toward dawn i
wa awaken by hear a dog bark outsid my hut as though
it wish to call attent to it presenc it bark so
persist and in a wai so unlik a kaffir dog that at length
about dawn i went out of the hut to see what wa the matter
there stand a few yard awai surround by some of zikali
peopl i saw lost and knew at onc that it wa an english
airedal for i have had sever of the breed it look veri
tire and frighten and while i wa wonder whenc on earth
it could have come i notic that it had a silvermount collar
and rememb nomb and her talk about you and a dog that
carri silver on it from that moment allan i wa certain
that you were somewher near especi as the beast ran up to
meit would take no notic of the kaffirsand kept look
toward the mouth of the kloof as though it wish me to follow
it just then nomb arriv and on see the dog look at me
oddli
i have a messag for you from my master mauriti she said to
me through heda who by now had arriv upon the scene have
also been arous by lost bark it is that if you wish to
take a walk with a strang dog you can do so and bring back
anyth you mai find
the end of it wa that after we had fed lost with milk and meat
i and six of zikali men start down the kloof lost go
ahead of us and now and again run back and whine at the
mouth of the kloof it led us over a hill and down into a
bushveld vallei where the thorn grew veri thick when we had
gone along the vallei for about two mile on of the kaffir saw
a basuto poni still saddl and caught it the dog went on past
the poni to a tree that had been shatter by lightn and
there within a few yard of the tree we found you ly
senseless allan or as i thought at first dead and by your
side a martini rifl of which the stock also seem to have been
broken by lightn
well we put you on a shield and carri you here meet no
on and that is all the stori allan
he stop and we stare at each other then i call lost and
pat it head and the dear beast lick my hand as though it
understood that it wa be thank
a strang tale i said but god almighti ha put much wisdom
into hi creatur of which we know noth let us thank him
and in our heart we did
thu wa i rescu from death by the intellig and fidel of
a fourfoot creatur doubtless in my semiconsci state
that result from shock weari and sunstrok i had all the
while head subconsci and without ani definit object for
the black kloof when i wa within a few mile of it i wa
stun by the lightn which ran down the rifl to the ground
though not actual struck then the dog which had escap
plai it part wander about the countri to find help for me
and so i wa save
now of the long month that follow i have littl to tell thei
were not unhappi in their wai for week by week i felt myself
grow stronger though veri slowli there wa a path steep
difficult and secret which could be gain through on of the
cave in the precipic not that in which i slept thi path ran
up a watercut kloof through a patch of thorn to a flat
tableland that wa part of the ceza stronghold by it when i
had gain suffici strength sometim we us to climb to the
plateau and there take exercis it wa an agreeabl chang from
the stifl atmospher of the black kloof the dai were veri
dull for we were as much out of the world as though we had been
maroon on a desert island still from time to time we heard of
the progress of the war through nomb for zikali i saw but
seldom
she told of disast to the english of the death of a great
young chief who wa desert by hi companion and di fight
bravelyafterward i discov that thi wa the princ
imperi of franceof the advanc of our armi of defeat
inflict upon cetewayo impi and final of the destruct
of the zulu on the battlefield of ulundi where thei hurl
themselv by thousand upon the british squar to be swept awai
by caseshot and the hail of bullet thi battl by the wai
the zulu call not ulundi or nodwengu for it wa fought in
front of panda old kraal of that name but ocwecweni which
meansth fight of the sheetiron fortress i suppos thei
give it thi name becaus the hedg of bayonet flash in the
sunlight remind them of sheetiron or it mai be becaus
these prove as impenetr as would have done wall of iron
at ani rate thei dash their nake bodi against the storm of
lead and fell in heap onli about a dozen of our men be
kill as the littl graveyard in the centr of the squar
entrench about which still lie the empti cartridg case
record todai
there then on that plain perish the zulu kingdom which wa
built up by chaka
now it wa after thi event that i saw zikali and beg him to
let us go i found him triumphant and yet strang disturb
and as i thought more apprehens than i had ever seen him
so zikali i said if what i hear is true you have had your
wai and destroi the zulu peopl now you should be happi
is man ever happi macumazahn when he ha gain that which he
sought for year the two out there sigh and ar sad becaus
thei cannot be marri after their own white fashion though what
there is to keep them apart i do not know well in time thei
will be marri onli to find that thei ar not so happi as thei
thought thei would be oh a dai will come when thei will talk
to each other and saythos moon which we spent wait
togeth in the black kloof were the true moon of sweet for
then we had someth to gain now we have gain alland what
is it
so it is with me macumazahn sinc the zulu under chaka
kill out my peopl the ndwandw year by year i have plot
and wait to see them wed to the assegai now it ha come
about you white men have stamp them flat upon the plain of
ulundi thei ar no more a nation and yet i am not happi for
after all it wa the hous of senzangacona and not the peopl of
the zulu that harm me and mine and cetewayo still live
while the queen bee remain there mai be a hive again while an
ember still glow in the dead ash the forest mai yet be fire
perhap when cetewayo is dead then i shall be happi onli hi
death and mine ar set by fate as close togeth as two sister
grain of corn upon the cob
i turn the subject again ask hi leav to depart to natal
or to join the english armi
you cannot go yet he answer sternli so troubl me no more
the land is full of wander band of zulu who would kill you
and your blood would be on my head moreov if thei saw a
white woman who had shelter with me might thei not guess
someth to dress a doll for the part of the inkosazanayzulu
is the greatest crime in the world macumazahn and what would
happen to the open of road and all hi hous if it were even
breath that he had dress that doll and thu brought about the
war which ruin them when cetewayo is kill and the dead ar
buri and peac fall upon the land the peac of death then
you shall go macumazahn and not befor
at least zikali send a messag to the captain of the english
armi and tell them that we ar here
send a messag to the hyena and tell them where the carcas is
send a messag to the hunter and tell them where the buck zikali
crouch on it form hearken macumazahn if you do thi or
even urg me again to do it neither you nor your friend shall
ever leav the black kloof i have spoken
then understand that the case wa hopeless i left him and he
glower after me for fear had made him cruel he had won the
long game and success had turn to ash in hi mouth or
rather he had not wonyetsinc hi war wa against the hous
of senzangacona from which he and hi tribe had suffer cruel
wrong to pull it down he must pull down the zulu nation it wa
like burn a citi to destroi a compromis letter he had
burnt the citi but the letter still remain intact and might be
produc in evid against him in other word cetewayo yet
live therefor hi vengeanc remain quit unslak and hi
danger wa as great or perhap greater than it had ever been
befor for wa he not the prophet who by produc the princess
of heaven the tradit goddess of the zulu befor the ey
of the king and council had caus them to decid for war and
suppos it were so much as breath that thi spirit which thei
seem to see had been but a trick and a fraud what then he
would be tortur to death if hi dupe had time or torn limb
from limb if thei had not that is if he could die like other
mena matter as to which person i had no doubt
shortli after i left zikali heda and i at our even meal
togeth anscomb as it chanc had gone by the secret path
to the tableland of which i have spoken where he amus himself
as of cours we were not allow to fire a gun by catch
partridg with the help of an ingeni system of grass net
which he had invent there were spring on thi tableland that
form littl pool of water at which the partridg also
occasion guineafowl and bush pheasant came to drink at
sunris and sunset here it wa that he set hi net and retir
to work them at those hour by mean of string that he pull
from hidingplac so heda and i were alon
i told her of my ill success with zikali at which she wa much
disappoint then by an afterthought i suggest that perhap
she might try to do someth in the wai of get a messag
through to the english camp at ulundi or elsewher by help of
the witchdoctoress nomb ad that i would speak to her
myself had i not observ that i seem to be out of favour with
her of late heda shook her head and answer that she thought
it would be useless to try also too danger rememb
zikali threat on reflect i agre with her
tell me mr quatermain she ad is it possibl for on
woman to be in love with anoth
i stare at her and repli that i did not understand what she
meant sinc women so far as i had observ them were gener
in love either with a man or with themselv perhap more often
with the latter than the former rather a cheap joke i admit
with just enough truth in it to make it acceptablein the black
kloof
so i thought she answer but realli nomb behav in a most
peculiar wai as you know she took a fanci to me from the
begin perhap becaus she had never had ani other woman with
whom to associ have so far as i can make out been brought
up here among men from a child inde her stori is that she
wa on of twin and therefor as the younger wa expos to die
accord to the zulu superstit zikali howev or a
servant of hi who knew what wa happen rescu and rear
her so practic i am the onli femal with whom she ha ever
been intim at ani rate her affect for me ha grown and
grown until although it seem ungrat to sai so it ha
becom someth of a nuisanc she ha told me again and again
that she would die to protect me and that if by chanc anyth
happen to me she would kill herself and follow me into anoth
world she is continu make divin about my futur
and as these in which she entir believ alwai show me as
live without her she is much distress and at time burst
into tear
hysteria it is veri common among the zulu women and
especi those of them who practis magic art i answer
perhap but as it result in the most intens jealousi nomb
hysteria is awkward for instanc she is horribl jealou of
mauric
the instinct of a chaperon develop earli i suggest
again
that wont quit do mr quatermain answer heda with a
laugh sinc she is even more jealou of you with refer to
mauric she explain frankli that if we marri she might as she
put it continu to sit outsid the hut but that in your case
you live in my head where she cannot come between you and me
mad i remark quit mad still mad ha to be dealt
with in thi world like other thing and nomb be an
abnorm person mai suffer from abnorm idea it just amount
to thi she ha conceiv a passion devot to you at which
i am sure neither mauric nor i can wonder
ar those the kind of compliment you us to pai in your youth
mr quatermain i expect so and now that you ar old you cannot
stop them well i thank you all the same becaus perhap you
mean what you sai but what is to be done about nomb hush
here she come i will leav you to reason with her if you get
the chanc and she depart in a hurri
nomb arriv and someth in her aspect told me that i wa
go to get the chanc her etern smile wa almost gone and
her dark beauti ey flash omin still she began by
ask in a mild voic whether the ladi heddana had eaten her
supper with appetit it will be observ that she wa not
interest in my appetit or whether enough wa left for anscomb
when he return i repli that so far as i note she had
consum about half a partridg with other thing
i am glad said nomb sinc i wa not here to attend upon
her have been summon to speak with the master
then she sat down and look at me like a thunder storm
i nurs you when you were so ill macumazahn she began but
now i learn that for the milk with which i fed you you would
forc me to drink bitter water that will poison me
i repli i wa well awar that without her nurs i should long
ago have been dead which wa what caus me to love her like my
own daughter but would she kindli explain thi she did at
onc
you have been plot to take awai from me the ladi heddana who
to me is as mother and sister and child it is useless to lie to
me for the master ha told me all moreov i knew it for
myself both through my spirit and becaus i had watch you
i have no intent of ly to you nomb about thi or ani
other matter though i think that sometim in the past you have
li to me tell me do you expect the inkosi mauriti the ladi
heddana and myself to pass the rest of our live in the black
kloof when thei wish to get marri and go across the black
water to where their home will be and i wish to attend to my
affair
i do not know what i expect macumazahn but i do know that
never while i live will i be part from the ladi heddana at
last i have found some on to love and you and the other would
steal her awai from me
i studi her for a while then ask
why do you not marri nomb and have a husband and children to
love
marri she repli i am marri to my spirit which doe not
dwell beneath the sun and my children ar not of earth
moreov all men ar hate to me and her ey ad
especi you
that is a calf with a dog head i repli in the word of the
nativ proverb mean that she said what wa not natur
well nomb if you ar so fond of the ladi heddana you had
better arrang with her and the inkosi mauriti to go awai with
them
you know well i cannot macumazahn i am ti to my master by
rope that ar stronger than iron and if i attempt to break
them my spirit would wither and i should wither with it
dear me what a dread busi that is what come of take
to magic well nomb i am afraid i have noth to suggest
nor to tell you the truth can i see what i have to do with the
matter
then she sprang up in a rage sai
i understand that not onli will you give me no help but that
you also mock at me macumazahn moreov as it is with you so
it is with mauriti who pretend to love my ladi so much though
i love her more with my littl finger than he doe with all hi
bodi and what he call hi soul ye he too mock at me now
if you were both dead she ad with sudden venom my ladi
would not wish to go awai be care lest a spell should fall
upon you macumazahn and without more word she turn and
went
at first i wa inclin to laugh the whole thing seem so
absurd on reflect howev i perceiv that in realiti it
wa veri seriou to peopl situat as we were thi woman wa a
savag more a mystic savag of consider power of minda
formid combin also there were no restraint upon her
sinc public opinion had as littl author in the black kloof
as the queen writ lastli it wa not unknown for women to
conceiv these violent affect which if thwart fill them
with someth like mad thu i rememb a veri terribl
occurr of my youth which result in the death of on who wa
most dear to me i will not dwell on it but thi too wa the
work of a passion creatur woman i can scarc call her who
thought she wa be rob of on whom she ador
the end of it wa that i did not enjoi my pipe that night though
luckili anscomb return after a success even net
about which he wa so full of talk that there wa no need for me
to sai much so i put off ani discuss of the problem until
the morrow
chapter xxi
the king visit zikali
next morn as a result of my cogit i went to see
zikali i wa admit after a good deal of troubl and delai
for although hi retinu wa limit and with the except of
nomb entir male thi old prophet kept a kind of semist
and wa about as difficult to approach as a european monarch i
found him crouch over a fire in hi hut sinc at thi season
of the year even in that hot place the air wa chilli until
middai
what is it macumazahn he ask as to your go awai have
patienc i learn that he who wa king of the zulu is in full
flight with the white men track him like a wound buck
when the buck is caught and kill then you can go
it is about nomb i answer and told him all the stori
which did not seem to surpris him at all
now see macumazahn he said take some snuff how hard it
is to dam up the stream of natur thi child nomb is of my
blood on whom i save from death in a strang wai not becaus
she wa of my blood but that i might make an experi with her
women as you who ar wise and have seen much will know ar in
truth superior to men though becaus thei ar weaker in bodi
men have the upper hand of them and think themselv their
master a state thei ar forc to accept becaus thei must live
and cannot defend themselv yet their brain ar keener as an
assegai is keener than a hoe thei ar more in touch with the
hidden thing that shape out fate for peopl and for nation
thei ar more faith and more patient and by instinct if not
by reason more farse or at least the best of them ar so
and by their best like men thei should be judg yet thi is
the hole in their shield when thei love thei becom the slave
of love and for love sake all els is brought to naught and
for thi reason thei cannot be trust with men as you know
thi is otherwis thei too love by natur law but alwai
behind there is someth greater than love although often thei
do not understand what that mai be to be power therefor a
woman must be on who doe not love too much if she cannot love
at all then she is hate and ha no power but she must not love
too much
onc i thought that i had found such a woman she wa name
mameena whom all men worship and who plai with all men as
i plai with her but what wa the end of it just as thing
were go veri well she learn to love too much some man of
strang notion who would have thwart me and brought
everyth to noth and therefor i had to kill her for which
i wa sorri
here he paus to take some more snuff watch me over the
spoon as he drew it up hi great nostril but as i said noth
went on
now after mameena wa dead i bethought me that i would rear up a
woman who could still love but should never love a man and
therefor never becom mad or foolish becaus i believ that it
wa onli man who in take her heart from woman would take her
wit also thi child nomb came to my hand and as i thought
so i did never mind how i did it by medicin perhap by magic
perhap by water her pride and make it grow tall perhap
or by all three at least it wa done and thi i know of nomb
she will never care for ani man except as a woman mai care for a
brother
but now see what happen she the wise the instruct the
mandespis meet a woman of anoth race who is sweet and
good and learn to love her not as maid and mother love but
as on love the spirit that she worship ye ye to her she
is a goddess to be worship on whom she desir to serv with
all her heart and strength to bow down befor make offer
and at the end to follow into death so it come about that thi
nomb whose mind i thought to make as the wing of a bird
float on the air while it search for it prei ha becom
even madder than other women it is a disappoint to me
macumazahn
it mai be a disappoint to you zikali and all that you sai
is veri interest but to us it is a danger tell me will
you command nomb to ceas from her folli
will i forbid the mist to rise or the wind to blow or the
lightn to strike as she is she is her heart is fill
with black jealousi of mauriti and of you as a butcher gourd
is fill with blood for she is not on who desir that her
goddess should have other worshipp she would keep her for
herself alon
then in thi wai or in that the gourd must be empti zikali
lest we should be forc to drink from it and that black blood
should poison us
how unless it be broken macumazahn if heddana depart and
leav her she will go mad and accompani her she cannot for
her spirit dwell here and he tap hi own breast it would
pull her back again and she would becom a great troubl to me
for then that spirit of her would not suffer me to sleep with
it continu start in search of what it had lost and it
return emptyhand well have no fear for at the worst
the bowl can be broken and the blood pour upon the earth as i
have broken finer bowl than thi befor had i all the bit of
them thei would make a heap so high macumazahn and he held out
hi hand on a level with hi head a gestur that made my back
creep i will tell her thi and it mai keep her quiet for a
while of poison you need not be afraid sinc unlik mine her
spirit hate it poison is not on of it weapon as it is with
mine but of spell bewar for her spirit ha some which ar
veri power
now i jump up fill with indign sai
i do not believ in nomb spell and in ani case how am i to
guard against them
if you do not believ there is no need to guard and if you do
believ then it is for you to find out how to guard macumazahn
oh i could tell you the stori of a white teacher who did not
believ and would not guardbut never mind never mind
goodby macumazahn i will speak with nomb ask her for a
lock of her hair to wear upon your heart after she ha enchant
it the charm is good against spell ohoohoo what fool
we ar white and black togeth that is what cetewayo is
think todai
after thi nomb becam much more agreeabl that is to sai she
wa veri polit her smile wa more fix and her ey more
unfathom than ever evid zikali had spoken to her and
she had listen yet to tell the truth my distrust of thi
handsom young woman grew deeper dai by dai i recogn that
there wa a great gulf between her and the normal that she wa a
creatur fashion by zikali who had train her as a garden
train a tree nai who had done more who had graft some
foreign growth of exot and unnatur spiritu on to her
primit natur the natur remain the same but the graft or
graft bore strang flower and fruit unholi flower and
poison fruit therefor she wa not to blamesometim i
wonder whether in thi curiou world could on see their past
and their futur anybodi is to blame for anythingbut thi did
not make her the less danger
some talk i had with her onli increas my apprehens for i
found that in a wai she had no conscienc life she told me
wa but a dream and all it law as evolv by man were but
illus the real life wa elsewher there wa the distant
lake on which the flower of our true exist float without
thi unseen lake of supernatur water the flower could not
float inde there would be no flower moreov the flower did
not matter sometim it would have thi shape and colour
sometim that it wa but a thing destin to grow and bloom
and rot and dure it dai to be ugli or to be beauti to
smell sweet or ill as it might chanc and ultim to be
absorb back into the gener water of life
i point out to her that all flower had root which grew in
soil look at an orchidlik plant that crept along the bough
of a tree she answer that thi wa not true as some grew upon
air but howev thi might be the soil or the moistur in the
air wa distil from thousand of other flower live that had
flourish in their dai and been forgotten it did not matter
when thei di or how mani other flower thei choke that thei
might live yet each flower had it own spirit which alwai had
been and alwai would be
i ask her of the end and the object of that spirit she
answer darkli that she did not know and if she did would not
sai but that these were veri dread
such were some of her vagu and figur assert which i
onli record to indic their uncomfort and inde but half
human natur i forgot to add that she declar that everi
flower or life had a twin flower or life which in each
success growth it wa bound to find and bloom besid or
wither to the root and spring again and that ultim these two
would becom on and as on flourish etern of all of which
i understood and understand littl except that she had grasp
the element of some truth which she could not express in clear
and definit languag
on dai i wa seat in zikali hut whither by permiss i had
come to ask the latest new when suddenli nomb appear and
crouch down befor him

catskin kaross and ensconc myself among the beerpot and mat
in such a posit that my head over which i set a threeleg
carv stool of zikali own cut wa but a few inch to the
left of the doorhol and therefor in the deepest of the
shadow thenc by stretch out my neck a littl i could see
through the hole also hear all that pass outsid unless a
deliber search of the hut should be made i wa fairli safe
from observ even if it were enter by stranger on fear

through it i saw forti or fifti fierc and wayworn men in
front of them ride on a tire hors that wa led by a servant
wa cetewayo himself he wa assist to dismount or rather

know my case that you offend my ear with them give us food to
eat if you have it after which i would speak with you alon be
swift also here i mai not stai for long sinc the white dog
ar at my heel
i knew that you were come o king to honour my poor hous
with a visit said zikali slowli and therefor the ox is
alreadi kill and the meat will soon be on the fire meanwhil
drink a sup of beer and rest
he clap hi hand whereon nomb and some servant appear
with pot of beer of which after zikali had tast it to show
that it wa not poison the king and hi peopl drank
thirstili then it wa taken to those outsid
what is thi that my ear hear ask zikali when nomb and the
other had gone that the white dog ar on the spoor of the
black bull
cetewayo nod heavili and answer
my impi were broken to piec on the plain of ulundi the
coward ran from the bullet as children run from bee my
kraal ar burnt and i the king with but a faith remnant fly
for my life the propheci of the black on ha come true the
peopl of the zulu ar stamp flat beneath the feet of the
great white peopl
i rememb that propheci o king mopo told it to me within an
hour of the death of the black on when he gave me the littl
redhandl assegai that he snatch from the black on hand to
do the deed it make me almost young again to think of it
although even then i wa old repli zikali in a dreami voic
like on who speak to himself
hear him from under my kaross i bethought me that he had
realli grown old at last who for the moment evid forgot the
part which thi veri assegai had plai a few month befor in
the vale of bone well even the greatest master make such
slip at time when their mind ar full of other thing but if
zikali forgot cetewayo and hi councillor rememb as i
could see by the look of quick intellig that flash from
face to face
so mopo the murder he who vanish from the land after the
death of my uncl dingaan gave you the littl red assegai did
he open of road and but a few month ago that assegai
which old sigananda knew again thrown by the hand of the
inkosazanayzulu drew blood from my bodi after the white man
macumazahn had sever it shaft with hi bullet now tell me
open of road how did it pass from your keep into that of
the spirit nomkubulwana
at thi question i distinctli saw a shiver shake the frame of
zikali who realiz too late the terribl mistak he had made
yet as onli the great can do he retriev and even triumph
over hi error
ohoho he laugh who am i that i can tell how such thing
happen do you not know o king that the spirit leav what
thei will and take what thei will whether it be but a blade of
grass or the life of a manher he look at cetewayoor
even of a peopl sometim thei take the shadow and sometim
the substanc sinc spirit or matter all is their as for the
littl assegai i lost it year ago i rememb that the last
time i saw it wa in the hand of a woman name mameena to whom i
show it as a strang and bloodi thing after her death i found
that it wa gone so doubtless she took it with her to the
underworld and there gave it to the queen nomkubulwana with
whom you mai rememb thi mameena return from that underworld
yonder in the bone
it mai be so said cetewayo sullenli yet it wa no spirit
iron that cut my thigh but what do i know of the wai of
spirit wizard i would speak with you in your hut alon where
no ear can hear us
my hut is the king answer zikali yet let the king
rememb that those spirit of which he doe not know the wai
can alwai hear ye even the thought of men and on them do
judgment
fear not said cetewayo amongst mani other thing i rememb
thi also
then zikali turn and crept into the hut whisper as he
pass me
lie silent for your life and cetewayo have bidden hi
retinu to depart outsid the fenc and await him there follow
after him
thei sat them down on either side of the smoulder fire and
stare at each other through the thin smoke there in the gloom of
the hut by turn my head that the foot of the king had
brush as he pass i could watch them both cetewayo spoke
the first in a hoars slow voic sai
wizard i am in danger of my life and i have come to you who
know all the secret of thi land that you mai tell me in what
place i mai hide where the white men cannot find me it must be
told into my ear alon sinc i dare not trust the matter to ani
other at ani rate until i must thei ar traitor everi man of
them ye even those who seem to be most faith the fallen
man ha no friend least of all if he chanc to be a king
onli the dead will keep hi counsel tell me of the place i
need
dingaan who wa befor you onc ask thi same thing of me o
king when he wa fly from panda your father and the boer
i gave him advic that he did not take but sought a refug of
hi own upon a certain ghostmountain what happen to him
there that mopo of whom you spoke a while ago can tell you if
he still live
see nada the lilyeditor
sure you ar an illomen nightbird who thu croak to me
continu of the death of king broke in cetewayo with
suppress rage then calm himself with an effort ad
tell me now where shall i hide
would you know king then hearken on the south slope of the
ingom rang west of the ibululwana river on the outskirt of
the great forest there is a kloof whereof the entranc which
onli on man can pass at a time is cover by a thicket of
thorn and mark by a black rock shape like a great toad with
an open mouth or as some sai like myself
thethingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn near to thi rock
dwell an old woman blind of on ey and lack a hand which
the black on cut off shortli befor hi death becaus when he
kill her father she saw the futur and prophesi a like death
to him although then she wa but a child thi woman is of our
compani be a witchdoctoress i will send a spirit to her
if you so will it to warn her to watch for you and your compani
o king and show you the mouth of the kloof where ar some old
hut and water there you will never be found unless you ar
betrai
who can betrai me when none know whither i am go ask
cetewayo send the spirit send it at onc that thi onearm
witch mai make readi
what is the hurri king see that the forest is far awai
yet be it as you will keep silenc now lest evil should befal
you
then of a sudden zikali seem to go off into on of hi tranc
hi form grew rigid hi ey close hi face becam fix as
though in death and foam appear upon hi lip he wa a
dread sight to look on there in the gloomi hut
cetewayo watch him and shiver then he open hi blanket
and i perceiv that fasten about him by a loop of hide in such
a fashion that it could be drawn out in a moment wa the blade
of a broad assegai the shaft of which wa shorten to about six
inch hi hand grasp thi shaft and i understood that he
wa contempl the murder of zikali then it seem to me
that he chang hi mind and that hi lip shape the wordsnot
yet though whether he realli spoke them i do not know at
least he withdrew hi hand and close the blanket
slowli zikali open hi ey stare at the roof of the hut
whenc came a curiou sound as of squeak bat he look like
a dead man come to life again for a few moment he turn up
hi ear as though he listen to the squeal then said
it is well the spirit that i summon ha visit her of our
compani who is name onehand and return with the answer did
you not hear it speak in the thatch o king
i heard someth wizard answer cetewayo in an aw voic
i thought it wa a bat
a bat it is o king on with wide wing and swift thi bat
sai that my sister onehand will meet you on the third dai
from now at thi hour on the further side of the ford of the
ibululwana where three milktre grow togeth on a knoll she
will be sit under the centr milktre and will wait for two
hour no more to show you the secret entranc to the kloof
the road is rough and long i shall have to hurri when worn out
with travel said cetewayo
that is so o king therefor my counsel is that you begin the
journei as soon as possibl especi as i seem to hear the
bai of the white dog not far awai
by chaka head i will not growl cetewayo who thought to
sleep here in peac thi night
as the king will all that i have is the king onli then
onehand will not be wait and some other place of hide must
be found sinc thi is known to me onli and to her also that
spirit which i sent will make no second journei nor can i travel
to show it to the king
ye wizard it is known to you and to myself methink it
would be better were it known to me alon i have a spoon of
snuff to share ie a bone to pick with you wizard it would
seem that you set my feet and those of the zulu peopl upon a
fals road yonder in the vale of bone caus me to declar
war upon the white men and therebi bring us all to ruin
mayhap my memori grow bad o king for i do not rememb that i
did these thing i rememb that the spirit of a certain
mameena whom i call up from the dead prophesi victori to the
king which victori ha been hi also it prophesi other
victori to the king in a far land across the water which
victori doubtless shall be hi in due season for myself i gave
no counsel to the king or to hi induna and gener
you lie wizard exclaim cetewayo hoars did you not
summon the shape of the princess of heaven to be the sign of war
and did she not hold in her hand that assegai of the black on
which you have told me wa in your keep how did it pass from
your keep into the hand of a spirit
as to that matter i have spoken o king for the rest is
nomkubulwana my servant to come and go at my bid
i think so said cetewayo coldli i think also that you who
know the place where i purpos to hide would do well to forget
it sure you have live too long o open of road and done
enough evil to the hous of senzangacona which you ever hate
so he spoke and onc more i saw hi hand steal toward the
spearhead which wa hidden beneath the blanket that he wore
zikali saw it also and laugh oho he laugh forget
all my warn and that the dai of my death will be hi own
the king think to kill me becaus i am old and feebl and alon
and unarm he think to kill me as the black on thought as
dingaan thought as even panda thought yet i live on to thi
dai well i bear no malic sinc it is natur that the king
should wish to kill on who know the secret of where he would
hide himself for hi own life sake that spearhead which the
king is finger is sharp so sharp that my bare breast cannot
turn it edg i must find me a shield i must find me a
shield fire you ar not yet dead awak make smoke to be my
shield and he wave hi long monkeylik arm over the ember
from which instantli there sprang up a reek of thin white smoke
that appear to take a vagu and indefinit shape which
suggest the shadow of a man for to me it seem a nebul and
waver shadow no more
what ar you stare at o king went on zikali in a fierc and
thrill voic who is it that you see who ha the fire sent
to be my shield ghost ar so thick here that i do not know i
cannot tell on of them from the other who is it who who of
all that you have slain and who therefor ar your foe
umbelazi my brother groan cetewayo my brother umbelazi
stand befor me with spear rais he whom i brought to hi
death at the battl of the tugela hi ey flame upon me hi
spear is rais to strike he speak word i cannot understand
protect me o wizard lord of spirit protect me from the
spirit of umbelazi
zikali laugh wildli and continu to wave hi arm abov the
fire from which smoke pour ever more dens till the hut wa
full of it
when it clear awai again cetewayo wa gone
saw you ever the like of that said zikali address the
kaross under which i wa swelter tell me macumazahn
ye i answer thrust out my head as a tortois doe
when in thi veri hut you seem to produc the shape also out
of smoke i think of on whom i us to know sai how do you
do it zikali
do it who know perchanc i do noth perchanc i think
and you fool see no more or perchanc the spirit of the dead
who ar so near to us come at my call and take themselv bodi
out of the charm smoke of my fire you white men ar wise
answer your own question macumazahn at least that smoke or
that ghost save me from a spear thrust in the heart wherewith
cetewayo wa mind to pai me for show him a hidingplac
which he desir should be secret to himself alon well well
i can pai as well as cetewayo and my count is longer now lie
you still macumazahn for i go out to watch he will not bide
long in thi place which he deem haunt and illomen he
will be gone er sunset that is within an hour and sleep
elsewher
then he crept from the hut and present though i could see
noth for now the gate of the fenc wa shut i heard voic
debat and final that of cetewayo sai angrili
have done it is my will you can eat your food outsid of
thi place which is bewitch the girl will show us where ar
the hut of which the wizard speak
a few minut later zikali crept back into the hut laugh to
himself
all is safe he said and you can come out of your hole old
jackal he who call himself a king is gone take with him
those whom he think faith most of whom ar but wait a
chanc to betrai him what did i sai a king nai in all
africa there is no slave so humbl or so wretch as thi broken
man oh feather by feather i have pluck my fowl and by and by
i shall cut hi throat you will be there macumazahn you will
be there
i trust not i answer as i mop my brow we have been
near enough to throatcut thi afternoon to last me a long
while where ha the king gone
not far macumazahn i have sent nomb to guid him to the hut
in the littl dip five spear throw to the right of the mouth of
the kloof where live the old herdsman and hi peopl who guard my
cattl he and all the rest ar awai with the cattl that ar
hidden in the ceza forest out of reach of the white men so the
hut ar empti oh now i read what you ar think i do not
mean that he should be taken there it is too near my hous and
the king still ha friend
why did you send nomb i ask
becaus he would have no other guid who doe not trust my men
he mean to keep her with him for some dai and then let her go
and thu she will be out of mischief meanwhil you and your
friend can depart untroubl by her fanci and join the white
men who ar near tomorrow you shall start
that is good i said with a sigh of relief then an idea
struck me and i ad i suppos no harm will come to nomb who
might be thought to know too much
i hope not he repli indiffer but that is a matter for
her spirit to decid now go macumazahn for i am weari
i also wa weari after my prolong seclus under that veri hot
skin rug for be it rememb i wa not yet strong again and
although thi wa not the real reason why i had stop behind
when the other went to the plateau i still grew easili tire
my real reason wa that of nombethat i thought thei prefer
to be alon i look about me and saw with relief that cetewayo
and everi man of hi retinu were realli gone thei had not even
wait to eat the ox that had been kill for them but had
carri off the meat with other provis to their
sleepingplac outsid the kloof have made sure of thi i
went to my hut and loos lost that fortun enough had been
unabl to gnaw through the thick buffalohid riem with which i
had fasten him to the pole
he greet me with raptur as though we had been part for
year had he belong to ulyss himself he could not have been
more joy when on is despond and lonesom how grate
is the wholeheart welcom of a dog which we ar sometim
tempt to think is the onli creatur that realli care for us
in the world everi other live thing ha side interest of it
own but that of a dog is centr in it master though it is
true that it also dream affection of dinner and rabbit
then with lost at my feet i sat outsid the hut smoke and
wait for the return of anscomb and heda present i caught
sight of them in the gloam their arm were around on
anoth and in some remark wai thei had manag to dispos
their head forget that the sky wa still light behind them
in such fashion that it wa difficult to tell on from the other
i reflect that it wa a good thing that at last we were
escap from thi confound kloof and countri for on where
thei could marri and make an end and becam afflict with a
sneez fit
heda ask where nomb wa and why supper wa not readi for
nomb plai the part of cook and parlourmaid combin i told
her someth of what had happen whereon heda who did not
appreci it import in the least remark that she nomb
might as well have put on the pot befor she went and done sundri
other thing which i forget ultim we got someth to eat
and turn in heda grumbl a littl becaus she must sleep
alon for she had grown us to the compani of the everwatch
nomb who made her bed across the doorhol of the hut
anscomb wa soon lost in dream if he did dream but i could
not sleep well that night i wa fear of i knew not what and
so i think wa lost for he fidget and kept poke me with
hi nose at last i think it must have been about two hour
after midnight he began to growl i could hear noth
although my ear ar sharp but as he went on growl i crept to
the doorhol and drew asid the board lost slip out and
vanish while i wait listen present i thought i heard
a soft footfal and a whisper also that i saw the shape of a
woman which remind me of nomb shown faintli by the starlight
it vanish in a moment and lost return wag hi tail as he
might well have done if it were nomb who wa attach to the
dog as noth further happen i went back to bed reflect
that i wa probabl mistaken sinc nomb had been sent awai for
some dai by zikali and would scarc dare to return at onc
even if she could do so
shortli befor daylight lost began to growl again in a subdu
and thunder fashion thi time i got up and dress myself
more or less then i went out the dawn wa just break and
by it light i saw a strang scene about fifti yard awai in
the narrow nek that ran over some boulder to the site of our
hut stood what seem to be the goddess nomkubulwana as i had
seen her on the point of rock in the vale of bone she wore the
same radiant dress and in the dim glow had all the appear of
a white woman i stood amaz think that i dreamt when from
round the bend emerg a number of zulu creep forward
stealthili with rais spear
thei caught sight of the supernatur figur which bar their
road halt and whisper to each other then thei turn to
fly but befor thei went on of them as it seem to me through
sheer terror hurl hi assegai at the figur which remain
still and unmov
in thirti second thei were gone in sixti their footstep had
di awai then the figur wheel slowli round and by the
strengthen light i perceiv that a spear transfix it
breast
as it sank to the ground i ran up to it it wa nomb with her
face and arm whiten and her lifeblood run down the
glitter feather robe
chapter xxii
the mad of nomb
the dog reach nomb first and began to lick her face it
tongu remov patch of the white which had not had time to
dry she wa ly her back support by on of the boulder
with her left hand she pat the dog head feebli and with her
right drew out the assegai from her bodi let it fall upon
the ground recogn me she smile in her usual mysteri
fashion and said
all is well macumazahn all is veri well i have deserv to
die and i do not die in vain
dont talk let me see your wound i exclaim
she open her robe and point it wa quit a small gash
beneath the breast from which blood eb slowli
let it be macumazahn she said i am bleed insid and it
is mortal but i shall not die yet listen to me while i have
my mind yesterdai when mauriti and heddana went up to the plain
i wish to go with them becaus i had new that zulu were
wander everywher and thought that i might be abl to protect
my mistress from danger mauriti spoke to me roughli tell me
that i wa not want of that i thought littl for to such
word i am accustom from him moreov thei ar to be forgiven
to a man in love but it did not end there for my ladi heddana
also pierc me with her tongu which hurt more than thi spear
thrust doe macumazahn for i could see that her speech had been
prepar and that she took thi chanc to throw it at me she
said that i did not know where i should sit that i wa a thorn
beneath her nail and that whenev she wish to talk with
mauriti or with you macumazahn i wa ever there with my ear
open like the mouth of a gourd she command me in futur to
come onli when i wa call all of which thing i am sure
mauriti had taught her who in herself is too gentl even to
think themunless you taught her macumazahn
i shook my head and she went on
no it wa not you who also ar too gentl and have suffer
yourself can feel for those who suffer which mauriti who ha
never suffer cannot do still you too thought me a troubl
on that stick in the flesh like a hook thorn or a tick from
the grass and cannot be unfasten you spoke to the master
about it and he spoke to me
thi time i nod in assent
i do not blame you macumazahn inde now i see that you were
wise for what right ha a poor black doctoress to seek the love
or even to look upon the face of the great white ladi whom for a
littl while fate ha caus to walk upon the same path with her
but yesterdai i forgot that macumazahn for you see we ar all
of us not on self but mani selv and each self ha it time
of rule nomb aliv and well wa on woman nomb dy is
anoth and doubtless nomb dead will be a third unless as she
prai she should sleep for ever
macumazahn those word of heddana were to me what gall is to
sweet milk my blood clot and my heart turn sour it wa
not against her that i wa angri becaus that can never happen
but against mauriti and against you my spirit whisper in my
ear it said if mauriti and macumazahn were dead the ladi
heddana would be left alon in a strang land then she would
learn to rest upon you as upon a stick and learn to love the
stick on which she rest though it be so rough and home
but how can i kill them i ask of my spirit and myself escap
death
poison is forbidden to you by the pact between us answer my
spirit yet i will show you a wai who am bound to serv you in
all thing good or ill
then we nod to each other in my breast macumazahn and i
wait for what should happen who knew that my spirit would not
lie ye i wait for a chanc to kill you both forget as
the wick forget in their mad that even if i were not found
out soon or late heddana would guess the truth and then even if
she had learn to love me a thousand time more than she ever
could would come to hate me as a mother hate a snake that ha
slain her child or even if she never learn or guess in
life after death she would learn and hunt me and spit on me from
world to world as a traitoress and a murder on who ha sin
past pardon
here she seem to grow faint and i turn to seek for help but
she caught hold of my coat and said
hear me out macumazahn or i will run after you till i fall and
die
so think it best i stai and she went on
my spirit which must be an evil on sinc zikali gave it me
when i wa made a doctoress dealt truli with me for present
the king and hi peopl came moreov my spirit brought it
about that the king would have no other guid but me to lead him
to the kraal where he slept last night and i went as though
unwillingli at the kraal the king sent for me and question me
in a dark hut pretend to be alon but i who am a doctoress
knew that two other men were in that hut take note of all my
word he ask me of the inkosazanayzulu who appear in the
vale of bone and of the littl assegai she held in her hand and
of the magic of the open of road and mani other thing i
said that i knew noth of the inkosazana but that without
doubt my master wa a great magician he did not believ me he
threaten that i should be tortur veri horribl and wa about
to call hi servant to torment me till i told the truth then
my spirit spoke in my heart sai now the door is open to you
as i promis tell the king of the two white men whom the
master hide and he will send to kill them leav the ladi
heddana and you alon togeth so i pretend to be afraid and
told him whereon he laugh and answer
for your sake i am glad girl that you have spoken the truth
besid it is useless to tortur a witch sinc then the spirit
in her onli vomit li
next he call aloud and a man came who it wa i could not see
in the dark the king command him to take me to on of the
other hut and tie me up there to the roofpol the man obei
but he did not tie me up he onli block the hut with the
doorboard and sat with me there in the dark alon
now i grew cun and began to talk with him spread a net
of sweet word as the fowler spread a net for crane from which
he would tear the crest soon by hi talk i found out that the
king and hi peopl knew more than i guess macumazahn thei
had seen the cart which still stand under the overhang rock
by the mouth of the cave i ask him if that were all
pretend that the cart belong to my master to whom it had
been brought from the field of isandhlwana that he might be
drawn about in it who wa too weak to walk
the man said that if i would kiss him he would tell me
everyth i bade him tell me first swear that then i would
kiss him ye macumazahn i whom no man lip have ever
touch fell as low as thi so he grew foolish and told me
he told me that thei had also seen a kappj such as white women
wear hang on the hut fenc and i rememb that after
wash the headdress of my mistress i had set it there to dry in
the sun he told me also that the king suspect that she who
wore that kappj wa she who had plai the part of the
inkosazana in the vale of bone i ask him what the king would
do about the matter at the same time deni that there wa ani
white woman in the black kloof he said that at dawn the king
would send and kill these foreign rat whom the open of road
kept in the thatch of hi hut now he drew near and ask hi
pai i gave it to himwith a knifepoint macumazahn oh that
wa a good thrust he never spoke again then i slip awai
for all the other were asleep and wa here a littl after
midnight
i thought i saw you nomb i said but wa not sure so i did
noth
she smile and answer
ah i wa afraid that the watcherbynight would be watch by
night also the dog ran up to me but he knew me and i sent him
back again now while i wa come home thought enter my
heart i saw as on see by a lightn flash all that i had
done the king and hi peopl were not sure that the master wa
hide white folk here and would never have sent back to kill
them on the chanc i had made them sure as inde be mad
i meant to do moreov in throw spear at the kite i had
kill my own dove sinc it wa on the fals inkosazana who had
caus them to declar war and brought the land to ruin that
thei wish to be aveng and perchanc on him who taught her
her part not on on or two wander white men i saw that when
cetewayo peopl came and there were mani more of them outsid
sever hundr i think thei would shave the whole head and
burn the whole tree everi on in the kloof would be kill
how could i undo the knot that i had ti and stamp out the fire
that i had lit that wa the question i bethought me of come
to you but without arm how could you help i bethought me of
go to the master but i wa asham also what could he do
with but a few servant for the most of hi peopl ar awai with
the cattl he is too weak to climb the steep path to the plain
abov nor wa there time to gather folk to carri him lastli
even if there were time which there wa not and we went thither
thei would track us out and kill us for the rest i did not
care nor for myself but that the ladi heddana should be
butcher who wa more to me than a hundr live and through my
treacheryah for that i care
i call on my spirit to help me but it would not come my
spirit wa dead in me becaus now i would do good and not ill
yet anoth spirit came that of on mameena whom onc you knew
she came angrili like a storm and i shrank befor her she
said vile witch you have plot to murder macumazahn and for
that you shall answer to me befor anoth sun ha set over thi
earth of your now you seek a wai of escap from your own
wicked well it can be had but at a price
what price o ladi of death i ask
the price of your own life witch
i laugh into that ghost face of her and said
is thi all be swift and show me the wai o ladi of death
and afterward we will balanc our account
then she whisper into the ear of my heart and wa gone i ran
on for the dawn wa near i whiten myself with lime i put on
the glitter cloak and powder my hair with the sparkl
earth i took a littl stick in my hand sinc i could find no
spear and had no time to search and just as dai began to break
i crept out and stood in the bend of the path the slayer came
twelv or so of them but behind were mani more thei saw the
inkosazanayzulu bar their wai and were much afraid thei
fled but out of hi fright on of them threw a spear which went
home as i knew it would he watch to see if i should fall
but i would not fall then he fled faster than the rest know
himself accurs who had lift steel against the queen of
heaven and oh i am glad i am glad
she ceas exhaust yet with a great exult in her
beauti ey inde at that moment she look a most
triumphant creatur i stare at her thrill through and
through she had been wick no doubt but how splendid wa her
end and thank heaven she wa troubl with no thought of what
might befal her after that end although i wa sure she believ
that she would live again to face mameena
i knew not what to do i did not like to leav her especi
as no earthli power could help her case sinc slowli but quit
sure she wa bleed to death from an intern wound by now
the sun wa up and zikali peopl were about on of them
appear suddenli and saw then with a howl of terror turn to
fly awai
fool fool i cri go summon the ladi heddana and the
inkosi mauriti bid them come swiftli if thei would see the
doctoress nomb befor she di
the man leapt off like a buck and within a few minut i saw
heda and anscomb run toward us half dress and went to
meet them
what is it she gasp
i have onli time to tell you thi i answer nomb is
dy she gave her life to save you how i will explain
afterward the assegai that pierc her wa meant for your
heart go thank her and bid her farewel anscomb stop back
with me
we stood still and watch from a littl distanc heda knelt
down and put her arm about nomb thei whisper togeth into
each other ear then thei kiss
it wa at thi moment that zikali appear lean on two of hi
servant by some occult art or instinct he seem to know all
that had happen and oh he look terribl he crouch down
in front of the dy woman and toadlik spat hi venom at her
you lost your spirit did you he said well it came back to
me laden with the black honei of your treacheri to me it home
as a bee come to it hive it ha told me everyth and well
for you witch it is that you ar dy but think not that you
shall escap me there in the world below for thither i will
follow you curs on you traitress who would have betrai me
and brought all my plan to naught ow in a dai to come i will
pai you back a full harvest for thi seed of shame that you have
sown
she open her ey and look at him then answer quit
softli
i think your chain is broken o zikali no more my master i
think that love ha cut your chain in two and i fear you never
more keep the spirit you lent to me it is your but the rest
of me is my own and in the hous of my heart anoth come to
dwell
then onc more she stretch out her arm toward heda and
murmur sister forget me not sister who will await you for
a thousand year she pass awai
it wa a good end to a bad busi and i confess i felt glad
when it wa finish onli afterward i regret veri much that
i had not found an opportun to ask her whether or no she had
masquerad as mameena in the vallei of bone now it is too
late
we buri poor nomb decent in her own littl hut where she
us to practis her incant zikali and hi peopl wish
appar to throw her to the vultur for some secret reason
that had to do with their superstit but heda who now that
nomb wa dead develop a great affect for her not unmix
with a certain amount of compunct for which realli she had no
caus withstood him to hi face and insist upon a decent
inter so she wa laid to earth still plaster with the
white pigment and wrap in the bloodstain feather robe i
mai add that on the follow morn on of zikali servant
inform me solemnli that becaus of thi she had been seen
dure the night ride up and down the rock on a baboon as zulu
umtagati ar suppos to do i have small doubt that as soon as
we were gone thei dug her up again and threw her to the vultur
and the jackal accord to their first intent
on thi dai we at length escap from the black kloof and in our
own cart for dure the night our hors arriv mysteri
from somewher in good condit though rather wild i went to
sai goodby to zikali who said littl except that we should
meet onc more after mani moon anscomb and heda he would not
see at all but onli sent them a messag to the effect that he
hope thei would think kindli of him through the long year to
come sinc he had kept hi promis and preserv them safe
through mani danger i might have answer that he had first of
all put them into the danger but consid it wise to hold my
tongu i think howev that he guess my thought if on can
talk of guess in connect with zikali for he said that thei
had no reason to thank him sinc if he had serv their turn
thei had serv hi ad
it will be strang in the time to be for the ladi heddana to
rememb that it wa she and no other who crumpl up the zulu
like a frostbitten winter reed sinc had she not appear upon
the rock in the vallei of bone there would have been no war
she did not do thi you did it zikali i said make her
your tool through love and fear
nai macumazahn i did not do it it wa done by what you call
god and i call fate in whose hand i am the tool well sai to
the ladi heddana that in payment i will hold back the ghost of
nomb from haunt her if i can sai also that if i had not
brought her and her lover to zululand thei would have been
kill
so we went from that hate kloof which i have never seen sinc
and hope i shall never see again two of zikali men escort
us until we got into touch with white peopl to these we said
as littl as possibl i think thei believ that we were onli
prematur tourist who had made a dash into zululand to visit
some of the battlefield inde none of us ever report our
strang adventur and after my experi with kaatj we were
particularli care to sai noth in the hear of ani
gentleman connect with the press but as a matter of fact
there were so mani peopl move about and such a continu
come and go of soldier and their belong that after we
had manag to bui some decent cloth which we did at the
littl town of newcastl nobodi paid ani attent to us
on our wai to maritzburg on amus thing did happen we met
kaatj it wa about sunset that we were drive up a steep hill
not far from howick at least i wa drive but anscomb and
heda were walk about a hundr yard ahead of the cart when
suddenli kaatj appear over a rise and came face to face with
them while take an even stroll or as i conclud
afterward make some journei she saw she stare she
utter on wild yell and suddenli bundl over the edg of the
road never would i have believ that such a fat woman could
have run so fast in a minut she wa down the slope and had
vanish into a dens kloof where as night wa close in and we
were veri tire it wa imposs for us to follow her nor did
subsequ inquiri in howick tell us where she wa live or
whenc she came for some month befor she had left the place
she had taken there as a cook
such wa the end of kaatj so far as we were concern
doubtless to her dy dai she remain or will remain a firm
believ in ghost
anscomb and heda were marri at maritzburg as soon as the
necessari formal had been complet i could not attend the
ceremoni which wa a disappoint to me and i hope to them
but unfortun i had a return of my ill and wa laid up
for a week perhap thi wa ow to the hot sun that struck me
on the neck on afternoon come down the town hill where i wa
oblig to hang on to the rear of the cart becaus the brake had
given out howev i wa abl to send heda a wed gift in the
shape of her jewel and monei that i recov from the bank
which she had never expect to see again also to arrang
everyth about her properti
thei went down to durban for their honeymoon and some conveni
opportun aris sail thenc for england i receiv an
affection letter from them both which i still treasur
thank me veri much for all i had done for them that after all
wa littl enough also anscomb enclos a blank chequ
beg me to fill it in for whatev sum i consid he wa
indebt to me on the balanc of account i thought thi veri
kind of him and a great mark of confid but the chequ
remain blank
i never saw either of them again and though i believ that thei
ar both live for the most part abroadin hungari i thinki
do not suppos that i ever shall when i came to england some
year later after king solomon mine had made me rich i wrote
anscomb a letter he never answer it which hurt me at the
time afterward i rememb that in their fine posit it wa
veri natur that thei should not wish to renew acquaint with
an individu who had so intim a knowledg of certain
incid that thei probabl regard as hate such as the
death of marnham and dr rodd and all the surround
circumst if so i daresai that thei were wise but of
cours it mai have been onli careless it is so easi for
busi and fashion folk not to answer a rather troublesom
letter or to forget to put that answer in the post or inde
the letter mai never have reach themsuch thing often go
astrai especi when peopl live abroad at ani rate perhap
through my own fault we have drift apart i daresai thei
believ that i am dead or not to be found somewher in africa
howev i alwai think of them with affect for anscomb wa
on of the best travel companion i ever had and hi wife a
most charm girl and wonder whether zikali propheci about
their children will come true good luck go with them
as it chanc sinc then i pass the place where the templ
stood though at a littl distanc i had the curios
howev at some inconveni to ride round and examin the
spot i suppos that heda had sold the properti for a backveld
boer who wa absent at the time had turn what us to be
rodd hospit into hi hous close by grim and gaunt stood
the burntout marbl wall of the templ the verandah wa still
roof over and stand on the spot whenc i had shot the
pistol out of rodd hand i wa fill with mani memori
i could trace the whole plan of the build and visit that
part of it which had been marnham room the iron safe that
stood in the corner had been taken awai but the leg of the
bedstead remain also not far from it over grown with run
plant wa a littl heap which i took to be the ash of hi
desk for bit of burnt wood protrud i grub among them
with my foot and ride crop and present came across the
remain of a char human skull then i depart in a hurri
my wai took me through the yellowwood grove past the horn of
the blue wildebeest which still lai there past that mudhol
also into which rodd had fallen dead here howev i made no
more search who had seen enough of bone to thi dai i do not
know whether he still li beneath the slimi ooz or wa remov
and buri
also i saw the site of our wagon camp where the basuto attack
us but i will have done with these reminisc which induc
melancholi though realli there is no reason why thei should
tout lass tout cass tout passeeveryth wear out
everyth crumbl everyth vanishesin the word of the
french proverb that my friend sir henri curti is so fond of
quot that at last i wrote it down in my pocketbook onli to
rememb afterward that when i wa a boi i had heard it from the
lip of an old scamp of a frenchman of the name of leblanc who
onc gave me and anoth lesson in the gallic tongu but of
him i have alreadi written in mari which is the first chapter
in the book of the fall of the zulu that head child of
storm is the second these page form the third and last
ah inde tout lass tout cass tout pass
chapter xxiii
the kraal jazi
now i shall pass over all the zulu record of the next four year
sinc after all it ha noth to do with my tale and i do not
pretend to be write a histori
sir garnet wolselei set up hi kilkenni cat govern in
zululand or the home govern did it for him i do not know
which in place of on king thirteen chief were erect who
got to work to cut the throat of each other and of the peopl
as i expect would be the case zikali inform the militari
author of the secret hidingplac in the ingom forest where
he suggest to cetewayo that he should refug the exk wa
duli captur there and taken first to the cape and then to
england where after the disgrac of poor sir bartl frere an
agit had been set on foot on hi behalf here he saw the
queen and her minist onc more conquer as it had been
prophesi that he would by her who wore the shape of mameena at
the memor scene in the vallei of bone when i wa present
often i have thought of him dress in a black coat and seat in
that villa in melburi road in the suburb of london which i
understand is popul by artist a strang contrast truli to
the savag princ receiv the salut of triumph after the
battl of the tugela in which he won the kingship or to the
royal monarch to whose presenc i had been summon at ulundi
howev he wa brought back to zululand again by a british
manofwar reinstal to a limit chieftainship by sir
theophilu shepston and freed from the strangl embrac of
the black coat
then of cours there wa more fight as everi on knew would
happen except the british coloni offic inde all zululand
ran with blood for in england cetewayo and hi right or
wrong had like the boer and their right or wrong becom a
matter of parti polit to which everyth els must give wai
often i wonder whether parti polit will not in the end prove
the ruin of the british empir well thank heaven i shall not
live to learn
so cetewayo came back and fought and wa defeat by those who
onc had been hi subject now for the last scene that is all
with which i need concern myself
at the begin of februari 1884 busi took me to zululand
it had to do with a deal in cattl and blanket as i wa
return toward the tugela who should i meet but friend goza
he who had escort me from the black kloof to ulundi befor the
outbreak of war and who afterward escort me and that
unutter nuisanc kaatj out of the countri at first i
thought that we came togeth by accid or perhap that he had
journei a littl wai to thank me for the blanket which i had
sent to him rememb my ancient promis but afterward i
chang my opinion on thi point
well we talk over mani matter the war the disast that
had befallen zululand and so forth especi did we talk of
that night in the vallei of bone and the thing we had seen
there side by side i ask him if the peopl still believ in
the inkosazanayzulu who then appear in the moonlight on the
rock he answer that some did and some did not for hi part
he ad look at me fixedli he did not sinc it wa
rumour that zikali had dress up a white woman to plai the
part of the spirit yet he could not be sure of the matter
sinc it wa also said that when some of cetewayo peopl went
to kill thi white woman in the black kloof nomkubulwana the
princess of heaven herself rose befor them and frighten them
awai
i remark that thi wa veri strang and then quit casual
ask him whom zikali had dress up to plai the part of the dead
mameena upon that same occas sinc thi wa a point upon
which i alwai thirst for definit intellig he stare at
me and repli that i ought to be abl to answer my own question
sinc i had been much nearer to her who look like mameena than
ani on els so near inde that all present distinctli saw her
kiss me as it wa well known she had like to do while still
aliv i repli indignantli that thei saw wrong and repeat my
question then he answer straight out
o macumazahn we zulu believ that what we saw on that night
wa not nomb or anoth dress up but the spirit of the witch
mameena itself we believ it becaus we could see the light of
zikali fire through her not alwai but sometim also
becaus all that she said ha come true though everyth is not
yet finish
i could get no more out of him about the matter for when i tri
to speak of it again he turn the subject tell me of hi
wonder escap dure the war present he rose to go and
said casual
sure i grow old in these time of troubl macumazahn for
thought slip through my head like water through the finger
almost i had forgotten what i wish to sai to you the other
dai i met zikali the open of road he told me that you were
in zululand and that i should meet youh did not sai where
onli that when i did meet you i wa to give you a messag thi
wa the messagethat when on your wai to natal you came to the
kraal jazi you would find him there also anoth whom you us
to know and must be sure not to go awai without see him
sinc that wa about to happen in which you must take your part
zikali i exclaim i have heard noth of him sinc the
war i thought that by now he wa certainli dead
oh no macumazahn he is certainli not dead but just the same
as ever inde it is believ that he and no other ha kept all
thi broth of troubl on the boil some sai for cetewayo sake
and some sai becaus he wish to destroi cetewayo but what do
i know of such matter who onli desir to live in peac under
whatev chief the english queen send to us as she ha a right
to do have conquer us in war when you meet the open of
road at the kraal jazi ask him macumazahn
where the devil is the kraal jazi i inquir with irrit
i never heard of such a place
nor did i therefor i cannot tell you macumazahn for aught i
can sai it mai be down beneath where dead men go but wherev
it is there certainli you will meet the open of road now
farewel macumazahn if it should chanc that we never look
into each other ey again i am sure you will think of me
sometim as i shall of you and of all that we have seen
togeth especi on that night in the vale of bone when the
ghost of the witch mameena prophesi to us and kiss you befor
us all she must have been veri beauti macumazahn as inde
i have heard from those who rememb her and i dont wonder that
you love her so much still for my part i had rather be kiss
by a live woman than by on who is dead though doubtless it is
best to be kiss by none at all again farewel and be sure
to tell the open of road that i gave you hi messag lest he
should lai some evil charm upon me who have seen enough evil of
late
thu talk goza depart i never saw him again and do not
know if he is dead or aliv well he wa a kindli old fellow
if no hero
i had almost forgotten the incid of thi meet when a while
later i found myself in the neighbourhood of the beauti but
semitrop place call eshow which sinc those dai ha
becom the offici home of the british resid in zululand
inde although the hous wa not then finish if it had been
begun sir melmoth osborn alreadi had an offic there i wish
to see him in order to give him some rather import
inform but when i reach a kraal of about fifti hut some
five hundr yard from the site of the present resid my
wagon stuck fast in the boggi ground while i wa try to get
it out a quietfac zulu whose name i rememb wa umnikwa
inform me that malimati that is sir melmoth osborn nativ
name wa somewher at a littl distanc from eshow too far
awai for me to get to him that night i answer veri well i
would sleep where i wa and ask the name of the kraal
he repli jazi at which i start but onli said that it wa a
strang name see that it meant finish or finish with
joi umnikwa answer ye but that it had been so call
becaus the chief umfokaki or the stranger who marri a sister
of the king wa kill at thi kraal by hi brother gundan or
the bat i remark that it wa an illomen kind of name to
which the man repli ye and like to becom more so sinc
the king cetewayo who had been shelter there beneath the
armpit of malimati the white lord for some month lai in it
dy i ask him of what he wa dy and he repli that he
did not know but that doubtless the father of the witchdoctor
name zikali the open of road would be abl to tell me as
he wa attend on cetewayo
he ha sent me to bid you to come at onc o macumazahn he
ad casual have had new that you were arriv here
show no surpris i answer that i would come although
good know i wa surpris enough and leav my servant to
get my wagon out of the bog i walk into the kraal with the
messeng he took me to a larg hut place within a fenc about
the gate of which some women were gather who all look veri
anxiou and disturb among them i saw dabuko the king
brother whom i knew slightli he greet me and told me that
cetewayo wa at the point of death within the hut but like
umnikwa profess ignor of the caus of hi ill
for a long while over an hour i should think i sat there
outsid the hut or walk to and fro until dark came i
could occupi myself with contempl the sceneri of the
encircl hill which is among the most beauti in zululand
with it swell contour and rich colour but after it had
set in onli my thought remain and these i found depress
at length i made up my mind that i would go awai for after all
what had i to do with thi busi of the death of cetewayo if
in truth he wa dy i wish to see no more of cetewayo of
whom all my recollect were terrif or sorrow i rose to
depart when suddenli a woman emerg from the hut i could not
see who she wa or even what she wa like becaus of the gloom
also for the reason that she had the corner of her blanket thrown
over her face as though she wish to keep it hidden for a
moment she stop opposit to me and said
the king who is sick desir to see you macumazahn then she
point to the doorhol of the hut and vanish shut the
gate of the fenc behind her curios overcam me and i
crawl into the hut push asid the doorboard in order to do
so and set it up again when i wa through
insid burn a singl candl fix in the neck of a bottl
faintli illumin that big and gloomi place by it feebl
light i saw a low bedstead on the left of the entranc and ly
on it a man half cover by a blanket in whom i recogn
cetewayo hi face wa shrunken and distort with pain and hi
great bulk seem less but still without doubt it wa cetewayo
greet macumazahn he said feebli you find me in evil
case but i heard that you were here and thought that i should
like to see you befor i die becaus i know that you ar honest
and will report my word faithfulli i wish you to tell the
white men that my heart never realli wa against them thei have
alwai been the friend of my heart but other forc me down a
road i did not wish to travel of which now i have come to the
end
what is the matter with you king i ask
i do not know macumazahn but i have been sick for some dai
the open of road who came to doctor me becaus my wive
believ those white medicinemen wish me dead sai that i
have been poison and must die if you had been here at first
you might perhap have given me some medicin but now it is too
late he ad with a groan
who then poison you king
i cannot tell you macumazahn perhap my enemi perhap my
brother perhap my wive all wish to have done with me and
the great on who is no longer want is soon dead be
thank macumazahn that you never were a king for sad is the
lot of king
where then is the open of road i ask
he wa here a littl while ago perhap he ha gone out to take
the king head ie to announc hi death to malimati and
the white men he answer in a faint voic
just then i heard a shuffl nois proceed from that part of
the hut where the shadow wa deepest and look saw an
emaci arm project into the circl of the light it wa
follow by anoth arm then by a vast head cover with long
white hair that trail upon the ground then by a big misshapen
bodi so wast that it look like a skeleton cover with
corrug black skin slowli like a chameleon climb a
bough the thing crept forward and i knew it for zikali he
reach the side of the bed and squat down in hi toadlik
fashion then again like a chameleon without move hi head
turn hi deep and glow ey toward me
hail o macumazahn he said in hi low voic did i not
promis you long ago that you should be with me at the last and
ar you not with me and anoth
