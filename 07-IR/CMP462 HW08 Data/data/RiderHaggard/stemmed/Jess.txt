the dai had been veri hot even for the transvaal where the dai still
know how to be hot in the autumn although the neck of the summer is
brokenespeci when the thunderstorm hold off for a week or two as
thei do occasion even the succul blue liliesa varieti of the
agapanthu which is so familiar to us in english greenhouseshung their
long trumpetshap flower and look oppress and miser beneath
the burn breath of the hot wind which had been blow for hour like
the draught from a volcano the grass too near the wide roadwai
that stretch in a feebl and indetermin fashion across the veldt
fork branch and reunit like the vein on a ladi arm wa
complet coat over with a thick layer of red dust but the hot wind
wa go down now as it alwai doe toward sunset inde all that
remain of it were a few strictli local and miniatur whirlwind
which would suddenli spring up on the road itself and twist and twirl
fierc round rais a mighti column of dust fifti feet or more into
the air where it hung long after the wind had pass and then slowli
dissolv as it particl float to the earth
advanc along the road in the immedi track of on of these
desultori and inexplic whirlwind wa a man on horseback the man
look limp and dirti and the hors limper and dirtier the hot wind
had taken all the bone out of them as the kafir sai which wa
not veri much to be wonder at see that thei had been journei
through it for the last four hour without offsaddl suddenli the
whirlwind which had been travel along smartli halt and the
dust after revolv a few time in the air like a dy top slowli
began to dispers in the accustom fashion the man on the hors halt
also and contempl it in an absent kind of wai
it just like a man life he said aloud to hi hors come from
nobodi know where nobodi know why and make a littl column of dust
on the world highwai then pass awai leav the dust to fall to
the ground again to be trodden under foot and forgotten
the speaker a stout well setup rather ugli man appar on the
wrong side of thirti with pleasant blue ey and a reddish peak
beard laugh a littl at hi own sententi reflect and then gave
hi jade hors a tap with the sjambock in hi hand
come on blesbok he said or we shall never get to old croft place
tonight by jove i believ that must be the turn and he point with
hi whip to a littl rutti track that branch from the wakkerstroom
main road and stretch awai toward a curiou isol hill with a
larg flat top which rose out of the roll plain some four mile to
the right the old boer said the second turn he went on still talk
to himself but perhap he li i am told that some of them think it
is a good joke to send an englishman a few mile wrong let see thei
told me the place wa under the lee of a tabletop hill about half
an hour ride from the main road and that is a tabletop hill so i
think i will try it come on blesbok and he put the tire nag into
a sort of trippl or ambl canter much affect by south african
hors
life is a queer thing reflect captain john niel to himself as he
canter along slowli now here am i at the ag of thirtyfour about
to begin the world again as assist to an old transvaal farmer it is
a pretti end to all on ambit and to fourteen year work in the
armi but it is what it ha come to my boi so you had better make the
best of it
just then hi cogit were interrupt for on the farther side of
a gentl slope suddenli there appear an extraordinari sight over the
crest of the rise of land now some four or five hundr yard awai a
poni with a ladi on it back gallop wildli and after it with wing
spread and outstretch neck a huge cock ostrich wa speed in
pursuit cover twelv or fifteen feet at everi stride of it long
leg the poni wa still twenti yard ahead of the bird and travel
toward john rapidli but strive as it would it could not distanc the
swiftest thing on all the earth five second passedth great bird wa
close alongsid nowah and john niel turn sick and shut hi ey as
he rode for he saw the ostrich thick leg fly high into the air and
then sweep down like a lead bludgeon
thud it had miss the ladi and struck her hors upon the spine just
behind the saddl for the moment complet paralys it so that it
fell all of a heap on to the veldt in a moment the girl on it back wa
up and run toward him and after her came the ostrich up went the
great leg again but befor it could come crash across her shoulder
she had flung herself face downward on the grass in an instant the
huge bird wa on the top of her kick at her roll over her and
crush the veri life out of her it wa at thi junctur that john
niel arriv upon the scene the moment the ostrich saw him it gave up
it attack upon the ladi on the ground and began to waltz toward him
with the pompou sort of step that these bird sometim assum befor
thei give battl now captain niel wa unaccustom to the pleasant wai
of ostrich and so wa hi hors which show a strong inclin to
bolt as inde under other circumst hi rider would have been
glad to do himself but he could not abandon beauti in distress so
find it imposs to control hi hors he slip off it and with
the sjambock or hidewhip in hi hand valiantli face the enemi for
a moment or two the great bird stood still blink it lustrou round
ey at him and gentli swai it grace neck to and fro
then all of a sudden it spread out it wing and came for him like
a thunderbolt john sprang to on side and wa awar of a rustl of
rush feather and of a vision of a thick leg strike downward
past hi head fortun it miss him and the ostrich sped on like
a flash befor he could turn howev it wa back and had land
the full weight of on of it aw forward kick on the broad of hi
shoulder and awai he went headoverheel like a shot rabbit in a
second he wa on hi leg again shaken inde but not much the wors
and perfectli mad with furi and pain at him came the ostrich and at
the ostrich went he catch it a blow across the slim neck with hi
sjambock that stagger it for a moment profit by the check he
seiz the bird by the wing and held on like grim death with both hand
now thei began to gyrat slowli at first then quicker and yet more
quick till at last it seem to captain john niel that time and space
and the solid earth were noth but a revolv vision fix somewher
in the watch of the night abov him like a stationari pivot tower
the tall grace neck beneath him spun the toplik leg and in front
of him wa a soft black and white mass of feather
thud and a cloud of star he wa on hi back and the ostrich which
did not seem to be affect by giddi wa on him punish him
dreadfulli luckili an ostrich cannot kick a man veri hard when he is
flat on the ground if he could there would have been an end of john
niel and hi stori need never have been written
half a minut or so pass dure which the bird work hi sweet will
upon hi prostrat enemi and at the end of it the man began to feel
veri much as though hi earthli career wa close just as thing were

voic cry

just as he finish hi stori thei reach the top of the rise over
which the ostrich had pursu bessi croft and saw a kafir come
toward them lead the poni with on hand and captain niel hors
with the other about twenti yard behind the hors a ladi wa walk
ah said bessi theyv caught the hors and here is jess come to
see what is the matter
by thi time the ladi in question wa quit close so that john wa abl
to gather a first impress of her she wa small and rather thin with
quantiti of curl brown hair not by ani mean a love woman
as her sister undoubtedli wa but possess two veri remark
characteristicsa complexion of extraordinari and uniform pallor and a
pair of the most beauti dark ey he had ever look on altogeth
though her size wa almost insignific she wa a strikinglook
person with a face few men would easili forget befor he had time to
observ ani more the two parti had met
what on earth is the matter bessi jess said with a quick glanc
at her sister companion and speak in a low full voic with just
a slight south african accent that is take enough in a pretti woman
thereon bessi broke out with a histori of their adventur appeal to
captain niel for confirm at interv
meanwhil jess croft stood quit still and silent and it struck john
that her face wa the most singularli impass on he had ever seen it
never chang even when her sister told her how the ostrich roll on
her and nearli kill her or how thei final subdu the foe dear
me he thought to herself what a veri strang woman she cant have
much heart but just as he thought it the girl look up and then he
saw where the express lai it wa in those remark ey immov
as wa her face the dark ey were alight with life and a suppress
excit that made them shine glorious the contrast between the
shine ey and the impass face beneath them struck him as so
extraordinari as to be almost uncanni as a matter of fact it wa
doubtless both unusu and remark
you have had a wonder escap but i am sorri for the bird she said
at last
why ask john
becaus we were great friend i wa the onli person who could manag
him
ye put in bessi the savag brute would follow her about like a
dog it wa just the oddest thing i ever saw but come on we must be
get home it grow dark moutiwhich be interpret mean
medicinesh ad address the kafir in zuluhelp captain niel
on to hi hors be care that the saddl doe not twist round the
girth mai be loos
thu adjur john with the help of the zulu clamber into hi
saddl an exampl that the ladi quickli follow and thei set off onc
more through the gather dark present he becam awar that thei
were pass up a drive border by tall blue gum and next minut the
bark of a larg dog which he afterward knew by the name of stomp
and the sudden appear of light window told him that thei had
reach the hous at the dooror rather opposit to it for there
wa a verandah in frontthei halt and got off their hors as thei
dismount there came a shout of welcom from the hous and present
in the doorwai show out clearli against the light appear a
strike and in it wai a most pleasant figur hefor it wa a
manwa veri tall or rather he had been veri tall now he wa much
bent with ag and rheumat hi long white hair hung low upon hi
neck and fell back from a promin brow the top of the head wa
quit bald like the tonsur of a priest and shone and glisten in the
lamplight and round thi oasi the thin white lock fell down the
face wa shrivel like the surfac of a wellkept appl and like
an appl rosi red the featur were aquilin and strongli mark the
eyebrow still black and veri bushi and beneath them shone a pair
of grei ey keen and bright as those of a hawk but for all it
sharp there wa noth unpleas or fierc about the face on
the contrari it wa pervad by a remark air of goodnatur and
pleasant shrewd for the rest the man wa dress in rough tweed
cloth tall ridingboot and held a broadbrim boer hunt hat in
hi hand such as john niel first saw him wa the outer person of old
sila croft on of the most remark men in the transvaal
is that you captain niel roar out the stentorian voic the

far had been nearli silent sat down at the piano she did not do
thi willingli inde for it wa not until her patriarch uncl had
insist in hi ring cheeri voic that she should let captain niel
hear how she could sing that she consent but at last she did consent
and then after let her finger strai somewhat aimlessli along the
chord she suddenli broke out into such song as john niel had never
heard befor her voic beauti as it wa wa not what is known as
a cultiv voic and it wa a german song therefor he did not
understand it but there wa no need of word to translat it burden
passion despair yet hope through despair echo in it everi
line and love unend love hover over the gloriou notesnai
possess them like a spirit and made them hi up up rang her wild
sweet voic thrill hi nerv till thei answer to the music as an
aeolian harp answer to the wind on went the song with a divin sweep
like the sweep of rush pinion higher yet higher it soar lift
up the listen heart far abov the world on the trembl wing
of soundai even higher till the music hung at heaven gate and
fall thenc swiftli as an eagl fall quiver and wa dead
john sigh and so strongli wa he move sank back in hi chair

quickli and then with an abrupt goodnight she left the room
the old man smile jerk the stem of hi pipe over hi shoulder after
her and wink in a wai that no doubt meant unutter thing but
which did not convei much to hi astonish guest who sat still and
said noth then bessi rose and bade him goodnight in her pleasant
voic and with housewif care inquir as to whether hi room wa to
hi tast and how mani blanket he like upon hi bed tell him that
if he found the odour of the moonflow which grew near the verandah
too strong he had better shut the righthand window and open that on
the other side of the room then at length with a piquant littl nod of
her golden head she went off look john thought as he watch

as though he had been well beaten and then wrap up tight in
horsegirth he made shift howev to dress himself and then with
the help of a stick limp through the french window that open from
hi room on to the verandah and survei the scene befor him it wa
a delight spot at the back of the stead wa the steep boulderstrewn
face of the flattop hill that curv round on each side embosom
a great slope of green in the lap of which the hous wa place it
wa veri solidli built of brown stone and with the except of the
waggonsh and other outbuild which were roof with galvanis
iron that shone and glisten in the rai of the morn sun in a wai
that would have made an eagl blink wa cover with rich brown thatch
all along it front ran a wide verandah up the trelliswork of which
green vine and bloom creeper trail pleasantli and beyond wa the
broad carriagedr of red soil border with bushi orangetre laden
with odor flower and green and golden fruit on the farther side
of the orangetre were the garden fenc in with low wall of rough
stone and the orchard plant with standard fruittre and beyond
these again the oxen and ostrich kraal the latter full of longneck
bird to the right of the hous grew thrive plantat of bluegum
and black wattl and to the left wa a broad stretch of cultiv
land ly so that thei could be irrig for winter crop by mean
of water led from the great spring that gush out of the mountainsid
high abov the hous and gave it name of mooifontein to the place
all these and mani more thing john niel saw as he look out from the
verandah at mooifontein but for the moment at ani rate thei were lost
in the wild and wonder beauti of the panorama that roll awai for
mile and mile at hi feet till it wa bound by the mighti rang of
the drakensberg to the left tip here and there with snow and by the
dim and vast horizon of the swell transvaal plain to the right and
far in front of him it wa a beauti sight and on to make the blood
run in a man vein and hi heart beat happili becaus he wa aliv
to see it mile upon mile of grasscloth veldt beneath bend and
rippl like a cornfield in the quick breath of the morn space
upon space of deepblu sky overhead with neer a cloud to dim it and
the swift rush of the wind between then to the left there impress
to look on and conduc to solemn thought the mountain rear their
crest against the sky and crown with the gather snow of the
centuri whose monument thei ar from aeon to aeon gaze majest
out over the wide plain and the ephemer antlik race who tread
them and while thei endur think themselv the master of their littl
world and over allmountain plain and flash streamth gloriou
light of the african sun and the spirit of life move now as it onc
move upon the darkl water
john stood and gaze at the untam beauti of the scene in hi mind
compar it to mani cultiv prospect which he had known and come
to the conclus that howev desir the presenc of civilis man
might be in the world it could not be said that hi oper realli
add to it beauti for the old line natur unadorn adorn the
most still remain true in more sens than on
present hi reflect were interrupt by the step of sila
croft which notwithstand hi ag and bent frame still rang firm
enoughand he turn to greet him
well captain niel said the old man up alreadi it look well if
you mean to take to farm ye it a pretti view and a pretti place
too well i made it twentyf year ago i rode up here and saw thi
spot look you see that rock there behind the hous i slept under it
and woke at sunris and look out at thi beauti scene and at the
great veldt it wa all aliv with game then and i said to myself
sila for fiveandtwenti year have you wander about thi great
countri and now you ar get tire of it youv never seen a fairer
spot than thi or a healthier be a wise man and stop here and so i
did i bought the 3000 morgen 6000 acr more or less for 10
pound down and a case of gin and i set to work to make thi place and
you see i have made it ay it ha grown under my hand everi stone and
tree of it and you know what that mean in a new countri but on wai
or anoth i have done it and now i have grown too old to manag it
and that how i came to give out that i want a partner as mr snow
told you down in durban you see i told snow it must be a gentleman i
dont care much about the monei ill take a thousand for a third share
if i can get a gentlemannon of your boer or mean white for me i
tell you i have had enough of boer and their wai the best dai of my
life wa when old shepston ran up the union jack there in pretoria and
i could call myself an englishman onc more lord and to think that
there ar men who ar subject of the queen and want to be subject of
a republ againmad captain niel i tell you quit mad howev
there an end of it all now you know what sir garnet wolselei told
them in the name of the queen up at the vaal river that thi countri
would remain english until the sun stood still in the heaven and the
water of the vaal ran backward that good enough for me for as
i tell these grumbl fellow who want the land back now that we have
paid their debt and defeat their enemi no english govern is
fals to it word or break engag solemnli enter into by it
repres we leav that sort of thing to foreign no no
captain niel i would not ask you to take a share in thi place if i
wasnt sure that it would remain under the british flag but we will
talk of all thi anoth time and now come in to breakfast
a factauthor
after breakfast as john wa far too lame to walk about the farm the
fair bessi suggest that he should come and help her to wash a batch
of ostrich feather and accordingli off he went the locu operandi
wa in a space of lawn at the rear of a littl clump of naatch
orangetre of which the fruit is like that of the maltes orang
onli larger here were place an ordinari washingtub halffil with
warm water and a tin bath full of cold the ostrich feather mani of
which were complet coat with red dirt were plung first into the
tub of warm water where john niel scrub them with soap and then
transfer to the tin bath where bessi rins them and laid them on
a sheet in the sun to dry the morn wa veri pleasant and john soon
came to the conclus that there ar mani more disagre occup
in the world than the wash of ostrich feather with a love girl to
help you for there wa no doubt but that bessi wa love look a
veri type of happi healthi womanhood as she sat opposit to him on the
littl stool her sleev roll up almost to the shoulder show
a pair of arm that would not have disgrac a statu of venu and
laugh and chat awai as she wash the feather now john niel wa
not a suscept man he had gone through the fire year befor and
burnt hi finger like mani anoth confid youngster but all the
same he did wonder as he knelt there and watch thi fair girl who
somehow remind him of a rich rosebud burst into bloom how long
it would be possibl to live in the same hous with her without fall
under the spell of her charm and beauti then he began to think of jess
and of what a strang contrast the two were
where is your sister he ask present
jess oh i think that she ha gone to the lion kloof read or
sketch i dont know which you see in thi establish i repres
labour and jess repres intellect and she nod her head prettili
at him and ad there is a mistak somewher she got all the
brain
ah said john quietli and look up at her i dont think that you
ar entitl to complain of the wai in which natur ha treat you
she blush a littl more at the tone of hi voic than the word and
went on hastili jess is the dearest best and cleverest woman in the
whole worldther i believ that she ha onli on fault and it is
that she think too much about me uncl said that he had told you how
we came here first when i wa eight year old well i rememb that
when we lost our wai on the veldt that night and it rain so and wa
so cold jess took off her own shawl and wrap it round me over my
own well it ha been just like that with her alwai i am alwai to
have the shawleveryth is to give wai to me but there that is jess
all over she is veri cold cold as a stone i sometim think but when
she doe care for anybodi it is enough to frighten on i dont know a
great number of women but somehow i do not think that there can be mani
in the world like jess she is too good for thi place she ought to go
awai to england and write book and becom a famou woman onli
she ad reflect i am afraid that jesss book would all be sad
on
just then bessi stop talk and suddenli chang colour the bunch
of lank wet feather she held in her hand drop from it with a littl
splash back into the bath follow her glanc john look down the
avenu of bluegum tree and perceiv a big man with a broad hat and
mount on a splendid black hors canter leisur toward the
hous
who is that miss croft he ask
it is a man i dont like she said with a littl stamp of her foot
hi name is frank muller and he is half a boer and half an englishman
he is veri rich and veri clever and own all the land round thi
place so uncl ha to be civil to him though he doe not like him
either i wonder what he want now
on came the hors and john thought that it rider wa go to pass
without see them when suddenli the movement of bessi dress
between the naatch tree caught hi ey and he pull up and look
round he wa a larg and exceedingli handsom man appar about
forti year old with clearcut featur cold lightblu ey and a
remark golden beard that hung down over hi chest for a boer he
wa rather smartli dress in englishmad tweed cloth and tall
ridingboot
ah miss bessi he call out in english there you ar with your
pretti arm all bare im in luck to be just in time to see them shall
i come and help you to wash the feather onli sai the word now
just then he caught sight of john niel check himself and ad
i have come to look for a black ox brand with a heart and a w
insid of the heart do you know if your uncl ha seen it on the place
anywher
no meinheer muller repli bessi coldli but he is down there
point at a kraal on the plain some halfmil awai if you want to go
and ask about it
mr muller said he by wai of correct and with a curiou
contract of the brow meinheer is veri well for the boer but
we ar all englishmen now well the ox can wait with your permiss
ill stop here till oom croft uncl croft come back and without
further ado he jump off hi hors and slip the rein over it
head as an indic to it to stand still advanc toward bessi with
an outstretch hand as he came the young ladi plung both her arm
up to the elbow in the bath and it struck john who wa observ the
scene close that she did thi in order to avoid the necess of
shake hand with her stalwart visitor
sorri my hand ar wet she said give him a cold littl nod let
me introduc you mr with emphasi frank mullercaptain nielwho
ha come to help my uncl with the place
john stretch out hi hand and muller shook it
captain he said interrogativelya ship captain i suppos
no said john a captain of the english armi
oh a rooibaatj red jacket well i dont wonder at your take to
farm after the zulu war
i dont quit understand you said john rather coldli
oh no offenc captain no offenc i onli meant that you
rooibaatj did not come veri well out of that war i wa there with
piet ui and it wa a sight i can tell you a zulu had onli to show
himself at night and on would see your regiment skreck stamped
like a span of oxen when thei wind a lion and then theyd fireah
thei did fireanyhow anywher but mostli at the cloud there wa no
stop them and so you see i thought that you would like to turn
your sword into a ploughshar as the bibl saysbut no offenc im
sureno offenc
all thi while john niel be english to hi backbon and cherish
the reput of hi profess almost as dearli as hi own honour
wa boil with inward wrath which wa all the fiercer becaus he knew
there wa some truth in the boer insult he had the sens howev
to keep hi temperoutwardli at ani rate
i wa not in the zulu war mr muller he said and just then old
sila croft rode up and the convers drop
mr frank muller stop to dinner and far on into the afternoon for
hi lost ox seem to have entir slip hi memori there he sat
close to the fair bessi smoke and drink ginwat and talk
with great volubl in english sprinkl with boerdutch term that
john niel did not understand and gaze at the young ladi in a manner
which john somehow found unpleas of cours it wa no affair of hi
and he had no interest in the matter but for all that he thought thi
remarkablelook dutchman exceedingli disagre at last inde
he could bear it no longer and hobbl out for a littl walk with jess
who in her abrupt wai offer to show him the garden
you dont like that man she said to him as thei went slowli down the
slope in front of the hous
no do you
i think repli jess quietli but with much emphasi that he is
the most odiou man i ever sawand the most curiou then she relaps
into silenc onli broken now and again by an occasion remark about
the flower and tree
half an hour afterward when thei arriv again at the top of the
slope mr muller wa just ride off down the avenu of blue gum by
the verandah stood a hottentot name jantj who had been hold the
dutchman hors he wa a curiou wizenedup littl fellow dress
in rag and with hair like the worn tag of a black woollen carpet
hi ag might have been anyth between twentyf and sixti it wa
imposs to form ani opinion on the point just now howev
hi yellow monkei face wa convuls with an express of intens
malign and he wa stand there in the sunshin curs rapidli
beneath hi breath in dutch and shake hi fist after the form of the
retreat boera veri epitom of impot but overmast passion
what is he do ask john
jess laugh and answer jantj doe not like frank muller ani more
than i do but i dont know why he will never tell me
chapter iv
bessi is ask in marriag
in due cours john niel recov from hi sprain ankl and the other
injuri inflict on him by the infuri cock ostrich it is by the
wai a humili thing to be knock out of time by a feather fowl
and set to work to learn the routin of farm life he did not find thi
a disagre task especi when he had so fair an instructress as
bessi who knew all about it to show him the wai in which he should
go natur of an energet and hardwork tempera he veri soon
fell more or less into the swing of the thing and at the end of six
week began to talk quit learnedli of cattl and ostrich and sweet
and sour veldt about onc a week or so bessi us to put him through
a regular examin as to hi progress also she gave him lesson in
dutch and zulu both of which tongu she spoke to perfect so
it will be seen that john did not lack for pleasant and profit
employ also as time went on he grew much attach to sila croft
the old gentleman with hi handsom honest face hi larg and vari
stock of experi and hi sturdi english charact made a great
impress on hi mind he had never met a man quit like him befor
nor wa thi friendship unreciproc for hi host took a wonder
fanci to john niel
you see my dear he explain to hi niec bessi he is quiet and
he doesnt know much about farm but he will to learn and such
a gentleman now where on ha kafir to deal with as on a place
like thi you must have a gentleman your mean white will never get
anyth out of a kafir that why the boer kill them and flog them
becaus thei cant get anyth out of them without but you see captain
niel get on well enough with the boi i think hell do my dear
i think hell do and bessi quit agre with him and so it came to
pass that after thi six week trial the bargain wa struck final
and john paid over hi thousand pound becom the owner of a third
interest in mooifontein
now it is not possibl in a gener wai for a man of john niel ag
to live in the same hous with a young and love woman like bessi
croft without run more or less risk of entangl especi
is thi so when the two peopl have littl or no outsid societi or
distract to divert their attent from each other not that there
wa at ani rate as yet the slightest hint of affect between them
onli thei like on anoth veri much and found it pleasant to be a
good deal togeth in short thei were walk along that easi wind
road which lead to the mountain path of love it is a veri broad road
like anoth road that run elsewher and also like thi last it ha
a wide gate sometim too it lead to destruct but for all that
it is a most agreeabl on to follow handinhand wind as it doe
through the pleasant meadow of companionship the view is rather
limit it is true and homelikeful of familiar thing there stand
the kine kneedeep in grass there run the water and there grow
the corn also you can stop if you like byandbi it is differ
byandbi when the travel tread the height of passion precipic
will yawn and torrent rush lightn will fall and storm will blind
and who can know that thei shall attain at last to that faroff peak
crown with the glori of a perfect peac which men call happi
there ar those who sai it never can be reach and that the halo which
rest upon it slope is no earthli light but rather as it were a
promis and a beacona glow reflect whenc we know not and ly on
thi alien earth as the sun light li on the dead bosom of the moon
some declar again that thei have climb it topmost pinnacl
and tast of the fresh breath of heaven which sweep around it
heightsai and heard the quir of immort harp and the swanlik
sigh of angel wing and then behold a mist ha fallen upon them and
thei have wander in it and when it clear thei were on the mountain
path onc more and the peak wa far awai and a few there ar who tell
us that thei live there alwai listen to the voic of god but
these ar old and worn with journeyingmen and women who have outliv
passion and ambit and the fire heat of love and who now girt
about with memori stand face to face with the sphinx etern
but john niel wa no chicken nor veri like to fall in love with the
first pretti face he met he had onc year ago gone through that
melancholi stage and there he thought wa an end of it moreov if
bessi attract him so did jess in a differ wai befor he had
been a week in the hous he came to the conclus that jess wa the
strangest woman he had ever met and in her own fashion on of the most
attract her veri impass ad to her charm for who is there
in thi world who is not eager to learn a secret to him jess wa
a riddl of which he did not know the kei that she wa clever and
wellinform he soon discov from her rare remark that she could
sing like an angel he also knew but what wa the mainspr of her
mindround what axi did it revolvethi wa the puzzl clearli
enough it wa not like most women least of all like that of happi
healthi plainsail bessi so curiou did he becom to fathom these
mysteri that he took everi opportun to associ with her and
when he had time would even go out with her on her sketch or rather
flowerpaint expedit on these occas she would sometim
begin to talk but it wa alwai about book or england or some
intellectu question she never spoke of herself
yet it soon becam evid to john that she like hi societi and
miss him when he did not come it never occur to him what a boon
it wa to a girl of consider intellectu attain and still
greater intellectu capac and aspir to be thrown for the
first time into the societi of a cultiv and intellig gentleman
john niel wa no emptyhead onesid individu he had both read
and thought and even written a littl and in him jess found a mind
which though of an inferior stamp wa more or less kindr to her own
although he did not understand her she understood him and at last had
he but known it there rose a faroff dawn light upon the twilight
of her heart that thrill and chang it as the first faint rai of
morn thrill and chang the dark of the night what if she should
learn to love thi man and teach him to love her to most women such a
thought more or less involv the idea of marriag and that chang of
statu which for the most part thei consid desir but jess did not
think much of that what she did think of wa the bless possibl of
be abl to lai down her life as it were in the life of anotherof
at last find somebodi who understood her and whom she could
understand who would cut the shackl that bound down the wing of
her geniu so that she could rise and bear him with her as in bulwer
lytton beauti stori zoe would have born her lover here at length
wa a man who understood who wa someth more than an anim and
who possess the godlik gift of brain the gift that had been a
curs rather than a bless to her lift her abov the level of
her sex and shut her off as by iron door from the comprehens of
those around her ah if onli thi perfect love of which she had read
so much would come to him and her life might perhap grow worth the
live
it is a curiou thing but in such matter most men never learn wisdom
from experi a man of john niel ag might have guess that it
is danger work plai with explos and that the quietest most
harmlesslook substanc ar sometim the most explos he might
have known that to set to work to cultiv the societi of a woman with
such telltal ey as jesss wa to run the risk of catch the fire
from them himself to sai noth of set her alight he might have
known that to bring all the weight of hi cultiv mind to bear on her
mind to take the deepest interest in her studi to implor her to let
him see the poetri bessi told him she wrote but which she would
show to no live soul and to evinc the most evid delight in her
sing were on and all hazard thing to do yet he did them and
thought no harm
as for bessi she wa delight that her sister should have found
anybodi to whom she care to talk or who could understand her it never
occur to her that jess might fall in love jess wa the last person
to fall in love nor did she calcul what the result might be to
john as yet at ani rate she had no interest in captain nielof
cours not
and so thing went on pleasantli enough to all concern in thi drama
till on fine dai when the stormcloud began to gather john had been
about the farm as usual till dinner time after which he took hi gun
and told jantj to saddl up hi shoot poni he wa stand on the
verandah wait for the poni to appear and by him wa bessi look
particularli attract in a white dress when suddenli he caught sight
of frank muller great black hors and upon it that gentleman himself
canter up the avenu of blue gum

thu and if the gun had not then arriv he would to a certainti run
in and flush the bird thi wa a rule that he never broke for hi
patienc had a fix limit on thi occas howev john arriv
befor it wa reach and jump off hi poni cock hi gun and
march slowli up full of happi expect on drew the dog hi ey
cold and fix saliva drop from hi mouth and hi head on
which wa frozen an extraordinari express of instinct feroc
outstretch to it utmost limit
pontac wa under the mimosa thorn now and up to hi belli in the warm
red grass where could the bird be whirr and a great feather
shell seem to have burst at hi veri feet what a covei twelv brace
if there wa a bird and thei had all been ly beak to beak in a space
no bigger than a cart wheel up went john gun and off too a littl
sooner than it should have done
miss him clean now then for the left barrel same result we will
draw a veil over the profan that ensu a minut later and it wa
all over and john and pontac were regard each other with mutual
contempt and disgust
it wa all you you brute said john to pontac i thought you were
go to run in and you hurri me
ugh said pontac to john or at least he look it ugh you
disgust bad shot what is the good of point for you it enough
to make a dog sick
the coveyor rather the collect of old bird for thi kind of
partridg sometim pack just befor the breed seasonhad
scatter all about the place it wa not long befor pontac found some
of them and thi time john got on birda beauti great partridg he
wa too with yellow legsand miss anoth again pontac point and
a brace rose bang down goe on bang with the other barrel caught
him by jove just as he top the stone hullo pontac is still on the
point slip in two more cartridg oh a leash thi time bang bang
and down come a brace of themtwo brace of partridg without move a
yard
life ha joi for all men but i verili believ it ha no joi to
compar to that of the moder shot and earnest sportsman when he
ha just kill half a dozen driven partridg without a miss or ten
rocket pheasant with eleven cartridg or better still a coupl
of woodcock right and left sweet to the politician ar the cheer
that announc the triumph of hi caus and of himself sweet to the
despond writer is the unexpect public recognit by review of
talent with which previous nobodi had been much impress sweet to
all men ar the light of women ey and the touch of women lip but
though he have experienc all these thing to the true sportsman and
the moder shot sweeter far is it to see the arch wing of the
driven bird bent like cupid bow come flash fast toward him to
feel the touch of the stock as it fit itself against hi shoulder
and the kindli give of the trigger and then oh thrill sight to
perceiv the wonder and yet aw chang from life to death the puff
of feather and the hurtl passag of the dull mass born onward by
it own forc to fall twenti yard from where the pellet struck it
next session the politician will be hoot down next year perhap
the review will cut the happi writer to ribbon and decor their
journal with hi fragment next week you will have weari of those
dear smile or more like still thei will be bestow elsewher
vaniti of vaniti my son each and all of them but if you ar a true
sportsman ye even though you be but a moder shot it will alwai
be a gloriou thing to go out shoot and when you chanc to shoot
well earth hold no such joi as that which will glow in your honest
breast for all sportsmen ar honest and it remain to be prove if
heaven doe either it is a grand sport though the piti of it is that
it should be a cruel on
such wa the paean that john sang in hi heart as he contempl those
fine partridg befor lovingli transfer them to hi bag but hi
luck todai wa not destin to stop at partridg for hardli had he
ridden over the edg of the boulderstrewn side and on to the flat
tabletop of the great hill which cover some five hundr acr of
land befor he perceiv emerg from the shelter of a tuft of grass
about a hundr and seventi yard awai noth less than the tall neck
and whisker head of a larg pauw or bustard
now it is quit useless to try and ride straight up to a bustard and
thi he knew the onli thing to do is to excit hi curios and fix
hi attent by move round and round him in an evernarrow circl
put hi poni to a canter john proceed to do thi with a heart
beat with excit round and round he went the pauw had
vanish now he wa squat in the tuft of grass the last circl
brought him to within seventi yard and he did not dare to ride ani
nearer so jump off hi poni he ran in toward the bird as hard as he
could go when he had cover ten pace the pauw wa rise but thei
ar heavi bird and he wa within forti yard befor it wa fairli on
the wing then he pull up and fire both barrel of no 4 into it
down it came and incauti man he rush forward in triumph without
reload hi gun alreadi wa hi hand outstretch to seiz the prize
when behold the great wing spread themselv out and the bird wa
fly awai john stood danc upon the veldt but observ that it
settl within a coupl of hundr yard he ran back mount hi poni
and pursu it as he drew near it rose again and flew thi time
a hundr yard onli and so it went on till at last he got within
gunshot of the king of bird and kill it
by thi time he wa across the mountaintop and on the brink of the
most remark chasm he had ever seen the place wa known as lion
kloof or leeuwen kloof in dutch becaus three lion had onc been
pen up by a parti of boer and shot there thi chasm or gorg wa
between a quarter and half a mile long about six hundr feet in width
and a hundr and fifti to a hundr and eighti feet deep evid it
ow it origin to the action of run water for at it head just to
the right of where john niel stood a littl stream well from hidden
spring in the flat mountaintop trickl from stratum to stratum
form a seri of crystal pool and tini waterfal till at last it
reach the bottom of the mighti gorg and pursu it wai through
it to the plain beyond halfhidden by the umbrellatop mimosa and
other thorn that were scatter about without doubt thi littl stream
wa the parent of the ravin it trickl down and through but wonder
john niel how mani centuri of patient neverceas flow must
have been necessari to the vast result befor him first centuri
of satur of the soil pile on and between the bed rock that lai
beneath it and jut up through it then centuri of flood caus
by rain and perhap by melt snow to carri awai the loosen mould
then centuri upon centuri more of flow and of rainfal to wash
the debri clean and complet the coloss work
i sai the rock that jut up through the soil for the kloof wa not
clean cut all along it side and here and there in it arena stood
mighti column or finger of rock not solid inde but form by huge
boulder pile mason fashion on upon anoth as though the titan of
some dead ag had emploi themselv in build them up overcom
their tendenc to fall by the mere crush weight abov that kept them
steadi even when the wild breath of the storm came howl down the
gorg and tri it strength against them about a hundr pace from
the near end of the chasm some nineti or more feet in height rose
the most remark of these giant pillar to which the remain at
stoneheng ar but as toi it wa form of seven huge boulder the
largest that at the bottom about the size of a moder cottag
and the smallest that at the top perhap some eight or ten feet in
diamet these boulder were round like a cricketballevid
through the action of waterand yet the hand of natur had contriv
to balanc them each on smaller than that beneath the on upon
the other and to keep them so but thi wa not alwai the case for
instanc a veri similar mass which onc stood on the near side of the
perfect pillar had fallen all except it two foundat stone and
the rock that form it lai scatter about like monstrou petrifi
cannonbal on of these had split in two and seat on it look
veri small and far off at the bottom of that vast gulf john discov
jess croft appar engag in sketch
he dismount from hi shoot poni and look about him perceiv
that it wa possibl to descend by follow the cours of the stream
and clamber down the natur step it had cut in it rocki bed
throw the rein over the poni head and leav him with the dog
pontac to stand and stare about him as south african shoot poni
ar accustom to do he laid down hi gun and game and proceed to
descend paus everi now and again to admir the wild beauti of the
scene and examin the hundr varieti of moss and fern the last
mostli of the maidenhair capillu veneri genu that cloth everi
cranni and everi rock where thei could find foothold and win refresh
from the water or the sprai of the cascad as he drew near the bottom
of the gorg he saw that on the border of the stream wherev the soil
wa moist grew thousand upon thousand of white arum pig lili as
thei call them in africa which were now in full bloom he had notic
these lili from abov but thenc ow to the distanc thei seem
so small that he took them for everlast or anemon john could not
see jess now for she wa hidden by a bush that grow on the bank of
the stream in south africa in lowli land and which at certain
season of the year is complet cover with mass of the most
gorgeou scarlet bloom hi footstep fell veri softli on the moss
and flower and when he pass round the gloriouslook bush it wa
evid that she had not heard him for she wa asleep her hat wa
off but the bush shade her and her head had fallen forward over
her sketch block and rest upon her hand a rai of light that came
through the bush plai over her curl brown hair and threw warm
shadow on her white face and the whiter wrist and hand by which it wa
support
john stood there and look at her and the old curios took
possess of him to understand thi feminin enigma mani a man befor
him ha been the victim of a like desir and live to regret that he
did not leav it ungratifi it is not well to try to lift the curtain
of the unseen it is not well to call to heaven to show it glori or
to hell to give us touch and knowledg of it yawn fire knowledg
come soon enough mani of us will sai that knowledg ha come too soon
and left us desol there is no bitter like the bitter of
wisdom so cri the great koheleth and so hath cri mani a son of man
follow blindli on hi path let us be thank for the dark place
of the earthplac where we mai find rest and shadow and the heavi
sweet of the night seek not after mysteri o son of man be
content with the practic and the prove and the broad light of dai
peep not mutter not the word of awaken understand her who would be
understood and is comprehens to those that run and for the other
let them be lest your fate should be as the fate of ev and as the
fate of lucif star of the morn for here and there beat a human
heart from which it is not wise to draw the veila heart in which mani
thing ar dim as halfrememb dream in the brain of the sleeper
draw not the veil whisper not the word of life in the silenc where all
thing sleep lest in that kindl breath of love and pain pale shape
aris take form and fright you
a minut or so might have pass when suddenli and with a littl start
jess open her great ey wherein the shadow of dark lai and
gaze at him
oh she said with a littl tremor is it you or is it my dream
dont be afraid he answer cheerfulli it is iin the flesh
she cover her face with her hand for a moment then withdrew it and
he notic that her ey had chang curious in that moment thei were
still larg and beauti as thei alwai were but there wa a chang
just now thei had seem as though her soul were look through them
doubtless it wa becaus the pupil had been enlarg by sleep
your dream what dream he ask laugh
never mind she answer in a quiet wai that excit hi curios
more than ever it wa about thi kloofand youbut dream ar
foolish
chapter vi
the storm break
do you know you ar a veri odd person miss jess john said
present with a littl laugh i dont think you can have a happi
mind
she look up a happi mind she said who can have a happi mind
nobodi who feel suppos she went on after a pausesuppos on
put oneself and on own littl interest and joi and sorrow quit
awai how is it possibl to be happi when on feel the breath of human
miseri beat on on face and see the tide of sorrow and suffer
creep up to on feet you mai be on a rock yourself and out of the
path of it till the spring flood or the hurrican wave come to sweep
you awai or you mai be afloat upon it whichev it is it is quit
imposs if you have ani heart to be indiffer
then onli the indiffer ar happi
ye the indiffer and the selfish but after all it is the same
thing indiffer is the perfect of selfish
i am afraid that there must be lot of selfish in the world for
certainli there is plenti of happi all evil thing notwithstand
i should have said that happi spring from good and a sound
digest
jess shook her head as she answer i mai be wrong but i dont
see how anybodi who feel can be quit happi in a world of sick
suffer slaughter and death i saw a kafir woman die yesterdai and
her children cry over her she wa a poor creatur and had a rough
lot but she love her life and her children love her who can be
happi and thank god for hi creation when he ha just seen such a thing
but there captain niel my idea ar veri crude and i dare sai veri
wrong and everybodi ha thought them befor at ani rate i am not
go to inflict them on you what is the us of it and she went
on with a laugh what is the us of anyth the same old thought
pass through the same human mind from year to year and centuri to
centuri just as the same cloud float across the same blue sky the
cloud ar born in the sky and the thought ar born in the brain and
thei both end in tear and rearis in blind bewild mist and thi
is the begin and end of thought and cloud thei aris out of the
blue thei overshadow and break into storm and tear then thei ar
drawn up into the blue again and the stori begin afresh
so you dont think that on can be happi in thi world he ask
i did not sai thati never said that i do think that happi is
possibl it is possibl if on can love somebodi so hard that on can
quit forget oneself and everyth els except that person and it
is possibl if on can sacrific oneself for other there is no true
happi outsid of love and selfsacrific or rather outsid of love
for it includ the other thi is gold and all the rest is gilt
how do you know that he ask quickli you have never been in love
no she answer i have never been in love like that but all the
happi i have had in my life ha come to me from love i believ
that love is the secret of the world it is like the philosoph stone
thei us to look for and almost as hard to find but if you find it
it turn everyth to gold perhap she went on with a littl laugh
when the angel depart from the earth thei left us love behind that
by it and through it we mai climb up to them again it is the on thing
that lift us abov the brute without love man is a brute and noth
but a brute with love he draw near to god when everyth els fall
awai the love will endur becaus it cannot die while there is ani life
if it is true love for it is immort onli it must be trueyou see it
must be true
he had penetr her reserv now the ic of her manner broke up
beneath the warmth of her word and her face usual impass had
caught life and light from the ey abov and acquir a certain beauti
of it own john look at it and understood someth of the untaught
and illregul intens and depth of the natur of thi curiou
girl he met her ey and thei move him strang though he wa not
an emot man and wa too old to experi spasmod thrill at the
chanc glanc of a pretti woman he move toward her look at her
curious
it would be worth live to be love like that he said more to
himself than to her
jess did not answer but she let her ey rest on hi inde she did
more for she put her soul into them and gaze and gaze till john niel
felt as though he were mesmeris and as she gaze there rose up in her
breast a knowledg that if she will it she could gain thi man heart
and hold it against all the world for her natur wa stronger than hi
natur and her mind untrain though it be encompass hi mind and
could pass over it and beat it down as the wind beat down the toss
sea all thi she learnt in a moment in the twinkl of an ey she
could not tell how she knew it but she did know it as sure as she
knew that the blue sky stretch overhead and what is morefor the
moment at ani rateh knew it too thi strang strong certainti came
on her as a shock and a revel like the tide of some great joi
or grief and for a moment left her heart empti of all thing els
jess drop her ey suddenli
i think she said quietli that we have been talk a great deal of
nonsens and that i want to finish my sketch
he rose and left her for he wa want at home sai as he went that
he thought there wa a storm come up the air wa so quiet and the
wind had fallen as it doe befor an african tempest present on
look round she saw him slowli climb the precipit ascent to the
tableland abov the gulf
it wa on of those gloriou afternoon that sometim come in the
african spring although it wa so intens still everywher appear
the proof of evid of life the winter wa over and now from
the sad and steril of it wither ag sprang youth and love
summer clad in sunshin bediamond with dew and fragrant with the
breath of flower jess lai back and look up into the infinit depth
abov how blue thei were and how measureless she could not see the
angri cloud that lai like visibl omen on the horizon look there
mile abov her wa on tini circl speck it wa a vultur watch
her from hi airi height and descend a littl to see if she were
dead or onli sleep
involuntarili she shudder the bird of death remind her of death
himself also hang high up yonder in the blue and wait hi
opportun to fall upon the sleeper then her ey fell upon a bough of
the gloriou flower bush under which she rest it wa not more than
four feet abov her head but she lai so still and motionless that a
jewel honeysuck came and hover over the flower dart from on
to anoth like a manycolour flash thenc her glanc travel to
the great column of boulder that tower abov her and that seem to
sai i am veri old i have seen mani spring and mani winter and
have look down on mani sleep maid and where ar thei now
all deadal dead and an old baboon in the rock with startl
sudden bark out all dead in answer
around her were the bloom lili and the lusti of spring life
the heavi air wa sweet with the odour of fern and the mimosa flower
the run water splash and music fell the sunlight shot in
golden bar athwart the shade like the memori of happi dai in the
grei vista of a life awai in the cliff yonder the rockdov were
prepar to nest by hundr and wake the silenc with their coo
and the flutter of their wing even the grim old eagl perch on
the pinnacl of the peak wa prune himself contentedli happi in
the knowledg that hi mate had laid an egg in that dark corner of the
cliff all thing rejoic and cri aloud that summer wa at hand and
that it wa time to bloom and love and nest soon it would be winter
again when thing di and next summer other thing would live under
the sun and these perchanc would be forgotten that wa what thei
seem to sai
and as jess lai and heard her youth blood drawn by natur
magnet forc as the moon draw the tide rose in her vein like the
sap in the bud tree and stir her virgin seren all the
bodili natur part of her caught the tone of natur happi voic that
bade her break her bond live and love and be a woman and lo the
spirit within her answer to it fling wide her bosom door and
of a sudden as it were someth quicken and live in her heart that
wa of her and yet had it own lifea life apart someth that sprang
from her and anoth which would alwai be with her now and could
never die she rose pale and trembl as a woman trembl at the first
stir of the child that she shall bear and clung to the floweri
bough of the beauti bush abov then sank down again feel that
the spirit of her girlhood had depart from her and anoth angel had
enter there know that she love with heart and soul and bodi and
wa a veri woman
she had call to love as the wretch call to death and love had come
in hi strength and possess her utterli and now for a littl while
she wa afraid to pass into the shadow of hi wing as the wretch
who call to death fear him when thei feel hi ici finger but the fear
pass and the great joi and the new conscious of power and of
ident that the inspir of a true passion give to some strong
deep natur remain and after a while jess prepar to make her wai
home across the mountaintop feel as though she were anoth be
still she did not go but lai there with close ey and drank of thi
new intox wine so absorb wa she that she did not notic
that the dove had ceas to call and that the eagl had fled awai for
shelter she wa not awar of the great and solemn hush which had taken
the place of the merri voic of beast and bird and preced the break
of the gather storm
at last as she rose to go jess open her dark ey which for the most
part had been shut while thi great chang wa pass over her and
with a natur impuls turn to look onc more on the place where her
happi had found her then sank down again with a littl exclam
where wa the light and the glori and all the happi of the life that
move and grew around her gone and in it place dark and rise
mist and deep and omin shadow while she lai and thought the sun
had sunk behind the hill and left the great gulf nearli dark and as is
common in south africa the heavi stormcloud had crept across the blue
sky and seal the light from abov a drear wind came moan up the
gorg from the plain beyond the heavi raindrop began to fall on
by on the lightn flicker fitfulli in the belli of the advanc
cloud the storm that john had fear wa upon her
then came a dread hush jess had recov herself by now and
know what to expect she snatch up her sketchingblock and hurri
into the shelter of a littl cave hollow by water in the side of the
cliff and now with a rush of icecold air the tempest burst down came
the rain in a sheet then flash upon flash gleam fierc through the
vapourladen air and roar upon roar echo along the rocki caviti in
volum of fear sound then anoth paus and space of utter silenc
follow by a blaze of light that daze and blind her and suddenli
on of the piledup column to her left swai to and fro like a poplar
in a breez to fall headlong with a crash which almost master the
aw crackl of the thunder overhead and the shriek of the baboon
scare from their cranni in the cliff down it rush beneath the
stroke of that fieri sword the brave old pillar that had last out so
mani centuri send cloud of dust and fragment high up into the
blind rain and carri aw and wonder to the heart of the girl who
watch it fall awai roll the storm as quickli as it had come with
a sound like the pass of the artilleri of an embattl host then a
grei rain set in blot the outlin of everyth like an endless
absorb grief dull the edg and temper of a life through it jess
scare and wet to the skin manag to climb up the natur step now
made almost impass by the prevail gloom and the rush of water
from the tabletop of the mountain and on across the sodden plain down
the rocki path on the farther side past the littl walledin cemeteri
with the four red gum plant at it corner in which a stranger who
had di at mooifontein lai buri and so just as the dark of the
wet night came down like a cloud home at last at the backdoor stood
her old uncl with a lantern
is that you jess he call out in hi stentorian tone lord what
a sight as she emerg her sodden dress cling to her slight form
her hand torn with clamber over the rock her curl hair which
had broken loos hang down her back and half cover her face
lord what a sight he ejacul again why jess where have you
been captain niel ha gone out to look for you with the kafir
i have been sketch in leeuwen kloof and got caught in the storm
there uncl let me pass i want to take these wet thing off it is
a bitter night and she ran to her room leav a long trail of water
behind her as she pass the old man enter the hous shut the door
and blew out the lantern
now what is it she remind me of he said aloud as he grope hi wai
down the passag to the sittingroom ah i know that night when she
first came here out of the rain lead bessi by the hand what can the
girl have been think of not to see the thunder come up she ought
to know the sign of the weather here by now dream i suppos
dream she an odd woman jess veri perhap he did not quit know
how accur hi guess wa and how true the conclus he drew from it
certainli she had been dream and she wa an odd woman
meanwhil jess wa rapidli chang her cloth and remov the trace
of her struggl with the element but of that other struggl she had
gone through she could not remov the trace thei and the love that
aros out of it would endur as long as she endur it wa her former
self that had been cast off in it and which now lai behind her an empti
and unmean thing like the shapeless heap of garment it wa all veri
strang so john had gone to look for her and had not found her she wa
glad that he had gone it made her happi to think of him search
and call in the wet and the night she wa onli a woman and it wa
natur that she should feel thu byandbi he would come back and find
her cloth and in her right mind and readi to greet him she wa glad
that he had not seen her wet and dishevel a girl look so unpleas
like that it might have set him against her men like women to look
nice and clean and pretti that gave her an idea she turn to her
glass and hold the light abov her head studi her own face
attent she wa a woman with as littl vaniti in her composit as
it is possibl for a woman to have and till now she had not given her
person look much consider thei had not been of great import
to her in the wakkerstroom district of the transvaal but tonight all
of a sudden thei becam veri import and so she stood and look at
her own wonder ey at the mass of curl brown hair still damp
and shine from the rain at the curiou pallid face and clearcut
determin mouth
if it were not for my ey and hair i should be veri ugli she said
to herself aloud if onli i were beauti like bessi now the
thought of her sister gave her anoth idea what if john were to prefer
bessi now she rememb that he had been veri attent to bessi
a feel of dread doubt and jealousi pass through her for women
like jess know what jealousi is in it bitter suppos that it wa
in vain suppos that what she had given todaygiven utterli onc
and for all so that she could not take it backhad been given to a man
who love anoth woman and that woman her own dear sister suppos
that the fate of her love wa to be like water fall unalteringli
on the hard rock that heed it not and retain it not true the water
wear the rock awai but could she be satisfi with that she could
master him she knew even if thing were so she could win him to
herself she had read it in hi ey that afternoon but could she who
had promis to her dead mother to cherish and protect her sister whom
till thi dai she had love better than anyth in the world and
whom she still love more dearli than her lifecould she if it should
happen to be thu rob that sister of her lover and if it should be so
what would her life be like it would be like the great pillar after the
lightn had smitten it a pile of shatter smoke fragment a veri
heapedup debri of a life she could feel it even now no wonder then
that jess sat there upon the littl white bed hold her hand against
her heart and feel terribl afraid
just then she heard john footstep in the hall

and if he doe not marri me i think that it will break my heart there
that the truth jess dear and she drop her golden head on to her
sister knee and began to cry softli at the thought
but the sister sat there on the chair her hand hang idli by her
side her white face set and impass as that of an egyptian sphinx
and the larg ey gaze far awai through the window against which the
rain wa beatingfar awai out into the night and the storm she heard
the surg of the storm she heard her sister weep her ey
perceiv the dark squar of the window through which thei appear to
look she could feel bessi head upon her kneey she could see
and hear and feel and yet it seem to her that she wa dead the
lightn had fallen on her soul as it fell on the pillar of rock and
it wa as the pillar is and it had fallen so soon there had been
such a littl span of happi and hope and so she sat like a stoni
sphinx and bessi wept softli befor her like a beauti breath
love human suppliant and the two form a pictur and a contrast
such as the student of human natur doe not often get the chanc of
studi
it wa the eldest sister who spoke first after all

you i think that you have made a veri wise choic captain niel is a
man whom ani woman might love and be proud of love
in anoth minut she wa in her room and there her composur left her
for she wa but a love woman after all she flung herself upon her
bed and hide her face in the pillow burst into a paroxysm of
weepinga veri differ thing from bessi gentl tear her grief
absolut convuls her and she push the bedcloth against her
mouth to prevent the sound of it penetr the partit wall and
reach john niel ear for hi room wa next to her even in the
midst of her suffer the thought of the ironi of the thing forc
itself into her mind there separ from her onli by a few inch of
lath and plaster and some four or five feet of space wa the man for
whom she mourn thu and yet he wa as ignor of it as though he
were thousand of mile awai sometim at such acut crise in our
live the limit of our physic natur do strike us after thi
fashion it is strang to be so near and yet so far and it bring the
absolut and utter loneli of everi creat be home to the mind
in a manner that is forcibl and at time almost terribl john niel
sink composedli to sleep hi mind happi with the recollect of
those two right and left shot and jess ly on her bed six feet
awai and sob out her stormi heart over him ar inde but type of
what is continu happen in thi remark world how often do we
understand on anoth grief and when we do by what standard can
we measur it more especi is comprehens rare if we chanc to
be the origin caus of the troubl do we think of the feel of the
beetl it is our pain duti to crush into nothing not at all if
we have ani compunct thei ar quickli absorb in the pride of our
captur and more often still as in the present case we set our foot
upon the poor victim by pure accid or venial careless
present john wa fast asleep and jess her paroxysm past wa
walk up and down down and up her littl room her bare feet
fall noiselessli on the carpet as she strove to wear out the first
bitter of her woe oh that it lai in her power to recal the past
few dai oh that she had never seen hi face which must now be ever
befor her ey but for her there wa no such possibl and she felt
it she knew her own natur well her heart had spoken and the word it
said must roll on continu through the space of her mind who can
recal the spoken word and who can set a limit on it echo it is not
so with most women but here and there mai be found a natur where it is
so spirit like thi poor girl ar too deep and partak too much
of a divin immut to shift and suit themselv to the chang
circumst of a fickl world thei have no middl cours thei cannot
halt halfwai thei set all their fortun on a throw and when the throw
is lost their heart ar broken and their happi pass awai like a
swallow
for in such a natur love rise like the wind on the quiet breast of
some far sea none can sai whenc it come or whither it blow but
there it is lash the water to a storm so that thei roll in thunder
all the long dai through throw their white arm on high as thei
clasp at the evas air till the dark that is death come down and
cover them
what is the interpret of it why doe the great wind stir the
deep water it doe but rippl the shallow pool as it pass for
shallow can but rippl and throw up shadow we cannot tell but
thi we knowthat deep thing onli can be deepli move it is the
penalti of depth and great it is the price thei pai for the
divin privileg of suffer and sympathi the shallow pool the
lookingglass of our littl life know nought feel nought poor
thing thei can but rippl and reflect but the deep sea in it
tortur mai perchanc catch some echo of god voic sound down the
driven gale and as it lift itself and toss it wave in agoni mai
perceiv a glow flow from a celesti sky that is set beyond the
horizon that bound it be
suffer or rather mental suffer is a prerog of great
and even here there li an exquisit joi at it core for everyth
ha it compens nerv such as these can thrill with a high
happi that will sweep unfelt over the mass of men thu he who is
stricken with grief at the sight of the world miserya all great and
good men must bei at time lift up with joi by catch some faint
gleam of the almighti purpos that underli it so it wa with the son
of man in hi darkest hour the spirit that enabl him to compass out
the measur of the world suffer and sin enabl him also know
their purpos to gaze beyond them and thu it is too with those
deepheart children of hi race who partak howev dimli of hi
divin
thu even in thi hour of her darkest bitter and grief a gleam
of comfort struggl to jesss breast just as the first rai of dawn wa
struggl through the stormi night she would sacrific herself to her
sisterthat she had determin on and henc came that cold gleam
of happi for there is happi in selfsacrific whatev the
cynic mai sai at first her woman natur had risen in rebellion
against the thought why should she throw her life awai she had as good
a right to thi man as bessi and she knew that by the strength of her
own hand she could hold him against bessi in all her beauti howev
far thing had gone between them and she believ as a jealou woman
is prone to do that thei had gone much farther than wa the case
but byandbi as she pursu that weari march her better self rose up
and master the prompt of her heart bessi love him and bessi
wa weaker than she and less suit to bear pain and she had sworn to
her dy motherfor bessi had been her mother darlingto promot
her happi and come what would to comfort and protect her by everi
mean in her power it wa a wide oath and she wa onli a child when
she took it but it bound her conscienc none the less and sure it
cover thi besid she dearli love herfar far more than she
love herself no bessi should have her lover and she should never
know what it had cost her to give him up and as for herself well she
must go awai like a wound buck and hide till she got wellor di
she laugh a drear littl laugh and stai to brush her hair just as
the broad light of the dawn came stream across the misti veldt but
she did not look at her face again in the glass she care no more
about it now then she threw herself down to sleep the sleep of utter
exhaust befor it wa time to go out again and face the world and her
new sorrow

chapter viii
jess goe to pretoria
that dai at dinner jess suddenli announc that she wa go on the
morrow to pretoria to see jane nevil
to see jane nevil said bessi open her blue ey wide why
it wa onli last month you said that you did not care about jane nevil
now becaus she had grown so vulgar dont you rememb when she
stop here on her wai down to natal last year and held up her fat
hand and said ah jessjess is a geniu it is a privileg to
know her and then she ask you to quot shakespear to that lump of
a brother of her and you told her that if she did not hold her tongu
she would not enjoi the privileg much longer and now you want to go
and stop with her for two month well jess you ar odd and what
more i think it is veri unkind of you to run awai for so long
to all of which prattl jess said noth but mere reiter her
determin to go
john too wa astonish and to tell the truth not a littl
disgust sinc the previou dai when he had that talk with her in
lion kloof jess had assum a clearer and more definit interest in hi
ey befor that she wa an enigma now he had guess enough about her
to make him anxiou to know more inde he had not perhap realis
how strong and definit hi interest wa till he heard that she wa
go awai for a long period suddenli it struck him that the farm would
be veri dull without thi veri fascin woman move about the
place in her silent resolut wai bessi wa no doubt delight
and charm to look on but she had not her sister brain and
origin and john niel wa suffici abov the ordinari run to
thoroughli appreci intellect and origin in a woman instead of
stand aghast at it she interest him intens to sai the least of
it and manlik he felt exceedingli annoi and even sulki at
the idea of her departur he look at her in protest and with an
awkward begotten of hi irrit knock down the vinegar cruet
and made a mess upon the tabl but she evad hi ey and took no
notic of the vinegar then feel that he had done all that in him
lai he went to see about the ostrich first of all hang about a
littl in case jess should come out which she did not do inde he
saw noth more of her till supper time bessi told him that she said
she wa busi pack but as on can onli take twenti pound weight of
luggag in a postcart thi did not quit convinc him that it wa so
in fact
at supper jess wa if possibl even more quiet than she had been
at dinner after it wa over he ask her to sing but she declin
sai that she had given up sing for the present and persist
in her statement in spite of the choru of remonstr it arous the
bird onli sing whilst thei ar mate and it is by the wai a curiou
thing and suggest of the theori that the same great principl
pervad all natur that now when her troubl had overtaken her
and that she had lost the love which had suddenli sprung from her
heartfullgrown and clad in power as athena sprang from the head of
jovejess had no further inclin to us her divin gift of song
probabl it wa noth more than a coincid although a strang on
the arrang wa that on the morrow jess wa to be driven in the
cape cart to martinuswesselstroom more commonli call wakkerstroom
there to catch the postcart which wa time to leav the town at
middai though when it would leav wa quit anoth matter postcart
ar not particular to a dai or so in the transvaal
old sila croft wa to drive her with bessi who wish to do some
shop in wakkerstroom as ladi sometim will but at the last
moment the old man felt a premonitori twing of the rheumat to which
he wa a martyr and could not go so of cours john volunt and
though jess rais some difficulti bessi further the idea and in
the end hi offer wa accept
accordingli at halfpast eight on a beauti morn up came the
tent cart with it two massiv wheel stout stinkwood disselboom
and four spirit young hors to the head of which the hottentot
jantj assist by the zulu mouti clad in the sweet simplic of a
moocha a few feather in hi wool and a horn snuffbox stuck through
the fleshi part of the ear hung on grimli in thei gotjohn first
then bessi next to him then jess next jantj scrambl up behind and
after some preliminari back and plung and show a disposit
to twine themselv affection round the orangetre off went
the hors at a hand gallop and awai swung the cart after them in a
fashion that would have frighten anybodi not accustom to that mode
of progress pretti well out of hi wit as it wa john had as much
as he could do to keep the four hors togeth and to prevent them
from bolt and thi alon to sai noth of the rattl and jolt
of the vehicl over the uneven track wa suffici to put a stop to
ani attempt at convers
wakkerstroom is about eighteen mile from mooifontein a distanc that
thei cover well within the two hour here the hors were outspan
at the hotel and john went into the hous whenc the postcart wa
to start and book jesss seat and then join the ladi at the
kantoor or store where thei were shop when their purchas were
made thei went back to the inn togeth and at some dinner by which
time the hottentot driver of the cart began to tune up lustili but
unmelodi on a bugl to inform intend passeng that it wa
time to start bessi wa out of the room at the moment and with the
except of a peculiarli dirtylook cooli waiter there wa nobodi
about
how long ar you go to be awai miss jess ask john
two month more or less captain niel
i am veri sorri that you ar go he said earnestli it will be
dull at the farm without you

window and affect to watch the inspan of the postcart in the
yard on to which it look

felt curious drawn toward her and wa anxiou to show it
never mind me she said with an impati littl movement bessi
is sweet enough and love enough to be look after for her own sake i
should think
befor he could sai ani more in came bessi herself sai that the
driver wa wait and thei went out to see her sister off
dont forget your promis jess whisper to him bend down as he
help her into the cart so low that her lip almost touch him and
her breath rest for a second on hi cheek like the ghost of a kiss
in anoth moment the sister had embrac each other tenderli enough
the driver had sound onc more on hi aw bugl and awai went the
cart at full gallop bear with it jess two other passeng and
her majesti mail john and bessi stood for a moment watch it
mad career as it fled splash and bang down the straggl street
toward the wide plain beyond then thei turn to enter the inn again
and prepar for their homeward drive at that moment an old boer name
han coetze with whom john wa alreadi slightli acquaint came
up and extend an enorm big and thick hand bid them gooden
daag han coetze wa a veri favour specimen of the better sort
of boer and realli came more or less up to the ideal pictur that is so
often drawn of that simpl pastor peopl he wa a veri larg stout

few british regiment when he wa astonish by a sudden chang in hi
friend manner drop hi enorm paw on to hi shoulder coetze

surround by the aforesaid crowd stood frank muller a heavi
sjambock in hi rais hand as though in the act to strike befor

the swartsel black creatur ha stolen my hors forag and given
it to your shout muller who wa evid almost off hi head with
rage make an attempt to hit jantj with the whip as he spoke the
latter avoid the blow by jump behind john with the result that the
tip of the sjambock caught the englishman on the leg
be care sir with that whip said john to muller restrain hi
temper with difficulti now how do you know that the man stole your

my father and told him to look after them as though thei were hi
children but the oxen were bewitch three of them took the lungsick
and di a lion got on a snake got on and on at tulip and di
too so when oom jacob came back the next year all the oxen were gone
he wa veri angri with my father and beat him with a yokestrap till he
wa all blood and though we show him the bone of the oxen he said
that we had stolen them and sold them
now oom jacob had a beauti span of black oxen that he love like
children sixteen of them there were and thei would come up to the yoke
when he call them and put down their head of themselv thei were
tame as dog these oxen were thin when thei came down but in two

time there wa a basutu on of sequati peopl rest in our hut
for he had hurt hi foot with a thorn when oom jacob found that the

but we could not find them then oom jacob went mad with rage and
the young baa frank told him that on of the kafir boi had said to him

next morn when we were asleep just at daybreak oom jacob muller
and baa frank and two kafir came into the hut and pull us out the
old man my uncl my father my mother and myself and ti us up to
four mimosatre with buffalohid reim then the kafir went awai
and oom jacob ask my father where the cattl were and my father
told him that he did not know then oom jacob took off hi hat and
said a prayer to the big man in the sky and when he had done baa frank
came up with a gun and stood quit close and shot my father dead and he
fell forward and hung quiet over the reim hi head touch hi feet
then he load the gun again and shot the old man my uncl and he
slip down dead and hi hand stuck up in the air against the reim
next he shot my mother but the bullet did not kill her and cut the
reim and she ran awai and he ran after her and kill her when that
wa done he came back to shoot me but i wa young then and did not
know that it is better to be dead than to live like a dog and i cri
and prai for merci while he wa load the gun
but the baa onli laugh and said he would teach hottentot how to
steal cattl and old oom jacob prai out loud to the big man and
said he wa veri sorri for me but it wa the dear lord will and

thei were full and tire of be alon oom jacob turn quit white

dear lord for save my life and just then the englishwoman baa
frank mother came down from the waggon to see what the fire wa at
and when she saw all the peopl dead and me weep ti to the tree
and learnt what it wa about she went quit mad for sometim she had
a kind heart when she wa not drunk and said that a curs would fall on
them and that thei would all die in blood and she took a knife and cut
me loos though baa frank want to kill me so that i might tell no

veri much frighten till i reach natal and there i stop work
in natal till thi land becam english when baa croft hire me to
drive hi cart up from maritzburg and live by here i found baa
frank look bigger but just the same except for hi beard
there baa that is the truth and all the truth and that is why
i hate baa frank becaus he shot my father and mother and why baa
frank hate me becaus he cannot forget that he did it and becaus i
saw him do it for as our peopl sai on alwai hate a man on ha

ghastli tale seem to be beyond comment thei never doubt it truth
the man wai of tell it carri convict with it inde two of
them at ani rate had heard such stori befor most peopl have who

taken for gospel
you sai remark old sila at last that the englishwoman said that
a curs would fall on them and that thei would die in blood she wa
right twelv year ago oom jacob and hi wife were murder by a
parti of mapoch kafir down on the edg of that veri lydenburg veldt

so said the hottentot without show the slightest interest or
surpris i knew it would be so but i wish i had been there to see it
i saw that there wa a devil in the woman and that thei would die as
she said when there is a devil in peopl thei alwai speak the truth
becaus thei cant help it look baa i draw a circl in the sand with
my foot and i sai some word so and at last the end touch there

a rough scotch cart to which were har two of the best hors at
mooifontein to shoot buck at han coetze
he reach the place at about halfpast eight and conclud from the
fact of the presenc of sever cart and hors that he wa not the
onli guest inde the first person whom he saw as the cart pull up
wa hi late enemi frank muller
kek look baa said jantj there is baa frank talk to hi
servant hendrik that ugli basutu with on ey
john as mai be imagin wa not best pleas at thi meet he had
alwai dislik the man and sinc muller conduct on the previou
fridai and jantj stori of the dark deed of blood in which he had
been the princip actor posit he loath the sight of him he
jump out of the cart and wa go to walk round to the back of the
hous in order to avoid him when muller suddenli seem to becom
awar of hi presenc advanc to meet him with the utmost cordial
how do you do captain he said hold out hi hand which john just
touch so you have come to shoot buck with oom coetze go to
show us transvaal how do to it eh there captain dont look as
stiff as a rifl barrel i know what you ar think of that littl
busi at wakkerstroom on fridai is it not well now i tell you
what it is i wa in the wrong and i am not afraid to sai so as between
man and man i had had a glass that wa the fact and did not quit
know what i wa about we have got to live as neighbour here so let us
forget all about it and be brother again i never bear malic not i
it is not the lord will that we should bear malic hit out from the
shoulder i sai and then forget all about it if it hadnt been for
that littl monkei he ad jerk hi thumb in the direct
of jantj who wa hold the hors head it would never have
happen and it is not nice that two christian should quarrel about
such as he
muller jerk out thi long speech in a success of sentenc
someth as a schoolboi repeat a hardli learnt lesson fidget hi
feet and let hi restless ey travel about the ground as he spoke
it wa evid to john who stood quit still and listen to it in ici
silenc that hi address wa by no mean extemporari clearli it had
been compos for the occas
i do not wish to quarrel with anybodi meinheer muller he answer
at length i never do quarrel unless it is forc on me and then
he ad grimli i do my best to make it unpleas for my enemi the
other dai you attack first my servant and then myself i am glad that
you now see that thi wa an improp thing to do and so far as i am
concern there is an end of the matter and he turn to enter the
hous
muller accompani him as far as where jantj wa stand at the
hors head here he stop and put hi hand in hi pocket
took out a twoshil piec and threw it to the hottentot call to
him to catch it
jantj wa hold the hors with on hand in the other he held hi
sticka long walk kerri that he alwai carri the same on which
he had shown bessi the notch in order to secur the piec of monei
he drop the stick and muller quick ey catch sight of the
notch beneath the knob he stoop down pick it up and examin
it
what do these mean boi he ask point to the line of big and
littl notch some of which had evid been cut year ago
jantj touch hi hat spat upon the scotchman as the nativ of
that part of africa call a twoshil piec and pocket it befor
he answer the fact that the giver had murder all hi near relat
did not make the gift less desir in hi ey hottentot moral sens
is not veri elev
becaus onc upon a time a scotchman made a great
impress on the simpl nativ mind in natal by palm off
some thousand of florin among them at the nomin valu of
half a crown
no baa he said with a curiou grin that is how i reckon if
anybodi beat jantj jantj cut a notch upon the stick and everi
night befor he goe to sleep he look at it and sai on dai you will
strike that man twice who struck you onc and so on baa look what
a line of them there ar baa on dai i shall pai them all back again
baa frank
muller abruptli drop the stick and follow john toward the hous
it wa a much better build than the boer gener indulg in and
the sittingroom though innoc of flooringunless clai and cowdung
mix can be call a floorwa more or less cover with mat made of
springbuck skin in the centr of the room stood a tabl made of
the pretti buckenhout wood which ha the appear of have been
industri prick all over with a darningneedl and round it were
chair and couch of stinkwood and seat with rimpi or strip of
hide
in on big chair at the end of the room busili emploi in do
noth sat tanta aunt coetze the wife of old han a larg and
weighti woman who evid had onc been rather handsom and on
the couch were some halfdozen boer their rifl in their hand or
between their knee
it struck john as he enter that some of these did not seem best
pleas to see him and he thought he heard on young fellow with
a hangdog express of face mutter someth about the damn
englishman to hi neighbour rather more loudli than wa necessari to
convei hi sentiment howev old coetze came forward to greet him
heartili enough and call to hi daughterstwo fine girl veri
smartli dress for dutch womento give the captain a cup of coffe
then john made the round after the boer fashion and begin with the
old ladi in the chair receiv a lymphat shake of the hand from everi
singl soul in the room thei did not riseit is not customari to do
sothei mere extend their paw all of them more or less damp and
mutter the mystic monosyl daag short for gooddai it is
a veri try ceremoni till on get us to it and john pull up
pant to be present with a cup of hot coffe that he did not want
but which it would be rude not to drink
the captain is the rooibaatj said the old ladi aunt coetze
interrog and yet with the certainti of on who state a fact
john signifi that he wa
what doe the captain come to the land for is it to spy
the whole audienc listen attent to their hostesss question
then turn their head to listen for the answer
no i have come to farm with sila croft
there wa a gener smile of incredul could a rooibaatj farm
certainli not
there ar three thousand men in the british armi announc the old
vrouw oracularli and cast a sever glanc at the wolf in sheep
cloth the man of blood who pretend to farm
everybodi look at john again and await hi answer in dead silenc
there ar more than a hundr thousand men in the regular british armi
and as mani more in the indian armi and twice as mani more volunt
he said in a rather irrit voic
thi statement also wa receiv with the most discourag incredul
there ar three thousand men in the british armi repeat the old
ladi in a tone of certainti that wa posit crush
yah yah chime in some of the younger men in choru
there ar three thousand men in the british armi she repeat for the
third time in triumph if the captain sai that there ar more he li
it is natur that he should lie about hi own armi my grandfath
brother wa at cape town in the time of governor smith and he saw the
whole british armi he count them there were exactli three thousand
i sai that there ar three thousand men in the british armi
yah yah said the choru and john gaze at thi terribl person in
bland exasper
how mani men do you command in the british armi she interrog
after a solemn paus
a hundr said john sharpli
girl said the old woman address on of her daughter you have
been to school and can reckon how mani time doe on hundr go into
three thousand
the young ladi address giggl confusedli and look for assist
to a sardon boer whom she wa go to marri who shook hi head
sadli indic therebi that these were mysteri into which it wa
not well to pry thrown on her own resourc she plung into the
recess of an intric calcul in which her finger plai a
consider part and final with an air of triumph announc that
it went twentysix time exactli
yah yah said the choru it goe twentysix time exactli
the captain said the oracular old ladi who wa rapidli drive john
mad command a twentysixth part of the british armi and he sai that
he come here to farm with uncl sila croft he sai she went on
with wither contempt that he come here to farm when he command a
twentysixth part of the british armi it is evid that he li
yah yah said the choru
it is natur that he should lie she continu all englishmen lie
especi the rooibaatj englishmen but he should not lie so badli
it must vex the dear lord to hear a man lie so badli even though he be
an englishman and a rooibaatj
at thi point john burst from the hous and swore frantic to
himself as soon as he wa outsid it is to be hope that he wa
forgiven for the provoc wa not small it is not pleasant to be
univers set down not onli as a leugenaar liar but as on of the
veri feeblest order
in anoth minut old han coetze came out and pat him warmli on the
shoulder in a wai that seem to sai that whatev other might think
of the insuffici of hi power of falsehood he for on quit
appreci them and announc that it wa time to be move
accordingli the parti climb into their cart or on to their
shootinghors as the case might be and start frank muller john
notic wa mount as usual on hi fine black hors after drive
for more than half an hour along an indefinit kind of waggon track the
lead cart in which were old han coetze himself a malai driver
and a colour cape boi turn to the left across the open veldt and
the other follow in turn thi went on for some time till at last
thei reach the crest of a rise that command a larg sweep of open
countri and here han halt and held up hi hand whereon the
other halt too on look out over the vast plain befor him john
discov the reason about half a mile beneath them wa a great herd
of blesbuck feed three hundr or more of them and beyond them
anoth herd of some sixti or seventi much larger and wilderlook
anim with white tail which john at onc recognis as vilderbeest
nearer to them again dot about here and there on the plain were a
coupl of dozen or so of grace yellow springbuck
now a council of war wa held which result in the men on
horsebackamong whom wa frank mullerb despatch to circumv
the herd and drive them toward the cart that took up their station
at variou point toward which the buck were like to run
then came a paus of a quarter of an hour or so till suddenli from
the far ridg of the opposit slope john saw a coupl of puff of white
smoke float up into the air and on of the vilderbeest below roll
over on hi back kick and plung furious thereon the whole herd
of buck turn and came thunder toward them stretch in a long
line across the wide veldt the springbuck first then the blesbuck
look for all the world like a herd of great beard goat ow to
their peculiar habit of hold their long head down as thei gallop
behind and mix up with them were the vilderbeest who twist and
turn and jump into the air as though thei had gone clean off their
head and were next second go clean on to them it is veri difficult
ow to hi extraordinari method of progress to distinguish on
part of a gallop vilderbeest from anoth now it is hi horn now
hi tail and now hi hoof that present themselv to the watcher
bewild vision and now again thei all seem to be mix up togeth
on came the great herd make the ground shake beneath their footfal
and after them gallop the mount boer from time to time jump
off their hors to fire a shot into the line of game which gener
result in some poor anim be left sprawl on the ground whereon
the sportsmen would remount and continu the chase
present the buck were within rang of some of the gun in the cart
and a regular fusillad began about twenti blesbuck turn and came
straight past john at a distanc of forti yard spring to the
ground he fire both barrel of hi express at them as thei tore
alongala and ala without touch them the first bullet struck
under their belli the second must have shave their back reload
rapidli he fire again at about two hundr yard rang and thi time
on fell to hi second barrel but he knew that it wa a chanc shot he
had fire at the last buck and he had kill on ten pace in front
of it in fact thi sort of shoot is extrem difficult till the
sportsman understand it the inexperienc hand fire across a line of
buck will not kill onc in twenti shot as an infinitesim differ
in elev or the slightest error in judg distancein itself
no easi art on those great plainswil spoil hi aim a boer almost
invari get immedi behind a herd of run buck and fire
at on about halfwai down the line consequ if hi elev is a
littl wrong or if he ha misjudg hi sight the odd ar that he
will hit on either in front of or behind the particular anim fire
at all that is necessari is that the line of fire should be good thi
john soon learnt and when he had master the fact he becam as good a
game shot as the major of boer but it be hi first attempt much
to hi vexat he did not particularli distinguish himself that dai
with the result that hi friend the dutchmen went home firmli convinc
that the english rooibaatj shot as indiffer as he li
jump into the cart again and leav the dead blesbuck to look after
itself for the presentnot a veri safe thing to do in a countri where
there ar so mani vulturesjohn or rather jantj put the hors into
a gallop and awai thei went at full tear it wa a most excit mode
of progress bump along furious with a load rifl in hi hand
over a plain on which antheap as larg as an armchair were scatter
like burnt almond on a cake then there were the antbear hole to
reckon with and the littl swamp in the hollow and other agreeabl
surpris but the rush and exhilar of the thing were too great to
allow him much time to think of hi neck so awai thei flew hang on
to the cart as best thei could and trust to provid to save them
from complet disast now thei were bound over an antheap now on
of the hors wa on hi nose but somehow thei alwai escap the
last dire catastroph thank chiefli to the littl hottentot skil
drive
whenev the game wa within rang thei pull up and john would spring
from the cart and let drive then jump in and follow on again thi
went on for nearli an hour in which time he had fire twentyseven
cartridg and kill three blesbuck and wound a vilderbeest which
thei proceed to chase but the vilderbeest wa struck in the rump
and an antelop so wound will travel far and go veri fast also so
that some mile of ground had been cover befor it began to rest onli
to start on again as thei drew near at last on cross the crest of
a littl rise john saw what at first he took to be hi vilderbeest
dead a second look howev show him that although it wa a dead
vilderbeest most undoubtedli it wa not the on which he had wound
for that anim wa stand it head hang about on hundr and
twenti yard beyond the other buck which no doubt had fallen to
somebodi els rifl or els had been hit farther back and come here
to die now thi vilderbeest lai within a hundr yard of them and
jantj point out to john that hi best plan would be to get out of the
cart and creep on hi hand and knee up to the dead anim from the
cover of which he would get a good shot at hi own wound bull
accordingli jantj have withdrawn with the cart and hors out of
sight under the shelter of the rise john crouch upon hi hand and
knee and proceed to carri out hi stalk all went well till he wa
quit close to the dead cow and wa congratul himself on the
prospect of an excel shot at the wound bull when suddenli
someth struck the ground violent just beneath hi bodi throw up
a cloud of earth and dust he stop amaz and at that instant heard
the report of a rifl somewhat to hi right and knew that a bullet
had pass beneath him scarc had he realis thi when there wa a
sudden commot in hi hair and the soft black felt hat that he wa
wear start from hi head appar of it own accord and after
twirl round twice or thrice in the air fell gentli to the earth
just as the sound of a second report reach hi ear it wa now
evid that somebodi wa fire at him so jump up from hi
crouch posit john toss hi arm into the air and sprang and
shout in a wai that left no mistak as to hi whereabout in anoth
minut he saw a man on horseback canter easili toward him in whom
he had littl difficulti in recognis frank muller he pick up hi
hat there wa a bullethol right through it then full of wrath he
advanc to meet frank muller
what the devil do you mean by fire at me he ask
allemacht carl almighti my dear fellow wa the cool answer
i thought that you were a vilderbeest calf i gallop the cow and
kill her and she had a calf with her and when i got the cartridg
out of my riflefor on stuck and took me some timeand the new on
in i look up and there as i thought wa the calf so i got my
rifl on and let drive first with on barrel and then with the other
and when i saw you jump up like that and shout and that i had been
fire at a man i nearli faint thank the almighti i did not hit
you
john listen coldli i suppos that i am bound to believ you
meinheer muller he said but i have been told that you have the
most wonder sight of ani man in these part which make it odd that
at three hundr yard you should mistak a man upon hi hand and knee
for a vilderbeest calf
doe the captain think then that i wish to murder him especi
he ad after i shook hi hand thi morn
i dont know what i think answer john look straight into
muller ey which fell befor hi own all i know is that your
curiou mistak veri nearli cost me my life look here and he took a
lock of hi brown hair out of the crown of hi perfor hat and show
it to the other
ay it wa veri close let us thank god that you escap
it could not well have been closer meinheer i hope that for your
own sake and for the sake of the peopl who go out shoot with you
you will not make such a mistak again goodmorn
the handsom boer or anglobo sat on hi hors stroke hi
beauti beard and gaze curious after john niel sturdi
englishlook figur as he march toward the cart for of cours
the wound vilderbeest had long ago vanish
i wonder he said to himself aloud as he turn hi hors head
and rode leisur awai if the old volk ar right after all and if
there is a god frank muller wa suffici impregn with modern
idea to be a freethink it almost seem like it he went on els
how did it come that the on bullet pass under hi belli and the other
just touch hi head without harm him i aim carefulli enough too
and i could make the shot nineteen time out of twenti and not miss
bah a god i snap my finger at him chanc is the onli god chanc
blow men about like the dead grass till death come down like the
veldt fire and devour them but there ar men who ride chanc as on
ride a young coltai who turn it headlong rush and rear to
their own endswho let it fly hither and thither till it is weari and
then canter it along the road that lead to triumph i frank muller am
on of those men i never fail in the end i will kill that englishman
perhap i will kill old sila croft and the hottentot too bah thei
do not know what is come i know i have help to lai the mine and
unless thei bend to my will i shall be the on to fire it i will kill
them all and i will take mooifontein and then i will marri bessi she
will fight against it but that will make it all the sweeter she love
that rooibaatj i know it and i will kiss her over hi dead bodi
ah there ar the cart i dont see the captain driven home i
suppos on account of the shock to hi nerv well i must talk to
those fool lord what fool thei ar with their chatter about the
land and the verdomd britisch gouvern thei dont know what
is good for them silli sheep with frank muller for a shepherd ay and
thei shall have frank muller for a presid on dai and i will rule
them too bah i hate the english but i am glad that i am half
english for all that for that is where i get the brain but these
peoplefool fool well i shall pipe and thei shall danc
baa said jantj to john as thei were drive homeward baa frank
shot at you
how do you know that ask john
i saw him he wa stalk the wound bull and not look for a calf
at all there wa no calf he wa just go to fire at the wound bull
when he turn and saw you and he knelt down on on knee and cover
you and befor i could do anyth he fire and then when he saw that
he had miss you he fire again and i dont know how it wa that he
did not kill you for he is a wonder shot with a rifleh never
miss
i will have the man tri for attempt murder said john bring
the buttend of hi rifl down with a bang on to the bottom of the cart
a villain like that shall not go scotfre
jantj grin it is no us baa he would get off for i am the
onli wit a juri wont believ a black man in thi countri and thei
would never punish a boer for shoot at an englishman no baa you
should lie up on dai in the veldt where he is go to pass and shoot
him that is what i would do if i dare
chapter xi

charm monotoni for whatev gai worldl mai think monotoni
is as full of charm as a dreami summer afternoon happi is the countri
that ha no histori sai the voic of wisdom and the same remark
mayb made with even more truth of the individu to get up in the
morn consciou of health and strength to pursu the common round and
daili task till even come and final to go to bed pleasantli tire
and sleep the sleep of the just is the true secret of happi fierc
excit excurs and alarm do not conduc either to mental or
physic wellb and it is for thi reason that we find that those
whose live have been chiefli concern with them crave the most after
the quiet round of domest life when thei get it often it is true
thei pant for the ardour of the frai whereof the dim and distant sound
ar echo through the space of their heart in the same wai that the
countri without a histori ar sometim anxiou to write on in their
own blood but that is a principl of natur who will allow of no
stand still among her subject and who ha ordain that strife of
on sort or anoth shall be the absolut condit of exist
on the whole john found that the life of a south african farmer came
well up to hi expect he had ampl occup inde what
between ostrich hors cattl sheep and crop he wa rather over
than under occupi nor wa he much troubl by the lack of civilis
societi for he wa a man who read a great deal and book could be
order from durban and cape town while the weekli mail brought with it
a suffici suppli of paper on sundai he alwai read the polit
articl in the saturdai review aloud to sila croft who as he grew
older found that the print tri hi ey an attent which the
old man greatli appreci sila wa a wellinform man and
notwithstand hi long life spent in a halfcivilis countri had
never lost hi hold of affair or hi interest in the wide and rush
life of the world in on of whose side eddi he live apart thi
task of read the saturdai review aloud had formerli been a part
of bessi sundai servic but her uncl wa veri glad to effect an
exchang bessi mind wa not quit in tune with the profund of
that learn journal and her attent wa apt to wonder at the most
point passag
thu it came about what between the saturdai review and other thing
that a veri warm and deep attach sprang up twixt the old man and hi
younger partner john wa a take man especi to the ag for whom
he wa never tire of perform littl servic on of hi favourit
sai wa that old peopl should be let down easi and he act up
to it moreov there wa a quiet jolliti and a bluff honesti about him
which wa undoubtedli attract both to men and women abov all he
wa a wellinform experienc man and a gentleman in a countri in
which both were rare each week sila croft came to reli more and more
on him and allow thing to pass more and more into hi hand
im get old niel he said to him on night im get veri
old the grasshopp is becom a burden to me and ill tell you what
it is my boi lai hi hand affection upon john shoulder i
have no son of my own and you must be a son to me as my dear bessi
ha been a daughter
john look up into the kindli handsom face crown with it
fring of snowi hair and at the keen ey set deep in it beneath the
overhang brow and thought of hi old father who wa long sinc
dead and somehow he wa move and hi own ey fill with tear
ay mr croft he said take the old man hand that i will to the
best of my abil
thank you my boi thank you i dont like talk much about these
thing but as i said i am get old and the almighti mai requir
my account ani hour and if he doe i reli on you to look after these
two girl it is a wild countri thi and on never know what will
happen in it from dai to dai and thei mai want help sometim i wish
i were clear of the place and now im go to bed i am begin to
feel as though i had done my dai work in the world im get feebl
john thi is the fact of it
after that he alwai call him john
of jess thei heard but littl she wrote everi week it is true and
gave an accur account of all that wa go on at pretoria and of
her daili do but she wa on of those peopl whose letter tell on
absolut noth of themselv and of what is pass in their mind
thei ought to have been head our pretoria letter as bessi said
disgustedli after read through three sheet in jesss curiou
upright handwrit onc you lose sight of jess she went on she
might as well be dead for all you learn about her not that on learn
veri much when she is here she ad reflect
she is a peculiar woman said john thoughtfulli at first he had
miss her veri much for strang as she undoubtedli wa she had
touch a new string in him of the exist of which he had not till
then been himself awar and what is more it had answer strongli
enough for some time but now it wa slowli vibrat itself into
silenc again much as a harp doe when the striker take hi finger
from the string had she stai on anoth week or so the effect might
have been more endur
but although jess had gone awai bessi had not on the contrari she wa
alwai about him surround him with that tender care a woman howev
involuntarili cannot prevent herself from lavish on the man she
love her beauti move about the place like a beam of light about a
garden for she wa inde a love woman and as pure and good as she
wa love nor could john long remain in ignor of her like for
himself he wa not a vain manveri much the revers indeedbut
neither wa he a fool and it must be said that though bessi never
overstep the bound of maidenli reserv neither did she take
particular pain to hide her prefer inde it wa too strong
to permit her so to do not that she wa anim by the halfdivin
soulsear breath of passion such as anim her sister which is a
veri rare thing and take it altogeth as undesir and unsuit
to the ordinari condit of thi prosaic and workadai life as it
is rare but she wa tenderli and truli in love after the usual
youngwomanli fashion inde her passion measur by the everydai
standard would have prove to be a deep on howev thi might be she
wa undoubtedli prepar to make john niel a faith and love wife if
he chose to ask her to marri him
and as the week went onthough of cours he knew noth of all
thisit becam a veri seriou question to john whether he should not
ask her it is not good for a man to live alon especi in the
transvaal and it wa not possibl for him to pass dai by dai at the
side of so much beauti and so much grace without think that it
would be well to draw the bond of union closer inde had john been
a younger man of less experi he would have succumb to the
temptat much sooner than he did but he wa neither veri young nor
veri inexperienc ten year or more ago in hi green and gush
youth as ha been said he had burnt hi finger to the bone and a
live recollect of thi incid in hi career heretofor had prove
a veri effici warn also he had reach that period of life when
men think a great mani time befor thei commit themselv wildli to the
deep matrimoni water at threeandtwenti for the sake of a pretti
face most of us ar will to undertak the seriou and in mani
case overwhelm burden risk and care of famili life and the
respons of the parentag of a larg and healthi brood but at
threeandthirti we take a differ view of the matter the temptat
mai be great but the per contra list is so veri alarm and we
never know even then if we see all the liabil such ar the
black thought that move in the breast of selfish men to the great
disadvantag of the marriag market and howev it mai lower john niel
in the ey of those who take the troubl to follow thi portion of hi
life histori in the interest of truth it must be confess that he
wa not free from them
in short sweet and pretti as bessi might be he wa not violent in
love with her and at thirtyfour a man must be violent in love to
rush into the near risk of matrimoni but howev commend
cautiou that man mai be he is alwai liabl to fall into temptat
suffici strong to sweep awai hi caution and make a mockeri of hi
plan howev strong the rope it ha it break strain and in the
same wai our power of resist to ani given cours depend entir
upon the power of the temptat to draw us into it thu it wa
destin to be with our friend john niel
it wa about a week after hi convers with old sila croft that it
occur to john that bessi manner had grown rather strang of late
it seem to him that she had avoid hi societi instead of show a
certain partial for it if not of court it also she had look
pale and worri and evinc a tendenc to irrit that wa quit
foreign to her natur sweet of charact now when a person on
whom on is accustom to depend for most of that social intercours
and those pleasant littl amen which member of on sex valu from
anoth suddenli cut off the suppli without ani appar rhyme or
reason it is enough to induc a feel of wonder not to sai of
vexat in the breast it never occur to john that the reason
might be that bessi wa truli fond of him and perhap unconsci
disappoint that he did not show a warmer interest in her if howev
we were to examin into the fact of the case we should probabl
discov that here wa the real explan of thi chang bessi wa
a straightforward young person whose mind and purpos were as clear
as run water she wa vex with johnthough she would probabl not
have own it even to herself in so mani wordsand her manner reflect
the condit of her mind
bessi said john on love dai just as the afternoon wa merg
into even bessieh alwai call her bessi nowi am go
down to the black wattl plantat by the big meali patch i want to
see how those young tree ar do if you have done your cookingfor
she had been engag in make a cake as young ladi to their soul
health often have to do in the coloniesi wish you would put on your
hat and come with me i dont believ that you have been out todai
thank you captain niel i dont think that i want to come out
why not he said
oh i dont knowbecaus there is too much to do if i go out that
stupid girl will burn the cake and she point to a kafir intombi
young girl who arrai in a blue smock a sweet smile and a feather
stuck in her wool wa vigor emploi in stare at the fli on
the ceil and suck her black finger realli she ad with a
littl stamp on need the patienc of an angel to put up with that
idiot stupid yesterdai she smash the biggest dinnerdish and
then brought me the piec with a broad grin on her face and ask me
to make them on again the white peopl were so clever she said it
would be no troubl to me if thei could make the china plate onc and
could caus flower to grow on it it would sure be easi to make it
whole again i did not know whether to laugh or cry or throw the piec
at her
look here young woman said john take the sin girl by the arm
and lead her solemnli to the oven which wa open to receiv the
cake look here if you let that cake burn while the inkosikaa ladi
chieftain is awai when i come back i will cram you into the oven to
burn with it i cook a girl like that in natal last year and when she
came out she wa quit white
bessi translat thi fiendish threat whereat the girl grin from
ear to ear and murmur koo chief in cheer acquiesc a
kafir maid on a pleasant afternoon is not troubl by the prospect of
be bake at nightfal which is a long wai off especi when it is
john niel who threaten the bake the nativ about mooifontein had
taken the measur of john foot by thi time with accuraci hi threat
were aw but hi perform were not great onc inde he wa
forc to engag in a standup fight with a great fellow who thought
that he could be taken advantag of on thi account but after he had
succeed in administ a sound hide to that champion he wa never
again troubl in thi respect
now he said i think we have provid for the safeti of your cake
so come on
thank you captain niel answer bessi look at him in a
bewitch littl wai she well knew how to assum thank you but i
think i had rather not go out walk thi wa what she said but her
ey ad i am offend with you i want to have noth to do with
you
veri well said john then i suppos i must go alon and he took up
hi hat with the air of a martyr
bessi look through the open kitchen door at the light and shadow
that chase each other across the swell bosom of the hill behind the
hous
it certainli is veri fine she said ar you go far
no onli round the plantat
there ar so mani puffadd down there and i hate snake suggest
bessi by wai of find anoth excus for not come
oh ill look after the puffadderscom along
well she said at last as she slowli unrol her sleev which had
been tuck up dure the cakemak and hid her beauti white
arm i will come not becaus i want to come but becaus you have
overpersuad me i dont know what is happen to me she ad
with a littl stamp and a sudden fill of her ey with tear i do
not seem to have ani will of my own left when i want to do on thing
and you want me to do anoth it is i who have to do what you want and
i tell you i dont like it captain niel and i shall be veri cross out
walk and sweep past him on her wai to fetch her hat in that
peculiarli grace fashion which angri women can sometim assum she
left john to reflect that he never saw a more charm or take ladi in
europ or out of it
he had half a mind to risk it and ask her to marri him but then
perhap she might refus him and that wa a conting which he did
not quit appreci after their first youth few men altogeth relish
the idea of put themselv in a posit that give a caprici
woman an opportun of first figur jump on them and
then perhap hold them up to the scorn and obloqui of her friend
relat and other admir for unfortun until the opposit is
clearli demonstr mani men ar apt to believ that not a few women
ar by natur caprici shallow and unreli and john niel
ow possibl to that unhappi littl experi of hi youth must be
reckon among their misguid rank
chapter xii
over it
on leav the hous bessi and john took their wai down the long avenu
of blue gum thi avenu wa old sila croft particular pride sinc
although it had onli been plant for about twenti year the tree
which in the divin climat and virgin soil of the transvaal grow at the
most extraordinari rate were for the most part veri lofti and as thick
in the stem as english oak of a hundr and fifti year stand the
avenu wa not over wide and the tree were plant quit close on to
anoth with the result that their brown pillarlik stem shot up for
mani feet without a branch whilst high overhead the bough cross and
intermingl in such a wai as to form a leafi tunnel through which the
landscap beyond appear as though through a telescop
down thi charm avenu john and bessi walk and on reach it
limit thei turn to the right and follow a littl footpath wind in
and out of the rock that built up the plateau on the hillsid whereon
the hous stood present thi led them through the orchard then came
a bare strip of veldt a veri danger spot in a thunderstorm but
a great safeguard to the stead and tree round it for the ironston
crop up here and from the hous on might often see flash after
flash strike down on to it and even run and zigzag about it
surfac to the left of thi ironston were some cultiv land and
in front of them the plantat in which john wa anxiou to inspect
the recent plant wattl
thei walk up to the cops without sai a word it wa surround
by a ditch and a low sod wall whereon bessi seat herself remark
that she would wait there till he had look at the tree as she wa
afraid of the puffadd whereof a larg and thrive famili were
known to live in thi plantat
john assent observ that the puffadd were brute and that he
must have some pig turn in to destroi them which the pig effect
by munch them up appar without unpleas consequ to
themselv then he depart on hi errand wend hi wai gingerli
through the featheri black wattl it did not take long and he saw
no puffadd when he had finish look at the young tree he
return still walk delic like agag on reach the border of
the plantat he paus to look at bessi who wa some twenti pace
from him perch sidewai on the low sod wall and frame as it were
in the full rich light of the set sun her hat wa off for the sun
had lost it burn forc and the hand that held it hung idli by her
while her ey were fix on the horizon flame with all the vari
glori of an african sunset he gaze at her sweet face and lissom
form and some line that he had read year befor float into hi
mind
the littl curl about her head
were all her crown of gold
her delic arm droop downward
in slender mould
as whitevein leav of lili
curv and fold
she move to measur of music
as a swan sail the stream
he had got thu far when she turn and saw him and he abandon poetri
in the presenc of on who might well have inspir it
what ar you look at she said with a smile the sunset
no i wa look at you
then you might have been better emploi with the sky she answer
turn her head quickli look at it did you ever see such a
sunset we sometim get them like that at thi time of year when the
thunderstorm ar about
she wa right it wa gloriou the heavi cloud which a coupl of hour
befor had been roll like celesti hears across the azur deep
were now aflam with glori some of them glow like huge castl
wrap in fire other with the dull red heat of burn coal the
eastern heaven wa on sheet of burnish gold that slowli grew to red
and higher yet to orang and the faintest rose to the left depart
sunbeam rest lovingli on grei quathlamba crest even fire the
etern snow that lai upon hi highest peak and write onc more upon
their white the record of anoth dai fulfil lower down the sky
float littl cloud flameflak fallen from the burn mass abov
and on the earth beneath lai great depth of shadow bar with the
bright of the dy light
john stood and gaze at it and it live glow beauti seem to
fire hi imagin as it fire earth and heaven in such sort that
the torch of love lit upon hi heart like the sunbeam on the mountain
top then from the celesti beauti of the ski he turn to look at
the earthli beauti of the woman who sat there befor him and found
that also fair whether it wa the contempl of the glori of
naturefor there is alwai a suspicion of melancholi in beauti
thingsor whatev it wa her face had a touch of sad on it that
he had never seen befor and which certainli ad to it charm as a
shadow add to the charm of the light
what ar you think of bessi he ask
she look up and he saw that her lip were quiver a littl well
do you know she said oddli enough i wa think of my mother i
can onli just recal her a woman with a thin sweet face i rememb
on even she wa sit in front of a hous while the sun wa
set as it is now and i wa plai by her when suddenli she
call me to her and kiss me then point to the red cloud that were
gather in the sky and said i wonder if you will ever think of
me dear when i have pass through those golden gate i did not
understand what she meant but somehow i have rememb the word and
though she di so long ago i do often think of her and two larg
tear roll down her face as she spoke
few men can bear to see a sweet and pretti woman in tear and thi
littl incid wa too much for john whose caution and doubt all went
to the wind togeth
bessi he said dont cry dear pleas dont i cant bear to see
you cry
she look up as though to remonstr at hi word then she look
down again
listen bessi he went on awkwardli enough i have someth to sai
to you i want to ask you ifif in short you will marri me wait a
bit dont sai anyth yet you know me pretti well by now i am no
chicken dear and i have knock about the world a good deal and had
on or two love affair like other peopl but bessi i never met such
a sweet woman or if you will let me sai it such a love woman as you
ar and if you will have me dear i think that i shall be the luckiest
man in south africa and he stop not know exactli what els to
sai and feel that the time had not come for action if inde it wa
to come at all
when first she understood the drift of hi talk bessi had flush up to
the ey then the blood sank back to her breast and left her as pale
as a lili she love the man and thei were happi word to her and she
wa satisfi with them though perhap some women might have thought
that thei left a good deal to be desir but bessi wa not of an
exact natur
at last she spoke
ar you sure she ask that you mean all thi you know sometim
peopl sai thing of a sudden upon an impuls and afterward thei wish
thei never had been said then it would be rather awkward suppos i
were to sai ye would it not
of cours i am sure he said indignantli
you see went on bessi poke at the sod wall with the stick
she held in her hand perhap in thi place you might be put an
exagger valu on me you think i am pretti becaus you see nobodi
but kafir and boer women and it would be the same with everyth im
not fit to marri such a man as you she went on with a sudden burst
of distress i have never seen anyth or anybodi i am noth but an
ignor halfeduc farmer girl with noth to recommend me and
no fortun except my look you ar differ to me you ar a man of
the world and if ever you went back to england i should be a drag on
you and you would be asham of me and my coloni wai if it had been
jess now it would have been differ for she ha more brain in her
littl finger than i have in my whole bodi
somehow thi mention of jess jar upon john nerv and chill him
like a breath of cold wind on a hot dai he want to put jess out of
hi mind just now
my dear bessi he broke in why do you suppos such thing i can
assur you that if you appear in a london drawingroom you would put
most of the women into the shade not that there is much chanc of my
frequent london drawingroom again he ad
oh ye i mai be goodlook i dont sai that i am not but cant
you understand i do not want you to marri me just becaus i am a pretti
woman as the kafir marri their wive if you marri me at all i want
you to marri me becaus you care for me the real me not my ey
and my hair oh i dont know what to answer you i dont inde and
she began to cry softli
bessi dear bessi said john who wa pretti well besid himself by
thi time just tell me honestlydo you care about me i am not worth
much i know but if you do all thi goe for noth and he took her
hand and drew her toward him so that she half slip half rose from
the sod wall and stood face to face with him for she wa a tall woman
and thei were veri nearli of a height
twice she rais her beauti ey to hi to answer and twice her
courag fail her then at last the truth broke from her almost with a
cry
oh john i love you with all my heart
and now it will be well to drop a veil over the rest of these
proceed for there ar some thing that should be sacr even from
the pen of the historian and the first transport of the love of a good
woman is on of them
suffic it to sai that thei sat there side by side on the sod wall
and were happi as peopl ought to be under such circumst till the
glori depart from the western sky and the world grew cold and pale
till the night came down and hid the mountain and onli the star and
thei were left to look out across the duski distanc of the wilder
of plain
meanwhil a veri differ scene wa be enact up at the hous half
a mile awai
not more than ten minut after john and hi ladylov had depart on
that fate walk to look at the young tree frank muller stalwart
form mount on hi great black hors wa to be seen leisur
advanc toward the bluegum avenu jantj wa lurk about between
the stem of the tree in the peculiar fashion that is characterist
of the hottentot and which doubtless is bred into him after ten of
centuri of track anim and hide from enemi there he wa
slip from trunk to trunk and gaze round him as though he expect
each instant to discov the assegai of an ambush foe or to hear the
footfal of some savag beast of prei absolut there wa no reason
why he should behav in thi fashion he wa simpli indulg hi
natur instinct where he thought nobodi would observ him life at
mooifontein wa altogeth too tame and civilis for jantj tast
and he need period recreat of thi sort like a civilis
child he long for wild beast and enemi and if there were none at
hand he found a reflect satisfact in make a pretenc of their
presenc
present howev whilst thei were yet a long wai off hi quick ear
caught the sound of the hors footfal and he straighten himself
and listen not satisfi with the result he laid himself down put
hi ear to the earth and gave a guttur sound of satisfact
baa frank black hors jantj mutter to himself the black hors
ha a crack heel and on foot hit the ground more softli than the
other what is baa frank come here for after missi i think he
would be mad if he knew that missi went down to the plantat with
baa niel just now peopl go into plantat to kiss each other
jantj wa not far out there and it would make baa frank mad if he
knew that he would strike me if i told him or i would tell him
the hors hoof were draw near by now so jantj slip as easili
and natur as a snake into a thick tuft of rank grass which grew
between the blue gum and wait nobodi would have guess that thi
tuft of grass hid a human be not even a boer would have guess it
unless he had happen to walk right on to the spy and then it would
have been a chanc but that the hottentot manag to avoid be trodden
on and escap detect again there wa no reason why he should hide
himself in thi fashion except that it pleas him to do so
present the big hors approach and the snakelik hottentot rais
hi head ever so littl and peer out with hi beadi black ey through
the strawlik grass stem thei fell on muller cold face it wa
evid that he wa in a reflect moodin an angrili reflect mood
so absorb wa he that he nearli let hi hors which wa also absorb
by the near prospect of a comfort stall put hi foot in a big hole
that a wander antbear had amus himself on the previou night by
dig exactli in the centr of the road
what is baa frank think of i wonder said jantj to himself as
hors and man pass within four feet of him then rise he cross
the road and slip round by a back wai like a fox from a covert
wa stand at the stabledoor with a vacant and utterli unobserv
express of face some second befor the black hors and it rider had
reach the hous
i will give them on more chanc just on more thought the handsom
boer or rather halfbreedfor it will be rememb that hi mother
wa englishand if thei wont take it then let their fate be upon
their own head tomorrow i go to the bymakaar at paard kraal to
take counsel with paul kruger and pretoriu and the other father
of the land as thei call themselv if i throw in my weight against
rebellion there will be no rebellion if i urg it there will be and
if oom sila will not give me bessi and bessi will not marri me i
will urg it even if it plung the whole countri in war from the cape to
waterberg patriot independ taxesthat is what thei will cry
till thei begin to believ it themselv bah those ar not the thing
that i would go to war for but ambit and reveng ah that is
anoth matter i would kill them all if thei stood in my wai all
except bessi if war break out who will hold up a hand to help the
verdomd englesmann thei would all be afraid and it is not my
fault can i help if it i love that woman can i help it if my blood
dri up with long for her and if i lie awak hour by hour of
night ay and weepi frank muller who saw the murder bodi of my
father and my mother and shed no tearbecaus she hate me and will not
look favour upon me
oh woman woman thei talk of ambit and of avaric and of
selfpreserv as the kei of charact and action but what forc is
there to move us like a woman a littl thing a weak fragil thinga
toi from which the rain will wash the paint and of which the rust will
stop the work and yet a thing that can shake the world and pour out
blood like water and bring down sorrow like the rain so i stand by
the boulder a touch and it will go crash down the mountainsid
so that the world hear it shall i send it it is all on to me let
bessi and oom sila judg i would slaughter everi englishman in
the transvaal to gain bessieai and everi boer too and throw all the
nativ in and he laugh aloud and struck the great black hors
make it plung and caper gallantli
and then he went on give hi ambit wing when i have won
bessi and we have kick all these englishmen out of the land in a
veri few year i shall rule thi countri and what next why then i
will stir up the dutch feel in natal and in the old coloni and we
will push the englishmen back into the sea make a clean sweep of the

he hit upon anoth expedi to the servic of which he brought a
ventriloquist power that is not uncommon among nativ suddenli the
silenc wa broken by a fright and prolong wail that seem to
shape itself into the word frank and to proce from the air just
abov the struggl bessi head the effect produc upon muller wa
someth wonder
allemacht he cri look up it is my mother voic
frank wail the voic again and he let go of bessi in hi
perplex and fear and turn round to try and discov whenc the
sound proceededa circumst of which that young ladi took advantag
to beat a rapid if not veri dignifi retreat
frank frank frank wail and howl the voic now overhead now
on thi side now on that till at last muller thoroughli mystifi
and feel hi superstiti fear rise apac as the moan sound
flit about beneath the dark arch of the gumtre made a rush for
hi hors which wa snort and trembl in everi limb it is almost
as easi to work upon the superstiti fear of a dog or a hors as upon
those of a man but muller not be awar of thi took the anim
alarm as a clear indic of the uncanni natur of the voic with
a singl bound he sprang into hi saddl and as he did so the woman
voic wail out onc more
frank thou shalt die in blood as i did frank
muller turn livid with fear and the cold perspir stream from
hi face he wa a bold man enough physic but thi wa too much for

it is my mother voic thei ar her veri word he call out aloud
then dash hi spur into hi hors flank he went like a flash
far from the accurs spot nor did he draw rein till he came to hi own
place ten mile awai twice the hors fell in the dark for there
wa no moon the second time throw him heavili but he onli drag
it up with an oath and spring into the saddl again fled on as
befor
thu the man who did not hesit to plot and to execut the cruel
slaughter of unoffend men cower beneath the fanci echo of a dead
woman voic truli human natur is full of contradict
when the thunder of the hors hoof grew faint jantj emerg from on
of hi hidingplac and throw himself down in the centr of the

an inward joi to which hi habit of caution would not permit him to
give audibl vent hi mother voic hi mother word he quot
to himself how should he know that jantj rememb the old woman

final he depart to eat hi supper of beef which he had cut off
an unfortun ox which that morn had expir of a mysteri
complic of diseas fill with a happi sens that he had not
live that dai in vain
bessi fled without stop till she reach the orangetre in front
of the verandah where reassur by the light from the window she
paus to consid not that she wa troubl by jantj mysteri
howl inde she wa too preoccupi to give it a second thought
what she debat wa whether she should sai anyth about her encount
with frank muller young ladi ar not as a rule too fond of
inform their husband or lover that somebodi ha kiss them first
becaus thei know it will forc them to make a disturb and possibl
to place themselv in a ridicul posit and secondli becaus
thei fear lest suspici man might take the stori with a grain of salt
and suggest even that thei the kiss were themselv to blame both
these reason present themselv to bessi practic mind also a
further on name that he had not kiss her after all so on a rapid
review of the whole case she came to the decis to sai noth to john

bodi of boer to take possess of the pass over the drakensberg
known as la nek but there wa no definit intellig
you wont get into pretoria said on melancholi man so it no us
try the boer will just catch you and kill you and there will be
an end of it you had better leav the girl to look after herself and go
back to mooifontein
but thi wa not john view of the matter well he answer at ani
rate ill have a try inde he had a sort of bulldog natur about
him which led him to believ that if he made up hi mind to do a thing
he would do it somehow unless he should be physic incapacit by
circumst beyond hi own control it is wonder how far a mood
of the kind will take a man inde it is the widespread possess of
thi sentiment that ha made england what she is now it is begin
to die down and to be legisl out of our nation charact and the
result ar alreadi commenc to appear in the incipi decai of our
power we cannot govern ireland it is beyond us let ireland have home
rule we cannot cope with our imperi respons let them be
cast off and so on the englishmen of fifti year ago did not talk in
thi weari titan strain
well everi nation becom emascul sooner or later that seem to be
the univers fate and it appear that it is our lot to be emascul
not by the want of law but by a plethora thereof thi countri wa made
not by govern but for the most part in despit of them by the
independ effort of gener of individu the tendenc nowadai
is to merg the individu in the govern and to limit or even
forcibl to destroi person enterpris and respons everyth
is to be legisl for or legisl against as yet the system is onli
in it bud when it bloom if it is ever allow to bloom the empir
will lose touch of it constitu atom and becom a vast soulless
machin which will first get out of order then break down and last
of all break up we ow more to sturdi determin unconvinc
englishmen like john niel than we know or perhap should be will
to acknowledg in these enlighten dai long live the caucu that
is the cry of the nineteenth centuri but what will englishmen cry in
the twentieth
these word were written some ten year ago but sinc
then with all gratitud be it said a chang ha come over
the spirit of the nation or rather the spirit of the
nation ha reassert itself though the littl england
parti still linger it exist upon the edg of it own
grave the domin and respons of our empir ar
no longer a question of parti polit and among the
radic of todai we find some of the most ardent
imperialist so mai it ever beh r h 1896
john resum hi peril journei more than an hour befor dawn on
the follow morn nobodi wa stir and as it wa practic
imposs to arous the slumber kafir from the variou hole and
corner where thei were take their restfor a nativ hate the cold
of the dawningmouti and he were oblig to har the hors and
inspan them without assistancean awkward job in the dark at last
howev everyth wa readi and as the bill had been paid overnight
there wa noth to wait for so thei clamber into the cart and made
a start but befor thei had proceed forti yard howev john heard
a voic call to him to stop he did so and present hold a
light candl which burnt without a flicker in the still damp air and
drape from head to foot in a dingylook blanket appear the male
cassandra of the previou even
he advanc slowli and with digniti as becam a prophet and at length
reach the side of the cart where the sight of hi illumin figur
and of the dirti blanket over hi head nearli made the hors run awai
what is it said john testili for he wa in no mood for delai
i thought id just get up to tell you repli the drape form that
i am quit sure that i wa right and that the boer will shoot you i
should not like you to sai afterward that i have not warn you and
he held up the candl so that the light fell on john face and gaze
at it in fond farewel

chapter xv
a rough journei
the four grei were fresh hors in good condit and with a light
load behind them so notwithstand the bad state of the track which
thei call road in south africa john made good progress
by eleven oclock that dai he had reach standerton a littl town upon
the vaal not far from which had he but known it he wa destin
to meet with a suffici strike experi here he obtain
confirm of the bronker spruit disast and listen with set
face and blaze ey to the tale of treacheri and death which wa as
he said with a parallel in the annal of civilis war but after all
what doe it mattera littl squar of grave at bronker spruit
a few more widow and a hundr or so of orphan england by her
govern answer the question plainlyit matter veri littl
at standerton john wa again warn that it would be imposs for
him to make hi wai through the boer at heidelberg a town about sixti
mile from pretoria where the triumvir kruger pretori and
joubert had proclaim the republ but he answer as befor that
he must go on till he wa stop and inspan hi hors set forward
again a littl comfort by the new that the bishop of pretoria who
wa hurri up to rejoin hi famili had pass through a few hour
befor also intent upon run the blockad and that if he drove fast
he might overtak him
on he went hour after hour over the great desert plain but he did
not succe in catch up the bishop about forti mile from standerton
he saw a waggon stand by the roadsid and halt to try if he could
obtain ani inform from it driver but on investig it becam
clear that the waggon had been loot of the provis and good with
which it wa load and the oxen driven off nor wa thi the onli
evid of violenc across the disselboom of the waggon it hand
still clasp a long bamboo whip as though he had been try to
defend himself with it lai the dead bodi of the nativ driver hi
face john notic wa so compos and peac that had it not been
for the attitud and a neat littl blue hole in the forehead on might
have thought he wa asleep not dead
at sunset john outspan hi now flag hors by the roadsid and
gave them each a coupl of bundl of forag from the store that he had
brought with him whilst thei were eat it leav mouti to keep an
ey to them he stroll awai and sat down on a bit antheap to think
it wa a wild and melancholi scene that stretch befor and behind him
mile upon mile of plain roll east and west and north and south
like the billow of a frozen sea onli broken far along the heidelberg
road by some hill known as rooi koppi nor wa thi all overhead
wa blaze and burn on of those remark sunset which ar
sometim seen in the south african summer time the sky wa full of
lower cloud and the sullen orb of the set sun had stain them
perfectli bloodr bloodr thei float through the omin sky and
bloodr their shadow lai upon the grass even the air seem red it
look as though earth and heaven had been steep in blood and fresh
as john wa from the sight of the dead driver hi ear yet tingl
with the tale of bronker spruit it is not to be wonder at that the
suggest sight oppress him seat in that lone wast with no
compani except the melancholi kakarakakara of an old black koran
hidden awai somewher in the grass he wa not much given to such
reflect but he did begin to wonder whether thi wa the last
journei of all the mani he had made dure the past twenti year and if
for him a boer bullet wa about to solv the mysteri of life and death
then he sank to the stage of depress that most peopl have made
acquaint with at some time or anoth when a man begin to ask
what is the us of it why were we born what good do we do here why
should wea the major of mankind doubtless aremer anim be
laden up with sorrow till at last our poor back break is god power
or powerless if power why did he not let us sleep in peac without
set us here to tast of everi pain and mortif to becom
acquaint with everi grief and then to perish miser old
question these which the sprightli critic justli condemn as morbid
and futil and not to be dangl befor a merri world of makebeliev
perhap he is right it is better to plai at marbl on a sepulchr than
to lift the lid and peep insid but for all that thei will aris
when we sit alon at even in our individu wilder surround
perhap by memento of our broken hope and token of our belov
dead strewn about us like the bleach bone of the wild game on the
veldt and in spirit watch the red sun of our exist sink toward
it vapouri horizon thei will come even to the sanguin success
man on cannot alwai plai at marbl the lid of the sepulchr will
sometim slip asid of itself and we must see true it depend
upon individu disposit some peopl can metaphor smoke
cigarett and make pun by the deathb of their dearest friend or
even on their own we should prai for a disposit like thatit make
life more pleasant
by the time that the hors had eaten their forag and mouti had forc
the bit into their reluct mouth the angri splendour of the sunset
fade and the quiet night wa fall over the glow veldt like the
pall on on scarc dead fortun for the travel there wa a
bright half moon and by it light john manag to direct the cart over
mani a weari mile on he went for hour after hour keep hi tire
hors to the collar as best he could till at last about eleven
oclock he saw the light of heidelberg befor him and knew that the
question of whether or no hi journei wa at an end would speedili be
decid for him howev there wa noth for it but to go on and take
hi chanc of slip through present he cross a littl stream
and distinguish the shape of a cart just ahead around which men and
a coupl of lantern were move no doubt john thought to himself it
wa the bishop who had been stop by the boer he wa quit close to
the cart when it move on and in anoth second he wa greet by the
rough challeng of a sentri and caught sight of the cold gleam of a
rifl barrel
wie da who there
friend he answer cheerfulli though feel far from cheer
there wa a paus dure which the sentri call to anoth man who
came up yawn and sai someth in dutch strain hi ear he
caught the word bishop man and thi gave him an idea
who ar you englishman ask the second man gruffli hold up a
lantern to look at john and speak in english
i am the bishop chaplain sir he answer mildli try
desper to look like an unoffend clergyman and i want to get on
to pretoria with him
the man with the lantern inspect him close fortun john wore
a dark coat and a clericallook black felt hat the same that frank
muller had put a bullet through
he is a preacher fast enough said the on man to the other look he
is dress like an old crow what did oom kruger pass sai jan wa
it two cart or on that we were to let through i think it wa on
the other man scratch hi head
i think it wa two he said he did not like to confess to hi comrad
that he could not read no i am sure that it wa two
perhap we had better send up to oom kruger and ask suggest the
first man
oom kruger will be in bed and he put up hi quill like a porcupin
if on wake him wa the answer
then let us keep the damn preach englishman till tomorrow
prai let me go on gentlemen said john still in hi mildest voic
i am want to preach the word at pretoria and to watch by the wound
and dy

and dy there thei will all be like the rooibaatj at bronker
spruit lord what a sight that wa but thei will get the bishop so
thei wont want you you can stop and look after our wound if the
rooibaatj manag to hit ani of us and he beckon to him to come
out of the cart
hullo said the other man here is a bag of meali we will
command that anyhow and he took hi knife and cut the line with
which the sack wa fasten to the back of the cart so that it fell
to the ground that will feed our hors for a week he said with a
chuckl in which the other man join it wa pleasant to becom so
easili possess of an unearn increment in the shape of a bag of
meali
well ar we to get the old crow go said the first man
if we dont let him go we shall have to take him up to headquart
and i want to sleep and he yawn
well let him go said the other i think you ar right the pass
said two cart be off you damn preach englishman
john did not wait for ani more but laid the whip across the hors
back with a will
i hope we did right said the man with the lantern to the other as the
cart bump off i am not sure he wa a preacher after all i have
half a mind to send a bullet after him but hi companion who wa veri
sleepi gave no encourag to the idea so it drop
on the follow morn when command frank mullerhav heard that
hi enemi john niel wa on hi wai up with the cape cart and four grei
horsesascertain that a vehicl answer to that descript had
been allow to pass through heidelberg in the dead of night hi state
of mind mai better be imagin than describ
as for the two sentri he tri them by courtmarti and sent them to
make fortif for the rest of the rebellion now thei can neither
of them hear the name of a clergyman mention without break out into
a perfect flood of blasphemi
luckili for john although he had been delai for five minut or more
he manag to overtak the cart in which he presum the bishop wa
ensconc hi lordship had been providenti delai by the break
of a trace otherwis it is clear that hi selfnomin chaplain
would never have got through the steep street of heidelberg that night
the town wa choke up with boer waggon full of sleep boer over
on batch of waggon and tent john saw the transvaal flag flutter
idli in the night breez mark no doubt the headquart of the
triumvir and emblazon with the appropri emblem of an oxwaggon
and an arm boer onc the cart ahead of him wa stop by a sentri
and some convers ensu then it went on again and so did john
unmolest it wa weari work that journei through heidelberg and full
of terror for john who everi moment expect to be stop and drag
off ignomini to gaol the hors too were dead beat and made
frantic attempt to turn and stop at everi hous but somehow thei
won through the littl place and then were halt onc more again the
first cart pass on but thi time john wa not so lucki
the pass said on cart said a voic
yah yah on cart answer anoth
john again put on hi cleric air and told hi artless tale but
neither of the men could understand english so thei went to a waggon
that wa stand about fifti yard awai to fetch somebodi who could
now inkoo whisper the zulu mouti drive on drive on
john took the hint and lash the hors with hi long whip while
mouti bend forward over the splashboard thrash the wheeler
with a sjambock off went the team in a spasmod gallop and it had
cover a hundr yard of ground befor the two sentri realis what
had happen then thei began to run after the cart shout but were
soon lost in the dark
john and mouti did not spare the whip but press on up the stoni hill
on the pretoria side of heidelberg without a halt thei were howev
unabl to keep up with the cart ahead of them which wa evid more
freshli hors about midnight too the moon vanish altogeth and
thei must creep on as best thei could through the dark inde so
dark wa it that mouti wa oblig to get out and lead the exhaust
hors on of which would now and again fall down to be cruelli
flog befor it rose onc too the cart veri nearli upset and on
anoth occas it wa within an inch of roll down a precipic
thi went on till two in the morn when john found that it wa
imposs to forc the weari beast a yard farther so have
luckili come to some water about fifteen mile out of heidelberg he
halt and after the hors had drunk gave them as much forag as thei
could eat on lai down at onc and refus to touch anythinga sure
sign of great exhaust a second at ly down but the other two
fill themselv in a satisfactori wai then came a weari wait for the
dawn mouti slept a littl but john did not dare to do so all he could
do wa to swallow a littl biltong dri game flesh and bread drink
some squarefac and water and then sit down in the cart hi rifl
between hi knee and wait for the light at last it came ly on the
eastern sky like a promis and he onc more fed the hors and now a
new difficulti aros the anim that would not eat wa clearli too weak
to pull so the har had to be alter and the three sound anim
arrang unicorn fashion while the sick on wa fasten to the rear of
the cart then thei start again
by eleven oclock thei reach an hotel or waysid hous known as
ferguson situat about twenti mile from pretoria it wa empti
except for a coupl of cat and a strai dog the inhabit had
evid fled from the boer here john stabl and fed hi hors
give them all that remain of the forag and then onc more
inspan for the last stage the road wa dread and he knew that
the countri must be full of hostil boer but fortun he met none
it took him four hour to cover the twenti mile of ground but it wa
not until he reach the poort or neck run into pretoria that he
saw a vestig of a boer then he perceiv two mount men ride along
the top of a precipit stonestrewn ridg six hundr yard or so
from him at first he thought that thei were go to descend it but
present thei chang their mind and got off their hors
while he wa still wonder what thi might portend he saw a puff of
white smoke float up from where the men were and then anoth next
came the sharp unmistak ping of a bullet pass as far as he
could judg within some three feet of hi head follow by a second
ping and a cloud of dust beneath the belli of the first hors the
two boer were fire at him
john did not wait for ani more target practic but thrash the
hors to a canter drove the cart round a project bank befor thei
could load and fire again after that thei troubl him no more
at last he reach the mouth of the poort and saw the prettiest of
the south african town with it red and white hous it tall clump
of tree and pink line of bloom rose hedg ly on the plain
befor him all set in the green veldt made beauti by the golden
light of the afternoon and he thank god for the sight john knew that
he wa safe now and let hi tire hors walk slowli down the hillsid
and across the space of plain beyond to hi left were the gaol and the
barracksh and gather about them stood hundr of waggon and
tent toward which he drove evid the town wa desert and it
inhabit were in laager when he wa within half a mile or so a
picket of mount men rode out to meet him follow by a miscellan
crowd on horseback and on foot
who goe there shout a voic in honest english
a friend who is uncommonli glad to see you john answer with that
feebl jocos in which we ar all apt to indulg when at length a
great weight is lift from our nerv
chapter xvi
pretoria
jess wa not veri happi at pretoria previou to the unexpect outbreak
of hostil most peopl who have made a great moral effort and
after some sever mental struggl have enter on the drear path from
selfsacrific experi the reaction that will follow as certainli
as the night follow the dai it is on thing to renounc the light
to stand in the full glow of the set beam of our imperi joi and
chant out our farewel and quit anoth to live alon in the dark
for a littl while memori mai support us but memori grow faint on
everi side is the thick cheerless pall and that still through which
no sound come we ar alon quit alon cut off from the fellowship
of the dai unse and unseen more especi is thi so when the
dungeon is of our own make and we ourselv have shot it bolt
there is a natur night that come to all and in it unwav cours
swallow everi mortal hope and fear for ever and for ever to thi we
can more easili resign ourselv for we recognis the univers lot
and bow ourselv beneath the alleffac hand the earth doe not pine
when the daylight pass from it peak it onli sleep
but jess had buri herself and she knew it there wa no absolut need
for her to have sacrif her affect to her sister she had done
so of her own will and at time not unnatur she wa regret
selfdeni is a sternfac angel if onli we hold him fast and wrestl
with him long enough he will speak us soft word of happi sound just
as if we wait long enough in the dark of the night star will come
to share our loneli still thi is on of those thing that time
hide from us and onli reveal at hi own pleasur and so far as jess
wa concern hi pleasur wa not yet outwardli howev she show
no sign of her distress and of the passion which wa eat at her
heart she wa pale and silent it is true but then she had alwai been
remark for her pallor and silenc onli she gave up her sing
so the week pass veri drearili for the poor girl who wa do what
other peopl dideat and drink ride and go to parti like
the rest of the pretoria world till at last she began to think that
she had better be return home again lest she should wear out her
welcom and yet she dread to do so mind of her daili prayer to be
deliv from temptat as to what wa happen at mooifontein she
wa in almost complet ignor bessi wrote to her of cours and so
did her uncl onc or twice but thei did not tell her much of what she
want to know bessi letter were it is true full of allus
to what captain niel wa do but she did not go beyond that her
retic howev told her observ sister more than her word why
wa she so retic no doubt becaus thing still hung in the balanc
then jess would think of what it all meant for her and now and again
give wai to an outburst of passion jealousi which would have been
pain enough to wit if anybodi had been there to see it
thu the time went on toward christma for jess have been warmli
press to do so had settl to stai over christma and return to the
farm with the new year there had been a great deal of talk in the town
about the boer but she wa too much preoccupi with her own affair
to pai much attent to it nor inde wa the public mind greatli
move thei were so much accustom to boer scare at pretoria and
hitherto these had invari end in smoke but all of a sudden
on the morn of the eighteenth of decemb came the new of the
proclam of the republ the town wa thrown into a ferment and
there aros a talk of go into laager so that anxiou as she wa
to get awai jess could see no hope of return to the farm till the
excit wa over then a dai or two later conductor egerton came
limp into pretoria from the scene of the disast at bronker
spruit with the colour of the 94th regiment ti round hi middl
and such a tale to tell that the blood went to her heart and seem to
stagnat there as she listen
after that there wa confus wors confound martial law have
been proclaim the town which wa larg straggl and incap of
defenc wa abandon the inhabit be order into laager on the
high ground overlook the citi there thei were young and old sick
and well delic women and littl children all crowd togeth in
the open under the cover of the fort with noth but canva tent
waggon and shed to shelter them from the fierc summer sun and
rain jess share a waggon with her friend and her friend sister and
mother and found it rather a tight fit even to lie down sleep with all
the nois of the camp go on round her wa almost imposs
it wa about three oclock on the dai follow that first miser
night in the laager when by the last mail that pass into pretoria
she receiv bessi letter announc her engag to john she
took her letter and went some wai from the camp to the side of signal
hill where she wa not like to be disturb and find a nook
shade by mimosatre sat down and broke the envelop befor she had
reach the foot of the first page she saw what wa come and set her
teeth then she read the long epistl through from begin to end
without flinch though the word of affect seem to burn her so
it had come at last well she expect it and had plot to bring it
about so realli there wa no reason in the world why she should feel
disappoint on the contrari she ought to rejoic and for a littl
while she realli did rejoic in her sister happi it made her glad
to think that bessi whom she so dearli love wa happi
and yet she felt angri with john with that sort of anger which we feel
against those who have blindli injur us why should it be in hi power
to hurt her so cruelli still she hope that he would be happi with
bessi and then she hope that these wretch boer would take
pretoria and that she would be shot or otherwis put out of the wai
she had no heart for life all the colour had fade from her sky what
wa she to do with her futur marri somebodi and busi herself with
rear a pack of children it would be a physic imposs to her
no she would go awai to europ and mix in the great stream of life and
struggl with it and see if she could win a place for herself among the
peopl of her dai she had it in her she knew that and now that she
had put herself out of the reach of passion she would be more like to
succe for success is to the impass who ar also the strong she
would not stop on the farm after john and bessi were marri she
wa quit determin as to that nor if she could avoid it would she
return there befor thei were marri she would see him no more no
more ala that she had ever seen him
feel somewhat happier or at ani rate calmer in thi decis she
rose to return to the noisi camp extend her walk howev by a
detour toward the heidelberg road for she wa anxiou to be alon as
long as she could she had been walk some ten minut when she caught
sight of a cart that seem familiar to her with three hors har
in front of it and on ti behind which were also familiar there were
mani men walk alongsid the cart all talk eagerli
jess halt to let the littl process go by when suddenli she
perceiv john niel among these men and recognis the zulu mouti on the
box there wa the man whom she had just vow never to see again and
the sight of him seem to take all her strength out of her so that
she felt inclin to sink down upon the veldt hi sudden appear wa
almost uncanni in the sharp of it illustr of her impot in
the hand of fate she felt it then all in an instant it seem to be
born in upon her mind that she could not help herself but wa onli
the instrument in the hand of a superior power whose will she wa
fulfil through the work of her passion and to whom her
individu fate wa a matter of littl moment it wa inconclus
reason and peril doctrin but it must be allow that the
circumst gave it a colour of truth and after all the borderlin
between fatal and freewil ha never been quit authorit
settl even by st paul so perhap she wa right mankind doe not
like to admit it but it is at the least a question whether we can
oppos our littl will against the forc of a univers law or
derang the detail of an unvari plan to suit the petti want and
hope of individu mortal jess wa a clever woman but it would
take a wiser head than her to know where or when to draw that red line
across the write of our live
on came the cart and the knot of men then suddenli john look up and
saw her gaze at him with those dark ey that at time did inde
seem as though thei were the window of her soul he turn and said
someth to hi companion and to the zulu mouti who went on with the
cart then he came toward her smile and with outstretch hand

i do not think that anyth could be wors she answer with a stamp
of her foot then quit thrown off her balanc she burst incontin
into a flood of tear
john niel wa a veri simplemind man and it never struck him to
attribut her grief to ani other caus than anxieti at the state of
affair and at her incarcer for an indefinit period in a besieg
town that ran the daili risk of be taken vi et armi still he wa
a littl hurt at the manner of hi recept after hi long and most

air of digniti that wa veri take
thank you he answer simpli ye i think i am a veri lucki
fellow
and now she said we had better go and see about the cart you will
have to find a stand for it in that wretch laager you must be veri
tire and hungri

chapter xvii
the twelfth of februari
john soon settl down into the routin of camp life in pretoria which
after on becam accustom to it wa not so disagre as might
have been expect and possess at ani rate the merit of novelti
although he wa an offic of the armi have sever hors to ride
and hi servic not be otherwis requir john prefer on the
whole to enrol himself in the corp of mount volunt known as
the pretoria carbin thi in the humbl capac of a sergeant he
obtain leav to do from the offic command the troop he wa an
activ man and hi duti in connect with the corp kept him fulli
emploi dure most of the dai and sometim when there wa outpost
duti to be done dure a good part of the night too for the rest
whenev he return to the cartbi which he had stipul he should
be allow to sleep in order to protect jess in case of ani dangerh
alwai found her readi to greet him and everi littl prepar made
for hi comfort that wa possibl under the circumst inde as
time went on thei thought it more conveni to set up their own littl
mess instead of share that of their friend so everi dai thei us to
sit down to breakfast and dine togeth at a littl tabl contriv out
of a packingcas and place under an extemporis tent for all the
world like a young coupl picnick on their honeymoon of cours the
situat wa veri irksom in a wai but it is not to be deni that it
had a charm of it own
to begin with onc thoroughli known jess wa on of the most
delight companion possibl to a man like john niel never till thi
long teteatet at pretoria had he guess how power and origin
wa her mind or how witti she could be when she like there wa a fund
of dry and suggest humour about her which although it would no more
bear be written down than champagn will bear stand in a tumbler
wa veri pleasant to listen to more especi as john soon discov
that he wa the onli person so privileg her friend and relat had
never suspect that jess wa humor anoth thing which struck him
as time went on wa that she wa grow quit handsom she had been
veri pale and thin when he reach pretoria but befor a month wa over
she had becom compar speak stout which wa an enorm
gain to her appear her pale face too gather a faint ting of
colour that came and went caprici like starlight on the water
and her beauti ey grew deeper and more beauti than ever
who would ever have thought that it wa the same girl said mr
nevil to him hold up her hand as she watch jess solemnli
survei a halfcook mutton chop why she us to be such a poor
creatur and now she quit a fine woman and that with thi life
too which is wear me to a shadow and ha halfkil my dear
daughter
i suppos it is be in the open air said john it have never
occur to him that the medicin that wa do jess so much good might
be happi but so it wa after her first struggl came a lull and
then an idea why should she not enjoi hi societi while she could he
had been thrown into her wai through no wish of her she had no desir
to wean him from bessi or if she had the desir it wa on which she
wa far too honour a woman to entertain he wa perfectli innoc
of the whole stori to him she wa the young ladi who happen to be the
sister of the woman he wa go to marri that wa all why should she
not pluck her innoc rose whilst she might jess forgot that the rose
is a flower with a danger perfum and on that is apt to confus the
sens and turn the head so she gave herself full swing and for some
week went nearer to know what happi realli meant than she
ever had befor what a wonder thing is the love of a woman in it
simplic and strength and how it gild all the poor and common thing
of life and even find a joi in servic the prouder the woman the more
delight doe she extract from her selfabas befor her idol onli
not mani women can love like jess and when thei do almost invari
thei make some fatal mistak wherebi the wealth of their affect
is wast or wors still becom a sourc of miseri or shame to
themselv and other
it wa after thei had been incarcer in pretoria for a month that
a bright idea occur to john about a quarter of a mile from the
outskirt of the camp stood a littl hous known probabl on account of
it diminut size as the palati thi cottag like almost everi
other hous in pretoria had been abandon to it fate it owner as
it happen be awai from the town on dai in the cours of a walk
john and jess cross the littl bridg that span the sluit and
went in to inspect the place pass down a path line on either side
with young blue gum thei reach the littl tinroof cottag it
consist of two roomsa bedroom and a goodsiz sittingroom in
which still stood a tabl and a few chair with a stabl and a kitchen
at the back thei went in sat down by the open door and look out the
garden of the cottag slope down toward a vallei on the farther side
of which rose a wood hill to the right too wa a hill cloth in
deep green bush the ground themselv were plant with vine
just now load with bunch of ripen grape and surround by a
beauti hedg of monthli rose that form a blaze of bloom near the
hous too wa a bed of doubl rose some of them exceedingli love
and all flower with a profus unknown in thi countri altogeth
it wa a delight spot and after the nois and glare of the camp
seem a perfect heaven so thei sat there and talk a great deal about
the farm and old sila croft and a littl about bessi
thi is nice said jess present put her hand behind her head
and look out at the bush beyond
ye said john i sai iv got a notion i vote we take up our
quarter heredur the dai i mean of cours we shall have to sleep
in camp but we might eat here you know and you could sit here all
dai it would be as safe as a church for those boer will never try to
storm the town i am sure of that
jess reflect and soon came to the conclus that it would be a
charm plan accordingli next dai she set to work and made the place
as clean and tidi as circumst would allow and thei commenc
housekeep
the upshot of thi arrang wa that thei were thrown more togeth
even than befor meanwhil the sieg drag it slow length along no
new whatev reach the town from outsid but thi did not troubl
the inhabit veri much as thei were sure that collei wa advanc
to their relief and even got up sweepstak as to the date of hi
arriv now and then a sorti took place but as the result attain
were veri small and were not on the whole credit to our arm
perhap the less said about them the better john of cours went out
on these occas and then jess would endur agoni that were all
the wors becaus she wa forc to conceal them she live in constant
terror lest he should be among the kill howev noth happen to
him and thing went on as usual till the twelfth of februari when
an attack wa made on a place call the red hous kraal which wa
occupi by boer near a spot known as the sixmil spruit
the forc which wa a mix on left pretoria befor daybreak and
john went with it he wa rather surpris when on go to the cart in
which jess slept to get some littl thing befor saddl up he found
her sit on the box in the night dew a cup of hot coffe which she
had prepar for him in her hand
what do you mean by thi jess he ask sharpli i will not have you
get up in the middl of the night to make coffe for me
i have not got up she answer quietli i have not been to bed
that make matter wors he exclaim but nevertheless he drank
the coffe and wa glad of it while she sat on the box and watch him
put on your shawl and wrap someth over your head he said the dew
will soak you through look your hair is all wet
present she spoke i wish you would do someth for me john for
she call him john now will you promis
how like a woman he said to ask on to promis a thing without
sai what it is
i want you to promis for bessi sake john
well what is it jess
not to go on thi sorti you know you can easili get out of it if you
like
he laugh you littl silli why not
oh i dont know dont laugh at me becaus i am nervou i am afraid
thatthat someth might happen to you
well he remark consolingli everi bullet ha it billet and if it
doe i dont see that it can be help
think of bessi she said again
look here jess he answer testili what is the good of try to
take the heart out of a fellow like thi if i am go to be shot i
cant help it and i am not go to show the white feather even for
bessi sake so there you ar and now i must be off
you ar quit right john she said quietli i should not have like
to hear you sai anyth differ but i could not help speak
goodby john god bless you and she stretch out her hand which he
took and went
upon my word she ha given me quit a turn reflect john to
himself as the troop crept on through the white mist of dawn i
suppos she think that i am go to be plug perhap i am i wonder
how bessi would take it she would be awfulli cut up but i expect that
she would get over it pretti soon now i dont think that jess would
shake off a thing of that sort in a hurri that is just the differ
between the two the on is all flower and the other is all root
then he fell to wonder how bessi wa and what she wa do and if
she miss him as much as he miss her and so on till hi mind came
back to jess and he reflect what a charm companion she wa and
how thought and kind and breath a secret hope that she would
continu to live with them after thei were marri unconsci thei
had arriv at that point of intimaci innoc in itself when two
peopl becom absolut necessari to each other daili life inde
jess had travel a long wai farther but of thi john wa of cours
ignor he wa still at the former stage and wa not himself awar
how larg a proport of hi daili thought were occupi by thi
darkei girl or how complet her person overshadow him he
onli knew that she had the knack of make him feel thoroughli happi
in her compani when he wa talk to her or even sit silent by
her he becam awar of a sensat of rest and relianc that he
had never befor experienc in the societi of a woman of cours to
a larg extent thi wa the natur homag of the weaker natur to the
stronger but it wa also someth more it wa a shadow of the utter
sympathi and complet accord that is the surest sign of the presenc of
the highest form of affect which when it accompani the passion
of men and women as it sometim though rare doe be more often
to be found in perfect in those relat from which the element of
sexual is exclud rais it almost abov the level of the earth
for the love where that sympathi exist whether it is between mother
and son husband and wife or those who whilst desir it have no
hope of that relationship is an undi love and will endur till the
night of time ha swallow all thing
meanwhil as john reflect the forc to which he wa attach wa
move into action and soon he found it necessari to come down to the
unpleasantli practic detail of boer warfar more particularli did
thi come home to hi mind when shortli afterward the man next to him
wa shot dead and a littl later he himself wa slightli wound by a
bullet which pass between the saddl and hi thigh into the detail
of the fight that ensu it is not necessari to enter here thei were
if anyth more discredit than most of the episod of that
unhappi war in which the hold of potchefstroom lydenburg
rustenburg and wakkerstroom ar the onli bright spot suffic it to
sai that thei end in someth veri like an utter rout of the english
at the hand of a much inferior forc and that a few hour after he
had start the ambul be left in the hand of the boer john
found himself on the return road to pretoria with a sever wound
man behind hi saddl who as thei went painfulli along mingl curs
of shame and furi with hi own meanwhil exagger account of the
english defeat had reach the town and amongst other thing it wa
said that captain niel had been shot dead on man who came in state
that he saw him fall and that he wa shot through the head thi
mr nevil heard with her own ear and greatli shock start to
commun the intellig to jess
as soon as it wa daylight as wa customari with her jess had gone
over to the littl hous which she and john occupi the palati as
it wa call iron and settl herself there for the dai first
she tri to work and could not so she took a book that she had brought
with her and began to read but it wa a failur also her ey would
wander from the page and her ear strain to catch the distant boom of
the big gun that came from time to time float across the hill
the fact of the matter wa that the poor girl wa the victim of a
presenti that someth wa go to happen to john most peopl of
imagin mind have suffer from thi kind of thing at on time or
other in their live and have live to see the folli of it and there
wa more in the circumst of the present case to excus indulg
in the luxuri of presenti than as usual inde as it happen
she wa not far outonli a sixteenth of an inch or sofor john wa
veri nearli kill
not find jess in camp mr nevil made her wai across to the
palati where she knew the girl sat cry as she went at the
thought of the new that she had to commun for the good soul had
grown veri fond of john niel jess with that acut sens of hear
which often accompani nervou excit caught the sound of the
littl gate at the bottom of the garden almost befor her visitor had
pass through it and ran round the corner of the hous to see who wa

on glanc at mr nevil tearstain face wa enough for her she
knew what wa come and clasp at on of the young blue gum tree

jess made no answer but clung to the sapl feel as though she
were go to die herself and faintli hope that she might do so her
ey wander vagu from the face of the messeng of evil first up
to the sky then down to the crop and trodden veldt past the gate of
the palati garden ran a road which as it happen wa a short
cut from the scene of the fight and down thi road came four kafir and
halfcast bear someth on a stretcher behind which rode three
or four carbin a coat wa thrown over the face of the form on the
stretcher but it leg were visibl thei were boot and spur and
the feet fell apart in that peculiarli lax and helpless wai of which
there is no possibl of mistak the mean

some difficulti stagger to the hous where he laid her down upon
the tabl and assist by mr nevil began to do all in hi power to
reviv her so obstin wa her faint howev that their effort were

brandi leav him to go on rub her hand and sprinkl water on

the good ladi had not been gone more than two or three minut when jess
suddenli open her ey and sat up slip her feet to the ground

about to faint again for even her lip blanch and she began to shake
and trembl all over in the extrem of her agit

chapter xviii
and after
in front of the door of the palati wa a gardenb fill with
weed and flower mix up togeth like the good and evil in the
heart of a man and to the righthand side of thi bed stood an old and
backless wooden chair no sooner had john limp outsid the door of
the cottag than he becam sensibl that what between on thing and
anotherweari loss of blood from hi wound and intens mental
emotionif he did not sit down somewher quickli he should follow the
exampl set by jess and faint awai accordingli he steer for the old
chair and sank into it with gratitud present he saw mr nevil
run up the path with a bottl of brandi in her hand
ah he thought to himself that will just come in handi for me if
i dont have a glass of brandi soon i shall roll off thi infern
chairi am sure of it
where is jess pant mr nevil
in there he said she ha recov it would have been better for
us both if she hadnt he ad to himself
why bless me captain niel how queer you look said mr nevil
fan herself with her hat and there is such a row go on at the
camp there the volunt swear that thei will attack the militari
for desert them and i dont know what all and thei simpli wouldnt
believ me when i said you were not shot why i never look your boot
is full of blood so you were hit after all
might i troubl you to give me some brandi mr nevil said john
faintli
she fill a glass she had brought with her half full of water from
a littl irrig furrow that ran down from the main sluit by the
road and then top it up with brandi he drank it and felt decidedli
better
dear me said mr nevil there ar a pair of you now you should
just have seen that girl go down when she saw the bodi come along the
road i made sure that it wa you but it wasnt thei sai that it wa
poor jim smith son of old smith of rustenburg i tell you what it is

will get into troubl which will be rather awkward as you ar go
to marri her sister jess isnt the on to have a bit of a flirt to pass
awai the time and have done with it i can tell you and she shook her
head solemnli as though she suspect him of trifl with hi futur
sisterinlaw young affect then without wait for an answer
she turn and went into the cottag
as for john he onli groan what could he do but groan the thing wa
selfevid and if ever a man felt asham of himself that man wa
john niel he wa a strictli honour individu and it cut him to
the heart to think that he had enter on a cours which consid
hi engag to bessi wa not honour when a few minut befor
he had told jess he love her he had said a disgrac thing howev
true it might be and that wa the worst of it it wa true he did love
her he felt the chang come sweep over him like a wave as she
stood look at him in the room utterli drown and overpow hi
affect for bessi to whom he wa bound by everi tie of honour it
wa a new and a wonder experi thi passion that had arisen within
him as a strong man arm drive everi other affect awai into the
wast place of hi mind and unfortun as he alreadi guess it
wa overmast and endur he curs himself in hi shame and anger
as he sat recov hi equilibrium on the broken chair and ty a
handkerchief tightli round hi wound leg what a fool he had been why
had he not wait to see which of the two he realli love why had
jess gone awai like that and thrown him into temptat with her pretti
sister he wa sure now that she had care for him all along well
there it wa and a bad busi too on thing he wa clear about it
should go no farther he would not break hi engag to bessi it
wa not to be thought of but all the same he felt sorri for himself
and sorri for jess too
just then howev the bandag on hi leg slip and the wound
began to bleed so fast that he wa fain to hobbl into the hous for
assist
jess who had appar quit recov from her agit wa
stand by the tabl talk to mr nevil who wa persuad her
to swallow some of the brandi she had been at such pain to fetch the
moment she caught sight of john face which had now turn ghastli
white and saw the red line trickl down hi boot she took up her hat
that wa ly on the tabl
you had better lie down on the old bedstead in the littl room she
said i am go for the doctor
assist by mr nevil he wa onli too glad to take thi advic but
long befor the doctor arriv john had follow jesss exampl and
gone off into a dead faint to the intens alarm of mr nevil who
wa vainli endeavour to check the flow of blood which had now becom
copiou on the arriv of the doctor it appear that the bullet had
graze the wall of on of the arteri on the insid of hi thigh
without actual cut them which had now given wai render it
necessari to tie the arteri thi oper with the assist
of chloroform he proceed to carri out successfulli announc
afterward that a great deal of blood had alreadi been lost
when at last it wa over mr nevil ask about john be move up to
the hospit but the doctor declar that he must lie where he wa
and that jess must stop and help to nurs him with the assist of a
soldier wife whom he would send to her
dear me said mr nevil that is veri awkward
it will be more awkward if you try to move him at present wa the
grim repli for the silk mai slip in which case the arteri will
probabl break out again and he will bleed to death
as for jess she said noth but set to work to make prepar
for her task of nurs as fate had onc more thrown them togeth she
accept the posit gladli though it is fair to sai that she would
not have sought it
in about an hour time just as john wa begin to recov from the
pain effect of the chloroform the soldier wife who wa to assist
her in nurs arriv as jess soon discov she wa not onli a low
stamp of woman but both careless and ignor into the bargain and all
that she could be reli on to do wa to carri out some of the rougher
work of the sickroom when john woke up and learn whose wa the
presenc that wa bend over him and whose the cool hand that lai
upon hi forehead he groan again and went to sleep but jess did not
go to sleep she sat by him there throughout the night till at last the
cold light of the dawn came gleam through the window and fell upon
the white face of the man she love he wa still sleep soundli and
as the night wa exceedingli hot and oppress she had left noth
but a sheet over him befor she went to rest a littl herself she
turn to look at him onc more and as she look she saw the sheet
grow suddenli red with blood the arteri had broken out fresh
call to the soldier wife to run across to the doctor jess shook
her patient till he awok for he wa sleep quit soundli and would
no doubt have continu to do so till he glide awai into a still
deeper sleep and then between them thei did what thei could to quench
that dread pump flow jess knot her handkerchief round hi
leg and twist it with a stick while he press hi thumb upon the
sever arteri but strive as thei would thei were onli partial
success and jess began to think that he would die in her arm from
loss of blood it wa agonis to wait there minut after minut and
see hi life eb awai
i dont think i shall last much longer jess god bless you dear he
said the place is begin to go round and round
poor soul she could onli set her teeth and wait for the end
present john pressur on the wound arteri relax and he
faint off and oddli enough just then the flow of blood diminish
consider anoth five minut and she heard the quick step of the
doctor come up the path
thank god you have come he ha bled dreadfulli
i wa out attend a poor fellow who wa shot through the lung and
that fool of a woman wait for me to come back instead of follow me
i have brought you an orderli in place of her by jove he ha bled
i suppos the silk ha slip well there is onli on thing for it
orderli the chloroform
then follow anoth long halfhour of slash and ty and horror
and when at last the unfortun john open hi ey again he wa too
weak to speak and could onli smile feebli for three dai after thi he
lai in a danger state for if the arteri had broken out for the third
time the chanc were that have so littl blood left in hi vein
he would die befor anyth could be done for him at time he wa veri
deliri from weak and these were the critic hour for it wa
almost imposs to keep him still and everi moment threw jess into
an agoni of terror lest the silk fasten of the arteri should break
awai inde there wa onli on fashion in which she could quiet him
and that wa by place her slim white hand upon hi forehead or give
it to him to hold oddli enough thi had more effect upon hi fever
mind than anyth els for hour after hour she would sit thu though
her arm ach and her back felt as if it were about to break in two
till at last she wa reward by see hi wild ey ceas their
wander and close in peac sleep
yet with it all that week wa perhap the happiest time in her life
there he lai the man she love with all the intens of her deep
natur and she minist to him and felt that he love her and
depend on her as a babe upon it mother even in hi delirium her
name wa continu on hi lip and gener with some endear term
befor it she felt in those dark hour of doubt and sick as though
thei two were grow life to life knit up in a divin ident she
could not analys or understand she felt that it wa so and she
believ that onc be so whatev her futur might be that
communion could never be dissolv and therefor wa she happi though
she knew that hi recoveri meant their lifelong separ for though
jess when thrown utterli off her balanc had onc given her passion
wai it wa not a thing she meant to repeat she had she knew injur
bessi enough alreadi in take her futur husband heart that she
could not help now but she would take no more john should go back to
her sister
and so she sat and gaze at that sleep man through the long watch
of the night and wa happi there lai her joi soon thei must part and
she would be left desol but whilst he lai there he wa her it wa
pass sweet to her woman natur to place her hand upon him and see
him sleep for thi desir to watch the sleep of a belov object is on
of the highest and strangest manifest of passion truli and with
a keen insight into the human heart ha the poet said that there is no
joi like the joi of a woman watch what she love asleep as jess sat
and gaze those beauti and tender line came float to her mind
and she thought how true thei were
for there it li so tranquil so belov
all that it hath of life with us is live
so gentl stirless helpless and unmov
and all unconsci of the joi ti give
all it hath felt inflict pass and prove
hush into depth beyond the watcher dive
there li the thing we love with all it error
and all it charm like death without it terror
ay there lai the thing she love
the time went on and the arteri broke out no more then at last came
a morn when john open hi ey and watch the pale earnest
face bend over him as though he were try to rememb someth
present he shut them again he had rememb
i have been veri ill jess he said after a paus
ye john
and you have nurs me
ye john
am i go to recov
of cours you ar
he close hi ey again
i suppos there is no new from outsid
no more thing ar just the same
nor from bessi
none we ar quit cut off
then came a paus
john said jess i want to sai someth to you when peopl ar
deliri or when delirium is come on thei sometim sai thing that
thei ar not respons for and which had better be forgotten
ye he said i understand
so she went on in the same measur tone we will forget everyth
you mai fanci that you said or that i did sinc the time when you came
in wound and found that i had faint
quit so said john i renounc them all
we renounc them all she correct and gave a solemn littl nod
of her head and sigh and thu thei ratifi that audaci compact of
oblivion
but it wa a lie and thei both knew that it wa a lie if love had
exist befor wa there anyth in hi helpless and her long and
tender care to make it less ala no rather wa their companionship
the more perfect and their sympathi the more complet propinqu
sir propinqu as the wise man saidw all know the evil of it
it wa a lie and a veri common and everydai sort of lie who be
behind the scene ha not laugh in hi sleev to see it actedwho
ha not admir and wonder at the cold and formal bow and shake of the
hand the tender inquiri after the health of the maiden aunt and the
babi the carelessli express wish that we mai meet somewhereal so
palpabl overdon that the heroin of the impass scene at which
we had unfortun to assist an hour ago where ar the tear the
convuls sob the heartbroken grief and that the young gentleman
who saw noth for it but flight or a pistol bullet there all the
world a stage and fortun most of us can act at a pinch
ye we can act we can paint the face and powder the hair and summon
up the set smile and the regul joke and make pretens that thing
ar as thing were when thei ar as differ as the north pole from
the torrid zone but unfortun or fortunatelyi do not know
whichw cannot bedeck our inner selv and make them mime as the
occas pleas and sing the old song when their lip ar set to a
strang new chant of a sureti there is within us a spark of the etern
truth for in our own heart we cannot lie and so it wa with these
two from that dai forward thei forgot that scene in the sittingroom of
the palati when jess put out her strength and john bent and broke
befor it like a reed befor the wind sure it wa a part of the
delirium thei forgot that now ala thei love each other with a love
which did but gather forc from it despair thei talk of bessi and
of john marriag and discuss jesss plan to go to europ just
as though these were not matter of spiritu life and death to each
of them in short howev for on brief moment thei might have gone
astrai now to their honour be it said thei follow the path of duti
with unflinch feet nor did thei complain when the stone cut them
but it wa a live lie and thei knew it for behind them stood the
irrevoc past who for good or evil had bound them togeth in hi
unchang bond and with cord that never can be broken
chapter xix
han coetze come to pretoria
onc he had turn the corner john recoveri wa rapid natur of a
vigor constitut when the arteri had reunit he soon made up
for the great loss of blood which he had undergon and in a littl more
than a month from the date of hi wound physic wa almost as good a
man as ever
on morningit wa the 20th of marchjess and he were sit in the
palati garden john wa ly in a lone cane deck chair that jess
had borrow or stolen out of on of the desert hous and smoke
a pipe by hi side in a hole in the flat arm of the chair fashion
origin to receiv a sodawat tumbler wa a great bunch of purpl
grape which she had gather for him and on hi knee lai a copi of
that journalist curios the new of the camp which wa chiefli
remark for it utter dearth of new it wa not easi to run a
journal in a beleagu town
thei sat in silenc john puf awai at hi pipe and jess her
workon of hi socksli idli upon her knee her hand clasp
over it and her ey fix upon the light and shadow that plai with
broad finger upon the wood slope beyond
so silent did thei sit that a great green lizard came and bask
himself in the sun within a yard of them and a beauti stripe
butterfli perch deliber upon the purpl grape it wa a
delight dai and a delight spot thei were too far from the camp to
be disturb by it rude nois and the onli sound that reach their
ear were the rippl of run water and the whisper of the wind
odor with the breath of mimosa bloom as it stir the stiff grei
leav on the blue gum
thei were seat in the shade of the littl hous that jess had learn
to love as she had never love a spot befor but around them lai the
flood of sunshin shimmer like golden water and beyond the red line
of the fenc at the end of the garden where the rich pomegran bloom
tri to blush the rose down the hot air danc merrili abov the
rough stone wall like a million microscop elv at plai peac
everywher wa peac and in it the full heart of natur beat out in
radiant life peac in the voic of the turtledov among the willow
peac in the plai of the sunshin and the murmur of the wind peac
in the grow flower and hover butterfli jess look out at the
wealth and glori which were spread befor her and thought that it wa
like heaven then give wai to the melancholi strain in her natur
she began to wonder idli how mani human be had sat and thought the
same thing and had been gather up into the azur of the past and
forgotten and how mani would sit and think there when she in her turn
had been utterli swept awai into that gulf whenc no echo ever come
but what did it matter the sunshin would still flood the earth with
gold the water would rippl and the butterfli hover and there would
be other women to sit and fold their hand and consid them think
the same ident thought beyond which our human intellig cannot
travel and so on for thousand upon thousand of centuri till at
last the old world reach it journei appoint end and pass
from the starri space is swallow up with those it bore
and shewher would she be would she still live on and love and
suffer elsewher or wa it all a cruel myth wa she mere a creatur
bred of the teem earth or had she an individu beyond the earth
what await her after sunsetsleep she had often hope that it wa
sleep and noth but sleep but now she did not hope that her life
had centr itself around a new interest and on that she felt could
never die while that life last she hope for a futur now for if
there wa a futur for her there would be on for him and then her
dai would come and where he wa there she would be also oh sweet
mockeri old and unsubstanti thought bright dream set halowis about
the dull head of life who ha not dream it but who can believ in
it and yet who shall sai that it is not true though philosoph and
scientist smile and point in deris to the gross fact and freak
that mark our passion is it not possibl that there mai be a place
where the love shall live when the lust ha di and where jess will
find that she ha not sat in vain in the sunshin throw out her pure
heart toward the light of a happi and a vision glori whereof for
some few minut the shadow seem to lie within her
john had finish hi pipe and although she did not know it wa
watch her face which now when she wa off her guard wa no longer
impass but seem to mirror the tender and gloriou hope that wa
float through her mind her lip were slightli part and her wide
ey were full of a soft strang light while on the whole counten
wa stamp a look of eager thought and spiritualis desir such as he
had known portrai in ancient masterpiec upon the face of the
virgin mother except as regard her ey and hair jess wa not even a
goodlook person but at that moment john thought that her face wa
touch with a divin beauti than he had yet seen on the face of
woman it thrill him and appeal to him not as bessi beauti had
appeal but to that other side of hi natur of which jess alon
could turn the kei it wa more like the face of a spirit than that of a
human be and it almost frighten him to see it
jess he said at last what ar you think of
she start and her face resum it normal express it wa as
though a mask had been suddenli set upon it
why do you ask she said
becaus i want to know i never saw you look like that befor
she laugh a littl
you would call me foolish if i told you what i wa think about

place my uncl and bessi must be half distract

far off suggest john for these foolish peopl in pretoria labour
under a firm belief that on fine morn thei would be gratifi with a
vision of the light danc down a long line of british bayonet and of
boer evapor in everi direct like storm cloud befor the sun
jess shook her head she wa begin to lose faith in reliev
column that never came

just then who should arriv but mr nevil in a great state of
excit and as usual fan herself with her hat
what do you think captain niel the prison have come in and i

boer gener for some english peopl and that he wa come over to see

then she turn and enter the hous again
mouti said john to the zulu who wa loung about in a wai
characterist of that intellig but unindustri race inspan the
hors we ar go back to mooifontein
koo said the zulu unconcernedli and start on the errand as
though it were the most everydai occurr to drive off home out of a
close beleagu town that is anoth beauti of the zulu race you
cannot astonish them no doubt thei consid that extraordinari mixtur
of wisdom and insan the white man to be capabl du tout as the
agnost french critic said in despair of the prophet zerubbabel
john stood and watch the inspan absent in truth he too wa
consciou of a sensat of regret he felt asham of himself for it
but there it wa he wa sorri to leav the place for the last week or
so he had been live in a dream and everyth outsid that dream wa
blur indistinct as a landscap in a fog he knew the object
were there but he could not quit appreci their rel size and
posit the onli real thing wa hi dream all els wa as vagu as
those faroff peopl and event that we lose in infanc and find again
in old ag
now there would be an end of dream the fog would lift and he must
face the fact jess with whom he had dream would go awai to europ
and he would marri bessi and all thi pretoria busi would glide
awai into the past like a watch in the night well it must be so it
wa right and proper that it should be so and he for on would not
flinch from hi duti but he must have been more than human had he not
felt the pang of awaken it wa all so veri unfortun
by thi time mouti had got up the hors and ask if he wa to inspan
no wait a bit said john veri like it is all nonsens he ad
to himself
scarc were the word out of hi mouth when he caught sight of two
arm boer of a peculiarli unpleas type and rough appear ride
across the veldt toward the palati gate with them wa an escort
of four carbin at the gate thei all stop and on of the boer
dismount and walk to where john wa stand by the stabledoor
captain niel he said interrog in english

it wa in the same handwrit as the letter but sign by the boer
gener
john examin it and then call to jess to come to translat it who
have heard the voic of the boer wa on her wai round the corner of
the hous
it mean pass the bearer unharm she said and the signatur is
genuin i have seen paul kruger signatur befor
when must we start ask john of the boer
at onc or not at all
i must drive round by the headquart camp to explain my departur
thei will think that i have run awai
to thi the boer demur but final after go to the gate to
consult hi companion he consent and the two rode back to the
headquart camp sai that thei would wait for the cart there
whereupon the hors were inspan
in five minut everyth wa readi and the cart wa stand on the
roadwai in front of the littl gate after he had look to all the
strap and buckl and seen that the baggag wa properli pack john
went to call jess he found her by the doorstep look out at her
favourit view her hand wa place sidewai against her forehead as
though to shade her ey from the sun but where she wa stand there
wa no sun and john could not help guess why she wa shade her
ey she wa cry at leav the place in that quiet and harrow
wai which some women indulg in that is to sai a few big tear were
roll down her face john felt a lump rise in hi own throat at the
sight and not unnatur reliev hi feel by rough languag
what the deuc ar you after he ask ar you go to keep the
hors stand all dai
jess did not resent thi the probabl is that she guess it
reason besid it is a melancholi fact that women rather like be
sworn at than otherwis provid that the swearer is the man whom thei
ar attach to but he must onli swear on state occas at thi
moment too mr nevil plung out of the hous lick an envelop
as she ran
there she said i hope you werent wait for me i havent told
the old gentleman half the new in fact iv onli taken him down to

etern there goodby my dear god bless you when you get out of

in anoth minut thei were in the cart and mouti wa scrambl up
behind

what cant be cure must be endur

at the headquart camp john went in and explain the circumst of
hi departur at first the offic who wa temporarili in commandth
command have been wound at the same time that john wa
hitrath demur to hi go especi when he learn that he
had pass hi word not to carri despatch present howev he
thought better of it and said he suppos that it wa all right as
he could not see that their departur could do the garrison ani harm
rather the revers in fact becaus you can tell peopl how we ar
get on in thi godforsaken hole i onli wish that somebodi would
give me a pass that all so john shook hand with him and left to
find an eager crowd gather outsid
the new of their good luck had gone abroad and everybodi wa run
down to hear the truth of it such an event as a departur out of
pretoria had not happen for a coupl of month and more and the

whereupon the weaselfac individu utter a howl of wrath and
pretend to make a rush at the author of these random gibe wait
halfwai for somebodi to stop him and prevent a breach of the peac
oh miss croft cri out a woman in the crowd who like jess had
been trap in pretoria while on a fly visit if you can do send a
line to my husband at maritzburg to tell him that i am well except for
the rheumat from sleep on the wet ground and tell him to kiss the

worthi on of them wa a big smooth pastyfac man with a
peculiarli villain express of counten and a promin tooth
that project in ghastli isol over hi lower lip the other wa
a small man with a sardon smile a profus of black beard and
whisker on hi face and long hair hang on to hi shoulder inde
when he smile more vigor than usual hi eyebrow came down and
hi whisker advanc and hi moustach went up till there wa scarc
ani face left and he look more like a great beard monkei than

of the fine cut cruel mouth suddenli howev hi gaze lit upon the
two boer on of whom wa pick hi teeth with a steel fork and

frank muller made no answer in word he simpli took on step forward

athlet frame sent him fly headlong through the door so that thi
free and independ burgher lit upon hi head in the passag smash

hi temper had endang the success of hi plan curs the fellow
he said to himself he is what those english call a gentleman it wa
brave of him to refus to take my hand when he is in my power
john said jess as soon as the door had close i am afraid of that
man if i had understood that he had anyth to do with the pass i
would not have taken it i thought that the write wa familiar to me
oh dear i wish we had stop at pretoria
what cant be cure must be endur said john again the onli thing
to do is to make the best of it and get on as we can you will be
all right anyhow but he hate me like poison i suppos that it is on
account of bessi

muller wa right the storm wa come up fast throw a veil of inki
cloud across the starspangl sky in south africa there is but littl
twilight and the dark follow hard upon the heel of the dai no
sooner had the angri ball of the set sun disappear than the night
swept with all her star across the sky and now after her came the
great storm cover up her beauti with hi black the air wa
stiflingli hot abov wa a starri space to the east the black bosom
of the storm in which the lightn were alreadi plai with
an incess flicker movement and to the west a deep red glow
reflect from the sunken sun yet linger on the horizon
on toil the hors through the gather gloom fortun the road
wa almost level and free from mudhol and frank muller rode just
ahead to show the wai hi strong athlet form stand out clearli
against the depart western glow silent wa the earth silent as
death no bird or beast no blade of grass or breath of air stir upon
it surfac the onli sign of life wa the continu flicker of those
aw tongu of light as thei lick the lip of the storm on for mile
after mile on through the desol thei were not far from the river
now and could hear the distant growl of the thunder echo down it
solemnli
it wa an aw night great pillar of mudcolour cloud came creep
across the surfac of the veldt toward them seemingli blown along
without a wind now too a ghastlylook ring moon aros throw
an unholi and distort light upon the black that seem to shudder
in her rai as though with a prescienc of the advanc terror on
crept the mudcolour column and on abov them and rest on them
came the mutter storm the cart wa quit close to the river now and
thei could distinguish the murmur of it water to their left stood
a koppi cover with white slablik stone on which the sickli
moonbeam danc
look john look cri jess with an hyster laugh it is like
a huge graveyard and the dark shadow between ar the ghost of the
buri
nonsens said john sternli why do you talk such rubbish
he felt that her mind had lost it balanc and what is more hi own
nerv were shaken therefor he wa natur the angrier with her and
the more determin to be perfectli matteroffact
jess made no answer but she wa frighten she could not tell why the
scene resembl that of some aw dream or of on of dore pictur
come to life no doubt also the near presenc of the tempest exercis
a physic effect upon her even the weari hors snort and shook
themselv uneasili
thei crept over the ridg of a wave of land and the wheel roll
softli on the grass
why we ar off the road shout john to muller who wa still
guid them fifteen or twenti pace ahead
all right all right it is a short cut to the ford he call in
answer and hi voic rang strang and hollow through the great depth
of the silenc
below them a hundr yard awai the light such as it wa gleam
faintli upon the wide surfac of the river anoth five minut and
thei were on the bank but in the gather doom thei could not see the
opposit shore
turn to the left shout muller the ford is a few yard up it is
too deep here for the hors
john turn accordingli and follow muller hors some three hundr
yard up the bank till thei came to a spot where the water ran with an
angri music and there wa a great swirl of eddi
here is the place said muller you must make hast through the
hous is just the other side and it will be better to get there befor
the tempest break
it is all veri well said john but i cannot see an inch befor me i
dont know where to drive
drive straight ahead the water is not more than three feet deep and
there ar no rock
i am not go and that is all about it
you must go captain niel you cannot stop here and if you can we will
not look there man and he point to the east which now present a
truli aw and magnific sight
down right on to them it centr bow out like the belli of a sail by
the weight of the wind behind swept the great stormcloud while
over all it surfac the lightn plai unceasingli appear and
disappear in needl of fire and twist and writh serpentwis
round and about it outer edg so brilliant wa the intermitt light
that it appear to fire the revolv pillar of mudcolour cloud
beneath and gave ghastli peep of river and bank and plain mile
upon mile awai but perhap it most aw circumst wa the
preternatur silenc the distant boom and mutter of thunder had
di awai and now the great storm swept on in voiceless majesti like
the passag of a ghostli host from which there aros no sound of feet
or of roll wheel onli befor it sped the swift angel of the wind
and behind it swung the curtain of the rain
even as muller spoke a gust of ici air caught the cart and tilt it
and the lightn needl began to ply more dreadfulli than ever the
tempest wa break upon them
come drive on drive on he shout you will be kill here the
lightn alwai strike along the water and as he said it he struck
on of the wheeler sharpli with hi whip
climb over the back of the seat mouti and stand by to help me with
the rein call out john to the zulu who obei scrambl between
him and jess
now jess hold on and sai your prayer for it strike me that we
shall have need of them so hors so
the hors back and plung but muller on the on side and the
smoothfac boer on the other lash them without merci and at last
thei went into the river with a rush the gust had pass now and for
a few moment the heavi quiet wa renew except for the whirl of the
water and the snakelik hiss of the come rain
for some yard ten or fifteen perhap all went well and then john
discov suddenli that thei were drive into deep water the two
leader were evid almost off their leg and could scarc stand
against the current of the flood river
damn you he shout back there is no drift here
go on go on it is quit safe came muller voic in answer
john said no more but put out all hi strength he tri to drag
the hors round jess turn herself on the seat to look and just then
a blaze of lightn flame which reveal muller and hi two companion
stand dismount on the bank the muzzl of their rifl point
straight at the cart
o god she scream thei ar go to shoot us
even as the word pass her lip three tongu of fire flare from the
rifl mouth and the zulu mouti sit by her side pitch heavili
forward on to hi head into the bottom of the cart while on of the
wheeler rear straight up into the air with a shriek of agoni and
fell with a splash into the river
then follow a scene of horror indescrib overhead the storm burst
in furi and flash after flash of fork or rather chain lightn leapt
into the river the thunder too began to crack like the trump of doom
the wind rush down tear the surfac of the water into foam and
catch under the tent of the cart lift it quit off the wheel so
that it began to float then the two leader made mad with fear by the
furi of the storm and the dy struggl of the offwheel plung
and tore at the trace till at last thei rent themselv loos and
vanish between the dark overhead and the boil water beneath
awai float the cart now touch the bottom and now ride on the
river like a boat oscil thi wai and that and slowli turn
round and round with it float the dead hors drag down the other
wheeler beneath the water it wa aw to see hi struggl in the
glare of the lightn but at last he sank and choke
meanwhil sound sharpli and clearli through the din and hubbub of
the storm came the crack of the three rifl whenev the flash
show the posit of the cart to the murder on the bank mouti wa
ly still in the bottom of it on the bedplank a bullet between hi
broad shoulder and anoth in hi skull but john felt that hi life
wa yet whole in him though someth had hiss past hi face and
stung it instinct he reach across the cart and drew jess on to
hi knee and cower over her think dimli that perhap hi bodi
would protect her from the bullet
rip rip through the wood and canva phut phut through the air
but some merci power protect them and though on cut john coat
and two pass through the skirt of jesss dress not a bullet struck
them veri soon the shoot began to grow wild then that dens veil of
rain came down and wrap them so close that even the lightn could
not reveal their whereabout to the assassin on the bank
stop shoot said frank muller the cart ha sunk and there is
an end of them no human be can have live through that fire and the
vaal in flood
the two boer ceas fire and the unicorn shook hi head softli and
remark to hi companion that the damn english peopl in the water
could not be much wetter than thei were on the bank it wa a curiou
thing to sai at such a moment but probabl the spirit which caus the
remark wa not so much callous as that which anim cromwel who
flip the ink in hi neighbour face when he sign the deathwarr
of hi king
the vilderbeest made no repli hi conscienc wa oppress he had a
touch of imagin he thought of the soft finger which had bound up
hi head that morn the handkerchiefh handkerchiefwa still
around it now those finger would be grip at the slipperi stone of
the vaal in a struggl for life or more probabl thei were alreadi limp
in death with littl grain of gravel stick beneath the nail
it wa a pain thought but he consol himself by rememb the
warrant also by the reflect that whoever had shot the peopl he had
not for he had been care to fire wide of the cart everi time
muller wa also think of the warrant which he had forg he must get
it back somehow even if
let us take shelter under the shore there is a flat place about fifti
yard up where the bank hang down thi rain is drown us we cant
upsaddl till it clear i must have a nip of brandi too almighti
i can see that girl face still the lightn shone on it just as i
shot well she will be in heaven now poor thing if english peopl
ever go to heaven
it wa the unicorn who spoke and the vilderbeest made no repli but
advanc with him to where the hors stood thei caught the patient
brute that were wait for their master their head well down and
the water stream from their flank and led them along with them
frank muller stood by hi own hors still think and watch them
vanish into the gloom how wa he to win that warrant back without dy
hi hand even redder than thei were
as he thought an answer came for at that moment accompani by a
fear thunderclap there shot from the storm overhead which had now
nearli pass awai on of those aw flash that sometim end an
african tempest it lit up the scene with a light vivid as that of dai
and in the white heart of it muller saw hi two companion in crime and
their hors as the great king saw the men in the furnac thei were
about forti pace from him on the crest of the bank he saw them on
moment erect the nextmen and hors fall thi wai and that prone
to the earth then it wa dark again
muller stagger with the shock and when it had pass he rush to the
spot call the men by name but no answer came except the echo of
hi voic he wa there alon now and the moonlight began to struggl
faintli through the rain it pale beam lit upon two outstretch
formson ly on it back it distort featur gaze up to
heaven the other on it face by them the leg of the nearer stick
straight into the air lai the hors thei had all gone to their
account the lightn had kill them as it kill mani a man in
africa
frank muller look then forget about the warrant and everyth
els in the horror of what he took to be a visibl judgment he rush
to hi hors and gallop wildli awai pursu by all the terror of
hell
chapter xxiv
the shadow of death
the fire from the bank had ceas and john who still kept hi head
be a rather phlegmat specimen of the anglosaxon race knew that
for the moment at ani rate all danger from thi sourc wa end jess
lai perfectli still in hi arm her head upon hi breast a horribl
idea struck him that she might be shot perhap alreadi dead
jess jess he shout through the turmoil of the storm ar you
hit
she lift her head an inch or twoi think not she said what is
go on
god onli know i dont sit still it will be all right
but in hi heart he knew it wa not all right and that thei stood in
immin danger of death by drown thei were whirl down a rage
river in a cart in a few moment it wa probabl that the cart would
upset and then
present the wheel bump against someth the cart gave a great
lurch and scrape along a littl
now for it thought john for the water wa pour over the floor
then came a check and the cart leant still farther to on side
crack the pole had gone and the cart swung round bow or rather
box on to the stream what had happen wa thi thei had drift
across a rock that project from the bed of the river the forc of the
current have wash the dead hors to the on side of it and the cart
to the other consequ thei were anchor to the rock as it were
the anchor be the dead hors and the cabl the stout trace of
untan leather so long as these trace and the rest of the har
held thei were safe from drown but of cours thei did not know
thi
inde thei knew noth abov them roll the storm about them the
river seeth and the rain hiss thei knew noth except that thei
were helpless live atom toss between the wild water and the
wilder night with immin death stare them in the face around
abov and below to and fro thei rock lock fast in each other
arm and as thei swung came that aw flash that though thei guess
it not sent two of the murder to their account and for an instant
even through the sheet of rain illumin the space of boil water and
the long line of the bank on either side it show the point of rock
to which thei were fix it glare upon the head of on of the poor
hors toss up by the drive current as though it were still try
to escap it wateri doom and reveal the form of the dead zulu
mouti ly on hi face on arm hang over the edg of the cart and
dabbl in the water that ran level with it in ghastli similar to
some idl passeng in a pleasur boat who let hi finger slip softli
through the stream
in a second it wa gone and onc more thei were in dark then by
degre the storm pass off and the moon began to shine feebli inde
for the sky wa not clear wash of cloud which still trail along in
the track of the tempest suck after it by it mighti draught still
it wa lighter and the rain thin gradual till at last it stop
the storm had roll in majesti down the wai of night and there wa no
sound round them save the sound of rush water
john said jess present can we do anyth
noth dear
shall we escap john
he hesit it is in god hand dear we ar in great danger if
the cart upset we shall be drown can you swim
no john
if we can hang on here till daylight we mai get ashor if those devil
ar not there to shoot us i do not think that our chanc is a good
on
john ar you afraid to die
he hesit i dont know dear i hope to meet it like a man
tell me what you truli think is there ani hope for us at all
onc more he paus reflect whether or no he should speak the truth
final he decid to do so
i can see none jess if we ar not drown we ar sure to be shot
thei will wait about the bank till morn and for their own sake thei
will not dare to let us live
he did not know that all which wa left of two of them would inde wait
for mani a long year while the third had fled aghast
jess dear he went on it is of no good to tell li our live mai
end ani minut humanli speak thei must end befor the sun is up
the word were aw enoughif the reader can by an effort of
imagin throw himself for a moment into the posit of these two
he will understand how aw
it is a dread thing when in the flow of health and youth suddenli
to be place face to face with the certainti of violent death and to
know that in a few more minut your cours will have been run and that
you will have commenc to explor a futur which mai prove to be even
wors becaus more endur than the life you ar now quit in
agoni it is a dread thing as ani who have ever stood in such
a peril can testifi and john felt hi heart sink within him at
the thought of itfor death is veri strong but there is on thing
stronger a woman perfect love against which death himself cannot
prevail and so it came to pass that now as he fix hi cold gaze upon
jesss ey thei answer him with a strang unearthli light she fear
not death so that she might meet him with her belov death wa her
hope and opportun here she had noth there she might have all
the fetter had fallen from her struck off by an overmast hand
her duti wa satisfi her trust fulfil and she wa freefre to
die with her belov ay her love wa inde a love deeper than the
grave and now it rose in eager strength stand expect upon the
earth readi when dissolut had lent it wing to soar to it own
predestin star
you ar sure john she ask again
ye dear ye why do you forc me to repeat it i can see no hope
her arm were round hi neck her soft curl rest on hi cheek and
the breath from her lip plai upon hi brow inde it wa onli by
speak into each other ear that convers wa possibl ow to
the rush sound of the water
becaus i have someth to tell you which i cannot tell unless we ar
go to die you know it but i want to sai it with my own lip befor
i die i love you john i love you i love you and i am glad to die
becaus i can die with you and go awai with you
he heard and such wa the power of her love that hi which had been
put out of mind in the terror of that hour reawok and took the colour
of her own he too forgot the immin of death in the warm presenc of
hi downtrodden passion she wa in hi arm as he had taken her dure
the fire and he bent hi head to look at her the moonlight plai
upon her pallid quiver face and show that in her ey which no
man could look upon and turn awai onc morey even thenther came
over him that feel of utter surrend to the sweet masteri of her
will which had possess him in the sittingroom of the palati
onli all earthli consider have fade into nothing now he no
longer hesit but press hi lip to her and kiss her again and
yet again it wa perhap as wild and pathet a love scene as ever the
old moon abov ha wit there thei clung those two in the actual
shadow of death experienc the fullest and acutest joi that our life
ha to offer nai death wa present with them for beneath their veri
feet halfhidden by the water lai the stiffen corps of the zulu
to and fro swung the cart in the rush of the swollen river up and down
besid them the carcas of the hors rose and fell with the surg of
the water on whose surfac the broken moonbeam plai and quiver
overhead wa the blue starsown depth through which thei were wait
present to pass and to the right and left the long broken outlin of
the bank stretch awai till at last thei appear to grow togeth in
the gloom
but thei heed none of these thing thei rememb noth except
that thei had found each other heart and were happi with a wild joi
it is not often given to us to feel the past wa forgotten the futur
loom at hand and between the on and the other wa span a bridg
of passion made perfect and sanctifi by it approach earthli end
bessi wa forgotten all thing were forgotten for thei were alon
with love and death
let those who would blame them paus awhil why not thei had kept the
faith thei had deni themselv and run straightli down the path of
duti but the compact of life end with life no man mai bargain for the
beyond even the marriag servic shrink from it and now that hope had
gone and life wa at it extremest ebb why should thei not take their
joi befor thei pass to the land where perchanc such thing will be
forgotten so it seem to them if inde thei were ani longer capabl
of reason
he look into her ey and she laid her head upon hi heart in that
mute abandon of worship which is sometim to be met with in the
world and is redeem from vulgar passion by an indefin qualiti of
it own he look into her ey and wa glad to have live ay even to
have reach thi hour of death and she lost in the abyss of her deep
natur sob out her loveladen heart upon hi breast and call him
her own her own her veri own
thu the long hour pass unheed till at last a newborn fresh
in the air told them that thei were not far from dawn the death thei
were await had not found them it must now be veri near at hand
john she whisper in hi ear do you think that thei will shoot
us
ye he answer hoars thei must for their own sake
i wish it were over she said
suddenli she start back from hi arm with a littl cry caus the
cart to rock violent
i forgot she said you can swim though i cannot why should you
not swim to the bank and escap under cover of the dark it is onli
fifti yard and the current is not so veri swift
the idea of flight without jess had never occur to john and now
that she suggest it it struck him as so absurd that he broke into the
ghost of a laugh
dont be foolish jess he said
ye ye i will go you must go it doe not matter about me now
i know that you love me and i can die happi i will wait for you oh
john wherev i am if i have ani individu life and ani remembr
i will wait for you never forget that all your dai howev far i mai
seem awai if i live at all i shall be wait for you and now go
you shall go i sai no i will not be disobei if you will not go i
will throw myself into the water oh the cart is turn over
hold on for god sake shout john the trace have broken
he wa right the tough leather wa at length worn through by constant
rub against the rock and the strain and swai of the dead hors on
the on side and of the cart upon the other round it spun broadsid
on to the current and immedi began to heav over till at last
the angl wa so sharp that the dead bodi of poor mouti slid out with
a splash and vanish into the dark thi reliev the cart and it
right for a moment but now be no longer held up by the bodi of
the hors or by the sustain power of the wind it began to fill and
sink and at the same time to revolv swiftli john understood that
all wa finish and that to stop in the cart would onli mean certain
death becaus thei would be held under water by the canva tent so
with a devout aspir for assist he seiz jess round the waist
with on arm and sprang off into the river as he leapt the cart fill
and sank
lie still for heaven sake he shout when thei rose to the
surfac
in the dim light of the dawn which wa now creep over the earth he
could discov the line of the left bank of the vaal the same from
which thei had been driven into the river on the previou night it
appear to be about forti yard awai but the current wa run
quit six knot and he saw that burden as he wa it would be quit
impractic for him to reach it the onli thing to do wa to keep
afloat luckili the water wa warm and he wa a strong swimmer in a
minut or so he saw that about fifti pace ahead some rock jut out
twenti yard into the bed of the stream then catch jess by the hair
with hi left hand he made hi effort and a desper on it wa the
broken water boil furious round the rock present he wa in it
and better still hi feet touch the ground next second he wa swept
off them and roll over and over at the bottom of the river to be
sadli knock about against the boulder somehow he struggl to hi
leg still retain hi hold of jess twice he fell and twice he
struggl up again on more effortso the water wa onli up to hi
thigh now and he wa oblig to half carri hi companion
as he lift her he felt a deadli sick come over him but still
he stagger on till at last thei both fell of a heap upon a big flat
rock and for a while he rememb no more
when he came to himself again it wa to see jess who had recov
sooner than he had stand over him and chafe hi hand inde
as the sun wa up he guess that he must have lost hi sens for some
time he rose with difficulti and shook himself except for some bruis
he wa sound enough
ar you hurt he ask of jess who pale faint and bruis her hat
gone her dress torn by bullet and the rock and drip water at
everi step look an exceedingli forlorn object
no she said feebli not veri much
he sat down on the rock in the sun for thei were both shiver with
cold what is to be done he ask
die she said fierc i meant to diewhi did you not let me die
our is a posit that onli death can set straight
dont be alarm he said your desir will soon be gratifi those
murder villain will hunt us up present
the bed and bank of the river were cloth with thin layer of mist
but as the sun gather power these lift the spot at which thei had
climb ashor wa about three hundr yard below that where the
two boer and their hors had been destroi by the lightn on the
previou night see the mist thin john insist upon jess crouch
with him behind a rock so that thei could look up and down the river
without be seen themselv present he made out the form of two
hors graze about a hundr yard awai
ah he said i thought so the devil have offsaddl there thank
heaven i have still got my revolv and the cartridg ar watertight
i mean to sell our live as dearli as i can
why john cri jess follow the line of hi outstretch hand
those ar not the boer hors thei ar our two leader that broke
loos in the water look their collar ar still on
by jove so thei ar now if onli we can catch them without be
caught ourselv we have a chanc of get out of thi
well there is no cover about and i cant see ani sign of boer thei
must have been sure of have kill us and gone awai jess answer
john look round and for the first time a sens of hope began to creep
into hi heart perhap thei would surviv after all
let go up and look it is no good stop here we must get food
somewher or we shall faint
she rose without a word and take hi hand thei advanc togeth
along the bank thei had not gone twenti yard befor john utter an
exclam of joi and rush at someth white that had lodg in
the reed it wa the basket of food which wa given to them by the
innkeep wife at heidelberg that had been wash out of the cart and
as the lid wa fasten noth wa lost out of it he undid it there
wa the bottl of threestar brandi untouch also most of the egg
meat and bread the last of cours sodden and worthless it did not
take long to draw the cork and then john fill a broken wineglass
there wa in the basket half full of water and half of brandi and made
jess drink it with the result that she began to look a littl less like
a corps next he repeat the process twice on hi own account and
instantli felt as though new life were flow into him then thei went
on cautious
the hors allow themselv to be caught without troubl and did not
appear to be ani the wors for the adventur although the flank of on
wa graze by a bullet
there is a tree yonder where the bank shelv over we had better
tie the hors up dress and eat some breakfast said john almost
cheerfulli and accordingli thei proceed toward it suddenli john
who wa ahead start back with an exclam of fear and the hors
began to snort for there stark and stiff in death alreadi swollen
and discolour by decompositiona is sometim the case with peopl
kill by lightningth rifl in their hand twist and fuse their
cloth cut and blown from their bandolierslai the two boer murder
it wa a terrifi sight and taken in conjunct with their own
remark escap on to make the most careless and sceptic reflect
and yet there ar peopl who sai that there is no god and no
punish for wicked said john aloud

end of decemb and with him went all the life and light of the place
dear me bessi said old sila croft on the even after he had

broke into a passion of hyster tear
what did you send him for she ask of her uncl it wa

bring her back the most that could happen wa that thei would be both
shut up togeth now he is deadi know that those boer have shot
himand it is all your fault and if he is dead i will never speak to
you again
the old man retreat somewhat dismai at thi outburst which wa not
at all in bessi style
ah well he said to himself that is the wai of women thei turn
into tiger about a man
there mai have been truth in thi reflect but a tiger is not a
pleasant domest pet as poor old sila discov dure the next two
month the more bessi thought about the matter the more incens she
grew becaus he had sent her lover awai inde in a littl while she
quit forgot that she had herself acquiesc in hi go in short her
temper gave wai complet under the strain so that at last her uncl
scarc dare to mention john name
meanwhil thing had been go as ill without as within first of
allthat wa the dai after john departuretwo or three loyal
boer and an english storekeep from lake chrissi in new scotland
outspan on the place and implor sila croft to fly for hi life
into natal while there wa yet time thei said that the boer would
certainli shoot ani englishman who might be suffici defenceless
but the old man would not listen
i am an englishmancivi romanu sum he said in hi sturdi
fashion and i do not believ that thei will touch me who have live
among them for twenti year at ani rate i am not go to run awai and
leav my place at the merci of a pack of thiev if thei shoot me thei
will have to reckon with england for the deed so i expect that thei
will leav me alon bessi can go if she like but i shall stop here
and see the row through and there an end of it
whereon bessi have flatli declin to budg an inch the loyalist
depart in a hurri metaphor wring their hand at such an
exhibit of illplac confid and insular pride thi littl scene
occur at dinnertim and after dinner old sila proceed to hurl
defianc at hi foe in anoth fashion go to a cupboard in hi
bedroom he extract an exceedingli larg union jack and promptli
advanc with it to an open spot between two of the orangetre in
front of the hous where in such a posit that it could be seen for
mile around a flagstaff wa plant form of a veri tall young blue
gum upon thi flagstaff it wa silass habit to hoist the larg union
jack on the queen birthdai christma dai and other state occas
now jantj he said when he had bent on the bunt run her up
and ill cheer and accordingli as the broad flag float out on the
breez he took off hi hat and wave it and gave such a hip hip
hoorah in hi stentorian tone that bessi ran out from the hous to
see what wa the matter nor wa he satisfi with thi but have
obtain a ladder he place it against the post and sent jantj up
it instruct him to fasten the rope on which the flag wa bent at a
height of about fifteen feet from the ground so that nobodi should get
at it to haul it down
there he said iv nail my colour to the mast that will show
these gentri that an englishman live here
confound their polit
frustrat their knavish trick
god save the queen
amen said bessi but she had her doubt about the wisdom of that
union jack which whenev the wind blew stream out a visibl
defianc not calcul to sooth the breast of excit patriot
inde two dai after that a patrol of three boer spy the ensign
whilst yet a long wai off gallop up in hot hast to see what it
meant sila saw them come and take hi rifl in hi hand went
and stood beneath the flag for which he had an almost superstiti
vener feel sure that thei would not dare to meddl either with
him or it

three men with all of whom he wa perfectli acquaint
it mean that an englishman live here jan wa the answer
haul the dirti rag down said the man
i will see you damn first repli old sila

ident we no longer resembl a solitari boulder on a plain but ar
as a work stone built into the great edific of civilis societi
the place of a man like frank muller is at the junction of the water
of civilis and barbar too civilis to possess those savag
virtu which such as thei ar repres the quantum of innat good
natur ha thought fit to allow in the mixtur man and too barbar
to be subject to the tender constraint of cultiv societi he is

unreason spiritu terror and unrestrain passion that have their

muller might have broken upon the world as a napoleon had he been a

stumblingblock of weak which if that path had been laid along
a littl higher or a littl lower level in the scale of circumst
would themselv have been deadli weapon of overmast forc
see him as with hi dark heart fill up with fear he thunder along
from that scene of midnight death and murder which hi brain had not
fear to plan and hi hand to execut onward hi black hors stride
companion by the storm like a dark thought travel on the wing of
night he doe not believ in ani god and yet the terribl fear that
spring up in hi soul born funguslik from a few drop of blood take
shape and form and seem to cry aloud we ar the messeng of the
aveng god he glanc up high on the black bosom of the storm the

the voic of the thunder read it aloud in spiritshak accent he
shut hi daze ey and even the fall rhythm of hi hors hoof
beat out there is a god there is a god from the silent earth on
which thei strike
and so on through the tempest and the night fly from that which no
man can leav behind
it wa near midnight when frank muller drew rein at a wretch and
lone mud hut built on the bank of the vaal and flank by an equal
miser shed the place wa silent as the grave not even a dog
bark
that beast of a kafir is not here he said aloud i will have him
flog to death hendrik hendrik
as he call a form rose up at hi veri feet caus the weari hors
to start back so violent that he almost threw hi rider to the ground
what in the name of the devil ar you almost shriek frank muller
whose nerv inde were in no condit to bear fresh shock
it is i baa said the form at the same time throw off a
grei blanket in which it wa envelop and reveal the villain
counten of the oneei witchdoctor who had taken the letter to
bessi for year thi man had been muller bodyserv who follow
him about like a shadow

ha gallop far and we start at dawn stop tell me where ar the
light and the brandi if you have drunk the brandi i will flog you
thei ar on the shelf to the left as you go in baa and there is

muller swung himself from the saddl and enter the hut push
open the cranki brokenhing door with a kick he found the box of
tandstickor match and after on or two attemptsdu chiefli to hi
shake handsucceed in strike fire and light a coars dip such
as the boer make out of mutton fat near the candl were a bottl of
peach brandi two third full a tin pannikin and a jug of river water
seiz the pannikin he half fill it with spirit ad a littl
water and drank off the mixtur then he took the meat and bread from
the same shelf and cut some of each with hi claspknif tri
to eat but he could not swallow much and soon gave up the attempt
consol himself instead with the brandi
bah he said the stuff tast like hell fire and he fill hi
pipe and sat smoke
present hendrik came in to sai that the hors wa eat well and
turn to go out again when hi master beckon him to stop the man
wa surpris for gener hi master wa not fond of hi societi
except when he want to consult him or persuad him to exercis hi
pretend art of divin the truth wa howev that at the moment
frank muller would have been glad to consort with a dog the event of
the night had brought thi terribl man steep in iniqu from hi
youth up down to the level of a child frighten at the dark for a
while he sat in silenc the kafir squat on the ground at hi feet
present howev the dose of power spirit took effect on him
and he began to talk more unguardedli than wa hi custom even with hi
black familiar hendrik
how long have you been here he ask of hi retain
about four dai baa

pole and he open hi mouth and on ey twist up hi hideou
counten into a ghastli imit of bessi sorrowstricken face
and grip the post that support the hut to give verisimilitud to
hi perform
so she believ it
sure
what did she do then
she set the dog on me look here and here and here and he point
to the halfheal scar left by stomp sharp fang
muller laugh a littl i should like to have seen him worri you you

so baa said the kafir rub hi hand in glee but will he be
found guilti
i dont know murmur the white man stroke hi golden beard that
will depend upon what missi ha to sai and upon the verdict of the
court he ad by wai of an afterthought
on the verdict of the court ha ha chuckl hi wick satellit
on the verdict of the court ye ye and the baa will be presid
ha ha on need no witchcraft to guess that verdict and if the court
find uncl sila guilti who will do the shoot baa
i have not thought of that the time ha not come to think of it it
doe not matter anybodi can carri out the sentenc of the law
baa said the kafir i have done much for you and had littl pai
i have done ugli thing i had read omen and made medicin and smelt
out your enemi will you grant me a favour will you let me shoot
oom croft if the court find him guilti it is not much to ask baa
i am a clever wizard and deserv my pai
why do you want to shoot him
becaus he flog me onc year ago for be a witchdoctor and
the other dai he hunt me off the place besid it is nice to shoot
a white man i should like it better he went on with a smack of the
lip if it were missi who set the dog on me i would
in a moment muller had seiz the astonish ruffian by the throat and
wa kick and shake him as though he were a toi hi brutal talk of
bessi appeal to such manli as he had in him and whatev hi
own wicked mai have been he wa too madli in love with the woman to
let her name be taken in vain by a man whom though he held hi magic
in superstiti rever he yet rank lower than a dog with hi
nerv strung to the highest possibl state of tension and half drunk
as he wa frank muller wa no more to be plai with or irrit than
is a mad bull
you black beast he yell if ever you dare to mention her name
again like that i will kill you for all your witchcraft and he hurl
him with such forc against the wall of the hut that the whole place
shook the man fell and lai for a moment groan then he crept from
the hut on hi hand and knee
muller sat scowl from under hi bent brow and watch him go when
he wa gone he rose and fasten the door behind him then suddenli he
burst into tear the result no doubt of the mingl effect of drink
mental and physic exhaust and the neverrest passionon can
scarc call it lovewhich at at hi heart like the worm that dieth
not
oh bessi bessi he groan i have done it all for you sure
you cannot be angri when i have kill them all for you oh my
darl my darl if you onli knew how i love you oh my darl
my darl and in an agoni of passion he flung himself on to the rough
pallet in the corner of the hut and sob himself to sleep
it would seem that frank muller evildo did not make him happi
the truth be that to enjoi wicked a man must be not onli without
conscienc but also without passion now frank muller wa torment
with a veri effect substitut for the firstsuperstit and by the
latter hi life wa overshadow sinc the beauti of a girl possess
the power to domin hi wildest mood and to inflict upon him torment
that she herself wa incap even of imagin
at the first light of dawn hendrik crept humbl into the hut to wake
hi master and within half an hour thei were across the vaal and on the
road to wakkerstroom
as the light increas so did muller spirit rise till at last when
the red sun came up in glori and swept awai the shadow he felt as
though all the load of guilt and fear that lai upon hi heart had
depart with them he could see now that the death of the two boer by
lightn wa a mere accidenta happi accid inde for had it not
so chanc he would have been forc to kill them himself if he could
not have obtain possess of the warrant by other mean as it wa
he had forgotten about thi document but it did not matter much he
reflect nobodi would be like to find the bodi of the two men and
hors under that lone bank certainli thei would not be found befor
the aasvogel had pick them clean and these would be at work upon
them now and if thei were found the paper would have rot or
been blown awai or at the worst render so discolour as to be
unread for the rest there wa noth to connect him with the
murder now that hi confeder were dead hendrik would prove an
alibi for him he wa a us man hendrik besid who would believ
that it wa a murder two men were escort an englishman to the river
thei becam involv in a quarrel the englishman shot them and thei
shot the englishman and hi companion then the hors plung into the
vaal upset the cart and there wa an end of it he could see
now how well thing had gone for him event had place him beyond
suspicion
then he fell to think of the fruit of hi honest labour and
muller cheek grew warm with the mount blood and hi ey flash
with the fire of youth in two daysfortyeight hoursat the outsid
bessi would be in hi arm he could not miscarri now for wa he not
in absolut command besid hendrik had read it in hi omen long
ago mooifontein should be storm on the morrow if that were
necessari and oom sila croft and bessi should be taken prison
and then he knew how to deal with them hi talk about shoot on the
previou night had been no idl threat she should yield herself to him
or the old man must die and then he would take her there could be no
legal consequ now that the british govern wa in the act of
surrend it would be a meritori deed to execut a rebel englishman
it is not a veri rare thing to meet white men in south
africa who believ more or less in the efficaci of nativ
witchcraft and although such a proceed is forbidden by
law who at a pinch will not hesit to consult the
witchdoctorsauthor
ye it wa all plain sail now how long had it need to win
herthre year he had love her for three year well he would have
hi reward and then hi passion satisfi he would turn hi mind to
those farreach ambiti scheme whereof the end wa someth
like a throne
chapter xxvii
sila is convinc
at first bessi wa utterli prostrat by the blow that had fallen on
her but as time went on she reviv a littl for her wa an elast
and a sanguin natur troubl sink into the soul of some like water
into a spong and weight them down almost to the grave from other
thei run off as the water doe if pour upon marbl mere wet the
surfac
bessi belong to neither of these class but wa of a substanc
between the twoa healthi happyheart woman full of beauti and
vigour made to bloom in the sunshin not to languish in the shadow
of some old grief women of her stamp do not die of broken heart or
condemn themselv to lifelong celibaci as a sacrific to the shade of
the depart if unfortun no 1 is remov as a gener rule thei
shed mani a tear and suffer mani a pang and after a decent interv
veri sensibl turn their attent to no 2
still it wa but a palefac quiet bessi who went to and fro about
the place after the visit of the oneei kafir all her irrit
had left her now she no longer reproach her uncl becaus he had
despatch john to pretoria inde on that veri even after the evil
tide came he began to blame himself bitterli in her presenc for
have sent her lover awai when she stop him
it is god will uncl she said quietli you onli did what it wa
ordain that you should do then she came and laid her sunni head upon
the old man shoulder and cri a littl and said that thei two were
all alon in the world now and he comfort her in the best fashion
that he could it wa a curiou thing that thei neither of them thought
much of jess when thei talk thu of be alon jess wa an enigma a
thing apart even from them when she wa there she wa love and allow
to go her own wai when she wa not there she seem to fade into outer
dark a veil came down between her and her belong of cours
thei were both veri fond of her but simplenatur peopl ar apt to
shrink from what thei cannot understand and these two were no except
to the rule for instanc bessi affect for her sister wa a poor
thing compar to the deep and selfsacrif though often secret
love that her sister shower upon her she love her old uncl far more
dearli than she love jess and it must be own that he return her
attach with interest and in those dai of heavi troubl thei drew
nearer to each other than ever thei were befor
but as time went on thei began to hope again no confirm of john
death reach them wa it not possibl then after all that the stori
wa an invent thei knew that frank muller wa not a man to hesit
at a lie if he had a purpos to gain and thei could guess in thi case
what that purpos wa hi furiou passion for bessi wa no secret from
either of them and it occur to them as possibl that the tale of
john death might have been invent to forward it thi wa scarc
probabl it is true but it might be so and howev cruel suspens
mai be it is at least less absolut crush than the dead weight of
certainti
on sundayit wa just a week sinc the letter camebessi wa sit
after dinner on the verandah when her quick ear caught what she took
to be the boom of heavi gun far awai on the drakensberg she rose
and leav the hous climb the hill behind it on reach it top
she stood and look at the great solemn stretch of mountain awai a
littl to her right wa a squar precipit peak call majuba which
wa gener cloth in cloud todai howev there wa no mist and
it seem to her that it wa from the direct of thi peak that the
faint roll sound came float on the breez but she could see
noth the mountain seem as tenantless and devoid of life as on the
dai when it first tower up upon the face of thing creat present
the sound di awai and she return think that she must have been
deceiv by the echo of some distant thunderstorm
next dai thei learnt from the nativ that what she had heard wa the
roar of the big gun cover the flight of the british troop down
the precipit side of majuba mountain after these tide old
sila croft began to lose heart a littl the run of disast wa
so unreliev that even hi robust faith in the invinc of the
english arm wa shaken
it is veri strang bessi he said veri strang but never mind
it is bound to come right at last our govern is not go to knock
under becaus it ha suffer a few revers
then follow a long four week of uncertainti the air wa thick with
rumour most of them brought by nativ and on or two by pass
boer to which sila croft declin to pai ani attent soon
howev it becam abundantli clear that an armistic wa conclud
between the english and the boer but what were it term or it object
thei were quit unabl to decid sila croft thought that the boer
overaw by the advanc of an overwhelm forc meant to give in
without further fight but bessi shook her head
thi is said on good author to have been their
intent had not mr gladston surpris them by hi sudden
surrenderauthor
on dayit wa the same on which john and jess left pretoriaa kafir
brought the new that the armistic wa at an end that the english were
advanc up to the nek in thousand and were go to forc it on the
morrow and reliev the garrisonsa piec of intellig that brought
some of the old light back to bessi ey as for her uncl he wa

bessi is put to the question
meanwhil anoth littl tragedi wa be enact at the back of the
hous after the oneei witchdoctor hendrik had knock sila croft
down and assist in the pleas oper of drag him to the
flagstaff it occur to hi villain heart that the present would be
a good opportun to profit person by the confus and possibl
add to the englishman misfortun by do him some injuri on hi
own account accordingli just befor frank muller began to read the
despatch announc the british surrend he slip awai into the
hous which wa now total desert to see what he could steal
pass into the sittingroom he annex bessi gold watch and chain
which wa ly on the mantelpiec a present that her uncl had made

proceed to the kitchen where ly on the dresser readi to put awai
there wa a goodli store of silver fork and spoon which bessi had
been busili engag in clean that morn these he also transfer
to the extent of sever dozen to the capaci pocket of the

but he still held hi assegai in hi hand and go out of the kitchen
door with it he show himself within a few feet of the kennel the dog
recognis him instantli and went nearli mad with furi make the most
desper effort to break it chain and get at him for some moment
he stood excit the anim by deris gestur and pelt it with
stone till at last fear that the clamour would attract attent
he suddenli transfix it with hi spear and then think he wa
quit unobserv sat down snuf and enjoi the luxuri of watch

but as it happen he wa not quit alon for creep along in the
grass and rubbish that grew on the farther side of the wall hi brown
bodi squeez tightli against the brown stonesso tightli that an
unpractis ey would certainli have fail to notic it at a distanc
of a dozen paceswa the hottentot jantj occasion too he would
lift hi head abov the level of the wall and observ the proceed
of the oneei man appar he wa undecid what to do for he
hesit a littl and whilst he did so hendrik kill the dog
now jantj had all a hottentot natur love for anim which is
gener speak as mark as is the kafir callous toward
them and he wa particularli fond of the dog stomp which alwai went
out with him those rare occas when he thought it safe or desir
to walk like an ordinari man instead of wriggl from bush to bush like
a panther or wriggl through the grass like a snake the sight of
the anim death therefor rais in hi yellow breast a veri keen
desir for vengeanc on the murder if vengeanc could be safe
accomplish and he paus to reflect how thi might be done as he
thought hendrik rose gave the dead dog a kick withdrew hi assegai
from the carcas and then as though struck by a sudden desir to
conceal the murder he undid the collar and lift the dog in hi
arm carri him with difficulti into the hous and laid him under the
kitchent thi done he came out again to the wall which wa built
of unmortar stone pull on out without troubl deposit the
watch and the silver he had stolen in the caviti and replac the
stone next befor jantj could guess what he meant to do he proceed
to make it practic imposs for hi robberi to be discov
or at ani rate veri improb by light a match and have first
glanc round to see that nobodi wa look reach up and appli
it to the thick thatch wherewith the hous itself wa roof the fring
of which just at thi spot wa not more than nine feet from the ground
no rain had fallen at mooifontein for sever dai and there had been
a hot sun with wind as a result the thatch wa dry as tinder the light
caught in a second and in two more a thin line of fire wa run up
the roof
hendrik paus step a few pace back rest hi shoulder against
the wall immedi the other side of which wa jantj and began
to chuckl aloud and rub hi hand as he admir the result of
hi labour thi prove too much for the hottentot behind him the
provoc wa overmast and so wa the opportun jantj
carri with him the thick stick on which he wa so fond of cut
notch rais it in both hand be brought the heavi knob down with
all hi strength upon the oneei villain unprotect skull it wa
a thick skull but the knob prevail against it and fractur it and
down went the estim witchdoctor as though he were dead
next take a leaf out of hi fallen enemi book jantj slip over
the wall and seiz the senseless man he drag him by on arm into
the kitchen and roll him under the tabl to keep compani with the
dead dog then fill with a fear joi he crawl out to a point of
vantag in a littl plantat seventi or eighti yard to the right of
the hous whenc he could see what the boer were do and watch the
conflagr that he knew must ensu for the fire had taken instant
and irremedi hold
ten minut or so afterward that amiabl charact hendrik partial
regain hi sens to find himself surround by a sea of fire in
which he perish miser not have power to move and hi feebl
cri be total swallow up and lost in the fierc roar of the
flame such wa the veri appropri end of hendrik and of the magic of
hendrik
down by the flagstaff the old man lai in hi fit while bessi tend
him and a poss of boer stood round smoke and laugh or loung
about with an air of lordli superior well worthi of victor in
possess
will none of you help me to take him to the hous she cri sure

tearstain face with a fierc smile plai round the corner of hi
cleancut mouth which hi beard wa trim to show
it will pass miss bessi he said it will pass i have often seen
such fit thei come from too much excit or too much drink
suddenli he broke off with an exclam and point to the hous
from the roof of which pale curl of blue smoke were rise
who ha fire the hous he shout by heaven i will shoot the
man
the boer wheel round stare in astonish and as thei gaze the
tinderlik roof burst into a red sheet of flame that grew and gather
breadth and height with an almost marvel rapid just then too

the two men advanc and seiz bessi by both arm then faint and
overpow she wa led through the littl plantat over a gap in
the garden wall down past the scorch syringatre which line the
roadwai that ran along the hillsid at the back of the still burn
hous till thei reach the waggonhous with the two littl room
which serv respect as a store and a har room there she wa
thrust into the storeroom which wa half full of loos potato and
meali in sack and the door lock upon her
there wa no window to thi room and the onli light in it wa such
as found it wai through the chink of the door and an airhol in the
masonri of the back wall bessi sank on a halfempti sack of meali
and tri to reflect her first thought wa of escap but soon she came
to the conclus that thi wa a practic imposs the stout
yellow wood door wa lock upon her and a sentri stood befor it she
rose and look through the airhol in the rear wall but there anoth
sentri wa post then she turn her attent to the side wall that
divid the room from the waggonhous it wa built of fourteeninch
green brickwork and had crack from the shrinkag of the brick so
that she could hear everyth that went on in the waggonhous and
even see anybodi who might be move about in it but it wa far too
strong for her to hope to be abl to break through and even if she did
it would be useless for arm men were there also besid how could
she run awai and leav her old uncl to hi fate
chapter xxix
condemn to death
half an hour pass in silenc which wa broken onli by the footstep
of the sentri as thei tramp or rather loiter up and down or
by the occasion fall of some calcin masonri from the wall of the
burntout hous what between the smell of smoke and dust the heat of
the sun on the tin roof abov and the redhot ember of the hous in
front the littl room where bessi wa shut up grew almost unbear
and she felt as though she should faint upon the sack through on of
the crack in the waggonhous wall there blew a slight draught and by
thi crack bessi place herself lean her head against the wall
so as to get the full benefit of the air and to command a view of the
place present sever of the boer came into the waggonhous and
pull some of the cart and timber out of it leav on buckwaggon
howev place along the wall on the side opposit to the crack through
which bessi wa look then thei pull the scotch cart over to her
side laugh about someth among themselv as thei did so and
arrang it with it back turn toward the waggon support the
shaft upon a waggonjack next out of the farther corner of the place
thei extract an old sawbench and set it at the top of the open
space then bessi understood what thei were do thei were arrang
a court and the sawbench wa the judg chair so frank muller meant
to carri out hi threat
shortli after thi all the boer except those who were keep guard
file into the place and began to clamber on to the buckwaggon seat
themselv with much rough joke in a doubl row upon the broad
side rail next appear han coetze hi head bound up in a bloodi
handkerchief he wa pale and shaki but bessi could see that he wa
but littl the wors for hi wound then came frank muller himself
look white and veri terribl and as he came the men stop their
joke and talk inde it wa curiou to observ how strong wa hi
ascend over them as a rule the weak part of boer organis is
that it is practic imposs to persuad on boer to pai defer
to or obei anoth but thi wa certainli not the case where frank
muller wa concern
muller advanc without hesit to the sawbench at the top of the
open space and sat down on it place hi rifl between hi knee
after thi there wa a paus and then bessi saw her old uncl led
forward by two arm boer who halt in the middl of the space about
three pace from the sawbench and stood on on either side of their
prison at the same time han coetze climb into the scotch cart
and muller drew a notebook and a pencil from hi pocket
silenc he said we ar assembl here to try the englishman sila
croft by courtmarti the charg against him ar that by word and
deed notabl by continu to fly the british flag after the countri
had been surrend to the republ he ha traitor rebel
against the govern of thi countri further that he ha attempt
to murder a burgher of the republ by shoot at him with a load
rifl if these charg ar prove against him he will be liabl to
death by martial law prison croft what do you answer to the charg
against you
the old man who seem veri quiet and compos look up at hi judg
and then repli
i am an english subject i onli defend my hous after you had
murder on of my servant i deni your jurisdict over me and i
refus to plead
frank muller made some note in hi pocketbook and then said i
overrul the prison object as to the jurisdict of the court
as to the charg we will now take evid of the first charg no
evid is need for we all saw the flag fly as to the second
han coetze the assault burgher will now give evid han
coetze do you swear in the name of god and the republ to speak the
truth the whole truth and noth but the truth
almighti ye answer han from the cart on which he had enthron
himself so help me the dear lord
proce then
i wa enter the hous of the prison to arrest him in obedi
to your worship command when the prison lift a gun and fire
at me the bullet from the gun struck me upon the ear cut it and
put me to much pain and loss of blood that is the evid i have
to give
that right that is not a lie said some of the men on the waggon
prison have you ani question to ask the wit said muller
i have no question to ask i deni your jurisdict said the old man
with spirit
the prison declin to question the wit and again plead to the
jurisdict a plea which i have overrul gentlemen do you desir to
hear ani further evid
no no
do you find the prison guilti of the charg laid against him
ye ye from the waggon
muller made a further note in hi book and went on
then the prison have been found guilti of high treason and
attempt murder the onli matter that remain is the question of
the punish requir to be mete out by the law to such wick
and horribl offenc everi man will give hi verdict have duli
consid if there is ani wai by which in accord with the holi
dictat of hi conscienc and with the natur prompt to piti
in hi heart he can extend merci to the prison as command and
presid of the court the first vote li with me and i must tell
you gentlemen that i feel the respons a veri heavi on in
the sight of god and my countri and i must also warn you not to be
influenc or overrul by my decis who am like you onli a man
liabl to err and be led awai
hear hear said the voic on the waggon as he paus to note the
effect of hi address
gentlemen and burgher of the state my natur prompt in thi case
ar toward piti the prison is an old man who ha live mani year
amongst us like a brother inde he is a voortrekk and though an
englishman on of the father of the land can we condemn such a on to
a bloodi grave more especi as he ha a niec depend on him
no no thei cri in answer to thi skil touch upon the better
string in their natur
gentlemen those sentiment do you honour my own heart cri but now
no no whatev hi sin have been let the old man go free but
then came reflect true the prison is old but should not ag have
taught him wisdom is that which is not to be forgiven to youth to be
forgiven to the ripe experi of mani year mai a man murder and be a
traitor becaus he is old
no certainli not answer the choru on the waggon
then there is the second point he wa a voortrekk and a father to
the land should he not therefor have known better than to betrai it
into the hand of the cruel godless english for gentlemen though
that charg is not laid against him we must rememb as throw light
upon hi gener charact that the prison wa on of those vile men
who betrai the land to shepston is it not a most cruel and unnatur
thing that a father should sell hi own children into slaverythat
a father of the land should barter awai it freedom therefor on thi
point too doe justic temper merci
that is so echo the choru with particular enthusiasm most of them
have themselv been instrument in bring the annex about
then on more thing thi man ha a niec and it is the care of
all good men to see that the young shall not be left destitut and
friendless lest thei should grow up bad and becom enemi to the
wellb of the state but in thi case that will not be so for the
farm will go to the girl by law and inde she will be well rid of so
desper and godless an old man
and now have set my reason toward on side and the other befor
you and have warn you fulli to act each man accord to hi
conscienc i give my vote it isand in the midst of the most intens
silenc he paus and look at old sila who never even quailedit
is death
there wa a littl hum of convers and poor bessi survei the
scene through the crack in the storeroom wall groan in bitter
and despair of heart
then han coetze spoke it cut hi bosom in two he said to have to
sai a word against on to whom he had for mani year been as a brother
but then what wa he to do the man had plot evil against their
land the dear land that the dear lord had given them and which thei
and their father had on variou occas water and were still
continu to water with their blood what could be a fit
punish for so blackheart a traitor and how would it be possibl
to insur the better behaviour of other damn englishmen unless thei
inflict that punish there could ala be but on answerthough
person speak he utter it with mani tearsand that answer wa
death
after thi there were no more speech but each man vote accord to
hi ag upon hi name be call by the presid at first there
wa a littl hesit for some among them were fond of old sila
and loth to destroi him but frank muller had plai hi game veri well
and notwithstand hi appeal to their independ of judgment thei
knew full sure what would happen to him who gave hi vote against the
presid so thei swallow their better feel with all the eas for
which such swallow is note and on by on utter the fatal word
when thei had all done frank muller address sila
prison you have heard the judgment against you i need not now
recapitul your crime you have had a fair and open trial by
courtmarti such as our law direct have you anyth to sai why
sentenc of death should not be pass upon you in accord with the
judgment
old sila look up with flash ey and shook back hi fring of
white hair like a lion at bai
i have noth to sai if you will do murder do it blackheart
villain that you ar i might point to my grei hair to my murder
servant to my home that took me ten year to builddestroi by you
i might tell you how i have been a good citizen and live peaceabl
and neighbourli in the land for more than twenti yearsai and done
kind after kind to mani of you who ar go to butcher me in
cold blood but i will not shoot me if you will and mai my death lie
heavi on your head thi morn i would have said that my countri
would aveng me i cannot sai that now for england ha desert us and
i have no countri therefor i leav the vengeanc in the hand of god
who never fail to aveng though sometim he wait for long to do
it i am not afraid of you shoot menow if you like i have lost my
honour my home and my countri why should i not lose my life also
frank muller fix hi cold ey upon the old man quiver face and
smile a dread smile of triumph
prison it is now my duti in the name of god and the republ to
sentenc you to be shot tomorrow at dawn and mai the almighti forgiv
you your wicked and have merci upon your soul
let the prison be remov and let a man ride full speed to the empti
hous on the hillsid where the englishman with the red beard us to
live on hour thi side of wakkerstroom and bring back with him the
clergyman he will find wait there that the prison mai be offer
hi ministr also let two men be set to dig the prison grave
in the burialplac at the back of the hous
the guard laid their hand upon the old man shoulder and he turn
and went with them without a word through her crack in the wall bessi
watch him go till the dear old head with it fring of white hair
and the bent frame were no more visibl then at last benumb and
exhaust by the horror she wa pass through her faculti fail
her and she fell forward in a faint there upon the sack
meanwhil muller wa write the deathwarr on a sheet of hi
pocketbook at the foot he left a space for hi own signatur but for
reason of hi own he did not sign what he did do wa to pass the book
round to be countersign by all who had form the court in thi mock
trial hi object be to implic everi on there present in the
judici murder by the direct and incontrovert evid of hi
signmanu now boer ar simpl pastor folk but thei ar not quit
so simpl as to be deceiv by a move like thi and hereon follow a
veri instruct littl scene to a man thei had been will enough to
give their verdict for the execut of sila but thei were by no mean
prepar to record it in black and white as soon as thei understood
the object of their fear and respect command a gener desir
manifest itself to make themselv individu and collect
scarc suddenli thei found that thei had busi outsid to which
each and all of them must attend alreadi thei had escap from their
extemporis jurybox and head by the redoubt han were
approach the entranc to the waggonhous when frank muller
perceiv their design and roar in a voic of thunder
stop not a man leav thi place till the warrant is sign
instantli thei halt and began to look innoc and convers
han coetze come here and sign said muller again whereon that
unfortun advanc with as good a grace as he could muster murmur
to himself curs not loud but deep upon the head of that devil of a
man frank muller
howev there wa no help for it so with a sickli smile he put hi
name to the fatal document in big and shaki letter then muller
call anoth man who instantli tri to shirk on the ground that hi
educ had been neglect and that he could not write an excus
which avail him littl for frank muller quietli wrote hi name for
him leav a space for hi mark after thi there wa no more troubl
and in five minut the back of the warrant wa cover with the
sprawl signatur of the variou member of the court
on by on the men went till at last muller wa left alon seat on
the sawbench hi head sunk upon hi breast in on hand hold the
warrant while with the other he stroke hi golden beard present he
ceas stroke hi beard and sat for some minut perfectli stillso
still that he might have been carv in stone by thi time the

chapter xxx
we must part john
jess and her companion stood in aw silenc and gaze at the blacken
and distort corps of the thunderblast boer then thei pass by
them to the tree which grew some ten pace or more on the other side of
the place of death there wa some difficulti in lead the hors by
the bodi but at last thei came with a wheel and a snort of suspicion
and were ti up to the tree by john meanwhil jess took some of the
hardboil egg out of the basket and vanish remark that she
should take her cloth off and dry them in the sun while she at her
breakfast and that she advis him to do likewis accordingli so soon
as she wa well out of sight behind the shelter of the rock she set
to work to free herself from her sodden garment a task of no littl
difficulti then she wrung them out and spread them on by on on the
flat waterwash stone around which were by now thoroughli warm
with the sun next she climb to a pool under the shadow of the steep
bank in the rockb of the river where she bath her bruis and
wash the sand and mud from her hair and feet her bath finish she
return and sat herself on a slab of flat stone out of the glare of the
sun and at her breakfast of hardboil egg reflect meanwhil
on the posit in which she found herself her heart wa veri sore and
heavi and almost could she wish that she were ly deep beneath those
rush water she had count upon death and now she wa not dead
inde she with her shame and troubl might yet live for mani a year
she wa as on who in her sleep had seem to soar on angel wing far
into the airi depth and then awaken with a start to find that
she had tumbl from her bed all the heroic scale all the more than
earthli depth of passion all the spiritualis desir that sprang into
be beneath the shadow of the approach end had come down to the
common level of an undesir attach along which she must drag
her weari feet for mani a year nor wa thi all she had been fals to
bessi more she had broken bessi lover troth she had tempt
him and he had fallen and now he wa as bad as she death would have
justifi all thi never would she have done it had she thought that
she wa doom to live but now death had cheat her as is hi fashion
with peopl to whom hi presenc is more or less desir leav her
to cope with the spirit she had invok when hi sword wa quiver
over her
what would be the end of it in the event of their escap what could be
the end except miseri it should go no farther far as it had gonethat
she swore no not if it broke her heart and hi too the condit
were alter again and the memori of those dread and wondrou hour
when thei two swung upon the rage river and exchang their undi
troth with the grave for an altar must remain a memori and noth
more it had risen in their live like some beauti yet terribl
dreamimag of celesti joi and now like a dream it must vanish and
yet it wa no dream except in so far as all her life wa a dream and
a vision a riddl of which glimps of the answer came as rare as
gleam of sunshin on a raini dai ala it wa no dream it wa a
portion of the live breath past that have onc been is
immort in it everi part and moment incarn as it doe the veri
spirit of immort an utter incapac to chang as the act wa
as the word had been spoken so would act and word be for ever and for
ever and now thi undi thing must be cage and cast about with
the semblanc of death and cloud over with the shadow of an unreal
forget oh it wa bitter veri bitter what would it be now to
go awai quit awai from him and know him marri to her own sister
the other woman with a prior right what would it be to think of
bessi sweet slowli creep into her empti place and fill it
of bessi gentl constant love cover up the recollect of their
wilder passion pervad it and cover it up as the twilight slowli
pervad and cover up the dai till at last perhap it wa blot out
and forgotten in the night of forget
and yet it must be so she wa determin that it should be so ah that
she had di then with hi kiss upon her lip why had he not let her
die and griev thu the poor girl shook her damp hair over her face
and sob in the bitter of her heart as ev might have sob when
adam reproach her
but nake or dress sob will not mend matter in thi sad world
of our a fact which jess had the sens to recognis so present she
wipe her ey with her hair have noth els at hand to wipe them
with and set to work to struggl into her partial dri garment
again a process calcul to irrit the most fortun and
happymind woman in the whole wide world certainli in her present
frame of mind those damp bullettorn cloth drove jess frantic
so much so that had she been a man she would probabl have sworna
consol that her sex deni her fortun she carri a
travel comb in her pocket with which she made shift to do her
curl hair if hair can be said to be done when on ha not a hairpin
or even a bit of string wherewith to fasten it
then after a last and fright encount with her sodden boot that
seem to take almost as much out of her as her roll at the bottom of
the vaal jess rose and walk back to the spot where she had left john
an hour befor when she reach him he wa emploi in saddl up
the two grei with the saddl and bridl that he had remov from the
carcas of the hors which the lightn had destroi
why jess you look quit smart have you dri your cloth he said
i have after a fashion
ye she answer
he look at her dearest you have been cry come thing ar black
enough but it is useless to cry at ani rate we have escap with our
live so far
john said jess sharpli there must be no more of that thing
have chang we were dead last night now we have come to life again
besid she ad with a ghost of a laugh perhap you will see
bessi tomorrow i should think that we ought to have come to the end
of our misfortun
john face fell as a sens of the imposs and most tragic posit
in which thei were place physic and moral swept into hi mind
jess my own jess he said what can we do
she stamp her foot in the bitter anguish of her heart i told you
she said that there must be no more of that what ar you think
about from todai we ar dead to each other i have done with you
and you with me it is your own fault you should have let me die oh
john she wail out why did you not let me die why did we not both
die we should have been happi now orasleep we must part john we
must part and what shall i do without you how shall i live without
you
her distress wa veri poignant and it affect him so much that for a
moment he could not trust himself to answer her
would it not be best to make a clean breast of it to bessi he said
at last i should feel a villain for the rest of my life but upon my
word i have a mind to do it
no no she cri passion i will not allow it you shall swear
to me that you will never breath a word to bessi i will not have her
happi destroi we have sin we must suffer not bessi who is
innoc and onli take her right i promis my dear mother to look
after bessi and protect her and i will not be the on to betrai
hernev never you must marri her and i must go awai there is no
other wai out of it
john look at her not know what to sai or do a sharp pang of
despair went through him as he watch the passion pale face and the
great ey dim with tear how wa he to part from her he put out hi
arm to take her in them but she push him awai almost fierc
have you no honour she cri is it not all hard enough to bear
without your tempt me i tell you it is done with finish saddl
that hors and let us start the sooner we get off the sooner it will
be over unless the boer catch us again and shoot us which for my own
part i devoutli hope thei mai you must make up your mind to rememb
that i am noth but your sisterinlaw if you will not rememb
it then i shall ride awai and leav you to go your road and i will go
mine
john said no more her determin wa as crush as the cruel
necess that dictat it what wa more hi own reason and sens of
honour approv it whatev hi passion might prompt to the contrari
as he turn wearili to finish saddl the hors with jess he almost
regret that thei had not both been drown
of cours the onli saddl that thei had were those belong to the
dead boer which wa veri awkward for a ladi luckili for herself
howev from constant practic jess could ride almost as well as
though she had been train to the ring and wa even capabl of
balanc herself without a pommel on a man saddl have often and
often ridden round the farm in that fashion so soon as the hors were
readi she astonish john by clamber into the saddl of the older and
steadier anim place her foot in the stirrupstrap and announc
that she wa readi to start
you had better ride some other wai said john it isnt usual i
know but you will tumbl off so
you shall see she said with a cold littl laugh put the hors
into a canter as she spoke john follow her on the other hors
and notic with amaz that she sat as straight and steadi on her
slipperi seat as though she were on a hunt saddl keep herself
from fall by an instinct balanc of the bodi which wa veri
curiou to notic when thei were well on to the plain thei halt to
consid their rout and turn jess point to the long line of
vultur descend to feast on their wouldb murder if thei went
down the river it would lead them to standerton and there thei would be
safe if thei could slip into the town which wa garrison by english
but then as thei had gather from the convers of their escort
standerton wa close invest by the boer and to try and pass
through their line wa more than thei dare to do it wa true that
thei still had the pass sign by the boer gener but after what had
occur not unnatur thei were somewhat sceptic about the valu of
a pass and certainli most unwil to put it efficaci to the proof
so after due consider thei determin to avoid standerton and ride
in the opposit direct till thei found a practic ford of the
vaal fortun thei both of them had a veri good idea of the lai
of the land and in addit to thi john possess a small compass
fasten to hi watchchain which would enabl him to steer a fairli
correct cours across a veldta fact that render them independ of
the waggon track on the road thei were expos to the risk if not
the certainti of detect but on the wide veldt the chanc were
thei would meet no live creatur except the wild game should thei see
hous thei could avoid them and probabl their male inhabit would
be far awai from home on busi connect with the war
accordingli thei rode ten mile or more along the bank without see a
soul till thei reach a space of bubbl shallow water that look
fordabl inde an investig of the bank reveal the fact that a
load waggon had pass the river here and at no distant date perhap
a week befor
thi is good enough said john we will try it and without further
ado thei plung into the rapid
in the centr of the stream the water wa strong and deep and for a few
yard swept the hors off their leg but thei struck out boldli
till thei found their foot again and after that there wa no more
troubl on the farther side of the river john took counsel with hi
compass and thei steer a cours straight for mooifontein at middai
thei offsaddl the hors for an hour by some water and at a small
portion of their remain food then thei upsaddl and went on across
the lone desol veldt no human be did thei see all that long
dai the wide countri wa tenant onli by great herd of game that went
thunder past like squadron of cavalri or here and there by coteri
of vultur hiss and fight furious over some dead buck and so
at last the twilight gather and found them alon in the wilder
well what is to be done now said john pull up hi tire hors
it will be dark in half an hour
jess slid from her saddl as she answer get off and go to sleep i
suppos
she wa quit right there wa absolut noth els that thei could
do so john set to work and hobbl the hors ty them togeth
for further secur for it would be a dread thing if thei were to
strai by the time that thi wa done the twilight wa deepen into
night and the two sat down to contempl their surround with
feel akin to despair so far as the ey could reach there wa
noth to be seen but a vast stretch of lone plain across which the
night wind blew in dreari gust caus the green grass to rippl like
the sea there wa absolut no shelter to be had nor ani object to
break the monotoni of the veldt except two antheap set about five
pace apart john sat down on on of the antheap and jess took up
her posit on the other and there thei remain like pelican in the
wilder watch the daylight fade out of the dai
dont you think that we had better sit togeth suggest john
feebli it would be warmer you see
no i dont answer jess snappishli i am veri comfort as i
am
unfortun howev thi wa not the exact truth for alreadi poor
jesss teeth were chatter with cold soon inde weari as thei
were thei found that the onli wai to keep their blood move wa
to tramp continu up and down after an hour and a half of thi
exercis the breez drop and the temperatur becam more suitabl to
their lightli clad halfstarv and almost exhaust bodi then the
moon came up and the hyena or wolv or some such anim came up
also and howl round themthough thei could not see them these hyena
prove more than jesss nerv would bear and at last she condescend
to ask john to share her antheap where thei sat shiver in each
other arm throughout the livelong night inde had it not been for
the warmth thei gather from each other it is probabl that thei might
have fare even wors than thei did for though the dai were hot the
night were now begin to be cold on the high veldt especi when
as at present the air had recent been chill by the passag of a
heavi tempest anoth drawback to their romant situat wa that
thei were posit soak with the fall dew there thei sat or
rather cower for hour after hour without sleep for sleep wa
imposs and almost without speak and yet notwithstand the
wretched of their circumst not altogeth unhappi sinc thei
were unit in their miseri at last the eastern sky began to turn grei
and john rose shook the dew from hi hat and cloth and limp off
as well as hi halffrozen limb would allow to catch the hors which
were stand togeth some yard awai look huge and ghostlik in
the mist by sunris he had manag to saddl them up and thei start
onc more thi time howev he wa oblig to lift jess on to the
saddl
about eight oclock thei halt and at their littl remain food and
then went on slowli enough for the hors were almost as tire as
thei were and it wa necessari to husband them if thei were to reach
mooifontein by dark at middai thei rest for an hour and a half and
then feel almost worn out continu their journei reckon that
thei could not be more than sixteen or seventeen mile from mooifontein
it wa about two hour after thi that the catastroph happen the
cours thei were follow ran down the side of on land wave then
across a littl swampi sluit and up the opposit slope thei cross
the marshi ground walk their hors up to the crest of the opposit
rise and found themselv face to face with a parti of arm and
mount boer
chapter xxxi
jess find a friend
the boer swoop down on them with a shout like hawk on a sparrow
john pull up hi hors and drew hi revolv

cold tone it should have been countersign by the local command i

shoot us and have done with it
come cheer up jess he answer perhap the luck is go to
chang
she shook her head with the air of on who expect the worst and then
some gai young spirit among the boer came up and made thing pleasant
by an exhibit of their polish wit which thei chiefli exercis at
the expens of poor jess whose appear as mai well be imagin wa
exceedingli wretch and forlorn so much so that it would have move
the piti of most peopl but these specimen of the golden youth of
a simpl pastor folk found in it a rich mine of opportun thei
ask her if she would not like to ride straddleleg and if she had
bought her dress from an old hottentot who had done with it and if she
had been roll about tipsi in the veldt to get all the mud on it and
gener avail themselv of thi unparallel occas to be witti
at the expens of an english ladi in sore distress inde on gai
young dog call jacobu wa proceed from joke linguist to joke
practic perceiv that jess onli kept her seat on the man saddl
by the exercis of a faculti of balanc it occur to him that it
would be a fine thing to upset it and make her fall upon her face
accordingli with a sudden twist of the rein he brought hi hors
sharpli against her weari anim nearli throw it down but she wa
too quick for him and save herself by catch at the mane jess said
noth inde she made no answer to her tormentor and fortun
john understood littl of what thei were sai present howev
the young boer made anoth attempt put out hi hand to give her
a slight push as it happen john saw thi and the sight of the
indign caus the blood to boil in hi vein befor he could reflect
on what he wa do he wa alongsid of the man and catch him by
the throat had hurl him backward over hi crupper with all the forc
he could command jacobu fell heavili upon hi shoulder and instantli
there wa a great hubbub john drew hi revolv and the other boer
rais their rifl so that jess thought there wa an end of it and
put her hand befor her face have first thank john for aveng the
insult with a swift flash of her beauti ey and inde in anoth
second it would have been all over had not the elder man who inspect
the pass interpos in fact he had wit the proceed which led
to hi follow discomfitur and be a decent person at bottom
strongli disapprov of them
leav them alon and put down those gun he shout it serv
jacobu right he wa try to push the girl from her hors almighti
it is not wonder those english call us brute beast when you boi do
such thing put down your gun i sai and on of you help jacobu up

accordingli the row pass over and the play jacobuswhom jess
note with satisfact seem exceedingli ill and trembl in everi
limbwa with difficulti hoist on to hi hors to continu hi
journei with not a singl bit of fun left in him
a littl while after thi jess point out a long low hill that lai upon
the flat veldt a dozen mile or so awai like a stone upon a stretch of
sand
look she said there is mooifontein at last
we ar not there yet remark john sadli
anoth weari halfhour pass and then on pass over a crest
suddenli thei saw han coetze homestead ly down by the water in
the hollow so that wa whither thei were be taken
within a hundr yard of the hous the boer halt and consult
except jacobu who went on still look veri green final the elder

some help from the farm at ani rate you must go
now englishman said the boer
goodby jess said john god bless you
goodby john she answer look him steadili in the ey for a
moment and then turn awai to hide the tear which would gather in
her own
and thu thei part
she knew her wai now even across the open veldt for she dare not go
by the road there wa howev a bridl path that ran over the hill at
the back of mooifontein and for thi she shape her cours it wa five
oclock by now and both she and her hors were in a condit of great
exhaust enhanc in her own case by want of food and troubl of
mind but she wa a strong woman with a will like iron and she held
on when most girl would have di jess meant to get to mooifontein
somehow and she knew that she would get there if onli she could reach
the place and find help to send to her lover she did not greatli care
what happen to her afterward the pace of the hors she wa ride
grew slower and slower from the ambl canter into which at first she
manag occasion to forc it and which is the best pace to travel
at in south africa it relaps continu into a rough short trot
which wa agoni to her ride as she wa and from the trot into a
walk inde just befor sunset or a littl after six oclock the
walk becam final at last thei reach the rise ground that stretch
up the slope of the mooifontein hill and here the poor beast fell down
utterli worn out jess slip off and tri to drag it up but fail
it had no strength left in it so she did what she could pull off
the bridl and undo the girth so that the saddl would fall off
if the hors ever manag to rise the anim watch her go with
melancholi ey know that it wa be desert first it neigh
then with a desper effort it struggl to it feet and trot after
her for a hundr yard or so onli to fall down again at last jess
turn and saw it and exhaust as she wa she posit ran to get
awai from the look in those big ey that night there wa a cold rain
in which the hors perish as poor hors ar apt to do
it wa nearli dark when at length jess reach the top of the hill and
look down she knew the spot well and from it she could alwai see
the light in the kitchen window of the hous tonight there wa no
light wonder what it could mean and feel a fresh chill of doubt
creep round her heart she scrambl on down the hill when she wa
about halfwai a shower of spark suddenli shot into the air from the
spot where the hous should be caus by the fall of a piec of wall
into the smoulder ember beneath again jess paus wonder and
aghast what could have happen determin at all hazard to discov
she crept on veri cautious befor she had gone anoth twenti yard
howev a hand wa laid suddenli upon her arm she turn quickli too
paralys with fear to cry out and a voic that wa familiar to her
whisper into her ear missi jess missi jess is it you i am
jantj
she gave a sigh of relief and her heart which had stood still began
to move again here wa a friend at last
i heard you come down the hill though you came so softli he said
but i could not tell who it wa becaus you jump from rock to rock
and did not walk as usual but i thought it wa a woman with boot i
could not see becaus the light all fall dead against the hill and
the star ar not up so i got to the left of your pathfor the wind is
blow from the rightand wait till you had pass and wind you
then i knew who you were for certaineith you or missi bessi but
missi bessi is shut up so it could not be her
bessi shut up ejacul jess not even paus to marvel at the
doglik instinct that had enabl the hottentot to identifi her what
do you mean
thi wai missi come thi wai and i will tell you and he led her
to a fantast pile of rock in which it wa hi wild habit to sleep
jess knew the place well and had often peep into but never enter
the hottentot kennel
stop a bit missi i will go and light a candl i have some in there
and thei cant see the light from outsid and accordingli he vanish
in a few second he return and take her by the sleev led her
along a wind passag between great boulder till thei came to a
beehol in the rock through which she could see the light shine
go down on hi hand and knee jantj crept through and jess
follow him she found herself in a small apart about six feet
squar by eight high form for the most part by the accident fall
togeth of big boulder and roof in with on great natur slab the
place which wa light by an end of candl stuck upon the floor wa
veri dirti as might be expect of a hottentot den and in it
were collect an enorm varieti of odd and end as discard a
threeleg stool that jantj offer her jess sank down on a pile of
skin in the corner her ey fell upon a collect worthi of an old
rag and bone shop the side of the chamber were festoon with everi
imagin garment from the white fulldress coat of an austrian
offic down to a shock pair of corduroi lift by jantj from
the bodi of a bushman which he had discov in hi rambl all these
cloth were in variou stage of decai and obvious the result of
year of patient collect in the corner again were stick kerri
and two assegai a number of queershap stone and bone handl of
broken tablekn bit of the lock of gun portion of an american
clock and variou other articl which thi human jackdaw had pick
up and hidden awai altogeth it wa a strang place and vagu it
occur to jess as she sank back upon the dirti skin that had it
not been for the old cloth and the wreck of the american clock she
would have made acquaint with a veri fair exampl of the dwell
of primev man
stop befor you begin she said have you anyth to eat here i am
nearli starv
jantj grin knowingli and grub in a heap of rubbish in the
corner drew out a gourd with a piec of flat sheet iron which onc had
form the back plate of a stove place on the top of it it contain
maa or curdl buttermilk which a woman had brought him that veri
morn from a neighbour kraal and it wa destin for jantj own
supper hungri as he wa himself for he had tast no food all dai he
gave it to jess without a moment hesit togeth with a wooden
spoon and squat on the rock befor her watch her eat it with
guttur exclam of satisfact not know that she wa rob
a hungri man jess at the maa to the last spoon and wa grate
to feel the sensat of gnaw sick leav her
now she said tell me what you mean
thereon jantj began at the begin and relat the event of the dai
so far as he wa acquaint with them when he came to where the old
man wa drag with kick and blow and ignomini from hi own
hous jesss ey flash and she posit ground her teeth with
indign and as for her feel when she learnt that he wa
condemn to death and to be shot at dawn on the morrow thei ar simpli
indescrib of the bessi complic jantj wa quit ignor and
could onli tell her that frank muller had an interview with her sister
in the littl plantat after which she wa shut up in the storeroom
where she still remain but thi wa quit enough for jess who knew
muller charact better perhap than anybodi els and wa not by
ani mean ignor of hi design upon bessi a few moment thought
put the kei of the matter into her hand she saw now what wa the
reason of the grant of the pass and of the determin and partial
success attempt at wholesal murder of which thei had been the
victim she saw too why her old uncl had been condemn to deathit
wa to be us as a lever with bessi the man wa capabl even of that
ye she saw it all as clear as daylight and in her heart she swore
helpless as she seem to be that she would find a wai to prevent it
but what wai what wai ah if onli john were here but he wa not so
she must act without him if onli she could see the road to action she
thought first of all of go down boldli to face muller and denounc
him as a murder befor hi men but a moment reflect show that
thi wa impractic for hi own safeti he would be oblig to
stop her mouth somehow and the best she could expect would be to be
incarcer and render quit powerless if onli she could manag to
commun with bessi at ani rate it wa absolut necessari that
she should know what wa happen she might as well be a hundr mile
awai as a hundr yard
jantj she said tell me where the boer ar
some ar in the waggonhous missi some ar on sentri and the rest
ar down by the waggon thei brought with them and outspan behind the
gum there the cart is there too that came just befor you did with
the clergyman in it
and where is frank muller
i dont know missi but he brought a round tent with him in the
waggon and it is pitch between the two big gum
jantj i must go down there and find out what is go on and you
must come with me
you will be caught missi there is a sentri at the back of the
waggonhous and two in front but he ad perhap we might get
near i will go out and look at the night
present he return and said that a small rain had come on and the
cloud cover up the star so that it wa veri dark
well let us go at onc said jess
missi you had better not go answer the hottentot you will get
wet and the boer will catch you better let me go i can creep about
like a snake and if the boer catch me it wont matter
you must come too but i am go i must find out
then the hottentot shrug hi shoulder and yield and have
extinguish the candl silent as ghost thei crept out into the
night
chapter xxxii

could onli just catch the word
oh i suppos so but i shall dieit will kill me
he strain her to hi heart and kiss her beauti face again and
again until jess heard the heavi footstep of the return sentri
and saw muller leav go of her then jantj caught jess by the hand
drag her awai from the wall and present she wa onc more
ascend the hillsid toward the hottentot kennel she had desir
to find out how matter stood and she had found out inde to attempt
to portrai the furi the indign and the thirst to be aveng upon
thi fiend who had attempt to murder her and her lover and had bought
her dear sister honour at the price of their innoc old uncl
life would be imposs her weari had left her she wa mad with
all she had seen and heard with the knowledg of what had been done
and of what wa about to be done she even forgot her passion in it and
swore that muller should never marri bessi while she live to prevent
it had she been a bad woman herein she might have seen an opportun
for bessi onc ti to muller john would be free to marri her but
thi idea never even enter her mind whatev jesss error mai have
been she wa a selfsacrif honour woman and on who would
have di rather than profit thu by circumst at length thei
reach the shelter again and crept into it
light a candl said jess
jantj hunt for and struck a match the piec of candl thei had been
us howev wa nearli burnt out so from the rubbish in the corner
he produc a box full of end some of them three or four inch
long in the queer sort of wai that trifl do strike us when the mind
is undergo a sever strain jess rememb instantli that for year
she had been unabl to discov what becam of the odd bit of the
candl us in the hous now the mysteri wa explain
go outsid and leav me i want to think she said
the hottentot obei and seat upon the heap of skin her forehead
rest on her hand and her finger buri in her silki rainsoak
hair jess began to review the posit it wa evid to her that
frank muller would be as good as hi word she knew him too well to
doubt thi for a moment if bessi did not marri him he would murder
the old man as he had tri to murder herself and john onli thi time
judici and then abduct her sister afterward she wa the onli
price that he wa prepar to take in exchang for her uncl life but
it wa imposs to allow bessi to be so sacrif the thought wa
horribl to her
how then wa it to be prevent
she thought again of confront frank muller and openli accus him
of her attempt murder onli howev to dismiss the idea who would
believ her and if thei did believ what good would it do she would
onli be imprison and kept out of harm wai or possibl murder out
of hand then she thought of attempt to commun with her uncl
and bessi to tell them that john wa so far as she knew aliv
onli to recognis the imposs of do so now that the sentri had
return besid what object could be serv the knowledg that john
wa aliv might it is true encourag bessi to resist muller but then
the death of the old man must certainli ensu dismiss thi
project from her mind jess began to consid whether thei could obtain
assist ala it wa imposs the onli peopl from whom she could
hope for aid would be the nativ and now that the boer had triumph
over the englishfor thi much she had gather from her captor and
from jantjeit wa veri doubt if the kafir would dare to assist
her besid at the best it would take twentyfour hour to collect a
forc and by then help would come too late the situat wa hopeless
nowher could she see a rai of light
what jess said aloud to herselfwhat is there in the world that
will stop a man like frank muller
and then of an instant the answer rose up in her brain as though by
inspir
death
death and death alon would stai him for a minut she held the idea
in her mind till she grew familiar with it then it wa driven out by
anoth thought that follow swiftli on it track frank muller must
die and die befor the morn light by no other possibl mean could
the gordian knot be cut and both bessi and her old uncl be save if
he were dead he could not marri bessi and if he di with the warrant
unsign their uncl could not be execut that wa the terribl answer
to her riddl
yet it wa most just that he should die for had he not murder and
attempt murder sure if ever a man deserv a swift and aw doom
that man wa frank muller
and so thi forsaken helpless girl crouch upon the ground a torn
and bespatt fugit in the miser hidinghol of a hottentot
arraign the power leader of men befor the tribun of her
conscienc and without piti if without wrath pass upon him a
sentenc of extinct
but who wa to be the execution a dread thought flash into her
mind and made her heart stand still but she dismiss it no she had
not come to that her ey wander round the kennel lit upon
jantj assegai and stick in the corner and these gave her anoth
inspir jantj should do the deed
john had told her on dai when thei were sit togeth in the
palati at pretoria the whole of jantj aw stori about the
massacr of hi rel by frank muller twenti year befor of which
inde she alreadi knew someth it would be most fit that thi
fiend should be remov from the face of the earth by the survivor of
those unfortun that would be poetic justic and justic is so rare
in the world but the question wa would he do it the littl man wa
a wonder coward that she knew and had a great terror of boer and
especi of frank muller
jantj she whisper stoop toward the beehol
yah missi answer a hoars voic outsid and next second the
hottentot monkeylik face came creep into the ring of light
follow by hi even more monkeylik form
sit down there jantj i am lone here and want to talk
he obei her with a grin what shall we talk about missi shall i
tell you a stori of the time when the beast could speak as i us to
do year and year ago
no jantj tell me about that stickthat long stick with a knob at
the top and the nick cut on it ha it not someth to do with frank
muller
the hottentot face instantli grew evil yah yah missi he said

missi bessi and jantj drew from hi side hi larg whitehandl
huntingknif and began to cut them then and there upon the hard wood of
the stick
jess knew thi knife of old it wa jantj peculiar treasur the
chief joi of hi narrow littl heart he had brought it from a zulu for
a heifer which her uncl had given him in lieu of half a year wage
the zulu had it from a halfcast whose kraal wa beyond delagoa bai
as a matter of fact it wa a somali knife manufactur from the soft
nativ steel which take an edg like a razor and with a handl cut out
of the tusk of a hippopotamu for the rest it wa about a foot long
with three groov run the length of the blade and veri heavi
stop cut notch jantj and let me look at that knife
he obei and put it into her hand
that knife would kill a man jantj she said
ye ye he answer no doubt it ha kill mani men
it would kill frank muller now would it not she went on suddenli
bend forward and fix her dark ey upon the littl man jaundic
orb
yah yah he said start back it would kill him dead ah what a
thing it would be to kill him he ad make a fierc sound half
grunt half laugh

hi teeth and saw the air with hi clench fist

the hottentot start and turn pale under hi yellow skin

some minut into hi ear

to be clever like the white peopl i will kill him tonight and then

chapter xxxiii
vengeanc
for three or four minut more jess and jantj whisper togeth after
which the hottentot rose and crept awai to find out what wa pass
among the boer below and watch when frank muller retir to hi tent
so soon as he had mark him down it wa agre that he wa to come back
and report to jess
when he wa gone jess gave a sigh of relief thi stir up of jantj
to the boilingpoint of vengeanc had been a dread thing to nerv
herself to do but now at ani rate it wa done and muller doom wa
seal but what the end of it would be none could sai practic she
would be a murderess and she felt that sooner or later her guilt must
find her out and then she could hope for littl merci still she had no
scrupl for after all frank muller would be a wellmerit fate
but when all wa said and done it wa a dread thing to be forc to
steep her hand in blood even for bessi sake if muller were remov
bessi would marri john provid that john escap the boer and be
happi but what would becom of herself rob of her love and with
thi crime upon her mind what could she do even if she escapedexcept
die it would be better to die and never see him again for her sorrow
and her shame were more than she could bear then jess began to think
of john till all her poor bruis heart seem to go out toward him
bessi could never love him as she did she felt sure of that and yet
bessi wa to have him by her all her life and shesh must go awai
well it wa the onli thing to do she would see thi deed done and set
her sister free then if she happen to escap she would go at oncego
quit awai where she would never be heard of again thu at ani rate
she would have behav like an honour woman she sat up and put her
hand to her face it wa burn hot though she wa wet through and
chill to the bone with the raw damp of the night a fierc fever of
mind and bodi had taken hold of her worn out as she wa with emot
hunger and protract exposur but her brain wa clear enough she
never rememb it be so clear befor everi thought that came into
her mind seem to present itself with startl strength stand out
alon against a black background of nothing not soften down and
shade on into anoth as thought gener ar she seem to see
herself wander awayalon utterli alon alon for everwhil in
the far distanc john stood hold bessi by the hand gaze after her
regretfulli well she would write to him sinc it must be so and bid
him on word of farewel she could not go without that though how her
letter wa to reach john she knew not unless inde jantj could find
him and deliv it she had a pencil and in the breast of her dress wa
the boer pass the back of which stain as it wa with water would
serv the purpos of paper she found it and bend forward toward
the light place it on her knee
goodby she wrote goodby we can never meet again and it is
better that we never should in thi world i believ that there is
anoth if there is i shall wait for you there if i have to wait ten
thousand year if not then goodby for ever think of me sometim

realli dead to you until i am forgottenj
she lift the paper from her knee and without even reread what
she had written thrust the pass back into her bosom and wa soon lost in
thought
ten minut later jantj like a great snake in human form came
creep in to where she sat hi yellow face shine with the
raindrop
well whisper jess look up with a start have you done it
no missi no baa frank ha but now gone to hi tent he ha been
talk to the clergyman someth about missi bessi i dont know
what i wa near but he talk low and i could onli hear the name

is there a sentri befor baa frank tent
no missi there is nobodi near
what is the time jantj
about three hour and a half after sundown halfpast ten
let us wait half an hour and then you must go
accordingli thei sat in silenc in silenc thei sat face each other
and their own thought present jantj broke it by draw the big
whitehandl knife and commenc to sharpen it on a piec of leather
the sight made jess feel sick put the knife up she said quickli it
is sharp enough
jantj obei with a feebl grin and the minut pass on heavili
now jantj she said at last speak huskili in her struggl to
overcom the spasmod contract of her throat it is time for you
to go
the hottentot fidget about and at last spoke
missi must come with me
come with you answer jess start why
becaus the ghost of the old englishwoman will be after me if i go
alon
you fool said jess angrili then recollect herself she ad
come be a man jantj think of your father and mother and be a man
i am a man he answer sulkili and i will kill him like a man but
what good is a man against the ghost of a dead englishwoman if i put
the knife into her she would onli make face and fire would come out of
the hole i will not go without you missi
you must go she said fierc you shall go
no missi i will not go alon he answer
jess look at him and saw that jantj meant what he said he wa
grow sulki and the worst disposit donkei in the world is far
far easier to deal with than a sulki hottentot she must either give up
the project or go with the man well she wa equal guilti on wai or
the other and be almost callou about detect she might as well
go she had no power left to make fresh plan her mind seem to be
exhaust onli she must keep out of the wai at the last she could not
bear to be near then
well she said i will go with you jantj
good missi that is all right now you can keep off the ghost of the
dead englishwoman while i kill baa frank but first he must be fast
asleep fast fast asleep
then slowli and with the uttermost caution onc more thei crept down the
hill thi time there wa no sound to be heard except the regular tramp
of the sentri but their present busi did not take them to the
waggonhous thei left that on their right and went on toward the
bluegum avenu when thei were nearli opposit to the first tree thei
halt in a patch of stone and jantj slip forward to reconnoitr
present he return with the intellig that all the boer who were
with the waggon had gone to sleep but that muller wa still sit in
hi tent think then thei crept on perfectli sure that if thei were
not heard thei would not be seen curtain as thei were by the dens
mist and dark
at length thei reach the bole of the first big gum tree five pace
from thi tree frank muller tent wa pitch there wa a light in
it which caus the wet tent to glow in the mist as though it had been
rub with phosphoru and on thi lurid canva the shadow of frank
muller wa gigant limn he wa so place that the lamp cast a
magnifi reflect of hi everi featur and even of hi express
upon the screen befor them the attitud in which he sat wa hi
favourit on when he wa plung in thought hi hand rest on hi
knee and hi gaze fix on vacanc he wa think of hi triumph
and of all that he had gone through to win it and of all that it would
bring him he held the trump card now and the game lai in hi own
hand he had triumph and yet over him hung the shadow of that curs
which dog the presenc of our accomplish desir too often even
with the innoc doe the seed of our destruct lurk in the rich
blossom of our hope and much more is thi so with the guilti somehow
thi thought wa present with him tonight and in a rough halfeduc
wai he grasp it truth onc more the sai of the old boer gener
rose in hi mind i believ that there is a godi believ that god
set a limit to a man do if he is go too far god kill
him
what a dread thing it would be if the old fool were right after all
suppos that there were a god and god were to kill him tonight and
hurri off hi soul if he had on to some dim place of unend fear
all hi superstit awok at the thought and he shiver so violent
that the shadow of the shiver caus the outlin of the gigant form
upon the canva to trembl visibl
then rise with an angri curs muller hastili threw off hi outer
cloth and have turn down but not extinguish the rough
parrafin lamp he flung himself down upon the littl camp bedstead
which creak and groan beneath hi weight like a thing in pain
now came silenc onli broken by the drip drip of the rain from the gum
leav overhead and the rattl of the bough whenev a breath of air
stir them it wa an eeri and depress night a night that might
well have tri the nerv of ani strong man who wet through and worn
out wa oblig to crouch upon the open veldt and endur it how
much more aw wa it then to the unfortun woman who half
brokenheart feverstricken and wellnigh craze with the suffer
of mind and bodi wait in it to see murder done slowli the minut
pass and at everi raindrop or rustl of a bough her guilti conscienc
summon up a host of fear but by the mere power of her will she kept
them down she would go through with it ye she would go through with
it sure he must be asleep by now
thei crept up to the tent and place their ear within two inch of hi
head ye he wa asleep the sound of hi breath rose and fell with
the regular of an infant
jess turn round and touch her companion upon the shoulder he did
not move but she felt that hi arm wa shake
now she whisper
still he hung back it wa evid to her that the long wait had
taken the courag out of him
be a man she whisper again so low that the sound scarc reach
hi ear although her lip were almost touch them go and mind you
strike home
then at last she heard him softli draw the great knife from the sheath
and in anoth second he had glide from her side present she saw the
line of light that stream upon the dark through the open of the
tent broaden a littl and by thi she knew that he wa creep in upon
hi dread errand then she turn her head and put her finger in her
ear but even so she could see a long line of shadow travel across
the skirt of the tent so she shut her ey also and wait sick at
heart for she did not dare to move
presentlyit might have been five minut or onli half a minut
afterward for she had lost count of timejess felt somebodi touch her
on the arm it wa jantj
is it done she whisper again
he shook hi head and drew her awai from the tent in go her foot
caught on of the guyrop and stir it slightli
i could not do it missi he said he is asleep and look just like
a child when i lift the knife he smile in hi sleep and all the
strength went out of my arm so that i could not strike and then befor
i grew strong again the spook of the old englishwoman came and hit me in
the back and i ran awai
if a look could have blast a human be jantj would assuredli have
been blast then the man cowardic madden jess but whilst she
still choke with wrath a duiker buck which had come down from it
stoni home to feed upon the rosebush suddenli sprang with a crash
almost from their feet pass awai like a grei gleam into the utter
dark
jess start then recov herself guess what it wa but the
miser hottentot overcom with terror fell upon the ground groan
out that it wa the spook of the old englishwoman he had drop the
knife as he fell and jess see the immin peril in which thei were
place knelt down found it and hiss into hi ear that if he were
not quiet she would kill him
thi pacifi him a littl but no earthli power could persuad him to
enter the tent again
what wa to be done what could she do for two minut or more she
buri her face in her wet hand and thought wildli and despairingli
then a dark and dread determin enter her mind the man muller
should not escap bessi should not be sacrif to him rather than
that she would do the deed herself
without a word she rose anim by the tragic agoni of her purpos and
the forc of her despair and glide toward the tent the great knife
in her hand now ah all too soon she wa insid of it and stood for
a second to allow her ey to grow accustom to the light present
she began to see first the outlin of the bed then the outlin of the
manli form stretch upon it then both bed and man distinctli jantj
had said that he wa sleep like a child he might have been now he
wa not on the contrari hi face wa convuls like the face of on
in an extrem of fear and great bead of sweat stood upon hi brow
it wa as though he knew hi danger and yet wa utterli powerless to
avoid it he lai upon hi back on heavi arm hi left hung over the
side of the bed the knuckl of the hand rest on the ground the
other wa thrown back and hi head wa pillow upon it the cloth
had slip awai from hi throat and massiv chest which were quit
bare
jess stood and gaze for bessi sake for bessi sake she
murmur then impel by a forc that seem to move of itself she
crept slowli slowli to the righthand side of the bed
at thi moment muller woke and hi open ey fell full upon
her face whatev hi dream had been what he now saw wa far more
terribl for bend over him wa the ghost of the woman he had
murder in the vaal there she wa risen from her river grave torn
dishevel water yet drip from her hand and hair those sunk
and marbl cheek those dread flame ey could belong to no human
be but onli to a spirit it wa the spirit of jess croft of the
woman whom he had slain come back to tell him that there wa a live
vengeanc and a hell
their ey met and no creatur will ever know the agoni of terror that
he tast of befor the end came she saw hi face sink in and turn
ashen grei while the cold sweat ran from everi pore he wa awak but
fear paralys him he could not speak or move
he wa awak and she could hesit no more
he must have seen the flash of the fall steel and
jess wa outsid the tent again the red knife in her hand she flung
the accurs thing from her that shriek must have awaken everi soul
within a mile alreadi she could faintli hear the stir of men down by
the waggon and the patter of the feet of jantj run for hi life
then she too turn and fled straight up the hill she knew not
whither she care not where none saw her or follow her the hunt had
broken awai to the left after jantj her heart wa lead and her brain
a rock sea of fire whilst befor her around her and behind her
yell all the consciencecr furi that run murder to hi lair
on she flew on sight onli befor her ey on sound onli in her ear
on over the hill far into the rain and the night

john pour out and swallow half a tumbler of the brandi and in
anoth moment he wa outsid the hous and had slip off into the
night it wa veri dark and wet for the raincloud had cover up the
moon and he soon learn that ani attempt to look for hi hors would
end in failur and probabl in hi recaptur the onli thing to do wa
to get awai on foot in the direct of mooifontein as quickli as he
could so off he went down the track across the veldt as fast as hi
stiff leg would take him he had a ten mile trudg befor him and
with that cheer acquiesc in circumst over which he had no
control which wa on of hi characterist he set to work to make the
best of it for the first hour or so all went well then to hi intens
disgust he discov that he wa off the track a fact at which anybodi
who ha ever had the pleasur of wander along a socal road on the
african veldt on a dark night will scarc be surpris
after wast a quarter of an hour or more in a vain attempt to find the
path john struck out boldli for a dim mass that loom in the distanc
and which he took to be mooifontein hill and so it wa onli instead of
keep to the left where he would have arriv at the hous or rather
where the hous had stood unwittingli he bore to the right and thu
went half round the hill befor he found out hi mistak nor would he
have discov it then had he not chanc in the mist and dark to
turn into the mouth of the great gorg known as leeuwen kloof where
onc month ago he had had an interest talk with jess just befor
she went to pretoria it wa whilst he wa blunder and stumbl up
thi gorg that at length the rain ceas and the moon reveal herself
it be then nearli midnight her veri first rai lit upon on of the
extraordinari pillar of balanc boulder and by it he recognis the
local as mai be imagin strong man though he wa by thi time
john wa quit exhaust for nearli a week he had been travel
incessantli and for the last two night he had not onli not slept but
also had endur much mental excit and bodili peril were it not
for the brandi that tanta coetze gave him he could never have tramp
the fifteen mile or so of ground which he had cover now he wa quit
broken down and felt that the onli thing which he could do wet through
as he wa would be to lie down somewher and sleep or die as the case
might be then it wa that he rememb the littl cave near the top
of the kloof the same from which jess had watch the thunderstorm he
had visit it onc with bessi after their engag and she had told
him that it wa on of her sister favourit haunt
if he could but reach the cave at ani rate he would find shelter and a
dry place to lie in it could not be more than three hundr yard awai
so he struggl on brave through the wet grass and over the scatter
boulder till at last he came to the base of the huge column that had
been shatter by the lightn befor jesss ey
thirti pace more and john wa in the cave
with a sigh of utter exhaust he flung himself down upon the rocki
floor and almost instantli wa buri in a profound sleep
chapter xxxv
the conclus of the matter
when the rain ceas and the moon began to shine jess wa still flee
like a wild thing across the plain on the top of the mountain she felt
no sens of exhaust now or even of weari her onli idea wa to
get awai right awai somewher where she could lose herself and nobodi
would ever see her again present she reach to top of leeuwen kloof
and recognis the spot in a bewild wai she began to descend it
here wa a place where she might lie till she di for no on ever came
there except now and again some wander kafir herd on she sprang
from rock to rock a wild and eeri figur well in keep with the
solemn and titan sad of the place
twice she fell onc right into the stream but she took no heed
she did not even seem to feel it at last she wa at the bottom now
creep like a black dot across the wide space of moonlight and now
swallow up in the shadow there befor her gape the mouth of the
littl cave her strength wa leav her at last and she wa fain to
crawl into it brokenheart craze anddi
oh god forgiv me god forgiv me she moan as she sank upon the
rocki floor bessi i sin against you but i have wash awai my
sin i did it for you bessi love not for myself i had rather have
di than kill him for myself you will marri john now and you will
never never know what i did for you i am go to die i know that
i am dy oh if onli i could see hi face onc more befor i
diebefor i die
slowli the wester moonlight crept down the black of the rock now
at last it peep into the littl cave and plai upon john sleep
face ly within six feet of her her prayer had been grant there
wa her lover by her side
with a start and a great sigh of doubt she recognis him wa it a
vision wa he dead she drag herself to him upon her hand and knee
and listen for hi breath if perchanc he still breath and wa
not a wraith then it came strong and slow the breath of a man in deep
sleep
so he live should she try to wake him what for to tell him she wa
a murderess and then to let him see her die for instinct told her that
natur wa exhaust and she knew that she wa certainli goinggo
fast no a hundr time no
onli she put her hand into her breast and draw out the pass on the
back of which she had written her last messag to him she thrust it
between hi listless finger it should speak for her then she leant
over him and watch hi sleep face a veri incarn of infinit
despair tender and love that is deeper than the grave and as
she watch gradual her feet and leg grew cold and numb till at
length she could feel noth below her bosom she wa dead nearli to
the heart well it wa better so
the rai of the moon fade slowli from the level of the littl cave and
john face grew dark to her darken sight she bent down and kiss
him oncetwicethric
at last the end came there wa a great flash of light befor her
ey and within her ear the roar as of a thousand sea and her
head sank gentli on her lover breast as on a pillow and there jess
di and pass upward toward the wider life and larger liberti or at
the least downward into the depth of rest
poor darkei deepheart jess thi wa the fruition of her love
and thi her bridal bed
it wa done she had gone take with her the secret of her
selfsacrific and crime and the nightwind moan amidst the rock
sang their requiem over her here she first had learn her love and
here she close it book on earth
she might have been a great and a good woman she might even have been a
happi woman but fate had ordain it otherwis women such as jess ar
rare happi in the world it is not worldli wise to stake all on
fortun on a throw and lack the craft to load the dice well her
troubl ar done with think gentli of her and let her pass in peac
the hour grew on toward the even but john the dead face of the
woman he had love still pillow on hi breast neither dream nor
woke there wa a strang and dread ironi in the situat an ironi
which sometim find it counterpart in our wake life but still the
man slept and the dead girl lai till the night turn into the morn
and the earth woke up as usual the sunbeam slid into the cave and
plai indiffer upon the ashen face and tangl curl and on the
broad chest of the live man whereon thei rest an old baboon peep
round the rocki edg and manifest no surpris onli indign at
the intrus of human dead or aliv into hi dominion ye the
world woke up as usual and reck not and troubl not becaus jess wa
dead
it is so accustom to such sight
at last john woke up also he stretch hi arm yawn and for the
first time becam awar of the weight upon hi breast he glanc down
and saw dimli at firstthen more clearli
there ar some thing into which it is wisest not to pry and on of
them is the first agoni of a strong man grief
happi wa it for john that hi brain did not give wai in that lone
hour of bottomless despair but he live through it as we do live
through such thing and wa sane and sound after it though it left it
mark upon hi life
two hour later a gaunt haggard figur stumbl down the hillsid
toward the site of mooifontein bear someth in hi arm the
whole place wa in commot here and there were knot of boer talk
excitedli who when thei saw the man come hurri up to learn who
it wa and what he carri but when thei knew thei fell back aw and
without a word and john too pass through them without a word for
a moment he hesit see that the hous wa burnt down then he
turn into the waggonsh and laid hi burden down on the sawbench
where frank muller had sat as judg upon the previou dai
now at last john spoke in a hoars voic where is the old man
on of them point to the door of the littl room
open it he said so fierc that again thei fell back and obei him
without a word
john john cri sila croft rise amaz from hi seat upon a
sack thank godyou have come back to us from the dead and trembl
with joi and surpris he would have fallen on hi neck
hush he answer i have brought the dead with me
and he led him to where jess lai
dure the dai all the boer went awai and left them alon now that
frank muller lai dead there wa no thought among them of carri out
the sentenc upon their old neighbour besid there wa no warrant for
the execut even had thei desir so to do for their command
di leav it unsign so thei held an inform inquest upon their
leader bodi and buri him in the littl graveyard that wa wall in
on the hillsid at the back of where the hous had stood and plant
with the four red gum on at each corner rather than be at the pain
of hollow anoth grave thei buri him in the veri place that he
had caus to be dug to receiv the bodi of sila croft
who had murder frank muller wa and remain a mysteri among them
to thi dai the knife wa identifi by nativ about the farm as
belong to the hottentot jantj and a hottentot had been seen run
awai from the place of the deed and hunt for some wai but he could
not be caught or heard of again therefor mani of them ar of the
opinion that he is the guilti man other again believ that the crime
rest upon the shoulder of the villain oneei kafir hendrik
muller own servant who had also vanish but as thei have never
found either of them and ar not like to do so the point remain a
moot on nor inde did thei take ani great pain to hunt for them
frank muller wa not a popular charact and the fact of a man come
to a mysteri end doe not produc ani great sensat among a rough
peopl and in rough time
on the follow dai old sila croft bessi and john niel also buri
their dead in the littl graveyard on the hillsid and there jess
li with some ten feet of earth onli between her and the man upon whom
she wa the instrument of vengeanc but thei never knew thi or even
guess it thei never knew inde that she had been near mooifontein on
that aw night nobodi knew it except jantj and jantj haunt by
the footfal of the pursu boer wa gone from the ken of the white
man far into the heart of central africa
john said the old man when thei had fill in the grave thi is no
countri for englishmen let us go home to england john bow hi head
in assent for he could not speak fortun mean were not want
although practic thei were both ruin the thousand pound that
john had paid to sila as the price of a third interest in the farm
still lai to the credit of the latter in the standard bank at newcastl
in natal togeth with anoth two hundr and fifti pound in cash
and so in due cours thei went
now what more is there to tell jess to those who read what ha been
written as it is meant to be read wa the soul of it all and jessi
dead it is useless to set a lifeless thing upon it feet rather let us
strive to follow the soar of the spirit jess is dead and her stori
at an end
so but on word more
after some difficulti john niel within three month of hi arriv
in england obtain employ as a land agent to a larg estat
in rutlandshir which posit he fill to thi dai with credit to
himself and such advantag to the properti as can be expect in these
time also in due cours he becam the belov husband of sweet bessi
croft and on the whole he mai be consid a happi man at time
howev a sorrow overcom him of which hi wife know noth and for
a while he is not himself
he is not a man much addict to sentiment or specul but sometim
when hi dai work is done and he strai to hi garden gate and look
out at the dim and peac english landscap beyond and thenc to the
wide starstrewn heaven abov he wonder if the hour will ever come
when onc more he will see those dark and passion ey and hear that
sweet rememb voic
for john feel as near to hi lost love now that she is dead as he
felt while she wa yet aliv from time to time inde he seem to know
without possibl of doubt that if when death is done with there
should prove to be an individu futur for us suffer mortal as he
for on believ certainli he will find jess wait to greet him at
it gate
