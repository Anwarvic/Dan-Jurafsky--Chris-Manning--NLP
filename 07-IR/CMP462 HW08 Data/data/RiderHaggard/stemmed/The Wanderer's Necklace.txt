it chanc that i the editor of these pagesfor in truth that is
my humbl functionhav recov a consider knowledg of a bygon
life of mine thi life end in time that ar compar recent
name earli in the ninth centuri as is fix by the fact that the
byzantin empress iren plai a part in the stori
the narr it will be observ is not absolut consecut that

and rise again in byzantium onli those event which were of the most
import seem to have burn themselv into my subconsci memori
mani minor detail have vanish or at least i cannot find them

chapter i
the betroth of olaf
of my childhood in thi olaf life i can regain but littl there come to
me howev recollect of a hous surround by a moat situat in
a great plain near to sea or inland lake on which plain stood mound
that i connect with the dead what the dead were i did not quit
understand but i gather that thei were peopl who have onc walk
about and been awak now laid themselv down in a bed of earth and
slept i rememb look at a big mound which wa said to cover a chief
known as the wander whom freydisa the wise woman my nurs told
me had live hundr or thousand of year befor and think that so
much earth over him must make him veri hot at night
i rememb also that the hall call aar wa a long hous roof with
sod on which grew grass and sometim littl white flower and that
insid of it cow were ti up we live in a place beyond that wa
separ off from the cow by balk of rough timber i us to watch
them be milk through a crack between two of the balk where a
knot had fallen out leav a conveni eyehol about the height of a
walkingstick from the floor
on dai my elder and onli brother ragnar who had veri red hair came
and pull me awai from thi eyehol becaus he want to look through
it himself at a cow that alwai kick the girl who milk it i howl
and steinar my fosterbroth who had lightcolour hair and blue
ey and wa much bigger and stronger than i came to my help becaus
we alwai love each other he fought ragnar and made hi nose bleed
after which my mother the ladi thora who wa veri beauti box
hi ear then we all cri and my father thorvald a tall man rather
loos made who had come in from hunt for he carri the skin of
some anim of which the blood had run down on to hi leg scold
us and told my mother to keep us quiet as he wa tire and want to
eat
that is the onli scene which return to me of my infanc
the next of which a vision ha come to me is on of a somewhat similar
hous to our own in aar upon an island call lesso where we were all
visit a chief of the name of athalbrand he wa a fiercelook
man with a great fork beard from which he wa call athalbrand
forkbeard on of hi nostril wa larger than the other and he had a
droop in hi left ey both of which peculiar came to him from some
wound or wound that he had receiv in war in those dai everybodi wa
at war with everybodi els and it wa quit uncommon for anyon to live
until hi hair turn grei
the reason of our visit to thi chief athalbrand wa that my elder
brother ragnar might be betroth to hi onli surviv child iduna
all of whose brother had been kill in some battl i can see iduna
now as she wa when she first appear befor us we were sit at
tabl and she enter through a door at the top of the hall she
wa cloth in a blue robe her long fair hair whereof she had an
abund wa arrang in two plait which hung almost to her knee
and about her neck and arm were massiv gold ring that tinkl as she
walk she had a round face colour like a wild rose and innoc
blue ey that took in everyth although she alwai seem to look
in front of her and see noth her lip were veri red and appear to
smile altogeth i thought her the loveliest creatur that ever i had
look on and she walk like a deer and held her head proudli
still she did not pleas ragnar who whisper to me that she wa sly
and would bring mischief on all that had to do with her i who at the
time wa about twentyon year of ag wonder if he had gone mad to
talk thu of thi beauti creatur then i rememb that just befor
we had left home i had caught ragnar kiss the daughter of on of our
thrall behind the shed in which the calv were kept she wa a brown
girl veri well made as her rough robe fasten beneath her breast
with a strap show plainli and she had big dark ey with a sleepi
look in them also i never saw anyon kiss quit so hard as she did
ragnar himself wa outpass i think that is why even the great ladi
iduna the fair did not pleas him all the while he wa think of the
brownei girl in the russet robe still it is true that brownei
girl or no he read iduna aright
moreov if ragnar did not like iduna from the first iduna hate
ragnar so it came about that although both my father thorvald and
iduna father athalbrand storm and threaten these two declar
that thei would have noth to do with each other and the project of
their marriag came to an end
on the night befor we were to leav lesso whenc ragnar had alreadi
gone athalbrand saw me stare at iduna thi inde wa not
wonder as i could not take my ey from her love face and when
she look at me and smile with those red lip of her i becam like a
silli bird that is bewitch by a snake at first i thought that he wa
go to be angri but suddenli some idea seem to strike him so that
he call my father thorvald outsid the hous afterward i wa sent
for and found the two of them seat on a threecorn flat stone
talk in the moonlight for it wa summertim when everyth look
blue at night and the sun and the moon ride in the sky togeth near by
stood my mother listen
olaf said my father would you like to marri iduna the fair
like to marri iduna i gasp ay more than to be high king of
denmark for she is no woman but a goddess
at thi sai my mother laugh and athalbrand who knew iduna when
she did not seem a goddess call me a fool then thei talk while i
stood trembl with hope and fear
he but a second son said athalbrand
i have told you there is land enough for both of them also the
gold that came with hi mother will be hi and that no small sum
answer thorvald
he no warrior but a skald object athalbrand again a silli
halfman who make song and plai upon the harp
song ar sometim stronger than sword repli my father and
after all it is wisdom that rule on brain can govern mani men also
harp make merri music at a feast moreov olaf is brave enough how
can he be otherwis come of the stock he doe
he is thin and weedi object athalbrand a sai that made my
mother angri
nai lord athalbrand she said he is tall and straight as a dart
and will yet be the handsomest man in these part
everi duck think it ha hatch out a swan grumbl athalbrand
while with my ey i implor my mother to be silent
then he thought for awhil pull at hi long fork beard and said
at last
my heart tell me no good of such a marriag iduna who is the onli
on left to me could marri a man of more wealth and power than thi
runemak stripl is ever like to be yet just now i know none
such whom i would wish to hold my place when i am gone moreov it is
spread far and wide throughout the land that my daughter is to be wed to
thorvald son and it matter littl to which son at least i will not
have it said that she ha been given the gobi therefor let thi olaf
take her if she will have him onli he ad with a growl let him
plai no trick like that redhead cub hi brother ragnar if he would
not tast of a spear through hi liver now i go to learn iduna mind
so he went as did my father and mother leav me alon think and
thank the god for the chanc that had come my wayy and bless
ragnar and that brownei wench who had thrown her spell over him
whilst i stood thu i heard a sound and turn saw iduna glide
toward me in the blue twilight look more love than a dream at my
side she stop and said
my father tell me you wish to speak with me and she laugh a littl
softli and held me with her beauti ey
after that i know not what happen till i saw iduna bend toward
me like a willow in the wind and thenoh joi of joysfelt her kiss
upon my lip now my speech wa unseal and i told her the tale that
lover have alwai told how that i wa readi to die for her to which
she answer that she had rather that i live sinc ghost were no good
husband how that i wa not worthi of her to which she answer that
i wa young with all my time befor me and might live to be greater
than i thought as she believ i should and so forth
onli on more thing come back to me of that bliss hour foolishli i
said what i had been think name that i bless ragnar at these
word of a sudden iduna face grew stern and the lovelight in her ey
wa chang to such as gleam from sword
i do not bless ragnar she answer i hope on dai to see
ragnar and she check herself ad come let us enter olaf
i hear my father call me to mix hi sleepingcup
so we went into the hous hand in hand and when thei saw us come
thu all gather there burst into shout of laughter after their rude
fashion moreov beaker were thrust into our hand and we were made
to drink from them and swear some oath thu end our betroth
i think it wa on the next dai that we sail for home in my father
largest ship of war which wa name the swan i went unwillingli
enough who desir to drink more of the delight of iduna ey still
go i must sinc athalbrand would have it so the marriag he said
should take place at aar at the time of the spring feast and not
befor meanwhil he held it best we should be apart that we might learn
whether we still clung to each other in absenc
these were the reason he gave but i think that he wa alreadi somewhat
sorri for what he had done and reflect that between harvest and
springtim he might find anoth husband for iduna who wa more to
hi mind for athalbrand as i learn afterward wa a scheme and a
falseheart man moreov he wa of no high lineag but on who had
rais himself up by war and plunder and therefor hi blood did not
compel him to honour
the next scene which come back to me of those earli dai is that of the
hunt of the white northern bear when i save the life of steinar my
fosterbroth and nearli lost my own
it wa on a dai when the winter wa merg into spring but the
coastlin near aar wa still thick with pack ic and larg floe which
had float in from the more northern sea a certain fisherman who
dwelt on thi shore came to the hall to tell us that he had seen a great
white bear on on of these floe which he believ had swum from it
to the land he wa a man with a clubfoot and i can recal a vision
of him limp across the snow toward the drawbridg of aar support
himself by a staff on the top of which wa cut the figur of some
anim
young lord he cri out there is a white bear on the land such a
bear as onc i saw when i wa a boi come out and kill the bear and win
honour but first give me a drink for my new
at that time i think my father thorvald wa awai from home with most
of the men i do not know why but ragnar steinar and i were linger
about the stead with littl or noth to do sinc the time of sow
wa not yet at the new of the clubfoot man we ran for our spear
and on of us went to tell the onli thrall who could be spare to make
readi the hors and come with us thora my mother would have stop
ussh said she had heard from her father that such bear were veri
danger beastsbut ragnar onli thrust her asid while i kiss her
and told her not to fret
outsid the hall i met freydisa a dark quiet woman of middl ag
on of the virgin of odin whom i love and who love me and save on
other me onli among men for she had been my nurs
whither now young olaf she ask me ha iduna come here that you
run so fast
no i answer but a white bear ha
oh then thing ar better than i thought who fear lest it might
be iduna befor her time still you go on an ill errand from which i
think you will return sadli
why do you sai that freydisa i ask is it just becaus you love
to croak like a raven on a rock or for some good reason
i dont know olaf she answer i sai thing becaus thei come to
me and i must that is all i tell you that evil will be born of thi
bear hunt of your and you had better stop at home
to be laugh at by my brethren freydisa moreov you ar foolish
for if evil is to be how can i avoid it either your foresight is
noth or the evil must come
that is so answer freydisa from your childhood up you had the
gift of reason which is more than is grant to most of these fool
about us go olaf and meet your foreordain evil still kiss me
befor you go lest we should not see each other again for a while if
the bear kill you at least you will be save from iduna
now while she said these word i wa kiss freydisa whom i love
dearli but when i understood them i leapt back befor she could kiss me
again
what do you mean by your talk about iduna i ask iduna is my
betroth and ill suffer no ill speech of her
i know she is olaf youv got ragnar leav although he is so
hothead ragnar is a wise dog in some wai who can tell what he
should not eat there begon you think me jealou of iduna as old
women can be but it not that my dear oh youll learn befor all is
done if you live begon begon ill tell you no more hark ragnar
is shout to you and she push me awai
it wa a long ride to where the bear wa suppos to be at first as we
went we talk a great deal and made a wager as to which of the three
of us should first drive a spear into the beast bodi so deep that the
blade wa hidden but afterward i grew silent inde i wa muse so
much of iduna and how the time drew near when onc more i should see her
sweet face wonder also why ragnar and freydisa should think so ill
of her who seem a goddess rather than a woman that i forgot all about
the bear so complet did i forget it that when be by natur veri
observ i saw the slot of such a beast as we pass a certain birch
wood i did not think to connect it with that which we were hunt or
to point it out to the other who were ride ahead of me
at length we came to the sea and there sure enough saw a great
iceflo which now and again tilt as the surg caught it broad green
flank when it tilt toward us we perceiv a track worn deep into the
ic by the paw of the prison bear as it had march endlessli round
also we saw a big grin skull whereon sat a raven pick at the
eyehol and some fragment of white fur
the bear is dead exclaim ragnar odin curs be on that
clubfoot fool who gave us thi cold ride for noth
ye i suppos so said steinar doubtfulli dont you think that it
is dead olaf
what is the good of ask olaf broke in ragnar with a loud laugh
what doe olaf know about bear he ha been asleep for the last
halfhour dream of athalbrand blueei daughter or perhap he is
make up anoth poem
olaf see farther when he seem asleep than some of us do when we ar
awak answer steinar hotli
oh ye repli ragnar sleep or wake olaf is perfect in your
ey for youv drunk the same milk and that ti you tighter than a
rope wake up now brother olaf and tell us is not the bear dead
then i answer why of cours a bear is dead see it skull also
piec of it hide
there exclaim ragnar our famili prophet ha settl the matter
let us go home
olaf said that a bear wa dead answer steinar hesit
ragnar who had alreadi swung himself round in hi quick fashion spoke
back over hi shoulder
isnt that enough for you do you want to hunt a skull or the raven
sit on it or is thi perchanc on of olaf riddl if so i am
too cold to guess riddl just now
yet i think there is on for you to guess brother i said gentli
and it is where is the live bear hide cant you see that there
were two bear on that icehead and that on ha kill and eaten the
other
how do you know that ask ragnar
becaus i saw the slot of the second as we pass the birch wood
yonder it ha a split claw on the left forefoot and the other ar all
worn by the ic
then why in odin name did you not sai so befor exclaim ragnar
angrili
now i wa asham to confess that i had been dream so i answer at
hazard
becaus i wish to look upon the sea and the float ic see what
wondrou colour thei take in thi light
when he heard thi steinar burst out laugh till tear came into hi
blue ey and hi broad shoulder shook but ragnar who care noth
for sceneri or sunset did not laugh on the contrari as wa usual
with him when vex he lost hi temper and swore by the more evil of
the god then he turn on me and said
why not tell the truth at onc olaf you ar afraid of thi beast and
that why you let us come on here when you knew it wa in the wood you
hope that befor we got back there it would be too dark to hunt
at thi taunt i flush and grip the shaft of my long hunt spear
for among us northmen to be told that he wa afraid of anyth wa a
deadli insult to a man
if you were not my brother i began then check myself for i wa
by natur easytemp and went on it is true ragnar i am not so
fond of hunt as you ar still i think that there will be time to
fight thi bear and kill or be kill by it befor it grow dark and
if not i will return alon tomorrow morn
then i pull my hors round and rode ahead as i went my ear be
veri quick i heard the other two talk togeth at least i suppos
that i heard them at ani rate i know what thei said although
strang enough noth at all come back to me of their tale of an
attack upon a ship or of what then i did or did not do
it is not wise to jeer at olaf said steinar for when he is stung
with word he doe mad thing dont you rememb what happen when
your father call him nidder last year becaus olaf said it wa
not just to attack the ship of those british men who had been driven to
our coast by weather mean us no harm
ay answer ragnar he leapt among them all alon as soon as our
boat touch her side and fell the steersman then the british men
shout out that thei would not kill so brave a lad and threw him into
the sea it cost us that ship sinc by the time we had pick him up
she had put about and hoist her larg sail oh olaf is brave enough
we all know that still he ought to have been born a woman or a priest
of freya who onli offer flower also he know my tongu and bear no
malic
prai that we get him home safe said steinar uneasili for if not
there will be troubl with your mother and everi other woman in the
land to sai noth of iduna the fair
iduna the fair would live through it answer ragnar with a hard
laugh but you ar right and what is more there will be troubl
among the men also especi with my father and in my own heart after
all there is but on olaf
at thi moment i held up my hand and thei stop talk
chapter ii
the slai of the bear
leap from their hors ragnar and steinar came to where i stood for
alreadi i had dismount and wa point to the ground which just here
had been swept clear of snow by the wind
i see noth said ragnar
but i do brother i answer who studi the wai of wild thing
while you think i am asleep look that moss ha been turn over for
it is frozen underneath and press up into littl mound between the
bear claw also that tini pool ha gather in the slot of the paw
it is it veri shape the other footprint do not show becaus of the
rock
then i went forward a few pace behind some bush and call out here
run the track sure enough and as i thought the brute ha a split
claw the snow mark it well bid the thrall stai with the hors and
come you
thei obei and there on the white snow which lai beyond the bush we
saw the track of the bear stamp as if in wax
a mighti beast said ragnar never have i seen it like
ay exclaim steinar but an ill place to hunt it in and he
look doubtfulli at the rough gorg cover with undergrowth that
some hundr yard farther on becam dens birch forest i think it
would be well to ride back to aar and return tomorrow morn with all
whom we can gather thi is no task for three spear
by thi time i olaf wa spring from rock to rock up the gorg
follow the bear track for my brother taunt rankl in me and i
wa determin that i should kill thi beast or die and thu show ragnar
that i fear no bear so i call back to them over my shoulder
ay go home it is wisest but i go on for i have never yet seen on
of these white icebear aliv
now it is olaf who taunt in hi turn said ragnar with a laugh then
thei both sprang after me but alwai i kept ahead of them
for the half of a mile or more thei follow me out of the scrub into
the birch forest where the snow ly on the mat bough of the
tree and especi of some fir that were mingl with the birch made
the place gloomi in that low light alwai in front of me ran the huge
slot of the bear till at length thei brought me to a littl forest
glade where some great whirl wind had torn up mani tree which had
but a poor roothold on a patch of almost soilless rock
these tree lai in confus their top which had not yet rot
be fill with frozen snow on the edg of them i paus have
lost the track then i went forward again cast wide as a hound doe
while behind came ragnar and steinar walk straight past the edg of
the glade and purpos to meet me at it head thi inde ragnar
did but steinar halt becaus of a crunch sound that caught
hi ear and then step to the right between two fallen birch to
discov it caus next moment as he told me afterward he stood
frozen for there behind the bough of on of the tree wa the huge
white bear eat some anim that it had kill the beast saw him
and mad with rage at be disturb for it wa famish after it
long journei on the floe rear itself up on it hind leg roar
till the air shook high it tower it hooklik claw outstretch
steinar tri to spring back but caught hi foot and fell well for
him wa it that he did so for otherwis the blow which the bear struck
would have crush him to a pulp the brute did not seem to understand
where he had goneat ani rate it remain uprear and beat at
the air then a doubt took it it huge paw sank until it sat like
a beg dog snif the wind at thi moment ragnar came back
shout and hurl hi spear it stuck in the beast chest and hung
there the bear began to feel for it with it paw and catch the
shaft lift it to it mouth and champ it thu drag the steel
from it hide
then it bethought it of steinar and sink down discov him and
tore at the birch tree under which he had crept till the splinter flew
from it trunk just then i reach it have seen all by now the bear
had it teeth fix in steinar shoulder or rather in hi leathern
garment and wa drag him from under the tree when it saw me it
rear itself up again lift steinar and hold him to it breast
with on paw i went mad at the sight and charg it drive my spear
deep into it throat with it other paw it struck the weapon from my
hand shiver the shaft there it stood tower over us like a white
pillar and roar with pain and furi steinar still press against it
ragnar and i helpless
he sped gasp ragnar
i thought for a flash of time andoh well do i rememb that moment
the huge beast foam at the jaw and steinar held to it breast as a
littl girl hold a doll the still snowladen tree on the top of on
of which sat a small bird spread it tail in jerk the red light
of even and about us the great silenc of the sky abov and of the
lone forest beneath it all come back to mei can see it now quit
clearli ye even the bird flit to anoth twig and there again
spread it tail to some invis mate then i made up my mind what
to do
not yet i cri keep it in plai and draw my short and heavi
sword i plung through the birch bough to get behind the bear ragnar
understood he threw hi cap into the brute face and then after it
had growl at him awhil just as it drop it great jaw to crunch
steinar he found a bough and thrust it between them
by now i wa behind the bear and smite at it right leg below the
knee sever the tendon down it came still hug steinar i smote
again with all my strength and cut into it spine abov the tail
paralys it it wa a great blow as it need to be to cleav the thick
hair and hide and my sword broke in the backbon so that like ragnar
now i wa weaponless the forepart of the bear roll about in the snow
although it after half wa still
then onc more it seem to bethink itself of steinar who lai unmov
and senseless stretch out a paw it drag him toward it champ
jaw ragnar leapt upon it back and struck at it with hi knife
therebi onli madden it the more i ran in and grasp steinar whom
the bear wa again hug to it breast see me it loos steinar
whom i drag awai and cast behind me but in the effort i slip and
fell forward the bear smote at me and it mighti forearmwel for me
that it wa not it clawsstruck me upon the side of the head and sent
me crash into a treetop to the left five pace i flew befor my
bodi touch the bough and there i lai quiet
i suppos that ragnar told me what pass after thi while i wa
senseless at least i know that the bear began to die for my spear had
pierc some arteri in it throat and all the talk which follow as
well as though i heard it with my ear it roar and roar vomit
blood and stretch out it claw after steinar as ragnar drag him
awai then it laid it head flat upon the snow and di ragnar look
at it and mutter
dead
then he walk to that top of the fallen tree in which i lai and
again mutter dead well valhalla hold no braver man than olaf the
skald
next he went to steinar and onc again exclaim dead
for so he look inde smother in the blood of the bear and with
hi garment half torn off him still as the word pass ragnar lip
he sat up rub hi ey and smile as a child doe when it awak
ar you much hurt ask ragnar
i think not he answer doubtfulli save that i feel sore and my
head swim i have had a bad dream then hi ey fell on the bear and
he ad oh i rememb now it wa no dream where is olaf
sup with odin answer ragnar and point to me
steinar rose to hi feet stagger to where i lai and stare at me
stretch there as white as the snow with a smile upon my face and in
my hand a sprai of some evergreen bush which i had grasp as i fell
did he die to save me ask steinar
ay answer ragnar and never did man walk that bridg in better
fashion you were right would that i had not mock him
would that i had di and not he said steinar with a sob it is
born in upon my heart that it were better i had di
then that mai well be for the heart doe not lie at such a time also
it is true that he wa worth both of us there wa someth more in him
than there is in us steinar come lift him to my back and if you ar
strong enough go on to the hors and bid the thrall bring on of them
i follow
thu end the fight with the great white bear
some four hour later in the midst of a rage storm of wind and rain
i wa brought at last to the bridg that span the moat of the hall of
aar laid like a corps across the back of on of the hors thei had
been search for us at aar but in that dark had found noth
onli at the head of the bridg wa freydisa a torch in her hand she
glanc at me by the light of the torch
as my heart foretold so it is she said bring him in then turn
and ran to the hous

great fire of turf and wood burn at the head of the hall and laid me
on a tabl

beat of my heart

near the fire that warmth might come back to me but freydisa would not
suffer them to give me anyth save a littl hot milk which she pour
down my throat
for three dai i lai like on dead inde all save my mother held
freydisa wrong and thought that i wa dead but on the fourth dai i
open my ey and took food and after that fell into a natur
sleep on the morn of the sixth dai i sat up and spoke mani wild and

escap and now is well again
let me see him with my own ey i said
so he wa brought and i look on him i am glad you live my
brother i said for know in thi long sleep of mine i have dream
that you were dead and i stretch out my wast arm toward him for
i love steinar better than ani other man
he came and kiss me on the brow sai
ay thank to you olaf i live to be your brother and your thrall
till the end
my brother alwai not my thrall i mutter for i wa grow tire
then i went to sleep again
three dai later when my strength began to return i sent for steinar
and said
brother iduna the fair whom you have never seen my betroth must
wonder how it fare with me for the tale of thi hurt of mine will have
reach lesso now as there ar reason why ragnar cannot go and as
i would send no mean man i prai you to do me a favour it is that you
will take a boat and sail to lesso carri with you as a present from
me to athalbrand daughter the skin of that white bear which i trust
will serv her and me as a bedcov in winter for mani a year to
come tell her thank be to the god and to the skill of freydisa my
nurs i live who all thought must die and that i trust to be strong
and well for our marriag at the spring feast which draw on sai also
that through all my sick i have dream of none but her as i trust
that sometim she mai have dream of me
ay ill go answer steinar fast as hors leg and sail can
carri me ad with hi pleasant laugh long have i desir to see
thi iduna of your and to learn whether she is as beauti as you
sai also what it is in her that ragnar hate
be care that you do not find her too beauti broke in freydisa
who as ever wa at my side
how can i if she is for olaf answer steinar smile as he left
the place to make readi for hi journei to lesso
what did you mean by those word freydisa i ask when he wa gone
littl or much she repli shrug her shoulder iduna is
love is she not and steinar is handsom is he not and of an ag
when man seek woman and what is brotherhood when man seek woman and
woman beguil man
peac to your riddl freydisa you forget that iduna is my betroth
and that steinar wa foster with me why id trust them for a week at
sea alon
doubtless olaf be young and foolish as you ar also that is your
natur now here is the broth drink it and i whom some call a wise
woman and other a witch sai that tomorrow you mai rise from thi bed
and sit in the sun if there is ani
freydisa i said when i had swallow the broth why do folk call you
a witch
i think becaus i am a littl less of a fool than other women olaf
also becaus it ha not pleas me to marri as it is held natur that
all women should do if thei have the chanc
why ar you wiser and why have you not marri freydisa
i am wiser becaus i have question thing more than most and to
those who question answer come at last and i am not marri becaus
anoth woman took the onli man i want befor i met him that wa my
bad luck still it taught me a great lesson name how to wait and
meanwhil to acquir understand
what understand have you acquir freydisa for instanc doe it
tell you that our god of wood and stone ar true god which rule the
world or ar thei but wood and stone as sometim i have thought
then think no more olaf for such thought ar danger if leif
your uncl odin high priest heard them what might he not sai or do
rememb that whether the god live or no certainli the priest live
and on the god and if the god went where would the priest be also
as regard these godswel whatev thei mai or mai not be at least
thei ar the voic that in our dai speak to us from that land whenc we
came and whither we go the world ha known million of dai and each
dai ha it godor it voiceand all the voic speak truth to those
who can hear them meanwhil you ar a fool to have sent steinar
bear your gift to iduna or perhap you ar veri wise i cannot sai
as yet when i learn i will tell you
then again she shrug her shoulder and left me wonder what she
meant by her dark sai i can see her go now a wooden bowl in her
hand and in it a horn spoon of which the handl wa crack longwai
and thu in my mind end all the scene of my sick after the slai
of the white bear
the next thing that i rememb is the come of the men of agger thi
cannot have been veri long after steinar went to lesso for he had not
yet return be still weak from my great ill i wa seat
in the sun in the shelter of the hous wrap up in a cloak of
deerskinsfor the northern wind blew bitter by me stood my father who
wa in a happi mood now he knew that i should live and be strong again
steinar should be back by now i said to him i trust that he ha
come by no ill
oh no answer my father carelessli for seven dai the wind ha
been high and doubtless athalbrand fear to let him sail from lesso
or perhap steinar find athalbrand hall a pleasant place to bide
in suggest ragnar who had join us a spear in hi hand for he
had come in from hunt there ar good drink and bright ey there
i wa about to answer sharpli sinc ragnar stung me with hi bitter
talk of steinar of whom i knew him to be somewhat jealou becaus he
thought i love my fosterbroth more than i did him my brother just
then howev three men appear through tree that grew about the
hall and came toward the bridg whereon ragnar great wolfhound
know them for stranger set up a furiou bai and sprang forward
to tear them by the time the beast were caught and quell these men
ag person of presenc had cross the bridg and were greet us

burst into a loud laugh then put hi arm through mine he led me
into the hall sai
thi wind is over cold for you olaf nai troubl not about iduna
steinar lord of agger will care for her i think
that night there wa a feast at aar and i sat at it with iduna by
my side beauti she wa inde in her garment of blue over which
stream her yellow hair bright as the gold ring that tinkl on her
round arm she wa kind to me also and bade me tell her the stori of
the slai of the bear which i did as best i could though afterward
ragnar told it otherwis and more fulli onli steinar said littl or
noth for he seem to be lost in dream
i thought that thi wa becaus he felt sad at the new of the death of
hi father and brethren sinc although he had never known them blood
still call to blood and so i believ did most there present at ani
rate my father and mother tri to cheer him and in the end bade the men
of agger draw near to tell him the tale of hi heritag
thei obei and set out all their case of which the sum wa that
steinar must now be on of the wealthiest and most power men of the
northern land
it seem that we should all take off our cap to you young lord said
athalbrand when he heard thi tale of rule and rich why did you not
ask me for my fair daughter he ad with a halfdrunken laugh for
all the liquor he had swallow had got a hold of hi brain recov
himself he went on it is my will thorvald that iduna and thi snipe
of an olaf of your should be wed as soon as possibl i sai that thei
shall be wed as soon as possibl sinc otherwis i know not what mai
happen
then hi head fell forward on the tabl and he sank to sleep
chapter iii
the wander necklac
on the morrow earli i lai awak for how could i sleep when iduna rest
beneath the same roof with meiduna who as her father had decre
wa to becom my wife sooner than i had hope i wa think how
beauti she look and how much i love her also of other thing
that were not so pleasant for instanc why did not everybodi see her
with my ey i could not hide from myself that ragnar went near to
hate her more than onc she had almost been the caus of a quarrel
between us freydisa too my nurs who love me look on her sourli
and even my mother although she tri to like her for my sake had not
yet learn to do so or thu it appear to me
when i ask her why she repli that she fear the maid wa somewhat
selfish also too fond of draw the ey of men and of the adorn
of her beauti of those who were dearest to me inde onli steinar
seem to think iduna as perfect as i did myself thi so far as it
went wa well but then steinar and i had alwai thought alik which
rob hi judgment of someth of it worth
whilst i wa ponder over these thing although it wa still so earli
that my father and athalbrand were yet in bed sleep off the fume
of the liquor thei had drunk i heard steinar himself talk to the
messeng from agger in the hall thei ask him humbl whether he
would be pleas to return with them that dai and take possess of
hi inherit sinc thei must get back forthwith to agger with their
tide he repli that if thei would send some or come themselv to
escort him on the tenth dai from that on which thei spoke he would go
to agger with them but that until then he could not do so
ten dai in ten dai who know what mai happen said their spokesman
such a heritag as your will not lack for claimant lord especi
as hakon ha left nephew behind him
i know not what will or will not happen answer steinar but until
then i cannot come go now i prai you if you must and bear my word
and greet to the men of agger whom soon i hope to meet myself
so thei went as i thought heavili enough a while afterward my father
rose and came into the hall where from my bed i could see steinar
seat on a stool by the fire brood he ask where the men of agger
were and steinar told him what he had done
ar you mad steinar he ask that you have sent them awai with
such an answer why did you not consult me first
becaus you were asleep fosterfath and the messeng said thei
must catch the tide also i could not leav aar until i had seen olaf
and iduna marri
iduna and olaf can marri without your help it take two to make a
marriag not three i see well that you ow love and loyalti to olaf
who is your fosterbroth and save your life but you ow someth
to yourself also i prai odin that thi folli mai not have cost you your
lordship fortun is a wench who will not bear slight
i know it answer steinar and there wa someth strang in hi
voic believ me i do not slight fortun i follow her in my own
fashion
then it is a mad fashion grumbl my father and walk awai
it come back to me that it wa some dai after thi that i saw the
ghost of the wander stand on hi grave mound it happen thu
on a certain afternoon i had been ride alon with iduna which wa
a great joi to me though i would sooner have walk for then i could
have held her hand and perhap if she had suffer it kiss her i
had recit to her a poem which i had made compar her to the goddess
iduna the wife of bragi she who guard the appl of immort youth
whereof the god must eat or die she whose garment wa the spring
woven of the flower that she put on when she escap from winter
giant grasp i think that it wa a veri good poem of it own sort but
iduna seem to have small tast for poetri and to know littl of the
love goddess and her appl although she smile sweetli and thank
me for my vers
then she began to talk of other matter especi of how after we
were wed her father wish to make war upon anoth chieftain and to
seiz hi land she said that it wa for thi reason that he had been
so anxiou to form an allianc with my father thorvald as such an
allianc would make him sure of victori befor that time she told me
that he athalbrand had purpos to marri her to anoth lord for thi
veri reason but unhappili thi lord had been kill in battl
nai happili for us iduna i said
perhap she answer with a sigh who know at ani rate your hous
will be abl to give us more ship and men than he who is dead could
have done
yet i love peac not war i broke in i who hate the slai of
those who have never harm me and do not seek to die on the sword
of men whom i have no desir to harm of what good is war when on ha
enough i would be no widowmak iduna nor do i wish that other
should make you a widow
iduna look at me with her steadi blue ey
you talk strang olaf she said and were it not known to be
otherwis some might hold that you ar a coward yet it wa no coward
who leapt alon on board the battl ship or who slew the great white
bear to save steinar life i do not understand you olaf you who have
doubt as to the kill of men how doe a man grow great except upon
the blood of other it is that which fat him how doe the wolf live
how doe the kite live how doe odin fill valhalla by death alwai by
death
i cannot answer you i said yet i hold that somewher there is an
answer which i do not know sinc wrong can never be the right
then as she did not seem to understand i began to talk of other
thing but from that moment i felt as though a veil swung between me
and iduna her beauti held my flesh but some other part in me turn
awai from her we were differ
when we reach the hall we met steinar who wa linger near the
door he ran forward and help iduna to dismount then said
olaf i know that you must not overtir yourself as yet but your ladi
ha told me that she desir to see the sunset from odin mount have i
your leav to take her there
i do not yet need olaf leav to walk abroad though some few dai
henc it mai be differ broke in iduna with a merri laugh befor i
could answer come lord steinar let us go and see thi sunset whereof
you talk so much
ye go i said onli do not stai too long for i think a storm come
up but who is that ha taught steinar to love sunset
so thei went and befor thei had been gone an hour the storm broke as i
had foreseen first came wind and with it hail and after that thunder
and great dark lit up from time to time by puls lightn
steinar and iduna do not return i am afraid for them i said at last
to freydisa
then why do you not go to seek them she ask with a littl laugh
i think i will i said
if so i will come with you olaf for you still need a nurs though
for my part i hold that the lord steinar and the ladi iduna can guard
themselv as well as most folk no i am wrong i mean that the ladi
iduna can guard herself and the lord steinar now be not angri here
your cloak
so we start for i wa urg to thi foolish journei by some impuls
that i could not master there were two wai of reach odin mount
on the shorter over the rock and through the forest land the other
the longer ran across the open plain between the mani earth tomb of
the dead who had live thousand of year befor and past the great
mound in which it wa said that a warrior of long ago who wa name the
wander lai buri becaus of the dark we chose thi latter road
and present found ourselv beneath the great mass of the wander
mount now the dark wa intens and the lightn grew rare for
the hail and rain had ceas and the storm wa roll awai
my counsel is said freydisa that we wait here until the moon rise
which it should do soon when the wind ha driven awai the cloud it
will show us our path but if we go on in thi dark we shall fall
into some pit it is not cold tonight and you will take no harm
no inde i answer for now i am as strong again as ever i wa
so we stai till the lightn flash for the last time show us
a man and a woman stand quit close to us although we had not heard
them becaus of the wind thei were steinar and iduna talk togeth
eagerli with their face veri near to each other at the same moment
thei saw us steinar said noth for he seem confus but iduna ran
to us and said
thank be to the god who send you olaf the great storm caught us at
odin templ where we were forc to shelter then fear that you
would grow frighten we start and lost our wai
is it so i answer sure steinar would have known thi road even
in the dark but what matter sinc i have found you
ay he knew as soon as we saw thi grave mound but steinar wa
tell me that some ghost haunt it and i beg him to stai awhil
sinc there is noth i desir so much as to see a ghost who believ
littl in such thing so he stai though he sai he fear the dead
more than the live freydisa thei tell me that you ar veri wise
cannot you show me thi ghost
the spirit doe not ask my leav to appear ladi answer freydisa
in her quiet voic still at time it doe appear for i have seen it
twice so let us bide here a littl on the chanc
then she went forward a few step and began to mutter to herself
some minut later the cloud broke and the great moon wa seen ride
low down in a clear sky illumin the grave mound and all the plain
save where we stood in the shadow of the mount
do you see aught ask freydisa present if not let us be gone
for when the wander come at all it is at the rise of the moon
steinar and iduna answer no but i who did see someth said
look yonder among the shadow mayhap it is a wolf stir nai it is
a man look iduna
i look and find noth she answer
look again i said he reach the top of the mount and stand there
stare toward the south oh now he turn and the moonlight shine
upon hi face
you dream olaf said steinar if you do not dream tell us of the
like of thi spirit
it like i answer is that of a tall and nobl man worn as
though with year and sorrow he wear strang rich armour that
is dint and soil on hi head is a cap of mail with two long
earpiec beneath which appear hi brown hair line with grei he
hold a redcolour sword which is handl with a cross of gold he
point the sword at you steinar it is as though he were angri with
you or warn you
now when steinar heard these word he shook and groan as i
rememb afterward but of thi i took no note at the time for just
then iduna cri out
sai olaf doe the man wear a necklac i see a necklac hang in
the air abov the mount but naught els
ye iduna he wear a necklac abov hi mail how doe it appear to
you
oh beauti beauti she answer a chain of pale gold and
hang from it golden shell inlaid with blue and between them green
jewel that hold the moon
that is what i see also i said as inde i did there all is
gone
freydisa return and there wa a strang smile on her dark face for
she had heard all our talk
who sleep in that mound freydisa ask iduna
how can i tell ladi see that he wa laid there a thousand year
ago or mayhap more yet a stori true or fals remain of him that
i have heard it is that he wa a king of these part who follow a
dream to the south the dream wa of a necklac and of on who wore it
for mani year he wander and at length return again to thi place
which had been hi home wear the necklac but when he saw it shore
from the sea he fell down and hi spirit left him what happen to him
in hi wander none know for the tale is lost onli it is said that
hi peopl buri him in yonder mound still wear hi armour and the
necklac he had won there as olaf ha seen or think that he ha seen
but now he stand at moonris er troubl come to ani of hi race and
stare toward the southalwai toward the south
is the necklac yet in the mound ask iduna eagerli
without doubt ladi who would dare to touch the holi thing and bring
on him the curs of the wander and hi god and with it hi own
death no man that ever sail the sea i think
not so freydisa for i am sure i know on who would dare it for my
sake olaf if you love me bring me that necklac as a marriag gift i
tell you that have onc seen it i want it more than anyth in all
the world
did you hear what freydisa said i ask that he who wrought thi
sacrileg would bring upon himself evil and death
ye i heard but it is folli for who need fear dead bone as for the
shape you saw why it is strengthless for good or ill a shadow
drawn from what ha been by the magic moon or perchanc by freydisa
witcheri olaf olaf get me that necklac or i will never kiss you
more
that mean you will not marri me iduna
that mean i will onli marri the man who give me that necklac if you
fear the deed perhap there ar some other by whom it might be tri
now when i heard these word a sudden rage seiz me wa i to be
taunt thu by the fair woman whom i love
fear is an ill word to us to me i said sternli know iduna that
if it is put to me thu i fear noth in life or death you shall have
the necklac if it can be found in yonder earth chanc what mai to the
searcher nai no more word steinar will lead you home i must talk of
thi matter with freydisa
it wa midnight i know not on what dai sinc all these thing come
back to me in vivid scene as flash of lightn show a landscap
but ar separ from each other by dens dark freydisa and i
stood by the wander grave and at our feet lai dig tool two
lamp and tinder to light them we were set about our grim task at
dead of night for fear lest the priest should stai us also i did not
wish the peopl to know that i had done thi thing
here is work for a month i said doubtfulli look up at the great
mass of the mound
nai repli freydisa sinc i can show you the door of the grave
and perchanc the passag still stand yet will you realli enter
there
why not freydisa must i bear to be taunt by the woman i am to wed
sure it would be better to die and have done let the ghost slai me if
he will it come upon me that if so i shall be spare troubl
no bridegroom talk said freydisa howev true it mai be yet
young olaf do you take heart sinc i think that thi ghost ha no
desir for your blood i am wise in my own fashion olaf and much of
the past come to me if littl of the futur and i believ that thi
wander and you have more to do with each other than we can guess
it mai be even that thi task is appoint to you and that all these
happen which ar but begun work to an end unseen at the least
try your fortun and if you diewhi i who wa your nurs from your
mother knee love you well enough to die with you togeth well
descend to hela hall there to seek out the wander and learn hi
stori
then throw her arm about my neck she drew me to her and kiss me
on the brow
i wa not your mother olaf she went on but to be honest i would
have been could i have had my fanci though strang enough i never
felt thu toward ragnar your brother now why do you make me talk
foolish come hither and i will show you the entranc to the grave
it is where the sun first strike upon it
then she led me to the east of the mound where not more than eight or
ten feet from it base grew a patch of bush among these bush wa
a littl hollow as though at thi spot the earth had sunk in here at
her bid i began to dig and with her help work for the half of an
hour or more in silenc till at length my spade struck against a stone
it is the doorston said freydisa dig round it
so i dug till i made a hole at the edg of the stone larg enough for a
man to creep through after thi we paus to rest a while and to allow
the air within the mound to purifi
now she said if you ar not afraid we will enter
i am afraid i answer inde the terror which struck me then
return so that even as i write i feel fear of the dead man who lai
and for aught i know still li within that grave yet i ad
never will i face iduna more without the necklac if it can be found
so we struck spark on to the tinder and from them lit the two lamp
of seal oil then i crept into the hole freydisa follow me to find
myself in a narrow passag built of rough stone and roof with flat
slab of waterworn rock thi tunnel save for a littl dry soil that
had sift into it through the crack between the stone wa quit
clear we crawl along it without difficulti till we came to the tomb
chamber which wa in the centr of the mound but at a higher level
than the entranc for the passag slope upward doubtless to allow
for drainag the huge stone with which it wa line and roof over
were not less than ten feet high and set on end side by side on of
these upright stone wa that design for the door had it been in
place we could not have enter the chamber without great labour and
the help of mani men but as it chanc either it had never been set
up after the burial or thi wa done so hastili that it had fallen
we ar in luck wai said freydisa when she notic thi no
i will go first who know more of ghost than you do olaf if the
wander strike let him strike me and she clamber over the fallen
slab
present she call back sai
come all is quiet here as it should be in such a place
i follow her and slide down the end of the stonewhich i rememb
scratch my elbow and made it bleedfound myself in a littl room
about twelv feet squar in thi place there wa but on thing to be
seen what appear to be the trunk of a great oak tree some nine feet
in length and stand on it side by side two figur of bronz
under a foot in height
the coffin in which the wander li and the god he worship said
freydisa
then she took up first on and next the other of the bronz figur and
we examin them in the light of the lamp although i fear to touch
them thei were statu of a man and a woman
the man who wore a long and formal beard wa wrap in what seem
to be a shroud through an open in which appear hi hand in the
right hand wa a scourg with a handl and in the left a crook such as
a shepherd might us onli shorter on hi head wa what i took to be a
helmet a tall peak cap end in a knob have on either side of it
a stiff feather of bronz and in front abov the forehead a snake

the woman wa clad in a straight and narrow robe cut low beneath her
breast her face wa mild and beauti and in her right hand she
held a loop sceptr her hair descend in mani long plait on to her
shoulder for headdress she wore two horn support between them a
burnish disc of gold like to that of the moon when it is full
strang god i mutter
ay answer freydisa yet mayb true on to those who worship
them but we will talk of these later now for their servant
then she drop the figur into a pouch at her side and began to
examin the trunk of the oak tree of which the outer sap wood had been
turn to tinder by ag leav the heart still hard as iron
see she said point to a line about four inch from the top the
tree ha been sawn in two lengthwai and the lid laid on come help
then she took an ironshod staff which we had brought with us and
work it sharp point into the crack after which we both rest our
weight upon the staff the lid of the coffin lift quit easili for
it wa not peg down and slid of it own weight over the side of
the tree in the caviti beneath wa a form cover with a purpl cloak
stain as though by salt water freydisa lift the cloak and there
lai the wander as he had been place a thousand or more of year
befor our time as perfect as he had been in the hour of hi death for
the tannin from the newfel tree in which he wa buri had preserv
him
breathless with wonder we bent down and examin him by the light of
the lamp he wa a tall spare man to all appear of between fifti
and sixti year of ag hi face wa thin and fine he wore a short
grizzl beard hi hair so far as it could be seen beneath hi helmet
wa brown and lightli ting with grei

becom should you live to hi year yet it wa through your mother
line that aar came to your race mani gener gone for thi much is
known well studi him hard for look you now that the air ha got to
him he melt awai
melt he did inde till present there wa noth left save a skull
patch here and there with skin and hair yet i never forgot that
face inde to thi hour i see it quit clearli when at length it had
crumbl we turn to other thing know that our time in the grave
must be measur by the oil in the simpl lamp we had freydisa lift
a cloth from beneath the chin reveal a dint breastplat of rich
armour differ from ani of our dai and land and ly on it such
a necklac as we had seen upon the ghost a beauteou thing of inlaid
golden shell and emerald stone shape like beetl
take it for your iduna said freydisa sinc it is for her sake that
we break in upon thi great man rest
i seiz the preciou thing and tug at it but the chain wa stout
and would not part again i tug and now it wa the neck of the
wander that broke for the head roll from the bodi and the gold
chain came loos between the two
let us be go said freydisa as i hid awai the necklac the oil
in the lamp burn low and even i do not care to be left here in the
dark with thi mighti on whom we have rob

by which it wa girt about the bodi the leather had rot and it came
awai in my hand

down the passag befor we reach the end of it the lamp went out so
that we must finish our journei in the dark thank enough were both
of us when we found ourselv safe in the open air beneath the familiar
star
now how come it freydisa i ask when we had got our breath
again that thi wander who show himself so threateningli upon the
crest of hi grave li patient as a dead sheep within it while we rob
hi bone

futur and memori of the past
chapter iv
iduna wear the necklac
i lai sleep in my bed at aar the sword of the wander by my side
and hi necklac beneath my pillow in my sleep there came to me a veri
strang and vivid dream i dream that i wa the wander no other
man and here i who write thi histori in these modern dai will sai
that the dream wa true
onc in the far past i who afterward wa born as olaf and who am
nowwel never mind my nameliv in the shape of that man who in
olaf time wa by tradit known as the wander of that wander
life howev for some reason which i cannot explain i am abl to
recov but few memori other earlier live come back to me much more
clearli but at present the detail of thi particular exist escap
me for the purpos of the histori which i am set down thi matter
littl sinc although i know enough to be sure that the person
concern in the olaf life were for the most part the same as those
concern in the wander life their stori remain quit distinct
therefor i propos to leav that of the wander so far as i know
it untold wild and romant as it seem to have been for he must have
been a great man thi wander who in the earli ag of the northern
world drawn by the magnet of some previou egyptian incarn broke
back to those southern land with which hi inform spirit wa alreadi
so familiar and thenc won home again to the place where he wa born
onli to die in consid thi dream which olaf dream let it be
rememb then that although a thousand or mayb fifteen hundr of
our earthli year separ us from each other the wander into whose
tomb i broke at the goad of iduna and i olaf were realli the same
be cloth in differ shape of flesh
to return to my dream i olaf or rather my spirit dwell in the
wander bodi that bodi which i had just seen ly in the grave
stood at night in a great column build which i knew to be
the templ of some god at my feet lai a basin of clear water the
moonlight which wa almost as bright as that of dai show me my
reflect in the water it wa like to that of the wander as i had
seen him ly in hi oak coffin in the mound onli younger than he had
seem to be in the coffin moreov he wore the same armour that the
man in the coffin wore and at hi side hung the red crosshandl
sword there he stood in the templ alon and look across a plain
green with crop on which sat two mighti imag as high as tall pine
look to a great river on whose bank grew tree such as i had never
beheld tall straight tree surmount by a stiff crown of leav
beyond thi river lai a white flatroof citi and in it were other
great column templ
the man in whom i olaf the dane seem to dwell in my dream turn
and behind him saw a rang of nake hill of brown rock and in them the
mouth of a desol vallei where wa no green thing present he becam
awar that he wa no longer alon at hi side stood a woman she wa
a veri beauti woman unlik anyon i olaf had ever seen her shape
wa tall and slender her ey were larg dark and soft as a deer
her featur were small and straight save the mouth of which the lip
were somewhat full the face which wa darkhu like her hair and
ey wa sad but wore a sweet and haunt smile it wa much such a
face as that upon the statu of the goddess which we had found in the
wander tomb and the dress she wore beneath her cloak wa like to
the dress of the goddess she wa speak earnestli
my love my onli love she said you must begon thi veri night
inde the boat await you that shall take you down the river to the
sea all is discov my waitingladi the priestess but now ha told
me that my father the king purpos to seiz and throw you into prison
tomorrow and thereaft to put you on your trial for be belov
by a daughter of the royal blood of which as you ar a foreign man
howev nobl you mai be the punish is death moreov if you ar
condemn your doom will be my own there is but on wai in which to
save my life and that is by your flight for if you fly it ha been
whisper to me that all will be forgotten
now in my dream he who wore the wander shape reason with her
sai at length that it wa better thei both should die to live on in
the world of spirit rather than part for ever she hid her face on hi
breast and answer
i cannot die i would stai to look upon the sun not for my own sake
but becaus of our child that will be born nor can i fly with you
sinc then your boat will be stop but if you go alon the guard
will let it pass thei have their command
after thi for a while thei wept in each other arm for their heart
were broken
give me some token he murmur let me wear someth that you have
worn until my death
she open her cloak and there upon her breast hung that necklac which
had lain upon the breast of the wander in hi tomb the necklac of
gold and inlaid shell and emerald beetl onli there were two row of
shell and emerald not on on row she unclasp and clasp it again
round hi neck break the littl gold thread that bound the two
strand togeth
take thi she said and i will wear the half which is left of it
even in my grave as you also shall wear your half in life and death
now someth come upon me it is that when the sever part of thi
necklac ar onc more join togeth then we two shall meet again
upon the earth
what chanc is there that i shall return from my northern home if ever
i win so far back to thi southern land
none she answer in thi life we shall kiss no more yet there ar
other live to come or so i think and have learn through the wisdom
of my peopl begon begon er my heart break on your but never
let thi necklac of mine which wa that of those who were long befor
me lie upon anoth woman breast for if so it will bring sorrow to
the giver and to her to whom it is given no good fortun
how long must i wait befor we meet again he ask
i do not know but i think that when all that jewel onc more grow
warm abov my immor heart thi templ which thei call etern will be
but a timeeaten ruin hark the priestess call farewel you man who
have come out of the north to be my glori and my shame farewel until
the purpos of our live declar itself and the seed that we have sown
in sorrow shall blossom into an everlast flower farewel farewel
then a woman appear in the background beckon and all my dream
vanish awai yet to my mind came the thought that it wa to the ladi
who gave the necklac that death stood near rather than to him to whom
it wa given for sure death wa written in her sad and long ey
so that dream end when i olaf awok in the morn it wa to find
that alreadi everyon wa astir for i had overslept myself in the
hall were gather ragnar steinar iduna and freydisa the elder were
talk togeth elsewher on the subject of the forthcom marriag
i went to iduna to embrac her and she proffer me her cheek speak
all the while over her shoulder to ragnar
where were you last night brother that you came in near the dawn
all cover with mud ask ragnar turn hi back on iduna without
make ani answer to her word
dig in the wander grave brother as iduna challeng me to
do
now all three of them turn on me eagerli save freydisa who stood by
the fire listen and with on voic ask if i had found anyth
ay i repli i found the wander a veri noblelook man and
i began to describ him
peac to thi dead wander broke in iduna did you find the
necklac
ye i found the necklac here it is and i laid the splendid thing
upon the board
then suddenli i lost my speech sinc now for the first time i saw
that twist round the chain of it were three broken wire of gold
i rememb how in my dream i had seen the beauti woman break such
wire er she gave half of the jewel to the man in whose breast i had
seem to dwell and for a moment grew so frighten that i could sai no
more
oh exclaim iduna it is beauti beauti oh olaf i thank
you and she flung her arm about me and kiss me thi time in
earnest
then she seiz the necklac and fasten it round her throat
stai i said awak i think you had best not touch those gem
iduna i have dream that thei will bring no luck to you or to ani
woman save on
here the darkfac freydisa look up at me then drop her ey
again and stood listen
you have dream exclaim iduna i care littl what you have
dream it is for the necklac i care and not all the illluck in the
world shall stai me from the keep of it
here again freydisa look up but steinar look down
did you find aught els ask ragnar interrupt
ay brother thi and from under my cloak i produc the wander
sword
a wondrou weapon said ragnar when he had examin it though
somewhat heavi for it length and of bronz after the fashion of those
that ar buri in the grave mound it ha seen much wear also and
i should sai ha loos mani a spirit look at the gold work of the
handl truli a wondrou weapon worth all the necklac in the world
but tell us your stori
so i told them and when i came to the imag that we had found stand
on the coffin iduna who wa pai littl heed stop from her
fondl of the necklac and ask where thei were
freydisa ha them i answer show them the wander god
freydisa
so freydisa wa with you wa she said iduna
then she glanc at the god laugh a littl at their fashion and
raiment and again fell to finger the necklac which wa more to her
than ani god
afterward freydisa ask me what wa the dream of which i had spoken
and i told it to her everi word
it is a strang stori said freydisa what do you make of it olaf
noth save that it wa a dream and yet those three broken wire
that ar twist round the chain which i had never note till i saw the
necklac in iduna hand thei fit well with my dream
ay olaf and the dream fit well with other thing have you ever
heard olaf that there ar those who sai that men live more than onc
upon thi earth
no i answer laugh yet why should thei not do so as thei live
at all if so perhap i am that wander in whose bodi i seem to be
onli then i am sure that the ladi with the golden shell wa not iduna
and again i laugh
no olaf she wa not iduna though perchanc there wa an iduna all
the same tell me did you see aught of that priestess who wa with the
ladi
onli that she wa tall and dark on of middl ag but why wast word
on thi midnight mad yet that royal woman haunt me i would that
i could see her again if onli in a dream also freydisa i would
that iduna had not taken the necklac i fear lest it should bring
misfortun where is she now i will tell her again
wander with steinar i think and wear the necklac oh olaf
like you i fear it will bring woe i cannot read your dreama yet
it wa the dai befor that of my marriag i see them move about
the shape of all those longforgotten men and women arrai in their
bravest garment and rude ornament of gold and silver for a great
compani had been bidden mani of whom came from far i see my uncl
leif the darkbrow priest of odin pass between the hall and the
templ where on the morrow he must celebr the marriag rite in such
a fashion as would do honour to the god i see iduna athalbrand and
steinar talk togeth apart i see myself watch all thi life
and stir like on who is maze and i know that sinc i had enter
the wander grave all thing had seem unreal to me iduna whom
i love wa about to becom my wife and yet between me and iduna
continu wa thrust a vision of the woman of my dream at time i
thought that the blow from the bear paw had hurt my brain that i must
be go mad i prai to the god that thi might not be so and when
my prayer avail me noth i sought the counsel of freydisa
she listen to my stori then said briefli
let be thing will go as thei ar fate you ar no madder than the
rest of men i can sai no more
it wa the custom of that time and land that if possibl the wife to
be should not pass the night befor her marriag under the same roof as
her futur husband therefor athalbrand whose mood had been strang
of late went with iduna to sleep in hi beach ship at my request
steinar went with them in order that he might see that thei were
brought back in good time in the morn
you will not fail me in thi steinar i said clasp hi hand
he tri to answer someth but the word seem to choke in hi
throat and he turn awai leav them unspoken
why i exclaim on might think you were go to be marri not
i
ay broke in iduna hurriedli the truth is that steinar is jealou
of me how is it that you can make us all love you so much olaf
would that i were more worthi of your love i answer smile as
in year to come i hope to show myself
athalbrand who wa watch tug at hi fork beard and mutter
someth that sound like an oath then he rode off kick hi hors
savag and not note my outstretch hand or so it seem of thi
howev i took littl heed for i wa engag in kiss iduna in
farewel
be not sad she said as she kiss me back on the lip rememb
that we part for the last time again she kiss me and went laugh
happili
the morn came all wa prepar from far and near the guest were
gather wait to do honour to the marriag feast even some of the
men of agger were there who had come to pai homag to their new lord
the spring sun shone brightli as it should upon a marriag morn and
without the door the trumpet blew blast with their curv horn in
the templ the altar of odin wa decor with flower and by it also
decor with flower the offer await sacrific my mother in
her finest robe the same in truth in which she herself had been wed
stood by the door of the hall which wa clear of kine and set with
tabl give and return greet her arm wa round me who as
bridegroom wa cloth in new garment of woven wool through which ran
a purpl streak the best that could be made in all the land ragnar
came up
thei should be here he said the hour is over past
doubtless the fair bride ha been long in deck herself answer my
father look at the sun she will come present
still time went on and the compani began to murmur while a strang
cold fear seem to grip my heart at length a man wa seen ride
toward the hall and on cri
at last here come the herald
anoth answer for a messeng of love he ride slowli and sadli
and a silenc fell on all that heard him
the man a stranger to us arriv and said
i have a messag for the lord thorvald from the lord athalbrand which
i wa charg to deliv at thi hour neither befor nor after it is
that he sail for lesso at the rise of the moon last night there
purpos to celebr the marriag of hi daughter the ladi iduna
with steinar lord of agger and is therefor griev that he and the
ladi iduna cannot be present at your feast thi dai
now when i heard these word i felt as though a spear had been thrust
through me steinar oh sure not with my brother steinar i gasp
and stagger against the doorpost where i stood like on who ha been
struck helpless
ragnar sprang at the messeng and drag him from hi hors would
have kill him had not some stai hi hand my father thorvald
remain silent but hi halfbroth the darkbrow priest of odin
lift hi hand to heaven and call down the curs of odin upon the
trothbreak the compani drew sword and shout for vengeanc
demand to be led against the fals athalbrand at length my father
call for silenc
athalbrand is a man without shame he said steinar is a viper whom
i have nurs in my breast a viper that ha bitten the hand which save
him from death ay you men of agger you have a viper for your lord
iduna is a lightoflov upon whom all honest women should spit who ha
broken her oath and sold herself for steinar wealth and rule i swear
by thor that with your help my friend and neighbour i will be
aveng upon all three of these but for such vengeanc prepar
must be made sinc athalbrand and steinar ar strong moreov thei
lie in an island and can onli be attack by sea further there is
no hast sinc the mischief is done and by now steinar the snake and
iduna the lightoflov will have drunk their marriagecup come eat
my friend and not too sadli see that if my hous ha suffer
shame it ha escap wors shame that of welcom a fals woman as
a bride of on of us doubtless when hi bitter is past olaf my
son will find a better wife
so thei sat down and at the marriag feast onli the seat of the bride
and bridegroom were empti for i could not take part in that feast but
went alon to my sleepingplac and drew the curtain my mother also
wa so overcom that she depart to her own chamber alon i sat upon
my bed and listen to the sound of that marriag feast which more
resembl such a on as is given at funer when it wa finish i
heard my father and ragnar and the head men and chief of the compani
take counsel togeth after which all depart to their home
so soon as thei were gone freydisa came to me bring food and drink
i am a shame man freydisa i said and can no longer stai in thi
land where i have been made on for children to mock at
it is not you who ar shame answer freydisa hotli it is steinar
and that and she us a harsh word of iduna oh i saw it come
and yet i dare not warn you i fear lest i might be wrong and put
doubt into your heart against your fosterbroth and your wife without
caus mai odin destroi them both
speak not so roughli freydisa i said ragnar wa right about iduna
her beauti never blind him as it did me and he read her truli well
she did but follow her natur and as for steinar she fool him as she
ha the power to do by ani man save ragnar doubtless he will repent
bitterli er all is done also i think that necklac from the grave is
an evil magic
it is like you olaf to find excus even for sin that cannot be
forgiven not but what i hold with you that steinar ha been led awai
against hi will for i read it in hi face well hi life must pai the
price of it for sure he shall bleed on odin altar now be a man
come out and face your troubl you ar not the first that a woman ha
fool nor will you be the last forget love and dream of vengeanc
i cannot forget love and i do not wish for vengeanc especi
against steinar who is my fosterbroth i answer wearili
chapter v
the battl on the sea
on the morrow thorvald my father sent messeng to the head men of
agger tell them of all that he and hi hous had suffer at the
hand of steinar whereof those of their folk who had been present at
the feast could bear wit he ad that if thei stood by steinar in
hi wicked and treacheri thenceforward he and the men of the north
would be their foe and work them mischief by land and sea
in due cours these messeng return with the tale that the head men
of agger had met togeth and depos steinar from hi lordship over
them elect anoth man a nephew of steinar father also thei sent
a present of gold ring in aton for the wrong which had been done
to the hous of thorvald by on of their blood and prai that thorvald
and the northern men would bear them no ill will for that in which thei
were blameless
cheer by thi answer which halv the number of their foe
my father thorvald of aar and those overmen of whom he wa the
highlord began to make their prepar to attack athalbrand on hi
island of lesso of all these thing athalbrand learn by hi spi
and later when the warship were be prepar and man two
messeng came from him old men of reput and demand to see my
father thi wa the substanc of hi messag which wa deliv in my
hear
that he athalbrand wa littl to blame for what had happen which
wa due to the mad passion of two young peopl who had blind and
misl him that no marriag had taken place between steinar and hi
daughter iduna as he wa prepar and abl to prove sinc he had
refus to allow ani such marriag that therefor he wa readi to
outlaw steinar who onli dwelt with him as an unwelcom guest and to
return hi daughter iduna to me olaf and with her a fine in gold
ring as compens for the wrong done of which the amount wa to be
ascertain by judg to be agre upon
my father entertain the messeng but would give them no answer till
he had summon a council of the underlord who stood with him in
thi busi at that council where i wa present some said that the
insult could onli be wash out with blood at length i wa call upon
to speak as the man most concern while all listen i rose and said
these ar my word after what ha chanc not for all the wealth in
denmark would i take iduna the fair to be my wife let her stai with
steinar whom she ha chosen still i do not wish to caus the blood of
innoc men to be spent becaus of my privat wrong neither do i wish
to wreak vengeanc upon steinar who for mani year wa my brother and
who ha been led awai by a woman as mai chanc to ani on of us and
ha chanc to mani therefor i sai that my father should accept
athalbrand fine in satisfact of the insult to our hous and let
all thi matter be forgotten as for myself i purpos to leav my home
where i have been put to shame and to seek my fortun in other land
now the most of those present thought thi a wise sai and were readi
to abid by it yet unluckili enough it wa made of no account by what
had slip from my lip at it end although mani held me strang and
fei all men love me becaus i had a kind heart and gentl also
becaus of the wrong that i had suffer and for someth which thei
saw in me which thei believ would on dai make of me a great skald
and a wise leader when she heard me announc thu publicli that i wa
determin to leav them thora my mother whisper in the ear of
thorvald my father and ragnar and other also said to each other that
thi might not be it wa ragnar the headlong who sprang up and spoke
the first
is my brother to be driven from us and hi home like a thrall caught
in theft becaus a traitor and a fals woman have put him to shame he
said i sai that i ask athalbrand blood to wash awai that stain
not hi gold and that if need be i will seek it alon and die upon hi
spear also i sai that if olaf my brother turn hi back upon thi
vengeanc i name him nidder
no man shall name me that i said flush and least of all
ragnar
so amidst shout for there had been long peac in the land and all
the fight men sigh for battl it wa agre that war should be
declar on athalbrand those present pledg themselv and their
depend to follow it to the end
go back to the trothbreak athalbrand said my father to the
messeng tell him that we will not accept hi fine of gold who come
to take all hi wealth and with it hi land and hi life tell him also
that the young lord olaf refus hi daughter iduna sinc it ha
not been the fashion of our hous to wed with drab tell steinar the
womanthief that he would do well to slai himself or to be sure that
he is kill in battl sinc if we take him live he shall be cast
into a pit of viper or sacrif to odin the god of honour begon
we go answer the spokesman of the messeng yet befor we go
thorvald we would sai to you that you and your folk ar mad some wrong
ha been done to your son though perhap not so much as you mai think
for that wrong full aton ha been offer and with it the hand of
friendship on which you spit know then that the mighti lord athalbrand
doe not fear war sinc for everi man you can gather he number two
all pledg to him until the death also he ha consult the oracl
and it answer is that if you fight with him but on of your hous will
be left live
begon thunder my father lest present you should stai here
dead
so thei went
that dai my heart wa veri heavi and i sought freydisa to take counsel
with her
troubl hover over me like a croak raven i said i do not like
thi war for a woman who is worth noth although she ha hurt me
sore i fear the futur that it mai prove even wors than the past
ha been
then come to learn it olaf for what is known need no more be fear
i am not so sure of that i said but how can the futur be learn
through the voic of the god olaf am i not on of odin virgin
who know someth of the mysteri yonder in hi templ mayhap he will
speak through me if you dare to listen
ay i dare i should like to hear the god speak true word or fals
then come and hear them olaf
so we went up to the templ and freydisa who had the right of entri
unlock it door we pass in and lit a lamp in front of the seat
wooden imag of odin that for unnumb gener had rest there
behind the altar i stood by the altar and freydisa crouch herself
befor the imag her forehead laid upon it feet and mutter rune
after a while she grew silent and fear took hold of me the place wa
larg and the feebl light of the lamp scarc reach to the arch
roof all about me were great formless shadow i felt that there were
two world on of the flesh and on of the spirit and that i stood
between the two freydisa seem to go to sleep i could no longer hear
her breath then she sigh heavili and turn her head and by the
light of the lamp i note that her face wa white and ghastli
what do you seek her lip ask for i saw them move yet the voic
that issu from them wa not her own voic but that of a deepthroat
man who spoke with a strang accent
next came the answer in the voic of freydisa
i your virgin seek to know the fate of him who stand by the altar
on whom i love
for a while there wa quiet then the first voic spoke still through
the lip of freydisa of thi i wa sure for those of the statu
remain immov it wa what it had alwai beena thing of wood
olaf the son of thorvald said the deep voic is an enemi of us the
god as wa hi forefath whose grave he rob as hi forefath
fate wa so shall hi be for in both of them dwell the same spirit
he shall worship that which is upon the hilt of the sword he stole from
the dead and in thi sign shall conquer sinc it prevail against us
and make our curs of none effect great sorrow shall he tast and
great joi he shall throw awai a sceptr for a woman kiss and yet
gain a greater sceptr olaf whom we curs shall be olaf the bless
yet in the end shall we prevail against hi flesh and that of those who
cling to him preach that which is upon the sword but not with the
sword among whom thou shalt be number womanth and anoth who
hast done him wrong
the voic di awai and wa follow by a silenc so deep that at
length i could bear it no more
ask of the war i said and of what shall happen
it is too late answer the voic of freydisa i sought to know of
you olaf and you alon and now the spirit ha left me
then came anoth long silenc after which freydisa sigh thrice and
awok we went out of the templ i bear the lamp and she rest on
my arm near the door i turn and look back and it seem to me that
the imag of the god glare upon me wrathfulli
what ha chanc ask freydisa when we stood beneath the light of
the friendli star i know noth my mind is a black
i told her word for word when i had finish she said
give me the wander sword
i gave it to her and she held it against the sky by the nake blade
the hilt is a cross she said but how can a man worship a cross and
preach it and conquer therebi i cannot interpret thi rede yet i do
not doubt but that it shall all come true and that you olaf and i ar
doom to be join in the same fate whatev it mai be and with us
some other who ha wrong you steinar perchanc or iduna herself
well of thi at least i am glad for if i have love the father i
think that i love the son still more though otherwis and lean
forward she kiss me solemnli upon the brow
after freydisa and i had sought the oracl of odin three long ship
of war sail by the light of the moon from fladstrand for athalbrand
isl of lesso i do not know when we sail but in my mind i can
still see those ship creep out to sea in command of the first wa
thorvald my father of the second ragnar my brother and of the third
myself olaf and on each of these ship were fifti men all of them
stout fighter
the part with thora my mother had been sad for her heart forebod
ill of thi war and her face could not hide what her heart told her
inde she wept bitterli and curs the name of iduna the fair who
had brought thi troubl on her hous freydisa wa sad also yet
watch her opportun she glide up to me just befor i embark and
whisper to me
be of good cheer for you will return whoever is left behind
it will give me littl comfort to return if certain other ar left
behind i answer oh that the folk had hearken to me and made
peac
too late to talk of that now said freydisa and we part
thi wa our plan to sail for lesso by the moonlight and when the moon
went down to creep silent toward the shore of the island then just
at the first break of dawn we propos to beach the ship on a sandi
strand we knew and rush to attack athalbrand hall which we hope to
carri befor men were well awak it wa a bold scheme and on full
of danger yet we trust that it veri bold would caus it
to succe especi as we had put it about that ow to the
unreadi of our ship no attack would be made until the come of
the next moon
doubtless all might have gone well with us but for a strang chanc as
it happen athalbrand a brave and skil captain who from hi youth
had seen much war by sea and land had a design of hi own which
brought our to noth it wa that he and hi peopl should sail to
fladstrand burn the ship of thorvald my father that he knew were
fit out upon the beach which he hope to find unguard or at most
onli watch by a few men and then return to lesso befor he could
be fallen upon by ill luck he had chosen thi veri night for hi
enterpris so it came about that just as the moon wa sink our
watchmen caught sight of four other ship which by the shield that
hung over their bulwark thei knew must be vessel of war glide
toward them over the quiet sea
athalbrand come to meet us cri on and in a minut everi man
wa look to hi arm there wa no time for plan sinc in that low
light and mist the vessel were almost bow to bow befor we saw each
other my father ship ran in between two of athalbrand that were
sail abreast while mine and that of ragnar found themselv almost
alongsid of the other on both side the sail were let down for none
had ani thought of flight some rush to the oar and got enough of
them out to work the ship other ran to the grappl iron and the
rest began to shoot with their bow befor on could count two hundr
from the time of sight the war cry of valhalla valhalla victori
or valhalla broke upon the silenc of the night and the battl had
begun
it wa a veri fierc battl and on that the gather dark made
more grim each ship fought without heed to the other for as the
frai went on thei drift apart grappl to their foe my father
thorvald vessel fare the worst sinc it had an enemi on either
bulwark he board on and clear it lose mani men then the crew
of the other rush on to him as he regain hi own ship the end of it
wa that my father and all hi folk were kill but onli after thei had
slain the most of their foe for thei di fight veri brave
between ragnar ship and that of athalbrand himself the frai wa more
even ragnar board athalbrand and wa driven back athalbrand board
ragnar and wa driven back then for the second time ragnar board
athalbrand with those men who were left to him in the narrow waist of
athalbrand ship a mighti battl wa fought and here at last ragnar
and athalbrand found themselv face to face
thei hack at each other with their ax till at length ragnar with
a fear blow drove in athalbrand helmet and clove hi skull in two
so that he di but even as he fell a man it mai have been friend
or foe for the moon wa sink and the dark grew dens thrust a
spear into ragnar back and he wa carri dy to hi own vessel
by those who remain to him
then that fight ceas for all athalbrand peopl were dead or wound
to the death meanwhil on the right i wa fight the ship that
wa command by steinar for it wa fate that we two should be thrown
togeth here also the struggl wa desper steinar and hi compani
board at the prow but i and my men charg up both board drove
them back again in that charg it is true that i olaf fight madli
as wa my wont when rous kill three of the lesso folk with the
wander sword still i see them fall on by on follow by six
of my peopl i sprang on to the rais prow of steinar ship just
then the grapnel part and there we were left defend ourselv
as best we could my mate got their oar and onc more brought our
boat alongsid grappl thei could not becaus the iron were lost
therefor in obedi to the order which i shout to them from the
high prow of the enemi ship thei began to hurl their ballast stone
into her and thu stove out her bottom so that in the end she fill
and sank
even while she wa down the frai went on nearli all my peopl were
down inde but two remain to me when steinar not know who i wa
rush up and have lost hi sword grip me round the middl
we wrestl but steinar who wa the stronger forc me back to the
bulwark and so overboard into the sea we went togeth just as
the ship sank draw us down after her when we rose steinar wa
senseless but still cling to me as i caught a rope that wa thrown
to me with my right hand to which the wander sword wa hang by a
leathern loop
the end of it wa that i and the senseless steinar were both drawn back
to my own ship just as the dark close in
an hour later came the dawn show a sad sight my father thorvald
ship and on of athalbrand lai helpless for all or nearli all their
crew were dead while the other had drift off and wa now half a mile
awai
ragnar ship wa still grappl to it foe my own wa perhap in the
best case for here over twenti men were left unhurt and anoth ten
whose wound were light the rest were dead or dy
i sat on a bench in the waist of the ship and at my feet lai the man
who had been drag from the sea with me i thought that thi man wa
dead till the first red rai of dawn lit upon hi face whereon he sat
up and i saw that he wa steinar
thu we meet again my brother i said in a quiet voic well
steinar look upon your work and i point to the dead and dy and
to the ship around whenc came the sound of groan
steinar stare at me and ask in a thick voic
wa it with you olaf that i fell into the sea
even so steinar
i knew it not in the dark olaf if i had known never would i have
lift sword against you
what did that matter steinar when you had alreadi pierc my heart
though not with a sword
at these word steinar moan aloud then said
for the second time you have save my life
ay steinar but who know whether i can do so for a third time yet
take comfort for if i mai i will for thu shall i be best aveng
a white vengeanc said steinar oh thi is not to be born and
draw a knife he wore at hi girdl he strove to kill himself
but i who wa watch snatch it awai then gave an order
bind thi man and keep him safe also bring him drink and a cloak to
cover him
best kill the dog grumbl the captain to whom i spoke
i kill that on who lai a finger on him i repli
someon whisper into the captain ear whereon he nod and laugh
savag
ah he exclaim i am a thickhead i had forgotten odin and hi
sacrific ye ye well keep the traitor safe
so thei bound steinar to on of the bench and gave him al and cover
him with a bloodstain cloak taken from a dead man
i also drank of the al and drew a cloak about me for the air wa keen
then i said
let us go to the other ship and see what ha chanc there
thei got out the oar and row to ragnar vessel where we saw men
stir
how went it with you i ask of on who stood upon the prow
not so ill olaf he answer we won and but now with the new
light have finish the game thei ar all quiet yonder he ad
nod at the vessel of athalbrand to which thei were still grappl
where is ragnar i ask
come on board and see answer the man
a plank wa thrust out and i ran across it fear grip at my heart
rest against the mast sat ragnar dy
good morrow to you olaf he gasp i am glad you live that there
mai be on left to sit at aar
what do you mean my brother
i mean olaf that our father thorvald is dead thei call it to us
from yonder and he point with hi red sword to our father ship
that lai side by side with on of athalbrand athalbrand is dead
for i slew him and er the sun is well clear of the sea i also shall
be dead oh weep not olaf we have won a great fight and i travel
to valhalla with a gloriou compani of friend and foe there to await
you i sai that had i live to be old never could i have found a better
death who then at last might have di like a cow get the ship to
fladstrand olaf and gather more men to put all lesso to the sword
give us good burial olaf and build a great mound over us that we mai
stand thereon at moonris and mock the men of lesso as thei row past
till valhalla is full and the world di is steinar dead tell me that
steinar is dead for then ill speak with him present
no ragnar i have taken steinar captiv
captiv why captiv oh i understand that he mai lie on odin
altar friend swear to me that steinar shall lie on odin altar
steinar the bridethief seiner the traitor swear it for i do not
trust thi brother of mine who ha woman milk in hi breast by
thor he might spare him if he had hi wai swear it or ill haunt your
bed o night and bring the other hero with me swift now while my
ear ar open
then from both ship rose the cry of

see in your ey a new light a strang light olaf you ar not on of
us thi time is not your time nor thi place your place you travel to
the end by anoth road well who know at that end we mai meet again

then he burst into a wild war song of blood and vengeanc and so
sing sank down and di
afterward with much labour i and the men who were left rope
togeth our vessel and to them those that we had captur and when
a favour wind aros sail back for fladstrand here a multitud
await us for a fishingboat had brought tide of the great sea
battl of the hundr and fifti men who had sail in my father
thorvald ship sixti were dead and mani other wound some of
them to death athalbrand peopl had fare even wors sinc those of
thorvald had slain their wound onli on of hi vessel have escap
back to lesso there to tell the peopl of that island and iduna all
that had happen now it wa a land of widow and orphan so that no
man need go woo there for long and of aar and the countri round the
same song wa sung inde for gener the folk of those part
must have told of the battl of lesso when the chief thorvald and
athalbrand slew each other upon the sea at night becaus of a quarrel
about a woman who wa known as iduna the fair
on the sand of fladstrand my mother the ladi thora wait with the
other for she had move thither befor the sail of the ship when
mine the first of them wa beach i leapt from it and run to
her knelt down and kiss her hand
i see you my son olaf she said but where ar your father and
brother
yonder mother i answer point to the ship and could sai no
more
then why do thei tarri my son
ala mother becaus thei sleep and will never wake again
now thora wail aloud and fell down senseless three dai later she
di for her heart which wa weak could not bear thi woe onc onli
did she speak befor she di and then it wa to bless me and prai that
we might meet again and to curs iduna folk note that of steinar she
said noth either good or ill although she knew that he live and
wa a prison
thu it came about that i olaf wa left alon in the world and
inherit the lordship of aar and it subject land no on remain
save my darkbrow uncl leif the priest of odin freydisa the wise
woman my nurs and steinar my captiv fosterbroth who had been
the caus of all thi war
the dy word of ragnar had been nois abroad the priest of odin had
laid them befor the oracl of the god and thi oracl declar that
thei must be fulfil without chang
so all the folk of that land met togeth at my biddingy even
the women and the children first we laid the dead in the largest
of athalbrand ship hi peopl and athalbrand himself be set
undermost then on them we set the dead of thorvald thorvald my
father and hi son ragnar my brother bound to the mast upon their
feet thi done with great labour we drag the ship on to high
ground and abov it built a mighti mound of earth for twenti dai
we toil at the task till at last it wa finish and the dead were
hidden beneath it for ever then we separ to our home and mourn a
while
but steinar wa carri to the templ of odin at aar and there kept in
the prison of the templ
chapter vi
how olaf fought with odin
it wa the ev of the spring feast of odin it come back to me that at
thi feast it wa the custom to sacrific some beast to odin and to lai
flower and other offer upon the altar of certain other god that
thei might be pleas to grant a fruit season on thi dai howev
the sacrific wa to be of no beast but of a mansteinar the traitor
that night i olaf by the help of freydisa the priestess of the god
won entranc to the dungeon where steinar lai await hi doom thi
wa not easi to do inde i rememb that it wa onli after i had
sworn a great oath to leif and the other priest that i would attempt no
rescu of the victim nor aid him to escap from hi prison that i
wa admit there while arm men stood without to see that i did not
break my word for my love of steinar wa known and in thi matter none
trust me
that dungeon wa a dread place i see it now in the floor of the
templ wa a trapdoor which when lift reveal a flight of step
at the foot of these step wa anoth massiv door of oak bolt
and bar it wa open and close behind me who found myself in a
darksom den built of rough stone to which air came onli through an
open in the roof so small that not even a child could pass it in
the far corner of thi hole bound to the wall by an iron chain fasten
round hi middl steinar lai upon a bed of rush while on a stool
besid him stood food and water when i enter bear a lamp steinar
sat up blink hi ey for the light feebl as it wa hurt them
and i saw that hi face wa white and drawn and the hand he held to
shade hi ey wa wast i look at him and my heart swell with
piti so that i could not speak
why have you come here olaf ask steinar when he knew me is it to
take my life if so never were you more welcom
no steinar it is to bid you farewel sinc tomorrow at the feast
you die and i am helpless to save you in all thing els men will obei
me but not in thi
and would you save me if you could
ay steinar why not sure you must suffer enough with so much blood
and evil on your hand
ye i suffer enough olaf so much that i shall be glad to die but
if you ar not come to kill me then it is that you mai scourg me with
your tongu
not so steinar it is as i have said onli to bid you farewel and to
ask you a question if it pleas you to answer me why did you do thi
thing which ha brought about such miseri and loss which ha sent my
father my brother and a host of brave men to the grave and with them
my mother whose breast nurs you
is she dead also olaf oh my cup is full he hid hi ey in hi
thin hand and sob then went on why did i do it olaf i did not
do it but some spirit that enter into me and made me madmad for the
lip of iduna the fair olaf i would speak no ill of her sinc her sin
is mine but yet it is true that when i hung back she drew me on nor
could i find the strength to sai her nai do you prai the god olaf
that no woman mai ever draw you on to such shame as mine hearken now
to the great reward that i have won i wa never wed to iduna olaf
athalbrand would not suffer it till he wa sure of the matter of the
lordship of agger then when he knew that thi wa gone from me he
would suffer it still less and iduna herself seem to grow cold
in truth i believ he thought of kill me and send my head as a
present to your father thorvald but thi iduna forbad whether becaus
she love me or for other reason i cannot sai olaf you know the
rest
ay steinar i know the rest iduna is lost to me and for that
perhap i should thank you although such a thrust as thi leav the
heart sore for life my father my mother my brotheral ar lost to
me and you too who were as my twin ar about to be lost night ha
you all and with you a hundr other men becaus of the mad that
wa bred in you by the ey of iduna the fair who also is lost to
both of us steinar i do not blame you for i know your wa a mad
which for their own end the god send upon men name it love i
forgiv you steinar if i have aught to forgiv and i tell you so
weari am i of thi world which i feel hold littl that is good that
if i might id yield up my life instead of your and go to seek the
other though i doubt whether i should find them sinc i think that
our road ar differ hark the priest call me steinar there no
need to bid you to be brave for who of our northern race is not that
our on heritag the courag of a bull yet it seem to me that there
ar other sort of courag which we lack to tread the dark wai of
death with ey fix on thing gentler and better than we know prai
to our god steinar sinc thei ar the best we have to prai to
though dark and bloodi in their wai prai that we mai meet again where
priest and sword ar not and women work no ruin where we mai love as
we onc love in childhood and there is no more sin fare you well my
brother steinar yet not for ever for sure i am that here we did not
begin and here we shall not end oh steinar steinar who could have
dream that thi would be the last of all our happi fellowship
when i had spoken such word as these to him i flung my arm about him
and we embrac each other then that pictur fade
it wa the hour of sacrific the victim lai bound upon the stone in
the presenc of the statu of the god but outsid of the door of the
littl templ that all who were gather there might see the offer
the ceremoni were end leif the head priest in hi robe of offic
had prai and drunk the cup befor the god dedic to him the blood
that wa about to fall and narrat in a chant the crime for which
it wa offer up and all the tale of woe that these had brought about
then in the midst of an utter silenc he drew the sacrifici sword
and held it to the lip of odin that the god might breath upon it and
make it holi
it would seem that the god did breath at least that side of the sword
which had been bright grew dull leif turn it to the peopl cry in
the ancient word
odin take who dare deni
all ey were fix upon him stand in hi black robe and hold
aloft the gleam sword that had grown dull ye even the patient ey
of steinar bound upon the stone
then it wa that some spirit stir in my heart which drove me on to
step between the priest and hi prei stand in the doorwai of the
chapel a tall young shape against the gloom behind i said in a steadi
voic
i dare deni
a gasp of wonder went up from all who heard and steinar lift
himself a littl from the stone stare at me shook hi head as if in
dissent then let it fall again and listen
hearken friend i said thi man my fosterbroth ha commit
a sin against me and my hous my hous is deadi alon remain and on
behalf of the dead and of myself i forgiv him hi sin which inde
wa less hi than anoth is there ani man among you who at some time
ha not been led asid by woman or who ha not again and again desir
to be so led asid if such a on there be let him sai that he ha no
forgiv in hi heart for steinar the son of hakon let him come
forward and sai it
none stir even the women droop their head and were silent
then if thi is so i went on and you can forgiv as i do how
much more should a god forgiv what is a god is he not on greater
than man who must know all the weak of man which for hi own
end he ha bred into the flesh of man how then can he do otherwis
than be piti to what he ha creat if thi be so how can the
god refus that which men ar will to grant and what sacrific can
pleas him better than the forego of hi own vengeanc would a god
wish to be outdon by a man if i olaf the man can forgiv who have
been wrong how much more can odin the god forgiv who ha suffer
no wrong save that of the break of those law which will ever be
broken by men who ar as it ha pleas him to fashion them on odin
behalf therefor and speak as he would speak could he have voic
among us i demand that you set thi victim free leav it to hi own
heart to punish him
now some whom my simpl word had touch i suppos becaus there wa
truth in them although in those dai and in that land none understood
such truth and other becaus thei had known and love the
openhand steinar who would have given the cloak from hi back to the
meanest of them cri
ay let him go free there ha been enough of death through thi
iduna
but more stood silent lost in doubt at thi new doctrin onli leif
my uncl did not stand silent hi dark face began to work as though
a devil possess him as inde i think on did hi ey roll he
champ hi jaw like an angri hog and scream
sure the lord olaf is mad for no sane man would talk thu man
mai forgiv while it is within hi power but thi traitor ha been
dedic to odin and can a god forgiv can a god spare when hi
nostril ar open for the smell of blood if so of what us is it to
be a god how is he happier than a man if he must spare moreov
would ye bring the curs of odin upon you all i sai to yousteal hi
sacrific and you yourselv shall be sacrif you your wive your
children ay and even your cattl and the fruit of your field
when thei heard thi the peopl groan and shout out
let steinar die kill him kill him that odin mai be fed
ay answer leif steinar shall die see he di
then with a leap like to that of a hungri wolf he sprang upon the
bound man and slew him
i see it now the rude templ the glare statu of the god the
gather crowd open mouth and ei the spring sunshin shine
quietli over all and run past the place a ew call to the lamb
that it had lost i see the dy steinar turn hi white face and
smile a farewel to me with hi fade ey i see leif get to hi
horribl rite that he might learn the omen and lastli i see the red
sword of the wander appear suddenli between me and him and in my
hand i think that my purpos wa to cut him down onli a thought aros
within me
thi priest wa not to blame he did no more than he had been taught
who taught him the god he serv through whom he gain honour and
livelihood so the god wa to blame the god that drank the blood of
men as a thrall drink al to satisfi hi filthi appetit could such
a monster be a god nai he must be a devil and why should free men
serv devil at least i would not i would cast him off and let him
aveng himself upon me if he could i olaf would match myself against
thi godor devil
i strode past leif and the altar to where the statu of odin sat within
the templ
hearken i said in such a voic that all lift their ey from the
scene of butcheri to me you believ in odin do you not
thei answer ay
then you believ that he can reveng himself upon on who reject and
affront him
ay thei answer again
if thi be so i went on will you swear to leav the matter between
odin and me olaf to be settl accord to the law of singl combat
and give peac to the victor with promis from all harm save at the
hand of hi foe
ay thei answer yet scarc understand what thei said
good i cri now god odin i olaf a man challeng you to singl
combat strike you first you odin whom i name devil and wolf of the
ski but no god strike you first bloodi murder and kill me if
you can who await your stroke
then i fold my arm and stare at the statu stoni ey which
stare back at me while all the peopl gasp
for a full minut i wait thu but all that happen wa that a wren
settl on the head of odin and twitter there then flew off to it
nest in the thatch
now i cri you have had your turn and mine come
i drew the wander sword and sprang at odin my first stroke sunk up
to the hilt in hi hollow belli my next cut the sceptr from hi hand
my thirda great onehew the head from off him it came rattl
down and out of it crawl a viper which rear itself up and hiss
i set my heel upon the reptil head and crush it and slowli it
writh itself to death
now good folk i cri what sai you of your god odin
thei answer noth for all of them were in flight ye even leif
fled curs me over hi shoulder as he went
present i wa alon with the dead steinar and the shatter god and
in that loneli strang vision came to me for i felt that i had
done a mighti deed on that made me happi round the wall of the
templ crept a figur it wa that of freydisa whose face wa white and
scare
you ar a great man olaf she said but how will it end
i do not know i answer i have done what my heart told me neither
more nor less and i bide the issu odin shall have hi chanc for
here i stai till dark and then if i live i leav thi land go get
me all the gold that is mine from the hall and bring it here to me by
moonris and with it some garment and my armour bring me also my best
hors
you leav thi land she said that mean that you leav me who love
you to go forth as the wander wentfollow a dream to the south
well it is best that you should go for whatev thei have promis you
but now it is sure that the priest will kill you even if you escap
the vengeanc of the god and she look askanc at the shatter
statu which had sat in it place for so mani gener that none knew
who had set it there or when
i have kill the god i answer point to the crush viper
not quit olaf for see it tail still move
then she went leav me alon i sat myself down by the murder
steinar and stare at him could he be realli dead i wonder or did
he live on elsewher my faith had taught me of a place call valhalla
where brave men went but in that faith and it god i believ no more
thi valhalla wa but a child tale invent by a bloodymind folk
who love slaughter wherev steinar and the other were it wa not in
valhalla then perhap thei slept like the beast do after these have
been butcher perhap death wa the end of all it might be so and
yet i did not believ it there were other god besid odin and hi
compani for what were those which we had found in the wander tomb
i long to know
ye i would go south as the wander went and search for them
perhap there in the south i should learn the secret truthand other
thing
i grew weari of these thought of god who could not be found or who
if found were but devil my mind went back to my childhood dai
when steinar and i plai togeth on the mead befor ani woman had
come to wreck our live i rememb how we us to plai until we were
weari and how at night i would tell him tale that i had learn or
woven until at length we sank to sleep our arm about each other
neck my heart grew full of sorrow that in the end broke from my ey
in tear ye i wept over steinar my brother steinar and kiss hi
cold and gori lip
the even gather the twilight grew and on by on the star
sprang out in the quiet sky till the moon appear and gather all
their radianc to herself i heard the sound of a woman dress and
look up think to see freydisa but thi woman wa not freydisa it
wa iduna ye iduna self
i rose to my feet and stood still she also stood still on the farther
side of the stone of sacrific whereon that which had been steinar wa
stretch between us then came a struggl of silenc in which she won
at last
have you come to save him i ask if so it is too late woman
behold your work
she shook her beauti head and answer almost in a whisper
nai olaf i am come to beg a boon of you that you will slai me here
and now
am i a butcheror a priest i mutter
oh slai me slai me olaf she went on throw herself upon her
knee befor me and rend open her blue robe that her young breast
might take the sword thu perchanc i who love life mai pai some
of the price of sin who if i slew myself would but multipli the debt
which in truth i dare not do
still i shook my head and onc more she spoke
olaf in thi wai or in that doubtless my end will find me for if you
refus thi offic there ar other of sterner stuff the knife that
smote steinar is not blunt yet befor i die who am come here but to
die i prai you hear the truth that my memori mai be somewhat less vile
to you in the after year olaf you think me the falsest of the fals
yet i am not altogeth so hark you now at the time that steinar
sought me some mad took him so soon as we were alon togeth hi
first word were i am bewitch i love you
olaf ill not deni that hi worship stir my blood for he wa
goodlywel and differ to you with your dream ey and thought
that ar too deep for me and yet by my breath i swear that i meant

i told him what wa true that of you twain it wa you i love not
steinar i told him that if he forc thi marriag war would come of
it that might mean all our death but these thing move him noth
then i told him that such a deed of shame would mean the loss of
steinar lordship so that by it he would gain no profit at last he

father and ragnar who ever hate me press on the war despit all
our offer of peac so the ship met and hela had her fill

now i stare at her could thi woman lie so blackli over dead steinar
corps when all wa said and done wa it not possibl that she spoke
the truth and that we had been but playth in the hand of an evil
fate save for some trifl error which might be forgiven to on who

were innoc after all
perhap my face show the thought that were pass through my mind

toward me still on her knee she cast her arm about me and rest
her weight upon me drew herself to her feet
olaf she whisper i love you i love you well as i have alwai
done though i mai have er a littl as women wayward and still unw
ar apt to do olaf thei told me yonder how you had match yourself
against the god with hi priest for judg and smitten him and i

her arm clung about me her beauti blue ey shimmer with
moonlit tear held my ey and my heart melt beneath her breath as
winter snow melt in the wind of spring she saw she understood she
cast herself upon me shake her long hair over both of us and seek
my lip almost she had found them when feel someth hard between
me and her someth that hurt me i look down her cloak had slip
or been thrown asid and my ey caught the glint of gold and jewel in
an instant i rememberedth wander necklac and the dreamand with
those memori my heart froze again
nai iduna i said i love you well there no man will ever love
you more and you ar veri fair whether you speak true word or fals
i do not know it is between you and your own spirit but thi i do
know that betwixt us run the river of steinar blood ay and
the blood of thorvald my father of thora my mother of ragnar my
brother and of mani anoth man who clung to us and that is a stream
which i cannot cross find you anoth husband iduna the fair sinc
never will i call you wife
she loos her arm from round me and lift them again unclasp
the wander necklac from about her breast
thi it is she said which ha brought all these evil on me take
it back again and when you find her give it to that on for whom
it is meant that on whom you love truli as whatev you mai have
thought you never have love me
then she sank upon the ground and rest her golden head upon dead
steinar breast she wept
i think it wa then that freydisa return at least i recal her tall
form stand near the stone of sacrific gaze at us both a strang
smile on her face
have you withstood she said then truli you ar in the wai of
victori and have less to fear from woman than i thought all thing

meanwhil all i have is your with thi charg guard you yonder
woman and see her safe to her home or wherev she would go and to
steinar here give honour burial
then the dark of oblivion fall and i rememb no more save
the white face of iduna her brow stain with steinar lifeblood
watch me as i went
book ii
byzantium
chapter i
iren empress of the earth
a gulf of black and the curtain lift again upon a veri differ
olaf from the young northern lord who part from iduna at the place of
sacrific at aar
i see myself stand upon a terrac that overlook a stretch of quiet
water which i now know wa the bosphoru behind me ar a great palac
and the light of a vast citi in front upon the sea and upon the
farther shore ar other light the moon shine bright abov me and
have naught els to do i studi my reflect in my own burnish
shield it show a man of earli middl life he mai be thirti or
fiveandthirti year of ag the same olaf yet much chang for now
my frame is tall and wellknit though still somewhat slender my face
is bronz by southern sun i wear a short beard there is a scar
across my cheek got in some battl my ey ar quiet and have lost
the first liveli of youth i know that i am the captain of the
northern guard of the empress iren widow of the dead emperor leo
the fourth and joint ruler of the eastern empir with her young son
constantin the sixth of that name
how i came to fill thi place howev i do not know the stori of my
journei from jutland to byzantium is lost to me doubtless it must have
taken year and after these more year of humbl servic befor i rose
to be the captain of iren northern guard that she kept ever about her
person becaus she would not trust her grecian soldier
my armour wa veri rich yet i note about myself two thing that were
with me in my youth on wa the necklac of golden shell divid from
each other by beetl of emerald that i had taken from the wander
grave at aar and the other the crosshilt bronz sword with which
thi same wander had been gird in hi grave i know now that becaus
of thi weapon which wa of a metal and shape strang to that land i
had the bynam of olaf redsword and i know also that none wish to
feel the weight of thi same ancient blade
when i had finish look at myself in the shield i lean upon the
parapet stare at the sea and wonder how the plain of aar look
that night beneath thi selfsam moon and whether freydisa were dead
by now and whom iduna had marri and if she ever thought of me or if
steinar came to haunt her sleep
so i muse till present i felt a light touch upon my shoulder and
swung round to find myself face to face with the empress iren herself
augusta i said salut for as empress that wa her roman titl
even though she wa a greek
you guard me well friend olaf she said with a littl laugh why
ani enemi and christ know i have plenti could have cut you down
befor ever you knew that he wa there
not so augusta i answer for i could speak their greek tongu
well sinc at the end of the terrac the guard stand night and dai
men of my own blood who can be trust noth which doe not fly could
gain thi place save through your own chamber that ar also guard
it is not usual for ani watch to be set here still i came myself in
case the empress might need me
that is kind of you my captain olaf and i think i do need you at
least i cannot sleep in thi heat and i am weari of the thought of
state for mani matter troubl me just now come chang my mind if
you can for if so ill thank you tell me of yourself when you were
young why did you leav your northern home where iv heard you were a
barbarian chief and wander hither to byzantium
becaus of a woman i answer
ah she said clap her hand i knew it tell me of thi woman
whom you love
the stori is short augusta she bewitch my fosterbroth and
caus him to be sacrif to the northern god as a trothbreak and
i do not love her
youd not admit it if you did olaf wa she beauti well sai as i
am
i turn and look at the empress studi her from head to foot she
wa shorter than iduna by some inch also older and therefor of a
thicker build but be a fair greek her colour wa much the same
save that the ey were darker the mouth too wa more hard for the
rest she wa a royallook and love woman in the flower of her ag
and splendidli attir in robe broider with gold over which she wore
long string of round pearl her rippl golden hair wa dress in
the old greek fashion ti in a simpl knot behind her head and over
it wa thrown a light veil work with golden star
well captain olaf she said have you finish weigh my poor
look against those of thi northern girl in the scale of your
judgment if so which of us tip the beam
iduna wa more beauti than ever you can have been augusta i
repli quietli
she stare at me till her ey grew quit round then pucker up
her mouth as though to sai someth furiou and final burst out
laugh
by everi saint in byzantium she said or rather by their relic
for of live on there ar none you ar the strangest man whom i have
known ar you weari of life that you dare to sai such a thing to me
the empress iren
am i weari of life well augusta on the whole i think i am it seem
to me that death and after it mai interest us more for the rest you
ask me a question and after the fashion of my peopl i answer it
as truthfulli as i could
by my head you have said it again she exclaim have you not
heard most innoc northman that there ar truth which should not be
mention and much less repeat
i have heard mani thing in byzantium augusta but i pai no attent
to ani of themor inde to littl except my duti
now that thi thiswhat the girl name
iduna the fair i said
thi iduna ha thrown you over at which i am sure i do not wonder
what mistress have you in byzantium olaf the dane
none at all i answer women ar pleasant but on mai bui sweet
too dear and all that ever i saw put togeth were not worth my brother
steinar who lost hi life through on of them
tell me captain olaf ar you a secret member of thi new societi of
hermit of which thei talk so much who if thei see a woman must hold
their face in the sand for five minut afterward
i never heard of them augusta
ar you a christian
no i am consid that religionor rather it follow
ar you a pagan then
no i fought a duel with the god odin and cut hi head off with thi
sword and that is why i left the north where thei worship odin
then what ar you she said stamp her foot in exasper
i am the captain of your imperi majesti privat guard a littl of
a philosoph and a fair poet in my own languag not in greek also i
can plai the harp
you sai not in greek for fear lest i should ask you to write vers
to me which inde i shall never do olaf a soldier a poet a
philosoph a harpist on who ha renounc women now why have you
renounc women which is unnatur in a man who is not a monk it must
be becaus you still love thi iduna and hope to get her some dai
i shook my head and answer
i might have done that long ago augusta
then it must be becaus there is some other woman whom you wish to
gain why do you alwai wear that strang necklac she ad sharpli
did it belong to thi savag girl iduna as from the look of it it
might well have done
not so augusta she took it for a while and it brought sorrow on her
as it will do on all women save on who mai or mai not live todai
give it me i have taken a fanci to it it is unusu oh fear not
you shall receiv it valu
if you wish the necklac augusta you must take the head as well and
my counsel to you is that you do neither sinc thei will bring you no
good luck
in truth captain olaf you anger me with your riddl what do you
mean about thi necklac
i mean augusta that i took it from a veri ancient grave
that i can believ for the jewel who made it work in old egypt
she interrupt
and thereaft i dream a dream i went on of the woman who
wear the other half of it i have not seen her yet but when i do i
shall know her at onc
so she exclaim did i not tell you that east or west or north or
south there is some other woman
there wa onc augusta quit a thousand year ago or more and there
mai be again now or a thousand year henc that is what i am try
to find out you sai the work is egyptian augusta at your conveni
will you be pleas to make anoth captain in my place i would visit
egypt
if you leav byzantium without express permiss under my own
handnot the emperor or anybodi els hand mine i sayand ar
caught your ey shall be put out as a desert she said savag
as the augusta pleas i answer salut
olaf she went on in a more gentl voic you ar clearli mad but
to tell truth you ar also a madman who pleas me sinc i weari of
the rogu and lickspittl who call themselv sane in byzantium why
there not a man in all the citi who would dare to speak to me as
you have spoken tonight and like that breez from the sea it is
refresh lend me that necklac olaf till tomorrow morn i want
to examin it in the lamplight and i swear to you that i will not take
it from you or plai you ani trick about it
will you promis not to wear it augusta
of cours is it like that i should wish to wear it on my bare breast
after it ha been rub against your soil armour
without anoth word i unhook the necklac and hand it to her she
ran to a littl distanc and with on of those swift movement that
were common to her fasten it about her own neck then she return
and threw the great string of pearl which she had remov to make
place for it over my head
now have you found the woman of that dream olaf she ask turn
herself about in the moonlight
i shook my head and answer
nai augusta but i fear that you have found misfortun when
it come i prai you to rememb that you promis not to wear the
necklac also that your soldier olaf thorvald son would have given
hi life rather than that you should have done so not for the sake
of ani dream but for your sake augusta whom it is hi busi to
protect
would then it were your busi either to protect me a littl more
or a littl less she exclaim bitterli
have utter thi dark sai she vanish from the terrac still
wear the string of golden shell
on the follow morn the necklac wa return to me by iren
favourit ladi who smile as she gave it to me she wa a darkei
witti and abl girl name martina who had been my friend for a long
while
the augusta said that you were to examin thi jewel to see that it ha
not been chang
i never suggest that the augusta wa a thief i repli therefor
it is unnecessari
she said also that i wa to tell you in case you should think that it
ha been befoul by her wear of it that she ha had it carefulli
clean
that is thought of her martina for it need wash now will
you take the augusta pearl which she left with me in error
i have no order to take ani pearl captain olaf although i did
notic that two of the finest string in the empir ar miss oh you
great northern child she ad in a whisper keep the pearl thei
ar a gift and worth a princ ransom and take whatev els you can
get and keep that too
i have no further vision concern these priceless
pearl and do not know what becam of them perhap i wa
rob of them dure my imprison or perhap i gave
them to heliodor or to martina where ar thei now i
wondereditor
then befor i could answer her she wa gone
for some week after thi i saw no more of the augusta who appear
to avoid me on dai howev i wa summon to her presenc in her
privat apart by the waitingladi martina and went to find her
alon save for martina the first thing that i notic wa that she
wore about her neck an exact copi of the necklac of golden shell and
emerald beetl further that about her waist wa a girdl and on her
wrist a bracelet of similar design pretend to see noth i salut
and stood to attent
captain she began yonderand she wave her hand toward the citi
so that i could not fail to see the shell braceletth uncl of my
son the emperor lie in prison have you heard of the matter and if
so what have you heard
i have heard augusta that the emperor have been defeat by
the bulgarian some of the legion propos to set hi uncl
nicephorush who ha been made a priestupon the throne i have
heard further that thereon the emperor caus the csar nicephoru to
be blind and the tongu of the two other csar and of their two
brother the nobilissimi to be slit
do you think well of such a deed olaf
augusta i answer in thi citi i make it my busi not to think
for if i did i should certainli go mad
still on thi matter i command you to think and to speak the truth of
your thought no harm shall come to you whatev thei mai be
augusta i obei you i think that whoever did thi wick thing must be
a devil either return from that hell of which everyon is so fond of
talk here or on the road thither
oh you think that do you so i wa right when i told martina that
there wa onli on honest opinion to be had in constantinopl and i knew
where to get it well most sever and indign judg suppos i tell
you it wa i who command that thi deed should be done then would you
chang your judgment
not so augusta i should onli think much wors of you than ever i did
befor if these great person were traitor to the state thei should
have been execut but to torment them to take awai the sight of
heaven and to bring them to the level of dumb beast all that their
actual blood mai not be on the tormentor handwhi the act is vile
so at least it would be held in those northern land which you ar
pleas to call barbarian
now iren sprang from her seat and clap her hand for joi
you hear what he sai martina and the emperor shall hear it too ay
and so shall my minist stauraciu and aetiu who support him in
thi matter i alon withstood him i prai him for hi soul sake to
be merci he answer that he would no longer be govern by a woman
that he knew how to safeguard hi empir and what conscienc should
allow and what refus so in spite of all my tear and prayer the
vile deed wa done as i think for no good caus well it cannot
be undon yet olaf i fear that it mai be ad to and that these
royalborn men mai be foulli murder therefor i put you in charg of
the prison where thei lie here is the sign order take with you what
men you mai think need and hold that place even should the emperor
himself command you to open see also that the prison within ar
care for and have all thei need but do not suffer them to escap
i salut and turn to go when iren call me back
at that moment too in obedi to some sign which she made martina
left the chamber look at me oddli as she did so i came and stood
befor the empress who i note seem somewhat troubl for her
breast heav and her gaze wa fix upon the floor now it wa of
mosaic and repres a heathen goddess talk to a young man who
stood befor her with hi arm fold the goddess wa angri with the
man and held in her left hand a dagger as though she would stab him
although her right arm wa stretch out to embrac him and her attitud
wa on of plead
iren lift her head and i saw that her fine ey were fill with
tear
olaf she said i am in much troubl and i know not where to find a
friend
i smile and answer
need an empress seek far for friend
ay olaf farther than anyon who breath an empress can find
flatter and partisan but not a singl friend such love her onli
for what she can give them but if fortun went against her i sai that
thei would fall awai like leav from a tree in a winter frost so that
she stood nake to everi bitter blast of heaven ye and then would
come the foe and root up that tree and burn it to give them warmth and
to celebr their triumph so i think olaf it will be with me befor
all is done even my son hate me olaf my onli child for whose true
welfar i strive night and dai
i have heard as much augusta i said
you have heard like all the world but what els of ill have you heard
of me olaf speak out man im here to learn the truth
i have heard that you ar veri ambiti augusta and that you hate
your son as much as he hate you becaus he is a rival to your power
it is rumour that you would be glad if he were dead and you left to
reign alon
then a lie is rumour olaf yet it is true that i am ambiti who
see far and would build thi totter empir up afresh olaf it is a
bitter thing to have begotten a fool
then why do you not marri again and beget other who might be no
fool augusta i ask bluntli
ah why she answer flash a curiou glanc upon me in truth i
do not quit know why but from no lack of suitor sinc were she but
a hideou hag an empress would find these olaf you mai have learn
that i wa not born in the purpl i wa but a greek girl of good race
not even nobl to whom god gave a gift of beauti and when i wa young
i saw a man who took my fanci also of old race yet but a merchant of
fruit which thei grow in greec and sell here and at rome i wish to
marri him but my mother a farse woman said that such beauti
as minethough less than that of your iduna the fair olafwa worth
monei or rank so thei sent awai my merchant of fruit who marri the
daughter of anoth merchant of fruit and throve veri well in busi
he came to see me some year ago fat as a tub hi face score all over
with the mark of the spot sick and we talk about old time
i gave him a concess to import dri fruit into byzantiumthat
is what he came to see me forand now he dead well my mother wa
right for afterward thi poor beauti of mine took the fanci of the
late emperor and be veri piou he marri me so the greek girl
by the will of god becam augusta and the first woman in the world
by the will of god i repeat
ay i suppos so or els all is raw chanc at least i who todai
might have been bargain over dri fruit as i should have done had
i won my will amwhat you know look at thi robe and she spread her
glitter dress befor me hark to the tramp of those guard befor my
door why you ar their captain go into the antechamb and see the
ambassador wait there in the hope of a word with the ruler of
the earth look at my legion muster on the drillingground and
understand how great the grecian girl ha grown by virtu of the face
which is less beauteou than that ofiduna the fair
i understand all thi augusta i answer yet it would seem that
you ar not happi did you not tell me just now that you could not find
a friend and that you had begotten a fool
happi olaf why i am wretch so wretch that often i think the
hell of which the priest preach is here on earth and that i dwell in
it hottest fire unless love hide it what happi is there in thi
life of our which must end in blackest death
love ha it miseri also augusta that i know for onc i love
ay but then the love wa not true for thi is the greatest curs of
allto love and not to be belov for the sake of a perfect love if
it could be wonwhi id sacrific even my ambit
then you must keep your ambit augusta sinc in thi world youll
find noth perfect
olaf im not so sure thought have come to me olaf i told you that
i have no friend in all thi glitter court will you be my friend
i am your honest servant augusta and i think that such a on is the
best of friend
that so and yet no man can be true friend to a woman unless he
ismor than friend natur ha writ it so
i do not understand i answer
you mean that you will not understand and perhap you ar wise why
do you stare at that pavement there a stori written on it the old
goddess of my peopl aphrodit love a certain adonisso run the
fablebut he love not her and thought onli of hi sport look she
woo him there and he reject her and in her rage she stab him
not so i answer of the end of the stori i know noth but if
she had meant to kill him the dagger would be in her right hand not in
her left
that true olaf and in the end it wa fate which kill him not
the goddess whom he had scorn and yet olaf it is not wise to scorn
goddess oh of what do i talk youll befriend me will you not
ay augusta to the last drop of my blood as is my duti do i not
take your pai
then thu i seal our friendship and here an earnest of the pai
iren said slowli and bend forward she kiss me on the lip
at thi moment the door of the chamber were thrown open through them

minist stauraciu a fat oilyfac man with a cun ey who

to bow at each third step as wa the custom the process wa somewhat
long and as i reach the door i heard her sai to stauraciu

secret order to my trust offic and not be spi upon by you now
ceas your grovel and lead in these persian as you have been

antechamb with their slave and gift i gain the great terrac of
the palac which look upon the sea here i found martina lean on
the parapet
have you more of the augusta pearl about you olaf she ask
mockingli speak over her shoulder

inde i could have sworn otherwis for thei ar perfum and i
seem to catch their odour when did you begin to us the royal scent
upon that yellow beard of your olaf if ani of us women did so it
would mean blow and exil but perchanc a captain of the guard mai be
forgiven

pai and place you ar in good favour olaf and i hope that when you
come to great you will not forget martina it wa i who put it into
a certain mind to give you thi commiss as the onli man that could be
trust in the court
i do not forget a friend martina i answer
that is your reput olaf oh what a road is open to your feet
yet i doubt youll not walk it be too honest or if you do that it
will lead younot to glori but a grave
mayhap martina and to speak truth a grave is the onli quiet place in
constantinopl mayhap too it hide the onli real glori
that what we christian sai it would be strang if you who ar not
a christian alon should believ and keep the sai oh she went on
with passion we ar but sham and liar whom god must hate well i
go to make readi for thi journei to the bath
how long do you stai there i ask
the cours of water take a month less than that time doe not serv
to clear the augusta skin and restor her shape to the line of youth
which it begin to need though doubtless you do not think so you
were name to come as her offic of the person but olaf thi other
busi rose up of a new governor for the jail in which the csar and
nobilissimi ar confin i saw a chanc for you in it who although
you have serv all these year have had no real advanc and
mention your name at which the augusta leapt to tell the truth
olaf i wa not sure that you would wish to be captain of the guard at
the bath wa i right or wa i wrong
i think you were right martina bath ar idl place where folk drift
into troubl and i follow duti martinamai i sai it to youyou
ar a good woman and a kind i prai that those god of your whom you
worship mai bless you
you prai in vain olaf for that thei will never do inde i think
that thei have curs me
then suddenli she burst into tear and turn went awai
i too went awai somewhat bewild for much had happen to me that
morn which i found it hard to understand why had the augusta kiss
me i took it that thi wa some kind of imperi jest it wa known
that i kept aloof from women and she mai have desir to see what i
should do when an augusta kiss me and then to make a mock of me i
had heard that she had done as much with other
well let that be sinc stauraciu who alwai fear lest a new
favourit should slip between him and power had settl the matter for
me for which i bless stauraciu although at the moment be but a
man i had curs him and now why did martinath littl dark martina
with the kind face and the watch beadi ey like to those of a
robin in our northern landsspeak as she had done and then burst into
tear
a doubt struck me but i who wa never vain push it asid i did not
understand and of what us wa it to try to interpret the mean of
the mood of women my busi wa war or at the moment the servic
that ha to do with war not women war had brought me to the rank i
held though strang enough of those war i can recal noth now
thei have vanish from my vision to war also i look to advanc me
in the futur who wa no courtier but a soldier whom circumst
had brought to court well thank to martina as she said or to some
capric of the empress i had a new commiss that wa of more worth to
me than her random kiss and i would go to read it
read it i did in the littl privat room upon the palac wall which wa
mine as captain of the augusta guard though be written in
greek i found thi difficult martina had spoken truli i wa made the
governor of the state prison with all author includ that of life
and death should emerg aris moreov thi governorship gave me
the rank of a gener with a gener pai also such pick as
i chose to take in short from captain of the guard suddenli i had
becom a great man in constantinopl on with whom even stauraciu
and other like him would have to reckon especi as hi signatur
appear upon the commiss beneath that of the empress
whilst i wa wonder what i should do next a trumpet blew upon the
rampart and a northman of my compani enter salut and said that i
wa summon i went out and there befor me stood a dazzl band
that bow humbl to me whom yesterdai thei would have pass without
notic their captain a smoothfac greek came forward and
address me as gener said the imperi order were that he wa to
escort me to the state jail
for what purpos i ask sinc it came to my mind that iren might
have chang her fanci and issu anoth kind of commiss
as it gener and governor illustri he repli
then i will lead i answer do you follow behind me
thu that vision end
in the next i see myself dwell in some state apart that form
the antechamb to the great prison thi prison which wa situat
not far from the forum of constantin cover a larg area of ground
which includ a garden where the prison were allow to walk it wa
surround by a doubl wall with an outer and an inner moat the outer
dry and the inner fill with water there were doubl gate also and
by them guardtow moreov i see a littl yard with post in it
where prison were scourg and a small and horribl room furnish
with a kind of wooden bed to which thei were bound for the punish
of the put out of their ey and the slit of their tongu
in front of thi room wa a block where those condemn to death were
sometim execut
there were mani prison not common felon but peopl who had been
taken for reason of state or sometim of religion perhap in all thei
number a hundr men and with them a few women who had a quarter to
themselv besid the jailer threescor guard were station there
night and dai and of all of these i wa in command
befor i had held my offic three dai i found that iren had appoint
me to it with good reason it happen thu the most of the prison
were allow to receiv present of food and other thing sent to them
by their friend all these present were suppos to be inspect by
the offic in charg of the prison thi rule which had been much
neglect i enforc again with the result that i made some strang
discoveri
thu on the third dai there came a magnific offer of fig for
the csar and nobilissimi the brothersinlaw of iren and the
uncl of the young emperor constantin her son these fig were be
carri past me formal when someth about the appear of on of
them excit my suspicion i took it and offer it to the jailer who
carri the basket he look frighten shook hi head and said
gener i touch no fruit
inde i answer that is strang sinc i thought that i saw you
eat of it yesterdai
ay gener he repli the truth is that i at too much
make no answer i went to the window and threw the fig to a
longtail tame monkei which wa chain to a post in the yard
without it caught it and at greedili
do not go awai friend i said to the jailer who wa try to depart
while my back wa turn i have question that i would ask you
so i spoke to him about other matter and all the while watch the
monkei
soon i saw that it wa ill at eas it began to tear at it stomach and
to whimper like a child then it foam at the mouth wa seiz with
convuls and within a quarter of an hour by the waterclock wa
dead
it would seem that those fig ar poison friend i said and
therefor it is fortun for you that you at too much fruit yesterdai
now man what do you know of thi matter
noth sir he answer fall on hi knee i swear to you by
christ noth onli i doubt the fruit were brought by a woman
whom i thought that onc i had seen in the household of the augustu
constantin and i knew and he paus
well what did you know man it would be best to tell me quickli who
have power here
i knew sir what all the world know that constantin would be rid of
hi uncl whom he fear though thei ar maim no more i swear it
no more
perhap befor the augusta return you mai rememb someth more i
said therefor i will not judg your case at present ho guard come
hither
as he heard the soldier stir without in answer to my summon the
man who wa unarm look about hi desper then he sprang at
the fruit and seiz a fig strove to thrust it into hi mouth but
i wa too quick for him and within a few second the soldier had him
fast
shut thi man in a safe dungeon i said treat and feed him well but
search him see also that he doe himself no harm and that none speak
with him then forget all thi busi
what charg must be enter in the book gener ask the offic
salut
a charg of steal fig that belong to the csar nicephoru and hi
royal brethren i answer and look through the window
he follow my glanc saw the poor monkei ly dead and start
all shall be done he said and the man wa led awai
when he had gone i sent for the physician of the jail whom i knew to
be trustworthi sinc i had appoint him myself without tell him
anyth i bade him examin and preserv the fig and also dissect the
bodi of the monkei to discov why it di
he bow and went awai with the fruit a while later he return and
show me an open fig in the heart of it wa a pinch of white powder
what is it i ask
the deadliest poison that is known gener see the stalk ha been
drawn out the powder blown in through a straw and then the stalk
replac
ah i said that is clever but not quit clever enough thei have
mix the stalk i note that the purpl fig had the stalk of a green
fig and that is why i tri it on the monkei
you observ well gener
ye physician i observ i learn that when as a lad i hunt game
in the far north also i learn to keep silent sinc nois frighten
game do you as much
have no fear he answer and went about hi busi with the dead
monkei
when he had gone i thought a while then i rose and went to the chapel
of the prison or rather to a place whenc i could see those in the
chapel without be seen thi chapel wa situat in a gloomi crypt
light onli with oil lamp that hung from the massiv pillar and
arch the dai wa the sabbath of the christian and when i enter
the littl secret hollow in the wall the sacrament wa be
administ to certain of the prison
truli it wa a sad sight for the minist priest wa none other than
the csar nicephoru the eldest of the emperor uncl who had been
first ordain in order that he might be unfit to sit upon the throne
and afterward blind as i have told he wa a tall pale man with an
uncertain mouth and a littl point chin appar between forti and
fifti year of ag and hi face wa made dread by two red
hollow where the ey should have been yet notwithstand thi
disfigur and hi tonsur crown and the broider priest robe
which hung upon him awkwardli as he stumbl through the word of hi
offic to thi poor victim there still seem to cling some air of
royal birth and bear be blind he could not see to administ
the element and therefor hi hand wa guid by on of hi imperi
brethren who also had been made a priest the tongu of thi priest had
been slit but now and again he gibber some direct into the ear
of nicephoru by the altar watch all sat a sternfac monk the
confessor of the csar and of the nobilissimi who wa put there to
spy upon them
i follow the rite to it end observ these unhappi prison
seek from the mysteri of their faith the onli consol that
remain to them mani of them were men innoc of ani crime save that
of adher to some fallen caus polit or religi victim were
thei not sinner to be releas by death alon i rememb that as
the mean of the scene came home to me i recal the word of iren
who had said that she believ thi world to be a hell and found weight
in them at length abl to bear no more i left my hidingplac and
went into the garden behind the chapel here at least were natur
thing here flower tend by the prison bloom as thei might
have done in some less accurs spot here the free bird sang and
nest in the tree for what to them were the high surround wall
i sat myself down upon a seat in the shade present as i had
expect nicephoru the priestcsar and hi four brethren came into
the garden two of them led the blind man by the hand and the other two
clung close to him for all these unfortun love each other dearli
the four with the split tongu gabbl in hi ear now and again
when he could catch or guess at the mean of a word he answer the
speaker gentli or the other see that he had not understood them
aright painfulli tri to explain the error oh it wa a piteou thing
to see and hear my gorg rose against the young brute of an emperor
and hi councillor who for ambit sake had wrought thi horribl
crime littl did i know then that er long their fate would be hi own
and that a mother hand would deal it out to him
thei caught sight of me seat beneath the tree and chatter like
startl starl till at length nicephoru understood
what sai you dear brother he ask that the new governor of the
prison is seat yonder well why should we fear him he ha been here
but a littl while yet he ha shown himself veri kind to us moreov
he is a man of the north no treacher greek and the men of the north
ar brave and upright onc when i wa a free princ i had some of
them in my servic and i love them well our nephew the emperor
offer a larg sum to a northman to blind or murder me but he would
not do it and wa dismiss from the servic of the empir becaus he
spoke hi mind and prai hi heathen god to bring a like fate upon
constantin himself lead me to thi governor i would talk with him
so thei brought nicephoru to me though doubtfulli and when he wa
near i rose from my seat and salut him thereon thei all gabbl again
with their split tongu till at length he understood and flush with
pleasur
gener olaf he said to me i thank you for your courtesi to a poor
prison forgotten by god and cruelli oppress by man gener olaf
the promis is of littl worth but if ever it should be in my power i
will rememb thi kind which pleas me more than did the shout
of the legion in the short dai of my prosper
sir i answer whatev happen i shall rememb your word which
ar more to me than ani honour king can bestow now sir i will ask
your royal brethren to fall back as i wish to speak with you
nicephoru made a sign with hi hand and the four halfdumb men all of
whom resembl him strang especi in the weak of their mouth
and chin obei bow to me in a state fashion thei withdrew
leav us alon
sir i said i would warn you that you have enemi whom you mai not
suspect for my duti here wherewith i wa charg by the augusta is not
to oppress but to protect you and your imperi brother
then i told him the stori of the poison fig
when he had heard it the tear well from hi hollow ey and ran down
hi pale cheek
constantin my brother leo son ha done thi he said for never
will he rest until all of us ar in the grave
he is cruel becaus he fear you o nicephoru and it is said that
your ambit ha given him caus to fear
onc gener that wa true the princ repli onc foolishli i
did aspir to rule but it is long ago now thei have made a priest of
me and i seek peac onli can i and my brethren help it if mutil
though we ar some still wish to us us against the emperor i tell you
that iren herself is at the back of them she would set us on high that
afterward she mai throw us down and crush us
i am her servant princ and mai not listen to such talk who know
onli that she seek to protect you from your enemi and for that
reason ha place me here it seem not in vain if you would continu
to live i warn you and your brethren to fly from plot and to be
care of what you eat and drink
i do not desir to live gener he answer oh that i might die
would that i might die
death is not difficult to find princ i repli and left him
these mai seem hard word but be it rememb i wa no christian
then but a heathen man to see on who had been great and fallen from
hi great on whom fortun had desert utterli whine at fate
like a fret child and yet afraid to seek hi freedom move me to
contempt as well as to piti therefor i spoke the word
yet all the rest of that dai thei weigh upon my mind for i knew well
how i should have interpret them were i in thi poor csar place so
heavili did thei weigh that dure the follow night an impuls drew
me from my bed and caus me to visit the cell in which these princ
were imprison four of them were dark and silent but in that of
nicephoru burn a light i listen at the door and through the
keyplac heard that the prison within wa prai and sob as he
prai
then i went awai but when i reach the end of the long passag
someth drew me back again it wa as though a hand i could not see
were guid me i return to the door of the cell and now through it
heard choke sound quickli i shot the bolt and unlock it with my
masterkei thi wa what i saw within
to a bar of the windowplac wa fasten such a rope as monk wear for
a girdl at the end of the rope wa a noos and in that noos the head
of nicephoru there he hung struggl hi hand had grip the rope
abov hi head for though he had sought death at the last he tri to
escap him of such stuff wa nicephoru made yet it wa too late or
would have been for as i enter the place hi hand slip from the
thin cord which tighten round hi throat choke him
my sword wa at my side draw it with a blow i cut the rope and
caught him in my arm alreadi he wa swoon but i pour water over
hi face and as hi neck remain unbroken he recov hi breath
and sens
what plai is thi princ i ask
on that you taught me gener he answer painfulli you said that
death could be found i went to seek him but at the last i fear
oh i tell you that when i thrust awai that stool my blind ey were
open and i saw the fire of hell and the hand of devil grasp at
my soul to plung it into them bless be on you who have save me
from those fire and seiz my hand he kiss it
do not thank me i said but thank the god you worship for i think
that he must have put it into my mind to visit you tonight now swear
to me by that god that you will attempt such a deed no more for if you
will not swear then you must be fetter
then he swore so fervent by hi christ that i wa sure he would never
break the oath after he had sworn i told him how i could not rest
becaus of the strang fear which oppress me
oh he said without doubt it wa god who sent hi angel to you that
i might be save from the most dread of all sin without doubt it
wa god who know you although you do not know him
after thi he fell upon hi knee and have unti the cut rope from
the window bar i left him
now i tell thi stori becaus it ha to do with my own for it wa these
word of the princ that first turn me to the studi of the christian
faith inde had thei never been spoken i believ that i should have
live and di a heathen man hitherto i had judg of that faith by the
work of those who practis it in constantinopl and found it want
now howev i wa sure that some power from abov us had guid me
to the chamber of nicephoru in time to save hi life me who had he
di in a sens would have been guilti of hi blood for had he not
been driven to the deed by my bitter mock word it mai be said that
thi would have matter littl that he might as well have di by
hi own hand as be taken to athen there to perish with hi brethren
whether natur or by murder i do not know but who can judg of such
secret thing without doubt the suffer of nicephoru had a purpos
as have all our suffer he wa kept aliv for reason known to hi
maker though not to man
here i will add that of thi unhappi csar and hi brethren i rememb
littl more dimli i seem to recollect that dure my period of offic
some attack wa made upon the prison by those who would have put the
princ to death but that i discov the plot through the jailer who
had introduc the poison fig and defeat it with eas therebi
gain much credit with iren and her minist if so of thi plot
histori sai noth all it tell of these princ is that afterward
a mob hale them to the cathedr of st sophia and there proclaim
nicephoru emperor but thei were taken again and at last ship to
athen where thei vanish from the sight of men
god rest their tortur soul for thei were more sin against than
sin
chapter iii
mother and son
the next vision of thi byzantin life of mine that rise befor me is
that of a great round build crown with men clad in bishop robe
at least thei wore mitr and each of them had a crook pastor staff
which in most case wa carri by an attend monk
some debat wa in progress or rather rage it subject seem to be
as to whether imag should or should not be worship in church
it wa a furiou thing that debat on parti to it were call
iconoclast that wa the parti which did not like imag and i think
the other parti were call orthodox but of thi i am not sure so
furiou wa it that i the gener and governor of the prison had been
command by those in author to attend in order to prevent violenc
the begin of what happen i do not rememb what i do rememb
is that the antiiconoclast the parti to which the empress iren
belong that wa therefor the fashion sect be as it seem
to me worst in argument fell back on violenc
there follow a great tumult in which the spectat took part and
the strang sight wa seen of priest and their partisan and even of
bishop themselv fall upon their adversari and beat them with
whatev weapon wa to hand ye even with their pastor stave it
wa a wonder thing to behold these minist of the christ of peac
belabour each other with pastor stave
the parti that advoc the worship of imag wa the more numer
and had the greater number of adher and therefor those who thought
otherwis were defeat a few of them were drag out into the
street and kill by the mob which wait there and more were wound
notwithstand all that i and the guard could do to protect them
among the iconoclast wa a gentlefac old man with a long beard on
of the bishop from egypt who wa name barnaba he had said littl in
the debat which last for sever dai and when he spoke hi word
were full of chariti and kind still the imag faction hate him
and when the final tumult began some of them set upon him inde
on brawni darkfac bishopi think it wa he of antiochrush at
barnaba and befor i could thrust him back broke a jewel staff
upon hi head while other priest tore hi robe from neck to shoulder
and spat in hi face
at last the riot wa quell the dead were born awai and order came
to me that i wa to convei barnaba to the state prison if he still
live togeth with some other of whom i rememb noth so thither
i took barnaba and there with the help of the prison physicianh to
whom i had given the poison fig and the dead monkei to be examinedi
nurs him back to life and health
hi ill wa long for on of the blow which he had receiv
crippl him and dure it we talk much togeth he wa a veri
sweetnatur man and holi a nativ of britain whose father or
grandfath had been a dane and therefor there wa a tie between us
in hi youth he wa a soldier have been taken prison in some war
he came to itali where he wa ordain a priest at rome afterward he
wa sent as a missionari to egypt where he wa appoint the head of
a monasteri and in the end elect to a bishopr but he had never
forgotten the danish tongu which hi parent taught him as a child
and so we were abl to talk togeth in that languag
now it would seem that sinc that night when the csar nicephoru strove
to hang himself i had obtain and studi a copi of the christian
scriptureshow i do not knowand therefor wa abl to discuss these
matter with barnaba the bishop of our argument i rememb noth
save that i point out to him that wherea the tree seem to me to be
veri good it fruit were vile beyond imagin and i instanc the
horribl tumult when he had been wound almost to death not by common
men but by the veri leader of the christian
he answer that these thing must happen that christ himself had said
he came to bring not peac but a sword and that onli through war and
struggl would the last truth be reach the spirit wa alwai good
he ad but the flesh wa alwai vile these deed were those of the
flesh which pass awai but the spirit remain pure and immort
the end of it wa that under the teach of the holi barnaba saint
and martyr for afterward he wa murder by the follow of the fals
prophet mahomet i becam a christian and a new man now at length i
understood what grace it wa that had given me courag to offer battl
to the heathen god odin and to smite him down now i saw also where
shone the light which i had been seek these mani year ay and i
clasp that light to my bosom to be my lamp in life and death
so a dai came when my belov master barnaba who would allow no
delai in thi matter baptis me in hi cell with water taken from hi
drink vessel charg me to make public profess befor the church
when opportun should aris
it wa just at thi time that iren return from the bath and i sent
to her a written report of all that had happen at the prison sinc i
had been appoint it governor also i prai that if it were her will
i might be reliev of my offic as it wa on which did not pleas me
a few dai later while i sat in my chamber at the prison write
a paper concern a prison who had di the porter at the gate
announc that a messeng from the augusta wish to see me i bade
him show in the messeng and present there enter no chamberlain or
eunuch but a woman wrap in a dark cloak when the man had gone and
the door wa shut she threw off the cloak and i saw that my visitor
wa martina the favourit waitingladi of the empress we greet each
other warmli who were alwai friend and i ask her tide
my tide ar olaf that the water have suit the augusta veri
well she ha lost sever pound in weight and her skin is now like
that of a young child
all health to the augusta i said laugh but you have not come
here to tell me of the state of the royal skin what next martina
thi olaf the empress ha read your report with her own ey which
is a rare thing for her to do she said she wish to see whether or
no you could write greek she is much pleas with the report and told
stauraciu in my presenc that she had done well in choos you for
your offic while she wa absent from the citi sinc therebi she had
save the live of the csar and nobilissimi desir as she doe
that these princ should be kept aliv at ani rate for the present
she acced also to your prayer and will reliev you of your offic
as soon as a new governor can be chosen you ar to return to guard her
person but with your rank of gener confirm
that is all good new martina so good that i wonder what sting is
hidden in all thi honei
that you will find out present olaf on i can warn you of
howeverth sting of jealousi advanc such as your draw ey to
you not all of them in love
i nod and she went on
meantim your star seem to shine veri bright inde on might almost
sai that the augusta worship it at least she talk of you to me
continu and onc or twice wa in half a mind to send for you to the
bath inde had it not been for reason of state connect with your
prison i think she would have done so
ah i said now i think i begin to feel anoth sting in the honei
anoth sting in the honei nai nai you mean a divin perfum an
essenc of ad sweet a flavour of the flower on mount ida why
olaf if i were your enemi as i dare sai i shall be some dai for often
we learn to hate those whom we haverath like your head and your
shoulder might bid goodby to each other for such word as those
perhap martina and if thei did i do not know that it would greatli
matternow
not greatli matter when you ar drive at full gallop along fortun
road to fame templ with an empress for your chariot ar you
blind or mad olaf or both and what do you mean by your now olaf
someth ha happen to you sinc last we met have you fallen in love
with some fair prison in thi hate place and been repuls such a
fool as you ar might take refus even from a captiv in hi own hand
at least you ar differ
ye martina someth ha happen to me i have becom a christian
oh olaf now i see that you ar not a fool as i thought but veri
clever why onli yesterdai the augusta said to meit wa after she had
read that report of yoursthat if you were but a christian she would be
mind to lift you high inde but as you remain the most obstin
of heathen she did not see how it could be done without caus great
troubl
now i wish on could be a christian within and remain a pagan without
i answer grimli though ala that mai not be martina do you not
understand that it wa for no such reason as these that i kiss the
cross that in so do i sought not fortun but to be it servant
by the saint youll be tonsur next and ill enough it would suit
you she exclaim rememb if thing grow toodifficult you can
alwai be tonsur olaf onli then you will have to give up the hope
of that ladi who wear the other half of the necklac somewher i
dont mean iren sham half but the real on oh stop blush and
stammer i know the stori and all about iduna the fair also an
exalt person told it me and so did you although you were not awar
that you had done so for you ar not on who can keep a secret to
himself mai all the guardian angel help that necklaceladi if ever she
should meet anoth ladi whom i will not name and now why do you talk
so much ar you learn to preach or what if you realli do mean to
becom a monk olaf there is anoth thing you must give up and that
is war except of the kind which you saw at the council the other dai
god abov us what a sight it would be to see you batter anoth
bishop with a hookshap staff over a question of imag or the two
natur i should be sorri for that bishop but you havent told me who
convert you
barnaba of egypt i said
oh i hope that it had been a ladi saint the stori would have been so
much more interest to the court well our imperi mistress doe not
like barnaba becaus he doe not like imag and that mai be a sting
in her honei but perhap she will forgiv him for your sake youll
have to worship imag
what do i care about imag it is the spirit that i seek martina and
all these thing ar noth
you ar thorough as usual olaf and jump farther than you can see
well be advis and sai naught for or against imag as thei have no
mean for you what can it matter if thei ar or ar not there leav
them to the blind ey and littl mind and now i must be gone who
can listen to your gossip no longer oh i had forgotten my messag
the augusta command that you shall wait on her thi even immedi
after she ha sup hear and obei
have deliv thi formal mandat to neglect which meant
imprison or wors she threw her cloak about her and with a
wonder glanc at my face open the door and went
at the hour appoint or rather somewhat befor it i attend at the
privat apart of the palac evid i wa expect for on of
the chamberlain on see me bow and bade me be seat then left
the anteroom present the door open again and through it came
martina clad in her white offici robe
you ar earli olaf she said like a lover who keep a tryst well
it is alwai wise to meet good fortun half wai but why do you come
clad in full armour it is not the custom to wait thu upon the empress
at thi hour when you ar off duti
i thought that i wa on duti martina
then as usual you thought wrong take off that armour she sai that
the sight of it alwai make her feel cold after supper i sai take it
off or if you cannot i will help you
so the mail wa remov leav me clad in my plain blue tunic and
hose
would you have me come befor the empress thu i ask
by wai of answer she clap her hand and bade the eunuch who answer
the signal to bring a certain robe he went and present reappear
with a wondrou garment of silk broider with gold such as nobl of
high rank wore at festiv thi robe which fit as though it
had been made for me i put on though i like the look of it littl
martina would have had me even remov my sword but i refus sai
except at the express order of the empress i and my sword ar not
part
well she said noth about the sword olaf so let it be all she
said wa that i must be care that the robe match the colour of the
necklac you wear she cannot bear colour which jar upon each other
especi by lamplight
am i a man i ask angrili or a beast be deck for sacrific
fie olaf have you not yet forgotten your heathen talk rememb i
prai you that you ar now a christian in a christian land
i thank you for remind me of it i repli and that moment a
chamberlain enter hurriedli command my presenc
good luck to you olaf said martina as i follow him be sure to
tell me the new lateror tomorrow
then the chamberlain led me not into the audienc hall as i had
expect but to the privat imperi dine chamber here reclin
upon couch in the old roman fashion on on either side of a narrow
tabl on which stood fruit and flagon of richhu greek wine were
the two greatest peopl in the world the augusta iren and the augustu
constantin her son
she wa wonderfulli apparel in a lowcut garment of white silk over
which fell a mantl of the imperi purpl and i note that on her
dazzl bosom hung that necklac of emerald beetl separ by golden
shell which she had caus to be copi from my own on her fair hair
that grew low upon her forehead and wa part in the middl she wore
a diadem of gold in which were set emerald to match the beetl of the
necklac the augustu wa arrai in the festal garment of a csar
also cover with a purpl cloak he wa a heavyfac and somewhat
stupidlook youth darkhair like hi father and uncl but
have larg blue and not unkindli ey from hi flush face i
gather that he had drunk well of the strong greek wine and from the
sullen look about hi mouth that as wa common he had been quarrel
with hi mother
i stood at the end of the tabl and salut first the empress and then
the emperor
who thi he ask glanc at me
gener olaf of my guard she answer governor of the state
prison you rememb you wish me to send for him to settl the point
as to which we were argu
oh ye well gener olaf of my mother guard have you not been
told that you should salut the augustu befor the augusta
sire i answer humbl i have heard noth of that matter but in
the land where i wa bred i wa taught that if a man and a woman were
togeth i must alwai bow first to the woman and then to the man
well said exclaim the empress clap her hand but the emperor
answer doubtless your mother taught you that not your father next
time you enter the imperi chamber be pleas to forget the lesson and
to rememb that emperor and empress ar not men and women
sire i answer as you command i will rememb that emperor and
empress ar not men and women but emperor and empress
at these word the augustu began to scowl but chang hi mind
laugh as did hi mother he fill a gold cup with wine and push it
toward me sai
drink to us soldier for after you have done so our wit mai be
better match
i took the cup and hold it said
i pledg your imperi majesti who shine upon the world like twin
star in the sky all hail to your majesti and i drank but not too
deep
you ar clever growl the augustu well keep the cup youv
earn it yet drain it first man you have scarc wet your lip do
you fear that it is poison as you sai yonder fruit ar and he
point to a sidet where stood a jar of glass in which were those
veri fig that had been sent to the princ in the prison
the cup you give is mine interrupt iren still my servant is
welcom to the gift it shall be sent to your quarter gener
a soldier ha no need of such gaud your majesti i began when
constantin who while we spoke had swallow anoth draught of the
strong wine broke in angrili
mai i not give a cup of gold but you must claim it i to whom the
empir and all it wealth belong
snatch up the beaker he dash it to the floor spill the wine of
which i who wish to keep my head cool wa glad
have done he went on in hi drunken rage shall the csar huckster
over a piec of work gold like jew in a market give me those fig
man ill settl the matter of thi poison
i brought the jar of fig and bow set them down befor him that
thei were the same i knew for the glass wa label in my own write
and in that of the physician he cut awai the seal parchment which wa
stretch over the mouth of the jar
now hearken you olaf he said it is true that i order fruit to
be sent to that foolcsar my uncl becaus the last time i saw him
nicephoru prai me for it and i wa will to do him a pleasur but
that i order the fruit to be poison as my mother sai is a lie
and mai god curs the tongu that spoke it i will show you that it wa
a lie and plung hi hand into the spirit of the jar he drew out
two of the fig now he went on wave them about in a halfdrunken
fashion thi gener olaf of your sai that these ar the same
fig which were sent to the csar i mean the blind priest father
nicephoru dont you olaf
ye sire i answer thei were place in that bottl in my presenc
and seal with my seal
well those fig were sent by me and thi olaf tell us thei ar
poison ill show him and you too mother that thei ar not
poison for i will eat on of them
now i look at the augusta but she sat silent her arm fold on her
white bosom her handsom face turn as it were to stone
constantin lift the fig toward hi loos mouth again i look at
the augusta still she sat there like a statu and it came into my mind
that it wa her purpos to allow thi winebemus man to eat the fig
then i act
augustu i said you must not touch that fruit and step
forward i took it from hi hand
he sprang to hi feet and began to revil me
you watchdog of the north he shout do you dare to sai to the
emperor that he shall not do thi or that by all the imag my mother
worship ill have you whip through the circu
that you will never do i answer for my free blood boil at the
insult i tell you sire i went on leav out certain word which i
meant to speak that the fig is poison
and i tell you that you lie you heathen savag see here either you
eat that fig or i do so that we mai know who speak the truth if you
wont i will now obei or by christ tomorrow you shall be shorter
by a head
the augustu is pleas to threaten which is unnecessari i remark
if i eat the fig will the augustu swear to leav the rest of them
uneaten
ay he answer with a hiccough for then i shall know the truth
and for the truth i live though he ad i havent found it yet
and if i do not eat it will the augustu do so
by the holi blood ye ill eat a dozen of them am i on to be
hector by a woman and a barbarian eat or i eat
good sire it is better that a barbarian should die than that the
world should lose it gloriou emperor i eat and when you ar as i
soon shall be as will happen even to an emperor mai my blood lie heavi
on your soul the blood which i give to save your life
then i lift the fig to my lip
befor ever it touch them with a motion swift as that of a panther
spring on it prei iren had leapt from her couch and dash the
fruit from my hand she turn upon her son
what kind of a thing ar you she ask who would suffer a brave man
to poison himself that he mai save your worthless life oh god what
have i done that i should have given birth to such a hound whoever
poison them these fruit ar poison as ha been prove and can be
prove again ye and shall be i tell you that if olaf had tast on
of them by now he would have been dead or dy
constantin drank anoth cup of wine which oddli enough seem to
sober him for the moment
i find all thi strang he said heavili you my mother would
have suffer me to eat the fig which you declar is poison a matter
whereof you mai know someth but when the gener olaf offer to eat
it in my place with your own royal hand you dash it from hi lip as
he dash it from mine and there is anoth thing which is still more
strang thi olaf who also sai the fig ar poison offer to
eat on of them if i promis i would not do so which mean if he
is right that he offer to give hi life for mine yet i have done
noth for him except call him hard name and as he is your servant
he ha noth to look for from me if i should win the fight with you at
last now i have heard much talk of miracl but thi is the onli on i
have ever seen either olaf is a liar or he is a great man and a saint
he sai i am told that the monkei which at on of those fig di
well i never thought of it befor but there ar more monkei in the
palac inde on live on the terrac near by for i fed it thi
afternoon well put the matter to the proof and learn of what stuff
thi olaf is realli made
on the tabl stood a silver bell and as he spoke he struck it a
chamberlain enter and wa order to bring in the monkei he depart
and with incred swift the beast and it keeper arriv it wa
a larg anim of the baboon tribe famou throughout the palac for it
trick inde on enter at a word from the man who led it it bow
to all of us
give your beast these said the emperor hand the keeper sever of
the fig
the baboon took the fruit and have snif at them put them
asid then the keeper fed it with some sweetmeat which it caught and
devour and present when it fear were allai threw it on
of the fig which it swallow doubtless think it a sweetmeat
a minut or two later it began to show sign of distress and shortli
afterward di in convuls
now said iren now do you believ my son
ye he answer i believ that there is a saint in constantinopl
sir saint i salut you you have save my life and if it should come
my wai by your brother saint ill save your although you ar my
mother servant
so speak he drank off yet anoth cup of wine and reel from the
room
the keeper at a sign from iren lift up the bodi of the dead ap and
also left the chamber weep as he went for he had love thi beast
chapter iv
olaf offer hi sword
the emperor had gone drunk the ap had gone dead and it keeper had
gone weep iren and i alon were left in that beauti place with
the winestain tabl on which stood the jar of poison fig and the
bent golden cup ly on the marbl floor
she sat upon the couch look at me with a kind of amaz in her
ey and i stood befor her at attent as doe a soldier on duti
i wonder why he did not send for on of my servant to eat those
figsstauraciu for instanc she muse ad with a littl laugh
well if he had there ar some whom i could have spare better than
that poor ap which at time i us to feed it wa an honest creatur
that ap the onli creatur in the palac that would not rub it head
in the dust befor the augusta ah now i rememb it alwai hate
constantin for when he wa a child he us to teas it with a stick
get beyond the length of it chain and strike it but on dai as
he pass too near it caught him and buffet him on the cheek and tore
out some of hi hair he want to kill it then but i forbad him yet
he ha never forgotten it he who never doe forget anyth he hate
and that is why he sent for the poor beast
the augusta will rememb that the augustu did not know that the fig
were poison
the augusta is sure that the augustu knew well enough that those fig
were poison at ani rate from the moment that i dash on of them
from your lip olaf well i have made a bitter enemi than befor
that all thei sai that by natur rule mother and child must love
each other but it is a lie i tell you it a lie from the time he wa
tini i hate that boi though not half as much as he ha hate me you
ar think to yourself that thi is becaus our ambit clash like
meet sword and that from them spring these fire of hate it is not
so the hate is nativ to our heart and will onli end when on of us
li dead at the other hand
terribl word augusta
ye but true truth is alwai terriblein byzantium olaf take those
drug fruit and set them in the drawer of yonder tabl lock it and
guard the kei lest thei should poison other honest anim
i obei and return to my station
she look at me and said
i grow weari of the sight of you stand there like a statu of the
roman mar with your sword half hid beneath your cloak and what
more i hate thi hall it reek of constantin and hi drink and li
oh he vile and for my sin god ha made me hi mother unless
inde he wa chang at birth as iv been told though i could never
prove it give me your hand and help me to rise so i thank you now
follow me well sit a while in my privat chamber where alon i can be
happi sinc the emperor never come there nai talk not of duti
you have no guard to set or chang tonight follow me i have secret
busi of which i would talk with you
so she went and i follow through door that open mysteri at
our approach and shut mysteri behind us till i found myself in a
littl room halflight onli that i had never seen befor it wa a
scent and a beauti place in on corner of which a white statu
gleam that of a venu kiss cupid who fold on wing about her
head and through the open windowplac the moonlight shone and float
the murmur of the sea
the doubl door were shut for aught i knew lock and with her own
hand iren drew the curtain over them near the open window to which
there wa no balconi stood a couch
sit yonder olaf she said for here there is no ceremoni here we
ar but man and woman
i obei while she busi herself with the curtain then she came and
sat herself down on the couch also lean against the end of it in
such a fashion that she could watch me in the moonlight
olaf she said after she had look at me a while rather strang
as i thought for the colour came and went upon her face which in that
light seem quit young again and wonderfulli beauti olaf you ar
a veri brave man
there ar hundr in your servic braver empress coward do not take
to soldier
i could tell you a differ stori olaf but it wa not of thi kind
of courag that i talk it wa of that which made you offer to eat
the poison fig in place of constantin why did you do so it is true
that as thing have happen hell rememb it in your favour for
ill sai thi of him he never forget on who ha save him from harm
ani more than he forget on who ha harm him but if you had eaten
you would have di and then how could he have reward you
empress when i took my oath of offic i swore to protect both the
augustu and the augusta even with my life i wa fulfil my oath
that is all
you ar a strang man as well as a brave man to interpret oath so
strictli if you will do as much as thi for on who is noth to you
and who ha never paid you a gold piec how much i wonder would you
do for on whom you love
i could offer no more than my life for such a on empress could i
someon told meit mai have been you olaf or anotherthat onc you
did more challeng a heathen god for the sake of on you love and
defeat him it wa ad that thi wa for a man but that i do not
believ doubtless it wa for the sake of iduna the fair of whom you
have spoken to me whom it seem you cannot forget although she wa
faithless to you it is said that the best wai to hold love is to
be faithless to him who love and in truth i believ it she ad
bitterli
you ar mistaken empress it wa to be aveng on him for the life
of steinar my fosterbroth which he had taken in sacrific that
i dare odin and hew hi holi statu to piec with thi sword of
steinar whom iduna betrai as she betrai me bring on to death
and the other to shame
at least had it not been for thi iduna you would never have given
battl to the great god of the north and thu brought hi curs upon
you for olaf those god live thei ar devil
whether odin is or is not i do not fear hi curs empress
yet it will find you out befor all is done or so i think look you
pagan blood still run in me and christian though i am i would not
dare on of the great god of greec and rome id leav that to the
priest do you fear noth olaf
i think noth at all sinc i hew off odin head and came awai
unscath
then you ar a man to my like olaf
she paus look at me even more strang than befor till i turn
my ey inde and stare out at the sea wish that i were in it
or anywher awai from thi love and imperi woman whom i wa sworn
to obei in all thing
olaf she said present you have serv me well of late is there
ani reward that you would ask and if so what anyth that i can give
is your unless she ad hastili the gift will take you awai from
constantinopl and fromm
ye augusta i answer still stare out at the sea in the prison
yonder is an old bishop name barnaba of egypt who wa set upon by
other bishop at the council while you were awai and wellnigh beaten
to death i ask that he mai be freed and restor to hi dioces with
honour
barnaba she repli sharpli i know the man he is an iconoclast
and therefor my enemi onli thi morn i sign an order that he
should be kept in confin till he di here or elsewher still
she went on though i would sooner give you a provinc have your gift
for i can refus you noth barnaba shall be freed and restor to
hi see with honour i have said
now i began to thank her but she stop me sai
have done anoth time you can talk to me of heret with whom you
have made friend but i who hear enough of such would have no more of
them tonight
so i grew silent and still stare out at the sea inde i wa
wonder in my mind whether i dare ask leav to depart for i felt her
ey burn on me and grew much afraid suddenli i heard a sound a
gentl sound of rustl silk and in anoth instant i felt iren
arm clasp about me and iren head laid upon my knee ye she wa
kneel befor me sob and her proud head wa rest on my knee
the diadem she wore had fallen from it and her tress break loos
flow to the ground and lai there gleam like gold in the moonlight
she look up and her face wa that of a weep saint
dost understand she whisper
now despair took me which i knew full well would soon be follow by
mad then came a thought
ye i said hoars i understand that you griev over that matter
of the augustu and the poison fig and would prai me to keep
silenc have no fear my lip ar seal but for hi i cannot answer
though perhap as he had drunk so much
fool she whisper is it thu that an empress plead with her
captain to keep silenc then she drew herself up a wonder look
upon her face that had grown suddenli white a fire in her upturn
ey and for the second time kiss me upon the lip
i took her in my arm and kiss her back for an instant my mind swam
then in my soul i cri for help and strength came to me rise i
lift her as though she were a child and stood her on her feet i
said
hearken empress befor destruct fall i do understand now though
a moment ago i did not who never thought it possibl that the queen of
the world could look with favour upon on so humbl
love take no account of rank she murmur and that kiss of your
upon my lip is more to me than the empir of the world
yet hearken i answer there is anoth wall between us which mai
not be climb
man what is thi wall is it name woman ar you sworn to the memori
of that iduna who is more fair than i or is it perchanc her of the
necklac
neither iduna is dead to me she of the necklac is but a dream
the wall is that of your own faith on thi night seven dai ago i wa
baptis a christian
well what of it thi draw us nearer
studi the sai of your sacr book empress and you will find that
it thrust us apart
now she colour to her hair and a kind of mad took her
am i to be preach to by you she ask
i preach to myself augusta who need it greatli not to you who
mayhap do not need it
hate me as you do why should you need it you ar the worst of
hypocrit who would veil your hate under a priest robe
have you no piti iren when did i sai that i hate you moreov if
i had hate you should i and i ceas
i do not know what you would or would not have done she answer
coldli i think that constantin is right and that you must be what is
call a saint and if so saint ar best in heaven especi when
thei know too much on earth give me that sword of your
i drew the sword salut with it and gave it to her
it is a heavi weapon she said whenc came it
from the same grave as the necklac augusta
ah the necklac that your dreamwoman wore well go to seek her in
the land of dream and she lift the sword
your pardon augusta but you ar about to strike with the blunt edg
which mai wound but will not kill
she laugh a littl veri nervous and turn the sword round in
her hand said
truli you ar the strangest of men ah i thank you now i have it
right do you understand olaf i mean sir saint what sort of a stori
i must tell of you after i have struck do you understand that not onli
ar you about to die but that infami will be pour upon your name and
that your bodi will be drag through the street and thrown to the
dog with the citi offal answer i sai answer
i understand that you must caus these thing to be done for your own
sake augusta and i do not complain li matter noth to me who
journei to the land of truth where there ar some whom i would meet
again be advis by me strike here where the neck join the shoulder
hold the sword slantwis for there even a woman blow will serv to
sever the great arteri
i cannot kill yourself olaf
a week ago id have fallen on the sword but now by the rule of our
faith in such a caus i mai not my blood must be upon your hand for
which i griev know that no other road is open to you augusta if
it is worth anyth to you take my full forgiv for the deed and
with it my thank for all the good you have shown to me but most
for your woman favour in after year perhap when death draw near
to you also if ever you rememb olaf your faith servant you will
understand much it is not fit that i should sai give me on moment
to make my peac with heaven as to certain kiss then strike hard and
swiftli and as you strike scream for your guard and women your wit
will do the rest
she lift the sword while after a moment prayer i bare my neck of
the silk robe then she let it fall again gasp and said
tell me first for i am curiou ar you no man or have you forsworn
woman as do the monk
not i augusta had i live some dai i might have marri who would
have wish to leav children behind me sinc in our law marriag is
allow forget not your promis as to the bishop barnaba who i fear
will weep over thi seem fall of mine
so you would marri would you she said as on who speak to herself
then thought awhil and hand me back the sword
olaf she went on you have made me feel as i never felt
beforeasham utterli asham and though i learn to hate you as it
well mai hap i shall know that i shall alwai honour you
then she sank down upon the couch and hide her face in her hand
wept bitterli
it wa at thi moment that i went veri near to love iren
i think she must have felt someth of what wa pass in my mind for
suddenli she look up and said give me that jewel and she point
to the diadem on the floor and help me to order my hair my hand
shake
nai i said as i gave her the crown of that wine i drink no more i
dare not touch you you grow too dear
for those word she whisper go in safeti and rememb that from
iren you have naught to fear as i know well i have naught to fear from
you o princ among men

you do not seem as pleas as you might be olaf tell me now at what
hour did you leav the palac last night while wait for my mistress
to summon me i fell asleep in the vestibul of the anteroom and when i
awok and went into that room i found there the goldbroid silk robe
you wore cast upon the ground and your armour gone
i know not what wa the hour martina and speak no more to me i prai
of that accurs womanish robe
which you treat but ill olaf for it is spot as though with
blood
the augustu spilt some wine over it

have eaten the poison fig which you snatch from the lip of
constantin
and what els did your mistress tell you martina
not much olaf she wa in a veri strang mood last night and while i
comb her hair which olaf wa as tangl as though a man had handl
it and she look at me till i colour to the ey and undid her
diadem that wa set on it all awri she spoke to me of marriag
of marriag i gasp
certainlydid i not speak the word with clearnessof marriag
with whom martina
oh grow not jealou befor there is need olaf she made no mention of
the name of our futur divin master for whosoev can rule iren if
such a on live will certainli rule us also all she said wa that she
wish she could find some man to guid guard and comfort her who grew
lone amidst mani troubl and hope for more son than constantin
what sort of a man martina thi emperor charlemagn or some other
king
no she vow that she had seen enough of princ who were murder
and liar all of them and that what she desir wa on of good birth
no more brave honest and not a fool i ask her too what she would
have him like to look upon
and what did she sai to that martina
oh she said that he must be tall and under forti fairhair and
beard sinc she love not these shaven effemin who look half
woman and half priest on who had known war and yet wa no ruffler a
person of open mind who had learnt and could learn more well now that
i think of it by all the saintsy much such a man as you ar
olaf
then she mai find them in plenti i said with an uneasi laugh
do you think so well she did not neither did i inde she point
out that thi wa her troubl among the great of the earth she knew no
such man and if she sought lower then would come jealousi and war
inde thei would doubtless you show her that thi wa so martina
not at all olaf i ask her of what us it wa to be an empress if
she could not pleas her own heart in thi matter of a husband which is
on import to a woman i said also as for such fear that a secret
marriag might be thought of which is an honest busi that could be
declar when occas came
and what did she answer to that martina
she fell into high good humour call me a faith and a clever
friend gave me a handsom jewel told me that she would have a mission
for me on the morrowdoubtless that which i now fulfil for i have
heard of no othersaid notwithstand all the troubl as to the
augustu and hi threat that she wa sure she would sleep better than
she had done for night kiss me on both cheek and flung herself
upon her knee at her prayingstool where i left her but why ar you

hand stare me full in the face with her quick ey that pierc like
nail

fix thereon and follow it and never think about the pitfal it mai

then she began to make a laugh of me to the paint throng about her
sai nobl and ladi she said did ani of you ever see such a man
we address him as best we mayand we have reason to believ that he
understand our languageyet not on word doe he vouchsaf to us
in answer there he stand like a soldier cut in iron who move by
spring with never an i thank you or a good dai on hi lip
doubtless he would reprov us all who he hold talk too much be
as we all have heard a man of stern moral who ha no tender for
human foibl by the wai gener olaf a rumour ha reach us that
you have forsaken doubt and becom a christian is thi true
it is true augusta
then if as a pagan you were a man of iron what will you be as a
christian we wonder on hard as diamond no less yet we ar glad
of thi tide as all good servant of the church must be sinc
henceforth our friendship will be closer and we valu you gener you
must be receiv publicli into the bosom of the faith it will be an
encourag to other to follow your exampl perhap as you have
serv us so well in mani war and as an offic of our guard we
ourselv will be your godmoth the matter shall be consid by us
what have you to answer to it
noth i repli save that when the augusta ha consid of the
matter i will consid of my answer
at thi the courtier titter and instead of grow angri as i
thought she might iren burst out laugh
truli we were wrong she said to provok you to open your mouth
gener for when you do so like that red sword you wear your tongu
is sharp if somewhat heavi tell us gener ar your new quarter to
your tast and befor you repli know that we inspect them ourselv
and have a like for such task attend to their furnish ti
done you will see in the northern style which we think somewhat cold
and heavylik your sword and tongu
if the augusta ask me i said the quarter ar too fine for a
singl soldier the two room where i dwelt befor were suffici
a singl soldier well that is a fault which can be remedi you
should marri gener olaf
when i find ani woman who wish to marri me and whom i wish to marri
i will obei the augusta command
so be it gener onli rememb that first we must approv the ladi
ventur not gener to share those new quarter of your with ani ladi
whom we do not approv
then follow by the court she turn and walk awai and i went
about my busi wonder what wa the mean of all thi guard
and halfbitt talk
the next event that return to me clearli is that of my public
accept as a christian in the great cathedr of st sophia which
must have taken place not veri long after thi meet upon the terrac
i know that by everi mean in my power i had striven though without
avail to escap thi ceremoni point out that i could be publicli
receiv into the bodi of the church at ani chapel where there wa a
priest and a congreg of a dozen humbl folk but thi the empress
would not allow the reason she gave wa her desir that my convers
should be proclaim throughout the citi that other pagan of whom
there were thousand might follow my exampl yet i think she had
anoth which she did not avow it wa that i might be made known in
public as a man of import whom it pleas her to honour
on the morn of thi rite martina came to acquaint me with it
detail and told me that the empress would be present at the cathedr
in state make her progress thither in her golden chariot drawn by
the fame milkwhit steed i it seem wa to ride after the chariot
in my gener uniform which wa splendid enough follow by a
compani of guard and surround by chant priest the patriarch
himself no less a person wa to receiv me and some other convert
and the cathedr would be fill with all the great on of
constantinopl
i ask whether iren intend to be my godmoth as she had
threaten
not so repli martina on that point she ha chang her mind
so much the better i said but why
there is a canon of the church olaf which forbid intermarriag
between a godpar and hi or her godchild she repli dryli
whether thi canon ha come to the augusta memori or not i cannot
sai it mai be so
who then is to be my godmoth i ask hurriedli leav the
problem of iren motiv undiscuss
i am by the written imperi decre deliv to me not an hour ago
you martina you who ar younger than myself by mani year
ye i the augusta ha just explain to me that as we seem to be such
veri good friend and to talk togeth so much alon doubtless
she suppos upon matter of religion there could be no person more
suitabl than such a good christian as myself to fill that holi offic
what do you mean martina i ask bluntli
i mean olaf she repli turn awai her head and speak in a
strain voic that where you ar concern the augusta of late ha
done me the honour to be somewhat jealou of me well of a godmoth
no on need be jealou the augusta is a clever woman olaf
i do not quit understand i said why should the augusta be jealou
of you
there is no reason at all olaf except that as it happen she is
jealou of everi woman who come near to you and she know that we ar
intim and that you trust mewel more perhap than you trust her
oh i assur you that of late you have not spoken to ani woman under
fifti unnot and unreport mani ey watch you olaf
then thei might find better employ but tell me outright martina
what is the mean of all thi
sure even a woodenhead northman can guess olaf
she glanc round her to make sure that we were alon in the great
apart of my quarter and that the door were shut then went on
almost in a whisper my mistress is wonder whether or no she will
marri again and if so whether she will choos a certain somewhat
overvirtu christian soldier as a second husband as yet she ha not
made up her mind moreov even if she had noth could be done at
present or until the question of the struggl between her and her son
for power is settl in thi wai or in that therefor at worst or
at best that soldier ha yet a while of singl life left to him sai a
month or two
then dure that month or two perhap he would be wise to travel i
suggest
perhap if he were a fool who would run awai from fortun and if he
could get leav of absenc which in hi case is imposs to attempt
such a journei without it would mean hi death no if he is wise that
soldier will bide where he is and await event possess hi soul in
patienc as a good christian should do now as your godmoth i must
instruct you in thi servic look not so troubl it is realli most
simpl you know stauraciu the eunuch is to be your godfath which
is veri fortun for you sinc although he look on you with doubt
and jealousi to blind or murder hi own godson would caus too much
scandal even in constantinopl as a special mark of grace also the
bishop barnaba of egypt will be allow to assist in the ceremoni
becaus it wa he who snatch your soul from the burn moreov
sinc the sacrament is to be administ afterward he ha been
command to attend here to receiv your confess in the chapel of the
palac and within an hour you know that thi dai be the feast of
st michael and all angel you will be receiv in the name of michael
a high on well fit to a warlik saint though i think that i shall
still call you olaf so farewel my godson to be until we meet at
the cathedr where i shall shine in the reflect light of all your
virtu
then she sigh laugh a littl and glide awai
in due cours a priest of the chapel came to summon me there sai
that the bishop barnaba await me i went and made my confess
though in truth i had littl to tell him that he did not alreadi know
afterward the good old man who by now wa quit recov from hi
hurt and imprison accompani me to my quarter where we at
togeth he told me that befor he attend in the chapel he had been
receiv by the empress who had spoken to him veri kindli make
light of their differ of opinion as to imag and with her own mouth
confirm him in hi bishopr even hint at hi possibl promot
thi my son he ad i am well awar i ow to your good offic
i ask him if he would return at onc to upper egypt where he had hi
bishopr
no my son he answer not yet awhil the truth is that there
have arriv here the chief man in my dioces and hi daughter he is
a descend of the old pharaoh of the egyptian who live near the
second cataract of the nile almost on the border of ethiopia whither
the accurs children of mahomet have not yet forc their wai he is
still a great man among the egyptian who look upon him as their law
princ hi mission here is to try to plan a new war upon the follow
of the prophet who he hold might be assail by the empir at the
mouth of the nile while he attack them with hi egyptian from the
south
now i grew interest who had alwai griev over the loss of egypt to
the empir and ask what wa thi princ name
maga my son and hi daughter is name heliodor ah she is such a
woman as i would see you wed beauti inde and good and true as she
is beauti with a high spirit also such as befit her ancient blood
mayhap you will note her in the cathedr nai i forgot not there but
afterward in thi palac sinc it is the command of the empress to
whom i have been speak of their matter that these two should come
to dwell here for a while after that i hope we shall all return to
egypt togeth though maga be on a secret mission doe not travel
under hi own name but as a merchant
suddenli he paus and began to stare at my throat
is aught wrong with my armour father i ask
no son i wa look at that trinket which you wear of cours i have
note it befor but never close it is strang veri strang
what is strang father
onli that i have seen anoth like it

no no i mean in egypt and what is more a stori hung to the jewel
on whom where what stori i ask eagerli
oh i cannot stai to tell you now moreov your mind should be fix
upon immort crown and not on earthli necklac i must be gone nai
stai me not i am alreadi late do you get you to your knee and prai
till your godpar come to fetch you
then in spite of all i could do to keep him he went mutter
strang exceed strang and leav me quit unfit for prayer
an hour later i wa ride through the street of the mighti citi clad
in shine armour as the season wa that of octob in which the feast

them we convert whom the peopl applaud openli
look to right and left of me for i wa weari of keep my gaze
fix upon the floor present i caught sight of a face whilst as yet
it wa far awai it seem to draw me i knew not why the face wa that
of a woman she stood by an old and statelylook man with a white
beard the last of a line of worshipp next to the aisl along which
the process pass and i saw that she wa young and fair
down the long resound aisl the process march slowli now i wa
nearer to the face and perceiv that it wa love as some richhu
flower the larg ey were dark and soft as a deer the complexion
too wa somewhat dark as though the sun had kiss it the lip were
red and curv and about them plai a littl smile that wa full of
mysteri as the ey were full of thought and tender the figur wa
delic and round but not so veri tall all these thing and other
i note yet it wa not by them that i wa drawn and held but rather
becaus i knew thi ladi
she wa the woman of whom year ago i had dream on the night on
which i broke into the wander tomb at aar
never for on moment did i doubt me of thi truth i wa sure i wa
sure it did not even need while she turn to whisper someth to her
companion that the cloak she wore should open a littl reveal on
her breast a necklac of emerald beetl separ by inlaid shell of
pale and ancient gold
she wa watch the process with interest yet somewhat idli when
she caught sight of me whom from where she stood she could scarc
have seen befor of a sudden her face grew doubt and troubl like
to that of on who ha just receiv some hurt she saw the ornament
about my neck she turn pale and had she not grip the arm of the
man besid her would i think have fallen then her ey caught mine
and fate had us in it net
she lean forward gaze gaze all her soul in those dark ey
and i too gaze and gaze the great cathedr vanish with it
glitter crowd the sound of chant and of feet that march di
from my ear in place of these i saw a mighti column templ and two
stone figur taller than pine seat on a plain and through the
moonlit silenc heard a sweet voic murmur
farewel for thi life farewel
now we were near to each other now i wa pass her i who might not
stai my hand brush her and oh it wa as though i had drunk a cup
of wine a spirit enter into me and bend i whisper in her ear
speak in the latin tongu sinc greek which all knew i did not
dare to us av post secula greet after the ag
i saw her bosom heav ye and heard her whisper back
av
so she knew me also
chapter vi
heliodor
that night there wa feast at the palac and i olaf now known as
michael as a convert wa on of the chief guest so that for me there
wa no escap i sat veri silent so silent that the augusta frown
though she wa too far off to speak to me the banquet came to an end at
last and befor midnight i wa free to go still without word from the
empress who withdrew herself as i thought in an illhumour
i sought my bed but in it knew littl of sleep i had found her for
whom dure all the long year i had been search though i did not
understand that i wa search after the ag i had found her and she
had found me her ey said it and unless i dream her sweet voic
said it also
who wa she doubtless that heliodor daughter of maga the princ of
whom the bishop barnaba had spoken to me oh now i understood what
he meant when he spoke of anoth necklac like to that i wore and yet
would explain noth it lai upon the breast of heliodor heliodor
who wa such a on as he wish that i might wed well certainli i
wish it too but ala how could i wed who wa in iren power
a toi for her to plai with or to break and how would it fare with ani
woman whom it wa known that i wish to wed i must be secret until she
wa gone from constantinopl and in thi wai or in that i could
follow her i who had ever been openmind must learn to keep my own
counsel
now too i rememb how barnaba had said the augusta command that
thi princ maga and hi daughter should come to the palac as her
guest well the place wa vast a town in itself and like enough
i should not see them there yet i long to see on of them as never
i had long for anyth befor i wa sure also that no fear could
keep us apart even though i knew the road befor me to be full of
danger and of trial knew that i went with my life in my hand the
life of which i had been quit careless but that now had becom so dear
to me for did not the world hold anoth to whom it belong
the night pass awai i rose and went about my morn duti scarc
were these finish when a messeng summon me to the presenc of the

letter by the hand of martina here bid him open all hi heart to
you for a week or more i shall have no time to spend upon thi maga
who must give myself to busi upon which hang my power and perchanc
my life
these word she spoke heavili then fell into a fit of brood rous
herself she went on
did you note yesterdai olaf if you had ani mind left for the thing
of earth that as i drove in state through the street mani met me with
sullen silenc while other curs me openli and shout where is the
augustu give us constantin we will have no woman rule
i saw and heard someth of these thing augusta also that certain
of the soldier on guard in the citi had a mutin air
ay but what you did not see and hear wa that a plot had been laid
to murder me in the cathedr i got wind of it in time and if you
were still governor of yonder prison youd know where the murder ar
todai yet theyr but tool it is their captain whom i want well
tortur mai make them speak stauraciu ha gone to see to it oh the
strife is fierc and doubt i walk blindfold along a precipic abov
ar fortun height and beneath black ruin perhap youd be wise
to get you to constantin olaf and becom hi man as mani ar do
sinc hed be glad of you no need to shake your head for that not
your wai you ar no hound to bite the hand that feed you like these
streetbr dog would that i could keep you nearer to me where hour
by hour you might help me with your counsel and your quiet strength
but it mai not bea yet i rais you as high as i dare but it must be
done step by step for even now some grow jealou take heed to what you
eat olaf see that your guard ar northmen and beneath your doublet
wear mail especi at night moreov unless i send for you do not
come near me too often and when we meet be my humbl servant like
other ay learn to crawl and kiss the ground abov all keep secret
as the grave
now she went on after a paus dure which i stood silent what is
there more oh with your new offic youll retain that of captain
of my guard for i would be well watch dure these next few week
follow up the matter of the egyptian you mai find advanc in it
perchanc on dai you will be the gener i send against the moslemsif
i can spare you on all thi matter be secret also for onc rumour
buzz over it that peach rot the egyptian and hi swarthi girl come
to the palac todai when he will receiv my letter meet him and see
them well hous though not too near me martina will help you now be
gone and leav me to my battl
so i went and she watch me to the door with ey that were full of
tender
again there is a blank in my memori or my vision i suppos that
maga and hi daughter heliodor arriv at the palac on the dai of my
interview with iren of which i have told i suppos that i welcom
them and conduct them to the guest hous that had been made readi for
them in the garden doubtless i listen eagerli to the first word
which heliodor spoke to me save that on in the cathedr the word
of greet doubtless i ask her mani thing and she gave me mani
answer but of all thi noth remain
what come back to me is a pictur of the egyptian princ maga and
myself seat at some meal in a chamber overlook the moonlit palac
garden we were alon and thi nobl whitebeard man hooknos
and hawkei wa tell me of the troubl of hi countrymen the
christian copt of egypt
look on me sir he said as i could prove to you were it worth
while and as mani could bear wit for the record have been kept
i am a descend in the true line from the ancient pharaoh of my
countri moreov my daughter through her grecian mother is sprung
from the ptolemi our race is christian and ha been for these three
hundr year although it wa among the last to be convert yet
nobl as we ar we suffer everi wrong at the hand of the moslem our
good and land ar doubli tax and if we should go into the town of
lower egypt we must wear garment on which the cross is broider as
a badg of shame yet where i livenear to the first cataract of
the nile and not so veri far from the citi of old thebesth
prophetworshipp have no real power i am still the true ruler of
that district as the bishop barnaba will tell you and at ani moment
were my standard to be lift i could call three thousand coptic spear
to fight for christ and egypt moreov if monei were forthcom the
host of nubia could be rais and togeth we might sweep down on the
moslem like the nile in flood and drive them back to alexandria
then he went on to set out hi plan which in sum were that a roman
fleet and armi should appear at the mouth of the nile to besieg and
captur alexandria and with hi help massacr or drive out everi
moslem in egypt the scheme which he set forth with much detail seem
feasibl enough and when i had master it particular i promis to
report it to the empress and afterward to speak with him further
i left the chamber and present stood in the garden although it wa
autumn time the night in thi mild climat wa veri warm and pleasant
and the moonlight threw black shadow of the tree across the path
under on of these tree an ancient greenleav oak the largest of
a littl grove i saw a woman sit perchanc i knew who she wa
perchanc i had come thither to meet her i cannot sai at least thi
wa not our first meet by mani for as i came she rose lift her
flowerlik face toward my own and next moment wa in my arm
when we had kiss our full we began to talk seat hand in hand
beneath the oak
what have you been do thi dai belov she ask
much what i do everi dai heliodor i have attend to my duti
which ar threefold as chamberlain as master of the palac and as
captain of the guard also for a littl while i saw the augusta to
whom i had to report variou matter the interview wa brief sinc a
rumour had reach her that the armenian regiment refus to take the
oath of fidel to her alon as she ha command should be done and
demand that the name of the emperor her son should be coupl with
her as befor thi report disturb her much so that she had littl
time for other busi
did you speak of my father matter olaf
ay shortli she listen and ask whether i were sure that i had
got the truth from him she ad that i had best test it by what i
could win from you by ani art that a man mai us for heliodor
becaus of someth that my godmoth martina said to her it is
fix in her mind that you ar blackskin and veri ugli therefor
the augusta who doe not like ani man about her to care for other
women think i mai make love to you with safeti so i prai for leav
from my duti on the guard thi even that i might sup with your
father in the guesthous and see what i could learn from on or both
of you
love make you clever olaf but hearken i do not believ that the
empress think me black and ugli ani longer as it chanc while i
walk in the inner garden thi afternoon where you said i might go
when i wish to be quit alon dream of our love and you i look
up and saw an imperi woman of middl ag who wa gorgeou as
a peacock watch me from a littl distanc i went on my wai
pretend to see no on and heard the ladi sai
ha all thi troubl driven me mad martina or did i behold a woman
beauti as on of the nymph of my peopl fabl wander yonder
among those bush
i repeat her veri word olaf not becaus thei ar truefor
rememb she saw me at a distanc and against a background of rock and
autumn flowersbut becaus thei were her word which i think you ought
to hear with those that follow them
iren ha said mani fals thing in her life i said smile but by
all the saint these were not among them
then we embrac again and after that wa finish heliodor her head
rest on my shoulder continu her stori
what wa she like mistress ask the ladi martina for by thi
time i had pass behind some littl tree i have seen no on who is
beauti in thi garden except yourself
she wa clad in a cling white robe martina that left her arm
and bosom bareb alon olaf i wore my egyptian dress beneath my
cloak which i had laid down becaus of the heat of the sun she wa
not so veri tall yet round and most grace her ey seem larg
and dark martina like her hair her face wa tint like a richhu
rose oh were i a man she seem such a on as i should love who like
all my peopl have ever worship beauti yet what did i sai that
she put me in mind of a nymph of greec nai that wa not so it wa of
a goddess of old egypt that she put me in mind for on her face wa the
dream smile which i have seen on that of a statu of mother isi whom
the egyptian worship moreov she wore just such a headdress as i
have note upon those statu
now the ladi martina answer sure you must have dream
mistress the onli egyptian woman in the palac is the daughter of the
old coptic nobl maga who is in olaf charg and though i am told
that she is not so ugli as i heard at first olaf ha never said to me
that she wa like a goddess what you saw wa doubtless some imag of
fortun conjur up by your mind thi i take to be the best of omen
who in these doubt dai grow superstiti
would olaf tell on woman that anoth wa like a goddess martina
even though she to whom he spoke wa hi godmoth and a dozen year
younger than himself come she ad and let us see if we can find
thi egyptian
then heliodor went on not know what to do i stood still there
against the rockwork and the flower till present round the bush
appear the splendid ladi and martina
now when i olaf heard all thi i groan and said
oh heliodor it wa the augusta herself
ye it wa the augusta as i learn present well thei came and i
curtsi to them
ar you the daughter of maga the egyptian ask the ladi ey
me from head to foot
ye madam i answer i am heliodor the daughter of maga
i prai that i have done no wrong in walk in thi garden but the
gener olaf the master of the palac gave me leav to come here
and did the gener olaf whom we know as michael give you that
necklac which you wear also o daughter of maga nai you must need
answer me for i am the augusta
now i curtsi again and said
not so o augusta the necklac is from old egypt and wa found upon
the bodi of a royal ladi in a tomb i have worn it for mani year
inde and that which the gener michael wear came also from a
tomb
ye he told me so augusta i said
it would seem that the two must onc have been on daughter of
maga
it mai be so augusta i do not know
now the empress look about her and the ladi martina drop
behind began to fan herself
ar you marri girl she ask
no i answer
ar you affianc
now i hesit a littl then answer no again
you seem to be somewhat doubt on the point farewel for thi
while when you walk abroad in our garden which is open to you be
pleas to arrai yourself in the dress of our countri and not in that
of a courtesan of egypt
what did you answer to that sai i ask
that which wa not wise i fear olaf for my temper stir me
i answer madam i thank you for your permiss to walk in your
garden if ever i should do so again as your guest be sure that i will
not wear garment which befor byzantium wa a villag were sacr to
the god of my countri and those of my ancestor the queen of egypt
and then i ask
the empress answer well spoken such would have been my own word
had i been in your place moreov thei ar true and the robe becom
you well yet presum not too far girl see that byzantium is no
longer a villag and egypt ha some fanat moslem for a pharaoh who
think littl of your ancient blood
so i bow and went and as i walk awai heard the empress rate the
ladi martina about i know not what save that your name came into the
matter and my own why doe thi empress talk so much about you olaf
see that she ha mani offic who ar higher in her servic and why
wa she so move about thi matter of the necklac of golden shell
heliodor i answer i must tell now what i have hidden from you
the augusta ha been pleasedwhi i cannot sai but chiefli i suppos
becaus of late year it ha been my fanci to keep myself apart from
women which is rare in thi landto show me certain favour i gather
even that whether she mean it or mean it not she ha thought of me
as a husband
oh interrupt heliodor start awai from me now i understand
everyth and prai have you thought as a wife of her who ha been a
widow these ten year and ha a son of twenti
god abov us alon know what i have or have not thought but it is
certain that at present i think of her onli as on who ha been most
kind to me but who is more to be fear than my worst foe if i have
ani
hush she said rais her finger i fanci i heard someon stir
behind us
fear noth i answer we ar alon here for i set guard of my
own compani around the place with command to admit no on and my order
run against all save the empress in person
then we ar safe olaf sinc thi damp would disarrang her hair
which i note is curl with iron not by natur like my own oh
olaf olaf how wonder is the fate that ha brought us togeth i
sai that when i saw you yonder in the cathedr for the first time sinc
i wa born i knew you again as you knew me that is why when you
whisper to me greet after the ag i gave you back your
welcom i know noth of the past if we live and love befor that
tale is lost to me but there your dream and there the necklac
when i wa a child olaf it wa taken from the embalm bodi of some
royal woman who by tradit wa of my own race ye and by record
of which my father can tell you for he is among the last who can still
read the write of the old egyptian moreov she wa veri like me
olaf for i rememb her well as she lai in her coffin preserv by
art which the egyptian had she wa young not much older than i am
todai and her stori tell that she di in give birth to a son who
grew up a strong and vigor man and although he wa but half royal
found a new dynasti in egypt and becam my forefath thi necklac
lai upon her breast and beneath it a write on papyru which said
that when the half of it which wa lost should be join again to that
half then those who had worn them would meet onc more as mortal
now the two halv of the necklac have met and we have met as god
decre and it is on and we ar on for ever and for ever let everi
empress of the earth do what thei will to part us
ay i answer embrac her again we ar on for ever and for
ever though perchanc for a while we mai be separ from time to
time
chapter vii
victori or valhalla
a minut later i heard a rustl as of branch be move by peopl
thrust their wai through them a choke voic command
take him live or dead
arm men appear about us four of them and on cri yield
i sprang up and drew the wander sword
who order the gener michael to yield in hi own command i ask
i do answer the man yield or die
now think that these were robber or murder hire by some enemi
i sprang at him nor wa that battl long for at my first stroke he
fell dead then the other three set on me but i wore mail beneath my
doublet as iren had bade me do and their sword glanc moreov
the old northern rage enter into me and these eastern were no
match for my skill and strength first on and then anoth of them
went down whereon the third fled awai take with him a grizzli wound
behind for i struck him as he fled
now it seem there is an end of that i gasp to heliodor who wa
crouch upon the seat come let me take you to your father and summon
my guard er we meet more of these murder
as i spoke a cloak and hood woman glide from the shelter of the
tree behind and stood befor us she threw back the hood from her head
and the moonlight fell upon her face it wa that of the empress but
oh so chang by jealou rage that i should scarc have known her the
larg ey seem to flash fire the cheek were white save where thei
had been touch with paint the lip trembl twice she tri to speak
and fail but at the third effort word came
nai all is but begun she said in a voic that wa full of hate
know that i have heard your everi word so traitor you would tell my
secret to thi egyptian slut and then murder my own servant and she
point to the dead and wound men well you shall pai for it both
of you that i swear
is it murder augusta i ask salut when four assail on man
and think them assassin he fight for hi life and win the frai
what ar four such cur against you i should have brought a dozen yet
it wa at me you struck whateer thei did i order them to do
had i known it augusta i would never have drawn sword who am your
offic and obedi to the end
nai youd stab me with your tongu not with your sword she answer
with someth like a sob you sai you ar my obedi offic well
now we will see smite me that boldfac baggag dead or smite me
dead i care not which then fall upon your sword
the first i cannot do augusta for it would be murder against on who
ha done no wrong and i will not stain my soul with murder
done no wrong ha she not mock me my year my widowhood ye and
even my hair in the pride of herher youth me the empress of the
world
now heliodor spoke for the first time
and ha not the empress of the world call a poor maid of blood as
nobl as her own by shame name she ask
for the second i went on befor iren could answer i cannot do that
either for it would be foul treason as well as murder to lift my sword
against your anoint majesti but as for the third as is my duti that
i will door rather suffer your servant to doif it pleas you to
repeat the order later when you ar calm
what cri heliodor would you go and leav me here then olaf
by the god my forefath worship for ten thousand year and by
the god i worship ill find a mean to follow you within an hour oh
empress of the world there is anoth world you do not rule and there
well call you to account
now iren stare at heliodor and heliodor stare back at her and the
sight wa veri strang
at least you have spirit girl but think not that shall save you for
there no room for both of us on earth
if i go it mai prove wide enough augusta i broke in
nai you shall not go olaf at least not yet my order ar that
you do not fall upon your sword as for thi egyptian witch well
present my peopl will be here then we will see
now i drew heliodor to the trunk of the great tree which stood near by
and set myself in front of her
what ar you about to do ask the empress
i am about to fight your eastern cur until i fall for no northern man
will lift a sword against me even on your order augusta when i am
down thi ladi must plai her own part as god shall guid her
have no fear olaf heliodor said gentli i wear a dagger
scarc had she spoken when there wa a sound of mani feet the man
whom i had wound had run shout toward the palac rous the
soldier both those on watch and those in their quarter now these
began to arriv and to gather in the glade befor the clump of tree
for some guard who had heard the clash of arm guid them to the
place thei were of all race and sundri regiment greek byzantin
bulgar armenian socal roman and with them a number of briton
and northern men
see the empress and near by myself stand with drawn sword
against the tree shelter the ladi heliodor also on the ground those
whom i had cut down thei halt on of their offic ask what thei
must do
kill me that man who ha slain my servant or staytak him live
scream the augusta
now among those who had gather wa a certain lieuten of my own a
blueei flaxenhair norwegian giant of the name of jodd thi man
love me like a brother i believ becaus onc it had been my fortun
to save hi life also often i had prove hi friend when he wa in
troubl for in those dai jodd got drunk at time and when he wa
drunk lost monei which he could not pai
now when he saw my case i note that thi jodd who if sober wa no
fool at all although he seem so slow and stupid whisper someth
to a comrad who wa with him whereon the man turn and fled awai like
an arrow from the direct in which he went i guess at onc that he
wa run to the barrack close at hand where were station quit
three hundr northmen all of whom were under my command
the soldier prepar to obei the augusta order as thei were bound
to do thei drew their sword and a number of them advanc toward me
slowli then it wa that jodd with a few northmen move between them
and me and salut the empress said in hi bad greek

be kill until he ha been heard gener olaf and draw hi short
sword for the first time he salut me in form be pleas to explain

now a tumult aros and a eunuch in the background shout to the
soldier to obei the empresss order whereon again some of them began
to advanc
if no answer is given to my question went on jodd in hi slow
bulllik voic i fear that other must be kill besid the gener
olaf ho northmen to me northmen ho briton to me briton ho
saxon to me saxon ho all who ar not accurs greek to me all

now at each cry of jodd men leapt forward from the gather crowd
and to the number of fifti or more in all marshal themselv behind
him those of each nation stand shoulder to shoulder in littl group
befor me
is my question to be answer ask jodd becaus if not although
we be but on against ten i think that er the gener olaf is cut down

heliodor here is my affianc wife we were speak togeth in thi
garden as the affianc do the empress who unseen by us wa hidden
behind those tree overheard our talk which for reason best known
to herself for in it there wa naught of treason or ani matter of
the state made her so angri that she set her servant on to kill me
think them murder or robber i defend myself and there thei

order me to kill the ladi heliodor comrad look on her whom the
empress order me to kill and sai whether were she your affianc
you would kill her even to pleas the empress and step to on

now from those that jodd had summon there went up a roar of no
while even the rest were silent iren sprang forward and cri
ar my order to be canvass and debat obei cut thi man down or
take him live i care not which and with him all who cling to him or
tomorrow you hang everi on of you
now the soldier who had gather also began to form up under their
offic for thei saw that befor them wa war and death by thi time
thei were mani and as the alarm spread minut by minut more arriv
yield or we attack said he who had taken command of them
i do not think that we yield answer jodd and just then there came
a sound of men run in order compani from the direct of the
northmen barrack were jodd messeng had told hi tale

be silent olaf for thi hour you ar not our gener you ar a

now some of them drew behind us then thei began to advanc take us
along with them and i who wa skill in war saw their purpos thei
were draw out into the open glade where thei could see to fight and
where their flank would be protect by a stream of water on the on
hand and a dens belt of tree on the other
in her rage the empress threw herself upon the ground but two great
fellow lift her up by the arm and thrust her along with us march
thu we reach the point that thei had chosen for the greek were in
confus and not readi to attack there we halt just on the crest of
a littl rise of ground
augusta i said in the name of god i prai you to give wai these
northmen hate your byzantin and will take thi chanc to pai off
their score moreov thei love me and will die to a man er thei see
me harm and then how shall i protect you in the frai
she onli glare at me and made no answer
the attack began by thi time fifteen hundr or so of the imperi
troop had collect and against them stood perhap four hundr
men in all so that the odd were great still thei had no horsemen or
archer and our posit wa veri good also we were northmen and thei
were grecian scum
on came the byzantin scream iren iren in a format of
compani rang on behind the other for their object wa to break in
our centr by their weight jodd saw and gave some order veri good
order i thought them then he sheath hi shortsword seiz the
great battleax which wa hi favourit weapon and place himself in
front of our tripl line that wait in dead silenc
up the slope surg the charg and on the crest of it the battl met
at first the weight of the greek press us back but oh thei went
down befor the northmen steel like corn befor the sickl and soon
that rush wa stai breast to breast thei hew and thrust and so
fear wa the frai that iren forget her rage clung to me to
protect her
the fight hung doubt as in a dream i watch the giant jodd cut
down a gorgeou captain the ax shear through hi golden armour as
though it were but silk i watch a comrad of my own fall beneath a
spearthrust i gaze at the face of heliodor who stare wideei
at the red scene and at the whitelip iren who wa cling to my
arm now we were be press back again we who at thi point had at
most two hundr men some of whom were down to bear the onslaught
of twice that number and do what i would my finger strai to my
swordhilt
our tripl line bent in like a bow and began to break the scale of
war hung on the turn when from the dens belt of tree upon our left
suddenli rose the cry of valhalla valhalla victori or valhalla
for which i who had overheard jodd order wa wait these were
hi ordersthat half of the northmen should creep down behind the belt
of tree in their dens shadow and thu outflank the foe
forth thei sprang by compani of fifti the moonlight gleam on their
mail and there three hundr yard awai a new battl wa begun now
the greek in front of us fear for their rear waver a moment and
fell back perhap ten pace i saw the opportun and could bear no
more who befor all thing wa a soldier
shout to some of our wound to watch the women i drew my sword and
leapt forward
i come northmen i cri and wa greet with a roar of
olaf redsword follow olaf redsword for so the soldier name me
steadi northmen shoulder to shoulder northmen i cri back now
at them charg valhalla victori or valhalla
down the slope thei went befor our rush in thirti pace thei were but
a huddl mob on which our sword plai like lightn we roll
them back on to their support and those support outflank began
to flee we swept through and through them we slew them by hundr we
trod them beneath our victori feet andoh in that battl a strang
thing happen to me i thought i saw my dead brother ragnar fight
at my side ay and i thought i heard him cry to me in that lost
rememb voic
the old blood run in you yet you christian man oh you fight well

it wa done some were fled but more were dead for onc at grip the
northman show no merci to the greek back we came those who were left
of us for mani perhap a hundr were not and form a ring round
the women and the wound
well done olaf said heliodor but iren onli look at me with a
kind of wonder in her ey
now the leader of the northmen began to talk among themselv but
although from time to time thei glanc at me thei did not ask me to
join in their talk present jodd came forward and said in hi slow
voic
olaf redsword we love you who have alwai love us your comrad
as we have shown you tonight you have led us well olaf and
consid our small number we have just won a victori of which we
ar proud but our neck ar in the noos as your is and we think
that in thi case our best cours is to be bold therefor we name you
csar have defeat the greek we propos now to take the palac and
to talk with the regiment without mani of whom ar disloy and shout
for constantin whom after all thei hate onli a littl less than thei
do iren yonder we know not what will be the end of the matter and do
not greatli care who set our fortun upon a throw of the dice but
we think there is a good chanc of victori do you accept and will you
throw in your sword with our
how can i i answer when there stand the empress whose bread i
have eaten and to whom i have sworn fealti
an empress it seem who desir to slai you over some matter that
ha to do with a woman olaf the dagger of her assassin have cut thi
thread of fealti moreov as it chanc she is in our power and as we
cannot make our crime against her blacker than it is we propos to rid
you and ourselv of thi empress who is our enemi and who for her
great wicked well deserv to die such is our offer to take or to
leav as time is short should you refus it we abandon you to your
fate and go to make our term with constantin who also hate thi
empress and even now is plot her downfal
as he spoke i saw certain men draw near to iren for a purpos which i
could guess and step between her and them
the augusta is my mistress i said and although i attack some of
her troop but now and she ha wrong me much still i defend her to
the last
littl us in that olaf see that you ar but on and we ar mani
answer jodd come will you be csar or will you not
now iren crept up behind me and whisper in my ear

will save my life and my throne of which i vow to you an equal share
with the help of your northmen and the legion i command and who cling
to me we can defeat constantin and rule the world togeth thi
petti frai is noth what matter it if some live have been lost in
a palac tumult the world li in your grasp take it olaf and with
it me
i heard and understood now had come the great moment of my life
someth told me that on the on hand were majesti and empir on the
other much pain and sorrow yet with these a certain holi joi and peac
it wa the latter that i chose as doubtless fate or god had decre
that i should do
i thank you augusta i said but while i can protect her i will
not seiz a throne over the bodi of on who ha been kind to me nor
will i bui it at the price you offer there stand my predestin wife
and i can marri no other woman
now iren turn to heliodor and said in a swift low voic
do you understand thi matter ladi let us have done with jealousi
and be plain for the live of all of us hang upon thread that for
some must break within a dai or two and with them those of a thousand
thousand other ay the destini of the world is at stake you sai you
love thi man whom i will tell you i love also well if you win him
and he live which he scarc can hope to do he get your kiss in
whatev corner of the earth will shelter him and you if i win him
the empir of the earth is hi moreov girl she ad with mean
empress ar not alwai jealou sometim even thei can look the
other wai there would be high place for you within our court and who
know your turn might come at length also your father plan would be
forward to the last pound of gold in our treasuri and the last soldier
in our servic within five year mayhap he might rule egypt as our
governor what sai you
heliodor look at the empress with that strang slow smile of her
then she look at me and answer
i sai what olaf sai there ar two empir in the case on which

here is onli a woman heart yet as i think of anoth etern world

you ar mistaken olaf answer the empress in a cold and quiet
voic but seemingli without anger your fate li there and she
point to the ground then ad believ me i am sorri for you ar
a man of whom ani woman might be proudy even an empress i have
alwai thought it and i thought it again just now when i saw you lead

the wound in the middl keep that empress live for the present but
when all is done kill her well be her escort to the gate of hell
for there she bound if ever woman wa
then without murmur or complaint almost in silenc inde thei
form odin ring that tripl circl of the northmen doom to die
the terribl circl that on mani a battlefield ha been hidden at last
beneath the heap of fallen foe
the regiment move up there were three of them of full strength iren
stare about her seek some loophol of escap and find none
heliodor and i talk togeth in low tone make our tryst beyond
the grave the regiment halt within fifti pace of us thei like not
the look of odin ring and the ground over which thei had march
and the fugit with whom thei had spoken told them that mani of them
look their last upon the moon
some mount gener rode toward us and ask who wa in command of
the northmen when thei learn that it wa jodd thei invit him to a
parlei the end of it wa that jodd and two other step twenti pace
from our rank and met a councillorit wa stauraciusand two of
the gener in the open where no treacheri could well be practis
especi as stauraciu wa not a man of war here thei talk togeth

so that all might hear him
hearken these ar the term offer that we return to our barrack in

redsword must be surrend with the empress we answer that in thi

consid all and i think it best that i should be surrend with
the augusta to the greek
we will not surrend you thei shout
comrad i am still your gener and my order is that you surrend

barnaba and prai him to get her and her father awai to egypt without

greet me with a fals and sickli smile
chapter viii
the trial of olaf
i know not what time went by befor i wa put upon my trial but that
trial i can still see as clearli as though it were happen befor my
ey it took place in a long low room of the vast palac build
that wa light onli by windowplac set high up in the wall these
wall were fresco and at the end of the room abov the seat of the
judg wa a rude pictur in bright colour of the condemn of
christ by pilat pilat i rememb wa repres with a black face
to signifi hi wicked i suppos and in the air abov him hung a
redei imp shape like a bat who grip hi robe with on claw and
whisper into hi ear
there were seven judg he who presid be a lawoffic and the
other six captain of differ grade chosen mostli from among the
survivor of those troop whom the northmen had defeat on the night
of the battl in the palac garden as thi wa a militari trial i
wa allow no advoc to defend me nor inde did i ask for ani the
court howev wa open and crowd with spectat among whom i saw
most of the great offic of the palac stauraciu with them also
some ladi on of whom wa martina my godmoth the back of the
long room wa pack with soldier and other not all of whom were my
enemi
into thi place i wa brought guard by four negro great fellow
arm with sword whom i knew to be chosen out of the number of the
execution of the palac and the citi inde on of them had serv
under me when i wa governor of the state prison and been dismiss by
me becaus of some cruelti which he had practis
note all these thing and the piti in martina ey i knew that
i wa alreadi doom but as i had expect noth els thi did not
troubl me over much
i stood befor the judg and thei stare at me
why do you not salut us fellow ask on of them a minc greek
captain whom i had seen run like a hare upon the night of the frai
becaus captain i am of senior rank to ani whom i see befor me and
as yet uncondemn therefor if salut ar in the question it is you
who should salut me
at thi speech thei stare at me still harder than befor but among the
soldier at the end of the hall there aros someth like a murmur of
applaus
wast no time in listen to hi insol said the presid of the
court clerk set out the case
then a blackrob man who sat beneath the judg rose and read the
charg to me from a parchment it wa brief and to the effect that i
michael formerli known as olaf or olaf redsword a northman in the
servic of the empress iren a gener in her armi a chamberlain and
master of the palac had conspir against the empress had kill her
servant had detain her person threaten to murder her had made
war upon her troop and slain some hundr of them by the help of other
northmen and wound mani more
i wa ask what i plead to thi charg and repli
i am not guilti
then wit were call the first of these wa the fourth man whom
iren had set upon me who alon escap with a wound behind thi
fellow have been carri into court for he could not walk lean
over a bar for he could not sit down and told hi stori when he had
finish i wa allow to examin him
why did the empress order you and your companion to attack me i
ask
i think becaus she saw you kiss the egyptian ladi gener at which
answer mani laugh
you tri to kill me did you not
ye gener for the empress order us so to do
then what happen
you kill or cut down three of us on after the other gener be
too skil and strong for us as i turn to fly me you wound here
and drag himself round with difficulti he show how my sword had
fallen on a part where no soldier should receiv a wound at thi sight
those in the court laugh again
did i provok you in ani wai befor you attack me
no inde gener it wa the empress you provok by kiss the
beauti egyptian ladi at least i think so sinc everi time you
kiss each other she seem to becom more mad and at last order us
to kill both of you
now the laughter grew veri loud for even the court offic could no
longer restrain themselv and the ladi hid their face in their
hand and titter
awai with that fool shout the presid of the court and the poor
fellow wa hustl out what becam of him afterward i do not know
though i can guess
now appear wit after wit who told of the frai which i have
describ alreadi though for the most part thei tri to put anoth
colour on the matter of mani of these men i ask no question inde
grow weari of their tale i said at length to the judg
sir what need is there for all thi evid see that among you
i perceiv three gallant offic whom i saw run befor the northmen
that night when with some four hundr sword we rout about two
thousand of you you yourselv therefor ar the best wit of
what befel moreov i acknowledg that be move by the sight of
war in the end i led the charg against you befor which charg some
di and mani fled you among them
now these captain glower at me and the presid said
the prison is right what need is there of more evid
i think much sir i answer sinc but on side of the stori ha
been heard now i will call wit of whom the first should be the
augusta if she is will to appear and tell you what happen within
the circl of the northmen on that night
call the augusta gasp the presid perchanc prison michael

slowli of thi i am sure that in a time to come although it be not
tomorrow or the next dai you and everyon who ha to do with thi case
will find that i have not call him in vain
at these word for a few moment a solemn silenc fell upon the court
it wa as though thei had gone home to the heart of everyon who wa
present there also i saw the curtain that drape a galleri high up
in the wall shake a littl it came into my mind that iren herself wa
hidden behind those curtain as afterward i learn wa the case and
that she had made some movement which caus them to trembl
well said the presid after thi paus as god doe not appear to
be your wit and as you have no other see that you cannot give
evid yourself under the law we will now proce to judgment
who sai that the gener olaf olaf redsword ha no wit
exclaim a deep voic at the end of the hall i am here to be hi
wit
who speak ask the presid let him come forward
there wa a disturb at the end of the hall and through the crowd
that he seem to throw befor him to right and left appear the mighti
form of jodd he wa clad in full armour and bore hi famou battleax
in hi hand
on whom some of you know well enough as other of your compani who
will never know anyth again have done in the past on name jodd
the northman second in command of the guard to the gener olaf he
answer and march to the spot where wit were accustom to
stand

judg

of the imperi guard
after thi there wa no more talk of remov jodd ax and he
proceed to give hi evid which as it onli detail what ha been
written alreadi need not be repeat what effect it produc upon the
judg i cannot sai but that it move those present in the court wa
clear enough
have you done ask the presid at length when the stori wa
finish
not altogeth said jodd olaf redsword wa promis an open trial
and that he ha sinc otherwis i and some friend of mine could not be
in thi court to tell the truth where perhap the truth ha seldom been
heard befor also he wa promis a fair trial and that he ha not
see that the most of hi judg ar men with whom he fought the other
dai and who onli escap hi sword by flight tomorrow i propos to ask
the peopl of byzantium whether it is right that a man should be tri
by hi conquer enemi now i perceiv that you will find a verdict of
guilti against olaf redsword and perhap condemn him to death well
find what verdict you will and pass what sentenc you will but do not
dare to attempt to execut that sentenc
dare dare shout the presid who ar you man who would
dictat to a court appoint by the empress what it shall or shall
not do be care lest we pass sentenc on you as well as on your
fellowtraitor rememb where you stand and that if i lift my finger
you will be taken and bound
ay lawyer i rememb thi and other thing for instanc that i
have the safeconduct of the empress under an oath sworn on the cross of
the christ she worship for instanc also that i have three hundr
comrad wait my safe return
three hundr snarl the presid the empress ha three thousand
within these wall who will soon make an end of your three hundr
i have been told lawyer answer jodd that onc there live
anoth monarch on call xerx who thought that he would make an
end of a certain three hundr greek when greek were differ from
what you ar todai at a place call thermopyl he made an end of
them but thei cost him more than he care to pai and now it is those
greek who live for ever and xerx who is dead but that not all
sinc that frai the other night we northmen have found friend have you
heard of the armenian legion presid those who favour constantin
well kill olaf redsword or kill me jodd and you have to deal first
with the northmen and next with the armenian legion now here i am
wait to be taken by ani who can pass thi ax
at these word a great silenc fell upon the court jodd glare about
him and see that none ventur to draw near step from the
witnessplac advanc to where i wa gave me the full salut of
ceremoni then march awai to the back of the court the crowd open
a path for him
when he had gone the judg began to consult togeth and as i
expect veri soon agre upon their verdict the presid said or
rather gabbl
prison we find you guilti have you ani reason to offer why sentenc
of death should not be pass upon you
sir i answer i am not here to plead for my life which alreadi i
have risk a score of time in the servic of your peopl yet i would
sai thi on the night of the outbreak i wa set on four to on for no
crime as you have heard and did but protect myself afterward when i
wa about to be slain the northmen my comrad protect me unask
then i did my best to save the life of the empress and in fact
succeed my onli offenc is that when the great charg took place and
your regiment were defeat rememb onli that i wa a soldier i
led that charg if thi is a crime worthi of death i am readi to
die yet i hold that both god and man will give more honour to me the
crimin than to you the judg and to those who befor ever you sat
in thi court instruct you whom i know to be but tool as to the
verdict that you should give
the applaus which my word call forth from those gather at the end
of the court di awai in the midst of a great silenc the presid
who like hi companion i could see well wa grow somewhat
fear read the sentenc in a low voic from a parchment after
set out the order by which the court wa constitut and other
matter it ran
we condemn you michael otherwis call olaf or olaf redsword to
death thi sentenc will be execut with or without tortur at such
time and in such manner as it mai pleas the augusta to decre
now the voic of jodd wa heard cry through the gather gloom for
night wa near
what sort of judgment is thi that the judg bring alreadi written
down into the court hearken you lawyer and you streetcur hi
companion who call yourselv soldier if olaf redsword di those
hostag whom we hold die also if he is tortur those hostag will
be tortur also moreov er long we will sack thi fine place and
what ha befallen olaf shall befal you also you fals judg neither
less nor more rememb it all you who shall have charg of olaf in hi
bond and if she be within hear let the augusta iren rememb it
also lest anoth time there should be no olaf to save her life
now i could see that the judg were terrifi hastili with white
face thei consult togeth as to whether thei should order jodd to
be seiz present i heard the presid sai to hi companion
nai best let him go if he is touch our hostag will die
moreov doubtless constantin and the armenian ar at the back of
him or he would not dare to speak thu would that we were clear of
thi busi which ha been thrust upon us
then he call aloud let the prison be remov
down the long court i wa march onli now guard who had been call
in went in front of and behind me and with them the four execution
by whom i wa surround
farewel godmoth i whisper to martina as i pass
nai not farewel she whisper back look up at me with ey that
were full of tear though what she meant i did not know
at the end of the court where those who dare to sympathis with me
openli were gather rough voic call bless on me and rough
hand pat me on the shoulder to on of these men whose voic i
recognis in the gloom i turn to speak a word thereon the black
execution who wa between us he whom i had dismiss from the jail
for cruelti struck me on the mouth with the back of hi hand next
instant i heard a sound that remind me of the growl the white bear
gave when it grip steinar two arm shot out and caught that black
savag by the head there wa a nois as of someth break and down
went the mana corps
then thei hurri me awai for now it wa not onli the judg who were
afraid
it come to me that for some dai three or four i sat in my cell at
the palac for here i wa kept becaus as i learn afterward it wa
fear that if i were remov to that state prison of which i had been
governor some attempt would be made to rescu me
thi cell wa on of sever situat beneath that broad terrac which
look out on to the sea where iren had first question me as to the
shell necklac and against my prayer had set it upon her own breast
it had a littl bar window out of which i could watch the sea and
through thi window came the sound of sentri tramp overhead and of
the voic of the offic who at state hour arriv to turn out the
guard as for some year it had been my duti to do
i wonder who that offic might be and wonder also how mani of
such men sinc byzantium becam the capit of the empir had fill
hi offic and mine and what had becom of them all as i knew if
that terrac had been abl to speak it could have told mani bloodi
histori whereof doubtless mine would be anoth doubtless too
there were more to follow until the end came whatev that might be
in that strait place i reflect on mani thing all my youth came back
to me i marvel what had happen at aar sinc i left it such long
year ago onc or twice rumour had reach me from men in my compani
who were danishborn that iduna wa a great ladi there and still
unmarri but of freydisa i had heard noth probabl she wa dead
and if so i felt sure that her fierc and faith spirit must be near
me now as that of ragnar had seem to be in the battl of the garden
how strang it wa that after all my vision had been fulfil and it
had been my lot to meet her of whom i had dream wear that necklac
of which i had found onehalf upon the wander in hi gravemound were
i and the wander the same spirit i ask of myself and she of the
dream and heliodor the same woman
who could tell at least thi wa sure from the moment that first we
saw on anoth we knew we belong each to each for the present and
the futur therefor as it wa with these we had to do the past might
sleep and all it secret
now we had met but to be part again by death which seem hard
inde yet sinc we had met for my part fate had my forgiv for
i knew that we should meet again i look back on what i had done and
left undon and could not blame myself overmuch true it would have
been wiser if i had stai by iren and heliodor and not led that
charg against the greek onli then as a soldier i should never have
forgiven myself for how could i stand still while my comrad fought
for me no no i wa glad i had led the charg and led it well though
my life must pai it price nor wa thi so i must die not becaus
i had lift sword against iren troop but for the sin of love
heliodor
after all what wa life as we knew it a pass breath well as the
bodi breath mani million time between the cradl and the grave so i
believ the soul must breath out it countless live each end in a
form of death and beyond these what i did not know yet my newfound
faith gave me much comfort
in such medit and in sleep i pass my hour wait alwai until
the door of my cell should open and through it appear not the jailer
with my food which i note wa plenti and delic but the
execution or mayhap the tormentor
at length it did open somewhat late at night just as i wa about to
lai myself down to rest and through it came a veil woman i bow and
motion to my visitor to be seat on the stool that wa in the cell
then wait in silenc present she threw off her veil and in the
light of the lamp show that i stood befor the empress iren
olaf she said hoars i am come here to save you from yourself if
it mai be so i wa hidden in yonder court and heard all that pass at
your trial
i guess as much augusta i said but what of it
for on thing thi the coward and fool who now is deadof hi
woundswho gave evid as to the kill of the three other coward
by you ha caus my name to becom a mock throughout constantinopl
ay the vilest make song upon me in the street such song as i
cannot repeat
i am griev augusta i said
it is i who should griev not you who ar told of as a man who grew
weari of the love of an empress and cast her off as though she were
a tavern wench that is the first matter the second is that under the
find of the court of justic
oh augusta i interrupt why stain your lip with those word of
justic
under the find of the court she went on your fate is left
in my hand i mai kill you or torment your bodi or i mai spare you and
rais your head higher than ani other in the empir ay and adorn it
with a crown
doubtless you mai do ani of these thing augusta but which of them do
you wish to do
olaf notwithstand all that ha gone i would still do the last i
speak to you no more of love or tender nor do i pretend that thi
is for your sake alon it is for mine also my name is smirch and
onli marriag can cover up the stain upon it moreov i am beset by
troubl and by danger those accurs northmen who love you so well
and who fight not like men but like devil ar in leagu with the
armenian legion and with constantin my gener and my troop fall
awai from me if it were assail i am not sure that i could hold thi
palac strong though it be there but on man who can make me safe
again and that man is yourself the northmen will do your bid and
with you in command of them i fear no attack you have the honesti the
wit and the soldier skill and courag you must command or none onli
thi time it must not be as iren lover for that is what thei name
you but as her husband a priest is wait within call and on of
high degre within an hour olaf you mai be my consort and within a
year the emperor of the world oh she went on with passion cannot
you forgiv what seem to be my sin when you rememb that thei were
wrought for love of you
augusta i said i have small ambit i am not mind to be an
emperor but hearken put asid thi thought of marriag with on so far
beneath you and let me marri her whom i have chosen and who ha chosen
me then onc more ill take command of the northmen and defend you and
your caus to the last drop of my blood
her face harden
it mai not be she said not onli for those reason i have told you
but for anoth which i griev to have to tell heliodor daughter of
maga the egyptian is dead
dead i gasp dead
ay olaf dead you did not see and she be a brave woman hid it
from you but on of those spear that were flung in the fight struck
her in the side for a while the wound went well but two dai ago it
mortifi last night she di and thi morn i myself saw her buri
with honour
how did you see her buri you who ar not welcom among the
northmen i ask
by my order as her blood wa high she wa laid in the palac
graveyard olaf
did she leav me no word or token augusta she swore to me that if she
di she would send to me the other half of that necklac which i wear
i have heard of none said iren but you will know olaf that i
have other busi to attend to just now than such deathb gossip
these thing do not come to my ear
i look at iren and iren look at me
augusta i said i do not believ your stori no spear wound
heliodor while i wa near her and when i wa not near her your greek
were too far awai for ani spear to be thrown inde unless you
stab her secretli she wa not wound and i am sure that howev
much you have hate her thi you would not have dare to do for your
own life sake augusta for your own purpos you ar try to
deceiv me i will not marri you do your worst you have li to me
about the woman whom i love and though i forgiv you all the rest thi
i do not forgiv you know well that heliodor still live beneath the
sun
if so answer the empress you have look your last upon the sun
andher never again shall you behold the beauti of heliodor have you
aught to sai there is still time
noth augusta at present except thi of late i have learn to
believ in a god i summon you to meet me befor that god there we will
argu out our case and abid hi judgment if there is no god there will
be no judgment and i salut you empress who triumph if as i believ
and as you sai you believ there is a god think whom you will be
call upon to salut when that god ha heard the truth meanwhil i
repeat that heliodor the egyptian still live beneath the sun
iren rose from the stool on which she sat and thought a moment i gaze
through the bar of the windowplac in my cell out at the night abov
a young moon wa float in the sky and near to it hung a star a
littl pass cloud with a dent edg drift over the star and the
lower horn of the moon it went by and thei shone out again upon
the background of the blue heaven also an owl flit across the
windowplac of my cell it had a mous in it beak and the shadow of
it and of the writh mous for a moment lai upon iren breast for
i turn my head and saw them it came into my mind that here wa an
allegori iren wa the nighthawk and i wa the writh mous that
fed it appetit doubtless it wa decre that the owl must be and the
mous must be but beyond them both hidden in those blue heaven stood
that justic which we call god
these were the last thing that i saw in thi life of mine and
therefor i rememb them well or rather almost the last the veri
last of which i took note wa iren face it had grown like to that of
a devil the great ey in it stare out between the puf and purpl
eyelid the paint cheek had sunk in and were pallid beneath and
round the paint the teeth show in two white line the chin work
she wa no longer a beauti woman she wa a fiend
iren knock thrice upon the door bolt were thrown back and men
enter
blind him she said
chapter ix
the hall of the pit
the dai and the night went by but which wa dai and which wa night
i knew not save for the visit of the jailer with my mealsi who wa
blind i who should never see the light again at first i suffer much
but by degre the pain di awai also a physician came to tend my
hurt a skil man soon i discov howev that he had anoth
object he piti my state so much inde he said that he offer to
suppli me with a drug that if i were will to take it would make
an end of me painlessli now i understood at onc that iren desir my
death and fear to caus it set the mean of selfmurd within my
reach
i thank the man and beg him to give me the drug which he did
whereon i hid it awai in my garment when it wa seen that i still
live although i had ask for the medicin i think that iren believ
thi wa becaus it had fail to work or that such a mean of death
did not pleas me so she found anoth on even when a jailer
brought my supper he press someth heavi into my hand which i felt
to be a sword
what weapon is thi i ask and why do you give it to me
it is your own sword answer the man which i wa command to
return to you i know no more
then he went awai leav the sword with me
i drew the familiar blade from it sheath the red blade that the
wander had worn and touch it keen edg with my finger wept from
my blind ey to think that never again could i hold it aloft in war
or see the light flash from it as i smote ye i wept in my weak
till i rememb that i had no longer ani wish to be the death of men
so i sheath the good sword and hid it beneath my mattress lest some
jailer should steal it which as i could not see him he might do
easili also i desir to put awai temptat
i think that thi hour after the bring of the sword which stir up
so mani memori wa the most fear of all my hour so fear that
had it been prolong death would have come to me of it own accord
i had sunk to miseri lowest deep who did not know that even then it
tide wa turn who could not dream of all the bless year that lai
befor me the year of love and of such peac joi as even the blind
mai win
that night martina camemartina who wa hope harbing i heard
the door of my prison open and close softli and sat still wonder
whether the murder had enter at last wonder too whether i
should snatch the sword and strike blindli till i fell next i heard
anoth sound that of a woman weep ye and felt my hand lift
and press to a woman lip which kiss it again and yet again
a thought struck me and i began to draw it back a soft voic spoke
between it sob
have no fear olaf i am martina oh now i understand why yonder
tigress sent me on that distant mission
how did you come here martina i ask
i still have the signet olaf which iren who begin to mistrust
me forget onli thi morn i learn the truth on my return to the
palac yet i have not been idl within an hour jodd and the northmen
knew it also within three thei had blind everi hostag whom thei
held ay and caught two of the brute who did the deed on you and
crucifi them upon their barrack wall
oh martina i broke in i did not desir that other who ar
innoc should share my woe
nor did i olaf but these northmen ar ill to plai with moreov
in a sens it wa need you do not know what i have learnedthat
tomorrow iren propos to slit your tongu also becaus you can tell
too much and afterward to cut off your right hand lest you who ar
learn should write down what you know i told the northmennev
mind how thei sent a herald a greek whom thei had captur and
cover him with arrow made him call out that if your tongu wa slit
thei would know of it and slit the tongu of all the hostag also and
that if your hand wa cut off thei could cut off their hand and take
anoth vengeanc which for the present thei keep secret
at least thei ar faith i said but oh tell me martina what
of heliodor
thi she whisper into my ear heliodor and her father sail an
hour after sunset and ar now safe upon the sea bound for egypt
then i wa right when iren told me she wa dead she li
ay if she said that she li though thrice she ha striven to murder
her i have no time to tell you how but wa alwai baffl by those who
watch yet she might have succeed at last so although heliodor
fought against it it wa best that she should go those who ar part
mai meet again but how can we meet on who is dead until we too ar
dead
how did she go
smuggl from the citi disguis as a boi attend on a priest and
that priest her father shorn of hi beard and tonsur the bishop
barnaba pass them out in hi follow
then bless on the bishop barnaba i said
ay bless on him sinc without hi help it could never have been
done the secret agent at the port stare hard at those two although
the good bishop vouch for them and gave their name and offic
still when thei saw some roughlook fellow dress like sailor
approach plai with the handl of their knive the agent thought
well to ask no more question moreov now that the ship ha sail
for their own sake theyll swear that no such priest and boi went
aboard of her so your heliodor is awai unharm as is her father
though hi mission ha come to naught still hi life is left in him
for which he mai be thank who on such a busi should have brought
no woman if he had come alon olaf your ey would have been left to
you and set by now upon the orb of empir that your hand had grasp
yet i am glad that he did not come alon martina
truli you have a high and faith heart and that woman should be
honour whom you love what is the secret there must be more in it
than the mere desir for a woman beauti though i know that at time
thi can make men mad in such a busi the soul must plai it part
i think so martina inde i believ so sinc otherwis we suffer
much in vain now tell me how and when do i die
i hope you will not die at all olaf certain plan ar laid which
even here i dare not whisper tomorrow i hear thei will lead you again
befor the judg who by iren clemenc will chang your sentenc
to on of banish with secret order to kill you on the voyag but
you will never make that voyag other scheme ar afoot youll learn
of them afterward
yet martina if you know these plot the augusta know them also
sinc you and she ar on
when those dagger point were thrust into your ey olaf thei cut the
thread that bound us and now iren and i ar more far apart than
hell and heaven i tell you that for your sake i hate her and work her
downfal am i not your godmoth olaf
then again she kiss my hand and present wa gone
on the follow morn as i suppos it to be my jailer came and
said to me that i must appear befor the judg to hear some revis of
my sentenc thei dress me in my soldier gear and even allow me
to gird my sword about me know doubtless that save to himself a
blind man could do no mischief with a sword then thei led me i know
not whither by passag which turn now here now there at length we
enter some place for door were close behind us
thi is the hall of judgment said on of them but the judg
have not yet come it is a great room and bare there is noth in it
against which you can hurt yourself therefor if it pleas you after
be cramp so long in that narrow cell you mai walk to and fro
keep your hand in front of you so that you will know when you touch
the further wall and must turn
i thank them and glad enough to avail myself of thi grace for
my limb were stiff with want of exercis began to walk joyfulli i
thought that the room must be on of those numberless apart which
open on to the terrac sinc distinctli i could hear the wash of the
sea come from far beneath doubtless through the open windowplac
forward i step boldli but at a certain point in my march thi
curiou thing happen a hand seem to seiz my own and draw me to the
left wonder i follow the guidanc of the hand which present
left hold of mine thereon i continu my march and as i did so
thought that i heard anoth sound like to that of a suppress murmur
of human voic twenti step more and i reach the end of the chamber
for my outstretch finger touch it marbl wall i turn and
march back and lo at the twentieth step that hand took mine again
and led me to the right whereon onc more the murmur of voic reach
me
thrice thi happen and everi time the murmur grew more loud inde
i thought i heard on sai
the man not blind at all and anoth some spirit guid him
as i made my fourth journei i caught the sound of a distant tumult
the shout of war the scream of agoni and abov them all the
wellrememb cry of valhalla valhalla victori or valhalla
i halt where i wa and felt the blood rush into my wast cheek the
northmen my northmen were in the palac it wa at thi that martina
had hint yet in so vast a place what chanc wa there that thei would
ever find me and how be blind could i find them well at least my
voic wa left to me and i would lift it
so with all my strength i cri aloud olaf redsword is here to olaf
men of the north
thrice i cri i heard folk run not to me but from me doubtless
those whose whisper had reach my ear
i thought of try to follow them but the soft and gentl hand which
wa like to that of a woman onc more clasp mine and held me where i
wa suffer me to move no singl inch so there i stood even
after the hand had loos me again for it seem to me that there wa
someth most strang in thi busi
present anoth sound aros the sound of the northmen pour toward
the hall for feet clang louder and louder down the marbl corridor
more thei had met those who were run from the hall for now these
fled back befor them thei were in the hall for a cry of horror
mingl with rage broke from their lip
ti olaf said on olaf blind and by thor see where he
stand
then jodd voic roar out
move not olaf move not or you die
anoth voic that of martina broke in silenc you fool or youll
frighten him and make him fall silenc all and leav him to me
then quiet fell upon the place it seem that even the pursu grew
quiet and i heard the rustl of a woman dress draw toward me
next instant a soft hand took my own just such a hand as not long ago
had seem to guid and hold me and martina voic said
follow where i lead olaf
so i follow eight or ten pace then martina threw her arm about me
and burst into wild laughter someon caught her awai next moment
two hairclad lip kiss me on the brow and the mighti voic of jodd
shout
thank be to all the god dwell thei in the north or in the south we
have save you know you where you stood olaf on the brink of a pit
the veri brink and beneath is a fall of a hundr feet to where the
water of the bosphoru wash among the rock oh understand thi pretti
grecian game thei good christian folk would not have your blood upon
their soul and therefor thei caus you to walk to your own death

could sit to watch a blind man walk to hi doom to make their sport
ah whom have we here why by thor ti the lawyer knave he who wa
presid of the court that tri you and wa angri becaus you did not
salut him well lawyer the wheel ha gone round we northmen ar in
possess of the palac and the armenian legion ar gather at it
gate and do but wait for constantin the emperor to enter and take the
empir and it crown theyll be here anon lawyer but you understand
have a certain life to save for word had been brought to us of your
pretti do that we were forc to strike befor the signal and
struck not in vain now well fill in the tediou time with a trial
of our own see here i am presid of the court seat in thi fine
chair and these six to right and left ar my companion judg while
you seven who were judg ar now prison you know the crime with
which you ar charg so there no need to set it out your defenc
lawyer and be swift with it
oh sir said the man in a trembl voic what we did to the
gener olaf we were order to do by on who mai not be name
youd best find the name lawyer for were it that of a god we northmen
would hear it
well then by the augusta herself she wish the death of the nobl
michael or olaf but have becom superstiti about the matter
would not have hi blood directli on her hand therefor she bethought
her of thi plan he wa order to be brought into the place you see
which is known as the hall of the pit that in old dai wa us by
certain bloodymind emperor to rid them of their enemi the central
pavement swing upon a hing at a touch it open and he who ha
thought it sound and walk thereon when dark come is lost sinc
he fall upon the rock far below and at high tide the water take
him
ye ye we understand the game lawyer for there yawn the open pit
but have you aught more to sai
noth sir noth save that we onli did what we were driven to do
moreov no harm ha come of it sinc whenev the nobl gener came
to the edg of the open pit although he wa blind he halt and went
off to right or left as though someon drew him out of danger
well then cruel and unjust judg who could gather to mock at the
murder of a blind man that you had trap to hi doom
sir broke in on of them it wa not we who tri to trap him it
wa those jailer who stand there thei told the gener that he might
exercis himself by walk up and down the hall
is that true olaf ask jodd
ye i answer it is true that the two jailer who brought me here
did tell me thi though whether those men ar present i cannot sai
veri good said jodd add them to the other prison who by their
own show heard them set the snare and did not warn the victim now
murder all thi is the sentenc of the court upon you that you
salut the gener olaf and confess your wicked to him
so thei salut me kneel and kiss my feet and on and all made
confess of their crime
enough i said i pardon them who ar but tool prai to god that he
mai do as much

hereaft but we the northmen do not pardon blindfold those men and
bind their arm now went on jodd after a paus their turn ha come
to show us sport run friend run for sword ar behind you can you
not feel them
the rest mai be guess within a few minut the seven judg and the
two jailer had vanish from the world no hand came to save them
from the cruel rock and the water that seeth a hundr feet below
that dread chamber
thi fantast savag vengeanc wa a thing dread to hear what it
must have been to see i can onli guess i know that i wish i might
have fled from it and that i plead with jodd for merci on these men
but neither he nor hi companion would listen to me
what merci had thei on you he cri let them drink from their own
cup
let them drink from their own cup roar hi companion and then
broke into a roar of laughter as on of the fals judg feel space
befor him leapt leapt short and with a shriek depart for ever
it wa over i heard someon enter the hall and whisper in jodd ear
heard hi answer also
let her be brought hither he said for the rest bid the captain
hold stauraciu and the other fast if there is ani sign of stir
against us cut their throat advis them that thi will be done
should thei allow troubl to aris do not fire the palac unless i give
the word for it would be a piti to burn so fine a build it is those
who dwell in it who should be burn but doubtless constantin will see
to that collect the richest of the booti that which is most portabl
and let it be carri to our quarter in the baggag cart see that
these thing ar done quickli befor the armenian get their hand into
the bag ill be with you soon but if the emperor constantin should
arriv first tell him that all ha gone well better than he hope
inde and prai him to come hither where we mai take counsel
the messeng went jodd and some of the northmen began to consult
togeth and martina led me asid
tell me what ha chanc martina i ask for i am bewild
a revolut that is all olaf jodd and the northmen ar the point of
the spear it handl is constantin and the hand that hold it ar the
armenian it ha been veri well done some of the guard who remain
were bribe other frighten awai onli a few fought and of them

thrice round the edg of the pit and did hold me almost until you and
the northmen rush in
oh god is great she gasp god is veri great and to him i give
thank but hearken to the end of the tale i awok from my swoon and
heard nois without and abov it the northmen cry of victori thei

knew not which wai to turn till suddenli we heard your voic and ran
toward it
that is all the stori olaf
chapter x
olaf give judgment
as martina finish speak i heard the sound of tramp guard and of
a woman dress upon the pavement then a voic that of iren
spoke and though her word were quiet i caught in them the trembl of
smother rage
be pleas to tell me captain jodd she said what is happen in
my palac and why i the empress am hale from my apart hither by
soldier under your command
ladi answer jodd you ar mistaken yesterdai you were an empress
todai you arewel whatev your son the emperor choos to name
you as to what ha been and is happen in thi palac i scarc
know where to begin the tale first of all your gener and chamberlain
olafin case you should not recognis him i mean that blind man who
stand yonderwa be trick to death by certain servant of your
who call themselv judg and who state that thei were act by
your order
confront me with them said iren that i mai prove to you that thei
lie
certainli ho you bring the ladi iren here now hold her over that
hole nai struggl not ladi lest you should slip from their hand
look down steadili and you will see by the light that flow in from the
cave beneath certain heap ly on the rock round which the rise
water seeth there ar your judg whom you sai you wish to meet if
you desir to ask them ani question we can satisfi your will nai
why should you turn pale at the mere sight of the place that you thought
good enough to be the bed of a faith soldier of your own on high in
your servic whom it ha pleas you to blind why did it pleas you to
blind him ladi
who ar you that dare to ask me question she repli gather up
her courag
ill tell you ladi now that the gener olaf yonder is blind i am
the offic in command of the northmen who until you tri to murder
the said gener olaf a while ago were your faith guard i am also
as it chanc the offic in command of thi palac which we took thi
morn by assault and by arrang with most of your greek soldier
have learn from your confidenti ladi martina of the vile deed
you were about to work on the gener olaf
so it wa you who betrai me martina gasp iren and i had you
in my power oh i had you in my power
i did not betrai you augusta i save my godson yonder from tortur
and butcheri as by my oath i wa bound to do answer martina
have done with thi talk of betray went on jodd for who can
betrai a devil now ladi with your state quarrel we have noth to
do you can settl them present with your son that is if you still
live but with thi matter of olaf we have much to do and we will
settl that at onc the first part of the busi we all know so let
us get to the next by whose order were you blind gener olaf
by that of the augusta i answer
for what reason gener olaf
for on that i will not state i answer
good you were blind by the augusta for a reason you will not state
but which is well known to all of us now we have a law in the north
which sai that an ey should be given for an ey and a life for a life
would it not then be right comrad that thi woman should be blind
also
what scream iren blind i blind i the empress
tell me ladi ar the ey of on who wa an empress differ from
other ey why should you complain of that dark into which you were
so readi to plung on better than yourself still olaf shall judg
is it your will gener that we blind thi woman who put out your ey
and afterward tri to murder you
now i felt that all in that place were watch me and hang on the
word that i should speak so intent that thei never heard other
enter it as i did for a while i paus for why should not iren
suffer a littl of that agoni of suspens which she had inflict upon
me and other
then i said see what i have lost friend through no grave fault of
my own i wa in the wai of great i wa a soldier whom you trust
and like well on of unstain honour and of unstain name also i
love a woman by whom i wa belov and whom i hope to make my wife
and now what am i my trade is gone for how can a maim man lead in
war or even do the meanest servic of the camp the rest of my dai
should ani be grant to me must be spent in dark blacker than that
of midnight i must live on chariti when the littl store i have is
spent for i have taken no bribe and heap up no rich how can i
earn a live the woman whom i love ha been carri awai after thi
empress tri thrice to murder her whether i shall ever find her again
in thi world i know not for she ha gone to a far countri that is full
of enemi to christian men nor do i know whether she would be will
to take on who is blind and beggar for a husband though i think thi
mai be so
shame on her if she doe not mutter martina as i paus
well friend that is my case i went on let the augusta deni it if
she can
speak ladi do you deni it said jodd
i do not deni that thi man wa blind by my order in payment of
crime for which he might well have suffer death answer iren
but i do deni that i command him to be trap in yonder pit if
those dead men said so then thei li
and if the ladi martina sai so what then ask jodd
then she li also answer the empress sullenli
be it so repli jodd yet it is strang that act on thi lie
of the ladi martina we found the gener olaf upon the veri edg of
yonder hole ye with not the breadth of a barleycorn between him and
death now gener both parti have been heard and you shall pass
sentenc if you sai that yonder woman is to be blind thi moment
she look her last upon the light if you sai that she is to die thi
moment she bid farewel to life
again i thought a while it came into my mind that iren who had fallen
from power might rise onc more and bring fresh evil upon heliodor
now she wa in my hand but if i open that hand and let her free
someon move toward me and i heard iren voic whisper in my
ear
olaf she said if i sin against you it wa becaus i love you
would you be aveng upon on who ha burn her soul with so much
evil becaus she love too well oh if so you ar no longer olaf for
christ sake have piti on me sinc i am not fit to meet him give me
time to repent nai hear me out let not those men drag me awai as thei
threaten to do i am fallen now but who know i mai grow great again
inde i think i shall then olaf mai my soul shrivel everlastingli
in hell if i try to harm you or the egyptian morejesu be my wit
that i ask no lesser doom upon my head keep the men back martina for
what i swear to him and the egyptian i swear to you as well moreov
olaf i have great wealth you spoke of poverti it shall be far from
you martina know where my gold is hid and she still hold my kei
let her take it i sai leav me alon but on word more if ever it is
in my power ill forget everyth and advanc you all to great honour
your brain is not blind olaf you can still rule i swear i swear
i swear upon the holi blood ah now drag me awai if you will i have
spoken
then perchanc ladi you will allow olaf to speak sinc we who have
much to do must finish thi busi quickli befor the emperor come
with the armenian said jodd
captain jodd and hi comrad i said the empress iren ha been
pleas to make certain solemn vow to me which perchanc some of you
mai have overheard at least god heard them and whether she keep
them or no is a matter between her and the god in whom we both believ
therefor i set these vow asid thei draw me neither on wai nor the
other now you have made me judg in my own matter and have promis
to abid by my judgment which you will do hear it then and let it be
rememb for long i have been the augusta offic and of late her
gener and chamberlain as such i have bound myself by great oath to
protect her from harm in all case and those oath heretofor i have
kept when i might have broken them and not been blame by men whatev
ha chanc it seem that she is still empress and i am still her
offic see that my sword ha been return to me although it is
true she sent it that i might us it on myself it pleas the empress
to put out my ey under our soldier law the monarch who rule the
empir ha a right to put out the ey of an offic who ha lift
sword against her forc or even to kill him whether thi is done
justli or unjustli again is a matter between that monarch and god abov
to whom answer must be made at last therefor it would seem that i
have no right to pronounc ani sentenc against the augusta iren and
whatev mai have been my privat wrong i pronounc none yet as i
am still your gener until anoth is name i order you to free the
augusta iren and to work no vengeanc on her person for aught that mai
have befallen me at her hand were her deed just or unjust
when i had finish speak in the silenc that follow i heard iren
utter someth that wa half a sob and half a gasp of wonder then
abov the murmur of the northmen to whom thi rede wa strang rose
the great voic of jodd
gener olaf he said while you were talk it came into my mind
that on of those knife point which pierc your ey had prick the
brain behind them but when you had finish talk it came into my
mind that you ar a great man who put asid your privat right and
wrong and the glori of reveng which lai to your hand have taught
us soldier a lesson in duti which i at least never shall forget
gener if as i trust we ar togeth in the futur as in the past i
shall ask you to instruct me in thi christian faith of your which can
make a man not onli forgiv but hide hi forgiv under the mask of
duti for that as we know well is what you have done gener your
order shall be obei be she empress or noth thi ladi person is
safe from us more we will protect her to the best of our power as you
did in the battl of the garden yet i tell her to her face that had
it not been for those order had you for exampl said that you left
judgment to us she who ha spoilt such a man should have di a death
of shame
i heard a sound as of a woman throw herself upon her knee befor me
i heard iren voic whisper through her tear
olaf olaf for the second time in my life you make me feel asham
oh if onli you could have love me then i should have grown good like
you
there wa a stir of feet and anoth voic spoke a voic that should
have been clear and youth but sound as though it were thick with
wine it did not need martina whisper to tell me that it wa that of
constantin
greet friend he said and at onc there came a rattl of
salut sword and an answer cry of
greet augustu
you struck befor the time went on the thick boyish voic yet
as thing seem to have gone rather well for us i cannot blame
you especi as i see that you hold fast her who ha usurp my
birthright
now i heard iren turn with a swift and furiou movement
your birthright boi she cri what birthright have you save that
which my bodi gave
i thought that my father had more to do with thi matter of imperi
right than the grecian girl whom it pleas him to marri for her fair
face answer constantin insol ad learn your station
mother learn that you ar but the lamp which onc held the holi oil
and that lamp can be shatter
ay she answer and oil can be spilt for the dog to lap if their
gorg doe not rise at such rancid stuff the holi oil forsooth nai
the sour dreg of wine jar the outscour of the stew the filth
of the stabl of such is the holi oil that burn in constantin the
drunkard and the liar
it would seem that befor thi torrent of coars invect constantin
quail who at heart alwai fear hi mother and i think never more
so than when he appear to triumph over her or perhap he scorn to
answer it at least address jodd he said
captain i and my offic stand yonder unseen have heard
someth of what pass in thi place by what warrant do you and your
compani take upon yourselv to pass judgment upon thi mother of mine
that is the emperor right
by the warrant of captur augustu answer jodd we northmen took
the palac and open the gate to you and your armenian also we took
her who rule in the palac with whom we had a privat score to settl
that ha to do with our gener who stand yonder blind well it is
settl in hi own fashion and now we do not yield up thi woman our
prison save on your royal promis that no harm shall come to her in
bodi as for the rest it is your busi make a cookmaid of her
if you will onli then i think her tongu would clear the kitchen but
swear to keep her sound in life and limb till hell call her sinc
otherwis we must add her to our compani which will make no man
merrier
no answer constantin in a week she would corrupt you everi on
and breed a war well he ad with a boister laugh im master
now at last and ill swear by ani saint that you mai name or all of
them no harm shall come to thi empress whose rule is done and who
be without friend need not be fear still lest she should
spawn more mischief or murder she must be kept close till we and our
councillor decid where she shall dwell in futur ho guard take my
royal father widow to the dowerpalac and there watch her well if
she escap you shall die beneath the rod awai with the snake befor
it begin to hiss again
ill hiss no more said iren as the soldier form up round her
yet perchanc constantin you mai live to find that the snake still
ha strength to strike and poison in it fang you and other do you
come with me martina
nai ladi sinc here stand on whom god and you togeth have given
me to guard for hi sake i would keep my life in me and she touch
me on the shoulder
that whelp who is call my son spoke truli when he said that the
fallen have no friend exclaim iren well you should thank me
martina who made olaf blind sinc be without ey he cannot see
how ugli is your face in hi dark he mai perchanc mistak you
for the beauteou egyptian heliodor as i know you who love him madli
would have him do
with thi vile taunt she went
i think im craze said the emperor as the door swung to behind
her i should have struck that snake while the stick is in my hand i
tell you i fear her fang why if she could shed make me as that
poor man is blind or even butcher me well she my mother and iv
sworn so there an end now you olaf you ar that same captain
ar you not who dash the poison fig from my lip that thi tender
mother of mine would have let me eat when i wa in liquor ye and
would have swallow it yourself to save me from my folli
i am that man augustu
ay you ar that man and on of whom all the citi ha been talk
thei sai so poor is your tast that you turn your back upon the
favour of an empress becaus of some young girl you dare to love thei
sai also that she paid you back with a dagger in the ey she who wa
readi to set you in my place
rumour ha mani tongu augustu i answer at least i fell from
the empresss favour and she reward me as she held that i deserv
so it seem christ what a dread pit is that is thi anoth of
her gift nai answer not i heard the tale well olaf you save my
life and your northmen have set me on the throne sinc without them we
could scarc have won the palac now what payment would you have
leav to go henc augustu i answer
a small boon that you might have taken without ask if you can find
a dog to lead you like other blind wretch and you captain jodd and
your men what do you ask
such donat as it mai pleas the augustu to bestow and after that
permiss to follow wherev our gener olaf goe sinc he is our
care here we have made so mani enemi that we cannot sleep at night
the empress of the world fall from her throne muse constantin
and not even a waitingmaid attend her to her prison but a blind
captain find a regiment to escort him henc in love and honour as
though he were a newcrown king truli fortun is a jester if ever
fate should rob me of my ey i wonder when i had noth more to give
them if three hundr faith sword would follow me to ruin and to

book iii
egypt
chapter i
tide from egypt
that curtain of oblivion without rent or seam sink again upon the
vision of thi past of mine it fall as it were on the last of the
scene in the dread chamber of the pit to rise onc more far from
byzantium
i am blind and can see noth for the power which enabl me to
disint what li buri beneath the weight and wreck of so mani ag
tell me no more than those thing that onc my sens knew what i did
not hear then i do not hear now what i did not see then i do not see
now thu it come about that of lesbo itself of the shape of it
mountain or the colour of it sea i can tell noth more than i
wa told becaus my sight never dwelt on them in ani life that i can
rememb
it wa even the heat of the sun had pass and the night breez blew
through the wide cool chamber in which i sat with martina whom the
soldier in their rude fashion call olaf brown dog for brown
wa her colour and she led me from place to place as dog ar
train to lead blind men yet against her the roughest of them never
said an evil word not from fear but becaus thei knew that none could
be said
martina wa talk she who alwai love to talk if not of on thing
then of anoth
godson she said although you ar a great grumbler i tell you that
in my judgment you were born under a lucki star or saint call it which
you will for instanc when you were walk up and down that hall of
the pit in the palac at constantinopl which i alwai dream of now if
i sup too late
and your spirit or doubl or whatev you call it wa kindli lead
me round the edg of the deathtrap i interrupt
and my spirit or doubl make itself us for onc wa do
what you sai well who would have thought that befor so veri long you
would be the governor much belov of the rich and prosper island
of lesbo still the command much belov of troop mani of them
your own countrymen and although you ar blind the imperi gener
who ha dealt the moslem on of the worst defeat thei have suffer
for a long while
jodd and the other did that i answer i onli sat here and made
the plan
jodd she exclaim with contempt jodd ha no more head for plan
than a doorpost although it is true she ad with a soften of the
voic that he is a good man to lean on at a pinch and a veri terribl
fighter also on who can keep such brain as god gave him cool in the
hour of terror as iren know well enough yet it wa you olaf not
even i but you who rememb that the northmen ar seafolk born and
turn all those trade vessel into wargallei and hid them in the
littl bai with a few of your peopl in command of each it wa you who
suffer the moslem fleet to sail unmolest into the mitylen harbour
pretend and give notic that the onli defenc would be by land
then after thei were at anchor and begin to disembark it wa you
who fell on them at the dawn and sank and slew till none remain save
those of their armi who were taken prison or spare for ransom ye
and you command our ship in person and at night who is a better
captain than a blind man oh you did well veri well and you ar rich
with iren land and sit here in comfort and in honour with the best
of health save for your blind and i repeat that you were born under
a lucki staror saint
not altogeth so martina i answer with a sigh
ah she repli man can never be content as usual you ar think
of that egyptian i mean of the ladi heliodor of whom of cours
it is quit right that you should think well it is true that we have
heard noth of her still that doe not mean that we mai not hear
perhap jodd ha learn someth from those prison hark he
come
as she spoke i heard the guard salut without and jodd heavi step at
the door of the chamber
greet gener he said present i bring you good new the
messeng to the sultan harun have return with the ransom also thi
caliph send a write sign by himself and hi minist in which he
swear by god and hi prophet that in consider of our give up our
prison among whom it seem ar some great men neither he nor hi
successor will attempt ani new attack upon lesbo for thirti year
the interpret will read it to you tomorrow and you can send your
answer letter with the prison
see that these heathen ar so mani and we ar so few we could
scarc look for better term i said as i hope thei will think at
constantinopl at least the prison shall sail when all is in order
now for anoth matter have you inquir as to the bishop barnaba and
the egyptian princ maga and hi daughter
ay gener thi veri dai i found that among the prison were
three of the common sort who have serv in egypt and left that land
not three month ago of these men two have never heard of the bishop or
the other the third howev who wa wound in the fight had some
tide
what tide jodd
none that ar good gener the bishop he sai wa kill by moslem
a while ago or so he had been told
god rest him but the other jodd what of the other
thi it seem that the copt as he call him maga return from a
long journei as we know he did and rais an insurrect somewher in
the south of egypt far up the nile an expedit wa sent against him
under on musa the governor of egypt and there wa much fight
in which thi prison took part the end of it wa that the copt
who fought with maga were conquer with slaughter maga himself wa
slain for he would not fly and hi daughter the ladi heliodor wa
taken prison with some other coptic women
and then i gasp
then gener she wa brought befor the emir musa who note her
beauti propos to make her hi slave at her prayer howev be
as the prison said a merci man he gave her a week to mourn her
father befor she enter hi harem still the worst he went on
hurriedli did not happen befor that week wa done as the moslem
forc wa march down the nile she stab the eunuch who wa in
charg of her and escap
i thank god i said but jodd how is the man sure that she wa
heliodor
thu all knew her to be the daughter of maga on whom the egyptian
held in honour moreov among the moslem soldier she wa name the
ladi of the shell becaus of a certain necklac she wore which you
will rememb
what more i ask
onli that the emir musa wa veri angri at her loss and becaus of it
caus certain soldier to be beaten on the feet moreov he halt
hi armi and offer a reward for her for two dai thei hunt even
search some tomb where it wa thought she might have hidden but
there found noth but the dead then the emir return down the nile
and that is the end of the stori
send thi prison to me at onc jodd with an interpret i would
question him myself
i fear he is not fit to come gener
then i will go to him lead me martina
if so you must go far gener for he di an hour ago and hi
companion ar make him readi for burial
jodd i said angrili those men have been in our hand for week
how come it that you did not discov these thing befor you had my
order
becaus gener until thei knew that thei were to go free none
of these prison would tell us anyth howev close thei were
question thei said that it wa against their oath and that first
thei would die a long while ago i ask thi veri man of egypt and he
vow that he had never been there
be comfort olaf broke in martina for what more could he have
told you
noth perchanc i answer yet i should have gain mani dai of
time know that i go to egypt to search for heliodor
be comfort again said martina thi you could not have done until
the peac wa sign it would have been against your oath and duti
that is so i answer heavili
olaf said martina to me that night after jodd had left us you sai
that you will go to egypt how will you go will the blind christian
gener of the empir who ha just dealt so great a defeat to the
mighti caliph of the east be welcom in egypt abov all will he be
welcom by the emir musa who rule there when it is known that he
come to seek a woman who ha escap from that emir harem why
within an hour hed offer you the choic between death and the koran
olaf thi thing is mad
it mai be martina still i go to seek heliodor
if heliodor still live you will not help her by dy and if she is
dead time will be littl to her and she can wait for you a while
yet i go martina
you be blind go to egypt to seek on whom those who rule there
have search for in vain so be it but how will you go it cannot be
as an open enemi sinc then you would need a fleet and ten thousand
sword to back you which you have not to take a few brave men unless
thei were moslem which is imposs would be but to give them to
death how do you go olaf
i do not know martina your brain is more nimbl than mine think
think and tell me
i heard martina rise and walk up and down the room for a long time at
length she return and sat herself by me again
olaf she said you alwai had a tast for music you have told me
that as a boi in your northern home you us to plai upon the harp and
sing song to it of your own make and now sinc you have been blind
you have practis at thi art till you ar it master also my voic
is good inde it is my onli gift it wa my voic that first brought
me to iren notic when i wa but the daughter of a poor greek
gentleman who had been her father friend and therefor wa given a
small place about the court of late we have sung mani song togeth
have we not certain of them in that northern tongu of which you have
taught me someth
ye martina but what of it
you ar dull olaf i have heard that these eastern love music
especi if it be of a sort thei do not know why therefor should
not a blind man and hi daughterno hi orphan nieceearn an honest
live as travel musician in egypt these prophet worshipp i
am told think it a great sin to harm on who is maimeda poor northern
trader in amber who ha been rob by christian thiev render
sightless also that he might not be abl to swear to them befor the
judg and now with hi sister child win hi bread as best he
mai like you olaf i have skill in languag and even know enough of
arab to beg in it for my mother who wa a syrian taught it to me as
a child and sinc we have been here i have practis what sai you
i sai that we might travel as safe thu as in ani other wai yet
martina how can i ask you to tie such a burden on your back
oh no need to ask olaf sinc fate bound it there when it made me
yourgodmoth where you go i need must go also until you ar
marri she ad with a laugh afterward perhap you will need me
no more well there a plan for what it is worth and now well sleep
on it hope to find a better prai to st michael tonight olaf
as it chanc st michael gave me no light so the end of it wa that i
determin to plai thi part of a blind harper in those dai there
wa a trade between lesbo and egypt in cedar wood wool wine for the
copt for the moslem drank none and other good peac have been
declar between the island and the caliph a small vessel wa laden
with such merchandis at my cost and a greek of lesbo mena by name
put in command of it as the owner with a crew of sailor whom i could
trust to the death
to these men who were christian i told my busi swear them
to secreci by the most holi of all oath but ala as i shall
show although i could trust these sailor when thei were master of
themselv i could not trust them or rather on of them when
wine wa hi master in our northern land we had a sai that al
is anoth man and now it truth wa to be prove to me not for the
first time
when all wa readi i made known my plan to jodd alon in whose hand
i left a write to sai what must be done if i return no more to the
other offic and the soldier i said onli that i propos to make
a journei in thi trade ship disguis as a merchant both for my
health sake and to discov for myself the state of the surround
countri and especi of the christian in egypt
when he had heard all jodd although he wa a hopefulmind man grew
sad over thi journei which i could see he thought would be my last
i expect no less he said and yet gener i trust that your
saint might keep your feet on some safer path doubtless thi ladi
heliodor is dead or fled or wed at least you will never find her
still i must search for her jodd
you ar a blind man how can you search
then an idea came to him and he ad
listen gener i and the rest of us swore to protect the ladi
heliodor and to be as her father or her brother do you bide here i
will go to search for her either with a vessel full of arm men or
alon disguis
now i laugh outright and ask
what disguis is there that would hide the giant jodd whose fame the
moslem spi have spread throughout the east why on the darkest night
your voic would betrai you to all within a hundr pace and what us
would on shipload of arm men be against the forc of the emir of
egypt no no jodd whatev the danger i must go and i alon if i
am kill or do not return within eight month i have name you to
be governor of lesbo as alreadi you have been name my deputi by
constantin which appoint will probabl be confirm
i do not want to be governor of lesbo said jodd moreov olaf
he ad slowli a blind beggar must have hi dog to lead him hi
brown dog you cannot go alon olaf those danger of which you speak
must be share by anoth
that is so and it troubl me much inde it is in my mind to seek
some other guid for i think thi on would be safest here in your
charg you must reason with her jodd on can ask too much even of a
godmoth
of a godmoth why not sai of a grandmoth by thor olaf you ar
blind inde still ill try hush here she come to sai that our
supper is readi
at our meal sever other were present besid the serv folk and
the talk wa gener after it wa done i had an interview with some
offic these left and i sat myself down upon a cushion couch and
be tire there fell asleep till i wa awaken or rather half
awaken by voic talk in the garden without thei were those of
jodd and martina and martina wa sai
ceas your word i and no on els will go on thi egyptian quest with
olaf if we die as i dare sai we shall what doe it matter at least
he shall not die alon
and if the quest should fail martina i mean if he should not find the
ladi heliodor and you should happen both to return safe what then
why thennoth except that as it ha been so it will be i shall
continu to plai my part as is my duti and my wish do you not rememb
that i am olaf godmoth
ye i rememb still i have heard somewher that the christian
church never ti a knot which it cannot unloosefor a proper fee and
for my part i do not know why a man should not marri on of differ
blood becaus she ha been name hi godmoth befor a stone vessel
by a man in a broider robe you sai i do not understand such matter
perhap so let them be but martina let us suppos that thi strang
search were to succe and olaf ha a wai of succeed where other
would fail for instanc who els could have escap aliv out of the
hand of iren and becom governor of lesbo and be blind yet have
plan a great victori well suppos that by the help of god or
menor womenh should find thi beauti heliodor unw and still
will and that thei should marri what then martina
then captain jodd she answer slowli if you ar yet of the same
mind we mai talk again onli rememb that i ask no promis and make
none
so you go to egypt with olaf
ay certainli unless i should die first and perhap even then you
do not understand oh of cours you do not understand nor can i stop
to explain to you captain jodd i am go to egypt with a certain
blind beggar whose name i forget at the moment but who is my uncl
where no doubt i shall see mani strang thing if ever i come back i
will tell you about them and meanwhil good night
chapter ii
the statu by the nile
the first thing that i rememb of thi journei to egypt is that i wa
sit in the warm morn sunshin on the deck of our littl trade
vessel that went by the name of the heathen goddess diana we were
in the port of alexandria martina who now went by the name of hilda
stood by my side describ to me the great citi that lai befor us
she told me of the famou pharo still rise from it rock although in
it the warn light no longer burn for sinc the moslem took egypt
thei had let it die as some said becaus thei fear lest it should
guid a christian fleet to attack them she describ also the splendid
palac that the greek had built mani of them now empti or burn
out the christian church the mosqu the broad street and the
grassgrown quai
as we were thu engag she talk and i listen and ask
question she said
the boat is come with the saracen offic of the port who must
inspect and pass the ship befor she is allow to discharg her cargo
now olaf rememb that henceforth you ar call hodur i had taken
thi name after that of the blind god of the northern peopl plai
your part well and abov all be humbl if you ar revil or even
struck show no anger and be sure to keep that red sword of your close
hidden beneath your robe if you do these thing we shall be safe for i
tell you that we ar well disguis
the boat came alongsid and i heard men climb the ship ladder then
someon kick me it wa our captain mena who also had hi part to
plai
out of the road you blind beggar he said the nobl offic of the
caliph board our ship and you block their path
touch not on whom god ha afflict said a grave voic speak
in bad greek it is easi for us to walk round the man but who is he
captain and why doe he come to egypt by their look he and the woman
with him might well have seen happier dai
i know not lord answer the captain who after thei paid their
passag monei took no more note of them still thei plai and sing well
and serv to keep the sailor in good humour when we were becalm
sir i broke in i am a northman name hodur and thi woman is my
niec i wa a trader in amber but thiev rob me and my companion
of all we had as we journei to byzantium me who wa the leader of
our band thei held to ransom blind me lest i should be abl to
swear to them again but the other thei kill thi is the onli child
of my sister who marri a greek and now we get our live by our
skill in music
truli you christian love each other well said the offic accept
the koran and you will not be treat thu but why do you come to
egypt
sir we heard that it is a rich land where the peopl love music and
have come hope to earn some monei here that we mai put by to live on
send us not awai sir we have a littl offer to make niec hilda
where is the gold piec i gave you offer it to thi lord
nai nai said the offic shall i take bread out of the mouth of
the poor clerk he ad in arab to a man who wa with him make
out a write give leav to these two to land and to ply their
busi anywher in egypt without question or hindranc and bring it
to me to seal farewel musician i fear you will find monei scarc in
egypt for the land ha been stricken with a famin yet go and prosper
in the name of god and mai he turn your heart to the true faith
thu it came about that through the good mind of thi moslem whose
name as i learn when we met again wa yusuf our feet were lift
over mani stumblingblock thu it seem that by virtu of hi offic
he had power to prevent the entri into the land of such folk as we
seem to be which power if thei were christian wa almost alwai
put in forc yet becaus he had seen the captain appear to illtreat me
or becaus be a soldier himself he guess that i wa of the same
trade whatev tale it might pleas me to tell thi rule wa not
enforc moreov the write which he gave me enabl me to go where
we wish in egypt without let or hindranc whenev we were stop
or threaten which happen to us sever time it wa enough if we
present it to the nearest person in author who could read after
which we were allow to pass upon our wai unhind
befor we left the ship i had a last convers with the captain
mena tell him that he wa to lie in the harbour alwai pretend
that he wait for some cargo not yet forthcom such as unharvest
corn or whatev wa conveni until we appear again if after a
certain while we did not appear then he wa to make a trade journei
to neighbour port and return to alexandria these artific he must
continu to practis until order to the contrari reach him under my
own hand or until he had sure evid that we were dead all thi the
man promis that he would do
ye said martina who wa with me you promis captain and we
believ you but the question is can you answer for the other for
instanc for the sailor cosma there who i see is alreadi drunken
and talk loudli about mani thing
henceforth ladi cosma shall drink water onli when not in hi cup
he is an honest fellow and i do answer for him
yet ala as the end show cosma wa not to be answer for by
anyon
we went ashor and took up our abod in a certain hous where we were
safe whether the christian owner of that hous did or did not know who
we were i am not certain at ani rate through them we were introduc
at night into the palac of politian the melchit patriarch of
alexandria he wa a sternfac blackbeard man of honest heart but
narrow view of whom the bishop barnaba had often spoken to me as hi
closest friend to thi politian i told all under the seal of our faith
ask hi aid in my quest when i had finish my tale he thought a
while then he said
you ar a bold man gener olaf so bold that i think god must be
lead you to hi own end now you have heard aright barnaba my
belov brother and your father in christ ha been taken henc he wa
murder by some fanat moslem soon after hi return from byzantium
also it is true that the princ maga wa kill in war by the emir
musa and that the ladi heliodor escap out of hi clutch what
becam of her afterward no man know but for my part i believ that
she is dead
and i believ that she is aliv i answer and therefor i go to
seek her
seek and ye shall find muse the patriarch at least i hope so
though my advic to you is to bide here and send other to seek
that i will not do i answer again
then go and god be with you ill warn certain of the faith of your
come so that you mai not lack a friend at need when you return if
you should ever return come to me for i have more influenc with these
moslem than most and mai be abl to serv you i can sai no more
and it is not safe that you should tarri here too long stai i forget
there ar two thing you should know the first is that the emir musa
he who seiz the ladi heliodor is about to be depos i have the
new from the caliph harun himself for with him i am on friendli term
becaus of a servic i did him through my skill in medicin the second
is that iren ha beguil constantin or bewitch him i know not
which at least by hi own proclam onc more she rule the empir
jointli with himself and that i think will be hi death warrant and
perhap your also
suffici unto the dai is the evil thereof i said now if i live i
shall learn whether ani oath ar sacr to iren as will constantin
then we part
leav alexandria we wander first to the town of misra which stood
near to the mighti pyramid beneath whose shadow we slept on night in
an empti tomb thenc by slow march we made our wai up the bank of
the nile earn our daili bread by the exercis of our art onc
or twice we were stop as spi but alwai releas again when i
produc the write that the offic yusuf had given me upon the ship
for the rest none molest us in a land where wander beggar were
so common of monei it is true we earn littl but as we had gold
in plenti sewn into our garment thi did not matter food wa all we
need and that as i have said wa never lack
so we went on our strang journei dai by dai learn more of the
tongu spoken in egypt and especi of arab which the moslem
us whither did we journei we know not for certain what i sought to
find were those two huge statu of which i had dream at aar on the
night of the rob of the wander tomb we heard that there were
such figur of stone which were said to sing at daybreak and that
thei sat upon a plain on the western bank of the nile near to the ruin
of the great citi of thebe now but a villag call by the arab
eluksor or the palac so far as we could discov it wa in the
neighbourhood of thi citi that heliodor had escap from musa and
there if anywher i hope to gain tide of her fate also someth
within my heart drew me to those imag of forgotten god or men
at length two month or more after we left alexandria from the deck of
the boat in which we had hire a passag for the last hundr mile of
our journei martina saw to the east the ruin of thebe to the west
she saw other ruin and seat in front of them two mighti figur of
stone
thi is the place she said and my heart leapt at her word now let
us land and follow our fortun
so when the boat wa ti up at sunset to the west bank of the river
as it happen we bade farewel to the owner and went ashor
whither now ask martina
to the figur of stone i answer
so she led me through field in which the corn wa grow to the edg
of the desert meet no man all the wai then for a mile or more we
tramp through sand till at length late at night martina halt
we stand beneath the statu she said and thei ar awesom to look
on mighti seat king higher than a tall tree
what li behind them i ask
the ruin of a great templ
lead me to that templ
so we pass through a gatewai into a court and there we halt
now tell me what you see i said
we stand in what ha been a hall of mani column she answer but
the most of them ar broken at our feet is a pool in which there is
a littl water befor us li the plain on which the statu sit
stretch some mile to the nile that is fring with palm across
the broad nile ar the ruin of old thebe behind us ar more ruin and
a line of rug hill of stone and in them a littl to the north
the mouth of a vallei the scene is veri beauti beneath the moon but
veri sad and desol
it is the place that i saw in my dream mani year ago at aar i said
it mai be she answer but if so it must have chang sinc save
for a jackal creep among the column and a dog that bark in some
distant villag i neither see nor hear a live thing what now olaf
now we will eat and sleep i said perhap light will come to us in
our sleep
so we at of the food we had brought with us and afterward lai down to
rest in a littl chamber paint round with god that martina found in
the ruin of the templ
dure that night no dream came to me nor did anyth happen to
disturb us even in thi old templ of which the veri pavingston
were worn through by the feet of the dead
befor the dawn martina led me back to the coloss statu and we
wait there hope that we should hear them sing as tradit said
thei did when the sun rose yet the sun came up as it had done from the
begin of the world and struck upon those giant effigi as it had
done for some two thousand year or so i wa told and thei remain
quit silent i do not think that ever i griev more over my blind
than on thi dai when i must depend upon martina to tell me of the
glori of that sunris over the egyptian desert and those mighti ruin
rear by the hand of forgotten men
well the sun rose and sinc the statu would not speak i took my
harp and plai upon it and martina sang a wild eastern song to my
plai it seem that our music wa heard at ani rate a few folk
go out to labour came to see by whom it wa caus and find onli
two wander musician present went awai again still on remain
a woman coptic by her dress with whom i heard martina talk she
ask who we were and why we had come to such a place whereon martina
repeat to her the stori which we had told a hundr time the woman
answer that we should earn littl monei in those part as the famin
had been sore there ow to the low nile of the previou season until
the crop were ripe again which in the case of most of them would not
be for some week even food she ad must be scarc though few were
left to eat it sinc the moslem had kill out most of those who dwelt
in that district of upper egypt
martina repli that she knew thi wa so and therefor we had propos
either to travel on to nubia or to return north still as i her blind
uncl wa not well we had land from a boat hope that we might find
some place where we could rest for a week or two until i grew stronger
yet she continu meaningli be poor christian folk we know not
where to look for such a place sinc cross worshipp ar not welcom
among those who follow the prophet
now when the woman heard that we were christian her voic chang i
also am a christian she said but give me the sign
so we made the sign of the cross on our breast which a moslem will die
rather than do
my husband and i went on the woman live yonder at the villag of
kurna which is situat near to the mouth of the vallei that is call
bibanelmeluk or gate of the king for there the monarch of old
dai who were the forefath or ruler of us copt lie buri it is
but a veri small villag for the moslem have kill most of us in a
war that wa rais a while ago between them and our hereditari princ
maga yet my husband and i have a good hous there and be poor
shall be glad to give you food and shelter if you can pai us someth
the end of it wa that after some chaffer for we dare not show that
we had much monei a bargain wa struck between us and thi good woman
who wa name palka have paid her a week charg in advanc she
led us to the villag of kurna which wa nearli an hour walk awai
and here made us known to her husband a middleag man name marcu
who took littl note of anyth save hi farm
thi he carri on upon a patch of fertil ground that wa irrig by
a spring which flow from the mountain also he had other land near
to the nile where he grew corn and fodder for hi beast in hi hous
that onc had been part of some great stone build of the ancient
and still remain far larger than he could us for thi pair had no
children we were given two good room here we dwelt in comfort sinc
notwithstand the scarciti of the time marcu wa richer than he
seem and live well as for the villag of kurna it peopl all told
did not amount to more than thirti soul christian everi on of them
who were visit from time to time by a coptic priest from some distant
monasteri in the mountain
by degre we grew friendli with palka a pleasant bustl woman of
good birth who love to hear of the outsid world moreov she wa
veri shrewd and soon began to suspect that we were more than mere
wander player
pretend to be weak and ill i did not go out much but follow her
about the hous while she wa work talk to her on mani matter
thu i led up the subject of princ maga and hi rebellion and learn
that he had been kill at a place about fifti mile south from kurna
then i ask if it were true that hi daughter had been kill with him
what do you know of the ladi heliodor she ask sharpli
onli that my niec who for a while wa a servant in the palac at
byzantium befor she wa driven awai with other after the empress fell
saw her there inde it wa her busi to wait upon her and her
father the princ therefor she is interest in her fate
it seem that you ar more interest than your niec who ha never
spoken a word to me concern her answer palka well sinc you
ar a man i should not have thought thi strang had you not been
blind for thei sai she wa the most beauti woman in egypt as for
her fate you must ask god sinc none know it when the armi of musa
wa encamp yonder by the nile my husband marcu who had taken
two donkeyload of forag for sale to the camp and wa return by
moonlight saw her run past him a red knife in her hand her face set
toward the gatewai of the king after that he saw her no more nor did
anyon els although thei hunt long enough even in the tomb which
the moslem like our peopl fear to visit doubtless she fell or threw
herself into some hole in the rock or perhap the wild beast at her
better so than that a child of the old pharaoh should becom the woman
of an infidel
ye i answer better so but why do folk fear to visit those tomb
of which you speak palka
why becaus thei ar haunt that is all and even the bravest dread
the sight of a ghost how could thei be otherwis than haunt see
that yonder vallei is sown with the mighti dead like a field with corn
yet the dead sleep quietli enough palka
ay the common dead hodur but not these king and queen and
princ who be god of a kind cannot die it is said that thei
hold their revel yonder at night with song and wild laughter and that
those who look upon them come to an evil end within a year whether thi
be so i cannot sai sinc for mani year none have dare to visit that
place at night yet that thei eat i know well enough
how do you know palka
for a good reason with the other in thi villag i suppli the
offer of their food the stori run that onc the great build of
which thi hous is a part wa a colleg of heathen priest whose
duti it wa to make offer to the dead in the royal tomb when the
christian came those priest were driven awai but we of kurna who
live in their hous still make the offer if we did not misfortun
would overtak us as inde ha alwai happen if thei were forgotten
or neglect it is the rent that we pai to the ghost of the king
twice a week we pai it set food and milk and water upon a certain
stone near to the mouth of the vallei
then what happen palka
noth except that the offer is taken
by beggar folk or perchanc by wild creatur
would beggar folk dare to enter that place of death she answer with
contempt or would wild beast take the food and pile the dish neatli
togeth and replac the flat stone on the mouth of the jar of milk
and water as a housewif might oh do not laugh of late thi ha
alwai been done as i who often fetch the vessel know well
have you ever seen these ghost palka
ye onc i saw on of them it wa about two month ago that i pass
the mouth of the vallei after moonris for i had been kept out late
search for a kid which wa lost think that it might be in the
vallei i peer up it as i wa look from round a great rock glide
a ghost she stood still with the moonlight shine on her and gaze
toward the nile i too stood still in the shadow thirti or forti
pace awai then she threw up her arm as though in despair turn and
vanish
she i said then check myself and ask indiffer well what
wa the fashion of thi ghost
so far as i could see that of a young and beauti woman wear
such cloth as we find upon the ancient dead onli wrap more loos
about her
had she aught upon her head palka
ye a band of gold or a crown set upon her hair and about her neck
what seem to be a necklac of green and gold for the moonlight
flash upon it it wa much such a necklac as you wear beneath your
robe hodur
and prai how do you know what i wear palka i ask
by mean of what you lack poor man the ey in my head on night
when you were asleep i had need to pass through your chamber to reach
anoth beyond you had thrown off your outer garment becaus of the
heat and i saw the necklac also i saw a great red sword ly by your
side and note on your bare breast sundri scar such as hunter and
soldier come by all of these thing hodur i thought strang see
that i know you to be noth but a poor blind beggar who gain hi
bread by hi skill upon the harp
there ar beggar who were not alwai beggar palka i said slowli
quit so hodur and there ar great men and rich who sometim appear
to be beggar andmani other thing still have no fear that we shall
steal your necklac or talk about the red sword or the gold with which
your niec hilda weight her garment poor girl she ha all the wai
of a fine ladi on who ha known court as i think you said wa the
case it must be sad for her to have fallen so low still have no fear
hodur and she took my hand and press it in a certain secret fashion
which wa practis among the persecut christian in the east when
thei would reveal themselv to each other then she went awai laugh
as for me i sought martina who had been sleep through the heat and
told her everyth
well she said when i had finish you should give thank to god
olaf sinc without doubt thi ghost is the ladi heliodor so should
jodd i heard her add beneath her breath for in my blind my ear
had grown veri quick
chapter iii
the vallei of the dead king
martina and i had made a plan palka after much coax took us with
her on even when she went to place the accustom offer in the
vallei of the dead inde at first she refus outright to allow us
to accompani her becaus she said onli those who were born in
the villag of kurna had made such offer sinc the dai when the
pharaoh rule and that if stranger share in thi duti it might bring
misfortun we answer howev that if so the misfortun would fall
on us the intrud also we point out that the jar of water and
milk were heavi and as it happen there wa no on from the hamlet
to help to carri them thi night have weigh these fact palka
chang her mind
well she said it is true that i grow fat and after labour all
dai at thi and that have no desir to bear burden like an ass so come
if you will and if you die or evil spirit carri you awai do not
add yourselv to the number of the ghost of whom there ar too mani
hereabout and blame me afterward
on the contrari i said we will make you our heir and i laid a
bag contain some piec of monei upon the tabl
palka who wa a save woman took the monei for i heard it rattl in
her hand hung the jar about my shoulder and gave martina the meat
and corn in a basket the flat cake howev she carri herself on a
wooden trencher becaus as she said she fear lest we should break
them and anger the ghost who like their food to be well serv so
we start and present enter the mouth of that aw vallei which
martina told me look as though it had been riven through the mountain
by lightn stroke and then blast with a curs
up thi dry and desol place which she said wa border on either
side by wall of grei and jag rock we walk in silenc onli i
note that the dog which had follow us from the hous clung close to
our heel and now and again whimper uneasili
the beast see what we cannot see whisper palka in explan
at last we halt and i set down the jar at her bid upon a flat
rock which she call the tabl of offer
see she exclaim to martina those that were place here three
dai ago ar all empti and neatli pile togeth by the ghost i told
hodur that thei did thi but he would not believ me now let us pack
them up in the basket and begon for the sun set and the moon rise
within the half of an hour i would not be here in the dark for ten
piec of pure gold
then go swiftli palka i said for we bide here thi night
ar you mad she ask
not at all i answer a wise man onc told me that if on who is
blind can but come face to face with a spirit he see it and therebi
regain hi sight if you would know the truth that is why i have
wander so far from my own countri to find some land where ghost mai
be met
now i am sure that you ar mad exclaim palka come hilda and
leav thi fool to make trial of hi cure for blind
nai answer martina i must stai with my uncl although i am veri
much afraid if i did not he would beat me afterward
beat you hodur beat a woman oh you ar both mad or perhap you ar
ghost also i have thought it onc or twice who at least am sure that
you ar other than you seem holi jesu thi place grow dark and
i tell you it is full of dead king mai the saint guard you at
the least youll keep high compani at your death farewel whateer
befal blame me not who warn you and she depart at a run the
empti vessel rattl on her back and the dog yap behind her
when she had gone the silenc grew deep
now martina i whisper find some place where we mai hide whenc
you can see thi tabl of offer
she led me to where a fallen rock lai within a few pace and behind it
we sat ourselv down in such a posit that martina could watch the
tabl of offer by the light of the moon
here we wait for a long while it mai have been two hour or three
or four at least i knew that although i could see noth the
solemn of that place sank into my soul i felt as though the dead
were move about me in the silenc i think it wa the same with
martina for although the night wa veri hot in that stifl airless
vallei she shiver at my side at last i felt her start and heard her
whisper
i see a figur it creep from the shadow of the cliff toward the
tabl of offer
what is it like i ask
it is a woman figur drape in white cloth she look about her she
take up the offer and place them in a basket she carri it is
a womanno ghostfor she drink from on of the jar oh now the
moonlight shine upon her face it is that of heliodor
i heard and could restrain myself no longer leap up i ran toward
where i knew the tabl of offer to be i tri to speak but my
voic choke in my throat the woman saw or heard me come through the
shadow at least utter a low cry she fled awai for i caught the
sound of her feet on the rock and sand then i trip over a stone and
fell down
in a moment martina wa at my side
truli you ar foolish olaf she said did you think that the ladi
heliodor would know you at night chang as you ar and in thi garb
that you must rush at her like an angri bull now she ha gone and
perchanc we shall never find her more why did you not speak to her
becaus my voic choke within me oh blame me not martina if you
knew what it is to love as i do and after so mani fear and sorrow
i trust that i should know also how to control my love broke in
martina sharpli come wast no more time in talk let us search
then she took me by the hand and led me to where she had last seen
heliodor
she ha vanish awai she said here is noth but rock
it cannot be i answer oh that i had my ey again if for an
hour i who wa the best tracker in jutland see if no stone ha been
stir martina the sand will be damper where it ha lain
she left me and present return
i have found someth she said when heliodor fled she still held
her basket which from the look of it wa last us by the pharaoh at
least on of the cake ha fallen from or through it come
she led me to the cliff and up it to perhap twice the height of a man
then round a project rock
here is a hole she said such as jackal might make perchanc it
lead into on of the old tomb whereof the mouth is seal it wa
on the edg of the hole that i found the cake therefor doubtless
heliodor went down it now what shall we do
follow i think where is it
nai i go first give me your hand olaf and lie upon your breast
i did so and present felt the weight of martina swing on my arm
leav go she said faintli like on who is afraid
i obei though with doubt and heard her feet strike upon some floor
thank be the saint all is well she said for aught i knew thi
hole might have been as deep as that in the chamber of the pit let
yourself down it feet first and drop ti but shallow
i did so and found myself besid martina
now in the dark you ar the better guid she whisper lead
on ill follow hold to your robe
so i crept forward warili and safe as the blind can do till
present she exclaim
halt here is light again i think that the roof of the tomb for by
the paint on the wall such it must be ha fallen in it seem
to be a kind of central chamber out of which run great galleri that
slope downward and ar full of bat ah on of them is caught in
my hair olaf i will go no farther i fear bat more than ghost or
anyth in the world
now i consid a while till a thought struck me on my back wa my
beggar harp i unslung it and swept it chord and wild and sad thei
sound in that solemn place then i began to sing an old song that
twice or thrice i had sung with heliodor in byzantium thi song told
of a lover seek hi mistress it wa for two voic sinc in the
song the mistress answer vers for vers here ar those of the line
that i rememb or rather the spirit of them render into english i
sang the first vers and wait
dear maid of mine
i bid my string
beat on thy shrine
with music wing
palac or cell
a shrine i see
if there thou dwell
and answer me
there wa no answer so i sang the second vers and onc more wait
on thy love fire
my passion breath
wind of desir
thy incens wreath
greet to thee
or soon or late
i bond or free
am dedic
and from somewher far awai in the recess of that great cave came the
answer stroph
o love sublim
and undismai
no touch of time
upon thee laid
that that is thine
end the quest
i seek my shrine
upon thy breast
then i laid down the harp
at last a voic the voic of heliodor speak whenc i knew not
ask
do the dead sing or is it a live man and if so how is that man
name
a live man i repli and he is name olaf son of thorvald
or otherwis michael that name wa given him in the cathedr at
byzantium where first hi ey fell on a certain heliodor daughter of
maga the egyptian whom now he seek
i heard the sound of footstep creep toward me and heliodor voic
sai
let me see your face you who name yourself olaf for know that in
these haunt tomb ghost and vision and mock voic plai strang
trick why do you hide your face you who call yourself olaf
becaus the ey ar gone from it heliodor iren rob it of the
ey from jealousi of you swear that never more should thei behold
your beauti perchanc you would not wish to come too near to an eyeless
man wrap in a beggar robe
she lookedi felt her look she sobbedi heard her sob and then her
arm were about me and her lip were press upon my own
so at length came joi such as i cannot tell the joi of lost love found
again
a while went by how long i know not and at last i said
where is martina it is time we left thi place
martina she exclaim do you mean iren ladi and is she here if
so how come she to be travel with you olaf
as the best friend man ever had heliodor as on who clung to him
in hi ruin and save him from a cruel death as on who ha risk her
life to help him in hi desper search and without whom that search
had fail
then mai god reward her olaf for i did not know there were such women
in the world ladi martina where ar you ladi martina
thrice she cri the word and at the third time an answer came from
the shadow at a distanc
i am here said martina voic with a littl yawn i wa weari and
have slept while you two greet each other well met at last ladi
heliodor see i have brought you back your olaf blind it is true but
otherwis lack noth of health and strength and station
then heliodor ran to her and kiss first her hand and next her lip
in after dai she told me that for those of on who had been sleep
the ey of martina seem to be strang wet and red but if thi were
so her voic trembl not at all
truli you two should give thank to god she said who ha brought
you togeth again in so wondrou a fashion as i do on your behalf from
the bottom of my heart yet you ar still hem round by danger mani
and great what now olaf will you becom a ghost also and dwell here
in the tomb with heliodor and if so what tale shall i tell to palka
and the rest
not so i answer i think it will be best that we should return to
kurna heliodor must plai her part as the spirit of a queen till we can
hire some boat and escap with her down the nile
never she cri i cannot i cannot have come togeth we must
separ no more oh olaf you do not know what a life ha been mine
dure all these dread month when i escap from musa by stab
the eunuch who wa in charg of me for which hideou deed mai i be
forgiven and i felt her shudder at my side i fled i knew not whither
till i found myself in thi vallei where i hid till the night wa gone
then at daybreak i peep out from the mouth of the vallei and saw the
moslem search for me but as yet a long wai off also now i knew
thi vallei it wa that to which my father had brought me as a child
when he came to search for the buryingplac of hi ancestor the
pharaoh which record he had read told him wa here i rememb
everyth where the tomb should be how we had enter it through a
hole how we had found the mummi of a royal ladi whose face wa cover
with a gild mask and on her breast the necklac which i wear
i ran along the vallei search the left side of it with my ey
till i saw a flat stone which i knew again it wa call the tabl of
offer i wa sure that the hole by which we had enter the tomb
wa quit near to thi stone and a littl abov it in the face of the
cliff i climb i found what seem to be the hole though of thi i
could not be certain i crept down it till it came to an end and
then in my terror hung by my hand and drop into the dark
not know whither i fell or care over much if i were kill as it
chanc it wa but a littl wai and find myself unhurt i crawl
along the cavern till i reach thi place where there is light for
here the roof of the cave ha fallen in while i crouch amid the rock
i heard the voic of the soldier abov me heard their offic also
bid them bring rope and torch to the left of where you stand
there is a slope passag that run down to the great central chamber
where sleep some mighti king and out of thi passag open other
chamber into the first of these the light of the morn sun struggl
feebli i enter it seek somewher to hide myself and saw a
paint coffin ly on the floor near to the marbl sarcophagu from
which it had been drag it wa that in which we had found the bodi
of my ancestress but sinc then thiev had been in thi place we
had left the coffin in the sarcophagu and the mummi in the coffin and
replac their lid now the mummi lai on the floor half unwrap and
broken in two beneath the breast moreov the face which i rememb
as be so like my own wa gone to dust so that there remain of
it noth but a skull to which hung tress of long black hair as
inde you mai see for yourself
by the side of the bodi wa the gild mask with black and stare
ey and the paint breastpiec of stiff linen neither of which the
thiev had found worth steal
i look and a thought came to me lift the mummi i thrust it
into the sarcophagu all of it save the gild mask and the paint
breastpiec of stiff linen then i laid myself down in the coffin of
which the lid still ly crosswis hid me to the waist and drew the
gild mask and paint breastpiec over my head and bosom scarc
wa it done when the soldier enter by now the reflect sunlight
had fade from the place leav it in deep shadow but some of the men
held burn torch made from splinter of old coffin that were full
of pitch
feet have pass here i saw the mark of them in the dust said the
offic she mai have hidden in thi place search search it will go
hard with us if we return to musa to tell him that he ha lost hi toi
thei look into the sarcophagu and saw the broken mummi inde on
of them lift it unwillingli enough and let it fall again sai
grimli
musa would scarc care for thi companion though in her dai she mai
have been fair enough
then thei came to the coffin
here anoth exclaim the soldier and on with a gold face
allah how it ey stare
pull it out said the offic
let that be your task answer the man ill defil myself with no
more corps
the offic came and look what a haunt hole is thi full of the
ghost of idol worshipp or so i think he said those ey stare
curs at us well the christian maid is not here on befor the
torch fail
then thei went leav me the paint linen creak upon my breast as
i breath again
till nightfal i lai in that coffin fear lest thei should return
and i tell you olaf that strang dream came to me there for i think
i swoon or slept in that narrow bed ye dream of the past which
you shall hear on dai if we live for thei seem to have to do with you
and me ay i thought that the dead woman in the sarcophagu at my side
awok and told them to me at length i rose and crept back to thi
place where we stand for here i could see the friendli light and be
outworn laid me down and slept
at the first break of dai i crawl from the tomb follow that same
road by which i had enter though i found it hard to climb up through
the entranc hole
no live thing wa to be seen in the vallei except a great night bird
flit to it haunt i wa parch with thirst and know that in
thi dry place i soon must perish i glide from rock to rock toward
the mouth of the vallei think to find some other grave or cranni
where i might lie hid till night came again and i could descend to the
plain and drink but olaf befor i had gone mani step i discov
fresh food milk and water laid upon a rock and though i fear lest
thei might be poison at and drank of them when i knew that thei
were wholesom i thought that some friend must have set them there to
satisfi my want though i knew not who the friend could be afterward
i learn that thi food wa an offer to the ghost of the dead
among our forefath in forgotten gener it wa i know the
custom to make such offer sinc in their blind thei believ
that the spirt of their belov need susten as their bodi onc
had done doubtless the memori of the rite still surviv at least
to thi dai the offer ar made inde when it wa found that thei
were not made in vain more and more of them were brought so that i
have lack noth
here then i have dwelt for mani moon among the dust of men depart
onli now and again wander out at night onc or twice folk have seen
me when i ventur to the plain and i have been tempt to speak to
them and ask their help but alwai thei fled awai believ me to
be the ghost of some bygon queen inde to speak truth olaf thi
companionship with spirit for spirit do dwell in these tombsi have
seen them i tell you i have seen themha so work upon my soul that
at time i feel as though i were alreadi of their compani moreov i
knew that i could not live long the loneli wa suck up my life
as the dry sand suck water had you not come olaf within some few
dai or week i should have di
now i spoke for the first time sai
and did you wish to die heliodor
no befor the war between musa and my father maga new came to us
from byzantium that iren had kill you all believ it save i who
did not believ
why not heliodor
becaus i could not feel that you were dead therefor i fought for my
life who otherwis after we were conquer and ruin and my father
wa slain fight nobli should have stab not that eunuch but
myself then later in thi tomb i came to know that you were not dead
the other lost on i could feel about me from time to time but you
never you who would have been the first to seek me when my soul wa
open to such whisper so i live on when all els would have di
becaus hope burn in me like a lamp unquench and at last you
came oh at last you came
chapter iv
the caliph harun
here there is an absolut blank in my stori on of those wall of
oblivion of which i have spoken seem to be built across it path it is

bosom of a mountain side and there vanish from the ken of man what

all the truth olaf redsword yonder and i have long been affianc
blind though he is he sought me through great danger ay and found
me would you part us at the last in the name of the god we both
worship and of your mother i prai you let us go
by the prophet that i would do ladi onli then i fear me that i
should let my head go from it shoulder also there ar too mani in
thi secret for it to bide there long if i did as you desir nai
you must to the emir all three of younot musa but to hi rival
obaidallah who love him littl and by the decre of the caliph onc
again rule egypt be sure that in a matter between you and musa you
will meet with justic from obaidallah come now fear noth to
where we mai find you all garment more befit to your station than
those mummer robe
so a guard wa form round us and we went as my feet touch the quai
i heard a sound of angri voic follow by groan and a splash in the
water
what is that i ask of yusuf
i think gener that your servant from the diana have settl some
account that thei had with the drunken dog who wa so good as to bark
out your name to me but with your leav i will not look to make
sure
god pardon him as yet i cannot i mutter and march on
we stood whether on that dai or anoth i do not know in some hall of
judgment martina whisper to me that a small dark man wa seat in
the chair of state and about him priest and other thi wa the emir
obaidallah musa that had been emir who she said wa fat and sullen
wa there also and whenev hi glanc fell upon heliodor i felt her
shiver at my side so wa the patriarch politian who plead our caus
the case wa long so long that be courteou as ever thei gave us
cushion to sit on also in an interv food and sherbet
musa claim heliodor as hi slave an offic who prosecut claim
that allah have given me their enemi and a wellknown gener who
had done them much damag into their hand i should be put to death
politian answer on behalf of all of us sai that we had harm no
man he ad that as there wa a truce between the christian and the
moslem i could not be made to suffer the penalti of war in a time of
peac who had come to egypt but to seek a maid to whom i wa affianc
moreov that even if it were so the murder of prison wa not on
of those penalti
the emir listen to all but said littl at length howev he ask
whether we were will to becom moslem sinc if so he thought that
we might go free we answer that we were not will
then it would seem he said that the ladi heliodor have been
taken in war must be treat as a prison of war the onli question
be to whom she belong
now musa interrupt angrili shout out that as to thi there wa no
doubt sinc she belong to him who had captur her dure hi tenur
of offic
the emir thought a while and we wait trembl at last he gave
judgment sai
the gener olaf the blind who in byzantium wa known as olaf
redsword or as michael and who while in the servic of the empress
iren often made war against the follow of the prophet but who
afterward lost hi ey at the hand of thi same evil woman is a man
of whom all the world ha heard particularli have we moslem heard of
him see that as governor of lesbo in recent dai he inflict a
great defeat upon our navi slai mani thousand and take other
prison but as it chanc god who bide hi time to work justic set
a bait for him in the shape of a fair woman on thi bait he ha been
hook notwithstand all hi skill and cun and deliv into
our hand have come into egypt disguis as a beggar in order to seek
out that woman still as he is so famou a man and as at present there
is a truce between us and the empir of the east which truce rais
certain doubt point of high polici i decre that hi case be
remit to the caliph harunalrashid my master and that he be
convei to baghdad there to await judgment with him will go the woman
whom he alleg to be hi niec but who as we ar inform wa on of
the waitingladi of the empress iren against her there is noth to
be said save that she mai be a byzantin spy
now i come to the matter of the ladi heliodor who is report to be
the wife or the lover or the affianc of thi gener olaf a question
of which god alon know the truth thi ladi heliodor is a person of
high descent and ancient race she is the onli child of the late princ
maga who claim to have the blood of the old pharaoh in hi vein
and who within thi year wa defeat and slain by my predecessor
in offic the emir musa the said emir have captur the ladi
heliodor purpos to place her in hi harem as he had a right to
do see that she refus the bless of the faith as it chanc
howev she escap from him as it is told by stab the eunuch in
charg of her at least it is certain that thi eunuch wa found dead
though by whom he wa kill is not certain now that she ha been
taken again the lord musa claim the woman as hi spoil and demand
that i should hand her over to him yet it seem to me that if she is
the spoil of anyon she belong to the emir govern egypt at the date
of her recaptur it wa onli by virtu of hi offic as emir and not
by gift purchas or marriag contract that the lord musa came into
possess of her which possess wa void by her flight befor she
wa ad to hi household and he acquir ani natur right over her
in accord with our law now for my part i as emir make no claim
to thi woman hold it a hate thing befor god to forc on into
my household who ha no wish to dwell there especi when i know
her to be marri or affianc to anoth man still as here also
ar involv high question of law i command that the ladi heliodor
daughter of the late princ maga shall also be convei with all
courtesi and honour to the caliph harun at baghdad there to abid hi
judgment of her case the matter is finish let the offic concern
carri out my decre and answer for the safeti of these prison with
their live
the matter is not finish shout the exemir musa you
obaidallah have utter thi fals judgment becaus your heart is black
toward me whom you have displac
then appeal against it said obaidallah but know that if you attempt
to lai hand upon thi ladi my order ar that you be cut down as an
enemi to the law patriarch of the christian you sail for baghdad to
visit the caliph at hi request in a ship that he ha sent for you into
your hand i give these prison under guard know that you will
deal well with them who ar of your fals faith to you also who have
the caliph ear allah know why i will entrust letter make true
report of all thi matter let proper provis be made for the comfort
of the gener olaf and of those with him musa mai your greet at
the court of baghdad be such as you deserv meanwhil ceas to troubl
me
at the door of that hall i wa separ from heliodor and martina
and led to some hous or prison where i wa given a larg room with
servant to wait upon me here i slept that night and on the morrow
ask when we sail for beirut on our wai to baghdad the chief of the
servant answer that he did not know dure that dai i wa visit
by yusuf the offic who had captur us on board the diana he also
told me that he did not know when we sail but certainli it would not
be for some dai further he said that i need have no fear for the ladi
heliodor and martina as thei were well treat in some other place
then he led me into a great garden where he said i wa at liberti to
walk whenev i pleas
thu began perhap the most dread time of wait and suspens in all
thi life of mine see that it wa the longest everi few dai the
offic yusuf would visit me and talk of mani matter for we becam
friend onli of heliodor and martina he could or would tell me
noth nor of when we were to set out on our journei to baghdad
i ask to be allow to speak with the patriarch politian but he
answer that thi wa imposs as he had been call awai from
alexandria for a littl while nor could i have audienc with the emir
obaidallah for he too had been call awai
now my heart wa fill with terror for i fear lest in thi wai
or in that heliodor had fallen into the hand of the accurs musa i
prai yusuf to tell me the truth of the matter whereon he swore by the
prophet that she wa safe but would sai no more nor did thi comfort
me much sinc for aught i knew he might mean she wa safe in death
i wa awar further that the moslem held it no crime to deceiv an
infidel week wa ad to week and still i languish in thi rich
prison the best of garment and food were brought to me i wa even
given wine kind hand tend me and led me from place to place i
lack noth except freedom and the truth doubt and fear prei upon
my heart till at length i fell ill and scarc care to walk in the
garden on dai when yusuf visit me i told him that he would not need
to come mani more time sinc i felt that i wa go to die
do not die he answer sinc then perchanc you will find you have
done so in vain and he left me
on the follow even he return and told me that he had brought
a physician to see me a certain mahom who wa stand befor me
although i had no hope from ani physician i prai thi mahom to be
seat whereon yusuf left us close the door behind him
be pleas to set out your case gener olaf said mahom in a
grave quiet voic for know that i am sent by the caliph himself to
minist to you
how can that be see that he is in baghdad i answer still i
told him my ailment
when i had finish he said
i perceiv that you suffer more from your mind than from your bodi be
so good now as to repeat to me the tale of your life of which i have
alreadi heard someth tell me especi of those part of it which
have to do with the ladi heliodor daughter of maga of your blind
by iren for her sake and of your discoveri of her in egypt where you
sought her disguis as a beggar
why should i tell you all my stori sir
that i mai know how to heal you of your sick also gener olaf i
will be frank with you i am more than a mere physician i have certain
power under the caliph seal and it will be wise on your part to open
all your heart to me
now i reflect that there could be littl harm in repeat to thi
strang doctor what so mani alreadi knew so i told him everyth and
the tale wa long
wondrou most wondrou said the gravevo physician when i had
finish yet to me the strangest part of your histori is that plai
therein by the ladi martina had she been your lover now on might
have understoodperhap and he paus
sir physician i answer the ladi martina ha been and is no more
than my friend
ah now i see new virtu in your religion sinc we moslem do not
find such friend among those women who ar neither our mother nor our
sister evid the christian faith must have power to chang the
natur of women which i thought to be imposs well gener olaf i
will consid of your case and i mai tell you that i have good hope of
find a medicin by which it can be cure all save your sight which
in thi world god himself cannot give back to you now i have a favour
to ask i see that in thi room of your there is a curtain hide the
bed of the servant who sleep with you i desir to see anoth patient
here and that thi patient should not see you of your good will
you sit upon the bed behind that curtain and will you swear to me on
your honour as a soldier that whatev you mai hear you will in no wai
reveal yourself
sure that is if it is noth which will bring disgrac upon my head
or name
it will be noth to bring disgrac on your head or name gener
olaf though perhap it mai bring some sorrow to your heart as yet i
cannot sai
my heart is too full of sorrow to hold more i answer
then he led me down to the guard bed on which i sat myself down
be strang interest in thi plai he drew the curtain in front of
me and i heard him return to the centr of the room and clap hi hand
someon enter sai
high lord your will
silenc he exclaim and began to whisper order while i wonder
what kind of a physician thi might be who wa address as high lord
the servant went and after a while of wait that seem long onc
more the door wa open and i heard the sweep of a woman dress upon
the carpet
be seat ladi said the grave voic of the physician for i have
word to sai to you
sir i obei answer anoth voic at the sound of which my heart
stood still it wa that of heliodor
ladi went on the physician as my robe will tell you i am a doctor
of medicin also as it chanc i am someth more name an envoi
appoint by the caliph harunalrashid have full power to deal
with your case here ar my credenti if you care to read them and i
heard a crackl as of parchment be unfold
sir answer heliodor i will read the letter later for the
present i accept your word onli i would ask on question if it pleas
you to answer why have not i and the gener olaf been convei to
the presenc of the caliph himself as wa command by the emir
obaidallah
ladi becaus it wa not conveni to the caliph to receiv you
sinc as it chanc at present he is move from place to place upon the
busi of the state therefor as you will find in the write he
ha appoint me to deal with your matter now ladi the caliph and i
hi servant know all your stori from lip which even you would trust
you ar betroth to a certain enemi of hi a northman name olaf
redsword or michael who wa blind by the empress iren for some
offenc against her but wa afterward appoint by her son constantin
to be governor of the isl of lesbo thi olaf by the will of god
inflict a heavi defeat upon the forc of the caliph which he had sent
to take lesbo then by the good of god he wander to egypt in
search of you with the result that both of you were taken prison
ladi it will be clear to you that have thi wild hawk olaf in hi
hand the caliph would scarc let him go again to prei upon the
moslem though whether he will kill him or make of him a slave as yet i
do not know nai hear me out befor you speak the caliph ha been told
of your wondrou beauti and as i see even less than the truth also he
ha heard of the high spirit which you show in the coptic rise when
your father the princ maga wa slain and of how you escap out
of the hand of the emir musa the fat and were not afraid to dwell for
month alon in the tomb of the ancient dead now the caliph be
move in hi heart by your sad plight and all that he ha heard
concern you command me to make you an offer
the offer is that you should come to hi court and there be instruct
for a while by hi learn men in the truth of religion then if it
pleas you to adopt islam he will take you as on of hi wive and
if it doe not pleas you will add you to hi harem sinc it is not
law for him to marri a woman who remain a christian in either case
he will make on you a settlement of properti to the valu of that which
belong to your father the princ maga reflect well befor you
answer your choic li between the memori of a blind man whom i think
you will never see again and the high place of on of the wive of the
greatest sovereign of the earth
sir befor i answer i would put a question to you why do you sai the
memori of a blind man
becaus ladi a rumour ha reach me which i desir to hold back
from you but which now you forc me to repeat it is that thi gener
olaf ha in truth alreadi pass the gate of death
then sir she answer with a littl sob it behov me to follow
him through that gate
that will happen when it pleas god meanwhil what is your answer
sir my answer is that i a poor christian prison a victim of war
and fate thank the caliph harunalrashid for the honour and the
benefit he would shower on me and with humil declin them
so be it ladi the caliph is not a man who would wish to forc your
inclin still thi be so i am charg to sai he bid you
rememb that you were taken prison in war by the emir musa he hold
that subject to hi own prior right which he waiv you ar the
properti of the emir musa under a just interpret of the law yet
he would be merci as god is merci and therefor he give you the
choic of three thing the first of these is that you adopt islam with
a faith heart and go free
that i refus as i have refus it befor said heliodor
the second is he continu that you enter the harem of the emir
musa
that i refus also
and the third and last is that have thrust asid hi merci you
suffer the common fate of a captur christian who persist in error
and die
that i accept said heliodor
you accept death in the splendour of your youth and beauti you accept
death he said with a note of wonder in hi voic truli you ar
greatheart and the caliph will griev when he learn hi loss as
i do now yet i have my order for which my head must answer ladi if
you die it must be here and now do you still choos death
ye she said in a low voic
behold thi cup he went on and thi draught which i pour into it
and i heard the sound of liquid flow present i shall ask you to
drink of it and then after a littl while sai the half of an hour
you will fall asleep to wake in whatev world god ha appoint to
the idol worshipp of the cross you will suffer no pain and no fear
inde mayb the draught will bring you joi
then give it me said heliodor faintli i will drink at onc and
have done
then it wa that i came out from behind my curtain and grope my wai
toward them
sir physician or sir envoi of the caliph harun i said but for the
moment went no further sinc with a low cry heliodor cast herself
upon my breast and stop my lip with her
hush till i have spoken i whisper place my arm about her then
continu i swore to you just now that i would not reveal myself
unless i heard aught which would bring disgrac on my head or name to
stand still behind yonder curtain while my betroth is poison at your
hand would bring disgrac upon my head and name so black that not
all the sea of all the world could wash it awai sai physician doe
yonder cup hold enough of death for both of us
ye gener olaf and if you choos to share it i think the caliph
will be glad sinc he love not the kill of brave men onli it must
be now and without more word you can talk for a littl afterward
befor the sleep take you
so be it i said sinc i must die as i heard you decre but now it
is no crime to die thu or at least ill risk it who have on to guard
upon that road drink belov a littl less than half sinc i am the
stronger then give me the cup
husband i pledg you she said and drank thrust the cup into my
hand
i too lift it to my lip lo it wa empti
oh most cruel of thiev i cri you have stolen all
ay she answer shall i see you swallow poison befor my ey i
die but perchanc god mai save you yet
not so heliodor i cri again and turn began to grope my wai
to the windowplac which i knew wa far from the ground sinc i had
no weapon that would serv my turn
in an instant as i thrust the lattic open i felt two strong arm cast
about me and heard the physician exclaim
come ladi help me with thi madman lest he do himself a mischief
she seiz me also and we struggl togeth all three of us the door
burst open and i wa drag back into the centr of the room
olaf redsword the blind gener of the christian said the
physician in a new voic on that wa full of majesti and command
i who speak to you am no doctor of medicin and no envoi i am
harunalrashid caliph of the faith is it not so my servant
it is so caliph peal the answer from mani throat
hearken then to the decre of harunalrashid learn both of you that
all which ha pass between us wa but a plai that i have plai to
test the love and faith of you twain ladi heliodor be at eas
you have drunk noth save water distil with rose and no sleep
shall fall on you save that which natur bring to happi ladi i
tell you that have seen what i have seen and heard what i have heard
rather would i stand in the place of that blind man tonight than be
sovereign of the east truli i knew not that love such as your wa to
be met with in the world i sai that when i saw you drain the cup in a
last poor struggl to drive back the death that threaten thi olaf my
own heart went out in love for you yet have no fear sinc my love is
of a kind that would not rob you of your love but rather would bring it
to a rich and gloriou blossom in the sunshin of my favour wondrou is
the tale of the woo of you twain and happi shall be it end gener
olaf you conquer me in war and dealt with those of my servant who
fell into your hand accord to the nobl of your heart shall
i then be outdon in generos by on whom a while ago i should have
name a christian dog not so let the high priest of the christian
politian be brought hither he stand without and with him the ladi
name martina who wa the empress iren waitingwoman
the messeng went and there follow a silenc there ar time when
the heart is too full for word at least heliodor and i found noth
to sai to each other we onli clasp each other hand and wait
at length the door open and i heard the eager bustl step of
politian also anoth glide step which i knew for that of martina
she came to me she kiss me on the brow and whisper into my ear
so all is well at last as i knew it would be and now olafand now
olaf you ar about to be marri ye at onc andi wish you joi
her word were simpl enough yet thei kindl in my heart a light by
which it saw mani thing
martina i said if i have live to reach thi hour under god it is
through you martina thei sai that each of us ha a guardian angel in
heaven and if that be so mine ha come to earth yet in heaven alon
shall i learn to thank her as i ought
then suddenli martina wa sob on my breast after which i rememb
onli that heliodor help me to wipe awai her tear while in the
background i heard the caliph sai to himself in hi deep voic
wondrou wondrou by allah these christian ar a strang folk how
far wiser is our law for then he could have marri both of them and
all three would have been happi truli he who decre that it should be
so knew the heart of man and woman and wa a prophet sent by god nai
answer me not friend politian sinc on matter of religion we have
agre that we will never argu do your offic accord to your unholi
rite and i and my servant will watch prai that the evil on mai
be absent from the servic oh silenc silenc have i not said that
we will not argu on subject of religion to your busi man
so politian drew us togeth to the other end of the chamber and there
wed us as best he might with martina for wit and the solemn moslem
for congreg
when it wa over harun command my wife to lead me befor him
here is a marriag gift for you gener olaf he said on i think
that you will valu more than ani other and he hand me someth
sharp and heavi
i felt it hilt and blade and knew it for the wander sword ye
my own red sword from which i took my name that the command of the
faith now restor to me and with it my place and freedom i took
it and sai no word with that same sword gave to him the tripl
salut due to a sovereign
instantli i heard harun scimitar the scimitar that wa famou
throughout the east rattl as it left it scabbard as did the
scimitar of all those who attend on him and knew that there wa
be return to me the salut which a sovereign give to a gener in
high command then the caliph spoke again

race and newmad wife of a gallant man for the second time tonight
take thi cup of gold but let that which li within it adorn your
breast in memori of harun queen of old have worn those jewel but

heliodor took the cup and in her trembl hand i heard the priceless
gem that fill it clink against it side onc more the caliph spoke
a gift for you also ladi martina take thi ring from my hand and
place it on your own it seem a small thing doe it not yet someth

ye alon at last and safe
chapter v
iren prayer
year had gone by i know not how mani but onli that much had happen
in them for a while iren and young constantin were joint ruler
of the empir then thei quarrel again and constantin afraid of
treacheri fled with hi friend in a ship after an attempt had been
made to seiz hi person he purpos to join hi legion in asia or so
it wa said and make war upon hi mother but those friend of hi upon
the ship were traitor who fear iren vengeanc or perhap hi
own sinc she threaten to tell him all the truth concern them
seiz constantin and deliv him up to iren she the mother who
bore him caus him to be taken to the purpl porphyri chamber in the
palac that chamber in which as the firstborn of an emperor he saw
the light and there rob him of light for ever
ye stauraciu and hi butcher blind constantin as i had been
blind onli it wa told that thei drove their knive deeper so that he
di but other sai that he live on a prison unknown unheed as
those uncl of hi whom he had blind and who onc were in my charg
had live till in greec the assassin dagger found their heart if
so oh what a fate wa hi
afterward for five year iren reign alon in glori while
stauraciu my godfath and hi brother eunuch aetiu strove
against each other to be first minist of the crown aetiu won and
not content with all he had plot that hi rel niceta who held
the place of captain of the guard which onc i fill should be name
successor to the throne then at last the nobl rebel and elect
on of their number nicephoru as emperor seiz iren in her privat
hous of eleutheriu where she lai sick and crown nicephoru in st
sophia next dai he visit iren when fear the worst and broken
by ill she bought a promis of safeti by reveal to him all her
hoard treasur
thu fell iren the mighti empress of the eastern empir
now dure all these year heliodor and i were left in peac at lesbo
i wa not depos from my governorship of that isl which prosper
greatli under my rule even iren estat which constantin had given
me were not taken awai at the appoint time i remit the
tribut due ye and ad to the sum and receiv back the offici
acknowledg sign by the empress and with it the offici thank
but with these never came either letter or messag yet it is evid
she knew that i wa marri for to heliodor did come a messag and
with it a gift the gift wa that necklac and those other ornament
which iren had caus to be made in an exact like of the string
of golden shell separ by emerald beetl on half of which i had
taken from the grave of the wander at aar and the other half of which
wa worn by heliodor
so much of the gift the messag wa that she who own the necklac
might wish to have the rest of the set to it were ad the word that
a certain gener had been wrong when he prophesi that the wear
of thi necklac by ani woman save on would bring ill fortun to the
wearer sinc from the dai it hung about iren neck even that which
seem to be bad fortun had turn to good thu she had escap the
most evil thing in the world name anoth husband and had becom
the first woman in the world
these word which were written on a piec of sheepskin seal up and
address to the ladi heliodor but unsign i thought of the most
evil omen sinc boast alwai seem to be hate to the power
that decre our fate so inde thei prove to be
on a certain dai in earli summerit wa the anniversari of my marriag
in egyptheliodor and i had dine with but two guest those guest
were jodd the great northman my lieuten and hi wife martina for
within a year of our return to lesbo jodd and martina had marri it
come back to me that there wa troubl about the busi but that
when jodd gave out that either she must marri him or that he would sail
back to hi northern land bid goodby to us all for ever martina
gave wai i think that heliodor manag the matter in some fashion of
her own after the birth of our firstborn son how i held it best never
to inquir at least it wa manag and the marriag turn out well
enough in the end although at first martina wa moodi at time and
somewhat sharp of tongu with jodd then thei had a babi which di and
thi dead child drew them closer togeth than it might have done had it
live at ani rate from that time forward martina grew more gentl with
jodd and when other children were born thei seem happi togeth
well we four had dine and it come to me that our talk turn upon
the caliph harun and hi wonder good to us whom as christian he
wa bound to despis and hate heliodor told me then for the first time
how she wa glad he had made it clear so soon that what she drank from
the gold cup which now stood upon our tabl wa no more than rose water
so strong is the work of the mind that alreadi she had begun to feel
as though poison were numb her heart and cloud her brain and
wa sure that soon she would have fallen into the sleep which harun had
warn her would end in death
had he been a true physician he would have known that thi might be
so and that such grim jest ar veri danger i said then i ad
for i did not wish to dwell longer upon a scene the memori of which wa
dread to me although it had end well
tell us martina is it true that those rich possess of your in
alexandria which the caliph gave you ar sold
ye olaf she answer to a compani of greek merchant and not
so ill the contract wa sign but yesterdai it wa my wish that we
should leav lesbo and go to live in thi place as we might have done
with safeti under harun sign firman but jodd here refus
ay said jodd in hi big voic am i on to dwell among moslem
and make monei out of trade and garden in howev fine a hous why i
should have been fight with these prophetworshipp within a month
and had my throat cut moreov how could i bear to be separ from
my gener and whatev she mai think how could martina bear to lose
sight of her godson why olaf i tell you that although you ar
marri and she is marri she still think twice as much of you as she
doe of me oh blind man dog onc blind man dog alwai look
not so angri martina why i wonder doe the truth alwai make women
angri and he burst into on of hi great laugh

oh what marplot of a devil rule our destini he who fashion those

cannot be alter the augusta of the empir of the east must plead
with the man who reject her for sight or rather for her life you

just such a command as you gave to those who blind your son
constantin mutter jodd beneath hi breath
that is what is meant you ar to murder me and olaf im not fit

be what you ar no pomp or power would ever pai you for the deed be
true to your own high heart and spare me see i who for so long wa
the ruler of mani kingdom kneel to you and prai you to spare me and
cast herself down upon her knee she laid her head upon my feet and
wept
all that scene come back to me with a strang and terribl vivid
although i had no sight to aid me in it detail save the sight of my
soul i rememb that the wonder and horror of it pierc me through and
through the stab of the dagger in my ey wa not more sharp there wa
i olaf a mere gentleman of the north seat in my chair of offic
and there befor me her mighti head bow upon my feet knelt the
empress of the earth plead for her life in truth all histori could
show few stranger scene what wa i to do if i yield to her piteou
prayer it wa probabl that my own life and those of my wife and
children would pai the price yet how could i clap my hand in their
eastern fashion and summon the execution to pierc those stream
ey of her rise augusta i said for in thi extrem of her
shame i gave her back her titl and tell me you who ar accustom to
such matter how i can spare you who deal with the live of other as
well as with my own
i thank you for that name she said as she struggl to her feet
iv heard it shout by ten of thousand in the circu and from the
throat of armi but never yet ha it been half so sweet to me as now
from lip that have no need to utter it in time bygon id have paid
you for thi servic with a provinc but now iren is so poor that
like some humbl beggarwoman she can but give her thank still
repeat it no more for next time it will sound bitter what did you ask
how you could save me wa it not well the thing seem simpl in all
that letter from nicephoru there is no direct command that you should
blind me the fellow sai that you ar to treat me as i treat you
and as i treat constantin the emperorbecaus i must well i
imprison both of you imprison me and you fulfil the mandat he sai
that if i die you ar to report it which show that he doe not mean
that i must die oh the road of escap is easi should you desir
to travel it if you do not so desir then olaf i prai you as a last
favour not to hand me over to common men i see that by your side still
hang that red sword of your wherewith onc i threaten you when you
refus me at byzantium draw it olaf and thi time ill guid it
edg across my throat so you will pleas nicephoru and win the reward
that iren can no longer give baptis in her blood what earthli glori
is there to which you might not yet attain you who had dare to lai
hand upon the anoint flesh that even her worst foe have fear to
touch lest god sudden curs should strike them dead
so she went on pour out word with the strang eloqu that she
could command at time till i grew bewild she who had live in
light and luxuri who had love the vision of all bright and gloriou
thing wa plead for her sight to the man whom she had rob of
sight that he might never more behold the young beauti of her rival she
who had imagin to know the great of her sin wa plead to
be spare the death she dare not face she wa plead to me who for
year had been her faith soldier the captain of her own guard sworn
to protect her from the slightest ill me upon whom for a while it had
pleas her to lavish the wild passion of her imperi heart who onc
had almost lovedwho inde had kiss her on the lip
my order were definit i wa command to blind thi woman and to kill
her in the blind which in truth i who had power of life and
death i who rule over thi island like a king by virtu of the royal
commiss could do without question ask if i fail to fulfil
those order i must be prepar to pai the price as if i did fulfil
them i might expect a high reward probabl the governorship of some
great provinc of the empir thi wa no common prison she wa the
exempress a mighti woman to whom ten of thousand or perhap million
still look for help and leadership it wa necessari to those who
had seiz her place and power that she should be render incap of
rule it wa desir to them that she should die yet so delic
were the scale pois between them and the adher of iren among
whom were number all the great princ of the church that thei
themselv did not dare to inflict mutil or death upon her thei
fear lest it should be follow by a storm of wrath that would shake
nicephoru from hi throne and involv them in hi ruin
so thei sent her to me the governor of a distant depend the man
whom thei knew she had wickedli wrong be certain that her tongu
which it wa said could turn the heart of all men would never soften
mine then afterward thei would declar that the warrant wa a forgeri
that i had but wreak a privat vengeanc upon an ancient foe and to
still the scandal degrad me from my governorshipinto some place of
greater power and profit
oh while iren plead befor me and heedless of the presenc of jodd
even cast her arm about me and laid her head upon my breast all these
thing pass through my mind in it scale i weigh the matter out
and the beam rose against me for i knew well that if i spare iren i
condemn myself and those who were more to me than myself my wife my
children and all the northmen who clung to me and who would not see me
die without blow struck i understood it all and understand of a
sudden made up my mindto spare iren come what might i would be no
butcher i would follow my heart whithersoev it might lead me
ceas madam i said i have decid jodd bid the messeng summon
hither heliodor and martina my wife and your
oh exclaim iren if these women ar to be call in counsel on
my case all is finish see that both of them love you and ar my
enemi moreov i have some pride left to you i could plead but not
to them though thei blind me with their bodkin after thei have stab
me with their tongu excel a last boon call in your guard and
kill me
madam i said that i had decid and all the women in the world will
not chang my mind in thi wai or in that jodd do my bid
jodd struck a bell onc onli which wa the signal for the messeng
he came and receiv hi order then follow a paus sinc heliodor
and martina were in a place close by and must be sent for dure thi
time iren began to talk to me of sundri gener matter she compar
the view that might be seen from thi hous in lesbo to that from the
terrac of her palac on the bosphoru and describ it differ to
me she ask me as to the caliph harunalrashid whom she understood
i had seen inquir as to the estim i had form of hi charact
lastli with a laugh she dwelt upon the strang vicissitud of life
look at me she said i began my dai as the daughter of a greek
gentleman with no dower save my wit and beauti then i rose to be a
ruler of the world and knew all that it ha to give of pomp and power
nation trembl at my nod at my smile men grew great at my frown thei
fade into nothing save you olaf none ever realli conquer me
until i fell in the appoint hour and now of thi splendour there is
left but a nun robe of thi countless wealth but on silver crucifix
of thi powernaught
so she spoke on still not know to what decis i had come whether
she were to be blind or to live or die to myself i thought it wa a
proof of her great that she could thu turn her mind to such thing
while fate hover over her it hand upon a sword but it mai be that
she thought thu to impress me and to enmesh me in memori which would
tie my hand or even from the charact of my answer to draw some
auguri of her doom
the women came at length heliodor enter first and to her iren
bow
greet ladi of egypt she said ah had you taken my counsel in
the past that titl might have been your in veri truth and there you
and your husband could have found a new line of king independ of
the empir which totter to it fall
i rememb no such counsel madam said heliodor it seem to me
that the cours i took wa right and on pleas to god sinc it ha
given me my husband for myself although it is true wickedli rob of
hi ey
for yourself can you sai so while martina is alwai at hi side she
ask in a muse voic well it mai be for in thi world strang
thing happen
she paus and i heard both heliodor and jodd move as though in anger
for her bitter shaft had gone home then she went on softli
ladi mai i tell you that in my judgment your beauti is even greater
than it wa though it is true it ha grown from bud to flower few bear
their year and a mother burden so lightli in these hot land
heliodor did not answer for at that moment martina enter see
iren for the first time she forgot everyth that had pass and
curtsei to her in the old fashion murmur the familiar word
thy servant greet thee augusta
nai us not that titl martina to on who ha done with the world
and it vaniti call me mother if you will for that is the onli
name of honour by which those of my religi order mai be known in
truth as your mother in god i welcom you and bless you from my heart
forgiv you those ill which you have work against me be as
i know well driven by a love that is greater than ani woman bear to
woman but that eat fire of passion scorn is the heritag of both
of us and of it we will talk afterward i must not wast the time of
the gener olaf whom destini in return for mani grief ha appoint
to be my jailer oh olaf she ad with a littl laugh some
foresight of the futur must have taught me to train you for the post
let us then be silent ladi and listen to the judgment which thi
jailer of mine is about to pass upon me do you know it is no less than
whether these ey of mine which you were wont to prais martina
which in hi lighter moment even thi stern olaf wa wont to prais
should be torn from beneath my brow and if so whether it should be
done in such a fashion that i die of the deed that and no less is the
matter which hi lip must settl now speak excel
madam i said slowli to the best of my wit i have consid the
letter sent to me under the seal and sign of the emperor nicephoru
although it might be so interpret by some i cannot find in that
letter ani direct command that i should caus you to be blind but
onli on that i should keep you under strict guard give you such
thing as ar necessari to your susten thi then i shall do and by
the first ship make report of my action to the emperor at byzantium
now when she heard these word at length the proud spirit of iren
broke
god reward you for i cannot olaf she cri god reward you saint
among men who can pai back cruel injuri with the gentlest merci
so sai she burst into tear and fell senseless to the ground
martina ran to aid her but heliodor turn to me and said in her
tender voic
thi is worthi of you olaf and i would not have you do otherwis
yet husband i fear that thi piti of your ha sign the
deathwarr of us all
so it prove to be though as it chanc that warrant wa never
execut i made my report to byzantium and in cours of time the
answer came in a letter from the emperor thi letter coldli approv
of my act in set and formal phrase it ad that the truth had been
convei publicli to those slander of the emperor who announc that
he had caus iren to be first blind and then put to death in lesbo
wherebi their evil tongu had been silenc
then came thi pregnant sentenc
we command you with your wife and children and your lieuten the
captain jodd with hi wife and children to lai down your offic and
report yourselv with all speed to us at our court of byzantium that
we mai confer with you on certain matter if it is not conveni to
you or you can find no fit ship in which to sail at onc know that
within a month of your receipt of thi letter our fleet will call at
lesbo and bring you and the other herein mention to our presenc
that is a death sentenc said martina when she had finish read
out thi passag i have seen sever such sent in my dai when i wa
iren confidenti ladi it is the common form we shall never reach
byzantium olaf or if we do we shall never leav it more
i nod for i knew that thi wa so then at some whisper word from
martina heliodor spoke
husband she said forese thi issu martina jodd and most of
the northmen and i have made a plan which we now submit to you prai
that for our sake if not for your you will not thrust it asid
we have bought two good ship arm them and furnish them with all
thing need moreov dure the past two month we have sold much
of our properti turn it into gold thi is our planthat we pretend
to obei the order of the emperor but instead of head for byzantium
sail awai north to the land in which you were born where have rank
and possess you mai still becom a mighti chief if we go at onc
we shall miss the imperi fleet and i think that none will follow us
now i bow my head for a while and thought then i lift it and said
so let it be no other road is open
for my own sake i would not have stir an inch i would have gone to
the court of the emperor at byzantium and there argu out the thing in
a gambler spirit prepar to win or prepar to lose there at least
i should have had all the imageworshipp who ador iren that is
the full half of the empir upon my side and if i perish i should
perish as a saint but a wife and children ar the most terribl gift
of god if the most bless for thei turn our heart to water so for
the first time in my life i grew afraid and for their sake fled
as might be expect have martina brain heliodor love and the
northmen loyalti at the back of it our plan went well a letter wa
sent to the emperor sai that we would await the arriv of the fleet
to obei hi command have some privat matter to arrang befor we
left lesbo then on a certain even we embark on two great ship
about four hundr soul in all
befor we went i bade farewel to iren she wa seat outsid the
hous that had been given to her emploi in spin for it wa her
fanci to earn the bread she at by the labour of her hand round
her were plai jodd children and my own whom in order to escap
suspicion we had sent thither till the time came for us to embark
sinc the peopl of lesbo onli knew of our scheme by rumour
whither do you go olaf she ask
back to the north whenc i came madam i answer to save the
live of these and i wave my hand toward the children if i bide
here all must die we have been sent for to byzantium as i think you
were wont to send for offic who had ceas to pleas you
i understand olaf moreov i know it is i who have brought thi
troubl upon you becaus you spare me whom it wa meant that you
should kill also i know through friend of mine that henceforth for
reason of polici my littl end of life is safe and perhap with it my
sight all thi i ow to you though now at time i regret that i ask
the boon from the lot of an empress to that of a spinningwif is a
great chang and on which i find it heard to bear still i have my
peac to make with god and toward that peac i strive yet will you
not take me with you olaf i should like to found a nunneri in that

templ at aar that he and hi fellow god or demon would prevail
against my flesh and that of those who clung to me fulfil at last in
the fire of martyrdom for the faith as hi promis of my happi wa
fulfil
