honest john
more than thirti year ago two atom of the etern energi sped forth
from the heart of it which we call god and incarn themselv in
the human shape that were destin to hold them for a while as vase
hold perfum or goblet wine or as spark of everlast radium
inhabit the bowel of the rock perhap these two atom or essenc
or monad indestruct did but repeat an adventur or mani mani
adventur perhap again and again thei had proceed from that home
august and imperish on certain morn of the dai of time to
return thither at noon or nightfal laden with the fruit of gain
experi so at least on of them seem to tell the other befor all
wa done and that other came to believ if so over what field did
thei roam throughout the on thei who have no end could have no
begin not those of thi world onli we mai be sure it is so small
and there ar so mani other million upon million of them and such
an infinit varieti of knowledg is need to shape the soul of man
even though it remain as yet imperfect and but a shadow of what it
shall be
godfrei knight wa born the first six month later she follow her
name wa isobel blake as though to search for him or becaus whither
he went thither she must come that be her doom and hi
their circumst or rather those of their parent were veri
differ but as it chanc the hous in which thei dwelt stood
scarc three hundr yard apart
between the river blackwat and crouch in essex is a great stretch
of land flat for the most part and rather dreari which howev to
judg from what thei have left us our ancestor thought of much
import becaus of it situat it trade and the corn it grew so
it came about that thei built great hous there and rear beauti
abbei and church for the welfar of their soul amongst these not
veri far from the coast is that of monk acr still a beauti fane
though thei be but few that worship there todai the old abbei hous
adjac is now the rectori it ha been greatli alter and the
outbuild ar shut up or us as granari and so forth by
arrang with a neighbour farmer still it grei wall contain
some fine but rather unfurnish chamber reput by the vulgar to be
haunt it wa for thi reason so sai tradit that the son of the
origin grante of monk acr abbei who bought it for a small sum
from henri viii at the dissolut of the monasteri turn the abbei
hous into a rectori and went himself to dwell in anoth known as
hawk hall situat on the bank of the littl stream of that name
hawk creek it is call which find it wai to the blackwat
parson he said were better fit to deal with ghost than laymen
especi if the said laymen had dispossess the origin of the
ghost of their earthli heritag
the ancient hawk hall a timber build of the sort common in essex
as some of it premis still show ha long sinc disappear about
the begin of the victorian era a fishmerch of the name of
brown erect on it site a commodi comfort but particularli
hideou mansion of white brick where he dwelt in affluenc in the
midst of the larg estat that had onc belong to the monk an
attempt to corner her or someth of the sort brought thi
worthi or unworthi tradesman to disast and the hall wa leas to a
harwich smackown of the name of blake a shrewd person whose origin
wa humbl he had on son name john of whom he wa determin to
make a gentleman with thi view john wa sent to a good public
school and to colleg but of him noth could make a gentleman
becaus true gentil and hi natur were far apart he remain
notwithstand all hi advantag a cun and in hi wai an abl
man of busi like hi father befor him for the rest he wa big
florid and present with the bluff and hearti manner which
sometim distinguish a faux bonhomm honest john thei call
him in the neighbourhood a soubriquet which wa of servic to him in
mani wai
suddenli honest john father di leav him well off though not so
rich as he would have like to be at first he thought of leav
hawk hall and go to live at harwich where most of hi busi
interest were but rememb that the occup of it gave him a
certain stand in the counti wherea in harwich he would have been
onli a superior tradesman he gave up the idea it wa replac by
anotherto marri well
now john blake wa not an idealist nor in ani sens romant
therefor from marriag he expect littl he did not even ask that
hi wife should be goodlook know that ani aspir which he
had toward beauti could be satisfi otherwis nor did he seek monei
be well awar that he could make thi for himself what he desir
were birth and associ after a littl wait he found exactli
what he want
a certain lord lynfield from the south of england who live in london
and wa a director of mani board took a pheasantshoot in the
neighbourhood of hawk hall and with it a hous here he live more
or less dure the winter month go up to town when necessari to
attend hi board lord lynfield wa curs with sever extravag
son with whom john blake who wa a good shot soon becam friendli
also he made himself us by lend on of them a consider sum
of monei when thi came to lord lynfield ear as honest john wa
care that it should he wa disturb and offer repay though
as a matter of fact he did not know where to turn for the cash in hi
bluffest and heartiest wai blake refus to hear of such a thing
no no my lord let it stand your son will repai me on dai and if
he doesnt what will a trifl like that matter
he certainli shall repai you but all the same mr blake you have
behav veri well and i thank you much repli hi lordship
courteous
thu did john blake becom an intim of that aristocrat famili
now lord lynfield who wa a widow had on unmarri daughter she
wa an odd and timid littl person with strong religi view who
ador secretli a highchurch curat in london thi inde wa the
reason why she had been brought to essex when her infatu wa
discov by on of her marri sister who like the rest of the
famili wa extrem low ladi jane wa small in bodi and shrink
and delic in charact somewhat mouselik inde even her ey
were larg and timid as ar those of a mous in her john blake
perceiv the exact parti whom he desir for a wife
it is not necessari to follow the piti stori to it inevit end
on happili more common at that time than it is todai mr blake
plai the earnest ardent lover and on all occas proclaim hi
own unworthi at the top of hi loud voic also he hint at larg
settlement to the marri sister who put the matter befor jane veri
plainli inde in the end after a few word with her father who
point out that the provis which could be made for her wa but
small and that he would die more happili if he knew her to be
comfort settl in life with a realli trustworthi and gener man
such as mr blake had prove himself to be she gave wai and in due
cours thei were marri
in fact the tragedi wa complet sinc jane loath her husband
whose real natur she had read from the begin as much as she
ador the highchurch curat from whom in some terribl hour she
part with broken word even when he di a few year later she
continu to ador him so much that her on hope wa that she might
meet him again in the land where there is no marri or give in
marriag but all of thi she kept lock in her poor littl heart and
meanwhil did her duti by her husband with an untroubl brow though
those mouselik ey of her grew ever more piteou
he for hi part did not do hi duti by her of on side of hi
conduct she wa careless be total indiffer as to whom he
admir other she found it hard to bear the man wa by natur a
bulli on who found pleasur in oppress the helpless and who
love in the privaci of hi home to wreak the illtemp which he wa
forc to conceal abroad in compani and especi befor ani of her
peopl he treat her with the greatest defer and would even make
loud laudatori remark concern her when thei were alon there wa a
differ tale to tell particularli if she had in ani wai fail in
promot that social advanc for which he had marri her
what do you suppos i give you all those jewel and fine cloth for
to sai noth of the monei you wast in keep up the hous he
would ask brutal
jane made no answer silenc wa her onli shield but her heart burn
within her it is probabl notwithstand her somewhat exagger
idea of duti and wife obedi that she would have pluck up her
courag and left him even if she must earn her own live as a
sempstress had it not been for on circumst that circumst wa
the arriv in the world of her daughter isobel in some wai thi
event did not add to her happi if that can be ad to which doe
not exist for the reason that her husband never forgav her becaus
thi child her onli on wa not a boi nor did he lose ani
opportun of tell her thi to her face as though the matter were
on over which she had control in other howev for the first time
in her batter littl life she drank deep of the cup of joi she
love that infant and from the first it love her and her onli while
to the father it wa indiffer and at time antagonist
from the cradl isobel show herself to be an individu of charact
even as a littl girl she knew what she want and form her own
opinion quit independ of those of other moreov in a certain
wai she wa a goodlook child but of a stamp total differ from
that of either of her parent her ey were not restless and
promin like her father or dark and plaintiv like her mother
but larg grei and steadi with long curv lash in fact thei were
fine but it wa her onli beauti sinc the brow abov them wa almost
too pronounc for that of a woman the mouth wa a littl larg and
the nose somewhat irregular her hair too though long and thick wa
straight and rather lightcolour for the rest she wa wellground
and vigor with a strong full voic and as she approach matur
she develop a fine figur
when she wa not much more than ten isobel had her first troubl with
her father someth had gone wrong with on of hi ship
specul and as usual he vent it upon hi wife so cruelli did
he speak to her on a household matter for which she wa not the least
to blame that the poor woman at last rose and left the room to hide
her tear isobel howev remain behind and walk up to her
father who stood with hi back to the fire ask him why he treat
her mother thu
mind your own busi you impertin brat he answer
mummi is my busi and you area brute she exclaim clench
her littl fist he lift hi hand as though to strike her then
chang hi mind and went awai she had conquer thenceforward mr
blake wa care not to maltreat hi wife in isobel presenc he
complain to her howev of the child conduct which he said wa
due to her bring up and encourag and ladi jane in turn
scold her in her gentl fashion for her wick word
isobel listen then ask without attempt to defend herself
were not father word to you wick also mummi it wa not your
fault if jame forgot to bring round the dogcart and made him miss the
train to london ought you to be sworn at for that
no dear but you see he is my husband and husband can sai what
thei wish to their wive
then i will never have a husband at least not on like father
isobel announc with decis
there the matter end or rather it did not end sinc from that
moment isobel began to reflect much on matrimoni and other civil
institut as to which at last she form view that were not common
among girl of her gener in short she took the first step
toward radic and enter on the road of rebellion against the
exist and acknowledg
dure the gover era which follow thi scene isobel travel far
and fast along that road the ladi or rather the ladi hire by her
father for hi wife wa allow no voic in their select were of
the other known as determin disciplinarian of the first water
for on reason or anoth thei did not stai isobel though a quick and
abl child veri fond of read moreov prove unamen under
disciplin as understood by those formid femal and ow to her
possess of a curiou tenac of purpos end by wear them
down also thei did not care for the atmospher of the hous which wa
depress
on of them onc tri to strike isobel thi wa when she wa nearli
thirteen isobel repli with the schoolroom inkpot she wa an adept
at stonethrow and other athlet art it caught her instructress
fair upon her gentl bosom spoil her dress fill her mouth and
ey with ink and nearli knock her down
i shall tell your father to flog you gasp the ladi when she
recov her breath
i should advis you not said isobel and what is more she ad
after reflect if you do i shall advis him not to listen to you
then the gover thought better of it and gave notic instead to be
just to john blake he never attempt to resort to violenc against hi
daughter thi mai have been becaus he knew by instinct that it would
not be safe to do so or tend to hi own comfort or perhap it wa for
the reason that in hi wai he wa fond of her look on her with
pride not quit untouch by fear like all bulli he wa a coward at
heart and respect anyon who dare to stand up to him even although
she were but a girl and hi own daughter
after the victim of the inkpot incid depart threaten action
at law and proclaim that her pupil would come to a bad end
question aros as to isobel futur educ evid the
gover experi had broken down and wa not worth repeat
although she trembl at the idea of part with her onli joi and
consol in life ladi jane suggest that she should be sent to
school it wa fortun for her that she did so sinc as the idea
came from hi wife mr blake negativ it at onc firmli and final
a decis which she accept with an outward sigh of resign
have learn the necess of guil and inward delight inde for
it that even she thank god upon her knee
it mai be also that her father did not wish that isobel should go awai
ladi jane bore him to distract sinc kick a cushion soon
becom poor sport so much did she bore him inde that for thi and
other reason he pass most of hi time in london or at harwich in
both of which place he had offic where he transact hi ship
busi onli spend the weekend at hawk hall it wa hi custom
to bring with him parti of friend busi men as a rule to whom
for sundri purpos he wish to appear in the charact of a famili
man and local magnat isobel who wa quick and vivaci even while
she wa still a child help to make these parti pass off well
wherea without her he felt that thei would have been a failur also
she wa us dure the shoot season so it came about that she
wa kept at home
it wa at thi junctur that an idea came to mr blake a few year
befor at the veri depth of the terribl agricultur depress of
the period he had purchas at a forc sale by the mortgage the
entir monk acr estat at about 12 the acr which wa less than
the cost of the build that stood upon the land thi as he
explain to all and sundri he had done at great person loss in the
interest of the tenant and labour but as a matter of fact even at
the exist rent the invest paid him a fair rate of interest
and wa on which as a busi man he knew must increas in valu
when time chang with the properti went the advowson of monk acr
and it chanc that a year later the live fell vacant through the
resign of the incumb mr blake now as alwai seek
popular consult the bishop consult the churchwarden
consult the parishion and in the end consult hi own interest
by nomin the nephew of a wealthi baronet of hi acquaint whom
he wa anxiou to secur as a director upon the board of a certain
compani in which he had larg hold
i have never seen thi cleric gentleman and know noth of hi
view or anyth about him but if you recommend him my dear sir
samuel it is enough for me sinc i alwai judg of a man by hi
friend perhap you will furnish me or rather my lawyer with the
necessari particular and i will see that the matter is put through
now to come to more import busi as to thi board of which i am
chairman c
the end of it wa that sir samuel flatter by such defer becam
a member of the board and sir samuel nephew becam rector of monk
acr
such appoint like marriag ar made in heavenat least that
seem to be the doctrin of the english church which is content to act
thereon in thi particular instanc the result were quit good the
rev mr knight the nephew of the opul sir samuel prove to be an
excel and hardwork clergyman he wa lowchurch and narrow
almost to the point of calvin but intens earnest and
conscienti on who look upon the world as a place of sin and woe
through which we must labour and pass on a difficult path beset with
rock and thorn lead to the unmeasur plain of heaven also he
wa an educ man who had taken high degre at colleg and realli
learn in hi wai while he wa a curat work veri hard in a great
seaport town he had marri the daughter of anoth clergyman of the
citi who di in a sudden fashion as the result of an accid
leav the girl an orphan she wa not pure english as her mother had
been a dane but on both side her descent wa high as inde wa that
of mr knight himself
thi union contract on the husband part larg from motiv that
might be call charit sinc he had promis hi deceas
colleagu on hi death bed to befriend the daughter wa but moder
success the wife had the characterist of her race larg and
liber of view high aspir for human consider
intellig and a certain tendenc toward mystic of the
swedenborgian type qualiti that her husband neither share nor could
appreci it wa perhap as well therefor that she di at the
birth of her onli son godfrei three year after her marriag
mr knight never marri again matrimoni wa not a state which
appeal to hi somewhat shrunken natur although he admit it
necess to the human race of it in hi heart he did not approv nor
would he ever have undertaken it at all had it not been for a sens of
oblig thi attitud becaus it made for virtu as he understood
it he set down to virtu as we ar all apt to do a sacrific of the
thing of earth and of the flesh to the thing of heaven and of the
spirit in fact it wa noth of the sort but onli the outcom of
individu physic and mental condit toward femal societi
howev hallow and approv it form he had no lean also the
child wa a difficulti so great inde that at time almost he
regret that a wise provid had not thought fit to take it
straight to the joi of heaven with it mother though afterward as
the boi intellig unfold he develop interest in him thi
howev he wa care to keep in check lest he should fall into the
sin of inordin affect denounc by st paul in common with other
error
final he found an elderli widow name parson who act as hi
housekeep and took charg of hi son fortun for godfrei her
sens of parenthood wa more pronounc than that of hi father and
she who had lost two children of her own plai the part of mother to
him with a warm and loyal heart from the first she love him and he
love her it wa an affect that continu throughout their live
when godfrei wa about nine hi father health broke down he wa
still a curat in hi seaport town for good as good is
understood and hardwork as he wa no promot had come hi wai
perhap thi wa becaus the bishop and hi other superior
recognis hi lack of sympathi and hi narrow of outlook did not
think him a suitabl man to put in charg of a parish at ani rate so
it happen
thu aros hi appeal to hi wealthi and power rel sir samuel
and hi final nomin to a countri benefic for in the countri the
doctor said that he must liveunless he wish to die convinc
though he wa of the enorm advantag of heaven over an earth which
he knew to be extrem sin the rev mr knight like the rest of
the world shrank from the second altern which as he state in a
letter of thank to sir samuel howev much it might benefit him
person would cut short hi period of terrestri us to
other so he accept the rectorship of monk acr with gratitud
in on wai there wa not much for which to be grate see that in
those dai of depreci tith the live wa not worth more than
250 a year and hi own resourc which came from hi wife small
fortun were veri limit it should have been valuabl but the great
tith were alien with the land properti of the abbei by henri
viii and now belong to the lai rector mr blake who show no
sign of us them to increas the incumb stipend
still there wa a good hous with an excel garden too good inde
with it beauti and ancient room which a former rector of
archolog knowledg and mean had in part restor to their
pristin state while for the rest hi tast were simpl and hi need
few for of cours he neither drank wine nor smoke therefor as
ha been said he took the live with thank and determin to
make the best of it on a total incom of about 350 a year
chapter ii
isobel kiss godfrei
on the whole monk acr suit mr knight fairli well it is true that
he did not like the abbei as it wa still call of which the
associ and architectur beauti made no appeal to him and
thought often with affect of the lodginghouselik abod in which
he had dwelt in hi southern seaport town amid the victorian
surround that were suit to hi victorian natur the gloriou
church too irrit him partli becaus it wa so gloriou and
notwithstand all that the reform had done to mar it so
suggest of papist practic and error and partli becaus the
congreg wa so scanti in that great expans of nave and aisl to
sai noth of the chancel and sundri chapel that thei look like a
few wander sheep left by themselv in a vast and almost empti
fold nor wa thi strang see that the total popul of the
parish wa but on hundr and fortyseven soul
of hi squir and patron he saw but littl occasion mr blake
attend church and as layrector wa accommod in an ugli oak box
in the chancel where hi big bodi and florid counten remind
godfrei of farmer johnson prize poll ox in it stall these state
visit were not howev veri frequent and depend larg upon the
guest who were stai for the weekend at the hall if mr blake
discov that these gentlemen were religi inclin he went to
church if otherwis and thi wa more common act on hi principl
of be all thing to all men he stop awai
person he did not bother hi head about the matter which in
secret he look upon as on of the ramif of the great edific
of british cant the vast major of peopl in hi view went to
church not becaus thei believ in anyth or wish for instruct
or spiritu consol but becaus it look respect which wa
exactli why he did so himself even then nearli alwai he sat alon in
the oak box hi visitor gener prefer to occupi the pew in the
nave which wa frequent by ladi jane and isobel
nor did the two often meet social sinc their natur were
antipathet in the bosom of hi famili mr blake would refer to mr
knight as the littl parson rat while in hi bosom mr knight would
think of mr blake as that bull of bashan further after some
troubl had arisen about a question of tith also about the upkeep of
the chancel blake discov that beneath hi meek exterior the
clergyman had a strong will and veri clear idea of the differ
between right and wrong in short that he wa not a man to be trifl
with and less still on of whom he could make a tool have
ascertain these thing he left him alon as much as possibl
mr knight veri soon becam awar first that hi incom wa
insuffici to hi need and secondli especi now when hi health
wa much improv that after a busi and hardwork life time at
monk acr hung heavili upon hi hand the latter troubl to some
extent he palliat by begin the great work that he had plan
ever sinc he becam a deacon for which hi undoubt scholarship gave
him certain qualif it provision titl wa babylon
unveil he would have like to substitut the scarlet woman for
babylon and it appar object an elabor attack upon the roman
church which in fact wa but a cover for the real onslaught with the
roman although perhap he did not know it himself he had certain
sympathi for instanc in the matter of celibaci nor did he
entir disapprov of the monast order then he found noth
shock in the tenet and method of the jesuit work for what thei
conceiv to be a good end the real target of hi animos were hi
highchurch brethren of the church of england wretch who whilst
retain all the privileg of the anglican establish such as
marriag did not hesit to adopt almost everi error of rome and to
make us of her secret power over the soul of men by the practic of
confess and otherwis
as thi monument treatis began in the time of the earli father and
wa plan to fill ten volum of at least a hundr thousand word
apiec no on will be surpris to learn that it never reach the
stage of public or inde to be accur that it came to final
stop somewher about the time of athanasiu
realiz that the work wa like to equal that of gibbon both in
length and the year necessari to it complet also that from it
could be expect no immedi pecuniari profit mr knight look
round to find some other wai of occupi hi leisur and ad to
hi incom although a reserv person on a certain sundai when he
went to lunch at the hall in the absenc of mr blake who wa spend
the weekend somewher els he confid hi difficulti to ladi jane
whom he felt to be sympathet
the hous is so big he complain mr parson godfrei old
nurs and hi housekeep and on girl cannot even keep it clean it
wa most foolish of my predecessor in the live to restor that old
refectori and all the southern dormitori upon which i am told he
spent no less than 1500 of hi own monei never reflect on the
expens which hi successor must incur mere to keep them in order
sinc be onc there thei ar liabl for charg for dilapid
it would have been better after permiss obtain to let them go to
ruin
no doubt but thei ar veri beauti ar thei not remark ladi
jane feebli
beauti is a luxuri and i mai add a snare it is a mistaken love of
beauti and pomp bait that the evil on well know how to us which
have led so larg a section of our church astrai he repli sip
at hi tumbler of water
a silenc follow for ladi jane who from earli and tender
associ love highchurch practic did not know what to answer
it wa broken by isobel who had been listen to the convers in
her acut wai and now said in her clear strong voic
why dont you keep a school mr knight there lot of room for it
in the abbei
a school he said a school i never thought of that no it is
ridicul still pupil perhap out of the mouth of babe and
suckl c well it is time for me to be go i will think the
matter over after church
mr knight did think the matter over and after consult with hi
housekeep mr parson an advertis appear in the time and
the spectat invit parent and guardian to entrust two or three
lad to the advertis care to receiv preliminari educ
togeth with hi own son it prove fruit and after an exchang of
the highest refer two littl boi appear at monk acr both
of them rather delic in health thi wa shortli befor the crisi
aros as to the futur teach of isobel when the last gover
wish her a better spirit had bidden her a frigid farewel and
shaken the dust of hawk hall off her feet
on dai isobel wa sent with a note to the abbei hous she rang the
bell but no on came for mr knight wa out walk with hi pupil
and mr parson and the parlourmaid were elsewher tire of wait
she wander round the grei old build in the hope of find someon
to whom she could deliv the letter and came to the refectori which
had a separ entranc the door wa open and she peep in at first
after the brilliant sunlight without she saw noth except the great
empti of the place with it splendid oak roof on the repair of
which the late incumb had spent so much sinc as is common in
monkish build the window were high and narrow present
howev she perceiv a littl figur seat in the shadow at the end
of the long oaken refectori tabl that at which the monk had eaten
which still remain where it had stood for hundr of year on of
the fixtur of the hous and knew it for that of godfrei mr
knight son glide toward him quietli she saw that he wa asleep
and stop to studi him
he wa a beauti boi pale just now for he had recov but recent
from some childish ill hi hair wa dark and curl dark too
were hi ey though these she could not see and the lash over
them while hi hand were long and fine he look most lone and
pathet there in the big oak chair that had so often accommod the
portli form of depart abbot and her warm heart went out toward
him of cours isobel knew him but not veri well for he wa a shy lad
and her father had never encourag intimaci between the abbei hous
and the hall
somehow she had the idea that he wa unhappi for inde he look so
even in hi sleep though perhap thi wa to be account for by a
paper of unfinish sum befor him sympathi well up in isobel who
rememb the oppress of the last governessh of the inkpot
sympathi ye and more than sympathi for of a sudden she felt as she
had never felt befor she love the littl lad as though he were her
brother a strang affin for him came home to her although she did
not defin it thu it wa as if she knew that her spirit wa intim
with hi ye and alwai had been and alwai would be intim
thi subtl knowledg went through isobel like fire and shook her she
turn pale her nostril expand her larg ey open and she
sigh she did more inde drawn by some overmast impuls she
drew near to godfrei and kiss him gentli on the forehead then glide
back again frighten and asham at her own act
now he woke up she felt hi dark ey look at her then he spoke in
a slow puzzl voic sai
i have had such a funni dream i dream that a spirit came and kiss
me i did not see it but i think it must have been my mother
why ask isobel
becaus no on els ever care enough for me to kiss me except mr
parson and she ha given it up now that the other boi ar here
doe not your father kiss you she ask
ye onc a week on sundai even when i go to bed becaus i dont
count that
no i understand said isobel think of her own father then ad
hastili it must be sad not to have a mother
it is he answer especi when on is ill as i have been and
must lie so long in bed with pain in the head you know i had an
abscess in the ear and it hurt veri much
i didnt know we heard you were ill and mother want to come to see
you father wouldnt let her he thought it might be measl and he is
afraid of catch thing
ye repli godfrei without surpris it wasnt measl but if it
had been you might have caught them so of cours he wa right to be
care
oh he wasnt think of me or mummi he wa think of himself
blurt out isobel with the candour of youth
big strong men dont catch measl said godfrei in mild
astonish
he sai thei do and that thei ar veri danger when you ar grown
up why ar you alon here and what ar you work at
my father ha kept me in as a punish becaus i did my sum wrong
the other boi have gone out birdnest but i have to stop here
until i get them right i dont know when that will be he ad with
a sigh as i hate rule of three and cant do it
rule of three said isobel im quit good at it you see i like
figur my father sai it is the famili busi instinct here let
me try move to the other side of that big chair there plenti of
room for two and show it to me
he obei with alacr and soon the brown head and the fair on were
bent togeth over the scrawl sheet isobel who had realli a bud
talent for mathemat work out the sum or rather the sum without
difficulti and then with guil acquir under the gover rgime
made him copi them and destroi all trace of her own handiwork
ar you as stupid at everyth as you ar at sum she ask when he
had finish rise from the chair and seat herself on the edg of
the tabl
what a rude thing to ask of cours not he repli indignantli i
am veri good at latin and histori which i like but you see father
doesnt care much for them he wa a wrangler you know
a wrangler how dread i suppos that is why he argu so much in
hi sermon i hate histori it full of date and the name of king
who were all bad i cant make out why peopl put up with king she
ad reflect
becaus thei ought to god bless our graciou queen you know
well god mai bless her but i dont see why i should as she never did
anyth for me though father doe hope she will make him someth
on dai id like to be a republican with a presid as thei have in
america
you must be what father call a wick radic said godfrei stare
at her on of those peopl who want to disestablish the church
i daresai she repli nod her head that is if you mean make
clergymen work like other peopl instead of spy and gossip and
plai game as thei do about here
godfrei did not pursu the argument but remark immor
it a piti you dont come to our class for then i could do your
histori paper and you could do my sum
she start but all she said wa
thi would be a good place to learn histori now i must be go
dont forget to give the note i shall have to sai that i wait a long
while befor i found anyon goodby godfrei
goodby isobel he answer but she wa gone
i hope he did dream that it wa hi mother who kiss him isobel
reflect to herself for now the full enorm of her perform came
home to her young as she wa a mere child with no knowledg of the
great anim forc of life and of the mysteri behind them she
wonder why she had done thi thing what it wa that forc her to do
it for she knew well that someth had forc her someth outsid
of herself as she understood herself it wa as though anoth entiti
that wa in her and yet not herself had taken possess of her and
made her act as uninfluenc she never would have act thu she
ponder in her calm fashion then be abl to make noth of the
busi shrug her shoulder and let it go by after all it
matter noth sinc godfrei had dream that the ghost of hi mother
had visit him and would not suspect her of be that ghost and she
wa certain that never would she do such a thing again the troubl wa
that she had done it onc and that the deed signifi some chang in
her which her childish mind could not understand
on reach the hall or rather shortli afterward she saw her father
who wa wait for the carriag in which to go to the station to meet
some particularli import weekend guest he ask if she had brought
ani answer to hi note to mr knight and she told him that she had
left it in the schoolroom as she call the refectori becaus he wa
out
i hope he will get it grumbl mr blake on of my friend who is
come down tonight think he understand architectur and i want the
parson to show him over the abbei hous inde that why he ha come
for you see he is an american who think a lot of such old thing
well it is beauti isnt it father she said even i felt that
it would be easi to learn in that big old room with a roof like that of
a church
an idea struck him
would you like to go to school there isobel
i think so father as i must go to school somewher and i hate those
horribl gover
well he repli you couldnt throw inkpot at the holi knight as
you did at miss hook lord what a rage she wa in he ad with a
chuckl i had to pai her 5 for a new dress but it wa better to do
that than to risk a counti court action
then the carriag came and he depart
the upshot of it all wa that isobel becam anoth of mr knight
pupil when mr blake suggest the arrang to hi wife she
rais certain object among them that associ with these
littl lad might make a tomboi of the girl ad that she had been
taught with children of her own sex he retort in hi rough marit
fashion that if it made someth differ of isobel to what she the
mother wa he would be glad inde as usual ladi jane opposit
settl the matter
now for the next few year of isobel life there is littl to be told
mr knight wa an abl man and a good teacher and be a clever girl
she learn a great deal from him especi in the wai of
mathemat for which as ha been said she had a natur lean
inde veri soon she outstrip godfrei and the other lad in thi and
sundri other branch of studi sit at a tabl by herself on what
onc had been the dai of the old hall in the interv of lesson
howev it wa their custom to take walk togeth and then it wa
that she alwai found herself at the side of godfrei inde thei
becam insepar at ani rate in mind a strang and most uncommon
intimaci exist between these young creatur almost might it have
been call a friendship of the spirit yet and thi wa the curiou
part of it thei were dissimilar in almost everyth that goe to make
up a human be even in childhood there wa scarc a subject on
which thei thought alik scarc a point upon which thei would not
argu
godfrei wa fond of poetri it bore isobel hi tendenc were
toward religion though of a veri differ type from that preach and
practis by hi father her were antireligi in fact she would
have been inclin to endors the sai of that other schoolgirl who
defin faith as the art of believ those thing which we know to be
untru while to him on the other hand thei were profoundli true
though often enough not in the wai that thei ar gener accept
had he possess ani power of definit at that ag probabl he
would have describ our accept belief as shadow of the truth
distort and fantast shape like those thrown by chang
rag cloud behind which the etern sun is shine shadow that
vari in length and charact accord to the hour and weather of the
mortal dai
isobel for her part took littl heed of shadow her clear scientif
stamp of mind search for ascertain fact and on these she built
up her philosophi of life and of the death that end it of cours all
such contradict mai often be found in a singl mind which believ
at on time and reject at anoth and see two or twenti side of
everyth with a pain and bewild clear
such a charact is apt to end in profound dissatisfact with the
self from which it cannot be free much more then would on have
imagin that these two must have been dissatisfi with each other and
sought the opportun of escap which were open to them but it wa
not so in the least thei argu and contradict until thei had
noth more to sai and then laps into long period of weari but
goodnatur silenc in a sens each complet each by the addit of
it opposit as the dark complet the light thu make the
round of the perfect dai
as yet thi deep affect and remark on show no sign of
the end to which obvious it wa drift that kiss which the girl
had given to the boi wa pure sisterli or on might almost sai
motherli and inde thi qualiti inspir their relationship for much
longer than might have been expect so much wa thi so that no on
connect with them on either side ever had the slightest suspicion
that thei care for each other in ani wai except as friend and fellow
pupil
so the year went by till the pair were seventeen young man and young
woman though still call boi and girl thei were goodlook in
their respect wai though yet unform tall and straight too both
of them but singularli dissimilar in appear as well as in mind
godfrei wa dark pale and thoughtfulfac isobel wa fair
vivaci opennatur amus and given to sai the first thing
that came to her tongu she had few reserv her thought might
be read in her larg grei ey befor thei were heard from her lip
which gener wa not long afterward also she wa veri abl she
read and understood the paper and follow all the movement of the
dai with a live interest especi if these had to do with nation
affair or with women and their statu
busi too came natur to her so much so that her father would
consult her about hi undertak that is about those of them which
were absolut abov board and beyond suspicion of sharp deal the
other he wa far too wise to bring within her ken know exactli
what he would have heard from her upon the subject and yet
notwithstand all hi care she suspect him by instinct not by
knowledg for hi part he wa proud of her and would listen with
pleasur when still a mere child she engag hi guest boldli in
argument for instanc a bishop or a dean on theologi or a statesman
on current polit alreadi he had form great plan for her futur
she wa to marri a peer who took an activ part in thing or at ani
rate a lead politician and to becom a power in the land but of
thi too wise he said noth to isobel for the time had not yet
come
dure these year thing had prosper exceedingli with john blake who
wa now a veri rich man with ship own or partli own by him on
everi sea on sever occas he had been ask to stand for
parliament and declin the honour he knew himself to be no speaker
and wa sure also that he could not attend both to the affair of the
countri and to those of hi everspread busi so he took anoth
cours and began to support the conserv parti which he select
as the safest by mean of larg subscript
he did more he bought a baronetci for onli thu can the transact
be describ when a gener elect wa draw near on even
after dinner at hawk hall he had a pure busi convers with
a polit whip who perhap not without motiv had been complain
to him of the deplet state of the parti chest
well said mr blake you know that my principl ar your and that
i should like to help your or rather our caus monei is tight with me
just now and the outlook is veri bad in my trade but im a man who
alwai back hi fanci in short would 15000 be of us
the whip intim that it would be of the greatest us
of cours continu mr blake i presum that the usual
acknowledg would follow
what acknowledg ask the whip sip hi port wearili for
such negoti were no new thing to him i mean how do you spell
it
with a p said mr blake boldli act on hi usual principl of
ask for more than he hope to get
the whip contempl him through hi eyeglass with a mild and
interest stare
out of the question my dear fellow he said that box is full and
lock and there a long outsid list wait as well perhap you
mean with a k you know monei isnt everyth as some of you
gentlemen seem to think and if it were you would have said fifti
instead of fifteen
k be damn repli mr blake im not a mayor or an actormanag
let sai b that stand for begin as well as baronet also it
come befor p doesnt it
well let see you havent a son have you then perhap it might be
manag repli the whip with gentl but point insol for mr
blake annoi him ill make inquiri and now shall we join the
ladi i want to continu my convers with your daughter about the
corrupt which some enemi take advantag of her innoc ha
persuad her exist in the conserv parti she is a clever young
ladi and make out a good case against us though i am sure i do not
know whenc she got her inform not from you i suppos sir
johni beg your pardon mr blake
so the matter wa settl as both of them knew it would be when thei
left the room the cash found it wai into some nebul account that
nobodi could have identifi with ani parti and in the dissolut
honour john blake esq jp wa transform into sir john blake
bart inform that left ten of thousand of the student of the
list mildli marvel why as the same wonder struck them regard
the vast major of the name which appear therein thi howev
did not matter thei presum good easi soul that john blake esq
jp and the rest were patriot who for long year had been work
for the good of their countri and that what thei had done in secret
had been discov in high place and wa now proclaim from the
housetop
ladi jane wa inclin to share thi view she knew that a great deal
of her husband monei went into mysteri channel of which she wa
unabl to trace the end and conclud in her victorianwif kind of
fashion or at ani rate hope that it wa spent in allevi the
distress of the submerg tenth which at that time wa much in
evid henc no doubt the graciou recognit that had come to him
john blake himself who paid over the cash natur had no such
delus and unfortun in that moment of exult when he
contempl hi own name adorn the list in everi newspap let
out the truth at breakfast at which isobel wa hi sole companion for
by thi time ladi jane had grown too delic to come down earli
well youv got a baronet for a father now my girlto be accur
he call it a barth said puf himself out like a great toad
befor the fire as he threw down the daili new in which hi name
wa icili ignor in a spite leaderett about the honour list upon
the top of the time the standard and the morn post
oh said isobel in an interest voic and paus
it wonder what monei can do went on her father who wa
inclin for a discuss and saw no other wai of open up the
subject certain qualif of which it doe not becom me to
speak and a good subscript to the parti fund and there you ar
with bart instead of esq after your name and sir befor it i wonder
when i shall get the patent you know baronet do not receiv the
accolad
dont thei comment isobel well that save the queen some
troubl of which she must be glad as she doe not get the subscript
i know all about the accolad she ad for godfrei ha told me
onli the other dai he wa show me in the abbei church where the
warrior who were to receiv it knelt all night befor the altar but
thei didnt give subscript thei prai and afterward took a cold
bath
time ar chang he answer
ye of cours i cant see you kneel all night with a white robe
on father in prayer befor an altar but tell me would thei have
made you a baronet if you hadnt given the subscript
sir john chuckl till hi great form shookh had grown veri stout of
late year
i think you ar sharp enough to answer that question for yourself i
have observ isobel that you know as much of the world as most young
girl of your ag
so you bought the thing she exclaim with a flash of her grei ey
i thought that honour were given becaus thei were earn
did you said sir john chuckl again well now you know better
look here isobel dont be a fool honour or most of them like
other thing ar for those who can pai for them in thi wai or that
nobodi bother how thei come so long as thei do come now listen
unfortun as a girl you cant inherit thi titl but it doesnt
matter much sinc it will be easi for you to get on for yourself
isobel turn red and utter an exclam but enjoin silenc on
her with a wave of hi fat hand her father went on
i havent done so badli my dear consid my chanc i dont mind
tell you that i am a rich man now inde a veri rich man as thing
go and i shall be much richer for noth pai like ship especi
if you man them with foreign crew also i am a bart and he point
to the pile of newspap on the floor and if my parti get in again
befor long i shall be a lord which would make you an honour
anywai my girl although you aint exactli a beauti here he
consid her with a critic ey youll make a fine figur of a
woman and with your monei you should be abl to get ani husband you
like what more and he bang hi fist upon the tabl i expect
you to do it that your part of the famili busi do you
understand
i understand father that you expect me to get ani husband i like

sir john with sarcasm but dont you try it on me for im smarter

then look him straight in the ey she turn and left the room
an odd child thought sir john to himself as he stare after her
anywai she ha got spirit and no doubt will come all right in time
when she learn what what
chapter iii
the plantagenet ladi
in the cours of these year of adolesc godfrei knight had
develop into a rather unusu stamp of youth in some wai he wa
clever for instanc at the classic and histori which he had alwai
like in other and especi where figur were concern he wa
stupid or as hi father call him idl in compani he wa apt to be
shy and dull unless some subject interest him when to the
astonish of those present he would hold forth and show knowledg
and power of reflect beyond hi year by natur he wa intens
proud the on thing he never forgot wa a rebuff or forgav wa an
insult sir john blake soon found thi out and not like the lad
whose charact wa antagonist to hi own in everi wai never lost an
opportun of what he call put him in hi place perhap
becaus someth warn him that thi awkward handsom boi would
becom a stumblingblock to hi success feet
godfrei and isobel were both great reader nor did thei lack for
book for as it chanc there wa a good librari at hawk hall which
had been form by the previou owner and taken over like the pictur
when mr blake bought the hous also it wa ad to constantli as an
order wa given to a larg london booksel to suppli all the
import new work that came out although he never open a book
himself sir john like to appear intellectu by displai them about
the room for the benefit of hi visitor these public isobel
read and lent to godfrei inde thei perus a great deal which young
peopl gener ar suppos to leav alon and thi in variou
school of thought includ those that ar known as free
it wa seldom that such studi led to unanim between them but to
argument which sharpen their intellect thei did lead follow
invari by a charit agreement to differ
about the time of the addit of the name of john blake to the roll of
british chivalri a book on mar came their wayit wa on by a
specul astronom which suggest that the red planet is the home
of reason be akin to human isobel read it and wa not
impress inde in the vigor languag of youth she opin that
it wa all madeup rot
godfrei read it also and came to quit a differ conclus the idea
fire him and open a wide door in hi imagin a qualiti with
which he wa well provid he stare at mar through the larg hall
telescop and saw or imagin that he saw the canal also the
snowcap and the red herbag isobel stare too and saw or swore that
she sawnoth at allaft which thei argu until their throat
were dry
it all nonsens said isobel if onli youll studi the rock and
biologi and darwin origin of speci and lot of other thing
you will see how man came to develop on thi planet he is just an
accid of natur that all
and why shouldnt there be an accid of natur on mar and
elsewher queri godfrei
perhap but if so it is quit anoth accid and ha noth to do
with us
i dont know he answer sometim here hi voic becam dreami
as it had a wai of do i think that we pass on all of us from
star to star at least i know i often feel as if i had done so
you mean from planet to planet godfrei star ar hot place you
know you should not swallow all that theosoph bosh which is base
on noth
there the bibl went on godfrei which tell us the same thing
that we live etern
then we must alwai have live sinc etern is a circl
why not isobel that is what i wa try to sai well if we live
etern we must live somewher perhap in those planet or other
which it would be a wast to keep empti
i daresaythough natur doe not mind wast or what seem to be
wast but why should you think of live etern at all mani peopl
live a great deal too long as it is and it is horribl to believ that
thei go on for ever
you see thei might grow to someth splendid in the end isobel you
must not judg them by what thei ar now
oh i know the caterpillar and the butterfli and all the rest of it
the biblecontinu godfrei imperturbablywhen she cut him short
well what of the bibl how do you know that it is true
becaus i do know it though the truth in it mai be differ for
everyon what is more i know that on dai you will agre with me
she look at him curious in the flash wai that wa peculiar to
her for someth in hi tone and manner impress her
perhap i hope so godfrei but at present i often feel as though i
believ in noth except that i am i and you ar you and my father
isther he call me goodby and she wa gone
thi particular convers on of mani had as it happen
import result on the live of these two young creatur isobel in
whom the love of truth howev ugli it might be and howev
destruct of hope faith chariti and all the virtu wa a burn
inbr passion took to the secret studi of theologi in order to find
out why godfrei wa so convinc as to the teach of the bibl she
wa not old or mellow enough to understand that the real reason must
be discov not in the letter but in the spirit that is in the
esoter mean of the sai as to receiv the kingdom of heaven
like a child and the necess of be born again therefor with a
fierc intens thrust asid the spirit and it prompt which
perhap ar shadow of the onli real truth she wrestl with the
letter she read the divin also much of the higher critic the
live of saint the sacr book themselv and mani other thing
onli to aris bewild and to a great extent unbeliev
why should i believ what i cannot prove she cri in her heart and
onc with her lip to godfrei
he made her a veri wise answer although at the moment it did not
strike either of them in that light
when you tell me of anyth that you can realli prove i will show
you why he said to thi he ad a suggest that wa most unwis
name that she should consult hi father
now mr knight wa it is true a skill theologian of a certain
narrow school and learn in hi wai it is probabl howev that in
all the wide world it would have been difficult to find ani man less
sympathet to a mind like isobel or more like to antagon her
eager and bud intellig everi doubt he met with intoler
denial everi argument with offens contradict everi queri with
refer to text
final he lost hi temper for be it acknowledg that thi girl wa
persist far from humbl and in a wai as dogmat as himself he
told her that she wa not a christian and in her wrath she agre with
him he said that she had no right to be in church she repli that if
thi were so she would not come and her father be indiffer upon
the point ladi jane did not count in such matter ceas her
attend it wa the old stori of a straitmind bigot forc a
largemind doubter out of the fold that ought to have been wide
enough for both of them moreov thi differ of opinion on
matter of public and spiritu interest end in a privat and mundan
animos mr knight could never forgiv a pupil of hi own whose
abil he recogn who dare to question hi pontif
announc to him the matter wa person rather than on of
religi truth for there ar certain mind in whose crucibl
everyth is resolv individu and hi wa on of them he wa
the largest matter through hi own special and highlymagnifi
spectacl so to be brief thei quarrel onc and for all and
thenceforward never attempt to conceal their cordial dislik of each
other
such wa on result of thi unlucki discuss as to the exact
condit of the planet mar god of war anoth wa that godfrei
develop a strong interest in the studi of the heavenli bodi and
when some domest debat aros as to hi futur career announc with
mild firm that he intend to be an astronom hi father to whom
the heavenli bodi were less than the dust beneath hi human feet and
who believ in hi heart that thei had been creat everi on of
them to give a certain amount of light to the inhabit of thi
world when there wa no moon wa furiou in hi arctic fashion
especi as he wa awar that with a few distinguish except
these host of heaven did not reward their votari with either wealth
or honour
i intend you for my own profess the church he said bluntli if
you choos to stargaz in the interv of your religi duti it
is no affair of mine but pleas understand godfrei that either you
enter the church or i wash my hand of you in that event you mai seek
your live in ani wai you like
godfrei remonstr meekli to the effect that he had not made up hi
mind as to hi fit for holi order or hi wish to undertak them
you mean repli hi father that you have been infect by that
pernici girl isobel well at ani rate i will remov you from her
evil influenc i am glad to sai that ow to the fact that my littl
school here ha prosper i am in a posit to do thi i will send
you for a year to a worthi swiss pastor whom i met as a deleg to the
recent evangel congress to learn french he told me he desir an
english pupil to be instruct in that tongu and gener knowledg i
will write to him at onc i hope that in new surround you will
forget all these wild idea and after your cours at colleg settl
down to be a good and us man in the walk of life to which you ar
so clearli call
godfrei who on such occas knew how to be silent made no answer
although the attack upon isobel provok him sore in hi heart
inde he reflect that a year separ from hi parent would not
be difficult to bear especi beneath the shadow of the swiss
mountain which secretli he long to climb also he realli wish to
acquir french be a lad with some desir for knowledg and
appreci of it advantag so he look humbl mere and took the
first opportun to slip from the presenc of the fierc littl man
with small ey straight sandi hair and a slit where hi lip should
be through whose agenc although it wa hard to believ it he had
appear in thi disagre and yet most interest world
in point of fact he had an assign of an innoc sort of cours
it wa with the pernici isobel and the place appoint wa the
beauti old abbei church here thei knew that thei would be
undisturb as mr knight wa to sleep at a counti town twenti mile
awai where on the follow morn he had busi as the examin of
a local grammar school and must leav at onc to catch hi train so
when watch from an upper window he had seen the gig well on the
road godfrei depart to hi tryst
arriv in the dim and beauteou old fane the first thing he saw wa
isobel stand alon in the chancel right in the heart of a shaft of
light that fell on her through the richcolour glass of the great
west window for now it wa late in the afternoon she wore a veri
unusu white garment that becam her well but had no hat on her head
perhap thi wa becaus she had taken the fanci to do her plenti
fair hair in the old plantagenet fashion that is in two horn which
with much ingenu she had copi more or less correctli from the
brass of an ancient nobl ladi whereof the two intend to take an
impress also she had imit some of the other peculiar of
that picturesqu costum includ the long hang sleev in
short she wore a fanci dress which she propos to us afterward at a
danc and on of the object of the rub thei were about to make
wa that she might studi the detail more carefulli at least that wa
her object godfrei wa to obtain an impress of the crab
inscript at the foot of the effigi
there she stood tall and impos her arm fold on her young
breast the paint light strike full on her broad intellectu
forehead and larg grei ey shine too in a patch of crimson abov
her heart lost in thought and perfectli still she look strang
thu almost unearthli so much so that the impression and
imagin godfrei see her suddenli from the shadow halt
startl and almost frighten
what did she resembl what might she not be he queri to himself
hi quick mind suggest an answer the ghost of some ladi dead ag
sinc kill for there wa the patch of blood upon her bosom
stand abov the tomb wherein her bone crumbl and dream of
someon from whom she had been divorc by doom and violenc
he sicken a littl at the thought some dread fell upon him like a
shadow of fate uplift and point finger stop hi breath and
caus hi knee to loosen in a moment it wa gone to be replac by
anoth that wa nearer and more natur he wa to be sent awai for a
year and thi meant that he would not see isobel for a year it would
be a veri long year in which he did not see isobel he had forgotten
that when hi father told him that he wa to go to switzerland now the
fact wa painfulli present
he came on up the long nave and isobel awaken saw him
you ar late she said in a softer voic than wa usual to her
well i dont mind for i have been dream i think i went to sleep
upon my feet i dream she ad point to the brass that i wa
that ladi andoh all sort of thing well she had her dai no doubt
and i mean to have mine befor i am as dead and forgotten as she is
onli i would like to be buri here ill be cremat and have my ash
put under that stone thei wont hurt her
dont talk like that he said with a littl shiver for her word
jar upon him
why not it is as well to face thing look at all these monument
about us and inscript a lot of them to young peopl though now
it doesnt matter if thei were old or young gone everi on of them
and quit forgotten though some were great folk in their time gone
utterli and for alwai noth left except perhap descend in a
labour cottag here and there who never even heard of them
i dont believ it he said almost passion i believ that thei
ar live for ever and ever perhap as you and i perhap elsewher
i wish i could she answer smile for then my dream might have
been true and you might have been that knight whose brass is lost
and she point to an empti matrix alongsid that of the great
plantagenet ladi
godfrei glanc at the inscript which wa left when the cromwellian
tore up the brass
he wa her husband he said translat who di on the field of
creci in 1346
oh exclaim isobel and wa silent
meanwhil godfrei quit undisturb wa spell out the inscript
beneath the figur of the knight wife and remark present
she seem to have di a year befor him ye just after marriag
the monkish latin sai andwhat is it oh i see in sanguin
that is in blood whatev that mai mean perhap she wa murder i
sai isobel i wish you would copi someon els dress for your parti
nonsens she answer i think it awfulli interest i wonder
what happen to her
i dont know i cant rememb anyth in the old histori and it
would be almost imposs to find out there ar no coat of arm and
what is more no surnam is given in either inscript the on sai
prai for the soul of edmundu knight husband of phillippa and the
other prai for the soul of phillippa dame wife of edmundu it

morn to catch the earli train
chapter iv
the garden in the squar
as it chanc godfrei did see isobel onc more befor he left england
it wa arrang that he wa to leav chare cross for switzerland
earli on a certain wednesdai morn late on the tuesdai afternoon
mr knight brought the lad to the chare cross hotel there have
taken hi ticket and made all other necessari arrang he left
him return himself to essex by the even train their farewel
wa somewhat disconcert at ani rate to the mind of the youth
hi father retir with him to hi room at the top of the hotel and
there administ a carefulli prepar lectur which touch upon
everi point of the earnest christian duti end up with admonit
on the danger of the world the flesh and the devil and a strong
caution against frivol unbeliev and evildispos person
especi such as were young goodlook and wore petticoat
woman said mr knight is the great danger of man she is the
devil favourit bait at least to some natur of which i fear your
is on though that is strang as i mai sai that on the whole i have
alwai dislik the sex and i marri for other reason than those
which ar suppos to be common woman he went on warm to hi
topic although allow upon the world as a necessari evil is a
paint snare full of he meant bait with guil you will rememb
that the first woman in her wick desir to make him as bad as
herself tempt adam until he at the appl no doubt under threat of
estrang herself from him if he did not and all the result that
came from her iniqu on of which is that men have had to work hard
ever sinc
here godfrei reflect that there wa someon behind who tempt the
woman also that it is better to work than to sit in a garden in
etern idl and lastli that a desir for knowledg is natur
and praiseworthi had isobel been in hi place she would have advanc
these argument probabl in vigor and point languag but have
learnt someth of adam lesson he wa wiser and held hi tongu
there is thi peculiar about women continu hi parent which i
beg you alwai to rememb it is that when you think she is do what
you want and that she love you you ar do what she want and
realli she onli love herself therefor you must never pai attent
to her soft word and especi bewar of her tear which ar her
strongest weapon given to her by the father of deceit to enabl her to
make fool of men do you understand
ye said godfrei with hesit but thi burst from him
involuntarili but father if you have alwai avoid women as you
sai how do you know all thi about them
for a moment mr knight wa stagger then he rose to the occas
i know it godfrei by observ the effect of their art on other
as i have done frequent
a pictur rose in godfrei mind of hi father with hi ey to
keyhol or peer through fenc with wideopen ear but wise he
did not pursu the subject
my son continu and end mr knight i have watch you close
and i am sure that your weak li thi wai woman is and alwai
will be the sin that doth so easili beset you even as a child you
love mr parson much more than you did me becaus although old and
unsightli she is still femal when you left your home thi morn
for the first time who wa it that you griev to part from not your
companion the other boi but mr parson again whom i found you
embrac in that foolish fashion ye and mingl your tear with
her of which at your ag you should be asham inde i believ that
you feel be separ from that garrul person who is but a
servant more than you do from me your father
here he wait for godfrei contradict but as none came went on
with ad acerb
of that angui in herba that viper isobel who turn the pure milk
of the word to poison and bite the hand that fed her i will sai
noth noth here godfrei reflect that isobel would have been
better describ as a lion in the path rather than as a snake in the
grass except that i rejoic that you ar to be separ from her
and i strictli forbid ani commun between you and her bold
godless and revolutionari as she is i had rather see ani man for whose
welfar i care marri to a virtuou and piousmind housemaid than
to thi young ladi as she is call with all her wealth and posit
who would eat out hi soul with her acid unbelief and turn the world
upsid down to satisfi her fanci now i must go or i shall miss my
train here is a present for you of which i direct you to read a
chapter everi dai and he produc out of a brown paper parcel a larg
french bibl it will both do you good and improv your knowledg of
the french tongu i especi commend your attent to certain
vers in proverb deal with the danger on which i have touch
that i have mark with a blue pencil do you hear
ye father solomon wrote proverb didnt he
it is believ so and hi wideexperienceg a special valu to
hi counsel you will write to me onc a week and when you have had
your dinner get to bed at onc on no account ar you to go out into
the street goodby
then he plant a frosti kiss upon godfrei brow and depart leav
that youth full of reflect but to tell the truth somewhat
reliev
shortli afterward godfrei descend to the coffeeroom and at hi
dinner here it wa that the univers temptress against whom he had
been warn so urgent put in a first appear in the person of a
pleasant and elderli ladi who wa seat alongsid of him note thi
goodlook and lone lad she began to talk to him and be a
woman of the world soon knew all about him hi name who he wa
whither he wa go etc when she found out that it wa to lucern
or rather it immedi neighbourhood she grew quit interest
sinc as it happen sheher name wa miss ogilvyhad a hous there
where she wa accustom to spend most of the year inde she wa
return by the same train that godfrei wa to take on the follow
morn
we shall be travel companion she said when she had explain
all thi

wealth upon her person you see he ad colour i am go
second and have to spend as littl as possibl inde i have brought
some food with me in a basket so that i shall not need to bui ani meal
at the station
miss ogilvi wa touch but laugh the matter off in her charm
wai sai that he would have to be care that the customhous
offic did not think he wa smuggl someth in hi basket and as
she knew them all must look to her to help him if he got into
difficulti on the journei then she went on chat and draw him
out and what is more made him take sever glass of some delici
white wine she wa drink it wa not veri strong wine but except
for a littl small beer practic godfrei had been brought up as a
teetotal for economi sake and it went to hi head he becam
rather effus he told her of sir john blake about whom she seem to
know everyth alreadi and someth of hi friendship with isobel
who he ad wa come out that veri night at a fanci dress ball in
london
i know said miss ogilvi at the de lisl in grosvenor squar i
wa ask to it but could not go as i am start tomorrow
then she rose and said goodnight bid him be sure not to be late
for the train as she would want him to help her with her luggag
so off she went look veri charm and graciou although she wa
over forti and leav godfrei quit flatter by her attent
not know what to do he put on hi hat and walk across the
station yard took hi stand by a gatewai pillar and watch the tide
of london life roll by there he remain for nearli an hour sinc the
strang sight fascin him who had never been in town befor the
object of some attent from a policeman although of thi he wa
unawar also some rather odd ladi spoke to him from time to time
which he thought kind of them although thei smelt so peculiar and
seem to have paint upon their face in answer to the inquiri of
two of them as to hi health he told them that he wa veri well also
he agre cordial with a third as to the extrem fine of the
night and assur a fourth that he had no wish to take a walk as he
wa shortli go to bed a statement which caus her to break into
uncalledfor laughter
it wa at thi point that the doubt policeman suggest that he
should move on
where to ask godfrei of that offic of the law
to ell if you like he repli then struck with curios he
inquir where do you want to go to thi pillar aint a lean
post
godfrei consid the matter and said with the verv of slight
intox
onli two place appeal to me at present heaven not hell as you
suggest and grosvenor squar perhap howev thei ar the same
at ani rate there is an angel in both of them
the policeman stare at him but could find no fault with the perfect
sobrieti of hi appear
young luni i suspect he mutter to himself then said aloud
well the strand doesnt lead to eaven so far as i have notic
rather tother wai inde but if you want grosvenor squar it over
there and he wave hi hand vagu toward the west

that is so i will leav heaven to itself for the present and content
myself with grosvenor squar
off he start in the direct indic and as it seem to him
walk for mani mile through a long and bewild seri of
brilliant street continu seek new inform as to hi goal
the end of it wa that at about a quarter to eleven he found himself
somewher in the neighbourhood of the edgwar road utterli strand as
it were sinc hi mind seem incap of appreci further
indic of local
look here young man said a breezi costermong to whom he had
appeal i think you had better take a ansom for the ors will know

hi fare began to explain the situat through the littl trap in the
roof demonstr to the jehu that hi object wa to observ the ball
from without not to danc at it within and that it wa necessari for
him to drive on a littl further that worthi grew indign
blow if i dont believ your a bilk he shout through the hole

border by a gravel path the pair walk along the path godfrei
follow at a distanc till thei came to a recess seat on which
thei sat down he halt behind a lilac bush ten pace or so awai not
that he want to listen but becaus he wa asham to show himself
inde he stop hi ear with hi finger that he might not overhear
their talk but he did not shut hi ey and as the path curv here

he held the flower to her and she bent forward to touch it with her
lip suddenli he did the same and their lip came veri close togeth
on either side of the rose
thi wa too much for godfrei he glide forward as the strai cat
might have done of which the fine knight had spoken mean to
interrupt them
then he rememb suddenli that he had no right to interfer that it

isobel chose to give rose to some friend of her at a danc she wa
not hi properti but onli a girl with whom he chanc to have been
brought up and who found him a pleasant companion when there wa no
on els at hand
by natur as ha been record godfrei wa intens proud and then
and there he made a resolut that he would have noth more to do
with isobel never again would he hang about the skirt of that fine
and rich young ladi who on the night that he wa go awai could give
rose to anoth man just becaus he wa a lord and goodlookingy
and kiss them too hi father wa quit right about women and he would
take hi advic to the letter and begin to studi proverb forthwith

sundai in time for djeuner
a few minut later godfrei found himself pack in a rumbl old
dilig amidst a number of peasant women with basket also there wa
a roman cathol priest who sat opposit to the pasteur for a while
these two ei each other with evid animos just like a pair of
rival dog godfrei thought to himself
at the outskirt of the town thei pass a shrine in which wa the
imag of some saint the priest cross himself and bow so low that
he struck the knee of the pasteur who remonstr in an elabor and
sarcast fashion then the fight began and those two holi men
belabour each other with word not fist for the rest of the
journei godfrei french wa sadli to seek still befor it wa done
he did wonder whether all their languag wa strictli christian for
such word as sapristi and nom de dieu accompani by snap of
the finger and angri stare struck him as show a contenti and
even a hostil spirit moreov that wa not the end of it sinc of
the occup of the dilig about on half seem to belong to the
parti of the priest and the other half to the parti of the pasteur
by degre all of these were drawn into the conflict thei shout and
scream at each other thei wave their arm and incident their
basket on of which struck godfrei on the nose and inde nearli
came to actual fisticuff
appar the driver wa accustom to such scene for after a glanc
through hi littl window he took no further notic so it went on
until at last he pull up and shout
voyageur pour kleindorf descendez vite sil vou plait
here we do get down young monsieur said the pasteur suddenli
relaps into a kind of unnatur calm inde at the door he turn
and bow polit to hi adversari wish him bon voyag to which
the priest repli with a solemn benedict in the most cathol form
he is not bad of heart that priest said the pasteur as he led the
wai to the gate of a littl shrubberi but he do try to steal my
sheep and i protect them from him the bloodtooth wolf jean jean
a brawni swiss appear and seiz the baggag then thei advanc
across the belt of shrubberi to a lawn through which ran a path lo
in the centr of that lawn grew such a fruittre cover with larg
cherri or small plum as godfrei had describ to miss ogilvi and
beyond it stood the long white hous old and big and peac
look what he had not describ becaus of them hi sublimin
sens had given him no inkl were the two ladi who sat expect
on the verandah that command a beauti view of the lake and the
mountain beyond
by a kind of instinct distil from hi experi of clergymen
belong godfrei had expect to see a dowdi femal with a red fat
face and wateri ey perhap wear an apron and a black dress
hook awri accompani by a snubnos littl girl with straight
hair and a cold in the head in place of these he saw a
fashionablydress parisianlook ladi who still seem quit
young veri pleasant to behold with her dark ey and grace
movement and a girl appar about hi own ag who wa equal
attract
she wa brownei with a quick mobil face and a lith and shape
if as yet somewhat unform figur the long thick plait in which her
chestnut hair wa arrang could not hide it plenitud and beauti
while the small of her hand and feet show breed as did her
manner and presenc the observ godfrei at hi first sight of
juliett for such wa her name marvel how it wa possibl that she
should be the daughter of that plain and ungainli old pasteur on thi
point it is enough to sai that other had experienc the same wonder
and remain with their curios unsatisfi but then he might as
well have inquir how he godfrei came to be hi father son sinc
in the whole univers no two creatur could have been more divers
monsieur boiset waddl forward with a gait like to that of a
superannu duck follow at some distanc by godfrei and the
stalwart jean with the luggag
my dear he call out in hi high voic i have found our new
littl friend the train brought him safe here he is
madam and juliett look about them
i see him not said madam
where is he ask juliett in a pleasant girlish voic still at
the gate and sai then my father thi in low tone meant not to be
overheard who is thi monsieur
he is the littl boi exclaim the pasteur chuckl at hi joke
but you see he ha grown in the train
mon dieu exclaim madam i wonder if hi bed will be long
enough
it is veri amus remark juliett
then thei both descend from the verandah to greet him with foreign
cordial which as thei spoke rapidli in french wa somewhat lost on
godfrei recogn their kind intent howev he took off hi
hat and bow to each in turn remark as he did so
bonjour oui oui bonjour the onli word in the gallic tongu
that occur to him at the moment
i speek engleesh said juliett with solemn grandeur
im jolli glad to hear it repli godfrei and i parl franai
or soon shall i hope
such wa godfrei introduct to hi new home at kleindorf where
veri soon he wa happi enough notwithstand hi strang appear
and hi awkward monsieur boiset prove himself to be what is
call a dear old gentleman moreov realli learn and thi in
sundri differ direct thu he wa an excel astronom and
the possessor of a firstrat telescop mount in a littl
observatori on a rocki peak of ground which rose up a hundr feet or
more in the immedi neighbourhood of the hous that itself stood
high thi instrument which it owner had acquir secondhand at some
sale of cours wa not of the largest size still it wa power
enough for all ordinari observ and to show mani hundr of the
heavenli bodi that ar invis to the nake ey even in the clear
air of switzerland
to godfrei who had it will be rememb a strong like for
astronomi it wa a sourc of constant delight what is more it
provid a link of common interest that soon ripen into friendship
between himself and hi odd old tutor who had been oblig hitherto to
pursu hi astral research in solitud sinc to madam and to
juliett these did not appeal night by night especi after the
winter snow began to fall thei would sit by the stove in the littl
observatori gaze at the star make calcul in which
notwithstand hi dislik of mathemat godfrei soon becam expert
and set down the result of what thei learn
in wa in cours of these studi that the whole wonder of the univers
came home to him for the first time he look upon the marvel of the
heaven the mighti process of the planet the rise and set
of the vast sun that burn beyond them in the depth of space weigh
their bulk and measur their differ and trembl with mingl
joi and aw were these the heritag of man would he ever visit them
in some unknown state and ag or must thei remain etern far and
alien thi is what he long to learn and to him astronomi wa a
gatewai to knowledg if onli he could discov how to pass the gate
godfrei had not the true scientif spirit or a yearn for
inform even about the star for it own sake he want to
ascertain how these affect him and the human race of which he wa a
member in short he sought an answer to the old question ar we
mere the spawn of our littl earth destin to perish as the earth
itself must do on dai or through whatev chang we must pass ar
we as immort as the univers and the might that made it whatev
that mai be that wa hi problem the same which perplex everi high
and think soul and at thi impression period of hi life it
scarc ever left him there he would sit with brood ey and bent
brow seek the answer but as yet find none
onc juliett discov him thu have come to the observatori to
tell him that hi dinner had been wait for half an hour and for a
while watch him unnot with the littl shade lamp shine on hi
face instantli in her quick fashion she christen him hibou and
hibou or owl becam hi nicknam in that establish inde with
hi dark ey and strongli mark featur wrap in a contempl
calm such as the studi of the star engend in that gloom he did
look someth like an owl howev differ mai have been hi
appear on other occas
what ar you think of monsieur godfrei she ask
he came back to earth with a start
the star and man he answer colour
mon dieu she exclaim i think man is enough to studi without
the star which we shall never visit
how do you know that mademoisel
i know it becaus we ar here and thei ar there far far awai also
we die and thei go on for ever
what is space and what ar death and time queri godfrei with
solemn
mon dieu said juliett again come to dinner the chicken it
grow cold but to herself she ad he is an odd bird thi english
hibou but attractivewhen he is not so grave
meanwhil godfrei continu to ponder hi mighti problem when he had
master enough french in which madam and juliett prove effici
instructor he propound it to the old pasteur who clap hi hand
upon a bibl and said
there is the answer young friend
i know repli godfrei but it doe not quit satisfi i feel that
i must find that answer for myself
monsieur boiset remov hi blue spectacl and look at him
such search ar danger he said believ me godfrei it is
better to accept
then why do you find fault with the roman cathol monsieur
the question wa like a match appli to a haystack at onc the
pasteur took fire
becaus thei accept error not truth he began what foundat have
thei for much of their belief it is not here and again he slap
the bibl
then follow a long tirad for the on thing thi good and toler
old man could not endur wa the roman cathol branch of the christian
faith
godfrei listen with patienc till at last the pasteur have burnt
himself out ask him if he were not convinc
i do not know he repli these quarrel of the church and of the
differ faith puzzl and tire me i too monsieur believ in god
and a futur life but i do not think it matter much by what road on
travel to them i mean so long as it is a road
the pasteur look at him alarm and exclaim
sure you will not be a fish caught in the net which alreadi i have
observ that cun and plausibl cur try to throw about you oh
what then should i answer to your father
do not be frighten monsieur i shall never becom a roman cathol
but all the same i think the roman cathol veri good peopl and that
their faith is as well as anoth at ani rate for those who believ
it
then he made an excus to slip awai leav the pasteur puzzl
he is wrong he said to himself most wrong but all the same let
it be admit that the boi ha a big mind and intelligenty
intellig
it is certain that those who search with suffici earnest end in
find someth though the discov path mai run in the wrong
direct or prove impass or wind through cavern or along the
edg of precipic down which sooner or later the travel fall or
lead at length to some culdesac the axiom wa not vari in
godfrei case and the path he found wa namedmiss ogilvi
on the first sundai after hi arriv at kleindorf a fine carriag and
pair drew up at the shrubberi gate just as the famili were return
from the morn servic in the littl church where the pasteur
minist madam sigh when she saw it for she would have love
dearli to possess such an equipag as inde she had done at on
period in her career befor an obscur seri of circumst led to
her strang union with monsieur boiset
what beauti hors exclaim juliett her hazel ey sparkl
oh that tenth command who can keep it and why should some
peopl have fine hors and other not even a poni ma mre why were
you not abl to keep that carriag of which you have spoken to me so
often
madam bit her lip and with a whisper hold your tongu plung
into convers about miss ogilvi then godfrei enter the carriag
and wa whirl awai in style look like the princ in a fairi book
as juliett remark while the pasteur tri to explain to her how
much happier she wa without the temptat of such earthli vaniti
miss ogilvi hous wa a beauti dwell of it sort stand in
garden of it own that ran down to the lake and command fine view
of all the gloriou sceneri which surround lucern the room were
larg and lofti with parquet floor and in some of them were realli
good pictur that their owner had inherit also collect of
beauti old french furnitur in short it wa a state and refin
abod such as is sometim to be found abroad in the possess of
american or english peopl of wealth who for their health sake or
other reason make their home upon the contin
on hear the carriag arriv miss ogilvi who wa dress in a
simpl but charm grei gown and as godfrei notic at onc wore
round her neck the old gnostic talisman which he had given her came
from a saloon to meet him in the larg squar hall
i am glad to see you godfrei she said in her soft cultiv
voic
so am i miss ogilvi he answer with hearti i mean to see
you but he ad studi her you do not look veri well
she smile rather pathet and said in a quick voic
no i took a cold on that journei you see i am rather an invalid
which is why i live herewhil i do livewhat thei call
poitrinair
godfrei shook hi head the word wa beyond him
anglic consumpt she explain there ar lot of us in
switzerland you know and on the whole we ar a merri set it is
characterist of our complaint but never mind about me there ar two
or three peopl here i daresai you will think them odd but thei ar
clever in their wai and you ought to have someth in common come
in
he follow her into the beauti cool saloon with it larg doubl
french window design to keep out the bitter wind of winter but
open now upon the brilliant garden never befor had he been in so
love a room that is of a modern hous and it impress him with
sensat that at the moment he did not try to analys all he knew
wa that thei were mingl with some spiritu qualiti such as onc or
twice he had felt in ancient church someth which suggest both
the past and the futur and a brood influenc that he could not
defin yet the place wa all light and charm gai with flower and
landscap pictur in short lack ani sombr note
gather at it far end where the bow window overlook the sparkl
lake were three or four peopl all elderli instantli on of these
rivet hi attent she wa stout have her grei hair drawn back
from a massiv forehead beneath which shone pierc black ey her
rather ungainli figur wa cloth in what he thought an ugli green
dress and she wore a necklet of emerald in an oldfashion set
which he also thought ugli but strike from the moment that he
enter the doorwai at the far end of that long saloon he felt those
black ey fix upon him and wa painfulli awar of their owner
presenc so much so that in a whisper he ask her name of miss
ogilvi
oh she answer that is madam rienn the note mesmerist and
medium
inde said godfrei in a vagu voic for he did not quit
understand what wa meant by thi descript
also there wa a thin elderli american gentleman to whom godfrei wa
introduc name colonel josiah smith and a big blond dane who
talk english with a german accent call professor petersen all of
these studi godfrei with the most unusu interest as overwhelm
with shyness he wa led by miss ogilvi to make their acquaint he
felt that their demeanour portend he knew not what more at ani rate
than hope of deriv pleasur from hi societi in fact that thei
expect to get someth out of him suddenli he recollect a pictur
that onc he had seen in a piou work which he wa given to read on
sundai it repres a missionari be led by the hand by a smile
woman into the presenc of some savag in a south sea island who were
about to cook and eat him
in the pictur a larg pot wa alreadi boil over a fire in the
background instinct godfrei look for the pot but saw none
except on of the flower which stood on a littl tabl in a recess
and round it half a dozen chair on of them larg with arm had he
but known it that chair wa the pot
no sooner had he made hi somewhat awkward bow than luncheon wa
announc and thei all went into anoth larg and beauti room
where thei were serv with a perfect meal the convers at tabl
wa gener and in english but present it drift into a debat
which godfrei did not understand on the increas of spiritu among
the initi of the earth
colonel josiah smith who appear to associ with remark person
whom he call master who dwelt in the remot place of the world
alleg that such increas wa great which professor petersen who
dwelt much among german intellectu deni it appear that these
intellectu were busi in turn their back on everi form of
spiritu
ah said miss ogilvi with a sigh thei seek the compani of their
kindr element although thei do not know it and soon those
element will have the masteri of them and break them to piec as
the lion did the malign of daniel
in after year godfrei alwai rememb thi as a veri remark
propheci but at the time not know what an element might be he
onli marvel
at length madam rienn who it seem wa half french and half
russian interven in a slow heavi voic
what doe it matter friend of my soul she ask then have
paus to drink off a full glass of sparkl mosel she went on
soon we shall be where the spiritu or otherwis of thi littl
world matter noth to us who will be the first to learn the truth
i wonder and she stare in turn at the face of everi on of them a
process which seem to caus gener alarm bear as it did a
strong resembl to the smellingout of savag witchdoctor
inde thei all began to talk of thi or that at hazard but she wa
not to be put off by such interrupt have investig godfrei
till he felt cold down the back madam turn her searchlight ey
upon miss ogilvi who shrank beneath them then of a sudden she
exclaim with a kind of convuls shudder
the power possess and guid me it tell me that you will be the
first sister helen i see you among the immort lili with the wine
of life flow through your vein
on receipt of thi inform the wine of life seem to ceas to flow
in poor miss ogilvi face at ani rate she went deadli pale and
rest her hand upon godfrei shoulder as if she were about to faint
recov a littl she murmur to herself
i thought it well what doe it matter though the gulf is great and
terribl
then with an effort she rose and suggest that thei should return to
the drawingroom
thei did so and were serv with turkish coffe and cigarett which
madam rienn smoke on after the other veri rapidli present miss
ogilvi rang the bell and when the butler appear to remov the cup
whisper someth in french at which he bow and depart
godfrei thought he heard him lock the door behind him but wa not sure

then he went feel rather uncomfort and yet interest though
what it wa that interest him he did not quit know that night he
dream that madam rienn stood by hi bed watch him with her
burn ey it wa an unpleas dream
he kept hi word when the boiset famili especi madam
crossexamin him as to the detail of hi visit to miss ogilvi he
mere describ the splendour of that opul establish and the
intellectu charact of it guest of their mystic attribut he
said noth at all onli ad that miss ogilvi propos to do
herself the honour of call at the maison blanch as the boiset
hous wa call
about the middl of the week miss ogilvi arriv and as madam had
taken care to be at home in expect of her visit wa entertain
to tea afterward she visit the observatori which interest her
much and had a long talk with the curiou old pasteur who also
interest her in hi wai for as she afterward remark to godfrei
on doe not often meet an embodi of human good and chariti
when he repli that the latter qualiti wa lack to the pasteur
where roman cathol were concern she onli smile and said that
everi jewel had it flaw noth wa quit perfect in the world
in the end she ask madam and juliett to come to lunch with her
leav out godfrei becaus as she said she knew that he would be
engag at hi studi with the pasteur she explain also that she
did not ask them to come with him on sundai becaus thei would be taken
up with their religi duti a remark at which juliett made what
the french call a mouth and madam smile faintli
in due cours she and her daughter went to lunch and return
delight have found themselv fellowguest of some of the most
notabl peopl in lucern though not those whom miss ogilvi
entertain on sundai needless to sai from that time forward
godfrei intimaci with thi charm and wealthi hostess wa in everi
wai encourag by the boiset famili
the cours of thi intimaci doe not need ani veri long descript
everi sundai after church the wellappoint carriag and pair appear
and bore godfrei awai to luncheon at the villa ogilvi here he alwai
met madam rienn colonel josiah smith and professor petersen also
occasion on or two other with whom these seem to be
suffici intim to admit of their address them as brother or
sister
soon godfrei came to understand that thei were all member of some kind
of semisecret societi though what thi might be he could not quit
ascertain all he made sure of wa that it had to do with matter which
were not of thi world noth concern mundan affair howev
import or interest seem to appeal to them all their
convers wa direct toward what might be call spiritu
problem reincarn karma it took him a long time to understand
what a karma is astral shape mediumship telepath influenc
celesti guid and the rest
at first thi talk with it jargon of word which he did not
comprehend bore him consider but by degre he felt that he wa
be drawn into a vortex and began to understand it drift even
while it wa enigmat it acquir a kind of unholi attract for him
and he began to seek out it secret mean in which he found that
compani readi instructor
young brother said madam rienn we deal with the thing not of
the bodi but of the soul the bodi what is it in a few year it will
be dust and ash but the soulit is eternaland all those star you
studi ar it inherit and you and i if we cultiv our spiritu
part shall rule in them
then she would roll her big ey and becom in a wai magnific so
that godfrei forgot her ugli and the repuls with which she
inspir him
in the end hi outlook on life and the world becam differ and thi
not so much becaus of what he learn from hi esoter teacher as
through some chang in hi intern self he grew to appreci the
vast of thing and the infinit possibl of exist inde
hi spiritu educ wa a fit pendant to hi physic studi of
the heaven peopl with unnumb world each of them the home
doubtless of an infinit varieti of life and each of them keep it
aw secret lock in it float orb he trembl in presenc of
the stupend whole of which thu by degre he becam awar and
though it frighten him thought with piti of the busi million of
mankind to whom such mysteri ar noth at all who ar lost in
their busi or idl in their eat drink sleep
lovemak and gener satisfact of the instinct which thei
possess in common with everi other anim the yearn for wisdom the
desir to know enter hi young heart and possess it as onc these
did that of solomon to such a degre inde that stand on the
threshold of hi dai he would have paid them all awai and with them
hi share in thi warm and breath world could he have been assur
that in exchang he would receiv the kei of the treasurehous of the
infinit
such an attitud wa neither healthi nor natur to a normal vigor
lad just enter upon manhood and as will be seen it did not
endur like everyth els it had it caus hi astronom
studi were on of these but a deeper reason wa to be found in those
sundai sanc at the villa ogilvi for a long while godfrei did not
know what happen to him on these occas the parti sat round the
littl tabl talk of wonder thing madam rienn look at him
and sometim took hi hand which he did not like and then he
rememb no more until he woke up feel tire and yet in a wai
exhilar for with the mysteri of hypnot sleep he wa not yet
acquaint nor did it occur to him that he wa be us a medium by
certain of the most advanc spiritualist in the world
by degre howev inkl of the truth began to come thu on dai
hi conscious awok while hi bodi seem still to be wrapt in
tranc and he saw that there wa a person present who had not been of
the parti when he went to sleep a young woman clad in a white robe
with love hair flow down her back stood by hi side and held hi
supin finger in her hand
she wa beauti and yet unearthli she wore ornament also but as
he watch to hi amaz these seem to chang what had been a
fillet of white stone like diamond which bound her hair turn to
on of red stone like rubi and as it did so the colour of her
ey which were larg and veri tranquil alter
she wa speak in a low rich voic to miss ogilvi who answer
address her as sister eleanor but what she said godfrei could not
understand someth of hi inner shock and fear must have reflect
itself upon hi trancebound featur for suddenli he heard madam
rienn exclaim
have done the medium awak and i tell you it is danger while our
guid is here back to hi breast eleanor thenc to your place
the tall figur chang it becam misti shapeless it seem to fall
on him like a cloud of ici vapour chill him to the heart and
through that vapour he could see the ormolu clock which stood on a
bracket in the recess and even note the time which wa thirteen
minut past four after thi he becam unconsci and in due cours
woke up as usual the first thing hi ey fell on wa the clock of
which the hand now point to a quarter to five and the sight of it
brought everyth back to him then he observ that all the circl
seem much agit and distinctli heard madam rienn sai to
professor petersen in english
the thing wa veri near had it not been for that medicin of
your it wa becaus that speerit do take hi hand she grow fond
of him it happen sometim if the medium be of the other sex and
attract she want to carri him awai with her that control and i
expect she never quit leav him all hi life becaus you see she
materi out of him and therefor belong to him next time she
come i give her my mind hush our wonder littl brother wake
upquit right thi time
then godfrei realli open hi ey hitherto he had been feign to
be still in tranc but thought it wisest to sai noth at thi
moment miss ogilvi turn veri pale and went into a kind of light faint
the professor produc some kind of smellingbottl from hi pocket
which he held to her nostril she came to at onc and began to laugh
at her own silli but beg them all to go awai and leav her
quiet which thei did godfrei wa go too but she stop him
sai that the carriag would not be readi till after tea and that it
wa too wet for him to walk in the garden for now autumn had come in
earnest the tea arriv a substanti tea with poach egg of

on sundai
miss ogilvi tri to sooth him

delight spirit and declar that she knew you veri intim
inde when you were an earli egyptian also much befor that on the
lost contin which is call atlanti to sai noth of deep
friendship which have exist between you in other planet
i sai exclaim godfrei do you believ all thi
well if you ask me i must sai that i do i am sure that we have all
of us live mani live here and elsewher and if thi is so it is
obviou that in the cours of them we must have met an enorm number
of peopl with certain of whom we have been close associ in the
variou relationship of life some of these no doubt come round with
us again but other do not though we can get into touch with them
under except circumst that is your case and eleanor at
present you ar upon differ sphere but in the futur no doubt
you will find yourselv side by side again as you have often been in
due cours to be driven apart onc more by the wind of destini and
perhap after ag final to be unit meanwhil she plai the part
of on of your guardian angel
then i wish she wouldnt said godfrei with vigour i dont care
for a guardian angel of whom i have no memori and who seem to fall on
you like snow upon a hot dai if anybodi doe that kind of thing i
should prefer a live woman
which doubtless she ha been and will be again for you see where
she is she ha memori and foreknowledg which ar lack to the
incarn meanwhil through you and becaus of you she can tell us
much you ar the wire which connect us to her in the unseen
then i hope you will find anoth wire i realli do for it upset me
and make me feel ill i know that i shall be afraid to go to bed
tonight and even for you miss ogilvi i wont come next sundai
then as the carriag wa now at the door he jump into it and
depart without wait for an answer
moreov on the next sundai when as usual it arriv to fetch him
at kleindorf godfrei kept hi word so that it went back empti by the
coachman he sent an awkwardli word note to miss ogilvi sai that
he wa suffer from toothach which had prevent him from sleep
for sever night and wa not well enough to come out
thi note she answer by post tell him that she had been
disappoint not to see him as she wa also ill she ad that she
would send the carriag on the follow sundai on the chanc of hi
toothach be better but that if it wa not she would understand
and troubl him no more
dure all that week godfrei fought with himself he did not wish to
have anyth more to do with the white and ghostli eleanor who
chang her gem so constantli and said that she had known him
millennium ago inde he felt alreadi as though she were much too
near him especi at night when he seem to becom awar of her
bend over hi bed and gener make her presenc known in other
uncomfort wai that caus hi hair to stand up and frighten him
at the same time he wa realli fond of miss ogilvi and what she said
about be ill touch him also there wa someth that drew him it
might be eleanor or it might be madam rienn at ani rate he felt a
great long to go put everyth els asid these
investig had their delight what other young fellow of hi ag
could boast an eleanor who said she had been fond of him ten of
thousand of year befor
moreov here wa on of the gate to that knowledg which he desir
so earnestli and how could he find the strength to shut it in hi own
face
of cours the end of the matter wa that by the follow sundai hi
toothach had depart and the carriag did not return empti to the
villa ogilvi
he found hi hostess look white and ether an appear that she
had acquir increasingli ever sinc their first meet her delight
at see him wa obviou as wa that of the other for thi he soon
discov the reason it appear that the sit on the previou
sundai when he wa overcom by toothach had been an almost total
failur professor petersen had tri to fill hi place as medium with
the result that when he fell under the influenc the onli spirit that
broke through hi lip wa on which discours intermin about
lager beer and liqueur of some celesti brew which as madam
rienn a ladi not given to minc her word told him to hi face
afterward wa becaus he drank too much henc the joi of these
enthusiast at the reappear of godfrei
with consider reluct that youth consent to plai hi usual
rle and to be put into a charm sleep by madam thi time he saw no
eleanor and knew noth of what happen until he awok to be greet
by the horrif spectacl of miss ogilvi ly back in her chair bath
in blood gener confus reign in the midst of which madam
rienn alon wa calm
it is hmorrhag from the lung she said which is common among
poitrinair brother petersen do what you can and you brother
smith fly for mademoisel doctor and if he is not at home bring
anoth
later godfrei heard what had chanc it seem that the wraith or
eman or the sprite good or evil or whatev it mai have been
which call itself eleanor materi in a veri ugli temper it
complain that it had not been allow to appear upon the previou
sundai and had been kept awai from it brother ie godfrei then it
proceed to threaten all the circl except godfrei who wa the real
culprit with diver misfortun especi direct it wrath
against miss ogilvi
you will die soon it said and in the spirit world i will pai you
back thrice it repeat thi you will die to which miss ogilvi
answer with calm digniti
i am not afraid to die nor am i at all afraid of you eleanor who
as i now see ar not good but evil
while she spoke a torrent of blood burst from her lip eleanor
disappear and almost immedi godfrei awok
in due cours the doctor came and announc that the hmorrhag had
ceas and that the patient wa in no immin danger as to the
futur he could sai noth except that have been miss ogilvi
medic attend for some year he had expect someth of thi
sort to happen and known that her life could not be veri long
then godfrei went home veri terrifi and chasten blame himself
also for thi dread event although in truth no on could have been
more innoc he had grown veri fond of miss ogilvi and shudder to
think that she must soon leav the world to seek a dim unknown where
there were bad spirit as well as good
he shudder too at the thought of thi eleanor who made us of him
to appear in human form and on hi knee prai god to protect him
from her thi inde happen if she had ani real exist and wa
not some mere creation of the brain of madam rienn made visibl by
the work of law whereof we have no knowledg never again dure
all hi life did he actual see ani more of eleanor and the
probabl is that he never will either here or elsewher
three dai later godfrei receiv a letter from the doctor sai that
miss ogilvi wish to see him and that he recommend him not to delai
hi visit have obtain the permiss of the pasteur he went in at
onc by the dilig and on arriv at the villa where evid he
wa expect wa shown up to a bedroom which command a beauti
view of the lake and mount pilatu here a nurs met him and told him
that he must not stai long a quarter of an hour at the outsid he
ask how mademoisel wa whereon she answer with an express
shrug
soon she will be further from the earth than the top of that mountain
then she took him to anoth smaller room and there upon the bed
look whiter than the sheet lai hi friend she smile veri sweetli
when she caught sight of him
dear godfrei she said it is kind of you to come i want to see
you veri much for three reason first i wish to beg your pardon for
have drawn you into thi spiritu without your know that i wa
do so i have told you what my motiv wa and therefor i will not
repeat it as my strength is small secondli i wish you to promis me
that you will never go to anoth sanc sinc now i am quit sure
that it is danger for the young to me spiritu ha brought much
good and joi but with other it mai be differ especi as among
spirit as on the earth there ar evil be do you promis
ye ye answer godfrei onli i am afraid of madam rienn
you must stand up against her if she troubl you and seek the help
of religion if necessari consult your old pasteur for he is a good
man there is no danger in the world that cannot be escap if onli on
is bold enough or so i think though ala myself i have lack
courag she ad with a gentl sigh
now dear boi she went on after paus to recov strength i have
a third thing to sai to you i have left you some monei as i know that
you will have littl it is not everi much but enough allow for
accid and the lessen of capit valu to give you 260 a year
clear i might have given you more but did not for two reason the
first is that i have observ that young men who have what is call a
compet sai 500 or 600 a year veri often ar content to try and
live on it and to do noth for themselv so that in the end it
becom not a bless but a curs the second is that to do so i
should be oblig to take awai from certain chariti and institut
which i wish to benefit that is all i have to sai about monei oh no
there is on more thing i have also left you the talisman you gave me
and with it thi hous and ground perhap on dai you might like to
live here i have a sort of feel that it will be us to you at
some great crisi of your fate and at least it will remind you of me
who have love and tri to beautifi the place in ani case it will
alwai let and if it becom a white eleph you can sell it and the
furnitur which is worth someth
godfrei began to stammer hi thank but she cut him short with a wave
of her hand murmur
dont let us wast more time on such thing for soon you must go
awai alreadi i see that nurs look at me from the doorwai of the
other room and i have someth more to sai to you you will come to
think that all thi spiritu as it is call is noth but a
danger folli well it is danger like climb the alp but on
get a great view from the top and oh from there how small men look
and how near ar the heaven i mean my dear boi that although i have
ask you to abjur sanc and so forth i do prai of you to cultiv
the spiritu the physic of cours is alwai with us for that is
natur law without which it could not continu but around and
beyond it brood the spirit as onc it did upon the face of the
water encircl all thing the begin of all thing and the
end onli as wine cannot be pour into a cover cup so the spirit
cannot flow into a worldseal heart and what is the cup without the
wine open your heart godfrei and receiv the spirit so that when
the mortal perish the immort mai remain and everlastingli increas
for you know if we choos death we shall die and if we choos life we
shall live we and all that is dear to us
miss ogilvi paus a littl to get her breath then went on now my
boi kiss me and go but firston word more i have taken a strang
affect for you perhap becaus we were associ in other
exist i do not know well i want to sai that from the land
whither i am about to be born it shall be my great endeavour if it
is so allow to watch over you to help you if there be need and in
the end to be among the first to greet you there you or ani whom you
mai love in thi journei of your through life look the sun is
sink now goodby till the dawn
he bent down and kiss her and she kiss him back throw her thin
and feebl arm about hi neck after which the nurs came and hurri
him awai weep at the door he turn back and saw her smile at him
and oh on her wast face were peac and beauti
next dai she di
fortyeight hour later godfrei attend her funer to which the
pasteur boiset wa also bidden and after it wa over thei were both
summon to the offic of a notari where her will wa read she wa a
rich woman who left behind her properti to the valu of quit
100000 most of it in england inde thi swiss notari wa onli
concern with her possess in lucern name the villa ogilvi it
ground and furnitur and certain monei that she had in local
secur or at the bank the hous it appurten and content
were left absolut to godfrei the pasteur boiset be appoint
truste of the properti until the heir came of ag with a legaci of
200 and an annual allow of 100 for hi troubl
moreov with tender care except for certain bequest to servant
the testatrix devot all her swiss monei to be appli to the upkeep
of the place with the proviso that if it were sold these capit sum
should revert to her other heir in certain proport the total of
such monei as would pass with the properti wa estim by the
notari to amount to about 4000 sterl after the payment of all
state charg and legal expens the valu of the properti itself
with the fine old french furnitur and pictur which it contain wa
also consider but unascertain for the rest it would appear that
godfrei inherit about 12000 in england togeth with a possibl
further sum of which the amount wa not known as residuari legate
thi bequest wa vest in the english truste of the testatrix who
were instruct to appli the interest for hi benefit until he reach
the ag of twentyf after which the capit wa to be hand over
to him absolut
godfrei whose knowledg of the french tongu wa still limit and
who wa overcom with grief moreov after the sad scene through which
he had just pass listen to all these detail with bewilder he
wa not even elat when the grave notari shook hi hand and
congratul him with the respect that is accord to an heir at the
same time express a hope that he would be allow to remain hi
legal repres in switzerland inde the lad onli mutter
someth and slip awai behind the servant whose sorrow wa
distract by the exercis of mental arithmet as to the amount of
their legaci
after hi first stupefact howev the pasteur could not conceal
hi innoc joi a legaci of 200 a trusteeship of the most
import as he call it and an allow of 100 for year to
come were to him wonder wealth and honour
truli dear young friend he said to godfrei as thei left the

enter my humbl hous now i am not onli your instructor but the
guardian of your magnific lucern properti i assur you that i will
care for it well tomorrow i will interview those domest and
dismiss at least half of them for there ar far too mani
chapter vii
mr knight and duti
the pair return to kleindorf by the even dilig and among the
passeng wa that same priest who had been their companion on the dai
of godfrei arriv as usual he wa prepar to be bellicos and
figur trail the tail of hi coat befor hi ancient enemi
but the pasteur would not tread on them inde so mild and
conciliatori were hi answer that at last the priest who wa a good
soul at bottom grew anxiou and inquir if he were ill
no no said a voic from the recess of the dark coach monsieur
le pasteur ha come into monei oh i have heard
is it so now i understand remark the priest with a sniff i
fear that he had lost hi health
then thei arriv at kleindorf and the convers end with mutual
bow
great wa the excit of madam and juliett at the new which thei
brought with them to their ear godfrei inherit sound a tale
of untold wealth nearli 300000 franc why thei did not know anyon
in the neighbourhood of kleindorf who own so much and then that fine
hous with it garden and love furnitur which wa the talk of
lucern and the pasteur with hi 5000 franc clear to be paid
immedi plu an incom of 2500 for the next eight year here
were rich inde it wa wonder and all after an acquaint of
onli a few month thei look at godfrei with admir truli he
must be a remark youth who wa thu abl to attract the love of the
wealthi
an idea occur to madam why should he not marri juliett she wa
vivaci and pretti fit in everi wai to becom a great ladi even
perhap to adorn the love villa ogilvi in futur year she would
have a word with juliett and show her where fortun lai if the girl
had ani wit it should be as good as assur for with her
opportun
and so doubtless it might have chanc had it not been for a certain
determin and unconvent young woman far awai in england of whom
the persist memori howev much he might flirt quit prevent
godfrei from fall in love as otherwis he ought to and inde
probabl must have done at hi ag and in hi circumst
perhap miss juliett who although young wa no fool also had idea
upon the subject at ani rate at thi time especi as she had found
lhibou alwai attract notwithstand hi stargaz wai and
the shower of wealth that had descend on him as though direct from
the bon dieu did not lessen hi charm if so who could blame her
when on ha been oblig alwai to look at both side of a sou and
realli pretti frock such as ladi wear ar almost as unobtain
as godfrei star monei becom import especi to a girl with
an instinct for dress and a love of life
thenceforward at least as mai be imagin monsieur godfrei becam a
veri promin person inde in the boiset establish all hi
littl tast were consult madam move him into the best spare
bedroom on the ground that the on he occupi would be cold in
winter which when he wa out juliett made a point of adorn with
flower if these were forthcom or fail them with grace sprai
of winter berri also she work him some slipper cover with
littl devil in black silk which she said he must learn to tread
under foot though whether thi might be a covert allus to hi
spiritualist experi or mere a flight of fanci on her part
godfrei did not know
on the even of the read of the will prompt thereto by the
pasteur that young gentleman wrote a letter to hi father a task
which he alwai thought difficult to tell him what had happen as he
found explan imposs it wa brief though the time occupi
in compos draft wa long final it took the follow form
my dear fatheri think i told you that i travel out here with
a ladi name miss ogilvi whom i have often seen sinc she ha

letter
your affection son godfrei
the receipt of thi epistl caus astonish in mr knight not
unmix with irrit why could not the boi be more explicit who
wa miss ogilvi whose name so far as he could recollect he now heard
for the first time and how did she come to leav godfrei so much
monei the stori wa so strang that he began to wonder whether it were
a joke or perhap an hallucin if not there must be a great
deal unrev the letter which godfrei said the pasteur would write
wa not enclos and if it had been probabl would not have help
him much as he did not understand french and could scarc deciph
hi cramp calligraphi lastli he had heard noth from ani lawyer
or truste
in hi bewilder he went straight to hawk hall take the letter
with him with a view to borrow book of refer which might
enabl him to identifi miss ogilvi the butler said that he thought sir
john wa in and show him to the morn room where he found isobel
who inform him that her father had just gone out their meet wa
not affection for as ha been told isobel detest mr knight and
he detest isobel moreov there wa a reason which shall be
explain which just then made him feel uncomfort in her presenc
be there howev he thought it necessari to explain the object of
hi visit
i have had a veri strang letter from that odd boi godfrei he said
which make me want to borrow a book here it is perhap you will
read it as it will save time and explan
i dont want to read godfrei letter said isobel stiffli
it will save time repeat mr knight thrust it toward her
then be overcom by curios she read it the monei part did not
greatli interest her monei wa such a common thing of which she heard
so much what interest her were first miss ogilvi and the
unexplain reason of her bequest and secondli in a more acut
fashion mademoisel boiset who wa pretti and sang so nice miss
ogilvi whoever she might have been at ani rate wa dead but
juliett clearli wa much aliv with her pretti and good voic no
wonder then that she had not heard from godfrei he wa too occupi
with the late miss ogilvi and the veri present mademoisel juliett
in whose father hous he wa live as on of the famili
isobel face howev show none of her wonder she read the
letter quit composedli but with such care that afterward she could
have repeat it by heart then she hand it back sai
well godfrei seem to have been fortun
ye but why i find no explan of thi bequestif there is a
bequest
no doubt there is mr knight godfrei wa alwai most truth and
aboveboard she answer look at him
mr knight flinch and colour at her word and the steadi gaze of
those grei ey she wonder why though she wa not to learn for a
long while
i thought perhap you could lend me some book or book which would
enabl me to find out about miss ogilvi i have never heard of her
befor though i think that in on of hi brief commun godfrei
did mention a ladi who wa kind to him in the train
certainli there ar lot of them who whoonli she would not be
there unless she wa veri rich but you might look peerag theyr
no good as she wa miss ogilvi though of cours she might be the
daughter of a baron counti famili red book etc let try some
of them
so thei did try variou ogilvi there were but none who gave them ani
clue thi wa not strang as both miss ogilvi parent had di in
australia when she wa young leav her to be brought up by an aunt
of anoth name in england who wa also long dead
so mr knight retreat baffl next morn howev a letter
arriv address godfrei knight esq which after hi pleas
fashion he open promptli it prove to be a commun from a
wellknown firm of lawyer which enclos a copi of miss ogilvi
will call special attent to the codicil affect himself duli
execut befor the british consul and hi clerk in lucern gave the
name of the english truste solicit inform as to where the
interest on the sum bequeath wa to be paid and so forth
to thi inquiri mr knight at onc repli that the monei might be
paid to him as the father of the legate and wa furiou when all
sort of object were rais to that cours unless everi kind of
guarante were given that thei would be us sole and strictli for
the benefit of hi son final an account had to be open on which
chequ could be drawn sign by on of the truste and mr knight
thi proviso made the latter even more indign than befor
especi as it wa accompani by an intim that the truste
would requir hi son consent either by letter or in a person
interview to ani arrang as to hi career etc which involv
expenditur of the trust monei when a somewhat rude and lengthi
letter to them to that effect wa met with a curt acknowledg of it
receipt and a refer to their previou decis mr knight
annoy harden into a perman grievanc against hi son whom he
seem to hold respons for what he call an affront to himself
he wa a man with larg idea of patern right of which an exampl
mai be given that wa not without it effect upon the vital interest
of other
when isobel return from london after the fancydress ball at which
she thought she had seen a ghost whilst sit in the squar with her
young admir who wa dress as a knight she wait for a long while
expect to receiv a letter from godfrei as none came although she
knew from mr parson that he had written home sever time she
began to wonder as to the caus of hi silenc then an idea occur
to her
suppos that what she had seen wa no fanci of her mind but godfrei
himself who in some mysteri fashion had found hi wai into that
squar perhap in the hope of see her at the ball in order to sai
goodby thi wa possibl sinc she had ascertain from some casual
remark by hi father that he did not leav london until the follow
morn
if thi had happen if he had seen her plai the fool as she
express it to herself with that goodlook man in the squar what
would he have thought of her she never paus to rememb that he had
no right to think anyth somehow from childhood she acknowledg in
her heart that he had everi right though when she said thi to
herself she did not in the least understand all that the admiss
convei although she bulli and maltreat him at time yet to
herself she alwai confess him to be her lord and master he wa the
on male creatur for whom she care in the whole world inde
put her mother out of the question she care for no other man or
woman and would never learn to do so
for her wa a singular and veri rare instanc of almost undivid
affect centr on a singl object so far as hi sex wa concern
godfrei wa her all a posit of which ani man might well be proud in
the case of ani woman and especi of on who had mani opportun
of devot herself to other in her exampl howev she wa not to
be thank for the reason that she onli follow her natur or
perhap the dictat of that fate which inspir and rule veri great
love whether it be between man and woman between parent and child
between brother and brother or between friend and friend such
feel do not aris or grow thei simpli ar the blossom of a
plant that ha it secret root far awai in the soil of circumst
beyond our ken and that mayhap ha push it branch through
exist without number and in the climat of mani world
so at least it wa with isobel and so it had alwai been sinc she
kiss the sleep child in the old refectori of the abbei she wa
hi and in a wai howev much she might doubt or mistrust her inner
sens and instinct told her that he wa alwai her that so he had
alwai been and so alwai would remain with the advent of womanhood
these truth came home to her with an increas forc becaus she
knewagain by instinctthat thi fact of womanhood multipli the
chanc of attain to the uniti which she desir howev partial
that might still prove to be
yet she knew also that thi great mutual attract did not depend on
sex though by the influenc of sex it might be quicken and
accentu it wa someth much more deep and wide someth which
she did not and perhap never would understand the sex element wa
accident so much so that the passag of a few earthli year would
rob it of it power to attract and make it as though it had never been
but the perfect friendship between their soul wa perman and
without shadow of chang she knew oh she knew although no word of
it had ever been spoken between them that their wa the love etern
the quick percept of her woman mind told her these thing of
which godfrei in it slower growth wa not yet awar
anim by thi new idea that she had realli seen godfrei and what
wa much wors that godfrei had realli seen her upon an occas when
she would have much prefer to remain invis to him she wa
fill with remors and determin to write him a letter like that of
the young man himself to hi father it composit took her a good
deal of time
here it is as copi from her third and final draft
my dear old godfreyi have an idea that you were in the squar
on the night of the fanci ball when i came out and wore that
horrid plantagenet dress which after all did not fit i sent it
to a jumblesal where no on would bui it so i gave it to mr
smili who ha nine children to cut into frock for her littl
girl if you were there instead of rest befor your long
journei as you ought to have done and saw me with a man in armour
and a roseand the rest of cours you will have understood that
thi wa all part of the game you see we had to pretend that we
were knight and ladi who when thei were not cut throat or
be carri off with their hair down seem to have wast their
time in give each other favour and all that sort of bosh we
did not know what a favour wa so we us a rose the truth is
that the young man and hi armour especi hi spur which tore
my dress and everyth about him bore me the more so becaus
all the while i wa think ofwel other thingshow you would
get through your journei and like those french peopl and the
rest so now if you were there you wont be cross and if you
were not and dont understand what i am sai it isnt worth
bother about in ani case you had no right toi mean be
cross it is i who should be cross with you for poke about in a
london squar so late and not come forward to sai how do you do
and be introduc to the knight that is all i have to sai about
the busi so dont write and ask me ani question
there is no new herether never isexcept that i havent been
into that church sinc you left and dont mean to which make
your father look at me as sourli as though he had eaten a whole
hat of crabappl he hate me you know and i rather like
him for show it as it save me the troubl of try to keep
up appear do tell me when you write how to explain hi
ever have been your father if he still want you to go into
the church i advis you to studi the thirtynin articl i read
them all through yesterdai and how anybodi can swear to them in
thi year of grace im sure i dont know thei must shut their
ey and open their mouth like we us to do when we took
powder by the wai did you ever read anyth about buddhism
iv got a book on it which i think rather fine at ani rate it
is a great idea though i think i should find it difficult to
follow the wai
i am sorri to sai that mother is not well at all she cough a
great deal now that essex is get so damp and grow thinner
and thinner the doctor sai she ought to go to egypt onli
father wont hear of it but i wont write about that or we should
have anoth argument on the fourth command goodby dear
old boyyour affection isobel
pswhen you write dont tell me all about switzerland and
snowcov mountain and blue bottomless lake etc which i can
read in book tell me about yourself and what you ar do and
thinkingespeci what you ar think
ppsthat man in armour isnt realli goodlook he ha a
squint also he put scent upon hi hair and cant spell i know
becaus he tri to write a bit of poetri on my programm and got
it all wrong
when she had finish thi somewhat labour epistl isobel rememb
that she had forgotten to ask godfrei to write down hi address
bethink her that it would be known to mr parson she took it
round to the abbei hous propos to add it there as it happen
mr parson wa out so she left it with the housemaid who promis
faithfulli to give it to her when she return with isobel messag
as to write the address on the seal envelop in order that she
might not forget the maid place it on a tabl by the back door by
ill luck howev present through that door came not mr parson
but the rev mr knight he saw the letter address to godfrei knight
esq and though he half pretend to himself that he did not at onc
recogn isobel larg upright hand take it from the tabl he
carri it with him into hi studi and there contempl it for a
while
that pernici girl is commun with godfrei he said to
himself which i particularli wish to prevent
a desir came upon him to know what wa in the letter and he began to
argu with himself as to hi dutythat wa the word he us final
he conclud that as godfrei wa still so young and so open to bad
influenc from that quarter thi duti clearli indic that he
should read the letter befor it wa forward in obedi to thi
high impuls he open and read it with the result that by the time it
wa finish there wa perhap no more angri clergyman in the british
empir the descript of himself look as though he had eaten a
hat of crabappl the impiou remark about the thirtynin
articl the suggest that godfrei instead of go to bed as he
had order him to do that even wa wander about london at
midnight the boldli announc intent of the writer of not go to
churchinde everi word of it irrit him beyond bear
well he said aloud i do not think that i am call upon to spend
twopencehalfpenni for isobel had forgotten the stamp in forward
such poison trash to a son whom i should guard from evil hate
girl at ani rate she shall have no answer to thi effus
then he put the letter into a drawer which he lock
as a consequ natur isobel did receiv no answer a fact
from which she drew her own conclus inde it would not be too
much to sai that these sear her soul she had written to godfrei she
had humbl herself befor godfrei and he sent herno answer it
never occur to her to make inquiri as to the fate of that letter
except onc when she ask the housemaid whom she chanc to meet
whether she had given it to mr parson the girl whose brain or
whatev repres that organ wa entir fix upon a young man in
the villag of whom she wa jealou answer ye perhap she had
entir forgotten the incid or perhap she consid the throw
of the letter upon a tabl as equival to deliveri
at ani rate isobel who thought like most other young peopl that
when thei onc have written someth it is convei by a magic
agenc to the addresse even if left between the leav of a blotter
accept the assur as conclus without doubt the letter had gone
and duli arriv onli godfrei did not choos to answer it that wa
all perhap thi might be becaus he wa still angri on account of the
knight in armouroh how she hope that thi wa the reason but as
her cold common sens of which she had an unusu share convinc
her much more probabl the explan wa that he wa engag
otherwis and did not think it worth while to take the troubl to
write
later on it is true she did mean to ask mr parson whether she had
forward the letter but as it chanc befor she did so that good
woman burst into a flood of convers about godfrei sai how
happi he seem to be in hi new home with such nice ladi around who
it wa plain thought so much of him and so forth thi garrul
isobel took as an intend hint and ceas from her contempl
queri when some month later mr knight brought her godfrei
epistl which announc hi inherit needless to sai everyth
becam plain as a pikestaff to her experienc intellig
so it came about that two young peopl who ador each other were
estrang for a consider length of time for isobel wrote no more
letter and the proud and outrag godfrei would rather have di than
attempt to open a correspondenceaft what he had seen in that london
squar it is true that in hi brief epistl home which were all
address to hi father sinc mr parson wa what is call a poor
scholar he did try in a roundabout wai to learn someth about
isobel but these inquiri for reason of hi own hi parent
complet ignor in short she might have been dead for all that
godfrei heard of her as he believ that she wa deadto him
meanwhil isobel had other thing to occupi her her mother as she
had said in the letter which mr knight sens of duti compel him
to steal becam veri ill with lung troubl the doctor announc that
she ought to be taken to egypt or some other warm climat such as
algeria for the winter month sir john would hear noth of the
sort for year past he had chosen to consid that hi wife wa
hypochondriac and all the medic opinion in london would not have
induc him to chang that view the fact wa as mai be guess that
it did not suit him to leav england and that for sundri reason which
need not be detail he did not wish that isobel should accompani her
mother to what he call foreign part in hi secret heart he
reflect that if ladi jane di well she di and while heaven
gain a saint earth or at ani rate sir john blake would be no
loser she had plai her part in hi life there wa noth more to
be made of her either as a woman as a social asset what would it
matter if on more pale uninterest ladi of titl join the
major
isobel had on of her stormi interview with sir john upon thi matter
of her mother health
she ought to go abroad she said
who told you that ask her father
the doctor i wait for them and ask them
then you had no busi to do so you ar an impertin and
interf chit
is it impertin and interf to be anxiou about on mother
health even if on is a chit inquir isobel look him straight
in the ey
then he broke out in hi coars wai sai thing to hi daughter of
which he should have been asham
she wait until he ceas redfac and gasp and repli
were it not for my mother whom you abus although she is such an
angel and ha alwai been so kind to you i would leav you father
and earn my own live or go with my uncl edgar to mexico where he
is to be appoint minist as he and aunt margaret ask me to as it
is i shall stop here though if anyth happen to mother becaus you
will not send her abroad i shall go if i have to run awai why wont
you let her go she ad with a chang of voic you need not come
i could look after her if you think that egypt or the other place is
too far you know the doctor sai that perhap switzerland would do her
good and that is quit near
he caught hold of thi suggest and exclaim with a sneer
i know why you want to go to switzerland miss to run after that
whippersnapp of a parson son eh well you shant and as for why
i wont let her go it becaus i dont believ those doctor who sai
on minut that she should go to egypt which is hot and the next to
switzerland which is cold moreov i mean you to stop in england
and not go fool about with a lot of strang men in these foreign
place you ar grown up now and out and i have my own plan for your
futur which cant come off if you ar awai we stop here till
christma and then go to london there that all so have done
at these insult especi that which had to do with godfrei isobel
turn perfectli scarlet and bit her lip till the blood ran then
without anoth word she went awai leav him if the truth were
known a littl frighten still he would not alter hi decis
partli becaus to do so must interfer with hi plan and he wa a
veri obstin man and partli becaus he refus to be beaten by
isobel thi wa he felt a trial of strength between them and if he
gave wai now she would be master hi wife welfar did not enter
into hi calcul
so thei stop in essex where matter went as the doctor had
foretold onli more quickli than thei expect ladi jane complaint
grew rapidli wors so rapidli that soon there wa no question of her
go abroad at the last moment sir john grew frighten as bulli
ar apt to do and on receipt of an indign letter from lord
lynfield now an old man who had been inform of the fact by hi
granddaught offer to send hi wife to egypt or anywher els
again the doctor were call in to report and told him with brutal
frank that if their advic had been taken when it wa first given
probabl she would have live for some year as it wa it wa
imposs for her to travel sinc the exert might caus her death
upon the journei especi if she becam seasick
thi verdict came to isobel knowledg as the first had done inde
in hi confus emphas by sever glass of port her father
blurt it out himself
i wonder whether you will ever be sorri wa her sole comment
then she sat down to watch her mother die and to think could there be
ani good god she wonder if he allow such thing to happen poor
girl it wa her first experi of the sort and as yet she did not
know what thing ar allow to happen in thi world in obedi to
the work of unalter law by whoever and for whatev purpos
these mai be decre
be ignor howev and still veri young and untaught of life she
could not be expect to take these larg view or to guess at the
hand of merci which hold the cup of human woe she saw her mother
fade awai becaus of her father obstinaci and selfseek and it
wa inconceiv to her that such an unnecessari thing could be
allow by a gentl and love provid therefor she turn her
back on provid as mani a strong soul ha done befor her
reject it for the reason that she could not understand
had she but guess thi attitud of her which could not be
conceal entir in the case of a natur so frank wa the bitterest
drop in her mother draught of death she poor gentl creatur made
no complaint but onli excus for her husband conduct nor save
for isobel sake did she desir to live her simpl faith upbor her
through the fear of departur and assur her of forgiv for all
error and of happi beyond in a land where there wa on at least
whom she wish to meet
i wont try to argu with you becaus i am not wise enough to
understand such thing she said to isobel but i wish dearest that
you would not be so certain as to matter which ar too high for us
i cant help it mother she answer
ladi jane look at her and smile and then said
no darl you cant help it now but i am sure that a time must
come when you will think differ i sai thi becaus someth
tell me that it is so and the knowledg make me veri happi you see
we must all of us go through dark and storm in life that is if we
ar worth anyth for of cours there ar peopl who do not feel
yet at the end there is light and love and peac for you as well as
for me isobel ye and for all of us who have tri to trust and to
repent of what we have done wrong
as you believ it i hope that it is true inde i think that it must
be true mother dear said isobel with a littl sob
the subject wa never discuss between them again but although isobel
show no outward chang of attitud from that time forward till the
end her mother seem much easier in her mind about her and her view
it will all come right we shall meet again i know it i know it
were her last word
she di quit suddenli on the 27th of decemb the dai upon which sir
john had announc that thei were to move to london
as a matter of fact on of the survivor of thi trio wa to move much
further than to london name isobel herself it happen thu the
funer wa over the rel and the few friend who attend it had
depart to their room if thei were stop in the hous or
elsewher isobel and her father were left alon she confront him a
tall slim figur whose thick blond hair and pale face contrast
strikingli with her black dress enorm in shape for so sir john had
grown carminecolour shade to purl about the shave chin and lip
which were also of rather a curiou hue baldhead bold yet
shiftyei also clad in black with a band of crape like to that of a
victorian mute about hi shine tall hat he lean against the
florid marbl mantelpiec a huge obes blot upon it white thei
were a queer contrast as dissimilar perhap as two human be well
could be
for a while there wa silenc between them which he whose nerv were
not so young or strong as hi daughter wa the first to break
well she dead poor dear he said
ye answer isobel her pentup indign burst forth and
you kill her
then he too burst forth
damn you what do you mean you littl minx he ask why do you
sai i kill her becaus i did what i thought the best for all of us
no woman had a better husband as i am sure she acknowledg in heaven
todai
i dont know what mother think in heaven if there is on for her as
there ought to be but i do know what i think on earth remark the
burn isobel
and i know what i think also shout her enrag parent dash the
new crapecov hat on to the tabl in front of him and it is that
the further you and i ar apart from each other the better we ar
like to get on
i agre with you father
look here isobel you said that your uncl edgar who ha been
appoint minist to mexico offer to take you with him to be a
companion to hi daughter your cousin emili well you can go if you

the curs place and can get to harwich just as well from london
write and make the arrang for on year no more by that time
your temper mai have improv he ad with an ugli sneer
thank you father i will
he stare at her for a littl while she met hi gaze unflinchingli
and in the end it wa not her ey that drop then with a smother
exclam he stamp out of the room kick isobel littl terrier
out of the path with hi elephantin foot the poor beast of which she
wa veri fond limp to her whine for it wa much hurt she took it
in her arm and kiss it weep tear of wrath and piti
i wonder what godfrei would sai about the fifth command if he had
been here thi afternoon you poor thing she whisper to the
whimper dog which wa lick it hang leg there is no god if
there had been he would not have given me such a father or my mother
such a husband
then still carri the injur terrier she went out and glide
through the dark to her mother grave in the neighbour
churchyard the sexton had done their work and the raw brown earth
of the grave mix with bit of decai coffin and fragment of
perish human bone wa cover with hothous flower among these

card whereon wa written to my darl wife from her bereav
husband john blake
isobel lift the wreath from it place of honour and threw it over the
the churchyard wall then she wept and wept as though her heart would
break

he would write again when he had anyth to commun but that as
yet he had not made up hi mind as to hi futur and propos to stai
where he wa continu hi studi if hi father would allow him to

covet it greatli but reflect with a sigh that have spent so much
on other he could afford noth for himself for godfrei wa an
unselfish soul instead he bought a collar of swiss lace for mr

depict in variou old print beneath the black of thi hood and
abov the rigid line of the set mouth stare two promin and glow
ey in which the gaslight wa reflect thei remind godfrei of
those of a stalk cat in a dark room inde from the moment that he
caught sight of them he felt like the mous cower in a corner or

along the bough

needl roll across the tabl ever more quickli toward the magnet so
did the unwil godfrei gravit toward madam rienn and now

she made a movement of her big white hand with the result that
godfrei felt like a spring which had been suddenli releas next
instant still pursu by that gurgl laughter he wa run hard
toward the dilig
fortun the pasteur wa so full of talk about the hous and hi
busi with the notari that there wa no need for godfrei to speak
in the coach or inde at dinner then after the meal wa finish he
produc hi present and with blush and stammer offer them to
the variou member of the famili what raptur there wa madam wa
delight with her necklac which she said and truli wa in the best
of tast juliett kiss the watch and look as though she would
like to kiss the donor as inde wa her case the pasteur examin
the fine pipe through hi blue spectacl sai that never had he
expect to own on so beauti then at onc fill it and began to
smoke after thi thei all scold him for hi extravag
you did not bui anyth for yourself said juliett reproachfulli
oh ye i see you did and she pretend to perceiv for the first
time the littl red case contain the ring which inadvert he
had pull out of hi pocket with the other articl although in truth
she had observ it from the begin let us learn what it is she
went on possess herself of and open the case oh a ring what
a pretti ring with two heart for whom is the ring monsieur godfrei
someon in england
then godfrei overcom told a lie
no for myself he said
juliett look at him and exclaim
then you should have told the jewel to make it big enough try and
you will see
he turn red as a boil lobster mademoisel stood opposit to him
shake her pretti head and murmur quel mensong quel bte
mensong while madam broke into a low and melodi laughter and
as she laugh look first at the ring and then at juliett shape
hand
make not a mock of our young friend said the pasteur suddenli
lift hi glanc or rather hi spectacl from a long contempl
of that nobl pipe and becom awar of what wa pass we all have
our present which ar magnific what then is our affair with the
ring pardon them and put it in your pocket godfrei and come let us
go to the observatori for the night is fine and by now the stove will
be warm
so thei went and soon were engag in contempl of the star an
occup which absorb godfrei so much that for a while he forgot
all hi troubl
when the door had shut behind them madam look at juliett who with
her new watch held to her ear observ her out of the corner of her
ey
i find him charm said madam present
ye mamma repli juliett so bright and even the tick is
music
stupid exclaim madam when i wa your agewel
pardon said juliett open her ey innoc
child i meant our young english friend i repeat that i find him
charm
of cours mammaaft that necklac
and youafter that watch
oh well enough though too grave perhap and fond of what is far
offi mean star she ad hurriedli
star pish it is but becaus there is noth nearer at hi
agestarswel of a sort perhap
she paus while juliett still look provokingli innoc so her
mother took a long step forward for in truth she grew impati with
all thi obtus in which for reason of her own she did not
believ
if i were a girl of your ag muse madam as though to herself i
do not think that ring would go to england
how mamma would you steal it
no but i would make sure that it wa given to me
now juliett could no longer feign not to understand she said noth
but turn as red as godfrei had done a littl while befor and stood
wait
i find him charm repeat madam though he is so young which
is a fault that will mend and she fix her ey upon her daughter
face with a look of interrog
then juliett gave a littl sigh and answer
good if you will make me sai it so do i also at least sometim i
think so when he is not dull and turn she fled from the room
madam smile as the door close behind her
that goe well and should go better she said to herself onli for
whom is the ring there must be some girl in england although of her
he sai noth pest there ar so mani girl still she is far
awai and thi on is near but it could be wish that she were more
experienc for then sinc she like him well enough all would be
sure what doe a man count in such a caseespeci when he is so
young pish noth at all and madam snap her finger at the
empti air it is the woman who hold the card if onli she know how
to plai them
now all these thing happen on a wednesdai when godfrei went to bed
that night uncomfort memori of madam rienn and of the chast
embrac which she had forc him to impress upon her expans
forehead haunt him for a while also fear for the futur howev
sundai wa still a long wai off so he went to sleep and dream that
he wa bui present at everi shop in lucern and give them all to
madam rienn
on thursdai he wa quit happi on fridai he began to suffer from
uneasi which on saturdai becam veri pronounc it seem to him
that alreadi wave of influenc were creep toward him like the
fring of some miasmic mist doubtless it wa imagin but he
could feel their first frail tentacl wrap themselv around hi
will and draw him toward lucern as the dai went on the tentacl
grew stronger till by even there might have been a veri octopu
behind them if thi were so that night he wonder what would happen
on the follow dai when the octopu began to pull on on point he
wa determin he would not go never would he allow madam rienn to
put him to sleep again and what wa much wors to make him kiss her
at ani rate that spirit eleanor wa beauti and attractivebut
madam rienn rather than forgath with her again in thi
affection manner much as he dread itor herh would have
compound with the ghost call eleanor
now although like most young peopl godfrei wa indol and evas
of difficulti fear of face troubl also he had a bedrock of
charact there were point beyond which he would not go even for the
sake of peac but here a troubl came in he wa well awar that
although he would not goto madam rienn to witther wa someth
stronger than himself which would make him go it wa the old stori
over again set out by st paul onc and for ever that of the two law
which make a shuttlecock of man so that he must do what he will not
have onc given wai to madam rienn who wa to him a kind of sin
incarn he had becom her servant and if she wish to put him to
sleep or to do anyth els with him well howev much he hate it
he must obei
the thought terrifi him what could he do he had tri prayer
never befor had he prai so hard in all hi life but thei did not
seem to be of the slightest us no guardian angel not even eleanor
appear to protect him from madam rienn and meanwhil the fog wa
creep on and the octopu tentacl were grip tighter in hi
emerg there rose the counten of miss ogilvi dy counsel
welcom and unexpect as light of the moon to a lost travel on a
cloudcloth night what had she told him to do to resist madam
rienn he had tri that with lament result to invok the help
of religion he had tri that with strictli neg result the
power abov did not seem inclin to interven in thi privat affair
to appeal to the pasteur that he had not tri but unpromis as the
ventur seem to be by jove he would in hi immin peril there
wa noth to which he would have appeal even mumbojumbo itself if
it gave him the slightest hope of protect from madam rienn
accordingli when thei went to the observatori that night instead of
appli hi ey to the telescop in the accustom fashion godfrei
rush at the busi like a bull at a gate at first the pasteur wa
entir confus especi as godfrei spoke in english which the
preceptor must translat into french in hi own mind by degre
howev he becam extraordinarili interest so much so that he let
the new pipe go out and what wa veri rare with him except in the
most move passag of hi own sermon push the blue spectacl
from hi high nose upward till thei caught upon the patch of grizzl
hair which remain upon hi bald head
ah he said answer in french which by now godfrei understood
fairli well thi is truli excit at last i come in touch with the
thing know godfrei that you furnish me with a great occas long
have i studi thi what you call itdemonolog of it i know much
though not from actual touch therewith
then he began to talk of gnostic and witchcraft and incubi and
succubi and the develop of modern spiritu till godfrei
wa quit bewild at length he paus relit the new pipe and said
these matter we will studi afterward thei ar i assur you most
entertain meanwhil we have to deal with your madam rienn all
right oh quit all right i will be her match she will not make me
kiss her no not at all not at all be tranquil young friend if
tomorrow you feel the impuls to go go you shall but i will go with
you then we will see now to bed and sleep well for me i must studi
i have mani book on thi subject and there ar point whereon i would
refresh myself be not afraid i know much of madam rienn and i will
leav her flat as that and with surpris alacr he jump on a
larg black beetl which unhappili for itself just then ran across
the observatori floor to enjoi the warmth of the stove wait he
ad as godfrei wa leav first kneel down i have memori of the
ancient prayer or if i forget bit i can fill in the hole
godfrei obei in a rather abject fashion whereon the old pasteur
wave the pipe abov hi head from which emerg line of blue smoke
such as might have been accessori to an incant repeat over him
someth in latin that ow to the foreign accent he could not in
the least understand it end howev with the sign of the cross
made with the bowl of the pipe which the pasteur forgot still remain
in hi hand
fortifi by the access of thi new alli godfrei slept fairli well
till within a littl while of dawn when he wa awaken by a sound of
rap at first he thought that these rap which seem veri loud
and distinct were made by someon knock on the door perhap to
tell him there wa a fire and faintli murmur entrez then to hi
horror he becam awar that thei proceed not from the door but from
the back of hi wooden bedstead immedi abov him and at the same
time recollect that he had heard similar nois while sit at the
littl tabl in the villa ogilvi which the mystic gather there
declar were produc by spirit
hi hair rose upon hi head a cold perspir trickl down him he
shook in everi limb he thought of light a candl but reflect
that it wa on the chest of drawer at the other side of the room also
that he did not know where he had put the match he thought of fly
to the pasteur but rememb that to do so first he must get out of
bed and perhap expos hi bare leg to the assault of ghostli hand
and next that to reach the chamber of monsieur and madam boiset he
must pass through the sanctuari of the room occupi by juliett so he
compromis by retir under the cloth much as a tortois draw it
head into it shell
thi expedi prove quit useless for there beneath the blanket the
rap sound louder than ever moreov of a sudden the bed seem to
be fill with a cold and unnatur air which blew all about him
especi upon hi hand though he tri to protect these by place
them under hi back now godfrei knew someth of the inadequ and
clumsi method affect by alleg commun spirit and half
automat began to repeat the alphabet when he got to the letter
i there wa a loud rap he began again and at a came anoth rap
onc more he tri for someth seem to make him do so and wa
stop at m
i am he murmur and recommenc until the word here wa spelt
out after which came three rapid rap to signifi a full stop
who is here he ask in hi own mind at the same time determin
that he would leav it at that it wa of no us at all for the other
parti evid intend to go on
there wa a perfect rain of rap on the bed off the bed on the
floor even on the jug by the washstand inde he thought that thi
and other articl were be move about the room to stop thi
multiform assault onc more he took refug in the alphabet with the
result that the rap unmistak spelt the word eleanor
great heaven he thought to himself that dread spirit girl
here in my bedroom how can she it is most improp but i dont
suppos she care a sou for that
in hi despair and alarm he tuck the cloth tightli round him and
thrust out hi head said in trembl accent
pleas go awai you know i never ask you to come and realli it
isnt right remark which he thought though like all the rest thi
mai have been fanci were follow by a sound of ghostli laughter what
wa more the bedcloth suddenli slip off him oroh horror
perhap thei were pull off at ani rate thei went and when next he
saw them thei were ly in a heap by the side of the bed
then it would seem that he faint overcom by these terror real or
imaginari at ani rate when he open hi ey again it wa to see the
daylight creep into the room never befor had he appreci so
thoroughli the beauti of the dawn and to find himself ly half
frozen on the bed with the pillow which he wa clasp
affection for hi sole cover
at breakfast that morn he look so peculiar and dilapid that
madam and juliett made tender inquiri as to hi health to which he
repli that hi bedcloth had come off in the night and the cold had
given him a chill in the middl thei were veri sympathet and
dose him with hot cafaulait but the pasteur studi him
through the blue spectacl said ah is it so in a kind of
triumphant tone which madam design as bte inde to those
unacquaint with what wa pass in m boiset mind it must have
seem particularli stupid
when breakfast wa over he possess himself of godfrei and led him to
the observatori where the stove wa alreadi lit though thi wa not
usual in the daytim especi on sundai
now my boi tell me all about it he said and godfrei told him
feebli suggest that it might have been a nightmar
nightmar nonsens the witch rienn ha sent her demon to torment
you that is all i thought she would it is quit accord to rule a
most clear and excel case inde i am a lucki student
i dont believ in witch said godfrei i alwai heard thei were
rubbish
ah i dont know here in the mountain these swiss peopl believ in
them and tell strang stori some of which i have heard as their
pasteur especi when i held offic among the high alp also the
bibl speak of them often doe it not and what wa is and shall
be as solomon sai oh why hesit without doubt thi woman is a
witch who pose as an innoc modern spiritualist but she shall not
send her pretti femal devil after you again for i will make that room
imposs to her
pleas do said godfrei and as for madam rienn it is certainli
strang that she should have known about the thing i had in my pocket
the other dai although of cours she mai have follow me into the
shop
ye ye she follow you into the shop she or her demon though
perhap you would not see her there what did you tell me that in the
villa you thought that the dead mademoisel wa warn you against
someth well perhap she wa for she wa a good woman though weak
and foolish to trust to spiritu and now without doubt she see
all and would protect you of whom she is fond
then i wish she had done it a littl better said godfrei oh
listen there a rap
a rap there wa certainli on the hot iron of the stove a reson
ring rap the pasteur advanc and made an examin and while he
wa do so there came anoth what is more in a most inexplic
fashion hi blue spectacl flew from hi nose veri solemnli he found
and replac them and then with the utmost digniti address himself
to the stove he curs and exorcis that articl of domest
furnitur in hi best mediv latin appar the effort wa
success for there were no more manifest
listen my boi you do not part from me thi dai present we go to
church and you sit under me where i can keep my ey on you if you
make on movement toward the door i descend from the desk or the
pulpit and take you back there with me
i dont want to move said godfrei
no but there ar other who mai want to move you then after church
we dine and after dinner we take a nice walk through the wood arm in
arm ye perhap we go as far as lucern and pai a littl visit there
sinc thi afternoon i have arrang that there is no servic
so godfrei went to church and sat under the cold blue glare of the
pasteur spectacl listen to a realli eloqu sermon for hi
preach wa excel he took hi text from the stori of saul and
the witch of endor and after dwell on it and it moral open up
the whole problem of the hidden influenc which mai and probabl do
affect the human soul he gave a short but learn account of the
histori of demonolog throughout the ag which evid he had at
hi finger end he distinguish between good and evil spirit and
while not deni the law of such research point out the
peril that the seeker ran sinc in hi quest for the good he might
find the evil final he demonstr that there wa a sure refug
from all such demoniac attack which those who suffer from them
had but to seek
madam doze dure thi sermon juliett wonder what had sent her
father down that road and the littl congreg those of them who
understood thought it a pleasant chang from hi usual discours upon
their sin sinc thei at least had never practis demonolog but to
godfrei to whom inde it wa address it brought much comfort
for in the pasteur and hi pure and beauti doctrin he saw a rock
on which he might stand secur defi madam rienn and eleanor and
all the host of hell behind them
then came dinner it wa toward the middl of thi meal that godfrei
began to feel veri ill at eas he fidget he look toward the
door he half rose and sat down again
do you perchanc wish to go out ask the pasteur who wa keep
him under constant observ
what of it if he doe interrupt madam did not monsieur godfrei
inform us that he wa unwel go then monsieur godfrei

and sickli smile upon hi face the pasteur swallow down hi vin
ordinair and rush after him

clergyman mon dieu there thei go the two of them walk
toward the wood what a strang idea and your father ha monsieur
godfrei by the arm although assuredli he is not faint for he pull

juliett shook her head and gave it up and so perforc did her mother
chapter ix
the pasteur conquer
meanwhil follow a short cut through the snowi wood that ran over
the shoulder of the interven hill the pair were wend their wai
toward lucern godfrei a fix and vacant look upon hi face went

third at such an affair ejacul an outspoken ladi who wa stand

an old part of the town with which neither of them wa acquaint till
at length godfrei dive beneath an archwai pull up in front of an
antiqu doorwai sai

look at the write and make sure said the pasteur for it seem
ridicul
at that moment the door open mysteri and godfrei disappear
into the passag beyond scarc had the pasteur time to follow him
when it shut again although he could see no concierg
doubtless it is on of those that work with a wire he thought to
himself but he had no time to stop to look for alreadi godfrei wa
climb the stair up he went three floor and up after him
scrambl the pasteur suddenli godfrei stop at a door and not
wait to ring the bell knock with hi hand immedi it open
and godfrei with hi companion pass into a veri dark hall round
which were sever other door here in the gloom the pasteur lost him

speak english with a veri foreign accent sai
so you have come to see your godmamma my dear littl clever boi
well i thought you would and last night i sent you a pretti messeng
to give you remembr
then the pasteur found the handl of the door and enter the room it
wa a curiou place drape not without tast of a bizarr kind in
vivid colour wherein purpl domin and it gave an idea of mingl
magnific and squalor some of the furnitur wa veri good as were
on or two of the pictur though all of it wa of an odd and unusu
make thu the sideboard wa shape like a sarcophagu and support
on solid sphinx with gild face in a corner of the room also stood
an unwrap mummi in a glass case
in the midst of all thi stood a common deal tabl whereon were a
black bottl and the remain of madam meal which seem to have
consist of larg suppli of underdon meat in front of the fire wa

couch wa seat madam clad in a kind of black dressinggown and a
wide gold scarf ti about her ampl waist her fat massiv face wa
paint and powder on her head she wore a kind of mantilla also

loud high voic and wave a larg umbrella which had come partli

her as he had done upon the beetl he toss up her mangl remain as
the holi bull api of the egyptian might have done with those of a
greek blasphem then like a triumphant pugilist metaphor he
stood over her and ask her if she want ani more

have express it she felt that he had the power on hi side
but madam wa no common charlatan she had strength of a sort though
where it came from who could sai moreov for all kind of secret
reason of her own she desir to keep in her grip thi boi godfrei
who had shown himself to be so wonder a medium or clairvoy to
her he meant strength and fortun also for him she had conceiv some
kind of unholi like in the recess of her dark soul therefor she
wa not prepar to give him up without a struggl
present madam seem to cast off the influenc with which the
pasteur had overwhelm her while hi maledict were in full flow
she sank in a huddl heap upon the couch of a sudden she reviv she
sprang up notwithstand her bulk she leapt into the air like a
balletdanc she tore the golden mantilla from her head let down
a flood of raven hair streak with grei and wave it round her she
call upon the name of spirit or demon long resound name with
an eastern ring about them to come to her aid then she pranc into
the centr of the room cry

as she spoke the fear godfrei in hi corner saw the door of the
glass case fly open also as he thought probabl erron that he
saw the mummi move lift it stiff leg and champ it iron jaw
so that the yellow ancient teeth caught the light as thei move then
he heard and saw someth els suddenli the pasteur in tone that
rang like a trumpet cri out

with a singl bound he wa in front of the case with the hook of hi
big umbrella he caught the shrivel thing round the neck with hi
long thin arm he grip it about the middl just like somebodi

pull out flew the agewith corps the head came off the bodi
broke abov the hip and fell upon the floor leav the leg stand
in the case a ghastli spectacl on to thi sever trunk the pasteur
leapt again as he had done upon the black beetl it crunch and

madam rienn utter a stifl scream more she could not do for rage
choke her her big ey roll she clench and unclench her hand
and bent forward as though she were about to fly at the pasteur like a

point of the umbrella to receiv the charg as it came and take
advantag of madam temporari paralysi of speech went on

then she gave in
come here she said sullenli to godfrei still speak in french
he came and stood befor her sneez for the pungent dust of the
smash mummi which the pasteur still ground beneath hi larg boot
had float up hi nose
ceas that nois littl fool and look at me
godfrei obei but did not stop sneez becaus the mixtur of
spice and organ matter would not allow him to do so she stare at
him veri evilli mutter some more word and made mystic upward
pass with her hand
there now she said you ar free so far as i am concern but i
do not think that you ar done with spirit sinc thei ar guest

air lucern is cold in the winter especi for those whose heart
ar not too strong is it finish
quit for my part but for you interf humbug i do not know
get out of my room both of you
the pasteur bow with an oldfashion polit and herd godfrei
in front of him turn to go as he pass through the door someth
hard hit him violent in the back so that he nearli fell it wa the
head of the mummi which madam had hurl at him it fell to the
floor and strike against a chair leg recoil through the doorwai
godfrei saw it and an impuls seiz him lift that head he
turn madam wa stand in the middl of the room with her back to
the deal tabl utter short littl howl of furi
godfrei advanc veri polit and sai i believ thi is your
properti madam place the batter remnant of human upon the
tabl besid the black bottl as he did so he glanc at the
mesmerist then turn and fled for her face wa like to that of a
devil
monsieur boiset he said when thei reach the street someth
ha happen to me i am quit chang not for all the world would i
go near madam rienn again inde now i feel as though i wish to
run awai from her
that is good said the pasteur oh i thought it would be so for i
know how to deal with such witch but not too fast not too fast my
godfrei i wonder what the old egyptian put into the head of their
mummi to make them so heavi
bitumen answer godfrei and proceed in a cheer voic to give
an account of the egyptian process of mummif to hi tutor which
isobel and he had acquir in the cours of their miscellan read
at monk acr inde as he had said whatev the reason he wa
chang and prepar to talk cheerfulli about anyth a great burden
wa lift from hi soul
from that dai forward godfrei becam what a youth of hi year and race
should be a highspirit athlet and activ young man madam
rienn and her vision pass from him like a bad dream thought he
remain alwai for that wa hi natur sometim sad also when he
thought of isobel who seem to have disappear quit out of hi
life but as wa natur at hi ag thi mood weaken by degre she
wa alwai there in the background but she ceas to obscur the
landscap as she had done befor and wa to do in hi after life had
she been a girl of the common type attract onli becaus she wa a
young and vivaci woman doubtless the eclips would have been
complet occasion inde men do love fool in an endur
fashion which is perhap the most evil fate that can be laid upon
them for what can be wors than to wast what is deep and real upon a
thing of flesh without a soul an empti paint bubbl which evad
the hand or burst if it is grasp those ar the real unfortun
who have sold themselv for a mess of potag that for the most part
thei ar never even allow to eat sinc befor the bell ring it ha
probabl been deposit by heaven know what hand of circumst in
someon els plate or gone stale and been thrown awai
godfrei wa not on of these becaus the hand of circumst had
manag hi affair otherwis isobel wa no mess of potag but with
all her fault and fail a fair and great inherit for him who
could take seisin of her still as he believ she had first treat
him badli then utterli neglect him whose pride she had outrag by
not even take the troubl to write him a letter and final had
vanish awai and he wa young with manhood advanc in hi vein
like the puls of spring and women ar mani in the world some of whom
have pretti face and proper figur also although the fact is
overlook by convent it ha pleas natur to make man polygam
in hi instinct though where those instinct end and what is call
love begin is a thing almost imposs to defin probabl in truth
the limit li beyond the border of sex
so isobel grei ey fade into the background of godfrei mental
vision while the violet ey of juliett drew ever nearer to hi
physic percept and here to save troubl it mai be said at
onc that he never care in the least for juliett except as a male
creatur care for a pretti femal creatur and that juliett never
care in the least for him except as a young woman care in gener
for a handsom and attract young manwith prospect inde she
found him too seriou for her tast she did not understand him as
for hi part in her he found noth to understand
after all rule out the primari impuls which would make a sculleri
maid congeni to a geniu upon a desert isl what wa there in a
juliett to appeal to a godfrei and with the same qualif what
wa there in a godfrei to appeal to a juliett as onc with an
accident touch of poetri she said to her mother when at hi side
she felt as though she were walk over a snowcov crevass in the
surround alp all seem firm beneath her feet but she never knew
when the crust would break and he would vanish into unfathom depth
perchanc drag her with him or feel her danger she might run
from him on to safer ground where she knew herself to be on good
common rock or soil and no strang hollow echo struck her ear
leav him to pursu hi peril journei alon
her mother laugh and fall into her humour answer that beyond
the crevass and at the foot of the further slope lai the warm and
merri human town the best hous of whichnot unlik the villa
ogilvycould be reach in no other wai and that with such a home
wait to receiv her it wa worth while to take a littl risk
thereon juliett shrug her white shoulder and in the interv of
on of the french chansonett which she wa veri fond of warbl in
her gai voic remark that she prefer to make journei safe or
peril in the compani of a singingbird in the sunlight rather than
in that of an owl in the dusk who alwai remind her of the advanc
dark
at least that wa the substanc of what she said although she did not
put it quit so neatli then as though by an afterthought she ask
when her cousin jule a young notari of bern wa come to stai with
them
the winter wore awai the spring came and after spring summer with
it greeneri and flower godfrei wa happi enough dure thi time to
begin with the place suit him he wa veri well now and grew
enorm in that pure and trenchant air broaden as well as
lengthen till notwithstand hi slim he gave promis of
becom a larg athlet man
madam rienn too and her unholi terror had fade into the
background he no longer thought of spirit although it is true that
a sens of the imman and realiti of the unseen wa alwai with him
inde as time went on it increas rather than lessen partli
thi wa ow to the charact and natur tendenc of hi mind
partli also without doubt to the fact that hi recent experi
had as it were open a door to him between the seen and the hidden
or rather burst a breach in the divid wall that never wa built up
again also hi astronom studi certainli gave an impetu to
thought and specul such as were alwai present with him onli
now these were of a wholesom and rever natur tend toward
those end which ar advanc by religion in it truest sens
he work hard too under the gentl guidanc of the learn pasteur
at the classic literatur and other subject while in french he
could not fail to becom profici in the compani of the talk
madam and the sprightli juliett nor did he want for relax
there were great wood on the hill behind the maison blanch and in
these he obtain leav to shoot rabbit and horribl to sai fox
juliett and he would set out togeth toward even accompani by
a clever cur which belong to jean the factotum of the hous
thei would post themselv at some conveni spot while the
instruct hound rang the wood abov then would appear perhap a
rabbit perhap a hare though these in that land of poach were not
common or occasion a great red stealthi fox at first with hi
english tradit godfrei shrank from shoot the last which he had
been taught ought to die in on wai onli name by be torn to
piec in the jaw of the hound
juliett howev mock at him volubl recit reynard mani
misdeedshow he stole chicken how he tore out the throat of lamb
and accord to local report wa not even abov kill a babi if he
found that innoc alon so it came about next time the excit
yap of the curdog wa heard on the slope abov them follow by
stealthi movement among the fallen pine needl and at length by the
appear of the beauti red creatur slyli slink awai to
shelter not twenti yard from where thei stood behind a treetrunk
that juliett whisper
tirez tirez and he lift the gun an oldfashion
singlebarrel piec aim and fire
then follow a horrid scene the big shot with which he had load
mortal wound but did not kill the fox that with it forepaw
broken roll and bit and made dread nois in it agoni it
beauti fur all stain with blood godfrei did not know what to do
it wa too big and strong to kill with juliett littl stick so he
tri to batter it to death with the stock of the gun but without
success and at last withdrew look at it horrifi
what shall i do he ask faintli of juliett
load the gun and shoot it again repli that practic young woman
so with some mistak for the emerg made him nervou such as the
drop of the cap among the pine needl he obei at last the poor
beast lai dead a veri disagre spectacl with the curdog that
had arriv bite joyous at it quiver form
godfrei put down the gun and retir behind a tree whenc present he
emerg look veri pale for to tell the truth he had been ill
i do not think i like shoot fox he said
how strang you ar answer juliett quit unlik other men now
my cousin jule there is noth that he love better go now and cut
off hi tail to hang upon the wall it is beauti
i cant said godfrei still more faintli
then give me the knife for i can
and she did
had madam but known it that fox did not die unaveng upon her
famili for with it depart from the world all hope of the allianc
which she desir so earnestli
chapter x
godfrei becom a hero
the truth is that godfrei wa no true sportsman realli he did not
enjoi extermin other and kindr life to promot hi own
amus like most young men he wa delight if he made a good
shot moreov he had some aptitud for shoot but unlik most
young men to him afterward came reflect who gave him the right
to kill creatur as sentient and much more beauti in their wai
then himself just becaus it wa great fun of cours he wa
familiar with the common answer that dai by dai hi bodi wa nourish
upon the flesh of other anim destroi for that purpos but then
thi wa a matter of necess so arrang by a law that person
he thought dread but over which he had no manner of control it wa
part of the hellish system of a world built upon the foundat stone
of death
natur told him that he must live and that to live not be a
vegetarian which for most of us is difficult in a cold climat he
must kill or allow other to kill for him but to hi fanci perhap
meticul between such need slaughter and that carri out for hi
own amus and not realli for the purpos of obtain food there
seem to be a great gulf fix to get food he would have kill
anyth and inde often did in later dai as he would and also
often did in after dai have destroi noxiou anim such as tiger
but to inflict death mere to show hi own skill or to gratifi man
innat passion for hunt which descend to him from a more primit
period well that wa anoth matter it is true that he wa not
logic sinc alwai he remain an ardent fisherman partli becaus
he had convinc himself from variou observ that fish feel veri
littl and partli for the reason that there is high author for
fish although be it admit with a singl except alwai in
connect with the obtain of need food
in these conclus godfrei wa strengthen by two circumst
first hi read especi of buddhist literatur that enjoin
them so strongli and in which he found a great deal to admir and
secondli by the entir concurr of the pasteur boiset whom he
admir even more than he did buddhist literatur
i am delight my young friend said the pasteur beam at him
through the blue spectacl to find someon who agre with me
person although you might not believ it i love the chase with
ardour when i wa young i have shot as mani as
twentyfivenotwentyseven blackbird and thrush in on dai to
sai noth of thirtyon lark and some other small game also onc
i wound a chamoi which a bold hunter with me kill it wa a
gloriou moment but now for the reason that you mention i have
given up all thi sport which formerli to me wa so great an
excit and relax yet i admit that i still fish onli last
year i caught a larg hat of perch and dace of which i persuad
madam to cook some that juliett would not eat and gave to the cat
onc too there wa a big trout in the lake lucern he broke my line
but my boi we will go to fish for that trout no doubt he is still
there for though i wa then young these fishi creatur live for mani
year and to catch him would be a glori
after godfrei had given up hi foxshoot not becaus in itself is a
terribl crime like fish for salmon with her roe but for
reason which most of hi countrymen would consid effemin and
absurd he took to make expedit still in compani with juliett
for madam stretch continent convent in hi case in search of
certain rare flower which grew upon the lower slope of these alp in
connect with on of these flower an incid occur rather
absurd in itself but which wa not without effect upon hi fortun
the search for a certain floral treasur wa long and arduou
if onli i could find that love white bloom exclaim juliett in
exasper at the close of a weari hour of climb why i would
kiss it
so would i said godfrei mop himself with a pocket handkerchief
for the sun wa hot and with pleasur
hidden flower invok juliett with appropri heroic gestur
white secret maiden flower hear us discov thyself o shrink
flower and thou shalt be kiss by the on that first find thee
i dont know that the flower would care for that remark godfrei
as thei renew their quest
at length behind a jut mass of rock in a miniatur vallei not
more than a few yard wide that wa back by other rock thi flower
wa found godfrei and juliett pass round either side of the
black project mass to the open of the toi vale beyond
discov it simultan there it stood on love lilylik
bloom grow alon virgin perfect with a cry of delight thei
sprang at it and pluck it from it root both of them grasp the
tall stem
i saw it first and i will kiss it cri juliett in token of
possess
no said godfrei i did and i will i want that flower for my
collect
so do i for mine answer juliett
then thei both tri to set thi seal of possess upon that lili
bloom with the strang result that their young lip met through it
fragil substanc and with so much energi that it wa crush and
ruin
oh said godfrei with a start look what you have done to the
flower
i i wick on well for the matter of that look what you have
done to my lip thei feel quit bruis
then first she laugh and next look as though she were go to cry
dont be sad said godfrei remorsefulli no doubt we shall find
anoth now that we know where thei ar
perhap she answer but it is alwai the first that on
rememb and it is finish and she threw down the stalk and
stamp on it
just then thei heard a sound of laughter and look up to their
horror perceiv that thei were not alon for there seat upon
stone at the end of the tini vallei in compos and comfort
attitud which suggest that thei had not arriv that moment were
two gentlemen who appear to be highli amus
godfrei knew them at onc although he had not seen them sinc the
previou autumn thei were brother josiah smith the spiritualist and
professor petersen the investig dane whom he us to meet at the
sanc in the villa ogilvi
i guess young brother knight said the former hi ey sparkl
with sarcast merriment that there is no paint on you when you find
a flower you know how to turn it to the best possibl us
the substanc of flower is fragil especi if of the lili tribe
and imped noth remark the learn dane in consid tone
though what he meant godfrei did not understand at the moment on
consider he understood well enough
our mutual friend madam rienn who is absent in itali will be
greatli amus when she hear of thi episod said brother smith
she is inde a remark woman for onli thi morn i receiv a
letter in which she inform me that veri soon i should meet you young
man under peculiar circumst how peculiar she did not add well
i congratul you and the young ladi i assur you you made quit a
pretti pictur with noth but that flower between you though i
admit it wa rough on the flower if i rememb right you ar fond of
the classic as i am and will recal to mind a greek poet name
theocritu i think had he been wander here in the alp todai he
would have like to write on of hi idyl about you two and that
flower
becaus of the interrupt give pardon for it is ow an apolog
said the solemn professor ad i think it must have been the
eman of madam rienn herself which led us to thi place where
we did not at all mean to come for she is veri anxiou to know how you
progress and what you ar do
ye young friend broke in brother smith not without a touch of
malic for like the rest he wa resent of godfrei desert of
their circl and now we shall be abl to tell her
sai then said juliett who ar these gentlemen and of what do
thei talk
theyarefriend of mine godfrei began to explain with awkward
hesit but she cut him short with
i like not your friend thei make a mock of me and i will never
forgiv you
but juliett i he began and got no further for she turn and
ran awai anxiou to explain he ran after her pursu by the loud
hilar of the intrud pair in vain for juliett wa singularli
swift of foot and he might as well have pursu atalanta
she reach the maison blanch which fortun wa empti a clear
ten yard ahead of him and shut herself in her room whenc declar
that she had a headach she did not emerg till the follow morn
godfrei depart to the observatori where he often work in summer
feel veri sore and full of reflect he had not realli meant to
kiss juliett at least he thought not and it wa unthink that she
meant to kiss him sinc so far as he wa awar no young woman ever
want to do such a thing be everi on of them doubtless as
unapproach and frigid as the topmost snowi peak of the alp such
wa and alwai remain hi attitud where the other sex wa
concern on not without inconveni in a practic world of
disillus no it wa that confound flower which brought about
thi pure accidenta though natur which design such accid had
not alwai a flower or someth equal servic up her sleev
moreov had it not been for that accurs pair sent doubtless to
spy on him by madam rienn the accid would never have matter
at least not much he could have apolog suitabl to juliett that
is if she want an apolog which she show no sign of do until
she saw the two men inde at the moment he thought that she seem
rather amus
he thought of search out brother smith and professor petersen and
explain to them exactli what had happen in full detail and should
thei still continu their ribald jest of punch their head which
as a manli young fellow he wa quit capabl of do reflect
show him howev that thi cours might not be wise sinc such
adventur ar apt to end in the policecourt where the flower and
it fruit would obtain undu public no he must leav the busi
alon and trust that juliett would be merci suppos that she
were to tell madam that he had tri to kiss her though probabl she
would not mention that he had actual succeed
the mere idea made him feel cold down the back he felt sure that
madam would believ the worst of him to judg from their
convers ladi good as thei all were invari did seem to
believ the worst in such affair should he throw himself upon the
merci of the pasteur again no it would be so hard to make him
comprehend also if he did he might suggest that the altar wa the
onli possibl expiat andand oh he must confess it she wa veri
nice and sweet but he did not wish to marri juliett and live with
her all hi life
no there wa but on thing to be done keep the burden of hi secret
lock in hi own breast though unfortun it wa lock as well
in those of juliett and of two uninvit observ and probabl would
soon also be lock in the capaci bosom of madam rienn for the
rest toward juliett in the futur he would observ an attitud of
strictest proprieti never more should she have occas to complain of
hi conduct which henceforth would be immacul ala how easi it is
for the most innoc to be misjudg and appar not without
reason
thi reflect brought someth to godfrei mind which had escap
it in hi first disturb also connect with a flower there came
befor him the vision of a london squar and of a tall pale girl in
an antiqu dress give a rose to a man in knight armour which rose
both of them kiss simultan of cours when he saw it he had
rule out the rose and onli thought of the kiss although now that
he came to think of it a rose is of a much thicker textur than a
lili as he had wit that littl scene and drawn hi own
conclus so other had wit anoth littl scene that
afternoon and made therefrom deduct which in hi innoc soul
he knew to be total fals suppos then that hi deduct were
also fals oh it wa not possibl besid a barrier built of rose
leav wa not suffici which again with perfect justic he
rememb wa exactli what brother smith and professor petersen had
thought of on compos of lili petal
there for the time the matter end juliett reappear on the morrow
quit cure of her headach and as gai and charm as ever possibl
she had confid in her mamma who had told her that after all thing
were not so terribl even if thei had been seen
at ani rate the equilibrium wa restor godfrei act on hi solemn
resolut of haughti and detach for quit an hour after
which juliett threw a kitten at him and ask what wa the matter and
then sang him on of her pretti chansonett to the accompani of
a guitar with three string which close the incid still there
were no more flower hunt and no new adventur tacitli but
complet everyth of the sort wa drop out of their
relationship thei remain excel friend on affection term
inde but that wa all
meanwhil ow to hi doubt aris out of a singular coincid
concern with flower and kiss godfrei gradual made up hi mind
to write to isobel inde he had half compos the epistl when at
the end of on of hi brief letter hi father inform him that she
had gone to mexico with her uncl so it came about that it wa never
post sinc it is a kind of superstit with young peopl that
letter can onli be deliv at the place where the addresse last
resid it rare occur to them that these mai be forward and
ultim arriv nor inde did it occur to godfrei that as
isobel uncl wa the british minist to a certain countri an
envelop address to her in hi care in that countri probabl would
have reach her
she wa gone and there wa an end it wa of no us to think more of
the matter still he wa sorri becaus in that same letter hi father
had allud casual to the death of ladi jane which had caus hawk
hall to be shut up for a while and he would have like to condol with
isobel on her loss he knew that she love her mother dearli and of
thi gentl ladi he himself had veri affection remembr sinc
she had alwai been most kind to him yet for the reason state he
never did so
about a fortnight after the flower episod a chanc came godfrei wai
of make an alpclimb expedit in the compani of some
mountain thei were friend of the pasteur who join the parti
himself but stai in a villag at the foot of the mountain thei were
to climb sinc for such exercis he had lost the tast the first two
expedit went off veri successfulli godfrei show himself most
agil at the sport which suit hi adventur spirit and delight
him by natur notwithstand hi dreami characterist he wa
fearless at ani rate where hi person safeti wa concern and
have a good head it gave him pleasur to creep along the edg of
precipic or up slipperi ic slope cut nich with an ax for
hi feet
then came the third attempt up a realli difficult peak which had not
yet been conquer that year the detail of the expedit do not
matter but the end of it wa that at a particularli peril place on
of the parti lost hi head or hi breath and roll from the path
there he lai half senseless on the brink of a gulf with a drop of a
thousand feet or more beneath him as it happen thei were climb
in lot of three each of which lot wa rope togeth but at some
distanc between the parti that with the guid be a good wai
ahead
godfrei wa lead hi parti along the track made by the other but
their progress wa not veri rapid ow to the weak of the man who
had fallen who as it afterward transpir suffer from hi heart
and wa affect by the altitud the climber behind godfrei wa strong
and bold also as it chanc at the moment of the fall thi man
feet were plant upon a lump of project rock so firmli that by
throw himself forward against the snow slope grasp anoth lump
of rock with hi left hand and bear on to the alpenstock with hi
right he wa abl to sustain the weight of their companion but the
rope which bound them togeth though strong wa thin moreov at
the point where most of the strain came it rest on a knifelik edg
of ic so sharp that there wa momentarili danger of it frai
through as the movement of the weight beneath rub it against the
edg
when a shout and the stoppag warn godfrei of what had happen he
turn round and studi the posit even to hi inexperienc ey it
wa obviou that a catastroph wa immin now there were two thing
which might be done on wa to stai in hi place and help to bear the
strain of the swing bodi for almost immedi the faint man
slip from the ledg and hung abov the gulf the other wa to trust
to number two to hold hi weight and go to hi assist in the hope
of be abl to support him until the guid could return to the first
parti as by a flashlik work of the mind godfrei weigh these
altern hi quick ey saw what look like a littl bit of fluff
appear from the undersid of the rope which told him that on at least
of the strand must have sever upon the edg of ic then almost
instinct he made hi choic
can you hold him he said swiftli to number two who answer ye
i think so in a muffl voic
then i go to help him
if you slip i cannot bear you both said the muffl voic
no answer godfrei and draw the sheath knife he wore
deliber cut the rope which join him to number two
then he scrambl down to the ledg without much difficulti reach
it but just in time for now the razor blade of the ic had cut half
through the rope and veri soon the swing of the senseless weight
beneath must complet it work thi ledg be broad though
slope wa not a particularli bad place moreov on it were littl
hummock of ic result from snow that had melt and frozen again
against on of which godfrei wa abl to rest hi left shoulder and
even to pass hi arm round it but here came the rub he could not get
suffici grip of the thin rope with hi right hand beyond the point
where it wa cut to enabl him to support even half the weight that
hung below should it sever as it must do veri shortli it would be
torn from hi grasp
what then could be done godfrei peer over the edg the man wa
swing not more than two feet below it brink that is to sai the
updrawn loop of hi stout leather belt to which the rope wa fasten
wa about that distanc from the brink and on either side of it he
hung down like a sack ti round the middl quit motionless in hi
swoon hi head to on side and hi feet to the other
could he reach and grasp that leather belt without fall himself and
if so could he bear the man weight and not be drag over godfrei
shrank from the attempt hi blood curdl then he pictur again in
a mindflash hi poor companion whirl down through space to be
dash to pulp at the bottom and the agoni of hi wife and children
whom he knew and who had wish to prevent him from climb that dai
oh he would try but still a paralys fear overcam him make him
weak and nervou then it wa in godfrei extrem that hi
imagin produc a veri curiou illus quit distinctli he
seem to hear a voic that of miss ogilvi sai to him
do it godfrei at onc or it will be too late we will help you
thi phantasi or whatev it wa seem to give him back hi nerv
and courag coolli he tighten the grip of hi left arm about the
knob of ic and draw himself forward a littl so that hi neck and
part of hi chest were over the edg reach hi right hand downward
hi finger touch the belt to grasp it he must have anoth inch and
a half or two inch he let himself down that distanc oh how easi
it seem to do soand thrust hi finger beneath the belt as he
close them round it the rope part and all the weight that it had
born came upon godfrei arm
how long did he support it he often wonder afterward for ag it
seem he felt as though hi right arm wa be torn from the socket
while the ic cut into the muscl of hi left like activ tortur he
fill himself with air blow out hi lower part so that it muscl
might enabl him to get some extra hold of the rough ground he dug hi
toe deep into the ici snow hi hat fell from hi head rest for a
moment in a ridicul fashion upon the swing bodi beneath then
float off composedli into space the tall feather in it stick
upward and flutter a littl he heard voic approach and abov
them the shout of the guid though what these said convei no
mean to him he must loos hi hold and go too no he would not he
would not although now he felt as though hi shoulderjoint were
disloc also that hi left arm wa slip he would die like a
brave manlik a brave man sure thi wa death he wa
goneeveryth pass awai
godfrei woke again to find himself ly upon a flat piec of snow
recollect came back to him with a pang and he thought that he must
have fallen
then he heard voic and saw face look at him as through a mist
also he felt someth in hi mouth and throat which seem to burn
them on of the voic it wa that of the guid said
good good he find himself thi young english hero see hi ey
open more cognac it will make him happi and prevent the shock never
mind the other on he is all right the stupid
godfrei sat up and tri to lift hi arm to thrust awai the flask which
he saw approach him but he could not
take that burn stuff awai karl confound you he said
then karl a good honest fellow who wa on hi knee besid him threw
hi arm about him and embrac him in a wai that godfrei thought
theatric and unpleas while all the other except the rescu
man who lai semicomatos set up a kind of pan of prais like a
greek choru
oh shut up said godfrei if we wast so much time we shall never
get to the top a remark at which thei all burst out laugh
thei talk of provid on the alp shout karl in stentorian
tone while he perform a kind of wardanc but that the kind of
provid for me and he point to godfrei mani thing have i seen
in my trade as guid but never on like thi what to cut the rope
for the sake of monsieur there and he point to number two whose
share in the great adventur wa be overlook befor give
himself to almost certain death for the sake of monsieur with the weak
heart who had no busi on a mountain to stretch over the precipic
as the line part and hold monsieur with the weak heart for all that
while till i could get a noos round himy to go on hold him
after he himself wa almost deadwithout a mind good god never ha
there been such a stori in my lifetim on these alp or in that of my
father befor me
then came the descent godfrei support on the shoulder of the
stalwart karl who full of delight at thi great escap from tragedi
and at have a tale to tell which would last him for the rest of hi
life jodel spontan at interv in hi best largetip
voic and occasion skip about like a young camel while
monsieur with the weak heart wa carri in a chair provid to bear
elderli ladi up the lower slope of the alp
some swiftfoot mountain had sped down to the villag ahead of
them and told all the stori with the result that when thei reach the
outskirt of the place an excit crowd wa wait to greet them
includ two local report for swiss journal
on of these who contribut item of interest to the english press
also either by mistak or in order to make hi narr more
interest ad to a fairli correct descript of the incid a
statement that the person rescu by godfrei wa a young ladi at
least so the stori appear in the london paper next morn under
the head of heroic rescu on the alp or in some instanc of a
young english hero
among the crowd wa the pasteur who beam at godfrei through hi blue
spectacl but took no part in these excit demonstr when thei
were back at their hotel and the doctor who examin godfrei had
announc that he wa suffer from noth except exhaust and
badli sprain muscl he said simpli
i do not compliment you my dear boi like those other becaus you
act onli as i should have expect of you in the condit still i
am glad that in thi case anoth wa not ad to my long list of
disappoint
i didnt act at all pasteur blurt out godfrei a voic i
thought it wa miss ogilvi told me what to do and i obei
the old gentleman smile and shook hi head as he answer
it is ever thu young friend when we wish to do good we hear a voic
prompt us which we think that of an angel and when we wish to do
evil anoth voic which we think that of a devil but believ me
the lip that utter both of them ar in our own heart the rest come
onli from the excit of the instant there in our heart the angel
and the devil dwell side by side like the two figur in a villag
weatherclock readi to appear now on and now the other as the
breath of our natur blow them
but i heard her said godfrei stubbornli
the excit of the instant repeat the pasteur blandli had i
been so situat i am quit certain that i should have heard all the
deceas whom i have ever known and he pat godfrei dark hair
with hi long thin hand thank god in hi heart for the brave
spirit which he had been pleas to give to thi young man who had
grown so dear to on who lack a son onli thi he did in silenc nor
did he ever allud to the subject afterward except as a commonplac
matterofcours event
notwithstand the jodel which continu outsid hi window to
a late hour and the bouquet of flower which wa sent to him by the
wife of the mayor who felt that a distinct had been confer upon
their villag that would bring them mani visitor in futur season
and ought to be suitabl acknowledg godfrei soon drop into a deep
sleep but in the middl of the night it pass from him and he awok
full of terror now for the first time he understood what he had
escap and how near he had been to ly not in a comfort bed
but a heap of splinter bone and mangl flesh at the foot of a
precipic whenc perhap it would have been imposs ever to
recov hi remain in short hi nerv react and he felt
anyth but a hero rather inde a coward among coward nor did he
wish ever to climb anoth alp the tast had quit depart from him
to tell the truth a full month went by befor he wa himself again
and dure that month he wa as timid as a kitten and as care of
hi person safeti as a welltodo old ladi unaccustom to travel
chapter xi
juliett farewel
when godfrei return to the maison blanch wear a handsom gold
watch which had been present to him with an effus letter of
thank by the gentleman whom he had rescu and hi rel he found
himself quit a celebr most of the pasteur congreg met him
when he descend from the dilig and wave their hat but as he
thank heaven did not jodel
leav the pasteur to make some acknowledg he fled to the hous
onli to find madam juliett a number of friend to sai noth of
jean the cook and the servant girl await him there madam beam
and look as though she were about to kiss him the fresh and charm
juliett shook hi hand and murmur into hi ear that she had no idea
he wa so brave also that everi night she thank the bon dieu for
hi escap while the other said someth appropriateor the revers
onc more he fled thi time to hi bedroom there upon hi
dressingt lai two letter on from hi father and on address
in a curiou point handwrit which he did not know thi he
open at onc it wa in french and ran as translat
ah littl brotheri know all that ha happen to you nor did
your godmoth need to wait to read about it in the journal
inde i saw it in my crystal befor it happen you with the
man hang to your arm and the rest but then a cloud came over
the crystal and i could not see the end i hope that he would
pull you over the edg so that in on short minut you becam
noth but a red plumpud at the bottom of the gulf for you
know that the sweetesttemp fairi godmoth can be made cross
by wick ingratitud and evil treatment do not think littl
brother that i have forgiven you for bring that old
pasteurfool to insult and threaten me not so i prai the speerit night
and dai to pai you back in your own coin you who have insult
them also inde it wa thei who arrang thi littl incid
but thei tell me that some other speerit interf at the last
moment and save you if so better luck next time for do not
think you shall escap me and them had you been true to us you
should have had great good fortun and everyth you desir in
life includ perhap someth that you desir most of all
as it is you shall have much troubl and lose what you desir
most of all have you been kiss that pretti mademoisel again
and try to make her as bad as her mother well i hope you
will becaus it will hurt that old foolpasteur wherev you go
rememb that ey follow you mine and those of the speerit
hate and bad luck to you my littl brother from your dear
godmamma whose good heart you have so outrag so fare ill till
you hear from me again ye and alwai now you will guess my
name so i need not sign it
pseleanor also send you her hate from anoth sphere
thi preciou epistl fill with malign reach him in the midst
of so mani congratul struck upon godfrei like a blast of ici
wind at the zenith of a summer dai to tell the truth also it
frighten him
he had tri to forget all about madam rienn and now here she wa
stab him from afar for the letter bore a venic postmark it mai
be foolish but few of us care to be the object of a concentr
person hate perhap thi is due to the inherit superstit of
our race not long emerg from the black of barbar but at
least we still feel as our forefath did as though the will to work
evil had the power to bring about the evil desir it is nonsens
sinc were it true none could escap the direst misfortun as everi
on of us is at some time or anoth the object of the hate or jealousi
of other human be moreov as most of us believ there is a
be not human that hate us individu and collect and
certainli would compass our destruct had he the power which
happili he ha not unless we ourselv give it to him
godfrei comfort himself with thi reflect also with anoth
that in thi instanc the issu of hi peril had been far differ
from what hi enemi desir yet with hi nerv still shaken both by
hi spiritualist experi and by those of the danger which he had
pass the letter undoubtedli did affect him in the wai that it wa
meant to do and the worst of it wa that he could not consult hi
friend and guid the pasteur becaus of the allus to the scene
with juliett
throw it down as though it were a venom snake which inde it
wa he open that from hi father which wa brief it congratul
him coldli on hi escap whereof mr knight said he had heard not in
the wai that he would have expect from himself but through the
paper thi it mai be explain wa not strang sinc the account
wa telegraph long befor godfrei had time to write as a matter of
fact howev he had not written for who care to indit epistl to
an unsympathet and critic recipi most peopl onli compos
letter for the benefit of those who like to receiv them and by
intuit read in them a great deal more than the sender record in
black and white for letterwrit at it best is an allus art
someth that suggest rather than describ it wa becaus godfrei
appreci thi truth in a half unconsci fashion that he did not
care to undertak an activ correspond with hi father it is the
except also for young men to care to correspond with their father
the respect outlook and often the respect interest ar too
divers with mother it is differ at ani rate sometim for in
their case the relationship is more intim in the instanc of the
male parent throughout the realm of natur it is apt to have an
accident aspect or to acquir on as time goe by
the letter went on to request that he would climb no more alp sinc
he had been sent to switzerland to scale not mountain but the peak
of knowledg it ad with that naiv selfish from which
sometim even the most piou ar not exempt had you been kill in
addit to lose your own life which would not so much have
matter sinc i trust that you would have pass to a better you
would have done a wrong to your famili in that event as you ar not
yet of ag i believ the monei which your friend left to you recent
would have return to her estat instead of go to benefit your
natur heir
godfrei ponder over the word natur heir wonder who these
might be come final to the conclus that he had but on name
hi father which account for the solicitud express so earnestli
in the letter he utter an explet which should not have pass
hi youth lip and threw it down upon the top of that of madam
rienn
after thi he left the room much depress and watch hi
opportun for the merri parti in the salon who had gather to
greet him were still there drink heavi white wine he slip
through the back door to walk in the wood these wood were lone
but then thei suit hi mood in truth never had he felt more alon
in hi life hi father and he were utterli differ and estrang
and he had no other rel in friend he wa equal lack miss
ogilvi whom he had begun to love wa dead and a friend in heaven is
some wai off although he did think he had heard her voic when he wa
so near to join her
there remain no on save the pasteur of whom he wa grow truli
fond so much so that he wish that the old gentleman had been
appoint to be hi father accord to the flesh the rest of the
world wa a blank to him except for isobel who had desert him
besid some new sentiment had enter into hi relat with isobel
wherebi these were half spoil of cours although he did not
altogeth understand it thi wa the etern complic of sex
which curs more than it bless in the world of sex the eat fire
that is so beauti but burn for when that fire ha pass over the
flower of friendship thei ar chang into some new growth that
howev gorgeou it mai be yet alwai smell of flame sex be the
origin of life is necessarili also the origin of troubl sinc life
and troubl ar insepar and devour the gentl joi of friendship
as a kite devour littl sing bird these go to it susten it
is true and both ar bird but the kite is a veri differ creatur
from the nightingal or the lark on of the great advantag of
matrimoni if it endur long enough is that when the sex attract
which wa it caus ha fade or practic di onc more it make
friendship possibl
perhap the best thing of the littl we have been told about heaven is
that in it there will be no sex if there were it is doubt whether
it could remain heaven as we defin that state sinc then must come
desir and jealousi and selfish and disappoint also
birth and death sinc we cannot conceiv sexlov without an object
or a begin without an end from all of which troubl we learn that
the angel ar reliev
now thi wondrou burn mantl of sex had fallen on godfrei and
isobel as he had learn when he saw her with the knight in armour in
the garden and everyth wa chang beneath it fieri smother
fold and for him there wa no isobel hi friend had gone and he wa
left wander alon hi distress wa deep and sinc he wa too young
to mask hi feel as peopl must learn to do in life it show
itself upon hi face at supper that night all of the littl parti
observ it for he who should have been gai wa sad and spoke littl
afterward when the pasteur and godfrei went to the observatori to
resum their astronom studi the former look at him a while
and said
what is the matter godfrei tell me
i cannot he repli colour
is it so bad as that then i thought that perhap you had onli
receiv a letter or letter
i receiv two of them on wa from my father who scold me becaus
i wa nearli kill
inde he seem fond of scold your father but that is no new
thing and on to which you should be us how about the other letter
wa it perchanc from madam rienn
it is not sign but i think so
realli it is odd but i too have had a letter from madam rienn
also unsign and i think after read it that you mai safe show
me your and then tell me the truth of all these accus she make
concern you and juliett
now godfrei turn crimson
how can i he murmur for myself i do not care but it seem like
betrayingsomeon els
it is difficult my boi to betrai that which is alreadi well known
to me among other had thi letter perchanc someth to do with
an expedit which you two young peopl made to search for flower
and noth els ah i see it is so then you mai safe show it to
me sinc i know all about that expedit
so godfrei produc the epistl for at the moment he forgot that it
contain allus to madam also and hold it gingerli between hi
thumb and finger hand it to him the pasteur read it through without
show the slightest emot
ah he said when he had finish in her wai she is quit
magnific that old witch but sure on dai unless she repent
she will be accommod with some particular hell of her own sinc
there ar few worthi to share it with her you see my boi what she
sai about madam well as i think i told her that dear wife of mine
mai have had her foolish moment like most other if all the truth
were known but note thisther is a great differ between those
who have foolish moment of whatev sort and those who make it their
busi to seek such moment further between those who repent of
their error and those who glori in and try to continu them if you
have ani doubt of that studi the bibl and read amongst other of
david who live to write the psalm and of mari magdalen who becam
a saint also although thi did not occur to that tiger of a woman i
mai have known of those moment and even done my best to help my wife
out of them and been well rewardedher hi kind old face beam
like the sunoh ye most glorious reward so a fig for the old
witch and her tale of madam and now tell me the truth about yourself
and juliett with a mind at eas for juliett ha told it to me
alreadi and i wish to compar the stori
so godfrei told him everyth and a ridicul littl tale it wa
when he had finish the pasteur burst out laugh
you ar inde sinner you two he said so great that sure you
should stand dress in white sheet on on either side of the altar
with the crush flower in the middl ah that is what i regret thi
flower for it is veri rare onli onc have i found it in all my life
and then as there wa no ladi present i left it where it grew
hearken all thi is a pack of nonsens
hearken again godfrei everybodi thing me an old fool how can it be
help with such a face as mine and these blue spectacl which i
must wear but even an old fool see thing sometim thu i have
seen that madam who had onc plenti of monei to plai with and long
poor dear for the fine thing of life is veri anxiou that her
juliett should make a good marriag i have seen too that she ha
thought of you whom she think much richer than you ar as a good
match for juliett and ha done her best to make juliett think as she
doe all of which is quit natur in her and inde praiseworthi
especi if she like and respect the young man but my boi it is
the greatest nonsens to begin with you do not and never will care
for juliett and she doe not and never will care for you your
natur ah thei ar quit differ you have someth big in the
you and juliettewel she ha not marriag with her would be for
you a miseri and for juliett a miseri also sinc what have you in
common besid even if it were otherwis do you think i would allow
such a thing with you so young and in my charg bah be good friend
with that pretti girl and go hunt for flower with her as much as you
like for noth will ever come of it onli bet no more in kiss
for thei ar danger and spark sometim set fire to haystack
inde i will not exclaim godfrei with fervour
there then that troubl is finish here although he did not
know it the pasteur wa mistaken and now as to the rest of thi
letter it is malign malign and it writer will alwai seek to
do you ill and perhap sometim succe it is the price which you
must pai for have mix with such a person who mix with the devil
though that wa no fault of your my boi still alwai alwai in the
world we ar suffer from the fault of other it is a law the law
of vicari sacrific which run through everyth why we do not
know still be not afraid for it is you who will win at the last not
she for the rest soon you will go awai from here sinc the year for
which you came is almost finish and you must turn your mind to the
bigger life i prai you when you do not to forget me for my boi i
who have no son have learn to love you like a son better perhap
than had you been on sinc often i have observ that it is not
alwai father and son that love each other most frequent the other
wai inde
also i prai anoth thing of youthat if you think i have ani wisdom
or ani littl light in the lamp of thi ugli old bodi of mine you
will alwai take me for a counsellor and write to me concern your
troubl as inde you must do for rememb i am your truste of
thi properti and perhap pai attent to the advic i mai give and
now let us get to our star thei ar much more amus than madam
rienn it is strang to think that the same god who made the star
also made madam rienn truli he is a charit and toler god
perhap the devil made her suggest godfrei
it mai be so it mai be so but is it not said in the book of
proverb i believ that he make both good and evil for hi own
infinit end though what these mai be i worm that i am cannot
pretend to understand and now to our star that ar far awai and pure
though who know but that if on were near to them thei would prove as
full of foul as the earth
the pasteur wa right when he said that madam rienn would not ceas
from attempt to do evil to godfrei and therefor wrong when he ad
that the troubl she had caus wa finish of thi that young man
wa made painfulli awar when a fortnight or so later anoth letter
from hi father reach him it inform him that mr knight had
receiv an anonym commun which state that he godfrei wa
lead an evil life in lucern also that he wa be entrap into
a marriag with mademoisel boiset whom he had been seen embrac
behind some rock the letter end
lack proof i do not accept these stori as fact although
as there is no smoke without fire i think it probabl that there
is someth in them and that you ar drift into undesir
companionship at ani rate i am sure that the time ha come for
you to return home and to commenc your studi for the church i
have to request therefor that you will do thi at onc as i am
enter your name at my own colleg for the next term and have so
inform the truste under miss ogilvi will who will no doubt
meet the expens and give you a suitabl allow i am write
to the pasteur boiset to the same effect look forward to
see you when we can discuss all these matter in more detail
i am your affection father
richard knight
in dismai godfrei took thi letter to the pasteur for the last thing
godfrei wish to do wa to leav kleindorf and the hous in which he
wa so welcom and so well treat in order to return to the stoni
bosom of monk acr abbei
i have also receiv a letter said monsieur boiset it seem that
you and i alwai receiv disagre letter togeth the last were
from the witchwoman rienn and these ar from your father he ha an
unpleas wai of write thi father of your although he is a good
man for here he suggest that i am try to trap you for a
soninlaw wherein i see the fat finger of that witch rienn who ha
so great a passion for the anonym epistl well if he had said that
i wish to trap you for a son he would have shot nearer to the
bullsey but for a soninlaw as you know it is not so still you
must go inde it is time that you went now that you talk french so
well and have i hope learnt other thing also you to whom the big
world open but see your father talk of your enter the church
tell me is thi so if so of cours i shall be happi
no said godfrei shake hi head
then repli the pasteur i mai sai that i am equal happi it is
not everyon that ha a call for thi vocat and there ar more wai
of do good in the world than from the floor of a pulpit myself i
have wonder sometimesbut let that be it is the lot of certain of
us who think in our vaniti that we could have done great thing to be
oblig to do the small thing becaus god ha so decre to on he
give the ten talent to the other onli on talent or even but a
franc whatev it be of it we must make the best and so long as we
do not buri it we have done well i can onli sai that i have tri to
us my franc or my fifti centim to such advantag as i could and
hope that in some other place and time i mai be entrust with a larger
sum oh my boi we ar all of us drawn by the hors of circumst
but as i believ those hors have a driver who know whither he is
guid us
a few dai later godfrei went hi last middai meal at the maison
blanch befor he depart to catch the night train for pari wa
rather a melancholi function madam who had grown fond of him in her
somewhat frivol wai openli drop tear into her soup juliett
look sad and distrait though inwardli support by the knowledg
that her distant cousin the notari jule wa arriv on the morrow
to spend hi vacat at the maison blanch so that godfrei room
would not be without an occup inde in her pretti littl head she
wa alreadi plan certain alter in the arrang of the
furnitur to make it more comfort to the veri differ tast of
the new comer
still she wa truli sorri to lose her friend the hibou although she
had not been abl to fulfil her mother wish and make him fall in
love with her or even to fall in love with him herself as she
explain to madam boiset it wa of no us to try sinc between
their natur there were fix not onli a great gulf but sever whole
rang of the alp and wherea the hibou sat gaze at the star
from their topmost peak she wa pick flower in the plain and
sing as she pick them
the pasteur did not make matter better by the extrem forc gaieti
of hi demeanour he told stori and crack bad joke in the
interv of congratul godfrei at hi releas from so dull a place
as kleindorf godfrei said littl or noth but reflect to himself
that the pasteur did not know monk acr
at last the moment came and he depart with a heavi heart for he had
learn to love these simpl kindli folk especi the pasteur how
glad he wa when it wa over and he had lost sight of the handkerchief
that were be wave at him from the gate as the hire vehicl roll
awai not that it wa quit over for the pasteur accompani him to
the station in order as he said to take hi last instruct about
the villa ogilvi although in truth godfrei had none to give
pleas do what you think best wa all that he could sai also when
sever mile further on thei came to a turn in the road there
pant on a rock stood juliett who had reach the place run
at full speed by a short cut through the wood thei had no time to
stop becaus the pasteur thought that thei were late for the train
which as a matter of fact did not leav for halfanhour after thei
reach the station so thei could onli make mutual signal of
recognit and farewel juliett who look as though she were
cry kiss her hand to him call out
adieu adieu cher ami while he sought refug in the englishman
usual expedi of take off hi hat
it is noth noth said the pasteur who had also note
juliett tearswollen ey tomorrow she will have jule to consol
her a most worthi young man though me he bore
here it mai be ad that jule consol her so well that within a
year thei were marri and most happili
yet godfrei wa destin never to see that grace figur and gai
littl face again sinc long befor he revisit lucern juliett di
on the birth of her third child and soon who thought of juliett
except perhap godfrei for her husband marri again veri shortli as
a worthi and domest person of the sort would do her children were
too young to rememb her and her mother not long afterward wa
carri off by a sudden ill pneumonia to join her in the shade
except the pasteur himself none wa left
well such is the wai of thi sad world of chang and death but
godfrei never forgot the pictur of her stand breathless on the rock
and kiss her slim hand to him it wa on of those incid which
when thei happen to a man in hi youth remain indel impress upon
hi mind
at the station there were more farewel for here wa the notari who
had manag miss ogilvi swiss affair and now under the direct of
monsieur boiset attend to those of godfrei also such of the
servant were present as had been kept on at the villa while among
those walk about the platform he saw brother josiah smith and
professor petersen who had come evid to see the last of him and
make report to a certain quarter
the pasteur talk continu in hi high thin voic to cover up
hi agit but what it wa all about godfrei could never rememb
all he recollect of the part wa be taken into those long arm
embrac upon the forehead and most fervent bless
then the train steam off and he felt glad that all wa over

about fortyeight hour later godfrei arriv duli at the littl essex
station three mile from monk acr there wa nobodi to meet him
which wa not strang as the hour of hi come wa unknown still
unreason as it might be the contrast between the warmth and
affect that had distinguish hi departur and the cold vacuum
that greet hi arriv chill him he said a few word to the
grumpi old porter who wa the sole occup of the platform but that
worthi although he knew him well enough did not seem to realis that
he had ever been awai dure the year in which so mani thing had
happen to godfrei noth at all had happen to the porter and
therefor he did not appreci the laps of time
leav hi baggag to be brought by the carrier cart godfrei took
the alpenstock that in a moment of enthusiasm the guid had given him
as a souvenir of hi great adventur and start for home it wa a
veri famou alpenstock which thi guid and hi father befor him had
us all their live on that had been plant in the topmost snow of
everi peak in switzerland inde the name of the most unclimb of
these togeth with the date of their conquest by it owner
sometim follow by cross to show that on such or such an
expedit life had been lost were burnt into the tough wood with a
hot iron as the first of these date wa as far back as 1831 godfrei
valu thi staff highli and did not like to leav it to the chanc
of the carrier cart
hi road through the field ran past hawk hall of which he observ
with a thrill of dismai that the blind were drawn as though in it
someon lai dead there wa no reason why he should have been dismai
sinc he had heard that isobel had gone awai to somewher in ameriki
as mr parson had express it in a brief and illspelt letter and
that sir john wa live in town yet the sight depress him still
further with it suggest of death or of separ which is almost
as bad for be it rememb he wa at an ag when such impress
come home
after leav the hall with it blind and shutter window hi
quickest road to the abbei hous ran through the churchyard here the
first thing that confront him wa a gigant monument of which the
new marbl glitter in the afternoon sun it wa a confus affair
and all he made out of it without close examin wa a lifes
angel with an earlyvictorian counten lean against the broken
stump of an oak tree and scatter from a basket of the kind that is
us to collect nut or windfal appl on to a sarcophagu beneath a
profus of marbl rose some of which seem to have been arrest
and frozen in midair he glanc at the inscript in gold letter
it wa to the belov memori of ladi jane blake wife of sir john
blake bart jp and daughter of the right hon the earl of
lynfield whose bereav husband erect thi monumenth husband
praiseth her
godfrei look and rememb the gentl littl woman whose crumbl
flesh lai beneath shiver at the aw and crush erect abov
in life as he knew she had been unhappi but what had she done to
deserv such a memori in death still she wa dead of that there
wa no doubt and oh the sad of it all
he went on to the abbei resist a queer temptat to enter the
church and look at the tomb of the plantagenet ladi and her unknown
knight who slept there so quietli from year to year through spring
summer autumn and winter for ever and for ever the front door wa
lock so he rang the bell it wa answer by a new servant rather a
forbid middleag woman with a limp who inform him that mr
knight wa out and notwithstand hi explan declin to admit
him into the hous doubtless she thought that a young man wear a
foreignlook hat and carri such a strang long stick must be a
thief or wors the end of it wa that she slam the door in hi
face and shot the oldfashion bolt
then godfrei bethought him of the other door that which led into the
ancient refectori which wa now us as a schoolroom thi wa open
so he went in and be tire after hi long journei sat himself down
in the chair at the end of the old oak tabl that same chair in which
isobel had kiss him when he wa a littl boi he look about him
vagu the place of cours wa much the same as it had been for the
last five hundr year but as he could see from the name on the
copybook that lai about the pupil who inhabit it had chang of
the whole six not on wa the same
then perhap for the first time he began to understand how variabl
is the world a mere pass show in which noth remain the same
except the hous and the tree even these depart for a cottag with
which he had been familiar from hi earliest infanc as he could see
through the open door wa pull down to make room for improv
and the great old elm where the rook us to build had been torn up
in a gale onli it ugli stump and project root were left
so he sat muse there veri depress at heart till at length mr
parson came and discov him in a halfdoz she too wa somewhat
chang for of a sudden ag had begun to take a hold of her her hair
wa white now and her plump round face had wither like a spring
appl still she greet him with the old affect for which he felt
grate see that it wa the first touch of kind he had known
sinc he set foot on english ground
dear me master godfrei she said hadnt i heard that you were
come i could never have been sure that it wa you why youv grown
into a regular young gentleman in those foreign part and handsom
too though i sez it who could have guess that you ar your father
son why youd make two of him but there thei sai that your mother
wa a goodlook ladi and larg built though as i never set ey on
her i cant sai for sure well you must be tire after all thi
travel in steamship and train so come into the diningroom and
have some tea for i have got the kei to the sideboard
he went and pass through the hall left hi alpenstock in the
umbrellastand in due cours the tea wa produc though for it he
seem to have littl appetit while he made pretenc to eat the thick
bread and butter mr parson told him the new such as it wa sir
john wa live in town and fling the monei about so it wa said
not but what he had got lot to fling and plenti to catch it she
ad meaningli hi poor dear ladi wa dead and happi for her on
the whole miss isobel had gone foreign have it wa told
quarrel with her father and noth had been heard of her sinc she
went she too had grown into a fine young ladi
that wa all he gather befor mr parson wa oblig to depart to
see to her businessexcept that she wa exceedingli glad to see him
godfrei went up to hi bedroom which he found unprepar for somebodi
els seem to be sleep there while he wa survei it and
wonder who thi occup might be he heard hi father in the hall
ask the parlourmaid which of the young gentlemen had left that
ridicul stick in the stand she repli that she did not know
whereupon the hard voic of hi parent told her to take it awai
afterward godfrei found it thrown into the woodhous to be chop up
for firewood though luckili befor thi happen
by thi time a kind of anger had seiz him it wa true that he had
not said by what train he wa come for the reason that until he
reach london he could not tell but he had written that he wa to
arriv that afternoon and sure some note might have been taken of
the fact
he went downstair and confront hi father who alon amid so much
chang seem to be exactli the same mr knight shook him by the hand
without ani particular cordial and at onc attack him for not
have intim the hour of hi arriv sai that it wa too late
to advis the carrier to call at the station for hi baggag and that a
trap would have to be sent which cost monei
veri well father i will pai for it myself answer godfrei
oh ye i forgot exclaim mr knight with a sneer you have come
into monei somehow have you not and doubtless consid yourself
independ
ye and i am glad of it father as now i hope i shall not be ani
more expens to you
as you have begun to talk busi godfrei repli hi father in an
acid manner we mai as well go into thing and get it over you have
i presum made up your mind to go into the church in accord with
my wish
no father i do not intend to becom a clergyman
inde you seem to me to have fallen under veri bad influenc in
switzerland howev it doe not much matter as i intend that you
shall
i am sorri but i cannot father
then within such limit as hi pieti permit which were
suffici wide mr knight lost hi temper veri badli inde he
attack hi son suggest that he had been lead an evil life in
lucern as he had learn from outsid sourc and declar that
either he should obei him or be cast off godfrei whose temper by thi
time wa also rise intim that he prefer the latter
altern
what then do you intend to do young man ask mr knight

ad i shall go to london tomorrow to consult my truste under
miss ogilvi will

monei ar you well as we seem to agre so badli why not go tonight
instead of tomorrow there is a late train perhap it would be
pleasant for both of us and then i need not send for your luggag
also it would save my shift the new boi from your room

i am not in the habit of sai what i do not mean onli pleas
understand that if you reject my plan for your career which have been
form after much thought and i mai add prayer i wash my hand of
you who ar now too old to be argu with in ani other wai
godfrei look at hi father and consid the iron mouth cut straight
like a slit across the face the hard insignific counten and
the small cold grei ey he realis the intens of the petti
anger base for the most part on jealousi becaus he wa now
independ and could not be order about and bulli like the rest of
the littl boi and knew that behind it there wa not affect but
dislik sum up all thi in hi quick mind he becam awar that
father or not he regard thi man with great avers their natur
their outlook all about them were antagonist and in fact had been
so from the begin the less that thei saw of each other the better
it would be for both although still so young he had ripen earli
and wa now almost a man who knew that these thing were so without
possibl of doubt
veri well father he said i will go it is better than stop
here to quarrel
i thought you would now that your friend isobel who did you so much
harm with her bad influenc ha depart to mexico where i have no
doubt she ha forgotten all about you you wont be abl to run after
her monei as you did after miss ogilvi repli mr knight with
anoth sneer

ogilvi monei and i will never forgiv you for sai such a thing of
me in connect with isobel and turn he left the room
so did hi father for godfrei heard him go to hi studi and lock the
door doubtless as a sign and a token
then godfrei sought out mr parson and told her everyth the old
woman wa much disturb and wept
i have been think of late master godfrei she said that your
father heart is made of that kind of stone which hell is pave with
onli with the good intent left outit that hard here you ar

chapter xiii
the interven year
now we mai omit a great deal from godfrei youth career within a
few dai he receiv a letter from hi father forward to him from the
hotel that wa even more unpleas than the major of the patern
epistl to which he wa accustom mr knight probabl from honest
convict and a misread of the fact of life wa on of those
person who ar call pacifist although he never carri out the
doctrin in hi own small affair he believ that nation were
enjoin by divin decre to turn the other cheek and inde everi
portion of their corpor frame to the smiter and that by so do
in some mysteri wai thei would attain to profound peac and
felic consequ he hate armi especi as these involv
taxat and loath the trade of soldier which he consid on
of licens murder
the decis of hi son to adopt thi career wa therefor a bitter
blow to him concern which he express hi feel in the plainest
languag end hi epistl by intim hi strong convict that
godfrei have taken the sword wa destin to perish by the sword
also he point out to him that he had turn hi back upon god who
would certainli rememb the affront be he remark a jealou
god and lastli that the less thei saw of each other in futureher
he wa refer to himself not to the divin as the context would
seem to implyth better it would be for both of them
further there wa a postscript about the disgrac conduct of the
woman mr parson who after receiv the shelter of hi hous for
mani year had made a scene and depart leav him in the lurch
hi injunct wa that under no circumst should he godfrei have
anyth more to do with thi violent and treacher femal who had
made him a pretext of quarrel and have learn that he had monei
doubtless wish to get someth out of him
godfrei did not answer thi letter nor did hi father write to him
again for quit a long while
for the rest on the appoint mondai he present himself at garrick
street and began hi cours of tuition under the gener direct of
the wise mr scoon cram as it wa call thi inde
exactli describ the process for all knowledg wa reject except
that which wa like to obtain mark in the cours of an examin
by hidebound person appoint to ascertain who were the individu
best fit to be appoint to variou branch of the public servic
anyth less calcul to secur the select of suitabl men than
such a system cannot well be imagin howev it wa that which
certain nebul author had decre should prevail and there wa
an end of it although in effect it involv and still involv the
frequent sacrific of those qualiti and characterist which ar
essenti to a public servant to other that ar quit the revers
for instanc to a parrotlik memori and the power of acquir a
superfici acquaint with much miscellan inform and
rememb the same for sai six month
although he hate the busi and thought with long of hi studi
stellar and other in the kleindorf observatori godfrei wa quit
clever enough to collect what wa need in fact some three month
later he pass hi examin with eas about halfwai up the list
and duli enter sandhurst
he found the establish at garrick street just such a place as it
owner had describ in it were mani charm but idl young men often
with a certain amount of mean who were go up for the diplomat
servic the foreign offic the indian civil or variou branch of
the armi of these a larg proport enjoi life but did littl els
and in due cours fail in their competit encount with the
examin
other were too stupid to succe or perhap their natur talent had
anoth bent while the remaind by no mean the most brilliant but
with a faculti for pass examin and without ani disturb
origin work hard and sail into their desir haven with
consider facil be of the stuff of which most success men
ar made for the rest there wa the opportun and if thei did not
avail themselv of it scoon wa not to blame it wa and perhap
still remain a most admir institut of it sort on inde
of which the present chronicl ha veri grate recollect
among the pupil studi there wa a young man name arthur thorburn
an orphan with consider expect who live with an aunt in a
fine old hous at queen ann gate he wa a brilliant young man
witti and origin but rash and without persever whom hi
guardian wish to enter the diplomat servic a career in which
without doubt had he ever attain to it he would have achiev a
consider failur in appear he wa of medium height
roundfac lighthair blueei with a constant and most charm
smile in everi wai a complet contrast to godfrei perhap thi wa
the reason of the curiou attach that the two form for each
other unless inde such strong and strang affin have their
root in past individu histori which is veil from mortal ey at
ani rate it happen that on godfrei first dai at scoon he sat
next to arthur thorburn in two class which he attend godfrei
listen intent and made note arthur caricatur the lectur an
art for which he had a nativ gift and pass the result round the
class godfrei saw the caricatur and snigger then when the lectur
were over grave reprov the author sai that he should not do
such thing
why not ask arthur open hi blue ey heaven intend that
stuffi old parrot he had drawn thi learn man as a dilapid fowl
of that speci to be caricatur observ that hi nose is alreadi
half a beak or perhap it is a beak develop into a nose it depend
whether he is on the downward or upward path of evolut
becaus you made me laugh repli godfrei wherebi i lost at least
eighteenpennyworth of inform
a laugh is worth eighteenp suggest arthur
that depend upon how mani eighteenp on possess you mai have
lot some peopl ar short of them
quit true i never look at it in that wai befor i am oblig to
you for put it so plainli said arthur with hi charm smile
such wa the begin of the acquaint of these two and in some
case might have been it end but with them it wa not so arthur
conceiv a sincer admir for godfrei who could speak like thi to
a stranger and at scoon and as much as possibl outsid haunt
him like a shadow soon it wa a regular thing for godfrei to go to
dine at the old georgian hous in queen ann gate upon sundai
even where he becam popular with the rather magnific
earlyvictorian aunt who thought that he exercis a good influenc
upon her nephew sometim too arthur would accompani godfrei to
hampstead and sit smoke and make furtiv caricatur of him and
mr parson while he work and she beam admir the occup
sound dull but somehow arthur did not find it so he said that it
rest hi overwrought brain
look here old fellow said godfrei at length have you ani
intent of pass that examin of your
in the interest of the diplomat servic and of the countri i think
not repli arthur reflect i feel that it is a case where true
altruism becom a duti
then what do you mean to do with yourself
dont know live on my monei i suppos and on that of my respect
aunt after her lament deceas which although i see no sign of it
she tell me she consid immin
i dont wonder arthur with you hang about the hous you ought to
be asham of yourself a man is made to work hi wai through the
world not to idl
like a beetl bore through wood not like a butterfli flit over
flower that what you mean isnt it well butterfli ar nicer
than beetl and some of us like flower better than dead wood but i
sai old chap do you mean it
i do and so doe your aunt
let us waiv my aunt like the poor she is alwai with us and i
ala am well acquaint with her view which ar those of a past
epoch but i am not obstin tell me what to do and ill do
itanyth except enter the diplomat servic to lie abroad for the
benefit of my countri in the word of the ancient sai
there is no fear of that for you would never pass the examin
said the practic godfrei you see you ar too clever he ad by
wai of explan and too much occupi with a dozen thing of which
examin take no account the merit of the variou religi system
for instanc
so ar you interrupt arthur
i know i am i love them id like to talk to you about reincarn
and astronomi of which i know someth and even astrolog and the
surviv of the dead and lot of other thing but i have got to make
my wai in the world and iv no time you think me a heavi bore and an
old fogei becaus i wont go to parti to which lot of those nice
fellow ask me do you suppos i shouldnt like the parti and all the
lark afterward and the jolli actress and the rest of cours i
should for im a man like other but i tell you i havent time iv
flout my father and im on my honour so to speak to justifi myself
and get on so i mean to pass that tomfool examin and to cram down
a lot of stuff in order to do so which is of no more us to me than
though i had swallow so much brown paper foolstuff pulp by fool
to be the food of foolsthat what it is and now im go to shove
some spoon of it down my throat so light your pipe and pleas be
quiet
on moment more of your preciou time interrupt arthur what is
the exact career that you propos to adorn someth foreign i
thinkindian civil servic
no as i have told you a dozen time indian armi
the armi ha pointsposs in the futur it might give a man an
opportun of depart from the world in a fashion that is gener
if in error consid to be decent india too ha still more
point for there anyon with intellig might studi the begin
of civilis which perhap ar also it end my friend i too
will enter the indian armi that is if i can pass the examin
provid me at onc with the necessari book and mr parson be
goodheart enough to bring some of your excel coffe brew
doubl strong do not imagin young man who ought by the wai to
have been born fifti year earlier and marri my aunt that you ar
the onli on who can face and conquer fact even those advanc by
that most accurs of emptyhead bore the man or the maniac call
euclid
so the pair of them studi togeth and by dint of privat tuition in
the even for at scoon where hi talent for caricatur wa too
much for him arthur would do littl or noth godfrei drag hi
friend through the examin the last but on in the list even then
a miracl interven to save him arthur euclid wa hopeless he
hate the whole busi of squar and angl and parallelogram with
such intens that it made him mental and moral sick to hi as
to some other mind it wa utter nonsens devis by a semilunat
for the bewilder of mankind and adopt by other lunat as an
appropri form of tortur of the young
at length in despair godfrei know that arthur had an excel
memori onli the night befor the examin made him learn a coupl
of proposit select out of the book which were to be studi
quit at hazard with injunct that no matter what other
proposit were set he should write out these two pretend that he
had mistaken the question thi arthur did with perfect accuraci and
by the greatest of good luck on of the two proposit wa actual
that which he wa ask to set down while the other wa allow to
pass as an error
so he bump through somehow and in the end the indian armi gain a
most excel offic it is true that there were difficulti when he
explain to hi aunt and hi truste that in some inexplic manner
he had pass for sandhurst instead of into the diplomat servic but
when he demonstr to them that thi wa hi great and final effort
and that noth on earth would induc him to face anoth examin
even to be made a king thei thought it best to accept the accomplish
fact
after all you have pass someth said hi aunt which is more
than anyon ever expect you would do and the armi is respect
for as i have told you my grandfath wa kill at waterloo
ye repli arthur you have told me my dear aunt veri often he
broke hi neck by jump off hi hors when ride toward or from the
battlefield did he not and now i propos to follow hi honour
exampl on the battlefield if possibl or if not in steeplechas
so the pair of them went to sandhurst togeth and togeth in due
cours were gazet to a certain regiment of indian cavalri the onli
differ be that godfrei pass out top and arthur pass out
bottom although in fact he wa much the clever of the two of the
interv between these two examin there is noth that need be
report for their live and the thing that happen to them were as
those of hundr of other young men onli through all thei remain
the fastest of friend so much so that by the influenc of gener
cubitt as ha been said thei manag to be gazet to the same
regiment
dure those two year godfrei never saw hi father and commun
with him but rare hi winter vacat were spent at mr parson
hous in hampstead work for the most part sinc he wa absolut
determin to justifi himself and get on in the profess which he had
chosen in the summer he and arthur went walk tour and onc with
some other young men visit the contin to studi variou
battlefield and improv their mind at least godfrei studi the
battlefield while arthur gave most of hi attent to the younger
part of the femal popul of franc and itali at easter again thei
went to scotland where arthur had some properti settl on himfor he
wa a young man well suppli with thi world goodsand fish for
salmon and trout altogeth for godfrei it wa a profit and
happi two year at sandhurst and elsewher everyon thought well of
him while old gener cubitt becam hi devot friend and could not
sai enough in hi prais
damn it sir he exclaim onc do you mean to tell me that you
never overdraw your allow it is not natur almost wrong inde
i wonder what your secret vice ar well so long as you keep them
secret you ought to be a big man on dai and end up in a veri
differ posit to georg cubittecal a generalwho never saw a
shot fire in hi life therel be lot of them fly about befor
your old my boi and doubtless youll get your share of
gunpowderor nitroglycerineif you go on as you have begun if i
werent afraid of make you cocki id tell you what thei sai about
you down at that sandhurst shop where i have an old pal or two
shortli after thi came the final examin through which as ha
been said godfrei sail out top an easi first indeeda posit to
which hi thorough knowledg of french and gener aptitud for foreign
languag togeth with hi power of work and applic realli
entitl him all hi friend were delight especi arthur who
look on him as a kind of lusu natur and from hi humbl posit
at the bottom of the tree gaze admiringli at godfrei perch upon it
topmost bough the old pasteur too with whom godfrei kept up an
almost weekli correspond continu hi astronom studi by
letter wa enraptur and cover him with compliment as did hi
instructor at the colleg
all of thi would have been enough to turn the head of mani young men
but as it happen godfrei wa by natur modest with enough
intellig to appreci the abysm depth of hi own ignor by
the light of the littl lamp of knowledg with which he had furnish
himself on hi journei into their black thi intens modesti
alwai remain a lead characterist of hi which endear him to
mani although it wa not on that help him forward in life it is
the bold selfconfid man who know how to make the most of hi
small gift who travel fastest and farthest in thi world of our
when howev actual he receiv quit an affection and pleas
letter from hi father he did for a while feel a littl proud the
letter enclos a cut from the local paper record hi success
and dig up for the benefit of it reader an account of hi
adventur on the alp also it mention promin that he wa the
son of the rev mr knight the incumb of monk abbei and had
receiv hi educ in that gentleman establish so
promin inde that even the unsuspici godfrei could not help
wonder if hi father had ever seen that paragraph befor it appear
in print the letter end with thi passag
we have not met for a long while ow to caus to which i will
not allud and i suppos that shortli you will be go to india
if you care to come here i should like to see you befor you leav
england thi is natur as after all you ar my onli child and i
am grow old onc you have depart to that far countri who
know whether we shall ever meet again in thi world
godfrei a generousheart and forgiv person wa much touch when
he read these word and wrote at onc to sai that if it were
conveni he would come down to monk abbei at the begin of the
follow week and spend some of hi leav there so in due cours he
went
as it happen at about the same time destini had arrang that
anoth charact in thi histori wa return to that quiet essex
villag name isobel blake
isobel went to mexico with her uncl and there had a most interest
time she studi aztec histori with her usual thorough so well
inde that she becam a recognis author on the subject she
climb popocatepetl the mysteri sleep woman that overhand
the ancient town and look into it crater greatli dare she even
visit yucatan and saw some of the preaztec remain for thi
adventur she paid with an attack of fever which never quit left her
system inde that fever had a peculiar effect upon her which mai
have been physic or someth els isobel fault or rather
characterist as the reader mai have gather wa that she built too
much upon the materi side of thing what she saw what she knew
what her bodi told her what the record experi of the world
taughtthes were real all the rest to her wa phantasi or
imagin she kept her feet upon the solid ground of fact and left
all els to dreamer or as she would have express it to the
victim of superstit inherit or acquir
well someth happen to her at the crisi of that fever which wa
sharp and took her on her return from yucatan at a horribl port
call frontera where there were palm tree and zopilotesa kind of
vile american vulturewhich sat silent on the verandah outsid her
door in the dread littl hotel built upon pile in the mud of the
great river and mosquito by the ten million and sleepyei
crushedlook indian and horribl halfbre and everyth els
which suggest an earthli hell except the gloriou sunshin
of a sudden when she wa at her worst all the materialityif there
be such a wordwhich circumst and innat tendenc had woven about
her as a garment seem to melt awai and she becam awar of
someth vast in which she float like an insect in the
atmospheresom surround sea which she could neither measur nor
travel
she knew that she wa not mere isobel blake but a part of the
univers in it largest sens and that the univers express itself
in miniatur within her soul she knew that ever sinc it had been she
wa and that while it exist she would endur thi imagin or
inspir whichev it mai have been went no further than that and
afterward she set it down to delirium or to the exalt that often
accompani fever still it left a mark upon her open a new door
in her heart so to speak
for the rest the life in mexico citi wa gai especi in the
posit which she fill as the niec of the british minist who wa
often call upon to act as hostess as her aunt wa delic and her
cousin wa younger than herself and not apt at the busi there were
diaz and the foreign diplomat minist also the lead mexican to
be entertain for which purpos she learn spanish then there were
english travel distinguish some of them and german nobl
gener in the diplomat servic of their countri whom by some
peculiar feminin instinct of her own she suspect of be spi and
gener person of evil intent also there wa the british
coloni among whom were some veri nice peopl that she made her
friend the strang adventur pioneer of our empir who ar to be
bound in everi part of the world and in a sens it cream
lastli there were the american tourist and busi men mani of whom
she thought amus on of these a millionair who had to do with a
beef trust though what that might be she never quit understood
propos to her he wa a nice young fellow enough of a real old
american famili whose ancestor were suppos to have come over in the
mayflow and possess of a remark vein of origin humour
also he wa much in love but isobel would have none of it and said so
in such plain unmistak languag that the millionair straightwai
left mexico citi in hi privat railwai car disconsol to pursu
hi beef specul in other land
on the dai that he depart isobel receiv a note from him which ran
i have lost you and sinc i am too soreheart to stai in thi
antiqu countri and conclud the busi that brought me here i
reckon that i have also lost 250000 dollar that sum howev i
would gladli have given for the honour and joi of your friendship
and as much more ad so i think it well spent especi as it
never figur in my account goodby god bless you and whoever
it mai be with whom you ar in love for that there is someon i
am quit sure also that he must be a good fellow
from which it will be seen that thi millionair wa a veri nice young
man so at least thought isobel though he did write about her be
in love with someon which wa the rankest nonsens in love inde
why she had never met a man for whom she could possibl entertain ani
feel of that sort no not even if he had been abl to make a queen
of her or to endow her with all the cash resourc of all the beef
trust in the world men in that aspect were repel and hate to
her the possibl of such a union with ani on of them wa
poison even unnatur to her soul and bodi
onc it is true there had been a certain boybut he had pass out
of her lifeoh year ago and what is more had affront her by
refus to answer a letter which she had written to him just as she
imaginedthough of cours thi wa onli a guessbecaus of hi
ridicul and unwarrant jealousi and the atroci pride that wa
hi fail also she had read in the paper of a veri brave act which
he had done on the alp on which fill her with a pride that wa not
atroci but quit natur where an old playmat wa concern and
had notic that it wa a young ladi whom he had rescu that of
cours explain everyth and if her first supposit should be
incorrect would quit account for her have receiv no answer to her
letter
it wa true howev that she had heard no more of thi young ladi
though scrap of gossip concern godfrei did occasion reach her
for instanc she knew that he had quarrel with hi father becaus
he would not enter the church and wa go into the armi a career
which she much prefer especi as she did not believ in the
church and could not imagin what godfrei would look like in a black
coat and a white tie
by the wai she wonder what he did look like now she had an old
fade photograph of him as a lanki youth but after all thi time he
could not in the least resembl that well probabl he had grown as
plain and uninterestinga she wa herself it wa wonder that the
american young man could have seen anyth in her but then no doubt
he went on in the same kind of wai with half the girl he met
thu reflect isobel and a littl while later paid a last visit to
the museum which interest her more than ani place in mexico perhap
becaus it exhibit strengthen her theori as to compar
religion and shook off her feet the dust of what her american admir
had call that antiqu land it wa with a posit pang that from
the deck of the steamship outsid vera cruz she look her last on the
snow of the gloriou peak of orizaba but soon these fade awai into
the skylin and with them her life in mexico
return to england via the west indi in the compani of her uncl
who wa come home on leav befor take up an appoint as
minist to on of the south american republ she wa greet on the
platform at waterloo by her father sir john blake had by thi time
forgotten their previou disagr or at ani rate determin to
ignor them and isobel who wa now in her wai a finish woman of the
world though she did not forget had come to a like conclus so
their meet wa cordial enough and for a while not a veri long
while thei continu to live togeth in outward amiti with a tacit
understand that thei should follow their respect path
unmolest by each other
chapter xiv
togeth
on the afternoon of the first dai after hi arriv at the abbei some
spirit in hi feet move godfrei to go into the church as though by
instinct he went to the chancel and stood there contempl the
brass of the nameless plantagenet ladi how long it wa sinc he had
look upon her graven face and form drape in the state habili
of a bygon ag then he rememb with a pang isobel wa with him
and thei had seem to be veri near togeth now there wa no isobel
and thei were veri far apart both in the spirit and in the flesh for
he had not heard of her return to england and imagin that she wa
still in mexico whenc no tide of her came to him
there he stood among the dead reflect that we do not need to pass
out of the bodi to know the mean of death sinc as onc isobel had
said herself some separ ar as bad or wors the stori of the
dead is at ani rate complet there is noth more to be learn
about them and of them we imagin perhap quit erron that we
have no need to be jealou sinc we cannot conceiv that thei mai form
new interest in anoth sphere but with the live it is otherwis
somewher their life is continu somewher thei ar get
themselv friend or lover and carri on the daili round of be
and we have no share in them or in aught that thei mai do and probabl
thei have forgotten us and if we still happen to be attach to them
oh it hurt
thu muse godfrei try to pictur to himself what isobel look
like when she had stood by hi side on that longpast autumn ev and
onli succeed in rememb exactli what she look like when she wa
kiss a rose with a certain knight in armour in a squar garden
sinc for some pervers reason it wa thi pictur that remain so
painfulli clear to hi mind then he drift off into specul upon
the gener mysteri of thing of a sort that were common with him and
in these becam oblivi of all els
he did not even hear or see a tall young woman enter the church clad
in summer white no not when she wa within five pace and becom
suddenli awar of hi presenc had stop to studi him with the
acutest interest in a flash isobel knew who he wa of cours he wa
much chang for godfrei who had matur earli as those of hi
gener were apt to do especi if thei had led a vari life
wa now a handsom and wellbuilt young man with a fine thought
face and a quit respect moustach
how he ha chang oh how he ha chang she thought to herself
the raw boi had becom a man and as she knew at onc by her woman
instinct a man with a great deal in him isobel wa a sensibl member
of her sex on too who had seen someth of the world by now and
she did not expect or wish for a hero or a saint built upon the
midvictorian pattern as portrai in the book of the ladi novelist
of that period she want a man to be a man by prefer with the
fault pertain to the male natur sinc she had observ that those
who lack these possess other which to her robust womanhood
seem far wors such as mean and avaric and backbit and all
the other qualiti of the pharise
well in godfrei whether she were right or wrong with that swift
glanc of her she seem to recognis a man as she wish a man to
be if that standard of her meant that veri possibl he had admir
other women the ladi whom he had pull up a precipic for instanc
she did not mind particularli so long as he admir her isobel most
of all that wa her on sine qua non that he should admir her most
of all or rather be fondest of her in hi innermost self
what wa she think about what wa there to show that he care on
brass farth about her noth at all and yet why wa he here
where she had part from him so long ago sure not to stare at the
grave of a dead woman with whom he could have had noth to do sinc
she left the world some five centuri befor and anoth question
what had brought her here she who hate church and all the mummeri
that thei signifi
would he never wake up would he never realis her presenc oh then
he could care noth about her probabl he wa think of the girl
he had pull up a cliff in the alp but why did he come to thi place
to think of her
isobel stood quit still there and wait in the shadow of a georgian
tomb till present godfrei did seem to grow awar that he wa no
longer alon someth or somebodi had imping upon hi intellig
he began to look about him though alwai in the wrong direct then
convinc that he wa the victim of fanci he spoke aloud as he had a
bad habit of do when by himself
it veri curiou he said but i could have sworn that isobel wa
here as near me as when we part i suppos that is what come of
think so much about her or do peopl leav someth of themselv
behind in place where thei have experienc emot if so church
ought to be veri full of ghost i dare sai that thei ar onli then no
on could know it except those who had share the emot and
therefor thei remain intang still i could have sworn that isobel
wa here inde i seem to feel her now and i hope that the dream
will go on
listen there in the shadow she heard and flush in her flesh and
rejoic in her innermost be so he had not forgotten her which
is the true and real infidel that never can be forgiven at ani
rate by a woman so she wa still someth in hi life although he
had not answer her letter year ago
then she grew angri with herself what did it matter to her what he
wa or thought or did it wa absurd that she could be depend
moral upon anyon who must reli in life or death upon herself alon
and on the strong soul within her she wa wroth with godfrei for
excit such disturb inwhat wa ither spirit or her bodi
nonsens she had no spirit that wa a phantasi therefor it must be
in her bodi which wa her own particular properti that should remain
uninfluenc by ani other bodi
so it came about that the first word she spoke to him were somewhat
rough in their textur she step forward out of the shadow of the
georgian tomb and confront him with a defiant air her head thrown
back look to tell the truth rather state
i hope that by thi time you had given up talk to yourself
godfrei which as i alwai told you is a bad habit i did not hear
much of what you were mumbl but i understood you to sai that you
thought i wa here well why shouldnt i be here
he stare at her blankli and answer
god know i dont but sinc you ask the question why ar you
here isobel it is isobel isnt it or am i still dream let me
touch you and i shall know
she drew back a littl wai quit three inch
of cours it is isobel dont your sens tell you that without
want to touch me why i knew it wa you from the end of the church
but you ask me why i am here i wish you would tell me i wa pass
and someth drew me into thi place i suppos it wa you and if so
i sai at onc that i resent it you have no right
no no certainli not but do let me touch you to make sure that you
ar isobel
veri well she said and stretch out a hand toward him
he caught it with hi left which wa nearest and then with hi right
hand reach forward and seiz her other hand with a master
movement he draw her toward him and though she wa a strong woman she
seem to have no power to resist she thought that he wa go to
kiss her and did not care greatli if he did
but he check himself in time and instead of press hi lip upon
her onli kiss her hand first on and then the other for quit a
long while nor did she attempt to deni him perhap becaus a wild
impuls took possess of her to kiss hi in answer ye hi hand
or hi lip or even hi coat or anyth about him oh it made her
veri angri but there it wa for someth rush up in her which she
had never felt befor someth mad and wild and sweet
she wrench herself awai at last and began to scold him again
what have you been do all these year why did you never write to
me
becaus i wa too proud as you never wrote to me
too proud pride will be your ruin it goe befor everi sort of fall
besid i did write to you i can show you a copi of the letter if i
havent torn it up
i never got it did you post it yourself
ye that is i took it to the abbei hous and left it to be address
there
oh then perhap it is there still and he look at her
nonsens no on could have been so mean not even
he shrug hi shoulder a trick he had learn abroad then said
well it doesnt matter now doe it isobel
ye it matter a lot year of misunderstand and doubt and loss
when life is so short i might have marri or all sort of thing
what ha my not receiv your letter got to do with that he ask
astonish
noth at all why do you ask such silli question i onli meant that
if i had marri i should not have been here and we should never have
met again
well you ar here and we have met in thi church where we part
ye it odd isnt it i wish it had been somewher els i dont
like thi gloomi old place with it atmospher of death come outsid
thei went and when thei were through the churchyard gate walk at
hazard toward the stream which ran through the ground of hawk hall
here thei sat down upon a fallen willow watch the swallow skim
over the surfac of the placid water and for a while were silent
thei had so much to sai to each other that it seem as though scarc
thei knew where to commenc
tell me she said at length were you in the squar garden on the
night of that danc at which i came out oh i see by your look that
you were then why did you not speak to me instead of stand behind a
bush watch in that mean fashion
i wasnt properli dress for parti andandy seem to
beveri much engagedwith a rose and a knight in armour
engag it wa onli part of a game i wrote and told you all about it
in the letter you did not get did you never kiss a flower for a joke
and give it to someon not know that you were be watch
godfrei colour and shift uneasili on hi log
well as a matter of fact he said it is odd that you should have
guessedfor someth of the sort did onc happen quit by accid
also i wa watch
iyou mean we on doesnt kiss flower by oneself and give them
to the air it would be more ridicul even than the other thing
i will tell you all about it if you like he stammer confusedli
she look at him with her larg steadi grei ey and answer in a
cold voic
no thank you i dont like noth bore me so much as other
peopl silli love affair
baffl in defenc godfrei resort to attack
what ha becom of the knight in armour he ask
he is marri and ha twin i saw the announc of their birth in
the paper yesterdai and what ha becom of the ladi with the flower
for sinc there wa a flower there must have been a ladi i suppos
the same whom you pull up the precipic
she is marri also to her cousin but i dont know that she ha ani
children yet and i never pull her up ani precipic it wa a man i

which wa beat with unusu strength thi night as she did so in
that mysteri hour which sometim come to us in english summer a
great chang fell upon her when she sat down upon that fallen tree she
wa still a girl and virgin when she rose from it she wa a

godfrei wa late for dinner veri late and what wa wors hi father
had wait for him
i suppos you forgot that i dine at seven not at eight wa hi
cold greet for mr knight a larg eater like mani teetotal
wa on of those peopl who make a fetish of punctual at meal and
alwai grow cross when thei ar hungri
godfrei whose mind had not been steadi by the event of the
afternoon becam confus and repli that he wa extrem sorri but
the fact wa he had met isobel and in talk to her had not notic
the time
isobel exclaim hi father whose voic wa now ici what isobel
i never knew but on father
oh i suppos you mean miss blake i had no idea she wa here inde
i thought she wa still in mexico but doubtless you were better
inform
no father i met her accident she ha return to england
that is obviou godfrei
she ha come down he continu in a hurri to get the hous readi
for sir john who arriv shortli
oh ha she what a strang coincid all the year of our
separ while you were wai she wa awai but within two dai of your
return she return
ye it doe seem odd agre the fluster godfrei but it lucki
isnt it for of cours i am glad to see her again
mr knight finish carv himself a help of beef and let the
knife fall with a clatter into the dish then he said in carefulli
chosen word
you mai think it luckyor well arrangedbut i must differ i tell
you at onc that i consid miss blake a most pernici young woman
and as your father i can onli express the hope that you do not intend
to allow her to reassert her evil influenc over you
godfrei wa about to answer with wrath but chang hi mind and
remain silent so the topic drop but that it stood veri straight
upon it feet in mr knight mind wa clear from the compress of
hi thin lip and the illhumour of hi remark about the cold and
overdon charact of the beef and sundri other household matter as
soon as the meal wa conclud and he had wash it down with a last
glass of water and with a veri wry face thank provid for all that
he had receiv he retir into hi studi and wa seen no more till
prayertim
nor wa he seen then by godfrei who had gone out to smoke hi pipe
sinc hi father could not bear the smell of tobacco in the hous and
wander unconsci toward the hall there he stood gaze at a
light which he knew came from isobel window and lost in thi
unfruit contempl onc more forgot the time when he arriv
home it wa to find the hous in dark and a note in hi father
handwrit on the hall tabl request him to be care to lock the
door as everyon had gone to bed
he went too but could not sleep for strang enough that
disturb of bodi and spirit which had afflict isobel possess him
also it seem wonder to him that he should have found her again
whom he thought to be so utterli lost and grown so sweet and dear how
could he have live all thi while without her he wonder and
anoth thought how could he bear to part with her onc more oh she
wa hi life andwhi should thei part she had not mind when he
kiss her hand at which of cours she might have been angri
inde she left them to be kiss for quit a long while though not
half long enough perhap she did not wish that thei should part
either or perhap she onli desir that thei should be just friend as
befor it seem almost imposs that thei could becom more than
friend even if she care to do so which he could scarc hope
what wa he a young fellow twenti with onli a littl monei and all
hi wai to make in the world and what wa she a grand young ladi
rather younger than himself it wa true but seem year older who
wa a great heiress thei said and expect to marri a lord someon
born with a silver spoon in hi mouth whose fortun had been made for
him by other peopl moreov hi father hate her becaus their
religi view were differ and her father hate him or us to
for other reason
ye it wa quit impossibleand yet natur seem to take no account
of that natur seem to tell him that it wa absolut possibl and
inde right and what she natur wish also thi same persist
natur seem to suggest to him that isobel wa her most will and
obedi pupil and that perhap if he could look into her heart he
would find that she did care and veri much more than for the wealth
and the hypothet lord
natur seem to suggest too that isobel thought were with him at
that moment that she wa uncommonli near to him in soul if not in
bodi that she wa think about him as he wa think about her and
sai much the same thing to herself as he wa sai to himself
inde he even began a whisper convers with her of a sort he
would not have ventur upon had she been there paus between the
sentenc for her answer which as he imagin them were veri
satisfactori inde
by degre howev question and answer grew less frequent and further
apart as he doze off and final sank into a deep sleep so deep wa
it inde that he wa awaken onli by the clamour of the breakfast
bell and when he arriv downstair to be confront by some cold
bacon on an uncov dish hi father had depart to the diocesan
confer well thi fact had it consol and bacon howev
cold with content is better than bacon hot where content is
so he at it and anyth els he could find with appetit and then
went upstair to shave and do hi hair nice and to put on a new suit
of cloth which he consid becam him also as he had still
threequart of an hour to spare he began to write a littl poem
about isobel which wa a dismal failur to tell the truth sinc he
could think of no satisfactori rhyme to her name except o well
which howev he put it sound silli
at last rather too earli he threw the sheet of paper into the
fireplac and start onli to find that although it still lack a
quarter of an hour to eleven isobel wa alreadi seat on that tree
what have you been do to yourself she ask put on those
smart london cloth i like the old grei thing you had on last night
ever so much better and i want you to climb a tree to get me some
young jackdaw andgood graciou godfrei your head smell like a
whole hairdress shop pleas come to the other side to leeward of
me
he murmur someth about like to look tidi and then remark that
she seem rather fine dress herself
it onli my mexican hat she answer touch the big sombrero
woven from the finest panama grass which she wa wear and the
necklac is made of littl gold aztec idol that were found in a grave
thei ar veri rare a gentleman gave them to me and afterward i wa
horrifi to find that he had paid an aw lot for them 200 i
believ do you understand about the aztec god if not i will explain
them all to you thi big on in the middl is huitzilcoatl the god
of
no no interrupt godfrei i dont and i dont want to i think
them veri ugli and i alwai understood that ladi did not accept such
expens present from gentlemen who wa he
an american millionair who didnt wear armour she answer blandli
then she chang the subject with the origin remark that the swallow
were fly higher than thei had done on the previou even when
thei look as though on could almost catch them with on hand
godfrei reflect to himself that other thing which had seem quit
close on the previou night were now like the swallow far out of
reach onli he took comfort in the remembr that swallow howev
near ar evas bird not easi to seiz unless you can find them
sleep next she began to tell him all about the mexican god
whether he want to listen or not and he sat there in the glori of
hi new cloth and brilliantin hair and gaze at her till she ask
him to desist as she felt as though she were be mesmeris
thi led him to hi spiritualist experi of which he told her all
the stori and by the time it wa finish behold it wa the luncheon
hour
it is veri interest she said as thei enter the hall and i
cant laugh at it all as i should have done onc i dont quit know
why but i hope godfrei that you will have no more to do with
spirit
no not while and he look at her
while what
whilether ar such nice bodi in the world he stammer
colour
she colour also toss her head and went to wash her hand
the afternoon thei spent in hunt for imaginari young jackdaw in a
total nebul tree isobel grew rather cross over it nondiscoveri
swear that she rememb it well year ago and that there were
alwai young jackdaw there

so as to make it up to date and scientif and profit and all the
rest of it also if it hasnt there would have been no young jackdaw

then why couldnt you sai that at onc instead of make us wast all
thi time ask isobel with indign
i dont know repli godfrei in a somewhat vacuou fashion it wa
all the same to me if we were hunt for young jackdaw or the man in
the moon as long as we were togeth

best of todai for who know what tomorrow mai bring forth
who inde certainli not either of these young peopl
thei talk awhil seat by the river then began to walk through
certain ancient graze ground where the monk us to run their
cattl their convers fluent enough at first grew somewhat
constrain and artifici sinc both of them were think of matter
differ from those that thei were try to dress out in word
intim press burn matter that seem to devour their
intellig of everydai with a kind of eat fire thei grew almost
silent talk onli at random and listen to the beat of their
own heart rather than to the word that fell from each other lip
the sky cloud over and some heavi drop of rain began to fall
i suppos that we must go in said isobel we shall be soak
present and she glanc at her light summer attir
where exclaim godfrei the abbei no my father will be back by
now it must be the hall
veri well but i dare sai my father is there by now for i

which i thought perhap might interest you and i dont know when i

then why did you not tell your stori befor she inquir with some
irrit
oh becaus i have onli just thought of it he repli rather wildli
at thi moment thei were pass the church and the rain began to fall
in earnest by some mutual impuls thei enter through the chancel
door which wa alwai unlock and by some mutual folli left it open
advanc instinct to the tomb of the unknown plantagenet ladi
and her knight which were so intim connect with the littl
event of their littl live thei listen for a while to the rush of
the rain upon the leaden roof sai noth till the silenc grew
irksom inde each wait for the other to break it but with a
woman infinit patienc isobel wait the longer there she stood
stare at the brass of the plantagenet ladi still as the bone of
that ladi which lai beneath
my stori said godfrei at last with a gasp and stop
ye said isobel what is it
oh he exclaim in an agoni a veri short on i love you that
all
a littl quiver ran through her caus her dress to shake and the
gold mexican god on her necklac to tinkl against each other then
she grew still as a stone and rais those larg and steadi ey of
her look him up and down final fix them upon hi own
is that true she ask
true it is as true as life and death or as heaven and hell
i dont know anyth about heaven and hell thei ar hypothet
ar thei not life and death ar enough for me and she stop
then by life and death for life and death and for ever i love you
isobel
thank you she said and stop onc more
you dont help on much have you noth to sai
what is there to sai you made a statement for which i thank you
you ask no question
it is a question he exclaim indignantli if i love you of cours
i want to know if you love me
then why did you not sai so but she ad veri deliber sinc
you want to know i do and alwai have and alwai shall in life or
deathand for everif that mean anyth
he stare at her tri to utter someth and fail then he fell
back upon anoth veri primit and ancient expedi fling hi
arm about her he press her to hi heart and kiss her again and
again and again nor in her moment of complet surrend did she
scrupl to kiss him back
it wa while thei were thu engag offer a wonder spectacl of
love triumphant and rejoic in it triumph that anoth person who
wa pass the church bethought him of it shelter as a refug from
the pour rain see the open door mr knight for it wa he
slip into the great build in hi quiet rather catlik fashion
but on it threshold saw and stop notwithstand the shadow he
recognis them in a moment more the sight of thi pair the son whom
he dislik and the woman whom he hate thu embrac thu lost in a
sea of passion move him to white furi so that he lift hi clench
hand abov hi head and shook them mutter
and in my church my church
then unabl to bear more of thi spectacl he slip awai again
heedless of the pour ski
by natur although in obedi to a rash promis onc he had marri
mr knight wa a true womanhat that sex and everyth to do with
it were repel to him even the most harmless manifest of
natur affect between male and femal he consid disgust
inde indec and if these were carri ani further he held it to be
among the greatest of crime he wa on of those who if he had the
power would have hound ani poor girl who in the countri phrase
had got into troubl to the river brink and over it as a creatur
not fit to live or if she escap destruct would have and inde
often had pursu her with unceas malign think that therebi
he did god servic hi attitud toward such a person wa that of an
inquisitor toward a fallen nun
moreov he could do thi with a clear conscienc sinc he could
truli sai that he wa qualifi to throw the first stone be of
those who mistak person avers for person virtu becaus hi
coldheart natur reject it he loath thi kind of human fail
and felt good in the loath nor did it ever occur to him to reflect
that other such as secret malic jealousi and all uncharit
on which hi heart fed might be much wors than the outrush of human
passion in obedi to the almighti decre of natur that is
determin not to die
these be hi view the feel that the sight awok in him of thi
pair declar their holi love in the accustom human fashion can
scarc be measur and ar certainli beyond descript had he been
anoth sort of man who had found some devil flog a child to death
the rage and indign arous in hi breast could not have been
greater even if it were hi own child
the on thing that mr knight had fear for year wa that godfrei
who as he knew wa fonder of isobel than of ani other live
creatur should come to love her in a fuller fashion isobel a girl
who had laugh at and flout him and onc told him to hi face that a
studi of hi charact and treatment of other had done more to turn
her from the christian religion than anyth els
in a sens he wa unselfish in thi matter or rather hi hate master
hi selfish he knew veri well that isobel would be a great match
for godfrei and he wa by no mean a man who underr monei and
posit and their power he guess too that she realli love him
and would have made him the best of wive that with her at hi side he
might do almost anyth in the world but these consider did not
in the least soften hi loath of the veri thought of such a
marriag incred as it mai seem he would rather have seen godfrei
dead than the happi husband of isobel
mr knight drunk with rage reel rather than walk awai from the
church door wonder what he might do to baulk and shame that live
love pair who could kiss and cling even among the tomb a thought
came to him a veri evil thought which he welcom as an inspir
sent straight from an offend heaven sir john blake had come home he
knew it for he had pass him on the road seat alon in a fine
motorcar and thei had wave their hand to each other not ten minut
befor he would go and tell him all in the charact of an upright
man who doe not like to see hi rich neighbour harm by the
entangl of that neighbour daughter in an undesir
relationship that sir john would consid himself to be harm he wa
sure enough be by no mean ignor of hi plan and aspir
for the futur of that daughter who wa expect to make a great
allianc in return for the fortun which she would bring to her husband
no sooner said than done in three minut he wa at the hall and as
it chanc met sir john by the front door
hullo reverend how ar you you look veri wet and miser take
refug from the rain i suppos though it is clear off now have a
brandi and soda or a glass of port
thank you sir john i am an abstain but a cup of hot tea would be
welcom
teaah ye but that take time to make so i should have to leav
you to drink it by yourself fact is i want to find my daughter some
of those bless guest of mine includ mounteroi the young earl
you know whom i wish her to meet particularli ar come down
tonight by the last train and not tomorrow so i must get everyth
arrang in a hurri cant make out where the girl ha gone
i think i can tell you sir john said mr knight with a sickli
smile at least i saw her a littl while ago rather peculiarli
engag
where and how wa she engag
without ask permiss mr knight enter the hous and step into
a cloakroom that open out of the hall be curiou sir john
follow him mr knight shut the door and support himself against
the frame of a marbl washbasin with gild tap said
i saw her in the chancel of the abbei church and she wa kiss my
son godfrei at least he wa kiss her and she seem to be
respond to hi infam advanc for her arm were round hi neck
and i heard sound which suggest that thi wa so
holi mose ejacul sir john what in the name of hell ar thei
after
your question strip of it unnecessari and profan explet
seem easi to answer i imagin that my immor son ha just propos
to your daughter and been accept withwel unusu emphasi
perhap you ar right but if he had i dont see anyth particularli
immor about it if i had never done anyth wors than that i
shouldnt feel myself call to go upon my knee and cry peccavi
howev that aint the point the point is that a game of thi sort
dont at all suit my book but here he look at the clergyman
shrewdli why do you come to tell about it i should have thought
that under all the circumst you should have been glad isobel
isnt like to be exactli a beggar you know so it seem devilish
queer that you should object as i gather you do unless it is to the
kiss which ha been heard of befor
i do object most strongli sir john repli mr knight in hi iciest
tone i disapprov entir of your daughter whose lack of ani
christian feel is notori and whose corrupt influenc will i
fear make my son as bad as herself
damn her lack of christian feel and damn your and your impud
too you halfdrown church rat why dont you call her jezebel at
onc and have done with it on of the thing i like about her is that
she ha the pluck to snap her finger at such as you and all your
ignor superstit what ar you get at that is what i want to
know
i put asid your insult to which as a clergyman it is my duti to turn
the other cheek repli mr knight with a furiou gasp as to the
rest i am try to get at the pure and sacr truth
you look as though you would do better to get at the pure and sacr
brandi remark sir john survei him critic but that your
affair now what is the truth
ala that i must sai it i believ my son to be that basest of
creatur a fortunehunt how did he get that monei left to him by
anoth woman
dont know im sure perhap the old girl found the young chap
attract and wish to acknowledg favour receiv such thing
have been known you dont suppos he forg her will do you
you ar ribald sir ribald
am i well and you ar jolli offens thank god you werent my
father now from what i rememb of that boi of your i shouldnt
have thought that he wa a fortunehunt i should have thought that
he wa a young beggar who wish to get hold of the girl he fanci
and that all still you know him best and i dare sai you ar right
anywai for your own peculiar and crackbrain reason you dont want
thi busi and i sai at onc you cant want it less than i do do
you suppos that i wish to see my onli child who will have half a
million of monei and might be a countess or half a dozen countess
tomorrow marri to the son of a beggarli snivel like you for as
you ar so fond of the pure and sacr truth ill give it youa
fellow who can come and peach upon your own boi and hi girl
my conscienc and my duti began mr knight
oh drat your conscienc and blow your duti your a spy and a
backbit telltal that what you ar did you never kiss a girl
yourself
never until after i wa marri when we ar special enjoin by the
great apostl
then im sorri for your wife for she must have had a lot to teach
you but let stop slang we have our own opinion of each other
and there an end now we have both the same object you becaus you
ar a piou crank and no more human than a dri eel and i becaus i
am a man of the world who want to see my daughter where she ought to
be wear a coronet in the hous of lord the question is how is
the job to be done you dont understand isobel but i do if her back
is put up wild hors wont move her shed snap her finger in my
face and tell me to go to a place that you ar better acquaint with
than i am or will be and take my monei with me of cours i could
hold her for a few month till she is of ag perhap but after that
no so it seem that the onli chanc is your son now what hi weak
point can he be bought off
certainli not said mr knight
oh that odd in on who you sai is a fortunehunt well what is
it everyon ha a weak point and anoth girl wont do just now
hi weakest point is hi fond for that treacher and abomin
sex of which i have just had so pain an exampl and in the church
too ye in my church
and a jolli good place to get to in such a rain for of cours thei
didnt know that you were hide under the pew but iv told you that
cock wont fight at present what the next
at these accumul insult mr knight turn perfectli livid with
suppress rage but he did suppress it for he had an object to gain
which to hi pervert mind wa the most import in the whole
worldnam the final separ of hi son and isobel
hi next bad point he went on is hi pride which is abnorm
although from childhood i have done my best to inculc humil of
spirit into hi heart he cannot bear ani affront or even neglect for
instanc he left me for some year just becaus he did not consid
that he wa receiv properli on hi return from switzerland also
becaus he went into a rage for he ha a veri evil temper if rous
when i suggest that he want to run after your daughter monei
well it wasnt a veri nice thing to sai wa it but i think i see
light he proud is he and dont like allus to fortunehunt
all right ill rub hi nose in the dirt and make him good im just
the boi for a job of that sort as perhap you will agre my reverend
friend and if he show hi air to me ill kick him off the premis
come on i dare sai we shall find them still in the church where thei
think themselv so snug although the rain ha stop
so thi preciou pair start each of them bent though for differ
reason upon as evil a mission as the mind of man can conceiv for
what is there more wick than to wish to bring about the separ
and subsequ miseri of two young peopl who as thei guess well
enough love each other bodi and soul and therebi to spoil their
live yet so strang is human natur that neither of them thought
that thei were commit ani sin mr knight now and afterward
justifi himself with the reflect that he wa part hi son from
a pernici young woman of strong charact who would probabl lead
him awai from religion as it wa understood by him on also whom he
look upon as the worst of outcast who deserv and doubtless wa
destin to inhabit hell becaus hastili she had reject hi form of
faith as the young ar apt to do for reason howev hollow that
seem to her suffici
he took no account of hi bitter secret jealousi of thi girl who as
he thought had estrang hi son from him and prevent him from
carri out hi cherish plan of make of him a clergyman like
himself or of hi innat physic hatr of women which caus him to
desir that godfrei should remain celib these motiv although he
wa well awar of them he set down as naught be quit sure in
view of the good of hi aim that thei would be overlook or even
commend by the power abov whom he pictur in hi mind ey as a
furiou old man anim chiefli by jealousi and a desir to wreak
vengeanc on and tortur the helpless for it is the lesson of the old
testament that sink most deepli into the soul of mr knight and hi
kind
sir john end were quit differ he wa the veri vulgarest of
selfmad men coars and brutal by natur a sensualist of the type
that is untouch by imagin a man who would crush anyon who
stood in hi path without compunct just becaus that person did
stand in hi path but he wa extrem shrewdwit the wai he saw
through mr knightand in hi own fashion veri ablewit hi
success in life
moreov sinc a man of hi type ha gener some object beyond the
mere acquir of monei particularli after it ha been acquir he
had hi to rise high for he wa veri ambiti hi natur
discern set all hi own fail befor him in the clearest light
also their consequ he knew that he wa vulgar and brutal and
that as a result all person of real gentil look down upon him
howev much thei might seem to cring befor hi monei and power ye
though thei chanc to be but labour men
for instanc hi wife had done so which wa on of the reason why he
hate her as inde had all her distinguish rel after thei
came to know him although he lent them monei he knew that even if he
becam a peer as he fulli expect to do it would be the same stori
outward defer and lip servic but inward dislik and contempt in
short there were limit which he could never hope to pass and
therefor so far as he wa concern hi ambiti thirst must remain
unslak
but he had a daughter whom natur perhap becaus of her mother
blood had set in quit a differ class she had hi abil but she
wa gentleborn which he wa not on who could mix with and be
welcom by the highest in the world and thi without the slightest
question if not beauti she wa veri distinguish she had
presenc and what the french call the air further she would be on
of the richest women in england consid from hi point of view
therefor it wa but natur that he should desir her to make a
brilliant marriag and found a great famili which he would thu have
originatedat ani rate to some extent night and dai he long that
thi should come about and it wa the reason why the young lord
mounteroi wa visit hawk hall
mounteroi had met isobel at a dinnerparti in london the other dai and
admir her he had told an old ladya kind of societi toutwho had
repeat it to sir john that he wish to get marri and that isobel
blake wa the sort of girl he would like to marri he wa a clever man
also ambiti on who had hope of some dai rule the countri but
to do thi he need behind him great and assur fortun in addit
to hi ancient but somewhat impoverish rank in short she suit hi
book and he suit that of sir john now the thing to do wa to bring
it about that he should also suit isobel book and just at the
critic moment thi accurs accid had happen oh it wa too
much
no wonder that sir john wa fill with righteou wrath and a stern
determin to make thing hot for the caus of the accid as
led to the attack by the activ but drip mr knight whom he
design in hi heart as that littl cur of a parson much as an
overf and bloat bloodhound might be by some black and viciou
mongrel he tramp heavili toward the church inde thei made a
queer contrast thi small activ but fiercefac man in hi sombr
shini garment and dingi white tie and the huge amplepaunch
baronet with hi red flat face heavi lip and project but
intellig ey cloth in a new suit wear an enorm black
pearl in hi neckti and a diamond ring on hi finger the veri ideal
of mammon in everi detail of hi person and of hi carefulli advertis
opul
isobel whose humour had it sardon side and who wa the first to
catch sight of them when thei reach the church mr knight trip
ahead and sir john hot with the exercis in the close moist air
lumber after him with hi mouth open compar them in her mind to a
fierc littl pilot fish conduct an overf shark to some helpless
prei which it had discov battl with the water of circumst
that after all wa onli anoth version of the mongrel and the
bloodhound also she compar them to other thing even less
complimentari
yet none of these perhap wa realli adequ either to the evil
intent or the repel appear of thi pair as thei advanc
upon their wick mission of jealousi and hate
chapter xvi
love and loss
all unawar that thei had been seen and by no friendli ey godfrei
and isobel remain embrac each other for quit a long while at
length she wrench herself awai and sink on to a chancel bench
motion to him to seat himself besid her
let us talk she said in a new voic a strang voic that wa low
and rich such as he had never heard her us let us talk my dear
what of he ask almost in a whisper as he took hi place and her
hand which he held against hi beat heart my soul ha been
talk to your for the last five minut or is it five second or
five year it doe not seem to have anyth more to sai
yet i think there is plenti to be said godfrei do you know that
while we were kiss each other there some veri queer idea got hold
of me not onli of the sort which might be expect in our case you
rememb that plantagenet ladi who li buri beneath where we were
stand she whose dress i onc copi to wear at the ball when i came
out
dont speak of that he interrupt for then you were kiss
someon els
it is not true i never kiss anyon els in that wai and i do not
think i ever shall i kiss a rose that all and i gather that you
have done as much and veri like a great deal more but it is of the
ladi i am speak not of the ball she seem to come up from her
grave and enter into me and sai someth
well what did she sai isobel he ask dreamili
that it i dont know although she talk to me as on might to
oneself all i know is that it wa of troubl and patienc and great
joi and war and tragedi in which i must be intim concern
andaft the tragedyof a most infinit rest and bliss
i expect she wa tell you her own stori which seem to have end
well he repli in the same dreami fashion
ye i think so but also that she meant that her stori would be my
stori copi you know as i copi her dress of cours it is all
nonsens just the influenc of the place take hold of me when
overcom by other thing but at the time it seem veri real
so doe a bad dream said godfrei but for all that it isnt real
still it is odd that everyth import seem to happen to us within
a few feet of that ladi dust and i cant quit disbeliev in spirit
and their power of impress themselv upon us i wish i could the
strang thing is that you should put ani faith in them
i dont though i admit that my view about such matter ar chang
you know i us to be sure that when we die everyth is over with us
now i think differ why i cannot sai
then the subject drop becaus realli thei were both wrap in the
great joi of a gloriou hour and disinclin to dwell upon fanci
about a woman who had di five hundr year ago or on metaphys
specul also the fear of what might follow upon that hour haunt
them more vividli than ani hover ghost if such there were
my dear said isobel i am sorri but i must sai it i am sure that
there will be troubl about thi busi
no doubt isobel there alwai is troubl at least where i am
concern also on cant be happi without pai but what doe it
matter so long as we stick to each other soon we shall both be of ag
and can do what we like
on alwai think that godfrei and yet somehow on never can free

therefor cannot be separ for alwai whatev happen for a while
as i am sure that someth will happen which will make you leav me
i swear that i will never leav you i will die with you first he
exclaim spring up

i swear that i will alwai love you he went on
ah now i believ you dear she broke in again howev badli you
mai behav you will alwai love me becaus you must

differ no not if thei were both to join forc and try their
best but that doe not mean that necessarili we shall marri each
other for i think that peopl who love like that rare do marri
becaus you see thei would be too happi which someth is alwai
try to prevent it mai mean howev she ad reflect that
we shall not marri anybodi els though even that might happen in your
casenot in mine alwai rememb godfrei that i shall never marri
anybodi els not even if you took three wive on after the other
three wive gasp godfrei

meannot from ani particular virtu but just becaus i couldnt you
see it would make me ill and if i tri i should onli run awai
oh stop talk nonsens said godfrei when so soon you will have
to go to see about those peopl and he held out hi arm
she sank into them and for a littl while thei forgot their doubt and
fear
the rain had ceas and the triumphant sun shine glorious through
the west window of stain glass pour it rai upon them dye
them all the colour of an angel wing also incident it made
them extrem conspicu in that duski church of which thei had all
thi while forgotten to shut the door
my word said sir john to mr knight in tone of savag sarcasm as
thei survei the two through thi door weve got here just at the
right time dont thei look pretti and dont you wish that you were
hi ag and that wa someon els daughter i tell you i do
mr knight gurgl someth in hi inarticul wrath for at that
moment he hate isobel father as much as he did isobel which wa
sai a great deal
well my pretti pair of coo turtledov went on sir john in a
sort of shout address himself to them be so good as to stop that
or i think i shall wring both your neck damn you
not in thi holi hous which these infam and shameless person
have desecr with their profan embrac interrupt mr knight
ye accord to your idea it will be almost a case of
reconsecr youll have to write to the bishop about it mr
parson oh confound you dont stand there like a coupl of stuck
pig but come out of that and let us have a littl chat in the
churchyard
now at the first word that reach their ear godfrei and isobel had
drawn back from each other and stood side by side quit still befor
the altar as a pair about to be marri might do
thei were dumbfound and no wonder as might be expect isobel wa
the first to recov herself
come my dear she said in a clear voic to godfrei my father and
your wish to speak to us i am glad we have a chanc of explain
matter so soon
ye said godfrei but in a wrath voic for he felt anger
stir in him perhap it wa excit by that ancient instinct which
caus the male anim to resent the spy upon him when he is
court hi femal as the deadliest of all possibl insult or
perhap by some prescienc of affront which were about to be offer
to him and isobel by these two whom he knew to be bitterli hostil at
least hi temper wa rise and like most rather gentlenatur men
when realli provok and corner he could be danger
ye he repeat let us go out and see thi matter through
so thei went sir john and mr knight draw back a littl befor
them till thei were brought to a halt by the horribl memori which
the former had erect over hi wife grave here thei stood prepar
for the encount sir john wa the first to take the list sai
perhap you will explain isobel why i found you as i thought
kiss thi young fellowlik ani villag slut beneath a hedg
isobel big ey grew steeli as she answer
for the same reason father like your villag slut i kiss thi man
becaus he is my lover whom i mean to marri if as i gather you ar
not certain as to what you saw i will kiss him again here in front of
you
i have no doubt you will just like your cheek ejacul sir john
taken a littl aback
then mr knight took up the ball address himself to hi son
could you find no other place for your immor perform except the
church godfrei and my chancel too
no answer godfrei becaus it wa rain and we shelter there
and what do you mean by your talk about immor is it not law
for a man to love a woman i should have thought that the bibl which
you ar alwai quot would have taught you otherwis also onc you
were marri yourself els i should not be here for which i am not
sure that i thank you at least i shouldnt were it not for isobel
for a moment mr knight could think of no answer to these argument
but sir john have recov hi breath attack again
look here young fellow i have no time to listen to jaw about the
bibl and moral and immor and all that bosh which you can have out
with your reverend parent afterward i am a plain man i am and want
a plain answer to a plain question do you think that you ar go to
marri my daughter isobel
such is my desir and intent repli godfrei with vagu
recollect of the baptism servic though of these at the moment
he wa not awar
oh is it then you ar jolli well mistaken in your desir and
intent let make thing clear you ar a beggarli youngster who
propos to enter the armi at some futur date which you mai or mai not
do and you have the impud to wish to marri on of the biggest
heiress in england against my will
and against mine burst in mr knight who consid her a most
pernici young woman on who reject the christian faith and will
lead you to perdit that is why when i chanc to espi you in such
a compromis posit i hasten to inform the ladi father
oh you did that did you interpos isobel contempl him
steadili well i am glad to know who could have been so cowardli
she ad with wither contempt now i begin to wonder whether a
letter which some year ago i brought to the abbei hous to be
forward to godfrei wa ever post to him who did not receiv it or
whether perhap it fell into the hand ofsomeon like you
it did said mr knight i read it and have it to thi dai in my
discret as a father i did not consid it desir that my young
son should receiv that letter what i have wit thi afternoon
show me how right wa my judgment
thank you so much said isobel that take a great weight off my
mind godfrei my dear i apologis to you for my doubt the truth did
occur to me but i thought it imposs that a clergyman here she
look again at mr knight could be a thief also who did not dare to
own to hi theft
never mind all that went on sir john in hi heavi master voic
it stand like thi you and he point a fat finger at godfrei
arewel ill tell you what you areyour just a cun young
fortunehunt you found out that thi properti and a good bit besid
ar come to isobel and you want to collar the sag like you did that
of the old woman out in lucern well you dont do it my boi iv
other view for isobel do you think i want to see her marri
tototh son of a fellow like thata cant snuffler who prig
letter and split on hi own son and swing the fat finger round
he thrust it almost into the face of mr knight
what did you sai gasp godfrei that i am a fortunehunt
ye that what i said and ill repeat it if you like
then went on godfrei speak in a thick low voic for now hi
temper had master him thoroughli i sai that you ar a liar i sai
that you ar a base and vulgar man who ha made monei somehow and
think that thi justifi him in insult those who ar not base or
vulgar becaus thei have less monei
you infern young scamp shout sir john in a roar like to that of
an angri bull do you dare to call me a liar apologis at onc
or and he stop
i do not apologis i repeat that you ar a liar the greatest liar i
ever met nowor what
thu spoke godfrei draw up hi tall slim young form to it full
height hi dark ey flash hi fine face alight with righteou
rage isobel who wa stand quit still and smile a littl rather
contemptu look at him out of the corner of her ey and
thought that anger becam him well never befor had he seem so
handsom to her approv judgment
or thi bellow sir john and lift the tightli roll umbrella
he carri he struck godfrei with all hi strength upon the side of
the head
godfrei stagger but fortun the soft hat he wa wear upon
the brim of which the stroke fell broke it weight to some extent so
that he wa not realli hurt onli now he went quit mad in a kind of
ici wai and spring at sir john with the light of a leopard
dealt him two blow on with hi left hand and the next with hi right
thei were good straight blow for box had been hi favourit
amus at sandhurst where he wa a middleweight champion the first
caught sir john upon hi thick lip which were badli cut against the
teeth caus him to stagger while the second that with the right
land on the bridg of hi nose and black both hi ey thi so
strong and heavi wa it notwithstand sir john great weight
knock him clean off hi feet back he went and in hi effort to
save himself grip mr knight with on hand and with the other the
leg of the earli victorian angel that surmount ladi jane grave
against which thei were stand neither of these could withstand the
strain the angel which wa onli pin by leadcoat rivet to it
base and the column behind flew from it support as did mr knight
from hi so that in anoth second the men have trip against the
surround of the grave all three roll upon the path the marbl
luckili fall clear of both of them
now iv done it said godfrei in a reflect voic as he
contempl the tangl ruin
ye exclaim isobel i think you have
then thei remain grim and silent while the pair who were not realli
much injur pick themselv up with groan
i am sorri that i knock you down sinc i am young and you ar not
said godfrei but i repeat that you ar a liar he ad by an
afterthought
sir john spat out a tooth and began to mop the blood from hi nose
with a silk pockethandkerchief
oh you do do you he said in a somewhat subdu voic well
youll find out that im other thing too befor im done with you and
i repeat that you ar fortunehunt young rascal and that i would
rather see my daughter dead than marri to you
and i sai godfrei i would rather see you dead than marri to her
broke in mr knight spit out hi word like an angri cat
i dont think that you need be afraid father answer godfrei
quietli although hi rage burn as fierc as ever you have work

listen sir john blake not even for the sake of isobel will i submit
to such insult i will not give her up but i swear by god that while
you ar aliv i will not marri isobel nor will i write to her or speak
to her again after you ar dead which i dare sai will be befor so
veri long and he survei the huge puffyflesh baronet with a
critic ey thenif she care to wait for mei will marri her
hope that in the meanwhil you mai lose your monei or dispos of it
as you like
sir john stare still mop hi face but find no word he
fear death veri much and thi propheci of it spoken with such a ring
of truth as though the speaker knew frighten him at that moment in
hi heart he curs the reverend mr knight and hi talebear and
wish most earnestli that he had never been led into interfer with
thi matter after all godfrei wa a fine young man whom hi daughter
care for and might do well in life and he had struck him first after
offer him intent and prearrang insult such were the
thought that flash through hi somewhat muddl brain also anoth
that thei were too late the evil wa done and never could be undon
then isobel spoke in cold clear tone sai
godfrei is quit right and ha been right all through had you
father and that man and she point contemptu at mr knight
left us alon we should have come and told you what had happen
between us and if you disapprov we would have wait until we were
of full ag and have marri as we should have been free to do but now
that is imposs for blow have pass between you after slander
him vile you struck godfrei first father and he would not have
been a man if he had not struck you back inde i should have thought
littl of him afterward well he ha made an oath and i know that he

let me go my wai in ani case if i should surviv you and should
godfrei live i will marri him after your death even if we have to
wait until we ar old to do so as to your fortun i care noth for

she paus as though for an answer but none came for if sir john had
been frighten befor now he wa terrifi of thi outrag young
woman who tall command and sternei look to him like an
aveng angel
there doesnt seem much more to sai doe there she went on except
that i think father you had better telegraph to your guest that you

quit lost to view he spoke to the two men who still stood irresolut
befor him

mind ye he shout after him there more young women in the world
than ye meet in an afternoon walk and on nail drive anoth out
as be a smith by trade i know well
godfrei bundl into an empti carriag with hi portmanteau and hi
coat and cover hi face with hi hand that he might see no more of
that accurs station whenc he seem alwai to be depart in
troubl so everyth had been overheard and seen and doubtless the
stori would travel far and wide poor isobel
as a matter of fact it did but it wa not isobel who suffer sinc
public sympathi wa strong on the side of her and of her lover the
indign of the neighbourhood concentr itself upon the squar
and the parson especi the latter inde the villag show it
sympathi with the victim and it wrath with the oppressor by go
on strike few beater turn up at sir john next shoot parti and
on the follow sundai mr knight preach to empti bench a vacuum
that continu from week to week the end of it wa he becam so
unpopular and hi strain relat with sir john grew so notori
that the bishop who like everyon els knew the whole stori gentli
suggest to him that a chang of live would be to hi advantag
also to that of the church in monk acr and it neighbourhood
so mr knight depart to anoth parish in a remot part of the
dioces which have been inund by the sea wa almost devoid of
inhabit and saw the abbei and hawk hall no more
in search hi pocket for match godfrei found the letter which
had been given to him as he left the abbei he knew the write on the
envelop at onc and wa mind not to open it for thi and the
foreign stamp told him that it came from madam rienn still
curios or a desir to take hi mind off the miseri by which it

she cannot harm becaus of the influenc round him still
prevent her from return to switzerland where she ha friend
now that big plum it is veri nice and you desir it much come to

godfreywel perhap i will tell you the rest anoth time you
poor silli boi who will not understand that the more you get the
more you will alwai have
your godmamma who love you still although you treat her so badli
the countess of rienn
ah you did not know i had that titl did you but in the
speerit world i have other which ar much higher
godfrei thrust thi preciou epistl back into hi pocket with a
feel of physic and mental sick how did thi horribl woman
know so much about him and hi affair and why did she prophesi such
dread thing further if her knowledg wa so accur although
veil in her foreign metaphor why should not her propheci be
accur also and if thei were why should he be call upon to suffer
so mani thing
he could find no answer to these question but afterward he sent her
letter to the pasteur who in due cours return it with some upright
and manli comment both upon the epistl itself and the stori of hi
troubl which godfrei had detail to him amongst much els he wrote
in french
you suffer and cannot understand why my dear boi nor do i but
it is truth that all who ar worth anyth ar call upon to
suffer to what end we do not know noth of valu is gain
except by suffer why again we do not know thi wretch
woman is right in a wai when she refer all solut to anoth
world onli her other world is on that is bad and her
solut ar veri base be sure that there ar other and better
on that we shall learn in due time when thi littl sun ha set
for us for it will rise elsewher godfrei in a brighter sky
meanwhil do not be frighten by her threat for even if thei
should all be true to those evil which she prophesi there is
be sure anoth interpret as i think on of your poet ha
said we add our figur until thei come even so go your wai and
keep as upright as you can and have no fear sinc god is over
all not the devil
thu preach the pasteur and what he said gave godfrei the greatest
comfort still be young he made on mistak he did send madam
rienn some monei partli out of pityten pound in a postal order
without ani cover letter a folli that did not tend to a cessat
of her epistolatori effort
on reach town godfrei went straight to hampstead there to hi
surpris he found all prepar for hi recept
i wa expect you my dear said mr parson and even have a
littl bit extra in the hous in case you should come
why when i told you i had gone home for a month ask godfrei
why for the same reason as i know that oil and vinegar wont abid
mix in the same bottl i wa sure enough that be a man grown you
and your father could never get on togeth in on hous but perhap
there is someth els in it too she ad doubtfulli
then godfrei told her that there wa someth els and inde all
about the busi
well there you ar and there noth to be said or at least so
much that it come to the same thing remark mr parson in a
reflect tone when he had finish hi stori but what i want to
know she went on is why these kind of thing happen you twoi
mean you and miss isobelar just fit to each other appoint
togeth by natur so to speak and fond as a coupl of dove upon a
perch so why shouldnt you take each other and have done what is
there to come between a young man and a young woman such as you ar
i dont know groan godfrei
no nor dont i and yet someth doe come between what the
mean of it all why do thing alwai go cuss in thi er world
is there a devil about what manag it or is it just chanc why
shouldnt peopl have what thei want and when it want instead of
be forc to wait until perhap it isnt or cant be enjoi or
often enough to lose it altogeth you cant answer and nor cant i
onli at time i do think notwithstand all my christian teach
and hundr and hundr of your father sermon that the devil
he topdog here and as for that there foreign woman whose letter
youv read to me she hi housemaid not but what im sure it will
all come right at last she ad with an attempt at cheer
i hope so repli godfrei without convict and went to bed
present he descend from hi room again bear a pillbox in which
wa enclos a certain ring that year befor he had bought at lucern
a ring set with two heart of turquois
i promis not to write he said but you might address thi to her
shell know what it is for i told her about it
ye said mr parson the young ladi shall have that box of pill
be upset it mai do her good
in due cours isobel did have it also the box came back address to
mr parson in it wa anoth ring a simpl band of ancient golda
a matter of fact it wa roman a betroth ring of two thousand year
ago round it wa a scrap of paper on which wa written
thi wa dug up in a grave my greatgrandmoth gave it to my
greatgrandfath when thei becam engag about a hundr year
ago and he wore it all hi life as in a bygon ag someon els
had done now the greatgranddaught give it to anoth let him
wear it all hi life whatev happen to her or to him then let
it go to the grave again perhap to be worn by other far
centuri henc
godfrei understood and set it on the third finger of hi left hand
where it remain night and dai and year by year
so that matter end and afterward came silenc and dark which
endur for ten year or more from hi father he heard noth nor on
hi part did he ever write to him again inde the first new
concern him which reach godfrei wa that of hi death which
happen some seven year later appar after a brief ill even
of thi he would not have learn sinc no on took the troubl to put
it in ani paper that he saw had it not chanc that the rev mr
knight di intest and that therefor hi small belong
descend to godfrei as hi natur heir with them were a number of
paper among which in the after dai godfrei found the veri letter
that isobel wrote to him which hi father post in hi desk
for hi son there wa no word a circumst that show the
implac of thi man charact notwithstand hi continu
profess of the highest christian principl he could never forget or
forgiv and thi although it wa he who wa in fault for what wrong
had godfrei done to him in love a woman whom he did not chanc to
like so he di silent bear hi resent to the grave and yet
some odd sens of justic prevent him from rob godfrei of hi
littl inherit someth under two thousand pound that came on a
polici of insur and certain save a sum which in after year
when monei wa plenti with him godfrei appoint to the repair and
beautifi of the abbei church at monk acr
strang enough although from hi childhood thei had been alwai
estrang godfrei felt thi conduct of hi father veri much inde it
seem dread to him that he should vanish thu into the dark
take hi wrath with him and often he wonder if it still anim
him there also he wonder what could be the possibl purpos of it
all and inde why hi father wa so fashion that he could grow
venom over such a matter to all of which question no answer came
although on suggest itself to himnam that he wa the victim of
some hereditari taint and therefor not in fact to blame
in the case of isobel the dark wa equal dens for both of them
kept their word and with the singl except of the episod of the
exchang of ring neither attempt to commun with the other
directli or indirectli from mr parson he heard that hawk hall wa
shut up and that sir john and hi daughter live mostli in london or
at a place that the former had bought in scotland onc inde mr
parson did write or got someon els to write to him that she had
seen isobel drive past her in the street and that she look well
though rather stern and quietlik
that wa all the new godfrei had of isobel dure those ten year
sinc she wa not a person who advertis her movement in the paper
although for her sake he becam a great student of societi gossip also
he read with care all announc of engag and marriag in
the time and the death too for the matter of that but happili
quit without result inde in view of her declar he ought to
have been and in fact wa asham of hi research but then who
could be quit sure of anyth in thi world
sir john he knew wa live becaus from time to time he saw hi
name in list of subscript of a sort that appear under royal
patronag and ar larg advertis
so between these two swung a veil of dark although had he but
known it thi wa not nearli so impenetr to isobel as to himself
somehowposs arthur thorburn had friend with whom he correspond
in england who knew isobelsh acquir inform as to everi detail
of hi career inde when he came to learn everyth he wa
absolut amaz at the particular with which she wa acquaint
whereof there were certain that he would have prefer to have kept to
himself but she had them all with date and surround circumst
and the rest thousand of mile of ocean had been no bar to her
search gaze
for hi part he wa not without consol sinc strang enough
he never felt as if she were lost to him or inde far awai it wa
alwai as though she were in the next room or at ani rate in the next
street there ar individu of sensit mind and he wa on of
them who know well enough when such a total loss ha occur it ha
been well said that the dead ar never realli dead to us until thei ar
forgotten and the same appli to the live while thei rememb us
thei ar never so veri far awai and what is more we or some of us
ar quit awar if thei have ceas to rememb for then the door is
shut and the doorwai built up and our heart tell us that thi ha been
done
in godfrei case with isobel not onli did the doorwai remain
unfilledth door itself wa alwai ajar although sea divid them
and over these no whisper came yet he felt her thought leap to him
across the world especi did thi happen at night when he laid
himself down to sleep perhap becaus then hi mind wa most
recept and sinc their hour of go to rest must have been
differ he be in india and she in england she could scarc
have been reflect on him as he fondli believ at the moment when
she too enter into the world call sleep
therefor either it wa all imagin or he caught her wake
thought or perhap those that haunt her upon thi border land were
delai until hi subtler be could interpret them who know at
least unless someth had happen to disturb him those night were
rare when as he wa shut hi ey godfrei did not seem to be
sensibl of isobel presenc at ani rate he knew that she had not
forgotten he knew that somewher in the vast world she wa ever
think of him with more intens than she thought of ani other man
or thing and dure all those lone year thi knowledg or belief
wa hi greatest comfort
not that godfrei life in india wa in ani wai unhappi on the
contrari it wa a full and activ life he work hard at hi
profess and succeed in it to a limit extent and he had hi
friend especi hi great friend arthur thorburn who alwai clung
to him he had hi flirtat also be a man of suscept who
wa popular with women how could thei be avoid for abov all thing
godfrei wa a man not a hermit or a saint or an sthete but just a
man with more gift of a sort than have some other he live the life
of the rest he hunt he shot tiger do those thing that the
angloindian offic doe but all the same he studi whether it were
of hi trade of soldier or of the nativ or of eastern thought
and law he wa alwai learn someth till at last he knew a great
deal often he wonder to what end
and yet with all hi friend and acquaint in a wai he remain a
veri lone man as those who ar a littl out of the ordinari often
do in the common groov we rub against the other marbl run down
it but onc we leap over it edg then where ar we we cannot wander
off into space becaus of the attract of the earth that is so near
to us and yet we ar alon in the air until with a bump we meet our
nativ ground therefor for the most of us the groov is much better
and yet some who leav it have been carri elsewher if onli for a
littl while like st paul into the third heaven
chapter xviii
franceand after
noth so veri remark happen to godfrei dure those ten year
of hi life in india or at least onli on or two thing thu onc he
got into a scrape for which he wa not realli respons and got out
of it again as he imagin without remark until isobel show her
common and rather pain intimaci with it detail of which she
appear to take a somewhat uncharit view at ani rate so far as
the ladi wa concern
the other matter wa more seriou sinc it involv the loss of hi
greatest friend arthur thorburn briefli what happen wa thi
there wa a frontier disturb godfrei who by now wa a staff
offic had been sent to a far outpost held by thorburn with a certain
number of men and there took command a reconnaiss wa necessari
and thorburn went out for that purpos with over half of the avail
garrison of the post have receiv written order that he wa not to
engag the enemi unless he found himself absolut surround in the
end thorburn did engag the enemi with the result that practic he
and hi forc were extermin but not befor thei had inflict such
a lesson on the said enemi that it su for peac and ha been great
friend with the british power ever sinc
first howev a feebl attack wa made on godfrei camp that he beat
off without the loss of a singl man exagger account of which
were telegraph home repres it as a rork drift defenc
godfrei wa heartbroken he had love thi man as a brother more
inde than brother often love and now thorburn hi onli friend wa
dead the dark had taken him that impenetr devour dark
out of which we come and into which we go religion told him he should
not griev that thorburn doubtless wa much better off whither he had
gone than he could ever have been on earth although it wa true the
same religion said that he might be much wors off sinc thither hi
fail would have follow him dismiss the latter possibl
how could he be happi in a new world godfrei wonder have left all
he care for behind him and without possibl of commun with
them
in short all the old problem of which he had not thought much sinc
miss ogilvi di came back to godfrei with ad forc and left him
wretch nor wa he consol by the sequel of the affair of which he
wa bound to report the fact the gallant man who wa dead wa blame
unjustli for what had happen as perhap he deserv who had not
succeed sinc those who set their blind ey to the telescop as
nelson did must justifi their action by success
godfrei on the other hand who had done littl but defeat an attack
made by exhaust and dispirit men wa prais to the ski and
found himself figur as a kind of hero in the english press which
after a long period of peac have lost all sens of proport in
such matter wa glad of anyth that could be made to serv the
purpos of sensat ultim he wa thank by the govern of
india made a brevetmajor and decor with the dso of all of
which it mai be said with truth that never were such honour receiv
with less pleasur
so much did he griev over thi unhappi busi that hi health wa
affect and be run down in the end he took some sort of fever and
wa veri ill inde when at length he recov more or less he went
befor a medic board who order him promptli to england on six
month leav
most men would have rejoic but godfrei did not he had littl wish
to return to england where except mr parson there were none he
desir to see save on whom he wa sworn not to see thi he could
bear while thei were thousand of mile apart but to be in the same
countri with isobel in the same town perhap and forbidden to hear
her voic or to touch her hand how could he bear that still he had no
choic in thi matter arrang by the hand of fate and went
reflect that he would go to lucern and spent the time with the
pasteur perhap even he would live in the beauti hous that miss
ogilvi had left to him or a corner of it see that it wa empti
for the tenant to whom it had been let had gone awai
so he start at the end of the first week in juli 1914
when hi ship reach marseil it wa to find that the world wa
buzz with strang rumour there wa talk of war in europ russia
wa said to be mobilis germani wa said to be mobilis franc
wa said to be mobilis it wa even rumour that england might be
drawn into some titan struggl of the nation and yet no accur
inform wa obtain the english paper thei saw were somewhat
old and their report vagu in the extrem
much excit like everyon els godfrei telegraph to the india
offic ask leav to come home direct overland which he could not
do without permiss sinc he wa in command of a number of soldier
who were return to england on furlough
no answer came to hi wire befor hi ship sail and therefor he wa
oblig to proce by long sea still it had import consequ
which at the moment he could not forese in the bai the tide that
reach them by marconigram were evid so carefulli censor that
out of them thei could make noth except that the empir wa fill
with great doubt and anxieti and that the world stood on the verg of
such a war as had never been known in histori
at length thei came to southampton where the pilotboat brought him a
telegram order him to report himself without delai three hour
later he wa in london at the india offic where he wa kept wait
a while he wa shown into the room of a promin and harass
offici who had some paper in front of him
you ar major knight said the offici well here is your record
befor me and it is good veri good inde but i see that you ar on
sick leav ar you too ill for servic
no answer godfrei the voyag ha set me up i feel as well as
ever i did
that fortun answer the offici but there is a doctor on
the premis and to make sure he shall have a look at you go down and
see him if you will and then come back here with hi report and he
rang a bell and gave some order
within half an hour godfrei wa back in the room with a clean bill of
health the offici read the certif and remark that he wa
go to send him over to the war offic where he would make an
appoint for him by telephon
what for sir ask godfrei you see i am onli just off my ship and
veri ignor of the new
the new is major knight that we shall be at war with germani befor
we ar twelv hour older wa the solemn answer offic ar
want and we ar give everi good man from india on whom we can lai
our hand thei wont put you on the staff becaus you have everyth
to learn about european work but i expect thei will find you a billet
in on of the expeditionari regiment and now goodby and good luck
to you for i have lot of men to see by the wai i take it for
grant that you volunt for the job
of cours repli godfrei simpli and went awai to wander about the
endless passag of the war offic till at length he discov the man
whom he must see
a few tumultu dai went by and he found himself upon a steamer
cross to franc attach to a famou english regiment
the next month alwai remain in godfrei mind as a kind of nightmar
in which he move on plain stain the colour of blood beneath a sky
black with bellow thunder and illumin occasion by a blaze of
splendour it would be useless to attempt to set out the experi and
adventur of the particular cavalri regiment to which he wa attach
as a major sinc notwithstand their infinit varieti thei were
such as all share whose glori it wa to take part with what the kaiser
call the contempt littl armi of england in the ineff
retreat from mon that retreat which save franc and civilis
godfrei plai hi part well onc or twice with heroism inde but
what of that amid eighti thousand hero back he stagger with the
rest exhaust sleepless fight fight fight hi mind
fill altern with horror and with wonder horror at the deed to
which men can sink and the gener scheme of thing that make them
possibl wonder at the height to which thei can rise when lift by
the inspir of a great ideal and a holi caus death he reflect
could not after all mean so veri much to man see how brave it wa
met everi minut of the dai and night and that the aspect of it often
so terribl did but encourag other in like fashion to smile and die
but oh what did it all mean and who rule thi univers with such a
flame bloodstain sword
then at last came the turn of the tide when the hungri german wolf wa
oblig to abandon that pari which alreadi he thought between hi jaw
and a few dai after it the charg the on splendid perfect charg
that consol godfrei and those with him for all which thei had
suffer lost and fear he wa in command of the regiment now for
those superior to him had been kill and he direct and accompani
that charg thei thunder on to the mass of the german who were
retreat with no time to entrench or set entangl a gentl
slope in front and hard clear ground beneath their hors feet thei
cut through them thei trod them down thei drove them by score and
hundr into the stream beyond till those two battalion or what
remain of them were but a tangl drown mob it wa finish
the english squadron turn to retreat as had been order
then of a sudden godfrei felt a dull blow for a few moment
conscious remain to him he call out some command about the
retir it came to hi mind that thu it wa well to die in the
moment of hi littl victori after thatblack
when hi sens return to him he found himself ly in the curtain
corner of a big room at least he thought it wa big becaus of the
vast expans of ceil which he could see abov the curtain rod and
the sound without some of which seem to come from a distanc there
wa a window too through which he caught sight of lawn and statu
and formal tree just then the curtain wa drawn and there appear a
middleag woman dress in white look veri calm veri kind and
veri spotless who start a littl when she saw that hi ey were
open and that hi face wa intellig
where am i he ask and wa puzzl to observ that the sound of
hi voic seem feebl and far awai
in the hospit at versail she answer in a pleasant voic
inde he murmur it occur to me that it might be heaven or
some place of the sort
if you look through the curtain you wouldnt call it heaven she
said with a sigh ad no major you were near to go west
veri near but you never got to the gate of heaven
i cant rememb he murmur again
of cours you cant so dont try for you see you got it in the head
a bit of shell and a nice oper or rather oper thei had
over you if it wasnt for that clever surgeonbut there never mind
shall i recov
of cours you will we have had no doubt about that for the last week
you have been here nearli three you know onli you see we thought
you might be blind someth to do with the nerv of the ey but it
appear that isnt so now be quiet for i cant stop talk to you
with two dy just outsid and anoth whom i hope to save
on thing nurseabout the war have the german got pari
that a silli question major which make me think you aint so
right as i believ if those brute had pari do you think you would
be at versail or at ani rate that i should dont you bother
about the war it all right or as right as it is like to be for
mani a long dai
then she went
a week later godfrei wa allow to get out of bed and wa even carri
to sit in the autumn sunshin among other shatter men now he learn
all there wa to know that the german rush had been stai that thei
had been head off from calai and that the armi were entrench
opposit to each other and prepar for the winter the alli caus
have been save as it were by a miracl at ani rate for the while
he wa still veri weak with great pain in hi head and could not read
at all which griev him
so the time went by till at last he wa told that he wa to be sent to
england as hi bed wa want and he could recov there as well as in
franc two dai later he start in a hospit train and suffer much
upon the journei although it wa broken for a night at boulogn still
he came safe to london and wa taken to a central hospit where
next dai sever doctor held a consult over him when it wa over
thei ask him if he had friend in london and wish to stai there he
repli that he had no friend except an old nurs at hampstead if she
were still there and that he did not like london then there wa talk
among them and the word torquai wa mention the head doctor seem
to agre but as he wa leav chang hi mind
too long a journei he said it would knock him up give me that
list here thi place will do quit close and got up regardless i am
told for she veri rich that what he wantscomfort and
firstclass food and with a nod to godfrei who wa listen in an
idl fashion quit indiffer as to hi destin he wa gone
next dai thei carri him off in an ambul through the crowd
strand and present he found himself at liverpool street where he
wa put into an invalid carriag he ask the orderli where he wa
go but the man did not seem to know or had forgotten the name so
troubl no more about it he took a dose of medicin as he had been
order and present went to sleep as no doubt it wa intend that
he should do when he woke up again it wa to find himself be lift
from anoth ambul into a hous which wa veri dark perhap
becaus of the light order for now night had fallen he wa
carri in a chair up some stair into a veri nice bedroom and there
put to bed by two men thei went awai leav him alon
someth puzzl him about the place at first he could not think what
it wa then he knew the smell of it wa familiar to him he did not
recognis the room but the smell he did seem to recognis though
be weak and shaken he could not connect it with ani particular hous
or local now there were voic in the passag and he knew that he
must be dream for the onli on that he could realli hear sound
exactli like to that of old mr parson he smile at the thought and
shut hi ey the voic that wa like to that of mr parson di
awai sai as it went
no i havent got the name but i dare sai thei ar downstair ill
go and look
the door open and he heard someon enter a woman thi time by her
tread he did not see both becaus hi ey were still almost close
and for the reason that the electr light wa heavili shade so he
just lai there wonder quit vagu where he wa and who the woman
might be she came near to the bed and look down at him for he heard
her dress rustl as she bent then he becam awar of a veri strang
sensat he felt as though someth were flow from that woman to
him some strang and concentr power of thought which wa chang
into a kind of agoni of joi the woman abov him began to breath
quickli in sigh as it were and he knew that she wa stir he knew

i cant tell you except becaus i know that it is so we come to
strang conclus out yonder where onli death seem to be true and
all the rest a dream what we call the real and the unreal get mix
a kind of wave of happi pass through her so obviou that it wa
visibl to the watch godfrei

he broke in
you foolish godfrei she murmur and move a littl awai from him
just then the door open and mr parson look veri odd in a
nurs dress with the cap awri upon her grei hair enter carri a
bit of paper
the hunt i had she began that silli newfangl kind of a
girlclerk have stuck the paper awai under the letter ofor
offic you know missin some fanci box of her and then gone off
to tea here ar the name but i cant see without my spec
at thi point someth in the attitud of the two struck her
someth that her instinct told her wa uncommon and she stood
irresolut isobel step to her as though to take the list and
bend down whisper into her ear
what said mr parson sure i didnt understand you know im
get deaf as well as blind sai the name again
isobel obei still in a whisper
him exclaim the old woman him our godfrei and youv been
and let on who you werey who call yourself a nurs command
why i dare sai youll be the death of him out you go miss anywai
ill take charg of thi case for the present and as it seem to
godfrei watch from the far corner liter she bundl isobel
from the room
then she shut and lock the door come to the bedsid she knelt down
rather stiffli look at him for a while to make sure and kiss him
not onc but mani time
so you have come back my dear she said and onli half dead well
we wont have no young woman push between you and me just at
present command or not time enough for lovemak when you ar
stronger oh and i never thought to see you again there must be a
good god somewher after all although he did make them german
then again she fell to kiss and bless him her hot tear drop
on hi face and upset him ten time as much as isobel had done
sinc in thi topsyturvi world often thing work by contrari oddli
enough no harm came to godfrei from these fierc excit inde he
slept better than he had done sinc he found hi mind again and awok
still weak of cours but without ani temperatur or pain in hi head
now it wa that there began the most bliss period of all hi life
isobel when she had recov her balanc made him understand that he
wa a patient and that excit talk or act must be avoid he on
hi part fell in with her wish and inde wa well content to do so
for a while he want noth more than just to lie there and watch her
move in and out of hi room with hi food or flower or whatev it
might be for a burst of bad weather prevent him from go out of
door then as he strengthen she began to talk to him which mr
parson did long befor that event tell him all that for year he
had long to know no not all but some thing among other matter
she describ to him the detail of her father end which occur in
a veri characterist fashion
you see dear she said as he grew older hi passion for
moneymak increas more and more why i am sure i cannot sai
see that heaven know he had enough
ye said godfrei i suppos you ar a veri rich woman
she nod sai so rich that i dont know how rich for realli i
havent troubl even to read all the figur and as yet thei ar not
complet moreov i believ that soon i shall be much richer ill
tell you why present the odd thing is too that my father di
intest so i get everi farth i believ he meant to make a will
with some rather peculiar provis that perhap you can guess but
thi will wa never made
why not ask godfrei
becaus he di first that all it wa thi wai he or rather hi
firm which is onli anoth name for him for he own threefourth of
the capit got some tremend ship contract with the govern
aris out of the war that secur an enorm profit to them how
much i cant tell you but hundr and hundr of thousand of
pound he had been veri anxiou about thi contract for hi term
were so stiff that the offici who manag such affair hesit
about sign them at last on dai after a long and i gather stormi
interview with i dont know whom in the cours of which some rather
strong languag seem to have been us the contract wa sign and
deliv to the firm my father came home to thi hous with a copi of
it in hi pocket he wa veri triumphant for he look at the matter
sole from a busi point of view not at all from that of the
countri also he wa veri tire for he had ag much dure the last
few year and suffer occasion from heart attack to keep
himself up he drank a great deal of wine at dinner first champagn and
then the best part of a bottl of port thi made him talk and he
kept me sit there to listen to him while he boast poor man of
how he had walk round the offici who thought themselv so
clever but never saw some trap which he had set for them
and what did you do ask godfrei
you know veri well what i did i grew angri i could not help it and
told him i thought it wa shame to make monei wrongfulli out of the
countri at such a time especi when he did not want it at all then
he wa furiou and answer that he did want it to support the peerag
which he wa go to get he said also she ad slowli that i wa
an ignor interf vixen ye that is what he call me a
vixen who had alwai been a disappoint to him and thwart hi
plan howev he went on as you think so littl of my hardearn
monei ill take care that you dont have more of it than i can help i
am not go to leav it to be wast on silli chariti by a sour old
maid for that what you ar sinc you cant get hold of your
preciou parson son who i hope will be sent to the war and kill
ill see the lawyer tomorrow and make a will which i hope youll
find pleasant read on dai
i answer that he might make what will he like and left the room
though he tri to stop me
about half an hour later i saw the butler run about the garden
where i wa look for me in the gloom and heard him call come
to sir john miss come to sir john
i went in and there wa my father fallen forward on the diningroom
tabl with blood come from hi lip though i believ thi wa
caus by a crush wineglass hi pocketbook wa open beneath him in
which he had been write figur of hi estat and i think head
for the will he meant to make but these i could not read sinc the
faint pencil wa blot out with blood he wa quit dead from
some kind of a stroke follow by heart failur as the doctor said
is that all the pleasant stori ask godfrei
ye except that there be no will i inherit everyth or shall
do so i tri to get that contract cancel but could not first
becaus have onc made it the govern would not consent sinc to
do so would have been a reflect on those concern and secondli
for the reason that the other partner in the ship busi
object so we shall have to give it back in some other wai
godfrei look at her and said
you meant to sai that you will have to give it back
i dont know what i meant she answer colour but have said
we i think i will be like the govern and stick to it that is
unless you object veri much my dear
object i object and take the hand that wa nearest to him he
cover it with kiss as he did so he note that for the first time
she wore the littl ring with turquois heart upon her third finger
the ring that so mani year befor he had bought at lucern the ring
that through mr parson he had sent her in the pillbox on the
even of their separ
thi wa the onli form of engag that ever pass between them the
truth be that from the moment he enter the place it wa all taken
for grant not onli by themselv but by everyon in the hous
includ the wound with thi develop of an intellig
instinct it is possibl that mr parson had someth to do
chapter xix
marriag
in that atmospher of perfect bliss godfrei cure wa quick for bliss
it wa save onli that there wa anoth bliss beyond to be attain
rememb that thi man now approach middl life had never drunk of
the cup of what is known as love upon the earth
some might answer that such is the univers experi that true
complet love ha no exist except it be that love of god to which
a few at last attain sinc in what we know as god complet and
absolut uniti can be found alon other love all have their flaw
with on except perhap that of the love of the dead which fondli
we imagin to be unchang for the rest passion howev exalt
pass or at least becom dull with year the most cherish children
grow up and in so do by the law of natur grow awai friend ar
estrang and lost in their own live
upon the earth there is no perfect love it must be sought elsewher
sinc have the chang shadow we know there is a sky wherein
shine the sun that cast them
godfrei as it chanc omit isobel had walk littl even in
these sweet shadow there were but three other for whom he had felt
devot in all hi dai mr parson hi tutor monsieur boiset and
hi friend arthur thorburn who wa gone therefor to him isobel wa
everyth as a child he had ador her as a woman she wa hi
desir hi faith and hi worship
if thi were so with him still more wa it the case with isobel who
in truth care for no other human be someth in her natur
prevent her from contract violent femal friendship and to all
men except a few of abil each of them old enough to be her father
she wa total indiffer inde most of them repel her on
godfrei and godfrei alon from the first moment she saw him as a
child she had pour all the deep treasur of her heart he wa at onc
her divin and her other self the segment that complet her life
circl without which it wa noth but a useless broken ring
so much did thi seem to her to be so that notwithstand her lack of
faith in matter beyond proof and knowledg she never conceiv of
thi passion of her as have had a begin or of be capabl of
an end thi contradictori woman would argu against the possibl of
ani futur exist yet she wa quit certain that her love for
godfrei had a futur exist and inde on that wa endless when
at length he put it to her that her attitud wa most illog sinc
that which wa dead and dissolv could not exist in ani place or
shape she thought for a while and repli quietli
then i must be wrong
wrong in what ask godfrei
in suppos that we do not live after death the continu of our
love i know to be beyond ani doubt and if it involv our
continu as individu entitieswel then we continu that is
all
we might continu as a singl entiti he suggest
perhap she answer and if so thi would be better still for it
must be imposs to lose on anoth while that remain aliv
compris both
thu and in these few word although she never becam altogeth
orthodox or took quit the same view of such mysteri as did godfrei
isobel made her great recant for which probabl there would never
have been ani need had she been born in differ surround and
found some other spiritu guid in youth than mr knight as the
cruelti and the narrow bitter of the world had bred unfaith in
her so did suprem love breed faith if of an unusu sort sinc she
learn that without the faith her love must die and the love she knew
to be immort therefor the exist of that live love presuppos
all the rest and convinc her which in on of her obstin natur
noth els could possibl have done no not if she had seen a
miracl also thi love of her wa so profound and beauti that she
felt it true origin and ultim home must be elsewher than on the
earth
that wa why she consent to be marri in church somewhat to
godfrei surpris
in due cours have practic recov hi health godfrei
appear befor a board in london which pass him as fit for servic
but gave him a month leav with thi document he return to hawk
hall and there show it to isobel
and when the month is up she ask look at him
then i suppos i shall have to join my regiment unless thei send me
somewher els
a month is a veri short time she went on still look at him and
turn a littl pale
ye dear but lot can happen in it as we found out in franc for
instanc he ad with a littl hesit we can get marri
that is if you wish
you know veri well godfrei that i have wish it for quit ten
year
and you know veri well isobel that i have wish itwel ever
sinc i understood what marriag wa how about tomorrow he
exclaim after a paus
she laugh and shook her head
i believ godfrei that some sort of licens is necessari and it is
past post time also it would look scarc decent all these peopl
would laugh at us also as there is a good deal of properti concern
i must make some arrang
what arrang he ask
she laugh again that is my affair you know i am a great support
of woman right
oh i see he repli vagu to keep it all free from the
husband control c
ye godfrei that it what a busi head you have you should
join the ship firm after the war
then thei settl to be marri on that dai week after which isobel
suggest that he should take up hi abod at the abbei hous where
the clergyman a bachelor would be veri glad to have him as a guest
when godfrei inquir why she repli blandli becaus hi room wa
want for anoth patient he be now cure and that therefor he
had no right to stop there
oh i see how selfish of me said godfrei and went off to arrang
matter with the clergyman a friendli and accommod young man
with the result that on thi night onc more he slept in the room he
had occupi as a boi for her part isobel telephon first to her
dressmak and secondli to the lawyer who wa wind up her father
estat request these import person to come to see her on the
morrow
thei came quickli sinc isobel wa too valuabl a client to be
neglect arriv by the same train with the result that the lawyer
wa kept wait an hour and a half by the dressmak a fact which he
rememb in hi bill when at last hi turn came isobel did not
detain him long
i am go to be marri she said on the twentyfourth to major
godfrei knight of the indian cavalri will you kindli prepar two
document the first to be sign befor my marriag and the second a
will immedi after it sinc otherwis it would be invalid by
that chang in my condit
the lawyer stare at her sinc so much legal knowledg wa not common
among hi ladi client and ask for instruct as to what the
document were to set out
thei will be veri simpl said isobel the first a marriag
settlement will settl half my incom free of my control upon my
futur husband dure our joint live the second that is the will
will leav to him all my properti real and person
i must point out to you miss blake said the astonish lawyer
that these provis ar veri unusu doe major knight bring larg
sum into settlement
i dont think so she answer hi mean ar quit moder and if
thei were not it would never occur to him to do anyth of the sort
as he understand noth about monei also circumstanc as i am it
doe not matter in the least
your late father would have taken a differ view snif the
lawyer
possibl repli isobel for our view vari upon most point
while he wa aliv i gave wai to hi to my great loss and sorrow now
that he is dead i follow my own
well that is definit miss blake and of cours your wish must be
obei but as regard thi will do not think me indel for
mention it but there might be children
i dont think you at all indel why should i at over thirti year
of ag i have consid the point if we ar bless with ani
children and i should predeceas him my futur husband will make such
arrang for their welfar as he consid wise and just i have
everi confid in hi judgment and if he should happen to die
intest which i think veri probabl thei would inherit equal
there is enough for ani number of them
unless he lose or spend it groan the lawyer
he is much more like to save it from some mistaken sens of duti
and to live entir on what he ha of hi own remark isobel if
so it cannot be help and no doubt the poor will benefit now if you
thoroughli understand what i wish done i think that is all i have to
see the dressmak again so goodby
executor gasp the lawyer
public truste said isobel over her shoulder
thei sai that she is on of these suffragett women although she
keep it dark well i can believ it anywai thi offic is tumbl
into honei and there no fool like a woman in love said the lawyer
to himself as he pack hi bag of paper
isobel wa quit right the question of settlement never even occur
to godfrei he wa awar howev that it is usual for a bridegroom to
make the bride a present and go to london walk miser up and
down bond street look into window until he wa tire at on moment
he fix hi affect upon an old queen ann porring which hi
natur tast told him to be quit beauti but have learn from
the dealer that it wa meant for the mix of infant pap he retir
abash almost next door he saw in a jewel window a necklac of
small pearl price at three hundr pound and probabl worth about
half that amount have quit a handsom balanc at hi back he came
to the conclus that he could afford thi and go in bought it at
onc oblivi of the fact that isobel alreadi had rope of pearl the
size of marrowfat pea howev she wa delight with it especi
when she saw what it had cost him for he had never thought to cut the
sale ticket from the necklac it wa those pearl and not the
marrowfat pea that isobel wore upon her wed dai save for the
littl ring with the two turquois heart these were her onli ornament
a question aros as to where the honeymoon or so much as would remain
of on wa to be spent godfrei would have like to go to lucern and
visit the pasteur but as thi could not be manag in war time
suggest london
why london exclaim isobel
onli becaus most ladi like theatr though i confess i hate them
myself
you silli man she answer do you suppos when we can have onli a
few dai togeth that i want to wast time in theatr
in the end it wa settl that thei would go to london for a night and
then on to cornwal which thei hope fondli might be warm at that time
of year
so at last on the twentyfourth dai of decemb of that fate year
1914 thei were marri in the abbei church isobel uncl the on
with whom she had stai in mexico and who had retir now from the
diplomat servic gave her awai and a young cousin of her wa the
sole bridesmaid for the ceremoni wa of the sort call a war
wed her dress howev wa splendid of it kind some rich thing
of flow broider silk with a veil of wondrou lace
either from accid or by design in gener effect it much resembl
that of the plantagenet ladi which onc she had copi from the brass
perhap be dissatisfi with her former effort she determin to
recap it on a more splendid scale or perhap it wa a chanc at ani
rate the veil rais in two point from her head fell down like that
of the nameless ladi while from her elbow long narrow sleev hung
almost to the ground beauti isobel never wa but in thi garb
with happi shine in her ey her tall wellmad form look
impos and even state an effect that wa heighten by her
deliber and dignifi movement the great church wa crowd for
the new of thi wed had spread far and wide and it romant
charact attract peopl both from the neighbour villag and the
littl town
set in the splendid surround of the old abbei through the paint
window of which gleam the winter sun godfrei in hi glitter
indian uniform and order and hi bride in her quaint rich dress
made a strike pair at the altar rail inde it is doubt whether
sinc hundr of year ago the old crusad and hi fair ladi whose
ash were beneath their feet stood where thei stood for thi same
purpos of marriag clad in coat of mail and gleam silk a
noblerlook coupl had been wed in that ancient fane
oddli enough with the strang inconsequ of the human mind
especi in moment of suppress excit it wa of thi nameless
ladi and her lord that godfrei kept think throughout the servic
onc more wonder who thei were and what wa their stori he
rememb too how the grave of that unknown pair had been connect
with hi fortun and those of isobel here it wa that thei plight
the troth which now thei were about to fulfil here it wa that he had
bidden her farewel befor he went to switzerland he could see her now
as she wa then tall and slender in her white robe and the red rai of
sunshin gleam like a splash of blood upon her breast he glanc at
her by hi side as she turn toward him and behold there it shone
again splendid yet omin
he shiver a littl at the sight of ith knew not whyand wa glad
when a dens black snowcloud hid the face of the sun and kill it
it wa over at last and thei were man and wife
do these word and vow and ceremoni make ani differ to you
she whisper as thei walk side by side down the church the observ
of all observ thei do not to me i feel as though all the rite in
the world would be quit powerless and without mean in face of the
fact of our etern uniti
it wa a queer littl speech for her to make with it thought and
balanc godfrei often reflect afterward express as it did a
great truth so far as thei were concern sinc no ceremoni howev
hallow could increas their exist on or take awai therefrom
at the moment howev he scarc understood it and onli smile in
repli
then thei went into the vestri and sign their name and everyth
wa over here godfrei former truste gener cubitt grown veri
old now but as bustl and emphat as of yore who sign the book
as on of the wit buttonhol him at some length he explain
how he had been to see an emin swell at the war offic a dugout
who wa an old friend of hi and impress upon him hi godfrei
extraordinari abil as a soldier point out that he ought at
onc to be given command of a regiment and how the emin swell had
promis that he would see to it forthwith oh if he had onli known
he would not have thank him
at last thei start for the motorcar which wa to drive them in pomp
three hundr yard to the hall some delai occur anoth motorcar
at the church gate would not start and had to be drawn out of the wai
three or four of the nurs from the hospit and certain local ladi
surround isobel and burst into talk and congratul thu
separ her from godfrei
overhear complimentari remark about himself he drew back a littl
from the porch into the church which had now empti as he stood there
someon tap him on the shoulder the touch disturb him it wa
unpleas to him and he turn impati to see from whom it came
there in front of him bundl up in a rusti black cloak of which the
hood cover the head wa a short fat woman her face wa hidden but
from the cavern recess of the hood two pierc black ey shone

chapter xx
order
godfrei and hi wife never went to cornwal after all for on christma
dai the weather turn so bad and travel wa so difficult that thei
determin to stop where thei were for a few dai
as for them the roof of thi london hotel had becom synonym with
that of the crystal dome of heaven thi did not matter in the least
there thei sat in their hideou overgild privat sittingroom or
when the weather wa clear enough went for walk in the park and onc
to the south kensington museum where thei enjoi themselv veri

inwardli oh how she rejoic though all she said wa that it would
give him time to complet hi shop
save for the advanc shadow of separ and a constant stream of

the ship cast off and isobel stood in the even light watch from
the quai till godfrei vanish and the vessel which bore him wa
swallow up in the shadow then she went back to the hotel and
throw herself upon that widow bed kiss the place where hi head
had lain and wept ah how she wept for her joydai were done and
her heart wa break in her
after thi isobel took a night train back to town and return to
hawk hall threw herself with the energi that wa remark in her
into the manag of her hospit and mani anoth work and chariti
connect with the war for it wa onli in work that she could forget

godfrei had a comfort and a prosper voyag sinc it wa almost
befor the dai of submarin at ani rate so far as passeng steamer
were concern and thei saw no enemi ship therefor within littl
more than a month he land on the hot shore of mombasa and could
cabl to isobel that he wa safe and well and receiv her love answer
hi next busi wa to report himself in the proper quarter which he
did those over him seem quit bewild as to what he had come for
or what he wa to do and could onli suggest that he should travel to
nairobi and uganda and put himself in touch with the civil author
thi he did also and as a result formul a certain scheme of
action to which hi militari superior assent intim that he
might do as he like so long as he did not interfer with them
what happen to him mai be veri briefli describ in the end he
start to visit a great chief on the border of german east africa
but in british territori a man whose loyalti wa rumour to be
doubt thi chief jaga by name wa a profess christian and at
hi town there live a missionari of the name of tafelett who had
built a church there and wa said to have much influenc over him so
with the reverend mr tafelett godfrei commun by runner sai
that he wa come to visit him accordingli he start with a guard of
nativ troop a colour interpret and some servant but without
ani white companion sinc the attack on german territori wa begin
and no on could be spare to go with him upon a diplomat mission
the journei wa long and arduou involv mani dai of march
across the east african veld and through it forest where game of all
sort wa extraordinarili plenti and at night thei were surround
by lion at length howev with the except of on man who
remain with the lion thei arriv safe at the town of jaga and
were met by mr tafelett who took godfrei into hi hous a neat
thatch build with a wide verandah that stood by the church which
wa a kind of whitewash shed also thatch
mr tafelett prove to be a clergyman of good birth and stand on
of those earnest saintlik soul who follow liter the scriptur
injunct and abandon all to advanc the caus of their master in the
dark place of the earth a tall thin nervouslook man of not much
over thirti year of ag on too possess of consider privat
mean he had some five year befor given up a good live in england
in order to obei what he consid to be hi call be sent to
thi outli post he found it in a condit of the most complet
savageri and work as few have done he built the church with nativ
labour furnish it beautifulli insid mostli at hi own expens he
learn the local languag he start a school he combat the
witchdoctor and medicinemen
final he met with hi reward in the convers of the young chief
jaga which wa follow by that of a consider portion of hi
peopl
but here came the troubl the bulk of the tribe which wa larg and
power did not share their chief view for instanc hi uncl
alulu the head rainmak and witchdoctor differ from them veri
emphat he wa shrewd enough to see that the triumph of
christian meant hi destruct also the abandon of all their
ancient custom he harangu the tribe in secret ask them if thei
wish to bring upon themselv the vengeanc of their ancestr and
other spirit and to go through their dai as the possessor of onli
on miser wife question to which thei answer that emphat
thei did not so the tribe wa rent in two and by far the smaller half
clung to jaga to whom the dim turbul heathen thousand beneath hi
rule render but a lip servic
then came the war and alulu and hi great follow saw their
opportun why should thei not be rid of jaga and the christian
teacher with hi newfangl notion if it could be done in no other
wai why should thei not move across the border which wa close by
into german territori the german at ani rate would not bother them
about such matter under their rule thei might live as their
forefath had done from the begin and have as mani wive as thei
chose without be call all sort of ugli name
thi wa the posit when godfrei arriv hi come made a great
sensat he wa report to be a veri big lord inde as big or
bigger than the king governor himself alulu put it about that he had
come to make a soldier of everi fit man and to enslav the women and
the elder to work on the road or in drag gun the place seeth
with secret ferment
mr tafelett knew someth of all thi through jaga who wa genuin
frighten and commun it to godfrei in the result a meet of
all the headmen wa held which wa attend by thousand of the
peopl godfrei spoke through hi interpret sai that in thi
great war the king of england requir their help and gener set
out the object of hi mission remark that were receiv in
respect silenc then alulu spoke devot himself chiefli to an
attack upon the christian faith and on the interfer of the white
teacher with their custom that he observ had result in their
ancestr spirit curs them with the worst drought thei had
experienc for year which in the circumst he alulu could and
would do noth to allevi how could thei fight and work for the
great king when their stomach were pinch with hunger ow to the
witchcraft and magic rite which the white teacher celebr in the
church
how inde shout the heathen section although in fact their
season had been veri good while the christian feel themselv in
a minor were silent
then the chief jaga spoke he travers all the argument of alulu
whom he denounc in no measur term sai that he wa plot
against him final he came down heavili on the side of the british
remark that he knew who were the wouldb traitor and that thei
should suffer in due cours
it ha been whisper in my ear he conclud that there is a plot
afoot against my friend the white teacher who ha done us all so much
good it ha even been whisper that there ar those here he look
hard at alulu who have declar that it would be well to kill thi
great white lord who is our guest and he point to godfrei with hi
littl chief staff so that he mai not return to tell who ar the
true traitor among the peopl of jaga i sai to you who have thought
such thing that thi lord is the greatest of all lord and as well
might you lai hand on our father the mighti king of england himself
as upon thi hi friend and counsellor if a drop of hi blood is shed
then sure the king armi will come and we shall die everi on of
us the innoc and the guilti togeth for terribl will be the
vengeanc of the king
thi outburst made a great impress for all the multitud cri
it is so we know that it is so and alulu interpos that he would
as soon think of murder hi own mother who mr tafelett whisper
to godfrei had been dead these mani year as of touch a hair of
the great white chief head on the contrari it wa their desir to
do everyth that he order them but concern the matter of the
new custom of have on wife onli etc
thi brought mr tafelett to hi feet for on monogami he wa
especi strong and the meet end on a theolog discuss
which nearli result in blow between the faction final it wa
adjourn for a week when it wa arrang that an answer should be
given to godfrei demand
three night later an answer wa given and on of a terribl sort
shortli after sundown godfrei wa sit in the missionari hous
write a report mr tafelett it be sundai wa hold an even
servic in the church at which jaga and most of the christian were
present suddenli a tumult aros and the air wa rent with savag
shout and shriek godfrei sprang up and snatch hi revolv just as
some of hi servant arriv and announc that the peopl in the
church were be kill act on hi first impuls he ran to the
place call to hi guard to follow him which thei did so tardili
that he enter it alon here a sight of horror met hi ey
the build wa full of dead and dy peopl by the altar dress
in hi savag witchdoctor gear stood alulu a lamp in hi hand
with which evid he had been fire the church for tongu of
flame ran up the wall on the altar itself wa someth that had a
white cloth thrown over it as do the sacr vessel catch sight of
godfrei with a yell the brute tore awai the napkin reveal the
sever head of mr tafelett whose surplicedrap bodi godfrei now
distinguish ly in the shadow on on side of the altar
here is the white medicineman magic wine he scream point to
the blood that ran down the broider frontal come drink come
drink
godfrei ran forward up the church hi pistol in hi hand when he
reach the chancel he stop and fire at the mouth bedizen
devil who wa danc hideous in front of the altar the heavi
servicerevolv bullet struck him in some mortal place for he leapt
into the air grab at the altar cloth and fell to the ground there
he lai still cover by the cloth with the massiv brass crucifix
rest face downward on hi breast and the murder man head ly
at hi sidea though it were look at him
thi wa the last sight that godfrei saw for mani a dai for just then
a spear pierc hi breast also someth struck him on the templ a
curiou recollect rose in hi mind of the head of a mummi after the
pasteur had broken it off roll along the floor in the flat at
lucern then he thought he heard madam rienn laugh after which
he rememb no more it might have been a thousand year or it might
have been a minut for he had pass into a state that take no reck
of time
godfrei began to dream he dream that he wa travel that he wa
in a hous and then a long while afterward that he wa make a
journei by sea
anoth vacuum of nothing and he dream again thi time veri
vividli now hi dream wa that he had come to egypt and wa stretch
on a bed in a room through the window of which he could see the
pyramid quit close at hand more he seem to becom acquaint with
all their histori he saw them in the build multitud of brown men
drag huge block of stone up a slope of sand he saw them finish
on by on and all the ceremoni of the worship with which thei were
connect dead pharaoh were laid to rest there beneath hi ey
live pharaoh prai within their chapel and made oblat to the
spirit of those who had gone befor them while ever the whiterob
shaven priest chant in hi ear
then all pass and he saw them mighti as ever but desert stand
there in the desert the monument of a forgotten great till at
length a new peopl came and strip off their marbl cover
these thing he rememb afterward but there were mani more that he
forgot
again godfrei dream a strang and beauti dream which went on from
dai to dai it wa that he wa veri ill and that isobel had come to
nurs him she came quit suddenli and at first seem a littl
frighten and disturb but afterward veri happi inde thi went
on for a while till suddenli there struck him a sens of someth
terribl that had happen of an upheav of condit of a
wrench asund of ti of chang utter and profound
then while he mourn becaus she wa not there isobel came again but
differ the differ wa indefin but it wa undoubt her
appear seem to have chang somewhat and in the interv
between her come he could never rememb how she had been cloth
except for two thing which she alwai seem to wear the littl ring
with the turquois heart though oddli enough not her wed ring
and the string of small pearl which he had given her when thei were
marri and knew again by the clasp that wa fashion in a lover
knot of gold her voic too seem chang or rather he did not hear
her voic sinc it appear to speak within him in hi conscious
not without to hi ear she told him all sort of strang thing
about a wonder land in which thei would live togeth and the home
that she wa make readi for him and the tree and flower grow
around it that were unlik ani of which godfrei had ever heard also
she said that there were mani other matter whereof she would wish to
speak to him onli she might not
final there came a vivid dream in which she told him that soon he
would wake up to the world again for a littl while she seem to lai
emphasi on thi littl while and if he could not find her in it
that he must not griev at all sinc although their case seem sad
it wa much better than he could conceiv in hi dream she made him
promis that he would not griev and he did so wonder at thi she
smile look more beauti than ever he could have conceiv her to
be then she spoke these word alwai as it appear within him
print them as it were upon hi mind
now you ar about to wake up and i must leav you for a while but
thi i promis you my most dear my belov my own that befor you
fall asleep again for the last time you shall see me onc more for
that is allow to me inde it shall be i who will sooth you to
sleep and i who will receiv you when you awak again also in the
space between although you do not see me you will alwai feel me
near and i shall be with you so swear to me onc more that you will
not griev
then in hi vision godfrei swore and she appear to lean over him and
whisper word into hi ear that although thei impress themselv
upon hi brain as the other had done had no mean for him sinc
thei were in some languag which he did not understand
onli he knew that thei convei a bless to him and not that of
isobel alon
chapter xxi

godfrei awok and look about him he wa ly in a small room
opposit to an open window that had thin gauz shutter which as an
old indian he knew at onc were to keep out mosquito through thi
window he could see the mighti tower shape of the pyramid and
reflect that after all there must have been some truth in those
wonder dream he lift hi hand it wa so thin that the strong
sunlight shone through it he touch hi head and felt that it wa
wrap in bandag also that it seem benumb upon on side
a littl dark woman wear a nurs uniform enter the room and he
ask her where he wa as onc befor he had done in franc and under
veri similar condit she stare and answer with an irish accent

when he woke again it wa night and now the full moon such a moon as
on see in egypt shone upon the side of the great pyramid and made it
silver he could hear voic talk outsid hi door on that of the
irish nurs which he recognis and the other of a man for although
thei spoke low thi sens of hear seem to be peculiarli acut to
him

matter about someon whom he thought had been visit him he is as
reason as i am and much more than you ar save your presenc

then the voic di awai and godfrei almost laugh becaus thei had
talk of hi delus when he knew so well that it wa none isobel
had been with him ye although he could neither hear nor see her
isobel wa with him now for he felt her presenc and yet how could
thi be if he wa in egypt and she wa in england so wonder he
fell asleep again
by degre as he gather strength godfrei learn all the stori of
what had happen to him or rather so much of it as those in charg of
the hospit knew it appear accord to sister elizabeth as hi
nurs wa name that when he wa struck down in the church somewher

and were no more seen the chief jaga who had escap caus him to
be carri out of the burn church to the missionari hous and
sent runner to the nearest magistraci mani mile awai where there wa

as a hospit orderli had wash hi wound and bound them up on of
these that on the head wa caus by a kerri or some blunt
instrument and the other wa a spearstab in the lung also from time
to time thi servant pour milk down hi throat
at length the doctor came with an arm escort and greatli dare
perform some oper which reliev the pressur on the brain and
