introduct
in give to the world the record of what look at as an adventur
onli is i suppos on of the most wonder and mysteri experi
ever undergon by mortal men i feel it incumb on me to explain what
my exact connect with it is and so i mai as well sai at onc that i
am not the narrat but onli the editor of thi extraordinari histori
and then go on to tell how it found it wai into my hand
some year ago i the editor wa stop with a friend vir
doctissimu et amicu neu at a certain univers which for the
purpos of thi histori we will call cambridg and wa on dai much
struck with the appear of two person whom i saw go arminarm
down the street on of these gentlemen wa i think without except
the handsomest young fellow i have ever seen he wa veri tall veri
broad and had a look of power and a grace of bear that seem as
nativ to him as it is to a wild stag in addit hi face wa almost
without flawa good face as well as a beauti on and when he lift
hi hat which he did just then to a pass ladi i saw that hi head
wa cover with littl golden curl grow close to the scalp
good graciou i said to my friend with whom i wa walk why
that fellow look like a statu of apollo come to life what a splendid
man he is
ye he answer he is the handsomest man in the univers and on
of the nicest too thei call him the greek god but look at the other
on he vincei that the god name guardian and suppos to be
full of everi kind of inform thei call him charon i look
and found the older man quit as interest in hi wai as the glorifi
specimen of human at hi side he appear to be about forti year
of ag and wa i think as ugli as hi companion wa handsom to begin
with he wa shortish rather bowleg veri deep chest and with
unusu long arm he had dark hair and small ey and the hair grew
right down on hi forehead and hi whisker grew right up to hi hair
so that there wa uncommonli littl of hi counten to be seen
altogeth he remind me forcibl of a gorilla and yet there wa
someth veri pleas and genial about the man ey i rememb
sai that i should like to know him
all right answer my friend noth easier i know vincei
ill introduc you and he did and for some minut we stood
chattingabout the zulu peopl i think for i had just return from
the cape at the time present howev a stoutish ladi whose name
i do not rememb came along the pavement accompani by a pretti
fairhair girl and these two mr vincei who clearli knew them well
at onc join walk off in their compani i rememb be rather
amus becaus of the chang in the express of the elder man whose
name i discov wa holli when he saw the ladi advanc he
suddenli stop short in hi talk cast a reproach look at hi
companion and with an abrupt nod to myself turn and march off
alon across the street i heard afterward that he wa popularli
suppos to be as much afraid of a woman as most peopl ar of a mad
dog which account for hi precipit retreat i cannot sai howev
that young vincei show much avers to feminin societi on thi
occas inde i rememb laugh and remark to my friend at
the time that he wa not the sort of man whom it would be desir to
introduc to the ladi on wa go to marri sinc it wa exceedingli
probabl that the acquaint would end in a transfer of her
affect he wa altogeth too goodlook and what is more
he had none of that conscious and conceit about him which usual
afflict handsom men and make them deservedli dislik by their
fellow
that same even my visit came to an end and thi wa the last i saw
or heard of charon and the greek god for mani a long dai inde i
have never seen either of them from that hour to thi and do not think
it probabl that i shall but a month ago i receiv a letter and two
packet on of manuscript and on open the first found that it wa
sign by horac holli a name that at the moment wa not familiar to
me it ran as follow
colleg cambridg mai 1 18
my dear siryou will be surpris consid the veri slight natur
of our acquaint to get a letter from me inde i think i had
better begin by remind you that we onc met now some five year ago
when i and my ward leo vincei were introduc to you in the street at
cambridg to be brief and come to my busi i have recent
read with much interest a book of your describ a central african
adventur i take it that thi book is partli true and partli an effort
of the imagin howev thi mai be it ha given me an idea it
happen how you will see in the accompani manuscript which togeth
with the scarab the royal son of the sun and the origin sherd i
am send to you by hand that my ward or rather my adopt son leo
vincei and myself have recent pass through a real african adventur
of a natur so much more marvel than the on which you describ
that to tell the truth i am almost asham to submit it to you lest you
should disbeliev my tale you will see it state in thi manuscript
that i or rather we had made up our mind not to make thi histori
public dure our joint live nor should we alter our determin
were it not for a circumst which ha recent arisen we ar for
reason that after perus thi manuscript you mai be abl to guess
go awai again thi time to central asia where if anywher upon thi
earth wisdom is to be found and we anticip that our sojourn there
will be a long on possibl we shall not return under these alter
condit it ha becom a question whether we ar justifi in
withhold from the world an account of a phenomenon which we believ
to be of unparallel interest mere becaus our privat life is
involv or becaus we ar afraid of ridicul and doubt be cast
upon our statement i hold on view about thi matter and leo
hold anoth and final after much discuss we have come to a
compromis name to send the histori to you give you full leav to
publish it if you think fit the onli stipul be that you shall
disguis our real name and as much concern our person ident as
is consist with the mainten of the bona fide of the narr
and now what am i to sai further i realli do not know beyond onc more
repeat that everyth is describ in the accompani manuscript
exactli as it happen as regard she herself i have noth to add
dai by dai we gave greater occas to regret that we did not better
avail ourselv of our opportun to obtain more inform from
that marvel woman who wa she how did she first come to the cave
of kr and what wa her real religion we never ascertain and now
ala we never shall at least not yet these and mani other question
aris in my mind but what is the good of ask them now
will you undertak the task we give you complet freedom and as a
reward you will we believ have the credit of present to the world
the most wonder histori as distinguish from romanc that it
record can show read the manuscript which i have copi out fairli
for your benefit and let me know
believ me veri truli your l horac holli
psof cours if ani profit result from the sale of the write
should you care to undertak it public you can do what you
like with it but if there is a loss i will leav instruct with my
lawyer messr geoffrei and jordan to meet it we entrust the sherd
the scarab and the parchment to your keep till such time as we
demand them back again l h h
thi name is vari throughout in accord with the
writer requesteditor
thi letter as mai be imagin astonish me consider but when i
came to look at the ms which the pressur of other work prevent me
from do for a fortnight i wa still more astonish as i think the
reader will be also and at onc made up my mind to press on with the
matter i wrote to thi effect to mr holli but a week afterward
receiv a letter from that gentleman lawyer return my own with
the inform that their client and mr leo vincei had alreadi left
thi countri for thibet and thei did not at present know their address
well that is all i have to sai of the histori itself the reader must
judg i give it him with the except of a veri few alter
made with the object of conceal the ident of the actor from the
gener public exactli as it came to me person i have made up my
mind to refrain from comment at first i wa inclin to believ that
thi histori of a woman on whom cloth in the majesti of her almost
endless year the shadow of etern itself lai like the dark wing
of night wa some gigant allegori of which i could not catch the
mean then i thought that it might be a bold attempt to portrai the
possibl result of practic immort inform the substanc of
a mortal who yet drew her strength from earth and in whose human bosom
passion yet rose and fell and beat as in the undi world around her
the wind and the tide rise and fall and beat unceasingli but as i
went on i abandon that idea also to me the stori seem to bear the
stamp of truth upon it face it explan i must leav to other
and with thi slight prefac which circumst make necessari i
introduc the world to ayesha and the cave of krthe editor
psthere is on consider on circumst that after a reperus
of thi histori struck me with so much forc that i cannot resist
call the attent of the reader to it he will observ that so far
as we ar made acquaint with him there appear to be noth in the
charact of leo vincei which in the opinion of most peopl would have
been like to attract an intellect so power as that of ayesha he is
not even at ani rate to my view particularli interest inde on
might imagin that mr holli would under ordinari circumst have
easili outstrip him in the favour of she can it be that extrem
meet and that the veri excess and splendour of her mind led her by
mean of some strang physic reaction to worship at the shrine of
matter wa that ancient kallikr noth but a splendid anim
love for hi hereditari greek beauti or is the true explan what
i believ it to benam that ayesha see further than we can
see perceiv the germ and smoulder spark of great which lai hid
within her lover soul and well knew that under the influenc of her
gift of life water by her wisdom and shone upon with the sunshin
of her presenc it would bloom like a flower and flash out like a star
fill the world with light and fragranc
here also i am not abl to answer but must leav the reader to form hi
own judgment on the fact befor him as detail by mr holli in the
follow page
i
my visitor
there ar some event of which each circumst and surround detail
seem to be graven on the memori in such fashion that we cannot forget
it and so it is with the scene that i am about to describ it rise
as clearli befor my mind at thi moment as though it had happen but
yesterdai
it wa in thi veri month someth over twenti year ago that i ludwig
horac holli wa sit on night in my room at cambridg grind
awai at some mathemat work i forget what i wa to go up for my
fellowship within a week and wa expect by my tutor and my colleg
gener to distinguish myself at last weari out i flung my book
down and go to the mantelpiec took down a pipe and fill it
there wa a candl burn on the mantelpiec and a long narrow glass
at the back of it and as i wa in the act of light the pipe i caught
sight of my own counten in the glass and paus to reflect the
light match burnt awai till it scorch my finger forc me to drop
it but still i stood and stare at myself in the glass and reflect
well i said aloud at last it is to be hope that i shall be abl
to do someth with the insid of my head for i shall certainli never
do anyth by the help of the outsid
thi remark will doubtless strike anybodi who read it as be slightli
obscur but i wa in realiti allud to my physic defici
most men of twentytwo ar endow at ani rate with some share of the
comeli of youth but to me even thi wa deni short thickset
and deepchest almost to deform with long sinewi arm heavi
featur deepset grei ey a low brow half overgrown with a mop of
thick black hair like a desert clear on which the forest had onc
more begun to encroach such wa my appear nearli a quarter of a
centuri ago and such with some modif it is to thi dai
like cain i wa brandedbrand by natur with the stamp of abnorm
ugli as i wa gift by natur with iron and abnorm strength and
consider intellectu power so ugli wa i that the spruce
young men of my colleg though thei were proud enough of my feat of
endur and physic prowess did not even care to be seen walk
with me wa it wonder that i wa misanthrop and sullen wa it
wonder that i brood and work alon and had no friendsat least
onli on i wa set apart by natur to live alon and draw comfort
from her breast and her onli women hate the sight of me onli a week
befor i had heard on call me a monster when she thought i wa out
of hear and sai that i had convert her to the monkei theori onc
inde a woman pretend to care for me and i lavish all the pentup
affect of my natur upon her then monei that wa to have come to me
went elsewher and she discard me i plead with her as i have never
plead with ani live creatur befor or sinc for i wa caught by
her sweet face and love her and in the end by wai of answer she took
me to the glass and stood side by side with me and look into it
now she said if i am beauti who ar you that wa when i wa onli
twenti
and so i stood and stare and felt a sort of grim satisfact in the
sens of my own loneli for i had neither father nor mother nor
brother and as i did so there came a knock at my door
i listen befor i went to open it for it wa nearli twelv oclock at
night and i wa in no mood to admit ani stranger i had but on friend
in the colleg or inde in the worldperhap it wa he
just then the person outsid the door cough and i hasten to open
it for i knew the cough
a tall man of about thirti with the remain of great person beauti
came hurri in stagger beneath the weight of a massiv iron box
which he carri by a handl with hi right hand he place the box upon
the tabl and then fell into an aw fit of cough he cough and
cough till hi face becam quit purpl and at last he sank into
a chair and began to spit up blood i pour out some whiski into a
tumbler and gave it to him he drank it and seem better though hi
better wa veri bad inde
why did you keep me stand there in the cold he ask pettishli
you know the draught ar death to me
i did not know who it wa i answer you ar a late visitor
ye and i verili believ it is my last visit he answer with a
ghastli attempt at a smile i am done for holli i am done for i do
not believ that i shall see tomorrow
nonsens i said let me go for a doctor
he wave me back imperi with hi hand it is sober sens but i
want no doctor i have studi medicin and i know all about it no
doctor can help me my last hour ha come for a year past i have
onli live by a miracl now listen to me as you have never listen to
anybodi befor for you will not have the opportun of get me to
repeat my word we have been friend for two year now tell me how
much do you know about me

after the ag that most men leav it i know that you have been marri
and that your wife di and that you have been the best inde almost
the onli friend i ever had

rug tree you ar hard and sound at core listen the boi will be the
onli repres of on of the most ancient famili in the world
that is so far as famili can be trace you will laugh at me when
i sai it but on dai it will be prove to you beyond a doubt that my
sixtyfifth or sixtysixth lineal ancestor wa an egyptian priest
of isi though he wa himself of grecian extract and wa call
kallikr hi father wa on of the greek mercenari rais
by hakhor a mendesian pharaoh of the twentyninth dynasti and hi
grandfath or greatgrandfath i believ wa that veri kallikr
mention by herodotu in or about the year 339 befor christ just
at the time of the final fall of the pharaoh thi kallikr the
priest broke hi vow of celibaci and fled from egypt with a princess
of royal blood who had fallen in love with him and wa final wreck
upon the coast of africa somewher as i believ in the neighbourhood
of where delagoa bai now is or rather to the north of it he and hi
wife be save and all the remaind of their compani destroi in
on wai or anoth here thei endur great hardship but were at last

escap how i know not to athen bear a child with her whom she
name tisisthen or the mighti aveng five hundr year or more

aveng here too thei remain for anoth five centuri or more
till about 770 ad when charlemagn invad lombardi where thei were
then settl whereon the head of the famili seem to have attach
himself to the great emperor and to have return with him across the
alp and final to have settl in brittani eight gener later

great honour and power from that time to the present dai i can trace
my descent without a break not that the vinceysfor that wa the final
corrupt of the name after it bearer took root in english soilhav
been particularli distinguishedthei never came much to the fore
sometim thei were soldier sometim merchant but on the whole thei
have preserv a dead level of respect and a still deader level
of mediocr from the time of charl ii till the begin of the
present centuri thei were merchant about 1790 by grandfath made a
consider fortun out of brew and retir in 1821 he di and
my father succeed him and dissip most of the monei ten year ago

spartan spoken of by herodotu herod ix 72 as be
remark for hi beauti he fell at the gloriou battl of
plata septemb 22 bc 479 when the lacedmonian
and athenian under pausania rout the persian put

helotsl h h
he paus a while hi head sunk upon hi hand and then continu
my marriag had divert me from a project which i cannot enter into
now i have no time hollyi have no time on dai if you accept my
trust you will learn all about it after my wife death i turn my
mind to it again but first it wa necessari or at least i conceiv
that it wa necessari that i should attain to a perfect knowledg of
eastern dialect especi arab it wa to facilit my studi
that i came here veri soon howev my diseas develop itself and
now there is an end of me and as though to emphasis hi word he

and suppos i were to die i ask
then the boi must becom a ward of chanceri and take hi chanc onli
be care that the iron chest is pass on to him by your will listen
holli dont refus me believ me thi is to your advantag you ar
not fit to mix with the worldit would onli embitt you in a few
week you will becom a fellow of your colleg and the incom that you
will deriv from that combin with what i have left you will enabl you
to live a life of learn leisur altern with the sport of which
you ar so fond such as will exactli suit you
he paus and look at me anxious but i still hesit the charg
seem so veri strang
for my sake holli we have been good friend and i have no time to
make other arrang
veri well i said i will do it provid there is noth in thi
paper to make me chang my mind and i touch the envelop he had put
upon the tabl by the kei
thank you holli thank you there is noth at all swear to me by
god that you will be a father to the boi and follow my direct to
the letter
i swear it i answer solemnli
veri well rememb that perhap on dai i shall ask for the account of
your oath for though i am dead and forgotten yet i shall live there
is no such thing as death holli onli a chang and as you mai perhap
learn in time to come i believ that even that chang could under
certain circumst be indefinit postpon and again he broke
into on of hi dread fit of cough
there he said i must go you have the chest and my will will be
found among my paper under the author of which the child will be
hand over to you you will be well paid holli and i know that you
ar honest but if you betrai my trust by heaven i will haunt you
i said noth be inde too bewild to speak
he held up the candl and look at hi own face in the glass it had
been a beauti face but diseas had wreck it food for the worm
he said curiou to think that in a few hour i shall be stiff and
coldth journei done the littl game plai out ah me holli life
is not worth the troubl of life except when on is in loveat least
mine ha not been but the boi leo mai be if he ha the courag and
the faith goodby my friend and with a sudden access of tender
he flung hi arm about me and kiss me on the forehead and then turn
to go
look here vincei i said if you ar as ill as you think you had
better let me fetch a doctor
no no he said earnestli promis me that you wont i am go to
die and like a poison rat i wish to die alon
i dont believ that you ar go to do anyth of the sort i
answer he smile and with the word rememb on hi lip wa
gone as for myself i sat down and rub my ey wonder if i had
been asleep as thi supposit would not bear investig i gave it
up and began to think that vincei must have been drink i knew that
he wa and had been veri ill but still it seem imposs that he
could be in such a condit as to be abl to know for certain that he
would not outliv the night had he been so near dissolut sure he
would scarc have been abl to walk and carri a heavi iron box with
him the whole stori on reflect seem to me utterli incred
for i wa not then old enough to be awar how mani thing happen in
thi world that the common sens of the averag man would set down as
so improb as to be absolut imposs thi is a fact that i have
onli recent master wa it like that a man would have a son five
year of ag whom he had never seen sinc he wa a tini infant no wa
it like that he could foretel hi own death so accur no wa
it like that he could trace hi pedigre for more than three
centuri befor christ or that he would suddenli confid the absolut
guardianship of hi child and leav half hi fortun to a colleg
friend most certainli not clearli vincei wa either drunk or mad that
be so what did it mean and what wa in the seal iron chest
the whole thing baffl and puzzl me to such an extent that at last i
could stand it no longer and determin to sleep over it so i jump
up and have put the kei and the letter that vincei had left awai
into my despatchbox and stow the iron chest in a larg portmanteau
i turn in and wa soon fast asleep
as it seem to me i had onli been asleep for a few minut when i wa
awaken by somebodi call me i sat up and rub my ey it wa
broad daylighteight oclock in fact
why what is the matter with you john i ask of the gyp who wait
on vincei and myself you look as though you had seen a ghost
ye sir and so i have he answer leastwai iv seen a corps
which is wors iv been in to call mr vincei as usual and there he
li stark and dead
ii
the year roll by
as might be expect poor vincei sudden death creat a great stir
in the colleg but as he wa known to be veri ill and a satisfactori
doctor certif wa forthcom there wa no inquest thei were
not so particular about inquest in those dai as thei ar now inde
thei were gener dislik becaus of the scandal under all these
circumst be ask no question i did not feel call upon to
volunt ani inform about our interview on the night of vincei
deceas beyond sai that he had come into my room to see me as he
often did on the dai of the funer a lawyer came down from london and
follow my poor friend remain to the grave and then went back with
hi paper and effect except of cours the iron chest which had been
left in my keep for a week after thi i heard no more of the matter
and inde my attent wa ampli occupi in other wai for i wa
up for my fellowship a fact that had prevent me from attend the
funer or see the lawyer at last howev the examin wa
over and i came back to my room and sank into an easi chair with a
happi conscious that i had got through it veri fairli
soon howev my thought reliev of the pressur that had crush
them into a singl groov dure the last few dai turn to the event
of the night of poor vincei death and again i ask myself what it
all meant and wonder if i should hear anyth more of the matter
and if i did not what it would be my duti to do with the curiou iron
chest i sat there and thought and thought till i began to grow quit
disturb over the whole occurr the mysteri midnight visit the
propheci of death so shortli to be fulfil the solemn oath that i had
taken and which vincei had call on me to answer to in anoth world
than thi had the man commit suicid it look like it and what
wa the quest of which he spoke the circumst were uncanni so
much so that though i am by no mean nervou or apt to be alarm
at anyth that mai seem to cross the bound of the natur i grew
afraid and began to wish i had noth to do with them how much more
do i wish it now over twenti year afterward
as i sat and thought there came a knock at the door and a letter in a
big blue envelop wa brought in to me i saw at a glanc that it wa
a lawyer letter and an instinct told me that it wa connect with my
trust the letter which i still have run thu
sirour client the late m l vincei esq who di on the 9th
instant in colleg cambridg ha left behind him a will of which
you will pleas find copi enclos and of which we ar the executor
under thi will you will perceiv that you take a lifeinterest in about
half of the late mr vincei properti now invest in consol subject
to your accept of the guardianship of hi onli son leo vincei at
present an infant ag five had we not ourselv drawn up the document
in question in obedi to mr vincei clear and precis instruct
both person and written and had he not then assur us that he had
veri good reason for what he wa do we ar bound to tell you that
it provis seem to us of so unusu a natur that we should have
bound to call the attent of the court of chanceri to them in order
that such step might be taken as seem desir to it either by
contest the capac of the testat or otherwis to safeguard
the interest of the infant as it is know that the testat wa
a gentleman of the highest intellig and acumen and that he ha
absolut no relat live to whom he could have confid the
guardianship of the child we do not feel justifi in take thi
cours
await such instruct as you pleas to send us as regard
the deliveri of the infant and the payment of the proport of the
dividend due to you
we remain sir faithfulli your
geoffrei and jordan
horac l holli esq
i put down the letter and ran my ey through the will which appear
from it utter unintellig to have been drawn on the strictest
legal principl so far as i could discov howev it exactli bore
out what my friend vincei had told me on the night of hi death so
it wa true after all i must take the boi suddenli i rememb the
letter which vincei had left with the chest i fetch and open it
it onli contain such direct as he had alreadi given to me as to
open the chest on leo twentyfifth birthdai and laid down the
outlin of the boi educ which wa to includ greek the higher
mathemat and arab at the end there wa a postscript to the
effect that if the boi di under the ag of twentyf which
howev he did not believ would be the case i wa to open the chest
and act on the inform i obtain if i saw fit if i did not see
fit i wa to destroi all the content on no account wa i to pass them
on to a stranger
as thi letter ad noth materi to my knowledg and certainli
rais no further object in my mind to enter on the task i had
promis my dead friend to undertak there wa onli on cours open
to menam to write to messr geoffrei and jordan and express my
accept of the trust state that i should be will to commenc
my guardianship of leo in ten dai time thi done i went to the
author of my colleg and have told them as much of the stori
as i consid desir which wa not veri much after consider
difficulti succeed in persuad them to stretch a point and in the
event of my have obtain a fellowship which i wa pretti certain
i had done allow me to have the child to live with me their consent
howev wa onli grant on the condit that i vacat my room
in colleg and took lodg thi i did and with some difficulti
succeed in obtain veri good apart quit close to the colleg
gate the next thing wa to find a nurs and on thi point i came to a
determin i would have no woman to lord it over me about the child
and steal hi affect from me the boi wa old enough to do
without femal assist so i set to work to hunt up a suitabl male
attend with some difficulti i succeed in hire a most respect
roundfac young man who had been a helper in a huntingst but
who said that he wa on of a famili of seventeen and wellaccustom to
the wai of children and profess himself quit will to undertak
the charg of master leo when he arriv then have taken the iron
box to town and with my own hand deposit it at my banker i bought
some book upon the health and manag of children and read them
first to myself and then aloud to jobthat wa the young man
nameand wait
at length the child arriv in the charg of an elderli person who wept
bitterli at part with him and a beauti boi he wa inde i do
not think that i ever saw such a perfect child befor or sinc hi ey
were grei hi forehead wa broad and hi face even at that earli ag
clean cut as a cameo without be pinch or thin but perhap hi
most attract point wa hi hair which wa pure gold in colour and
tightli curl over hi shape head he cri a littl when hi nurs
final tore herself awai and left him with us never shall i forget the
scene there he stood with the sunlight from the window plai upon
hi golden curl hi fist screw over on ey whilst he took us in
with the other i wa seat in a chair and stretch out my hand to
him to induc him to come to me while job in the corner wa make a
sort of cluck nois which argu from hi previou experi or
from the analog of the hen he judg would have a sooth effect and
inspir confid in the youth mind and run a wooden hors of
peculiar hideous backward and forward in a wai that wa littl
short of inan thi went on for some minut and then all of a sudden
the lad stretch out both hi littl arm and ran to me
i like you he said you is ugli but you is good
ten minut afterward he wa eat larg slice of bread and butter
with everi sign of satisfact job want to put jam on to them but
i sternli remind him of the excel work that we had read and
forbad it
in a veri littl while for as i expect i got my fellowship the
boi becam the favourit of the whole collegewher all order and
regul to the contrari notwithstand he wa continu in
and outa sort of charter libertin in whose favour all rule were
relax the offer made at hi shrine were simpli without number
and i had seriou differ of opinion with on old resid fellow
now long dead who wa usual suppos to be the crustiest man in the
univers and to abhor the sight of a child and yet i discov
when a frequent recur fit of sick had forc job to keep a
strict lookout that thi unprincipl old man wa in the habit of
entic the boi to hi room and there feed him upon unlimit
quantiti of brandybal and make him promis to sai noth about
it job told him that he ought to be asham of himself at hi ag
too when he might have been a grandfath if he had done what wa
right by which job understood had got marri and thenc aros the
row
but i have no space to dwell upon those delight year around which
memori still fondli hover on by on thei went by and as thei pass
we two grew dearer and yet more dear to each other few son have
been love as i love leo and few father know the deep and continu
affect that leo bear to me
the child grew into the boi and the boi into the young man while on
by on the remorseless year flew by and as he grew and increas so
did hi beauti and the beauti of hi mind grow with him when he wa
about fifteen thei us to call him beauti about the colleg and me
thei nicknam the beast beauti and the beast wa what thei call us
when we went out walk togeth as we us to do everi dai onc leo
attack a great strap butcher man twice hi size becaus he
sang it out after us and thrash him toothrash him fairli i
walk on and pretend not to see till the combat got too excit
when i turn round and cheer him on to victori it wa the chaff of
the colleg at the time but i could not help it then when he wa a
littl older the undergradu found fresh name for us thei call me
charon and leo the greek god i will pass over my own appel with
the humbl remark that i wa never handsom and did not grow more so as
i grew older as for hi there wa no doubt about it fit leo at
twentyon might have stood for a statu of the youth apollo i never
saw anybodi to touch him in look or anybodi so absolut unconsci
of them as for hi mind he wa brilliant and keenwit but not a
scholar he had not the dul necessari for that result we follow
out hi father instruct as regard hi educ strictli enough
and on the whole the result especi in the matter of greek and
arab were satisfactori i learnt the latter languag in order to help
to teach it to him but after five year of it he knew it as well as i
didalmost as well as the professor who instruct us both i alwai
wa a great sportsmanit is my on passionand everi autumn we went
awai somewher shoot or fish sometim to scotland sometim
to norwai onc even to russia i am a good shot but even in thi he
learnt to excel me
when leo wa eighteen i move back into my room and enter him at my
own colleg and at twentyon he took hi degreea respect degre
but not a veri high on then it wa that i for the first time told
him someth of hi own stori and of the mysteri that loom ahead
of cours he wa veri curiou about it and of cours i explain to
him that hi curios could not be gratifi at present after that to
pass the time awai i suggest that he should get himself call to the
bar and thi he did read at cambridg and onli go up to london
to eat hi dinner
i had onli on troubl about him and that wa that everi young woman
who came across him or if not everi on nearli so would insist on
fall in love with him henc aros difficulti which i need not
enter into here though thei were troublesom enough at the time on the
whole he behav fairli well i cannot sai more than that
and so the time went by till at last he reach hi twentyfifth
birthdai at which date thi strang and in some wai aw histori
realli begin
iii
the sherd of amenarta
on the dai preced leo twentyfifth birthdai we both journei to
london and extract the mysteri chest from the bank where i had
deposit it twenti year befor it wa i rememb brought up by the
same clerk who had taken it down he perfectli rememb have hidden
it awai had he not done so he said he should have had difficulti in
find it it wa so cover up with cobweb
in the even we return with our preciou burden to cambridg and i
think that we might both of us have given awai all the sleep we got that
night and not have been much the poorer at daybreak leo arriv in my
room in a dressinggown and suggest that we should at onc proce to
busi i scout the idea as show an unworthi curios the chest
had wait twenti year i said so it could veri well continu to wait
until after breakfast accordingli at ninean unusu sharp ninew
breakfast and so occupi wa i with my own thought that i regret to
state that i put a piec of bacon into leo tea in mistak for a lump
of sugar job too to whom the contagion of excit had of cours
spread manag to break the handl off my svre china teacup the
ident on i believ that marat had been drink from just befor he
wa stab in hi bath
at last howev breakfast wa clear awai and job at my request
fetch the chest and place it upon the tabl in a somewhat gingerli
fashion as though he mistrust it then he prepar to leav the room
stop a moment job i said if mr leo ha no object i should
prefer to have an independ wit to thi busi who can be
reli upon to hold hi tongu unless he is ask to speak
certainli uncl horac answer leo for i had brought him up to
call me unclethough he vari the appel somewhat disrespectfulli
by call me old fellow or even my avuncular rel
job touch hi head not have a hat on
lock the door job i said and bring me my despatchbox
he obei and from the box i took the kei that poor vincei leo
father had given me on the night of hi death there were three of
them the largest a compar modern kei the second an exceedingli
ancient on and the third entir unlik anyth of the sort that we
had ever seen befor be fashion appar from a strip of solid
silver with a bar place across to serv as a handl and leav
some nick cut in the edg of the bar it wa more like a model of an
antediluvian railwai kei than anyth els
now ar you both readi i said as peopl do when thei ar go to
fire a mine there wa no answer so i took the big kei rub some
salad oil into the ward and after on or two bad shot for my hand
were shake manag to fit it and shoot the lock leo bent over and
caught the massiv lid in both hi hand and with an effort for the
hing had rust forc it back it remov reveal anoth case
cover with dust thi we extract from the iron chest without ani
difficulti and remov the accumul filth of year from it with a
clothesbrush
it wa or appear to be of eboni or some such closegrain black
wood and wa bound in everi direct with flat band of iron it
antiqu must have been extrem for the dens heavi wood wa in part
actual commenc to crumbl from ag
now for it i said insert the second kei
job and leo bent forward in breathless silenc the kei turn and
i flung back the lid and utter an exclam and no wonder for
insid the eboni case wa a magnific silver casket about twelv
inch squar by eight high it appear to be of egyptian workmanship
and the four leg were form of sphinx and the domeshap cover wa
also surmount by a sphinx the casket wa of cours much tarnish and
dint with ag but otherwis in fairli sound condit
i drew it out and set it on the tabl and then in the midst of the
most perfect silenc i insert the strangelook silver kei and
press thi wai and that until at last the lock yield and the casket
stood befor us it wa fill to the brim with some brown shred
materi more like veget fibr than paper the natur of which i
have never been abl to discov thi i carefulli remov to the depth
of some three inch when i came to a letter enclos in an ordinari
modernlook envelop and address in the handwrit of my dead
friend vincei
to my son leo should he live to open thi casket
i hand the letter to leo who glanc at the envelop and then put it
down upon the tabl make a motion to me to go on empti the casket
the next thing that i found wa a parchment carefulli roll up i
unrol it and see that it wa also in vincei handwrit and
head translat of the uncial greek write on the potsherd put
it down by the letter then follow anoth ancient roll of parchment
that had becom yellow and crinkl with the passag of year thi i
also unrol it wa likewis a translat of the same greek origin
but into blacklett latin which at the first glanc from the style
and charact appear to me to date from somewher about the begin
of the sixteenth centuri immedi beneath thi roll wa someth
hard and heavi wrap up in yellow linen and repos upon anoth
layer of the fibrou materi slowli and carefulli we unrol the
linen expos to view a veri larg but undoubtedli ancient potsherd
of a dirti yellow colour thi potsherd had in my judgment onc been
a part of an ordinari amphora of medium size for the rest it measur
ten and a half inch in length by seven in width wa about a quarter
of an inch thick and dens cover on the convex side that lai
toward the bottom of the box with write in the later uncial greek
charact fade here and there but for the most part perfectli
legibl the inscript have evid been execut with the
greatest care and by mean of a reed pen such as the ancient
often us i must not forget to mention that in some remot ag thi
wonder fragment had been broken in two and rejoin by mean of
cement and eight long rivet also there were numer inscript on
the inner side but these were of the most errat charact and had
clearli been made by differ hand and in mani differ ag and

that is all i said
veri well answer leo put down the miniatur at which he
had been gaze affection and now let us read the letter and
without further ado he broke the seal and read aloud as follow
my son leowhen you open thi if you ever live to do so you will
have attain to manhood and i shall have been long enough dead to
be absolut forgotten by nearli all who knew me yet in read it
rememb that i have been and for anyth you know mai still be and
that in it through thi link of pen and paper i stretch out my hand
to you across the gulf of death and my voic speak to you from the
silenc of the grave though i am dead and no memori of me remain
in your mind yet am i with you in thi hour that you read sinc your

such small arrang as i have to make for your futur wellb ar
complet it is my intent to put a period to them mai god forgiv me
if i do wrong at the best i could not live more than anoth year
so he kill himself i exclaim i thought so
and now leo went on without repli enough of myself what ha to
be said belong to you who live not to me who am dead and almost as
much forgotten as though i had never been holli my friend to whom if
he will accept the trust it is my intent to confid you will have
told you someth of the extraordinari antiqu of your race in
the content of thi casket you will find suffici to prove it the
strang legend that you will find inscrib by your remot ancestress
upon the potsherd wa commun to me by my father on hi deathb
and took a strong hold in my imagin when i wa onli nineteen year
of ag i determin as to hi misfortun did on of our ancestor
about the time of elizabeth to investig it truth into all that
befel me i cannot enter now but thi i saw with my own ey on the
coast of africa in a hitherto unexplor region some distanc to the
north of where the zambesi fall into the sea there is a headland
at the extrem of which a peak tower up shape like the head of a
negro similar to that of which the write speak i land there
and learnt from a wander nativ who had been cast out by hi peopl
becaus of some crime which he had commit that far inland ar great
mountain shape like cup and cave surround by measureless swamp
i learnt also that the peopl there speak a dialect of arab and ar
rule over by a beauti white woman who is seldom seen by them but
who is report to have power over all thing live and dead two
dai after i had ascertain thi the man di of fever contract
in cross the swamp and i wa forc by want of provis and by
symptom of an ill which afterward prostrat me to take to my dhow
again
of the adventur that befel me after thi i need not now speak i wa
wreck upon the coast of madagascar and rescu some month afterward
by an english ship that brought me to aden whenc i start for
england intend to prosecut my search as soon as i had made
suffici prepar on my wai i stop in greec and there for
omnia vincit amor i met your belov mother and marri her and
there you were born and she di then it wa that my last ill
seiz me and i return hither to die but still i hope against hope
and set myself to work to learn arab with the intent should i
ever get better of return to the coast of africa and solv
the mysteri of which the tradit ha live so mani centuri in our
famili but i have not got better and so far as i am concern the
stori is at an end
for you howev my son it is not at an end and to you i hand on
these the result of my labour togeth with the hereditari proof of
it origin it is my intent to provid that thei shall not be put
into your hand until you have reach an ag when you will be abl to
judg for yourself whether or no you will choos to investig what if
it is true must be the greatest mysteri in the world or to put it by
as an idl fabl origin in the first place in a woman disord
brain
i do not believ that it is a fabl i believ that if it can onli
be rediscov there is a spot where the vital forc of the world
visibl exist life exist why therefor should not the mean of
preserv it indefinit exist also but i have no wish to prejudic
your mind about the matter read and judg for yourself if you ar
inclin to undertak the search i have so provid that you will not
lack for mean if on the other hand you ar satisfi that the whole
thing is a chimera then i adjur you destroi the potsherd and the
write and let a caus of troubl be remov from our race for
ever perhap that will be wisest the unknown is gener taken to be
terribl not as the proverb would infer from the inher superstit
of man but becaus it so often is terribl he who would tamper with
the vast and secret forc that anim the world mai well fall a victim
to them and if the end were attain if at last you emerg from the
trial ever beauti and ever young defi time and evil and lift
abov the natur decai of flesh and intellect who shall sai that the
awesom chang would prove a happi on choos my son and mai the
power who rule all thing and who sai thu far shalt thou go and
thu much shalt thou learn direct the choic to your own happi
and the happi of the world which in the event of your success
you would on dai certainli rule by the pure forc of accumul
experi farewel
thu the letter which wa unsign and undat abruptli end
what do you make of that uncl holli said leo with a sort of gasp
as he replac it on the tabl we have been look for a mysteri and
we certainli seem to have found on
what do i make of it why that your poor dear father wa off hi head
of cours i answer testili i guess as much that night twenti
year ago when he came into my room you see he evid hurri hi
own end poor man it is absolut balderdash
that it sir said job solemnli job wa a most matteroffact
specimen of a matteroffact class
well let see what the potsherd ha to sai at ani rate said leo
take up the translat in hi father write and commenc to
read

kallikr the beauti in strength a priest of isi whom the
god cherish and the demon obei be about to die to my littl son
tisisthen the mighti aveng i fled with thy father from egypt in
the dai of nectaneb caus him through love to break the vow
that he had vow we fled southward across the water and we wander
for twice twelv moon on the coast of libya africa that look toward
the rise sun where by a river is a great rock carven like the head
of an ethiopian four dai on the water from the mouth of a mighti river
were we cast awai and some were drown and some di of sick but
us wild men took through wast and marsh where the sea fowl hid the
sky bear us ten dai journei till we came to a hollow mountain
where a great citi had been and fallen and where there ar cave of
which no man hath seen the end and thei brought us to the queen of the
peopl who place pot upon the head of stranger who is a magician
have a knowledg of all thing and life and loveli that doe not
die and she cast ey of love upon thy father kallikr and would
have slain me and taken him to husband but he love me and fear her
and would not then did she take us and lead us by terribl wai by
mean of dark magic to where the great pit is in the mouth of which
the old philosoph lai dead and show to us the roll pillar of
life that di not whereof the voic is as the voic of thunder and
she did stand in the flame and come forth unharm and yet more
beauti then did she swear to make thy father undi even as she is
if he would but slai me and give himself to her for me she could
not slai becaus of the magic of my own peopl that i have and that
prevail thu far against her and he held hi hand befor hi ey to
hide her beauti and would not then in her rage did she smite him by
her magic and he di but she wept over him and bore him thenc with
lament and be afraid me she sent to the mouth of the great
river where the ship come and i wa carri far awai on the ship
where i gave thee birth and hither to athen i came at last after mani
wander now i sai to thee my son tisisthen seek out the woman
and learn the secret of life and if thou mayest find a wai slai her
becaus of thy father kallikr and if thou dost fear or fail thi
i sai to all thy seed who come after thee till at last a brave man be
found among them who shall bath in the fire and sit in the place of the
pharaoh i speak of those thing that though thei be past belief yet
i have known and i lie not
nekhtnebf or nectanebo ii the last nativ pharaoh of
egypt fled from ochu to ethiopia bc 339editor
mai the lord forgiv her for that groan job who had been listen
to thi marvel composit with hi mouth open
as for myself i said noth my first idea be that my poor friend
be dement had compos the whole thing though it scarc seem
like that such a stori could have been invent by anybodi it wa too
origin to solv my doubt i took up the potsherd and began to read
the close uncial greek write on it and veri good greek of the period
it is consid that it came from the pen of an egyptian born here
is an exact transcript of it
the gener conveni in read i have here accur transcrib
thi inscript into the cursiv charact
the english translat wa as i discov on further investig
and as the reader mai easili see by comparison both accur and
eleg
besid the uncial write on the convex side of the sherd at the top
paint in dull red on what had onc been the lip of the amphora wa
the cartouch alreadi mention as be on the scarabu which we
had also found in the casket the hieroglyph or symbol howev
were revers just as though thei had been press on wax whether thi
wa the cartouch of the origin kallikr or of some princ or
pharaoh from whom hi wife amenarta wa descend i am not sure nor
can i tell if it wa drawn upon the sherd at the same time that the
uncial greek wa inscrib or copi on more recent from the scarab
by some other member of the famili nor wa thi all at the foot of
the write paint in the same dull red wa the faint outlin of a
somewhat rude draw of the head and shoulder of a sphinx wear
two feather symbol of majesti which though common enough upon the
effigi of sacr bull and god i have never befor met with on a
sphinx
the cartouch if it be a true cartouch cannot have
been that of kallikr as mr holli suggest kallikr
wa a priest and not entitl to a cartouch which wa the
prerog of egyptian royalti though he might have
inscrib hi name or titl upon an ovaleditor
also on the righthand side of thi surfac of the sherd paint
obliqu in red on the space not cover by the uncial charact and
sign in blue paint wa the follow quaint inscript
in earth and skie and sea
strang thyng ther be
hoc fecit
dorothea vincei
perfectli bewild i turn the relic over it wa cover from top
to bottom with note and signatur in greek latin and english the
first in uncial greek wa by tisisthen the son to whom the write
wa address it wa i could not go tisisthen to hi son
kallikr here it is in facsimil with it cursiv equival
thi kallikr probabl in the greek fashion so name after hi
grandfath evid made some attempt to start on the quest for hi
entri written in veri faint and almost illeg uncial is i ceas
from my go the god be against me kallikr to hi son here
it is also
between these two ancient write the second of which wa inscrib
upsid down and wa so faint and worn that had it not been for the
transcript of it execut by vincei i should scarc have been abl to
read it sinc ow to it have been written on that portion of the
tile which had in the cours of ag undergon the most handl it
wa nearli rub outwa the bold modernlook signatur of on
lionel vincei tate sua 17 which wa written thereon i think by
leo grandfath to the right of thi were the initi j b v
and below came a varieti of greek signatur in uncial and cursiv
charact and what appear to be some carelessli execut repetit
of the sentenc to my son show that the relic
wa religi pass on from gener to gener
the next legibl thing after the greek signatur wa the word
roma auc show that the famili had now migrat to rome
unfortun howev with the except of it termin evi the
date of their settlement there is for ever lost for just where it had
been place a piec of the potsherd is broken awai
then follow twelv latin signatur jot about here and there
wherev there wa a space upon the tile suitabl to their inscript
these signatur with three except onli end with the name
vindex or the aveng which seem to have been adopt by the
famili after it migrat to rome as a kind of equival to the greek
tisisthen which also mean an aveng ultim as might be
expect thi latin cognomen of vindex wa transform first into de
vincei and then into the plain modern vincei it is veri curiou
to observ how the idea of reveng inspir by an egyptian who live
befor the time of christ is thu as it were embalm in an english
famili name
a few of the roman name inscrib upon the sherd i have actual sinc
found mention in histori and other record thei were if i rememb
right
mvssiv vindex
sex variv marvllv
c fvfidiv c f vindex
and
laberia pompeiana conivx macrini vindici
thi last be of cours the name of a roman ladi
the follow list howev compris all the latin name upon the
sherd
c caeciliv vindex
m aimiliv vindex
sex variv marvllv
q sosiv priscv senecio vindex

c fvfidiv c f vindex
liciniv favstv
laberia pompeiana conivx macrini vindici
manilia lvcilla conivx marvlli vindici
after the roman name there is evid a gap of veri mani centuri
nobodi will ever know now what wa the histori of the relic dure those
dark ag or how it came to have been preserv in the famili my
poor friend vincei had it will be rememb told me that hi roman
ancestor final settl in lombardi and when charlemagn invad
it return with him across the alp and made their home in brittani
whenc thei cross to england in the reign of edward the confessor how
he knew thi i am not awar for there is no refer to lombardi or
charlemagn upon the tile though as will present be seen there is a
refer to brittani to continu the next entri on the sherd if i
mai except a long splash either of blood or red colour matter of
some sort consist of two cross drawn in red pigment and probabl
repres crusad sword and a rather neat monogram d v
in scarlet and blue perhap execut by that same dorothea vincei who
wrote or rather paint the doggrel couplet to the left of thi
inscrib in faint blue were the initi a v and after them a date
1800
then came what wa perhap as curiou an entri as anyth upon thi
extraordinari relic of the past it is execut in black letter written
over the cross or crusad sword and date fourteen hundr and
fortyf as the best plan will be to allow it to speak for itself i
here give the blacklett facsimil togeth with the origin latin
without the contract from which it will be seen that the writer
wa a fair mediv latinist also we discov what is still more
curiou an english version of the blacklett latin thi also
written in black letter we found inscrib on a second parchment that
wa in the coffer appar somewhat older in date than that on which
wa inscrib the mediv latin translat of the uncial greek of
which i shall speak present thi i also give in full
facsimil of blacklett inscript on the sherd of amenarta

the next and save on last entri wa elizabethan and date 1564 a
most strang histori and on that did cost my father hi life for in
seekyng for the place upon the east coast of africa hi pinnanc
wa sunk by a portugues galleon off lorenzo marquez and he himself
perishedjohn vincei
then came the last entri appar to judg by the style of
write made by some repres of the famili in the middl of the
eighteenth centuri it wa a misquot of the wellknown line in
hamlet and ran thu there ar more thing in heaven and earth than
ar dreamt of in your philosophi horatio
anoth thing that make me fix the date of thi entri
at the middl of the eighteenth centuri is that curious
enough i have an act copi of hamlet written about
1740 in which these two line ar misquot almost exactli
in the same wai and i have littl doubt but that the vincei
who wrote them on the potsherd heard them so misquot at
that date of cours the line realli run
there ar more thing in heaven and earth horatio
than ar dreamt of in your philosophyl h h

well i said when at length i had read out and carefulli examin
these write and paragraph at least those of them that were still
easili legibl that is the conclus of the whole matter leo and
now you can form your own opinion on it i have alreadi form mine
and what is it he ask in hi quick wai
it is thi i believ that potsherd to be perfectli genuin and that
wonder as it mai seem it ha come down in your famili from sinc
the fourth centuri befor christ the entri absolut prove it and
therefor howev improb it mai seem it must be accept but
there i stop that your remot ancestress the egyptian princess or
some scribe under her direct wrote that which we see on the sherd
i have no doubt nor have i the slightest doubt but that her suffer
and the loss of her husband had turn her head and that she wa not
right in her mind when she did write it
how do you account for what my father saw and heard there ask leo
coincid no doubt there ar bluff on the coast of africa that
look someth like a man head and plenti of peopl who speak bastard
arab also i believ that there ar lot of swamp anoth thing
is leo and i am sorri to sai it but i do not believ that your poor
father wa quit right when he wrote that letter he had met with
a great troubl and also he had allow thi stori to prei on hi
imagin and he wa a veri imagin man anywai i believ that
the whole thing is the most unmitig rubbish i know that there ar
curiou thing and forc in natur which we rare meet with and when
we do meet them cannot understand but until i see it with my own ey
which i am not like to i never will believ that there is ani mean
of avoid death even for a time or that there is or wa a white
sorceress live in the heart of an african swamp it is bosh my boi
all boshwhat do you sai job
i sai sir that it is a lie and if it is true i hope mr leo wont
meddl with no such thing for no good cant come of it
perhap you ar both right said leo veri quietli i express no
opinion but i sai thi i am go to set the matter at rest onc and
for all and if you wont come with me i will go by myself
i look at the young man and saw that he meant what he said when leo
mean what he sai he alwai put on a curiou look about the mouth it
ha been a trick of hi from a child now as a matter of fact i had no
intent of allow leo to go anywher by himself for my own sake if
not for hi i wa far too attach to him for that i am not a man
of mani ti or affect circumst have been against me in thi
respect and men and women shrink from me or at least i fanci that
thei do which come to the same thing think perhap that my
somewhat forbid exterior is a kei to my charact rather than
endur thi i have to a great extent seclud myself from the world
and cut myself off from those opportun which with most men result
in the format of relat more or less intim therefor leo wa
all the world to mebroth child and friendand until he weari of
me where he went there i should go too but of cours it would not do
to let him see how great a hold he had over me so i cast about for some
mean wherebi i might let myself down easi
ye i shall go uncl and if i dont find the roll pillar of
life at ani rate i shall get some firstclass shoot
here wa my opportun and i took it
shoot i said ah ye i never thought of that it must be a veri
wild stretch of countri and full of big game i have alwai want to
kill a buffalo befor i die do you know my boi i dont believ in the
quest but i do believ in big game and realli on the whole if after
think it over you make up your mind to go i will take a holidai
and come with you
ah said leo i thought that you would not lose such a chanc but
how about monei we shall want a good lot
you need not troubl about that i answer there is all your incom
that ha been accumul for year and besid that i have save
twothird of what your father left to me as i consid in trust for
you there is plenti of cash
veri well then we mai as well stow these thing awai and go up to
town to see about our gun by the wai job ar you come too it
time you began to see the world
well sir answer job stolidli i dont hold much with foreign
part but if both you gentlemen ar go you will want somebodi to
look after you and i am not the man to stop behind after serv you
for twenti year
that right job said i you wont find out anyth wonder but
you will get some good shoot and now look here both of you i wont
have a word said to a live soul about thi nonsens and i point
to the potsherd if it got out and anyth happen to me my next of
kin would disput my will on the ground of insan and i should becom
the laugh stock of cambridg
that dai three month we were on the ocean bound for zanzibar
iv
the squall
how differ is the scene that i have now to tell from that which ha
just been told gone ar the quiet colleg room gone the windswai
english elm the caw rook and the familiar volum on the shelv
and in their place there rise a vision of the great calm ocean gleam
in shade silver light beneath the beam of the full african moon a
gentl breez fill the huge sail of our dhow and draw us through
the water that rippl music against her side most of the men ar
sleep forward for it is near midnight but a stout swarthi arab
mahom by name stand at the tiller lazili steer by the star
three mile or more to our starboard is a low dim line it is the
eastern shore of central africa we ar run to the southward befor
the north east monsoon between the mainland and the reef that for
hundr of mile fring thi peril coast the night is quiet so
quiet that a whisper can be heard fore and aft the dhow so quiet that a
faint boom sound roll across the water to us from the distant land
the arab at the tiller hold up hi hand and sai on wordsimba
lion
we all sit up and listen then it come again a slow majest sound
that thrill us to the marrow
tomorrow by ten oclock i sai we ought if the captain is not out
in hi reckon which i think veri probabl to make thi mysteri
rock with a man head and begin our shoot
and begin our search for the ruin citi and the fire of life
correct leo take hi pipe from hi mouth and laugh a littl
nonsens i answer you were air your arab with that man at
the tiller thi afternoon what did he tell you he ha been trade
slavetrad probabl up and down these latitud for half of hi
iniquit life and onc land on thi veri man rock did he ever
hear anyth of the ruin citi or the cave
no answer leo he sai that the countri is all swamp behind and
full of snake especi python and game and that no man live
there but then there is a belt of swamp all along the east african
coast so that doe not go for much
ye i said it doesit goe for malaria you see what sort of an
opinion these gentri have of the countri not on of them will go with
us thei think that we ar mad and upon my word i believ that thei ar
right if ever we see old england again i shall be astonish howev
it doe not greatli matter to me at my ag but i am anxiou for you
leo and for job it a tom fool busi my boi
all right uncl horac so far as i am concern i am will to take
my chanc look what is that cloud and he point to a dark blotch
upon the starri sky some mile astern of us
go and ask the man at the tiller i said
he rose stretch hi arm and went present he return
he sai it is a squall but it will pass far on on side of us
just then job came up look veri stout and english in hi
shootingsuit of brown flannel and with a sort of perplex appear
upon hi honest round face that had been veri common with him sinc he
got into these strang water
pleas sir he said touch hi sun hat which wa stuck on to the
back of hi head in a somewhat ludicr fashion as we have got all
those gun and thing in the whaleboat astern to sai noth of the
provis in the locker i think it would be best if i got down and
slept in her i dont like the look here he drop hi voic to a
portent whisper of these black gentri thei have such a wonder
thievish wai about them suppos now that some of them were to slip
into the boat at night and cut the cabl and make off with her that
would be a pretti go that would
the whaleboat i mai explain wa on special built for us at dunde
in scotland we had brought it with us as we knew that thi coast wa a
network of creek and that we might requir someth to navig
them with she wa a beauti boat thirtyfeet in length with a
centreboard for sail copperbottom to keep the worm out of her
and full of watertight compart the captain of the dhow had told
us that when we reach the rock which he knew and which appear to
be ident with the on describ upon the sherd and by leo father
he would probabl not be abl to run up to it on account of the shallow
and breaker therefor we had emploi three hour that veri morn
whilst we were total becalm the wind have drop at sunris
in transfer most of our good and chattel to the whaleboat
and place the gun ammunit and preserv provis in the
watertight locker special prepar for them so that when we did
sight the fabl rock we should have noth to do but step into the
boat and run her ashor anoth reason that induc us to take thi
precautionari step wa that arab captain ar apt to run past the point
that thei ar make either from careless or ow to a mistak in
it ident now as sailor know it is quit imposs for a dhow
which is onli rig to run befor the monsoon to beat back against it
therefor we got our boat readi to row for the rock at ani moment
well job i said perhap it would be as well there ar lot of
blanket there onli be care to keep out of the moon or it mai turn
your head or blind you
lord sir i dont think it would much matter if it did it is that
turn alreadi with the sight of these blackamoor and their filthi
thiev wai thei ar onli fit for muck thei ar and thei smell bad
enough for it alreadi
job it will be perceiv wa no admir of the manner and custom of
our darkskin brother
accordingli we haul up the boat by the towrop till it wa right
under the stern of the dhow and job bundl into her with all the grace
of a fall sack of potato then we return and sat down on the deck
again and smoke and talk in littl gust and jerk the night wa so
love and our brain were so full of suppress excit of on sort
and anoth that we did not feel inclin to turn in for nearli an
hour we sat thu and then i think we both doze off at least i have
a faint recollect of leo sleepili explain that the head wa not a
bad place to hit a buffalo if you could catch him exactli between the
horn or send your bullet down hi throat or some nonsens of the
sort
then i rememb no more till suddenlya fright roar of wind a
shriek of terror from the awaken crew and a whiplik sting of water
in our face some of the men ran to let go the haulyard and lower the
sail but the parrel jam and the yard would not come down i sprang
to my feet and hung on to a rope the sky aft wa dark as pitch but the
moon still shone brightli ahead of us and lit up the black beneath
it sheen a huge whitetop breaker twenti feet high or more wa
rush on to us it wa on the breakth moon shone on it crest and
tip it foam with light on it rush beneath the inki sky driven by
the aw squall behind it suddenli in the twinkl of an ey i saw
the black shape of the whaleboat cast high into the air on the crest of
the break wave thena shock of water a wild rush of boil foam
and i wa cling for my life to the shroud ay swept straight out
from it like a flag in a gale
we were poop
the wave pass it seem to me that i wa under water for
minutesr it wa second i look forward the blast had torn out
the great sail and high in the air it wa flutter awai to leeward
like a huge wound bird then for a moment there wa compar calm
and in it i heard job voic yell wildli come here to the boat
bewild and halfdrown as i wa i had the sens to rush aft i
felt the dhow sink under mesh wa full of water under her counter
the whaleboat wa toss furious and i saw the arab mahom who
had been steer leap into her i gave on desper pull at the
towrop to bring the boat alongsid wildli i sprang also job caught
me by the arm and i roll into the bottom of the boat down went the
dhow bodili and as she did so mahom drew hi curv knife and sever
the fibrerop by which we were fast to her and in anoth second we
were drive befor the storm over the place where the dhow had been
great god i shriek where is leo leo leo
he gone sir god help him roar job into my ear and such wa the
furi of the squall that hi voic sound like a whisper
i wrung my hand in agoni leo wa drown and i wa left aliv to
mourn him
look out yell job here come anoth
i turn a second huge wave wa overtak us i half hope that it
would drown me with a curiou fascin i watch it aw advent
the moon wa nearli hidden now by the wreath of the rush storm but
a littl light still caught the crest of the devour breaker there
wa someth dark on ita piec of wreckag it wa on us now and
the boat wa nearli full of water but she wa built in airtight
compartmentsheaven bless the man who invent themand lift up
through it like a swan through the foam and turmoil i saw the black
thing on the wave hurri right at me i put out my right arm to ward
it from me and my hand close on anoth arm the wrist of which my
finger grip like a vice i am a veri strong man and had someth
to hold to but my arm wa nearli torn from it socket by the strain and
weight of the float bodi had the rush last anoth two second i
might either have let go or gone with it but it pass leav us up
to our knee in water
bail out bail out shout job suit the action to the word
but i could not bail just then for as the moon went out and left us in
total dark on faint fly rai of light lit upon the face of the
man i had grip who wa now half ly half float in the bottom
of the boat
it wa leo leo brought back by the waveback dead or aliv from the
veri jaw of death
bail out bail out yell job or we shall founder
i seiz a larg tin bowl with a handl to it which wa fix under on
of the seat and the three of us bail awai for dear life the furiou
tempest drove over and round us fling the boat thi wai and that
the wind and the storm wreath and the sheet of sting sprai blind
and bewild us but through it all we work like demon with the
wild exhilar of despair for even despair can exhilar on
minut three minut six minut the boat began to lighten and no
fresh wave swamp us five minut more and she wa fairli clear
then suddenli abov the aw shriek of the hurrican came a
duller deeper roar great heaven it wa the voic of breaker
at that moment the moon began to shine forth againthi time behind the
path of the squall out far across the torn bosom of the ocean shot the
rag arrow of her light and there half a mile ahead of us wa a
white line of foam then a littl space of openmouth black and
then anoth line of white it wa the breaker and their roar grew
clearer and yet more clear as we sped down upon them like a swallow
there thei were boil up in snowi spout of sprai smite and
gnash togeth like the gleam teeth of hell
take the tiller mahom i roar in arab we must try and shoot
them at the same moment i seiz an oar and got it out motion to
job to do likewis
mahom clamber aft and got hold of the tiller and with some
difficulti job who had sometim pull a tub upon the home cam got
out hi oar in anoth minut the boat head wa straight on to the
evernear foam toward which she plung and tore with the speed
of a racehors just in front of us the first line of breaker seem
a littl thinner than to the right or leftther wa a cap of rather
deeper water i turn and point to it
steer for your life mahom i yell he wa a skil steersman
and well acquaint with the danger of thi most peril coast and i
saw him grip the tiller bend hi heavi frame forward and stare at the
foam terror till hi big round ey look as though thei would start
out of hi head the send of the sea wa drive the boat head round
to starboard if we struck the line of breaker fifti yard to starboard
of the gap we must sink it wa a great field of twist spout
wave mahom plant hi foot against the seat befor him and
glanc at him i saw hi brown toe spread out like a hand with the
weight he put upon them as he took the strain of the tiller she came
round a bit but not enough i roar to job to back water whilst i
drag and labour at my oar she answer now and none too soon
heaven we were in them and then follow a coupl of minut of
heartbreak excit such as i cannot hope to describ all that i
rememb is a shriek sea of foam out of which the billow rose here
there and everywher like aveng ghost from their ocean grave onc
we were turn right round but either by chanc or through mahom
skil steer the boat head came straight again befor a breaker
fill us on morea monster we were through it or over itmor
through than overand then with a wild yell of exult from the
arab we shot out into the compar smooth water of the mouth of sea
between the teethlik line of gnash wave
but we were nearli full of water again and not more than half a mile
ahead wa the second line of breaker again we set to and bail
furious fortun the storm had now quit gone by and the moon
shone brightli reveal a rocki headland run half a mile or more
out into the sea of which thi second line of breaker appear to be
a continu at ani rate thei boil around it foot probabl the
ridg that form the headland ran out into the ocean onli at a lower
level and made the reef also thi headland wa termin by a curiou
peak that seem not to be more than a mile awai from us just as we got
the boat pretti clear for the second time leo to my immens relief
open hi ey and remark that the cloth had tumbl off the bed
and that he suppos it wa time to get up for chapel i told him to
shut hi ey and keep quiet which he did without in the slightest
degre realiz the posit as for myself hi refer to chapel
made me reflect with a sort of sick long on my comfort room
at cambridg why had i been such a fool as to leav them thi is a
reflect that ha sever time recur to me sinc and with an
everincreas forc
but now again we were drift down on the breaker though with
lessen speed for the wind had fallen and onli the current or the
tide it afterward turn out to be the tide wa drive us
anoth minut and with a sort of howl to allah from the arab a piou
ejacul from myself and someth that wa not piou from job
we were in them and then the whole scene down to our final escap
repeat itself onli not quit so violent mahom skil steer
and the airtight compart save our live in five minut we were
through and driftingfor we were too exhaust to do anyth to
help ourselv except keep her head straightwith the most startl
rapid round the headland which i have describ
round we went with the tide until we got well under the lee of the
point and then suddenli the speed slacken we ceas to make wai
and final appear to be in dead water the storm had entir pass
leav a cleanwash sky behind it the headland intercept the heavi
sea that had been occas by the squall and the tide which had
been run so fierc up the river for we were now in the mouth of a
river wa sluggish befor it turn so we float quietli and befor
the moon went down manag to bail out the boat thoroughli and get her
a littl shipshap leo wa sleep profoundli and on the whole i
thought it wise not to wake him it wa true he wa sleep in wet
cloth but the night wa now so warm that i thought and so did job
that thei were not like to injur a man of hi unusu vigor
constitut besid we had no dry on at hand
present the moon went down and left us float on the water now
onli heav like some troubl woman breast with leisur to reflect
upon all that we had gone through and all that we had escap job
station himself at the bow mahom kept hi post at the tiller and i
sat on a seat in the middl of the boat close to where leo wa ly
the moon went slowli down in chasten loveli she depart like
some sweet bride into her chamber and long veillik shadow crept up
the sky through which the star peep shyli out soon howev thei
too began to pale befor a splendour in the east and then the quiver
footstep of the dawn came rush across the newborn blue and shook
the high star from their place quieter and yet more quiet grew the
sea quiet as the soft mist that brood on her bosom and cover up
her troubl as the illus wreath of sleep brood upon a painrack
mind caus it to forget it sorrow from the east to the west
sped the angel of the dawn from sea to sea from mountaintop to
mountaintop scatter light with both their hand on thei sped out
of the dark perfect gloriou like spirit of the just break
from the tomb on over the quiet sea over the low coastlin and the
swamp beyond and the mountain abov them over those who slept in
peac and those who woke in sorrow over the evil and the good over the
live and the dead over the wide world and all that breath or ha
breath thereon
it wa a wonderfulli beauti sight and yet sad perhap from the
veri excess of it beauti the aris sun the set sun there we
have the symbol and the type of human and all thing with which
human ha to do the symbol and the type ye and the earthli
begin and the end also and on that morn thi came home to me
with a peculiar forc the sun that rose todai for us had set last
night for eighteen of our fellowvoyagershad set everlastingli for
eighteen whom we knew
the dhow had gone down with them thei were toss about among the
rock and seawe so much human drift on the great ocean of death and
we four were save but on dai a sunris will come when we shall be
among those who ar lost and then other will watch those gloriou
rai and grow sad in the midst of beauti and dream of death in the
full glow of aris life
for thi is the lot of man
v
the head of the ethiopian
at length the herald and forerunn of the royal sun had done their
work and search out the shadow had caus them to flee awai
then up he came in glori from hi oceanb and flood the earth
with warmth and light i sat there in the boat listen to the gentl
lap of the water and watch him rise till present the slight
drift of the boat brought the oddshap rock or peak at the end of
the promontori which we had weather with so much peril between me
and the majest sight and blot it from my view i still continu
howev to stare at the rock absent enough till present it becam
edg with the fire of the grow light behind it and then i start
as well i might for i perceiv that the top of the peak which wa
about eighti feet high by on hundr and fifti feet thick at it base
wa shape like a negro head and face whereon wa stamp a most
fiendish and terrifi express there wa no doubt about it there
were the thick lip the fat cheek and the squat nose stand out
with startl clear against the flame background there too wa
the round skull wash into shape perhap by thousand of year of
wind and weather and to complet the resembl there wa a scrubbi
growth of weed or lichen upon it which against the sun look for all
the world like the wool on a coloss negro head it certainli wa
veri odd so odd that now i believ it is not a mere freak of natur but
a gigant monument fashion like the wellknown egyptian sphinx by a
forgotten peopl out of a pile of rock that lent itself to their
design perhap as an emblem of warn and defianc to ani enemi who
approach the harbour unfortun we were never abl to ascertain
whether or not thi wa the case inasmuch as the rock wa difficult of
access both from the land and the watersid and we had other thing
to attend to myself consid the matter by the light of what we
afterward saw i believ that it wa fashion by man but whether or
not thi is so there it stand and sullenli stare from ag to ag out
across the chang seather it stood two thousand year and more
ago when amenarta the egyptian princess and the wife of leo remot
ancestor kallikr gaze upon it devilish faceand there i have no
doubt it will still stand when as mani centuri as ar number between
her dai and our own ar ad to the year that bore us to oblivion
what do you think of that job i ask of our retain who wa
sit on the edg of the boat try to get as much sunshin as
possibl and gener look uncommonli wretch and i point to
the fieri and demon head
oh lord sir answer job who now perceiv the object for the first
time i think that the old geneleman must have been sit for hi
portrait on them rock
i laugh and the laugh woke up leo
hullo he said what the matter with me i am all stiffwher is
the dhow give me some brandi pleas
you mai be thank that you ar not stiffer my boi i answer the
dhow is sunk everybodi on board her is drown with the except of
us four and your own life wa onli save by a miracl and whilst job
now that it wa light enough search about in a locker for the brandi
for which leo ask i told him the histori of our night adventur
great heaven he said faintli and to think that we should have been
chosen to live through it
by thi time the brandi wa forthcom and we all had a good pull at
it and thank enough we were for it also the sun wa begin to
get strength and warm our chill bone for we had been wet through
for five hour or more
why said leo with a gasp as he put down the brandi bottl there
is the head the write talk of the rock carven like the head of an
ethiopian
ye i said there it is
well then he answer the whole thing is true
i dont see at all that that follow i answer we knew thi head
wa here your father saw it veri like it is not the same head that
the write talk of or if it is it prove noth
leo smile at me in a superior wai you ar an unbeliev jew uncl
horac he said those who live will see
exactli so i answer and now perhap you will observ that we ar
drift across a sandbank into the mouth of the river get hold of your
oar job and we will row in and see if we can find a place to land
the river mouth which we were enter did not appear to be a veri wide
on though as yet the long bank of steam mist that clung about
it shore had not lift suffici to enabl us to see it exact
measur there wa as is the case with nearli everi east african river
a consider bar at the mouth which no doubt when the wind wa on
shore and the tide run out wa absolut impass even for a
boat draw onli a few inch but as thing were it wa manag
enough and we did not ship a cup of water in twenti minut we were
well across it with but slight assist from ourselv and be
carri by a strong though somewhat variabl breez well up the harbour
by thi time the mist wa be suck up by the sun which wa get
uncomfort hot and we saw that the mouth of the littl estuari wa
here about half a mile across and that the bank were veri marshi and
crowd with crocodil ly about on the mud like log about a mile
ahead of us howev wa what appear to be a strip of firm land and
for thi we steer in anoth quarter of an hour we were there and
make the boat fast to a beauti tree with broad shine leav and
flower of the magnolia speci onli thei were rosecolour and
not white which hung over the water we disembark thi done we
undress wash ourselv and spread our cloth togeth with the
content of the boat in the sun to dry which thei veri quickli did
then take shelter from the sun under some tree we made a hearti
breakfast off a paysandu pot tongu of which we had brought a good
quantiti with us congratul ourselv loudli on our good fortun
in have load and provis the boat on the previou dai befor the
hurrican destroi the dhow by the time that we had finish our meal
our cloth were quit dry and we hasten to get into them feel
not a littl refresh inde with the except of weari and
a few bruis none of us were the wors for the terrifi adventur
which had been fatal to all our companion leo it is true had been
halfdrown but that is no great matter to a vigor young athlet of
fiveandtwenti
there is a known speci of magnolia with pink flower
it is indigen in sikkim and known as magnolia
campbelliieditor
after breakfast we start to look about us we were on a strip of dry
land about two hundr yard broad by five hundr long border on on
side by the river and on the other three by endless desol swamp
that stretch as far as the ey could reach thi strip of land wa
rais about twentyf feet abov the plain of the surround swamp
and the river level inde it had everi appear of have been made
by the hand of man
thi place ha been a wharf said leo dogmat
nonsens i answer who would be stupid enough to build a wharf
in the middl of these dread marsh in a countri inhabit by
savagesthat is if it is inhabit at all
perhap it wa not alwai marsh and perhap the peopl were not
alwai savag he said drili look down the steep bank for we were
stand by the river look there he went on point to a spot
where the hurrican of the previou night had torn up on of the
magnolia tree by the root which had grown on the extrem edg of the
bank just where it slope down to the water and lift a larg cake of
earth with them is not that stonework if not it is veri like it
nonsens i said again but we clamber down to the spot and got
between the upturn root and the bank
well he said
but i did not answer thi time i onli whistl for there laid bare by
the remov of the earth wa an undoubt face of solid stone laid in
larg block and bound togeth with brown cement so hard that i could
make no impress on it with the file in my shootingknif nor wa
thi all see someth project through the soil at the bottom of
the bare patch of wall i remov the loos earth with my hand and
reveal a huge stone ring a foot or more in diamet and about three
inch thick thi fairli stagger me
look rather like a wharf where goodsiz vessel have been moor
doe it not uncl horac said leo with an excit grin
i tri to sai nonsens again but the word stuck in my throatth
ring spoke for itself in some past ag vessel had been moor there
and thi stone wall wa undoubtedli the remnant of a solidli construct
wharf probabl the citi to which it had belong lai buri beneath the
swamp behind it
begin to look as though there were someth in the stori after all
uncl horac said the exult leo and reflect on the mysteri
negro head and the equal mysteri stonework i made no direct
repli
a countri like africa i said is sure to be full of the relic
of long dead and forgotten civilis nobodi know the ag of the
egyptian civilis and veri like it had offshoot then there were
the babylonian and the phnician and the persian and all manner
of peopl all more or less civilis to sai noth of the jew whom
everybodi want nowadai it is possibl that thei or ani on of
them mai have had coloni or trade station about here rememb
those buri persian citi that the consul show us at kilwa
near kilwa on the east coast of africa about 400 mile south of
zanzibar is a cliff which ha been recent wash by the wave on the
top of thi cliff ar persian tomb known to be at least seven centuri
old by the date still legibl upon them beneath these tomb is a layer
of dbri repres a citi farther down the cliff is a second
layer repres an older citi and farther down still a third layer
the remain of yet anoth citi of vast and unknown antiqu
beneath the bottom citi were recent found some specimen of glaze
earthenwar such as ar occasion to be met with on that coast to
thi dai i believ that thei ar now in the possess of sir john
kirkeditor
quit so said leo but that is not what you said befor
well what is to be done now i ask turn the convers
as no answer wa forthcom we walk to the edg of the swamp and
look over it it wa appar boundless and vast flock of
everi sort of waterfowl flew from it recess till it wa sometim
difficult to see the sky now that the sun wa get high it drew thin
sickli look cloud of poison vapour from the surfac of the marsh
and from the scummi pool of stagnant water
two thing ar clear to me i said address my three companion
who stare at thi spectacl in dismai first that we cant go across
there i point to the swamp and secondli that if we stop here we
shall certainli die of fever
that as clear as a haystack sir said job
veri well then there ar two altern befor us on is to bout
ship and try and run for some port in the whaleboat which would be
a suffici riski proceed and the other to sail or row on up the
river and see where we come to
i dont know what you ar go to do said leo set hi mouth
but i am go up that river
job turn up the white of hi ey and groan and the arab murmur
allah and groan also as for me i remark sweetli that as we
seem to be between the devil and the deep sea it did not much matter
where we went but in realiti i wa as anxiou to proce as leo the
coloss negro head and the stone wharf had excit my curios to an
extent of which i wa secretli asham and i wa prepar to gratifi it
at ani cost accordingli have carefulli fit the mast restow
the boat and got out our rifl we embark fortun the wind
wa blow on shore from the ocean so we were abl to hoist the sail
inde we afterward found out that as a gener rule the wind set on
shore from daybreak for some hour and off shore again at sunset and
the explan that i offer of thi is that when the earth is cool
by the dew and the night the hot air rise and the draught rush in
from the sea till the sun ha onc more heat it through at least that
appear to be the rule here
take advantag of thi favour wind we sail merrili up the river
for three or four hour onc we came across a school of hippopotami
which rose and bellow dreadfulli at us within ten or a dozen fathom
of the boat much to job alarm and i will confess to my own these
were the first hippopotami that we had ever seen and to judg by their
insati curios i should judg that we were the first white men
that thei had ever seen upon my word i onc or twice thought that thei
were come into the boat to gratifi it leo want to fire at them
but i dissuad him fear the consequ also we saw hundr of
crocodil bask on the muddi bank and thousand upon thousand
of waterfowl some of these we shot and among them wa a wild goos
which in addit to the sharpcurv spur on it wing had a spur
about threequart of an inch long grow from the skull just between
the ey we never shot anoth like it so i do not know if it wa
a sport or a distinct speci in the latter case thi incid mai
interest naturalist job name it the unicorn goos
about middai the sun grew intens hot and the stench drawn up by it
from the marsh which the river drain wa someth too aw and
caus us instantli to swallow precautionari dose of quinin shortli
afterward the breez di awai altogeth and as row our heavi boat
against stream in the heat wa out of the question we were thank
enough to get under the shade of a group of treesa speci of
willowthat grew by the edg of the river and lie there and gasp till
at length the approach of sunset put a period to our miseri see
what appear to be an open space of water straight ahead of us we
determin to row there befor settl what to do for the night just
as we were about to loosen the boat howev a beauti waterbuck
with great horn curv forward and a white stripe across the rump
came down to the river to drink without perceiv us hidden awai
within fifti yard under the willow leo wa the first to catch sight
of it and be an ardent sportsman thirst for the blood of
big game about which he had been dream for month he instantli
stiffen all over and point like a setter dog see what wa the
matter i hand him hi express rifl at the same time take my own
now then i whisper mind you dont miss
miss he whisper back contemptu i could not miss it if i
tri
he lift the rifl and the roancolour buck have drunk hi fill
rais hi head and look out across the river he wa stand right
against the sunset sky on a littl emin or ridg of ground which
ran across the swamp evid a favourit path for game and there
wa someth veri beauti about him inde i do not think that if
i live to a hundr i shall ever forget that desol and yet most
fascin scene it is stamp upon my memori to the right and
left were wide stretch of lone deathbreed swamp unbroken and
unreliev so far as the ey could reach except here and there by pond
of black and peati water that mirrorlik flash up the red rai
of the set sun behind us and befor stretch the vista of the
sluggish river end in glimps of a reedfring lagoon on the
surfac of which the long light of the even plai as the faint
breez stir the shadow to the west loom the huge red ball of the
sink sun now vanish down the vapouri horizon and fill the
great heaven high across whose arch the crane and wildfowl stream
in line squar and triangl with flash of fly gold and the lurid
stain of blood and then ourselvesthre modern englishmen in a
modern english boatseem to jar upon and look out of tone with that
measureless desol and in front of us the nobl buck limn out
upon a background of ruddi sky
bang awai he goe with a mighti bound leo ha miss him bang
right under him again now for a shot i must have on though he is
go like an arrow and a hundr yard awai and more by jove over
and over and over well i think iv wipe your ey there master
leo i sai struggl against the ungener exult that in such
a suprem moment of on exist will rise in the bestmann
sportsman breast
confound you ye growl leo and then with that quick smile that
is on of hi charm light up hi handsom face like a rai of light
i beg your pardon old fellow i congratul you it wa a love
shot and mine were vile
we got out of the boat and ran to the buck which wa shot through the
spine and stone dead it took us a quarter of an hour or more to clean
it and cut off as much of the best meat as we could carri and
have pack thi awai we had bare light enough to row up into the
lagoonlik space into which there be a hollow in the swamp the
river here expand just as the light vanish we cast anchor about
thirti fathom from the edg of the lake we did not dare to go ashor
not know if we should find dry ground to camp on and greatli fear
the poison exhal from the marsh from which we thought we
should be freer on the water so we light a lantern and made our
even meal off anoth pot tongu in the best fashion that we
could and then prepar to go to sleep onli howev to find that
sleep wa imposs for whether thei were attract by the lantern
or by the unaccustom smell of a white man for which thei had been
wait for the last thousand year or so i know not but certainli we
were present attack by ten of thousand of the most bloodthirsti
pertinaci and huge mosquito that i ever saw or read of in cloud
thei came and ping and buzz and bit till we were nearli mad
tobacco smoke onli seem to stir them into a merrier and more activ
life till at length we were driven to cover ourselv with blanket
head and all and sit to slowli stew and continu scratch and
swear beneath them and as we sat suddenli roll out like thunder
through the silenc came the deep roar of a lion and then of a second
lion move among the reed within sixti yard of us
i sai said leo stick hi head out from under hi blanket lucki
we aint on the bank eh avuncular leo sometim address me in
thi disrespect wai curs it a mosquito ha bitten me on the
nose and the head vanish again
shortli after thi the moon came up and notwithstand everi varieti
of roar that echo over the water to us from the lion on the bank we
began think ourselv perfectli secur to gradual doze off
i do not quit know what it wa that made me poke my head out of the
friendli shelter of the blanket perhap becaus i found that the
mosquito were bite right through it anyhow as i did so i heard job
whisper in a frighten voic
oh my star look there
instantli we all of us look and thi wa what we saw in the
moonlight near the shore were two wide and everwiden circl of
concentr ring rippl awai across the surfac of the water and in
the heart and centr of the circl were two dark move object
what is it ask i
it is those damn lion sir answer job in a tone which wa
an odd mixtur of a sens of person injuri habitu respect and
acknowledg fear and thei ar swim here to heat us he ad
nervous pick up an h in hi agit
i look again there wa no doubt about it i could catch the glare of
their feroci ey attract either by the smell of the newli kill
waterbuck meat or of ourselv the hungri beast were actual storm
our posit
leo alreadi had hi rifl in hi hand i call to him to wait till thei
were nearer and meanwhil grab my own some fifteen feet from us
the water shallow on a bank to the depth of about fifteen inch and
present the first of themit wa the lionessgot on to it shook
herself and roar at that moment leo fire the bullet went right
down her open mouth and out at the back of her neck and down she
drop with a splash dead the other liona fullgrown malewa
some two pace behind her at thi second he got hi forepaw on to the
bank when a strang thing happen there wa a rush and disturb
of the water such as on see in a pond in england when a pike take a
littl fish onli a thousand time fiercer and larger and suddenli the
lion gave a most terrif snarl roar and sprang forward on to the
bank drag someth black with him
allah shout mahom a crocodil ha got him by the leg and sure
enough he had we could see the long snout with it gleam line of
teeth and the reptil bodi behind it
and then follow an extraordinari scene inde the lion manag to
get well on to the bank the crocodil half stand and half swim
still nip hi hind leg he roar till the air quiver with the
sound and then with a savag shriek snarl turn round and claw
hold of the crocodil head the crocodil shift hi grip have
as we afterward discov had on of hi ey torn out and slightli
turn over instantli the lion got him by the throat and held on and
then over and over thei roll upon the bank struggl hideous it
wa imposs to follow their movement but when next we got a clear
view the tabl had turn for the crocodil whose head seem to be
a mass of gore had got the lion bodi in hi iron jaw just abov the
hip and wa squeez him and shake him to and fro for hi part
the tortur brute roar in agoni wa claw and bite madli
at hi enemi scali head and fix hi great hind claw in the
crocodil compar speak soft throat rip it open as on
would rip a glove
then all of a sudden the end came the lion head fell forward on the
crocodil back and with an aw groan he di and the crocodil
after stand for a minut motionless slowli roll over on to hi
side hi jaw still fix across the carcas of the lion which we
afterward found he had bitten almost in halv
thi duel to the death wa a wonder and a shock sight and on
that i suppos few men have seenand thu it end
when it wa all over leav mahom to keep a look out we manag to
spend the rest of the night as quietli as the mosquito would allow
vi
an earli christian ceremoni
next morn at the earliest light of dawn we rose perform such
ablut as circumst would allow and gener made readi to
start i am bound to sai that when there wa suffici light to enabl
us to see each other face i for on burst out into a roar of
laughter job fat and comfort counten wa swollen out to
nearli twice it natur size from mosquito bite and leo condit
wa not much better inde of the three i had come off much the best
probabl ow to the tough of my dark skin and to the fact that
a good deal of it wa cover by hair for sinc we had start from
england i had allow my natur luxuri beard to grow at it
own sweet will but the other two were compar speak clean
shave which of cours gave the enemi a larger extent of open countri
to oper on though in mahom case the mosquito recognis the
tast of a true believ would not touch him at ani price how often
i wonder dure the next week or so did we wish that we were flavour
like an arab
by the time that we had done laugh as heartili as our swollen lip
would allow it wa daylight and the morn breez wa come up from
the sea cut lane through the dens marsh mist and here and there
roll them befor it in great ball of fleeci vapour so we set
our sail and have first taken a look at the two dead lion and the
allig which we were of cours unabl to skin be destitut of
mean of cure the pelt we start and sail through the lagoon
follow the cours of the river on the farther side at middai when
the breez drop we were fortun enough to find a conveni piec
of dry land on which to camp and light a fire and here we cook two
wildduck and some of the waterbuck fleshnot in a veri appetis
wai it is true but still suffici the rest of the buck flesh
we cut into strip and hung in the sun to dry into biltong as i
believ the south african dutch call flesh thu prepar on thi
welcom patch of dry land we stop till the follow dawn and as
befor spent the night in warfar with the mosquito but without
other troubl the next dai or two pass in similar fashion and
without notic adventur except that we shot a specimen of a
peculiarli grace hornless buck and saw mani varieti of waterlili
in full bloom some of them blue and of exquisit beauti though few
of the flower were perfect ow to the preval of a white
watermaggot with a green head that fed upon them
it wa on the fifth dai of our journei when we had travel so far
as we could reckon about on hundr and thirtyf to a hundr and
forti mile westward from the coast that the first event of ani real
import occur on that morn the usual wind fail us about
eleven oclock and after pull a littl wai we were forc to halt
more or less exhaust at what appear to be the junction of our
stream with anoth of a uniform width of about fifti feet some tree
grew near at handth onli tree in all thi countri were along the
bank of the river and under these we rest and then the land be
fairli dry just here walk a littl wai along the edg of the river to
prospect and shoot a few waterfowl for food befor we had gone fifti
yard we perceiv that all hope of get further up the stream in
the whaleboat were at an end for not two hundr yard abov where
we had stop were a success of shallow and mudbank with not six
inch of water over them it wa a wateri cul de sac
turn back we walk some wai along the bank of the other river and
soon came to the conclus from variou indic that it wa not
a river at all but an ancient canal like the on which is to be seen
abov mombasa on the zanzibar coast connect the tana river with
the ozi in such a wai as to enabl the ship come down the tana
to cross to the ozi and reach the sea by it and thu avoid the veri
danger bar that block the mouth of the tana the canal befor us
had evid been dug out by man at some remot period of the world
histori and the result of hi dig still remain in the shape of
the rais bank that had no doubt onc form towingpath except here
and there where thei had been hollow out by the water or fallen in
these bank of stiff bind clai were at a uniform distanc from each
other and the depth of the stream also appear to be uniform current
there wa littl or none and as a consequ the surfac of the
canal wa choke with veget growth intersect by littl path
of clear water made i suppos by the constant passag of waterfowl
iguana and other vermin now as it wa evid that we could not
proce up the river it becam equal evid that we must either try
the canal or els return to the sea we could not stop where we were
to be bake by the sun and eaten up by the mosquito till we di of
fever in that dreari marsh
well i suppos that we must try it i said and the other assent
in their variou waysleo as though it were the best joke in the
world job in respect disgust and mahom with an invoc to
the prophet and a comprehens curs upon all unbeliev and their
wai of thought and travel
accordingli as soon as the sun got low have littl or noth more
to hope for from our friendli wind we start for the first hour or so
we manag to row the boat though with great labour but after that the
weed got too thick to allow of it and we were oblig to resort to the
primit and most exhaust resourc of tow her for two hour we
labour mahom job and i who wa suppos to be strong enough to
pull against the two of them on the bank while leo sat in the bow of
the boat and brush awai the weed which collect round the cutwat
with mahom sword at dark we halt for some hour to rest and enjoi
the mosquito but about midnight we went on again take advantag
of the compar cool of the night at dawn we rest for three hour
and then start onc more and labour on till about ten oclock when
a thunderstorm accompani by a delug of rain overtook us and we
spent the next six hour practic under water
i do not know that there is ani necess for me to describ the next
four dai of our voyag in detail further than to sai that thei were
on the whole the most miser that i ever spent in my life form
on monoton record of heavi labour heat miseri and mosquito all
that dreari wai we pass through a region of almost endless swamp and
i can onli attribut our escap from fever and death to the constant
dose of quinin and purg which we took and the unceas toil
which we were forc to undergo on the third dai of our journei up the
canal we had sight a round hill that loom dimli through the vapour
of the marsh and on the even of the fourth night when we camp
thi hill seem to be within fiveandtwenti or thirti mile of us we
were by now utterli exhaust and felt as though our blister hand
could not pull the boat a yard farther and that the best thing that
we could do would be to lie down and die in that dread wilder of
swamp it wa an aw posit and on in which i trust no other white
man will ever be place and as i threw myself down in the boat to sleep
the sleep of utter exhaust i bitterli curs my folli in ever have
been a parti to such a mad undertak which could i saw onli end in
our death in thi ghastli land i thought i rememb as i slowli sank
into a doze of what the appear of the boat and her unhappi crew
would be in two or three month time from that night there she would
lie with gape seam and half fill with ftid water which when
the mistladen wind stir her would wash backward and forward
through our moulder bone and that would be the end of her and of
those in her who would follow after myth and seek out the secret of
natur
alreadi i seem to hear the water rippl against the desicc bone
and rattl them togeth roll my skull against mahom and
hi against mine till at last mahom stood straight up upon it
vertebr and glare at me through it empti eyehol and curs me
with it grin jaw becaus i a dog of a christian disturb the
last sleep of a true believ i open my ey and shudder at the
horrid dream and then shudder again at someth that wa not a
dream for two great ey were gleam down at me through the misti
dark i struggl up and in my terror and confus shriek and
shriek again so that the other sprang up too reel and drunken
with sleep and fear and then all of a sudden there wa a flash of cold
steel and a great spear wa held against my throat and behind it other
spear gleam cruelli
peac said a voic speak in arab or rather in some dialect
into which arab enter veri larg who ar ye who come hither
swim on the water speak or ye die and the steel press sharpli
against my throat send a cold chill through me
we ar travel and have come hither by chanc i answer in my
best arab which appear to be understood for the man turn hi
head and address a tall form that tower up in the background
said father shall we slai
what is the colour of the men said a deep voic in answer
white is their colour
slai not wa the repli four sun sinc wa the word brought to me
from shewhomustbeobei white men come if white men
come slai them not let them be brought to the hous of
shewhomustbeobei bring forth the men and let that which thei
have with them be brought forth also
come said the man half lead and half drag me from the boat
and as he did so i perceiv other men do the same kind offic to my
companion
on the bank were gather a compani of some fifti men in that light all
i could make out wa that thei were arm with huge spear were veri
tall and strongli built compar light in colour and nude save
for a leopard skin ti round the middl
present leo and job were bundl out and place besid me
what on earth is up said leo rub hi ey
oh lord sir here a rum go ejacul job and just at that
moment a disturb ensu and mahom came tumbl between us
follow by a shadowi form with an uplift spear

shewhomustbeobei about the black on
she said naught but slai him not come hither my son
the man advanc and the tall shadowi form bent forward and whisper
someth
ye ye said the other and chuckl in a rather bloodcurdl
tone
ar the three white men there ask the form
ye thei ar there
then bring up that which is made readi for them and let the men take
all that can be brought from the thing which float
hardli had he spoken when men came run up carri on their
shoulder neither more nor less than palanquinsfour bearer and two
spare men to a palanquinand in these it wa promptli indic we were
expect to stow ourselv
well said leo it is a bless to find anybodi to carri us after
have to carri ourselv so long
leo alwai take a cheer view of thing
there be no help for it after see the other into their i
tumbl into my own litter and veri comfort i found it it appear
to be manufactur of cloth woven from grassfibr which stretch and
yield to everi motion of the bodi and be bound top and bottom to
the bear pole gave a grate support to the head and neck
scarc had i settl myself when accompani their step with a
monoton song the bearer start at a swing trot for half an
hour or so i lai still reflect on the veri remark experi
that we were go through and wonder if ani of my emin
respect fossil friend down at cambridg would believ me if i were
to be miracul set at the familiar dinnert for the purpos
of relat them i do not want to convei ani disrespect notion or
slight when i call those good and learn men fossil but my experi
is that peopl ar apt to fossilis even at a univers if thei follow
the same path too persist i wa get fossilis myself but
of late my stock of idea ha been veri much enlarg well i lai and
reflect and wonder what on earth would be the end of it all till
at last i ceas to wonder and went to sleep
i suppos i must have slept for seven or eight hour get the first
real rest that i had had sinc the night befor the loss of the
dhow for when i woke the sun wa high in the heaven we were still
journei on at a pace of about four mile an hour peep out through
the mistlik curtain of the litter which were ingeni fix to
the bear pole i perceiv to my infinit relief that we had pass
out of the region of etern swamp and were now travel over
swell grassi plain toward a cupshap hill whether or not it wa
the same hill that we had seen from the canal i do not know and have
never sinc been abl to discov for as we afterward found out
these peopl will give littl inform upon such point next i
glanc at the men who were bear me thei were of a magnific
build few of them be under six feet in height and yellowish in
colour gener their appear had a good deal in common with that
of the east african somali onli their hair wa not frizz up but hung
in thick black lock upon their shoulder their featur were aquilin
and in mani case exceedingli handsom the teeth be especi
regular and beauti but notwithstand their beauti it struck me
that on the whole i had never seen a more evillook set of face
there wa an aspect of cold and sullen cruelti stamp upon them
that revolt me and which in some case wa almost uncanni in it
intens
anoth thing that struck me about them wa that thei never seem to
smile sometim thei sang the monoton song of which i have spoken
but when thei were not sing thei remain almost perfectli silent
and the light of a laugh never came to brighten their sombr and evil
counten of what race could these peopl be their languag wa a
bastard arab and yet thei were not arab i wa quit sure of that
for on thing thei were too dark or rather yellow i could not sai why
but i know that their appear fill me with a sick fear of which
i felt asham while i wa still wonder anoth litter came up
alongsid of mine in itfor the curtain were drawnsat an old man
cloth in a whitish robe made appar from coars linen that hung
loos about him who i at onc jump to the conclus wa
the shadowi figur that had stood on the bank and been address as
father he wa a wonderfullook old man with a snowi beard so
long that the end of it hung over the side of the litter and he had
a hook nose abov which flash out a pair of ey as keen as a
snake while hi whole counten wa instinct with a look of wise
and sardon humour imposs to describ on paper
art thou awak stranger he said in a deep and low voic
sure my father i answer courteous feel certain that i
should do well to concili thi ancient mammon of unright
he stroke hi beauti white beard and smile faintli
from whatev countri thou camest he said and by the wai it must
be from on where somewhat of our languag is known thei teach their
children courtesi there my stranger son and now wherefor comest thou
unto thi land which scarc an alien foot ha press from the time
that man knoweth art thou and those with thee weari of life
we came to find new thing i answer boldli we ar tire of
the old thing we have come up out of the sea to know that which
is unknown we ar of a brave race who fear not death my veri much
respect fatherthat is if we can get a littl inform befor we
die
humph said the old gentleman that mai be true it is rash to
contradict otherwis i should sai that thou wast ly my son
howev i dare to sai that shewhomustbeobei will meet thy
wish in the matter
who is shewhomustbeobei i ask curious
the old man glanc at the bearer and then answer with a littl
smile that somehow sent my blood to my heart
sure my stranger son thou wilt learn soon enough if it be her
pleasur to see thee at all in the flesh
in the flesh i answer what mai my father wish to convei
but the old man onli laugh a dread laugh and made no repli
what is the name of my father peopl i ask
the name of my peopl is amahagg the peopl of the rock
and if a son might ask what is the name of my father
my name is billali
and whither go we my father
that shalt thou see and at a sign from him hi bearer start
forward at a run till thei reach the litter in which job wa repos
with on leg hang over the side appar howev he could not
make much out of job for present i saw hi bearer trot forward to
leo litter
and after that as noth fresh occur i yield to the pleasant
swai motion of the litter and went to sleep again i wa dreadfulli
tire when i woke i found that we were pass through a rocki defil
of a lava format with precipit side in which grew mani beauti
tree and flower shrub
present thi defil took a turn and a love sight unfold itself
to my ey befor us wa a vast cup of green from four to six mile in
extent in the shape of a roman amphitheatr the side of thi great
cup were rocki and cloth with bush but the centr wa of the richest
meadow land stud with singl tree of magnific growth and
water by meander brook on thi rich plain graze herd of goat
and cattl but i saw no sheep at first i could not imagin what thi
strang spot could be but present it flash upon me that it must
repres the crater of some longextinct volcano which had afterward
been a lake and wa ultim drain in some unexplain wai and
here i mai state that from my subsequ experi of thi and a much
larger but otherwis similar spot which i shall have occas to
describ byandbi i have everi reason to believ that thi conclus
wa correct what puzzl me howev wa that although there were
peopl move about herd the goat and cattl i saw no sign of ani
human habit where did thei all live i wonder my curios wa
soon destin to be gratifi turn to the left the string of litter
follow the cliffi side of the crater for a distanc of about half
a mile or perhap a littl less and then halt see the old
gentleman my adopt father billali emerg from hi litter i did
the same and so did leo and job the first thing i saw wa our wretch
arab companion mahom ly exhaust on the ground it appear that
he had not been provid with a litter but had been forc to run the
entir distanc and as he wa alreadi quit worn out when we start
hi condit now wa on of great prostrat
on look round we discov that the place where we had halt wa
a platform in front of the mouth of a great cave and pile upon thi
platform were the entir content of the whaleboat even down to the
oar and sail round the cave stood group of the men who had escort
us and other men of a similar stamp thei were all tall and all
handsom though thei vari in their degre of dark of skin some
be as dark as mahom and some as yellow as a chines thei were
nake except for the leopardskin round the waist and each of them
carri a huge spear
there were also some women among them who instead of the leopardskin
wore a tan hide of a small red buck someth like that of the
orib onli rather darker in colour these women were as a class
exceedingli goodlook with larg dark ey wellcut featur and
a thick bush of curl hairnot crisp like a negrosrang from
black to chestnut in hue with all shade of intermedi colour some
but veri few of them wore a yellowish linen garment such as i have
describ as worn by billali but thi as we afterward discov wa
a mark of rank rather than an attempt at cloth for the rest their
appear wa not quit so terrifi as that of the men and thei
sometim though rare smile as soon as we had alight thei
gather round us and examin us with curios but without
excit leo tall athlet form and clearcut grecian face
howev evid excit their attent and when he polit lift
hi hat to them and show hi curl yellow hair there wa a slight
murmur of admir nor did it stop there for after regard him
critic from head to foot the handsomest of the young womenon
wear a robe and with hair of a shade between brown and
chestnutdeliber advanc to him and in a wai that would have
been win had it not been so determin quietli put her arm round
hi neck bent forward and kiss him on the lip
i gave a gasp expect to see leo instantli spear and job
ejacul the hussywel i never as for leo he look slightli
astonish and then remark that we had clearli got into a countri
where thei follow the custom of the earli christian deliber
return the embrac
again i gasp think that someth would happen but to my
surpris though some of the young women show trace of vexat the
older on and the men onli smile slightli when we came to understand
the custom of thi extraordinari peopl the mysteri wa explain it
then appear that in direct opposit to the habit of almost everi
other savag race in the world women among the amahagg ar not onli
upon term of perfect equal with the men but ar not held to them by
ani bind ti descent is trace onli through the line of the
mother and while individu ar as proud of a long and superior femal
ancestri as we ar of our famili in europ thei never pai attent
to or even acknowledg ani man as their father even when their male
parentag is perfectli well known there is but on titular male parent
of each tribe or as thei call it household and he is it elect
and immedi ruler with the titl of father for instanc the man
billali wa the father of thi household which consist of about
seven thousand individu all told and no other man wa ever call
by that name when a woman took a fanci to a man she signifi her
prefer by advanc and embrac him publicli in the same wai that
thi handsom and exceedingli prompt young ladi who wa call ustan
had embrac leo if he kiss her back it wa a token that he accept
her and the arrang continu until on of them weari of it i
am bound howev to sai that the chang of husband wa not nearli so
frequent as might have been expect nor did quarrel aris out
of it at least among the men who when their wive desert them
in favour of a rival accept the whole thing much as we accept the
incometax or our marriag law as someth not to be disput and as
tend to the good of the commun howev disagre thei mai in
particular instanc prove to the individu
it is veri curiou to observ how the custom of mankind on thi matter
vari in differ countri make moral an affair of latitud and
what is right and proper in on place wrong and improp in anoth it
must howev be understood that sinc all civilis nation appear to
accept it as an axiom that ceremoni is the touchston of moral there
is even accord to our canon noth immor about thi amahagg
custom see that the interchang of the embrac answer to our
ceremoni of marriag which as we know justifi most thing
vii
ustan sing
when the kiss oper wa finishedbi the wai none of the young
ladi offer to pet me in thi fashion though i saw on hover
round job to that respect individu evid alarmth old man
billali advanc and gracious wave us into the cave whither we
went follow by ustan who did not seem inclin to take the hint i
gave her that we like privaci
befor we had gone five pace it struck me that the cave that we were
enter wa none of natur handiwork but on the contrari had been
hollow by the hand of man so far as we could judg it appear to
be about on hundr feet in length by fifti wide and veri lofti
resembl a cathedr aisl more than anyth els from thi main
aisl open passag at a distanc of everi twelv or fifteen feet
lead i suppos to smaller chamber about fifti feet from the
entranc of the cave just where the light began to get dim a fire wa
burn which threw huge shadow upon the gloomi wall around here
billali halt and ask us to be seat sai that the peopl would
bring us food and accordingli we squat ourselv down upon the
rug of skin which were spread for us and wait present the food
consist of goat flesh boil fresh milk in an earthenwar pot and
boil cob of indian corn wa brought by young girl we were almost
starv and i do not think that i ever in my life befor at with
such satisfact inde befor we had finish we liter at up
everyth that wa set befor us
when we had done our somewhat saturnin host billali who had been
watch us in perfect silenc rose and address us he said that it
wa a wonder thing that had happen no man had ever known or heard
of white stranger arriv in the countri of the peopl of the rock
sometim though rare black men had come here and from them thei
had heard of the exist of men much whiter than themselv who
sail on the sea in ship but for the arriv of such there wa no
preced we had howev been seen drag the boat up the canal
and he told us frankli that he had at onc given order for our
destruct see that it wa unlaw for ani stranger to enter here
when a messag had come from shewhomustbeobei sai that our
live were to be spare and that we were to be brought hither
pardon me my father i interrupt at thi point but if as i
understand shewhomustbeobei live yet farther off how could
she have known of our approach
billali turn and see that we were alonefor the young ladi
ustan had withdrawn when he had begun to speaksaid with a curiou
littl laugh
ar there none in your land who can see without ey and hear without
ear ask no question she knew
i shrug my shoulder at thi and he proceed to sai that no further
instruct had been receiv on the subject of our dispos and thi
be so he wa about to start to interview shewhomustbeobei
gener spoken of for the sake of breviti as hiya or she simpli
who he gave us to understand wa the queen of the amahagg and learn
her wish
i ask him how long he propos to be awai and he said that by
travel hard he might be back on the fifth dai but there were mani
mile of marsh to cross befor he came to where she wa he then said
that everi arrang would be made for our comfort dure hi absenc
and that as he person had taken a fanci to us he sincer trust
that the answer he should bring from she would be on favour to
the continu of our exist but at the same time he did not wish
to conceal from us that he thought thi doubt as everi stranger
who had ever come into the countri dure hi grandmoth life hi
mother life and hi own life had been put to death without merci
and in a wai he would not harrow our feel by describ and thi
had been done by the order of she herself at least he suppos that
it wa by her order at ani rate she never interf to save them
why i said but how can that be you ar an old man and the time
you talk of must reach back three men live how therefor could she
have order the death of anybodi at the begin of the life of your
grandmoth see that herself she would not have been born
again he smiledthat same faint peculiar smile and with a deep bow
depart without make ani answer nor did we see him again for five
dai
when he had gone we discuss the situat which fill me with
alarm i did not at all like the account of thi mysteri queen
shewhomustbeobei or more shortli she who appar
order the execut of ani unfortun stranger in a fashion so
unmerci leo too wa depress about it but consol himself by
triumphantli point out that thi she wa undoubtedli the person
refer to in the write on the potsherd and in hi father letter
in proof of which he advanc billali allus to her ag and power
i wa by thi time too overwhelm with the whole cours of event that
i had not even the heart left to disput a proposit so absurd so i
suggest that we should try to go out and get a bath of which we all
stood sadli in need
accordingli have indic our wish to a middleag individu of
an unusu saturnin cast of counten even among thi saturnin
peopl who appear to be deput to look after us now that the father
of the hamlet had depart we start in a bodyhav first lit
our pipe outsid the cave we found quit a crowd of peopl evid
watch for our appear but when thei saw us come out smoke thei
vanish thi wai and that call out that we were great magician
inde noth about us creat so great a sensat as our tobacco
smokenot even our firearm after thi we succeed in reach
a stream that had it sourc in a strong ground spring and take our
bath in peac though some of the women not except ustan show a
decid inclin to follow us even there
we found tobacco grow in thi countri as it doe in
everi other part of africa and although thei were so
absolut ignor of it other bless qualiti the
amahagg us it habitu in the form of snuff and also
for medicin purposesl h h
by the time that we had finish thi most refresh bath the sun wa
set inde when we got back to the big cave it had alreadi set
the cave itself wa full of peopl gather round firesfor sever
more had now been lightedand eat their even meal by their lurid
light and by that of variou lamp which were set about or hung upon
the wall these lamp were of a rude manufactur of bake earthenwar
and of all shape some of them grace enough the larger on were
form of big red earthenwar pot fill with clarifi melt fat
and have a reed wick stuck through a wooden disk which fill the top
of the pot thi sort of lamp requir the most constant attent to
prevent it go out whenev the wick burnt down as there were no
mean of turn it up the smaller hand lamp howev which were also
made of bake clai were fit with wick manufactur from the pith
of a palmtre or sometim from the stem of a veri handsom varieti
of fern thi kind of wick wa pass through a round hole at the end of
the lamp to which a sharp piec of hard wood wa attach wherewith to
pierc and draw it up whenev it show sign of burn low
for a while we sat down and watch thi grim peopl eat their
even meal in silenc as grim as themselv till at length get
tire of contempl them and the huge move shadow on the rocki
wall i suggest to our new keeper that we should like to go to bed
without a word he rose and take me polit by the hand advanc
with a lamp to on of the small passag that i had notic open
out of the central cave thi we follow for about five pace when it
suddenli widen out into a small chamber about eight feet squar and
hewn out of the live rock on on side of thi chamber wa a stone
slab about three feet from the ground and run it entir length
like a bunk in a cabin and on thi slab he intim that i wa to
sleep there wa no window or airhol to the chamber and no furnitur
and on look at it more close i came to the disturb conclus
in which as i afterward discov i wa quit right that it
had origin serv for a sepulchr for the dead rather than a
sleepingplac for the live the slab be design to receiv the
corps of the depart the thought made me shudder in spite of myself
but see that i must sleep somewher i got over the feel as best
i might and return to the cavern to get my blanket which had been
brought up from the boat with the other thing there i met job who
have been induct to a similar apart had flatli declin to stop
in it sai that the look of the place gave him the horror and that
he might as well be dead and buri in hi grandfath brick grave
at onc and express hi determin of sleep with me if i would
allow him thi of cours i wa onli too glad to do
the night pass veri comfort on the whole i sai on the whole
for person i went through a most horribl nightmar of be buri
aliv induc no doubt by the sepulchr natur of my surround
at dawn we were arous by a loud trumpet sound produc as we
afterward discov by a young amahagg blow through a hole
bore in it side into a hollow eleph tusk which wa kept for the
purpos
take the hint we got up and went down to the stream to wash after
which the morn meal wa serv at breakfast on of the women no
longer quit young advanc and publicli kiss job i think it wa in
it wai the most delight thing put it improprieti asid for
a moment that i ever saw never shall i forget the respect job
abject terror and disgust job like myself is a bit of a misogynisti
fanci chiefli ow to the fact of hi have been on of a famili
of seventeenand the feel express upon hi counten when
he realis that he wa not onli be embrac publicli and without
authoris on hi own part but also in the presenc of hi master
were too mix and pain to admit of accur descript he sprang
to hi feet and push the woman a buxom person of about thirti from
him
well i never he gasp whereupon probabl think that he wa onli
coi she embrac him again
be off with you get awai you minx he shout wave the wooden
spoon with which he wa eat hi breakfast up and down befor the
ladi face beg your pardon gentlemen i am sure i havent encourag
her oh lord she come for me again hold her mr holli pleas
hold her i cant stand it i cant inde thi ha never happen to
me befor gentlemen never there noth against my charact and
here he broke off and ran as hard as he could go down the cave and for
onc i saw the amahagg laugh as for the woman howev she did
not laugh on the contrari she seem to bristl with furi which the
mockeri of the other women about onli serv to intensifi she stood
there liter snarl and shake with indign and see her
i wish job scrupl had been at jericho form a shrewd guess that
hi admir behaviour had endang our throat nor as the sequel
show wa i wrong
the ladi have retreat job return in a great state of nervous
and keep hi weather ey fix upon everi woman who came near him i
took an opportun to explain to our host that job wa a marri man
and had had veri unhappi experi in hi domest relat which
account for hi presenc here and hi terror at the sight of women
but my remark were receiv in grim silenc it be evid that our
retain behaviour wa consid as a slight to the household
at larg although the women after the manner of some of their most
civilis sister made merri at the rebuff of their companion
after breakfast we took a walk and inspect the amahagg herd and
also their cultiv land thei have two breed of cattl on larg
and angular with no horn but yield beauti milk and the other
a red breed veri small and fat excel for meat but of no valu for
milk purpos thi last breed close resembl the norfolk redpol
strain onli it ha horn which gener curv forward over the head
sometim to such an extent that thei have to be cut to prevent them
from grow into the bone of the skull the goat ar longhair and
ar us for eat onli at least i never saw them milk as for the
amahagg cultiv it is primit in the extrem be all done
by mean of a spade made of iron for these peopl smelt and work iron
thi spade is shape more like a big spearhead than anyth els and
ha no shoulder to it on which the foot can be set as a consequ
the labour of dig is veri great it is howev all done by the
men the women contrari to the habit of most savag race be
entir exempt from manual toil but then as i think i have said
elsewher among the amahagg the weaker sex ha establish it
right
at first we were much puzzl as to the origin and constitut of
thi extraordinari race point upon which thei were singularli
uncommun as the time went onfor the next four dai pass
without ani strike eventw learnt someth from leo ladi friend
ustan who by the wai stuck to that young gentleman like hi own
shadow as to origin thei had none at least so far as she wa
awar there were howev she inform us mound of masonri and mani
pillar near the place where she live which wa call kr and
which the wise said had onc been hous wherein men live and it wa
suggest that thei were descend from these men no on howev
dare go near these great ruin becaus thei were haunt thei onli
look on them from a distanc other similar ruin were to be seen she
had heard in variou part of the countri that is wherev on of
the mountain rose abov the level of the swamp also the cave in which
thei live had been hollow out of the rock by men perhap the same
who built the citi thei themselv had no written law onli custom
which wa howev quit as bind as law if ani man offend
against the custom he wa put to death by order of the father of the
household i ask how he wa put to death and she onli smile and
said that i might see on dai soon
thei had a queen howev she wa their queen but she wa veri
rare seen perhap onc in two or three year when she came forth to
pass sentenc on some offend and when seen wa muffl up in a big
cloak so that nobodi could look upon her face those who wait upon
her were deaf and dumb and therefor could tell no tale but it wa
report that she wa love as no other woman wa love or ever had
been it wa rumour also that she wa immort and had power over
all thing but she ustan could sai noth of all that what she
believ wa that the queen chose a husband from time to time and as
soon as a femal child wa born thi husband who wa never again seen
wa put to death then the femal child grew up and took the place of
the queen when it mother di and had been buri in the great cave
but of these matter none could speak with certainti onli she wa
obei throughout the length and breadth of the land and to question
her command wa instant death she kept a guard but had no regular
armi and to disobei her wa to die
i ask what size the land wa and how mani peopl live in it she
answer that there were ten household like thi that she knew
of includ the big household where the queen wa that all the
household live in cave in place resembl thi stretch of rais
countri dot about in a vast extent of swamp which wa onli to be
thread by secret path often the household made war on each other
until she sent word that it wa to stop and then thei instantli
ceas that and the fever which thei caught in cross the swamp
prevent their number from increas too much thei had no connect
with ani other race inde none live near them or were abl to thread
the vast swamp onc an armi from the direct of the great river
presum the zambesi had attempt to attack them but thei got lost
in the marsh and at night see the great ball of fire that move
about there tri to come to them think that thei mark the enemi
camp and half of them were drown as for the rest thei soon di of
fever and starvat not a blow be struck at them the marsh she
told us were absolut impass except to those who knew the path
ad what i could well believ that we should never have reach
thi place where we then were had we not been brought thither
these and mani other thing we learnt from ustan dure the four dai
paus befor our real adventur began and as mai be imagin thei
gave us consider caus for thought the whole thing wa exceedingli
remark almost incred so inde and the oddest part of it wa
that so far it did more or less correspond to the ancient write on the
sherd and now it appear that there wa a mysteri queen cloth by
rumour with dread and wonder attribut and commonli known by the
imperson but to my mind rather awesom titl of she altogeth
i could not make it out nor could leo though of cours he wa
exceedingli triumphant over me becaus i had persist mock at the
whole thing as for job he had long sinc abandon ani attempt to call
hi reason hi own and left it to drift upon the sea of circumst
mahom the arab who wa by the wai treat civilli inde but
with chill contempt by the amahagg wa i discov in a great
fright though i could not quit make out what he wa frighten about
he would sit crouch up in a corner of the cave all dai long call
upon allah and the prophet to protect him when i press him about it
he said that he wa afraid becaus these peopl were not men or women at
all but devil and that thi wa an enchant land and upon my word
onc or twice sinc then i have been inclin to agre with him and
so the time went on till the night of the fourth dai after billali had
left when someth happen
we three and ustan were sit round a fire in the cave just befor
bedtim when suddenli the woman who had been brood in silenc
rose and laid her hand upon leo golden curl and address him even
now when i shut my ey i can see her proud imperi form cloth
altern in dens shadow and the red flicker of the fire as she
stood the wild centr of as weird a scene as i ever wit and
deliv herself of the burden of her thought and forebod in a
kind of rhythmic speech that ran someth as follow
thou art my choseni have wait for thee from the begin
thou art veri beauti who hath hair like unto thee or skin so
white
who hath so strong an arm who is so much a man
thine ey ar the sky and the light in them is the star
thou art perfect and of a happi face and my heart turn itself
toward thee
ay when mine ey fell upon thee i did desir thee
then did i take thee to meoh thou belov
and hold thee fast lest harm should come unto thee
ay i did cover thine head with mine hair lest the sun should
strike it
and altogeth wa i thine and thou wast altogeth mine
and so it went for a littl space till time wa in labour with
an evil dai
and then what befel on that dai ala my belov i know not
but i i saw thee no morei i wa lost in the black
and she who is stronger did take thee ay she who is fairer than
ustan
yet didst thou turn and call upon me and let thine ey wander in
the dark
but nevertheless she prevail by beauti and led thee down
horribl place
and then ah then my belov
here thi extraordinari woman broke off her speech or chant which wa
so much music gibberish to us for all that we understood of what she
wa talk about and seem to fix her flash ey upon the deep
shadow befor her then in a moment thei acquir a vacant terrifi
stare as though thei were strive to realis some halfseen horror
she lift her hand from leo head and point into the dark we
all look and could see noth but she saw someth or thought she
did and someth evid that affect even her iron nerv for
without anoth sound down she fell senseless between us
leo who wa grow realli attach to thi remark young person
wa in a great state of alarm and distress and i to be perfectli
candid wa in a condit not far remov from superstiti fear the
whole scene wa an uncanni on
present howev she recov and sat up with an extraordinari
convuls shudder
what didst thou mean ustan ask leo who thank to year of
tuition spoke arab veri prettili
nai my chosen she answer with a littl forc laugh i did but
sing unto thee after the fashion of my peopl sure i meant noth
how could i speak of that which is not yet
and what didst thou see ustan i ask look her sharpli in the
face
nai she answer again i saw naught ask me not what i saw why
should i fright ye and then turn to leo with a look of the most
utter tender that i ever saw upon the face of a woman civilis
or savag she took hi head between her hand and kiss him on the
forehead as a mother might
when i am gone from thee my chosen she said when at night thou
stretchest out thine hand and canst not find me then shouldst thou
think at time of me for of a truth i love thee well though i be not
fit to wash thy feet and now let us love and take that which is given
us and be happi for in the grave there is no love and no warmth nor
ani touch of the lip noth perchanc or perchanc but bitter
memori of what might have been tonight the hour ar our own how
know we to whom thei shall belong tomorrow
viii
the feast and after
on the dai follow thi remark scenea scene calcul to make
a deep impress upon anybodi who beheld it more becaus of what it
suggest and seem to foreshadow than of what it revealedit wa
announc to us that a feast would be held that even in our honour
i did my best to get out of it sai that we were modest peopl and
care littl for feast but my remark be receiv with the silenc
of displeasur i thought it wisest to hold my tongu
accordingli just befor sundown i wa inform that everyth wa
readi and accompani by job went into the cave where i met leo
who wa as usual follow by ustan these two had been out walk
somewher and knew noth of the project festiv till that moment
when ustan heard of it i saw an express of horror spring up upon her
handsom featur turn she caught a man who wa pass up the cave
by the arm and ask him someth in an imperi tone hi answer
seem to reassur her a littl for she look reliev though far
from satisfi next she appear to attempt some remonstr with the
man who wa a person in author but he spoke angrili to her and
shook her off and then chang hi mind led her by the arm and sat
her down between himself and anoth man in the circl round the fire
and i perceiv that for some reason of her own she thought it best to
submit
the fire in the cave wa an unusu big on that night and in a
larg circl round it were gather about thirtyf men and two women
ustan and the woman to avoid whom job had plai the rle of anoth
scriptur charact the men were sit in perfect silenc as wa
their custom each with hi great spear stuck upright behind him in
a socket cut in the rock for that purpos onli on or two wore the
yellowish linen garment of which i have spoken the rest had noth on
except the leopard skin about the middl
what up now sir said job doubtfulli bless us and save us
there that woman again now sure she cant be after me see
that i have given her no encourag thei give me the creep the
whole lot of them and that a fact why look thei have ask mahom
to dine too there that ladi of mine is talk to him in as nice and
civil a wai as possibl well im glad it isnt me that all
we look up and sure enough the woman in question had risen and wa
escort the wretch mahom from hi corner where overcom by some
acut prescienc of horror he had been seat shiver and call
on allah he appear unwil enough to come if for no other reason
perhap becaus it wa an unaccustom honour for hitherto hi food had
been given to him apart anywai i could see that he wa in a state of
great terror for hi totter leg would scarc support hi
stout bulki form and i think it wa rather ow to the resourc
of barbar behind him in the shape of a huge amahagg with a
proportion huge spear than to the seduct of the ladi who led
him by the hand that he consent to come at all
well i said to the other i dont at all like the look of thing
but i suppos we must face it out have you fellow got your revolv
on becaus if so you had better see that thei ar load
i have sir said job tap hi colt but mr leo ha onli got hi
hunt knife though that is big enough sure
feel that it would not do to wait while the miss weapon wa
fetch we advanc boldli and seat ourselv in a line with our
back against the side of the cave
as soon as we were seat an earthenwar jar wa pass round
contain a ferment fluid of by no mean unpleas tast though
apt to turn upon the stomach made from crush grainnot indian corn
but a small brown grain that grow upon it stem in cluster not unlik
that which in the southern part of africa is known by the name of kafir
corn the vase which contain thi liquor wa veri curiou and as
it more or less resembl mani hundr of other in us among the
amahagg i mai as well describ it these vase ar of a veri ancient
manufactur and of all size none such can have been made in the
countri for hundr or rather thousand of year thei ar found
in the rock tomb of which i shall give a descript in their proper
place and my own belief is that after the fashion of the egyptian
with whom the former inhabit of thi countri mai have had some
connect thei were us to receiv the viscera of the dead leo
howev is of opinion that as in the case of etruscan amphor thei
were place there for the spiritu us of the deceas thei ar mostli
twohandl and of all size some be nearli three feet in height
and run from that down to as mani inch in shape thei vari but
all ar exceedingli beauti and grace be made of a veri fine
black ware not lustrou but slightli rough on thi groundwork ar
inlaid figur much more grace and lifelik than ani other that
i have seen on antiqu vase some of these inlaid pictur repres
lovescen with a childlik simplic and freedom of manner which
would not commend itself to the tast of the present dai other again
give pictur of maiden danc and yet other of huntingscen for
instanc the veri vase from which we were then drink had on on side
a most spirit draw of men appar white in colour attack a
bulleleph with spear while on the revers wa a pictur not quit
so well done of a hunter shoot an arrow at a run antelop i
should sai from the look of it either an eland or a koodoo
thi is a digress at a critic moment but it is not too long for
the occas for the occas itself wa veri long with the except
of the period pass of the vase and the movement necessari to
throw fuel on to the fire noth happen for the best part of a whole
hour nobodi spoke a word there we all sat in perfect silenc stare
at the glare and glow of the larg fire and at the shadow thrown by
the flicker earthenwar lamp which by the wai were not ancient
on the open space between us and the fire lai a larg wooden trai
with four short handl to it exactli like a butcher trai onli not
hollow out by the side of the trai wa a great pair of longhandl
iron pincer and on the other side of the fire wa a similar pair
somehow i did not at all like the appear of thi trai and the
accompani pincer there i sat and stare at them and at the silent
circl of the fierc moodi face of the men and reflect that it
wa all veri aw and that we were absolut in the power of thi
alarm peopl who to me at ani rate were all the more formid
becaus their true charact wa still veri much of a mysteri to us
thei might be better than i thought them or thei might be wors i
fear that thei were wors and i wa not wrong it wa a curiou sort
of a feast i reflect in appear inde an entertain of the
barmecid stamp for there wa absolut noth to eat
at last just as i wa begin to feel as though i were be
mesmeris a move wa made without the slightest warn a man from
the other side of the circl call out in a loud voic
where is the flesh that we shall eat
thereon everybodi in the circl answer in a deep measur tone and
stretch out the right arm toward the fire as he spoke
the flesh will come
is it a goat said the same man
it is a goat without horn and more than a goat and we shall slai
it thei answer with on voic and turn half round thei on and
all grasp the handl of their spear with the right hand and then
simultan let them go
is it an ox said the man again
it is an ox without horn and more than an ox and we shall slai
it wa the answer and again the spear were grasp and again let
go
then came a paus and i notic with horror and a rise of the hair
that the woman next to mahom began to fondl him pat hi cheek
and call him by name of endear while her fierc ey plai up
and down hi trembl form i do not know why the sight frighten me
so but it did frighten us all dreadfulli especi leo the caress
wa so snakelik and so evid a part of some ghastli formula that
had to be gone through i saw mahom turn white under hi brown
skin sickli white with fear
we afterward learnt that it object wa to pretend to
the victim that he wa the object of love and admir
and so to sooth hi injur feel and caus him to
expir in a happi and content frame of mindl h h
is the meat readi to be cook ask the voic more rapidli
it is readi it is readi
is the pot hot to cook it it continu in a sort of scream that
echo painfulli down the great recess of the cave
it is hot it is hot
great heaven roar leo rememb the write the peopl who
place pot upon the head of stranger
as he said the word befor we could stir or even take the matter in
two great ruffian jump up and seiz the long pincer thrust them
into the heart of the fire and the woman who had been caress mahom
suddenli produc a fibr noos from under her girdl or moocha and
slip it over hi shoulder ran it tight while the men next to him
seiz him by the leg the two men with the pincer gave a heav and
scatter the fire thi wai and that upon the rocki floor lift
from it a larg earthenwar pot heat to a white heat in an instant
almost with a singl movement thei had reach the spot where mahom
wa struggl he fought like a fiend shriek in the abandon of
hi despair and notwithstand the noos round him and the effort
of the men who held hi leg the advanc wretch were for the moment
unabl to accomplish their purpos which horribl and incred as it
seem wa to put the redhot pot upon hi head
i sprang to my feet with a yell of horror and draw my revolv fire
it by a sort of instinct straight at the diabol woman who had been
caress mahom and wa now grip him in her arm the bullet
struck her in the back and kill her and to thi dai i am glad that
it did for as it afterward transpir she had avail herself of the
anthropophag custom of the amahagg to organis the whole thing in
reveng of the slight put upon her by job she sank down dead and as
she did so to my terror and dismai mahom by a superhuman effort
burst from hi torment and spring high into the air fell dy
upon her corps the heavi bullet from my pistol had driven through
the bodi of both at onc strike down the murderess and save her
victim from a death a hundr time more horribl it wa an aw and
yet a most merci accid
for a moment there wa a silenc of astonish the amahagg had
never heard the report of a firearm befor and it effect dismai
them but the next a man close to us recov himself and seiz hi
spear preparatori to make a lung with it at leo who wa the nearest
to him
run for it i shout set the exampl by start up the cave as
hard as my leg would carri me i would have made for the open air if
it had been possibl but there were men in the wai and besid i
had caught sight of the form of a crowd of peopl stand out clear
against the skylin beyond the entranc to the cave up the cave i went
and after me came the other and after them thunder the whole crowd
of cannib mad with furi at the death of the woman with a bound i
clear the prostrat form of mahom as i flew over him i felt the
heat from the redhot pot which wa ly close by strike upon my
leg and by it glow saw hi handsfor he wa not quit deadstil
feebli move at the top of the cave wa a littl platform of rock
three feet or so high by about eight deep on which two larg lamp were
place at night whether thi platform had been left as a seat or as a
rais point afterward to be cut awai when it had serv it purpos
as a stand place from which to carri on the excav i do not
knowat least i did not then at ani rate we all three reach it
and jump on it prepar to sell our live as dearli as we could
for a few second the crowd that wa press on our heel hung back
when thei saw us face round upon them job wa on on side of the rock
to the left leo in the centr and i to the right behind us were
the lamp leo bent forward and look down the long lane of shadow
termin in the fire and light lamp through which the quiet
form of our wouldb murder flit to and fro with the faint light
glint on their spear for even their furi wa silent as a bulldog
the onli other thing visibl wa the redhot pot still glow angrili
in the gloom there wa a curiou light in leo ey and hi
handsom face wa set like a stone in hi right hand wa hi heavi
huntingknif he shift it thong a littl up hi wrist and then put
hi arm round me and gave me a good hug
goodby old fellow he said my dear friendmi more than father
we have no chanc against those scoundrel thei will finish us in a
few minut and eat us afterward i suppos goodby i led you into
thi i hope you will forgiv me goodby job
god will be done i said set my teeth as i prepar for the
end at that moment with an exclam job lift hi revolv and
fire and hit a mannot the man he had aim at by the wai anyth
that job shot at wa perfectli safe
on thei came with a rush and i fire too as fast as i could and
check thembetween us job and i besid the woman kill or
mortal wound five men with our pistol befor thei were empti
but we had no time to reload and thei still came on in a wai that wa
almost splendid in it reckless see that thei did not know but
that we could go on fire for ever
a great fellow bound up upon the platform and leo struck him dead
with on blow of hi power arm send the knife right through him
i did the same by anoth but job miss hi stroke and i saw a brawni
amahagg grip him by the middl and whirl him off the rock the knife
not be secur by a thong fell from job hand as he did so and by
a most happi accid for him lit upon it handl on the rock just as
the bodi of the amahagg who wa undermost struck upon it point and
wa transfix upon it what happen to job after that i am sure i do
not know but my own impress is that he lai still upon the corps of
hi deceas assail plai possum as the american sai as for
myself i wa soon involv in a desper encount with two ruffian
who luckili for me had left their spear behind them and for the
first time in my life the great physic power with which natur ha
endow me stood me in good stead i had hack at the head of on man
with my huntingknif which wa almost as big and heavi as a short
sword with such vigour that the sharp steel had split hi skull
down to the ey and wa held so fast by it that as he suddenli fell
sidewai the knife wa twist right out of my hand
then it wa that the two other sprang upon me i saw them come and
got an arm round the waist of each and down we all fell upon the floor
of the cave togeth roll over and over thei were strong men but
i wa mad with rage and that aw lust for slaughter which will creep
into the heart of the most civilis of us when blow ar fly and
life and death trembl on the turn my arm were round the two swarthi
demon and i hug them till i heard their rib crack and crunch up
beneath my grip thei twist and writh like snake and claw and
batter at me with their fist but i held on ly on my back there
so that their bodi might protect me from spear thrust from abov i
slowli crush the life out of them and as i did so strang as it mai
seem i thought of what the amiabl head of my colleg at cambridg who
is a member of the peac societi and my brother fellow would sai if by
clairvoy thei could see me of all men plai such a bloodi game
soon my assail grew faint and almost ceas to struggl their
breath had fail them and thei were dy but still i dare not leav
them for thei di veri slowli i knew that if i relax my grip thei
would reviv the other ruffian probabl thoughtfor we were all three
ly in the shadow of the ledgethat we were all dead togeth at ani
rate thei did not interfer with our littl tragedi
i turn my head and as i lai gasp in the throe of that aw
struggl i could see that leo wa off the rock now for the lamplight
fell full upon him he wa still on hi feet but in the centr of a
surg mass of struggl men who were strive to pull him down as
wolv pull down a stag up abov them tower hi beauti pale face
crown with it bright curl for leo is six feet two high and i saw
that he wa fight with a desper abandon and energi that wa
at onc splendid and hideou to behold he drove hi knife through on
manthei were so close to and mix up with him that thei could not
get at him to kill him with their big spear and thei had no knive or
stick the man fell and then somehow the knife wa wrench from hi
hand leav him defenceless and i thought the end had come but no
with a desper effort he broke loos from them seiz the bodi of the
man he had just slain and lift it high in the air hurl it right at
the mob of hi assail so that the shock and weight of it swept
some five or six of them to the earth but in a minut thei were all up
again except on whose skull wa smash and had onc more fasten
upon him and then slowli and with infinit labour and struggl
the wolv bore the lion down onc even then he recov himself and
fell an amahagg with hi fist but it wa more than man could do to
hold hi own for long against so mani and at last he came crash down
upon the rock floor fall as an oak fall and bear with him to
the earth all those who clung about him thei grip him by hi arm
and leg and then clear off hi bodi
a spear cri a voicea spear to cut hi throat and a vessel to
catch hi blood
i shut my ey for i saw the man come with a spear and myself i
could not stir to leo help for i wa grow weak and the two men on
me were not yet dead and a deadli sick overcam me
then suddenli there wa a disturb and involuntarili i open my
ey again and look toward the scene of murder the girl ustan had
thrown herself on leo prostrat form cover hi bodi with her bodi
and fasten her arm about hi neck thei tri to drag her from
him but she twist her leg round hi and hung on like a bulldog or
rather like a creeper to a tree and thei could not then thei tri to
stab him in the side without hurt her but somehow she shield him
and he wa onli wound
at last thei lost patienc
drive the spear through the man and the woman togeth said a voic
the same voic that had ask the question at that ghastli feast so
of a veriti shall thei be wed
then i saw the man with the weapon straighten himself for the effort i
saw the cold steel gleam on high and onc more i shut my ey
as i did so i heard the voic of a man thunder out in tone that rang
and echo down the rocki wai
ceas
then i faint and as i did so it flash through my darken mind
that i wa pass down into the last oblivion of death
ix
a littl foot
when i open my ey again i found myself ly on a skin mat not far
from the fire round which we had been gather for that dread feast
near me lai leo still appar in a swoon and over him wa bend
the tall form of the girl ustan who wa wash a deep spear wound
in hi side with cold water preparatori to bind it up with linen
lean against the wall of the cave behind her wa job appar
uninjur but bruis and trembl on the other side of the fire
toss about thi wai and that as though thei had thrown themselv
down to sleep in some moment of absolut exhaust were the bodi of
those whom we had kill in our fright struggl for life i count
them there were twelv besid the woman and the corps of poor
mahom who had di by my hand which the firestain pot at it
side wa place at the end of the irregular line to the left a bodi of
men were engag in bind the arm of the survivor of the cannib
behind them and then fasten them two and two the villain were
submit with a look of sulki indiffer upon their face which
accord ill with the baffl furi that gleam in their sombr ey
in front of these men direct the oper stood no other than our
friend billali look rather tire but particularli patriarch
with hi flow beard and as cool and unconcern as though he were
superintend the cut up of an ox
present he turn and perceiv that i wa sit up advanc
to me and with the utmost courtesi said that he trust that i felt
better i answer that at present i scarc knew how i felt except
that i ach all over
then he bent down and examin leo wound
it is an evil cut he said but the spear ha not pierc the
entrail he will recov
thank to thy arriv my father i answer in anoth minut we
should all have been beyond the reach of recoveri for those devil of
thine would have slain us as thei would have slain our servant and i
point toward mahom
the old man ground hi teeth and i saw an extraordinari express of
malign light up hi ey
fear not my son he answer vengeanc shall be taken on them such
as would make the flesh twist upon the bone mere to hear of it to
she shall thei go and her vengeanc shall be worthi of her great
that man point to mahom i tell thee that man would have di a
merci death to the death these hynamen shall die tell me i prai
of thee how it came about
in a few word i sketch what had happen
ah so he answer thou seest my son here there is a custom that
if a stranger come into thi countri he mai be slain by the pot and
eaten
it is hospit turn upsid down i answer feebli in our
countri we entertain a stranger and give him food to eat here ye eat
him and ar entertain
it is a custom he answer with a shrug myself i think it an evil
on but then he ad by an afterthought i do not like the tast
of stranger especi after thei have wander through the swamp and
live on wildfowl when shewhomustbeobei sent order that ye
were to be save aliv she said naught of the black man therefor
be hyna these men lust after hi flesh and the woman it wa
whom thou didst rightli slai who put it into their evil heart to
hotpot him well thei will have their reward better for them would it
be if thei had never seen the light than that thei should stand befor
she in her terribl anger happi ar those of them who di by your
hand
ah he went on it wa a gallant fight that ye fought knowest thou
that longarm old baboon that thou art thou hast crush in the rib
of those two who ar laid out there as though thei were but as the shell
on an egg and the young on the lion it wa a beauti stand that
he madeon against so manythre did he slai outright and that on
thereand he point to a bodi that wa still move a littlewil
die anon for hi head is crack across and other of those who ar
bound ar hurt it wa a gallant fight and thou and he have made a
friend of me by it for i love to see a wellfought frai but tell me
my son the baboonand now i think of it thy face too is hairi and
altogeth like a baboonshow wa it that ye slew those with a hole in
themy made a nois thei sai and slew themthei fell down on the
face at the nois
i explain to him as well as i could but veri shortlyfor i wa
terribl weari and onli persuad to talk at all through fear
of offend on so power if i refus to do sowhat were the
properti of gunpowd and he instantli suggest that i should
illustr what i said by oper on the person of on of the
prison on he said never would be count and it would not onli
be veri interest to him but would give me the opportun of an
instal of reveng he wa greatli astound when i told him that it
wa not our custom to aveng ourselv in cold blood and that we left
vengeanc to the law and a higher power of which he knew noth i
ad howev that when i recov i would take him out shoot
with us and he should kill an anim for himself and at thi he wa as
pleas as a child at the promis of a new toi
just then leo open hi ey beneath the stimulu of some brandi of
which we still had a littl that job had pour down hi throat and
our convers came to an end
after thi we manag to get leo who wa in a veri poor wai inde and
onli half consciou safe off to bed support by job and that brave
girl ustan to whom had i not been afraid that she might resent it i
would certainli have given a kiss for her splendid behaviour in save
my boi life at the risk of her own but ustan wa not the sort of
young person with whom on would care to take liberti unless on were
perfectli certain that thei would not be misunderstood so i repress
my inclin then bruis and batter but with a sens of safeti
in my breast to which i had for some dai been a stranger i crept off
to my own littl sepulchr not forget befor i laid down in it to
thank provid from the bottom of my heart that it wa not a sepulchr
inde as save for a merci combin of event that i can onli
attribut to it protect it would certainli have been for me that
night few men have been nearer their end and yet escap it than we
were on that dread dai
i am a bad sleeper at the best of time and my dream that night when
at last i got to rest were not of the pleasantest the aw vision of
poor mahom struggl to escap the redhot pot would haunt them and
then in the background as it were a veil form wa alwai hover
which from time to time seem to draw the cover from it bodi
reveal now the perfect shape of a love bloom woman and now
again the white bone of a grin skeleton and which as it veil
and unveil utter the mysteri and appar meaningless
sentenc
that which is aliv and hath known death and that which is dead yet
can never die for in the circl of the spirit life is naught and death
is naught yea all thing live for ever though at time thei sleep and
ar forgotten
the morn came at last but when it came i found that i wa too stiff
and sore to rise about seven job arriv limp terribl and with
hi face the colour of a rotten appl and told me that leo had slept
fairli but wa veri weak two hour afterward billali job call
him billygoat to which inde hi white beard gave him some
resembl or more familiarli billi came too bear a lamp in
hi hand hi tower form reach nearli to the roof of the littl
chamber i pretend to be asleep and through the crack of my eyelid
watch hi sardon but handsom old face he fix hi hawklik ey
upon me and stroke hi gloriou white beard which by the wai
would have been worthi a hundr a year to ani london barber as an
advertis
ah i heard him mutter billali had a habit of mutter to himself
he is uglyugli as the other is beautifula veri baboon it wa a
good name but i like the man strang now at my ag that i should
like a man what sai the proverbmistrust all men and slai him whom
thou mistrustest overmuch and as for women flee from them for thei
ar evil and in the end will destroi thee it is a good proverb
especi the last part of it i think that it must have come down from
the ancient nevertheless i like thi baboon and i wonder where thei
taught him hi trick and i trust that she will not bewitch him poor
baboon he must be weari after that fight i will go lest i should
awak him
i wait till he had turn and wa nearli through the entranc walk
softli on tipto and then i call after him
my father i said is it thou
ye my son it is i but let me not disturb thee i did but come to
see how thou didst fare and to tell thee that those who would have
slain thee my baboon ar by now far on their road to she she said
that ye also were to come at onc but i fear ye cannot yet
nai i said not till we have recov a littl but have me born
out into the daylight i prai thee my father i love not thi place
ah no he answer it hath a sad air i rememb when i wa a boi i
found the bodi of a fair woman ly where thou liest now ye on that
veri bench she wa so beauti that i wa wont to creep in hither with
a lamp and gaze upon her had it not been for her cold hand almost
could i think that she slept and would on dai awak so fair and
peac wa she in her robe of white white wa she too and her
hair wa yellow and lai down her almost to the feet there ar mani such
still in the tomb at the place where she is for those who set them
there had a wai i know naught of wherebi to keep their belov out of
the crumbl hand of decai even when death had slain them ay dai
by dai i came hither and gaze on her till at lastlaugh not at me
stranger for i wa but a silli ladi learn to love that dead form
that shell which onc had held a life that no more is i would creep
up to her and kiss her cold face and wonder how mani men had live and
di sinc she wa and who had love her and embrac her in the dai
that long had pass awai and my baboon i think i learn wisdom from
that dead on for of a truth it taught me of the littl of life
and the length of death and how all thing that ar under the sun go
down on path and ar for ever forgotten and so i muse and it seem
to me that wisdom flow into me from the dead till on dai my mother
a watch woman but hastymind see i wa chang follow me
and saw the beauti white on and fear that i wa bewitch as
inde i wa so half in dread and half in anger she took up the
lamp and stand the dead woman up against the wall even there set
fire to her hair and she burnt fierc even down to the feet for
those who ar thu kept burn excel well
see my son there on the roof is yet the smoke of her burn
i look up doubtfulli and there sure enough on the roof of the
sepulchr wa a peculiarli unctuou and sooti mark three feet or more
across doubtless it had in the cours of year been rub off the
side of the littl cave but on the roof it remain and there wa no
mistak it appear
she burnt he went on in a medit wai even to the feet but the
feet i came back and save cut the burnt bone from them and
hid them under the stone bench there wrap up in a piec of linen
sure i rememb it as though it were but yesterdai perchanc thei
ar there if none have found them even to thi hour of a truth i have
not enter thi chamber from that time to thi veri dai stai i will
look and kneel down he grope about with hi long arm in the
recess under the stone bench present hi face brighten and with an
exclam he pull someth forth which wa cake in dust which he
shook on to the floor it wa cover with the remain of a rot rag
which he undid and reveal to my astonish gaze a beautifulli shape
and almost white woman foot look as fresh and firm as though it
had but now been place there
thou seest my son the baboon he said in a sad voic i spake the
truth to thee for here is yet on foot remain take it my son and
gaze upon it
i took thi cold fragment of mortal in my hand and look at it in
the light of the lamp with feel which i cannot describ so mix
up were thei between astonish fear and fascin it wa light
much lighter i should sai than it had been in the live state and the
flesh to all appear wa still flesh though about it there clung a
faintli aromat odour for the rest it wa not shrunk or shrivel or
even black and unsightli like the flesh of egyptian mummi but plump
and fair and except where it had been slightli burnt perfect as on
the dai of deatha veri triumph of embalm
poor littl foot i set it down upon the stone bench where it had lain
for so mani thousand year and wonder whose wa the beauti that
it had upborn through the pomp and pageantri of a forgotten
civilisationfirst as a merri child then as a blush maid and
lastli as a perfect woman through what hall of life had it soft
step echo and in the end with what courag had it trodden down the
dusti wai of death to whose side had it stolen in the hush of night
when the black slave slept upon the marbl floor and who had listen
for it steal shape littl foot well might it have been set upon
the proud neck of a conqueror bent at last to woman beauti and
well might the lip of nobl and of king have been press upon it
jewel white
i wrap up thi relic of the past in the remnant of the old linen rag
which had evid form a portion of it owner gravecloth for
it wa partial burnt and put it awai in my gladston baga strang
combin i thought then with billali help i stagger off to see
leo i found him dreadfulli bruis wors even than myself perhap
ow to the excess white of hi skin and faint and weak with
the loss of blood from the flesh wound in hi side but for all that
cheer as a cricket and ask for some breakfast job and ustan
got him on to the bottom or rather the sack of a litter which wa
remov from it pole for that purpos and with the aid of old billali
carri him out into the shade at the mouth of the cave from which by
the wai everi trace of the slaughter of the previou night had now been
remov and there we all breakfast and inde spent that dai and
most of the two follow on
on the third morn job and myself were practic recov leo also
wa so much better that i yield to billali often express entreati
and agre to start at onc upon our journei to kr which we were told
wa the name of the place where the mysteri she live though i
still fear for it effect upon leo and especi lest the motion
should caus hi wound which wa scarc skin over to break open
again inde had it not been for billali evid anxieti to get off
which led us to suspect that some difficulti or danger might threaten us
if we did not compli with it i would not have consent to go
x
specul
within an hour of our final decid to start five litter were
brought up to the door of the cave each accompani by four regular
bearer and two spare hand also a band of about fifti arm amahagg
who were to form the escort and carri the baggag three of these
litter of cours were for us and on for billali who i wa
immens reliev to hear wa to be our companion while the fifth i
presum wa for the us of ustan
doe the ladi go with us my father i ask of billali as he stood
superintend thing in gener
he shrug hi shoulder as he answer
if she will in thi countri the women do what thei pleas we worship
them and give them their wai becaus without them the world could not
go on thei ar the sourc of life
ah i said the matter never have struck me quit in that light
befor
we worship them he went on up to a point till at last thei get
unbear which he ad thei do about everi second gener
and then what do you do i ask with curios
then he answer with a faint smile we rise and kill the old
on as an exampl to the young on and to show them that we ar the
strongest my poor wife wa kill in that wai three year ago it wa
veri sad but to tell thee the truth my son life ha been happier
sinc for my ag protect me from the young on
in short i repli quot the sai of a great man whose wisdom
ha not yet lighten the dark of the amahagg thou hast found
thy posit on of greater freedom and less respons
thi phrase puzzl him a littl at first from it vagu though i
think my translat hit off it sens veri well but at last he saw it
and appreci it
ye ye my baboon he said i see it now but all the
respons ar kill at least some of them ar and that is
why there ar so few old women about just now well thei brought it on
themselv as for thi girl he went on in a graver tone i know
not what to sai she is a brave girl and she love the lion leo thou
sawest how she clung to him and save hi life also she is accord
to our custom wed to him and ha a right to go where he goe unless
he ad significantli she would sai her no for her word overrid
all right
and if she bade her leav him and the girl refus what then
if he said with a shrug the hurrican bid the tree to bend and
it will not what happen
and then without wait for an answer he turn and walk to hi
litter and in ten minut from that time we were all well under wai
it took us an hour and more to cross the cup of the volcan plain
and anoth halfhour or so to climb the edg on the farther side onc
there howev the view wa a veri fine on befor us wa a long steep
slope of grassi plain broken here and there by clump of tree mostli
of the thorn tribe at the bottom of thi gentl slope some nine or ten
mile awai we could make out a dim sea of marsh over which the foul
vapour hung like smoke about a citi it wa easi go for the bearer
down the slope and by middai we had reach the border of the dismal
swamp here we halt to eat our middai meal and then follow a
wind and deviou path plung into the morass present the path
at ani rate to our unaccustom ey grew so faint as to be almost
indistinguish from those made by the aquat beast and bird and
it is to thi dai a mysteri to me how our bearer found their wai across
the marsh ahead of the cavalcad march two men with long pole
which thei now and again plung into the ground befor them the reason
of thi be that the natur of the soil frequent chang from caus
with which i am not acquaint so that place which might be safe
enough to cross on month would certainli swallow the wayfar the next
never did i see a more dreari and depress scene mile on mile of
quagmir vari onli by bright green strip of compar solid
ground and by deep and sullen pool fring with tall rush in which
the bittern boom and the frog croak incessantli mile on mile of
it without a break unless the fever fog can be call a break the onli
life in thi great morass wa that of the aquat bird and the anim
that fed on them of both of which there were vast number gees
crane duck teal coot snipe and plover swarm all around us mani
be of varieti that were quit new to me and all so tame that on
could almost have knock them over with a stick among these bird i
especi notic a veri beauti varieti of paint snipe almost the
size of a woodcock and with a flight more resembl that bird than
an english snipe in the pool too wa a speci of small allig
or enorm iguana i do not know which that fed billali told me upon
the waterfowl also larg quantiti of a hideou black watersnak of
which the bite is veri danger though not i gather so deadli as a
cobra or a puff adder the bullfrog were also veri larg and
with voic proportion to their size and as for the mosquitoesth
musquet as job call themthei were if possibl even wors
than thei had been on the river and torment us greatli undoubtedli
howev the worst featur of the swamp wa the aw smell of
rot veget that hung about it which wa at time posit
overpow and the malari exhal that accompani it which
we were of cours oblig to breath
on we went through it all till at last the sun sank in sullen splendour
just as we reach a spot of rise ground about two acr in extenta
littl oasi of dry in the midst of the miri wildernesswher billali
announc that we were to camp the camp howev turn out to be
a veri simpl process and consist in fact in sit down on the
ground round a scanti fire made of dry reed and some wood that had been
brought with us howev we made the best we could of it and smoke
and at with such appetit as the smell of damp stifl heat would
allow for it wa veri hot on thi low land and yet oddli enough
chilli at time but howev hot it wa we were glad enough to keep
near the fire becaus we found that the mosquito did not like the
smoke present we roll ourselv up in our blanket and tri to
go to sleep but so far as i wa concern the bullfrog and the
extraordinari roar and alarm sound produc by hundr of snipe
hover high in the air made sleep an imposs to sai noth of
our other discomfort i turn and look at leo who wa next me he
wa doze but hi face had a flush appear that i did not like
and by the flicker firelight i saw ustan who wa ly on the
other side of him rais herself from time to time upon her elbow and
look at him anxious enough
howev i could do noth for him for we had all alreadi taken a
good dose of quinin which wa the onli prevent we had so i lai and
watch the star come out by thousand till all the immens arch of
heaven wa strewn with glitter point and everi point a world
here wa a gloriou sight by which man might well measur hi own
insignific soon i gave up think about it for the mind weari
easili when it strive to grappl with the infinit and to trace the
footstep of the almighti as he stride from sphere to sphere or
deduc hi purpos from hi work such thing ar not for us to know
knowledg is to the strong and we ar weak too much wisdom would
perchanc blind our imperfect sight and too much strength would make
us drunk and overweight our feebl reason till it fell and we were
drown in the depth of our own vaniti for what is the first result
of man increas knowledg interpret from natur book by the
persist effort of hi purblind observ it is not but too often
to make him question the exist of hi maker or inde of ani
intellig purpos beyond hi own the truth is veil becaus we
could no more look upon her glori than we can upon the sun it would
destroi us full knowledg is not for man as man is here for hi
capac which he is apt to think so great ar inde but small the
vessel is soon fill and were onethousandth part of the unutter
and silent wisdom that direct the roll of those shine sphere and
the forc which make them roll press into it it would be shatter
into fragment perhap in some other place and time it mai be
otherwis who can tell here the lot of man born of the flesh is but
to endur midst toil and tribul to catch at the bubbl blown by
fate which he call pleasur thank if befor thei burst thei rest
a moment in hi hand and when the tragedi is plai out and hi hour
come to perish to pass humbl whither he know not
abov me as i lai shone the etern star and there at my feet the
impish marshborn ball of fire roll thi wai and that vapourtoss
and earthdesir and methought that in the two i saw a type and imag
of what man is and what perchanc man mai on dai be if the live
forc who ordain him and them should so ordain thi also oh that it
might be our to rest year by year upon that high level of the heart to
which at time we momentarili attain oh that we could shake loos the
prison pinion of the soul and soar to that superior point whenc
like to some travel look out through space from darien giddiest
peak we might gaze with spiritu ey deep into infin
what would it be to cast off thi earthi robe to have done for ever
with these earthi thought and miser desir no longer like those
corps candl to be toss thi wai and that by forc beyond our
control or which if we can theoret control them we ar at time
driven by the exig of our natur to obei ye to cast them off
to have done with the foul and thorni place of the world and like to
those glitter point abov me to rest on high wrap for ever in
the bright of our better selv that even now shine in us as fire
faintli shine within those lurid ball and lai down our littl in
that wide glori of our dream that invis but surround good from
which all truth and beauti come
these and mani such thought pass through my mind that night thei
come to torment us all at time i sai to torment for ala think
can onli serv to measur out the helpless of thought what is the
purpos of our feebl cry in the aw silenc of space can our dim
intellig read the secret of that starstrewn sky doe ani answer
come out of it never ani at all noth but echo and fantast
vision and yet we believ that there is an answer and that upon a
time a new dawn will come blush down the wai of our endur night
we believ it for it reflect beauti even now shine up continu
in our heart from beneath the horizon of the grave and we call it
hope without hope we should suffer moral death and by the help of hope
we yet mai climb to heaven or at the worst if she also prove but a
kindli mockeri given to hold us from despair be gentli lower into the
abyss of etern sleep
then i fell to reflect upon the undertak on which we were bent
and what a wild on it wa and yet how strang the stori seem to
fit in with what had been written centuri ago upon the sherd who
wa thi extraordinari woman queen over a peopl appar as
extraordinari as herself and reign amidst the vestig of a lost
civilis and what wa the mean of thi stori of the fire that
gave unend life could it be possibl that ani fluid or essenc
should exist which might so fortifi these fleshi wall that thei
should from ag to ag resist the mine and batter of decai it wa
possibl though not probabl the infinit continu of life would
not as poor vincei said be so marvel a thing as the product of
life and it temporari endur and if it were true what then the
person who found it could no doubt rule the world he could accumul
all the wealth in the world and all the power and all the wisdom that
is power he might give a lifetim to the studi of each art or scienc
well if that were so and thi she were practic immort which
i did not for on moment believ how wa it that with all these thing
at her feet she prefer to remain in a cave amongst a societi
of cannib thi sure settl the question the whole stori wa
monstrou and onli worthi of the superstiti dai in which it wa
written at ani rate i wa veri sure that i would not attempt to
attain unend life i had had far too mani worri and disappoint
and secret bitter dure my forti odd year of exist to wish
that thi state of affair should be continu indefinit and yet i
suppos that my life ha been compar speak a happi on
and then reflect that at the present moment there wa far more
likelihood of our earthli career be cut exceedingli short than of
their be unduli prolong i at last manag to get to sleep a fact
for which anybodi who read thi narr if anybodi ever doe mai
veri probabl be thank
when i woke again it wa just dawn and the guard and bearer were
move about like ghost through the dens morn mist get readi
for our start the fire had di quit down and i rose and stretch
myself shiver in everi limb from the damp cold of the dawn then i
look at leo he wa sit up hold hi hand to hi head and i
saw that hi face wa flush and hi ey bright and yet yellow round
the pupil
well leo i said how do you feel
i feel as though i were go to die he answer hoars my head
is split my bodi is trembl and i am as sick as a cat
i whistl or if i did not whistl i felt inclin toleo had got a
sharp attack of fever i went to job and ask him for the quinin
of which fortun we had still a good suppli onli to find that job
himself wa not much better he complain of pain across the back and
dizzi and wa almost incap of help himself then i did the
onli thing it wa possibl to do under the circumstancesgav them both
about ten grain of quinin and took a slightli smaller dose myself as
a matter of precaut after that i found billali and explain to him
how matter stood ask at the same time what he thought had best be
done he came with me and look at leo and job whom by the wai
he had name the pig on account of hi fat round face and small
ey
ah he said when we were out of earshot the fever i thought so
the lion ha it badli but he is young and he mai live as for the pig
hi attack is not so bad it is the littl fever which he ha that
alwai begin with pain across the back it will spend itself upon hi
fat
can thei go on my father i ask
nai my son thei must go on if thei stop here thei will certainli
die also thei will be better in the litter than on the ground by
tonight if all goe well we shall be across the marsh and in good
air come let us lift them into the litter and start for it is veri
bad to stand still in thi morn fog we can eat our meal as we go
thi we accordingli did and with a heavi heart i onc more set out upon
our strang journei for the first three hour all went as well as
could be expect and then an accid happen that nearli lost us the
pleasur of the compani of our vener friend billali whose litter
wa lead the cavalcad we were go through a particularli
danger stretch of quagmir in which the bearer sometim sank up to
their knee inde it wa a mysteri to me how thei contriv to
carri the heavi litter at all over such ground as that which we were
travers though the two spare hand as well as the four regular
on had of cours to put their shoulder to the pole
present as we blunder and flounder along there wa a sharp
cry then a storm of exclam and last of all a most tremend
splash and the whole caravan halt
i jump out of my litter and ran forward about twenti yard ahead wa
the edg of on of those sullen peati pool of which i have spoken the
path we were follow run along the top of it bank that as it
happen wa a steep on look toward thi pool to my horror i saw
that billali litter wa float on it and as for billali himself he
wa nowher to be seen to make matter clear i mai as well explain
at onc what had happen on of billali bearer had unfortun
trodden on a bask snake which had bitten him in the leg whereon he
had not unnatur let go of the pole and then find that he
wa tumbl down the bank grasp at the litter to save himself the
result of thi wa what might have been expect the litter wa pull
over the edg of the bank the bearer let go and the whole thing
includ billali and the man who had been bitten roll into the slimi
pool when i got to the edg of the water neither of them were to be
seen inde the unfortun bearer never wa seen again either he
struck hi head against someth or get wedg in the mud or possibl
the snakebit paralyz him at ani rate he vanish but though
billali wa not to be seen hi whereabout wa clear enough from the
agit of the float litter in the bear cloth and curtain of
which he wa entangl
he is there our father is there said on of the men but he did not
stir a finger to help him nor did ani of the other thei simpli stood
and stare at the water
out of the wai you brute i shout in english and throw off my
hat i took a run and sprang well out into the horrid slimylook pool
a coupl of stroke took me to where billali wa struggl beneath the
cloth
somehow i do not quit know how i manag to push it free of him
and hi vener head all cover with green slime like that of a
yellowish bacchu with ivi leav emerg upon the surfac of the
water the rest wa easi for billali wa an emin practic
individu and had the common sens not to grasp hold of me as drown
peopl often do so i got him by the arm and tow him to the bank
through the mud out of which we were with difficulti drag such a filthi
spectacl as we present i have never seen befor or sinc and it will
perhap give some idea of the almost superhuman digniti of billali
appear when i sai that cough halfdrown and cover with mud
and green slime as he wa with hi beauti beard come to a drip
point like a chinaman freshlyoil pigtail he still look
vener and impos
ye dog he said address the bearer as soon as he had
suffici recov to speak ye left me your father to drown
had it not been for thi stranger my son the baboon assuredli i should
have drown well i will rememb it and he fix them with hi
gleam though slightli wateri ey in a wai i saw that thei did not
like though thei tri to appear sulkili indiffer
as for thee my son the old man went on turn toward me and
grasp my hand rest assur that i am thy friend through good and
evil thou hast save my life perchanc a dai mai come when i shall
save thine
after that we clean ourselv as best we could fish out the litter
and went on minu the man who had been drown i do not know if
it wa ow to hi be an unpopular charact or from nativ
indiffer and selfish of tempera but i am bound to sai that
nobodi seem to griev much over hi sudden and final disappear
unless perhap it wa the men who had to do hi share of the work
xi
the plain of kr
about an hour befor sundown we at last to my unbound gratitud
emerg from the great belt of marsh on to land that swell upward in
a success of roll wave just on the hither side of the crest
of the first wave we halt for the night my first act wa to examin
leo condit it wa if anyth wors than in the morn and a
new and veri distress featur vomit set in and continu till
dawn not on wink of sleep did i get that night for i pass it in
assist ustan who wa on of the most gentl and indefatig
nurs i ever saw to wait upon leo and job howev the air here wa
warm and genial without be too hot and there were no mosquito
to speak of also we were abov the level of the marsh mist which lai
stretch beneath us like the dim smokepal over a citi lit up here
and there by the wander globe of fen fire thu it will be seen that
we were speak compar in clover
by dawn on the follow morn leo wa quit lighthead and fanci
that he wa divid into halv i wa dreadfulli distress and began
to wonder with a sort of sick fear what the end of the attack would be
ala i had heard but too much of how these attack gener termin
as i wa wonder billali came up and said that we must be get on
more especi as in hi opinion if leo did not reach some spot
where he could be quiet and have proper nurs within the next twelv
hour hi life would onli be a matter of a dai or two i could not but
agre with him so we got leo into the litter and start on ustan
walk by hi side to keep the fli off him and see that he did not
throw himself out on to the ground
within half an hour of sunris we had reach the top of the rise of
which i have spoken and a most beauti view broke upon our gaze
beneath us wa a rich stretch of countri verdant with grass and love
with foliag and flower in the background at a distanc so far as i
could judg of some eighteen mile from where we then stood a huge and
extraordinari mountain rose abruptli from the plain the base of thi
great mountain appear to consist of a grassi slope but rise from
thi i should sai from subsequ observ at a height of about
five hundr feet abov the level of the plain wa a most tremend
and absolut precipit wall of bare rock quit twelv or fifteen
hundr feet in height the shape of the mountain which wa undoubtedli
of volcan origin wa round and of cours as onli a segment of it
circl wa visibl it wa difficult to estim it exact size which
wa enorm i afterward discov that it could cover less than
fifti squar mile of ground anyth more grand and impos than
the sight present by thi great natur castl start in solitari
grandeur from the level of the plain i never saw and i suppos i never
shall it veri solitud ad to it majesti and it tower cliff
seem to kiss the sky inde gener speak thei were cloth in
cloud that lai in fleeci mass upon their broad and level battlement
i sat up in my hammock and gaze out across the plain at thi thrill
and majest sight and i suppos that billali notic it for he
brought hi litter alongsid
behold the hous of shewhomustbeobei he said had ever a
queen such a throne befor
it is wonder my father i answer but how do we enter those
cliff look hard to climb
thou shalt see my baboon look now at the path below us what thinkest
thou that it is thou art a wise man come tell me
i look and saw what appear to be the line of roadwai run
straight toward the base of the mountain though it wa cover with
turf there were high bank on each side of it broken here and there
but fairli continu on the whole the mean of which i did not
understand it seem so veri odd that anybodi should embank a roadwai
well my father i answer i suppos that it is a road otherwis
i should have been inclin to sai that it wa the bed of a river or
rather i ad observ the extraordinari direct of the cut
of a canal
billaliwho by the wai wa none the wors for hi immers of the
dai beforenod hi head sage as he repli
thou art right my son it is a channel cut out by those who were
befor us in thi place to carri awai water of thi i am sure within
the rocki circl of the mountain whither we journei wa onc a great
lake but those who were befor us by wonder art of which i
know naught hew a path for the water through the solid rock of the
mountain pierc even to the bed of the lake but first thei cut the
channel that thou seest across the plain then when at last the water
burst out it rush down the channel that had been made to receiv it
and cross thi plain till it reach the low land behind the rise
and there perchanc it made the swamp through which we have come then
when the lake wa drain dry the peopl whereof i speak built a mighti
citi on it bed whereof naught but ruin and the name of kr yet
remaineth and from ag to ag hew the cave and passag that thou
wilt see
it mai be i answer but if so how is it that the lake doe not
fill up again with the rain and the water of the spring
nai my son the peopl were a wise peopl and thei left a drain to
keep it clear seest thou the river to the right and he point to a
fairsiz stream that wound awai across the plain some four mile from
us that is the drain and it come out through the mountain wall where
thi cut goe in at first perhap the water ran down thi canal
but afterward the peopl turn it and us the cut for a road
and is there then no other place where on mai enter into the great
mountain i ask except through that drain
there is a place he answer where cattl and men on foot mai cross
with much labour but it is secret a year mightest thou search and
shouldst never find it it is onli us onc a year when the herd of
cattl that have been fat on the slope of the mountain and on thi
plain ar driven into the space within
and doe she live there alwai i ask or doe she come at time
without the mountain
nai my son where she is there she is
by now we were well on to the great plain and i wa examin with
delight the vari beauti of it semitrop flower and tree the
latter of which grew singli or at most in clump of three or four much
of the timber be of larg size and belong appar to a varieti
of evergreen oak there were also mani palm some of them more than on
hundr feet high and the largest and most beauti tree fern that
i ever saw about which hung cloud of jewel honeysuck and
greatwing butterfli wander about among the tree or crouch
in the long and feather grass were all varieti of game from
rhinocerot down i saw a rhinocero buffalo a larg herd eland
quagga and sabl antelop the most beauti of all the buck not
to mention mani smaller varieti of game and three ostrich which
scud awai at our approach like white drift befor a gale so
plenti wa the game that at last i could stand it no longer i had
a singl barrel sport martini with me in the litter the express
be too cumbersom and espi a beauti fat eland rub himself
under on of the oaklik tree i jump out of the litter and
proceed to creep as near to him as i could he let me come within
eighti yard and then turn hi head and stare at me preparatori to
run awai i lift the rifl and take him about midwai down the
shoulder for he wa side on to me fire i never made a cleaner shot
or a better kill in all my small experi for the great buck sprang
right up into the air and fell dead the bearer who had all halt to
see the perform gave a murmur of surpris an unwont compliment
from these sullen peopl who never appear to be surpris at anyth
and a parti of the guard at onc ran off to cut the anim up as for
myself though i wa long to have a look at him i saunter back
to my litter as though i had been in the habit of kill eland all my
life feel that i had gone up sever degre in the estim
of the amahagg who look on the whole thing as a veri highclass
manifest of witchcraft as a matter of fact howev i had
never seen an eland in a wild state befor billali receiv me with
enthusiasm
it is wonder my son the baboon he cri wonder thou art
a veri great man though so ugli had i not seen sure i would never
have believ and thou sayest that thou wilt teach me to slai in thi
fashion
certainli my father i said airili it is noth
but all the same i firmli made up my mind that when my father billali
began to fire i would without fail lie down or take refug behind a
tree
after thi littl incid noth happen of ani note till about an
hour and a half befor sundown when we arriv beneath the shadow of
the tower volcan mass that i have alreadi describ it is quit
imposs for me to describ it grim grandeur as it appear to me
while my patient bearer toil along the bed of the ancient watercours
toward the spot where the rich brownhu cliff shot up from precipic
to precipic till it crown lost itself in a cloud all i can sai is
that it almost aw me by the intens of it lonesom and most solemn
great on we went up the bright and sunni slope till at last the
creep shadow from abov swallow up it bright and present
we began to pass through a cut hewn in the live rock deeper
and deeper grew thi marvel work which must i should sai have
emploi thousand of men for mani year inde how it wa ever
execut at all without the aid of blastingpowd or dynamit i cannot
to thi dai imagin it is and must remain on of the mysteri of that
wild land i can onli suppos that these cut and the vast cave
that had been hollow out of the rock thei pierc were the state
undertak of the peopl of kr who live here in the dim lost
ag of the world and as in the case of the egyptian monument were
execut by the forc labour of ten of thousand of captiv carri
on through an indefinit number of centuri but who were the peopl
at last we reach the face of the precipic itself and found ourselv
look into the mouth of a dark tunnel that forcibl remind me of
those undertaken by our nineteenthcenturi engin in the construct
of railwai line out of thi tunnel flow a consider stream of
water inde though i do not think that i have mention it we had
follow thi stream which ultim develop into the river i have
alreadi describ as wind awai to the right from the spot where
the cut in the solid rock commenc half of thi cut form a
channel for the stream and half which wa place on a slightli higher
leveleight feet perhapswa devot to the purpos of a roadwai at
the termin of the cut howev the stream turn off across
the plain and follow a channel of it own at the mouth of the cave
the cavalcad wa halt and while the men emploi themselv in
light some earthenwar lamp thei had brought with them billali
descend from hi litter inform me polit but firmli that the
order of she were that we were now to be blindfold so that we
should not learn the secret of the path through the bowel of the
mountain to thi i of cours assent cheerfulli enough but job
who wa now veri much better notwithstand the journei did not like
it at all fanci i believ that it wa but a preliminari step to
be hotpot he wa howev a littl consol when i point out
to him that there were no hot pot at hand and so far as i knew no
fire to heat them in as for poor leo after turn restlessli for
hour he had to my deep thank at last drop off into a sleep
or stupor i do not know which so there wa no need to blindfold him
the blindfold wa perform by bind a piec of the yellowish linen
whereof those of the amahagg who condescend to wear anyth in
particular made their dress tightli round the ey thi linen i
afterward discov wa taken from the tomb and wa not as i had at
first suppos of nativ manufactur the bandag wa then knot at
the back of the head and final brought down again and the end bound
under the chin to prevent it slip ustan wa by the wai also
blindfold i do not know why unless it wa from fear that she should
impart the secret of the rout to us
thi oper perform we start on onc more and soon by the
echo sound of the footstep of the bearer and the increas nois
of the water caus by reverber in a confin space i knew that
we were enter into the bowel of the great mountain it wa an eeri
sensat be born along into the dead heart of the rock we knew not
whither but i wa get us to eeri sensat by thi time and by
now wa pretti well prepar for anyth so i lai still and listen
to the tramp tramp of the bearer and the rush of the water and
tri to believ that i wa enjoi myself present the men set up
the melancholi littl chant that i had heard on the first night when we
were captur in the whaleboat and the effect produc by their voic
wa veri curiou and quit indescrib after a while the air began
to get exceedingli thick and heavi so much so inde that i felt as
though i were go to choke till at length the litter took a sharp
turn then anoth and anoth and the sound of the run water
ceas after thi the air wa fresher again but the turn were
continu and to me blindfold as i wa most bewild i tri
to keep a map of them in my mind in case it might ever be necessari
for us to try and escap by thi rout but needless to sai fail
utterli anoth halfhour or so pass and then suddenli i becam
awar that we were onc more in the open air i could see the light
through my bandag and feel it fresh on my face a few more minut
and the caravan halt and i heard billali order ustan to remov her
bandag and undo our without wait for her attent i got the knot
of mine loos and look out
as i anticip we had pass right through the precipic and were
now on the farther side and immedi beneath it beetl face the
first thing i notic wa that the cliff is not nearli so high here not
so high i should sai by five hundr feet which prove that the bed of
the lake or rather of the vast ancient crater in which we stood wa
much abov the level of the surround plain for the rest we found
ourselv in a huge rocksurround cup not unlik that of the first
place where we had sojourn onli ten time the size inde i could
onli just make out the frown line of the opposit cliff a great
portion of the plain thu enclos by natur wa cultiv and fenc
in with wall of stone place there to keep the cattl and goat of
which there were larg herd about from break into the garden
here and there rose great grass mound and some mile awai toward the
centr i thought that i could see the outlin of coloss ruin i had
no time to observ anyth more at the moment for we were instantli
surround by crowd of amahagg similar in everi particular to those
with whom we were alreadi familiar who though thei spoke littl
press round us so close as to obscur the view to a person ly
in a hammock then all of a sudden a number of arm men arrang in
compani and marshal by offic who held ivori wand in their
hand came run swiftli toward us have so far as i could
make out emerg from the face of the precipic like ant from their
burrow these men as well as their offic were all robe in addit
to the usual leopard skin and as i gather form the bodyguard of
she herself
their leader advanc to billali salut him by place hi ivori wand
transvers across hi forehead and then ask some question which
i could not catch and billali have answer him the whole regiment
turn and march along the side of the cliff our cavalcad of litter
follow in their track after go thu for about half a mile we
halt onc more in front of the mouth of a tremend cave measur
about sixti feet in height by eighti wide and here billali descend
final and request job and myself to do the same leo of cours
wa far too ill to do anyth of the sort i did so and we enter the
great cave into which the light of the set sun penetr for
some distanc while beyond the reach of the daylight it wa faintli
illumin with lamp which seem to me to stretch awai for an almost
immeasur distanc like the ga light of an empti london street
the first thing i notic wa that the wall were cover with
sculptur in basrelief of a sort pictori speak similar to
those that i have describ upon the vaseslovescen princip
then hunt pictur pictur of execut and the tortur of
crimin by the place of a presum redhot pot upon the head
show whenc our host had deriv thi pleasant practic there
were veri few battlepiec though mani of duel and men run and
wrestl and from thi fact i am led to believ that thi peopl were
not much subject to attack by exterior foe either on account of the
isol of their posit or becaus of their great strength between
the pictur were column of stone charact of a format absolut
new to me at ani rate thei were neither greek nor egyptian nor
hebrew nor assyrianthat i am sure of thei look more like chines
write than ani other that i am acquaint with near to the entranc
of the cave both pictur and write were worn awai but further in
thei were in mani case absolut fresh and perfect as the dai on which
the sculptor had ceas work on them
the regiment of guard did not come further than the entranc to the
cave where thei form up to let us pass through on enter the place
itself we were howev met by a man robe in white who bow humbl
but said noth which as it afterward appear that he wa a deaf
mute wa not veri wonder
run at right angl to the great cave at a distanc of some twenti
feet from the entranc wa a smaller cave or wide galleri that wa
pierc into the rock both to the right and to the left of the main
cavern in front of the galleri to our left stood two guard from which
circumst i argu that it wa the entranc to the apart of
she herself the mouth of the righthand galleri wa unguard and
along it the mute indic that we were to go walk a few yard down
thi passag which wa light with lamp we came to the entranc of
a chamber have a curtain made of some grass materi not unlik a
zanzibar mat in appear hung over the doorwai thi the mute drew
back with anoth profound obeis and led the wai into a goodsiz
apart hewn of cours out of the solid rock but to my great
relief light by mean of a shaft pierc in the face of the precipic
in thi room wa a stone bedstead pot full of water for wash and
beautifulli tan leopard skin to serv as blanket
here we left leo who wa still sleep heavili and with him stop
ustan i notic that the mute gave her a veri sharp look as much
as to sai who ar you and by whose order do you come here then he
conduct us to anoth similar room which job took and then to two
more that were respect occupi by billali and myself
xii
she
the first care of job and myself after see to leo wa to wash
ourselv and put on clean cloth for what we were wear had not
been chang sinc the loss of the dhow fortun as i think that
i have said by far the greater part of our person baggag had been
pack into the whaleboat and wa therefor savedand brought hither
by the bearersalthough all the store laid in by us for barter and
present to the nativ wa lost nearli all our cloth wa made of a
wellshrunk and veri strong grei flannel and excel i found it for
travel in these place becaus though a norfolk jacket shirt
and pair of trouser of it onli weigh about four pound a great
consider in a tropic countri where everi extra ounc tell on
the wearer it wa warm and offer a good resist to the rai of
the sun and best of all to chill which ar so apt to result from
sudden chang of temperatur
never shall i forget the comfort of the wash and brushup and of
those clean flannel the onli thing that wa want to complet my joi
wa a cake of soap of which we had none
afterward i discov that the amahagg who do not reckon dirt among
their mani disagre qualiti us a kind of burnt earth for wash
purpos which though unpleas to the touch till on get accustom
to it form a veri fair substitut for soap
by the time that i wa dress and had comb and trim my black
beard the previou condit of which wa certainli suffici
unkempt to give weight to billali appel for me of baboon i
began to feel most uncommonli hungri therefor i wa by no mean sorri
when without the slightest preparatori sound or warn the curtain
over the entranc to my cave wa flung asid and anoth mute a
young girl thi time announc to me by sign that i could not
misunderstandthat is by open her mouth and point down itthat
there wa someth readi to eat accordingli i follow her into the
next chamber which we had not yet enter where i found job who had
also to hi great embarrass been conduct thither by a fair mute
job never got over the advanc the former ladi had made toward him
and suspect everi girl who came near to him of similar design
these young parti have a wai of look at on sir he would sai
apologet which i dont call respect
thi chamber wa twice the size of the sleep cave and i saw at onc
that it had origin serv as a refectori and also probabl as an
embalm room for the priest of the dead for i mai as well sai at
onc that these hollowedout cave were noth more nor less than vast
catacomb in which for ten of ag the mortal remain of the great
extinct race whose monument surround us had been first preserv
with an art and a complet that ha never sinc been equal
and then hidden awai for all time on each side of thi particular
rockchamb wa a long and solid stone tabl about three feet wide by
three feet six in height hewn out of the live rock of which it had
form part and wa still attach to at the base these tabl were
slightli hollow out or curv inward to give room for the knee of
ani on sit on the stone ledg that had been cut for a bench along
the side of the cave at a distanc of about two feet from them each of
them also wa so arrang that it end right under a shaft pierc
in the rock for the admiss of light and air on examin them
carefulli howev i saw that there wa a differ between them that
had at first escap my attent viz that on of the tabl that
to the left as we enter the cave had evid been us not to
eat upon but for the purpos of embalm that thi wa beyond all
question the case wa clear from five shallow depress in the stone
of the tabl all shape like a human form with a separ place
for the head to lie in and a littl bridg to support the neck each
depress be of a differ size so as to fit bodi vari in
statur from a fullgrown man to a small child and with littl
hole bore at interv to carri off fluid and inde if ani further
confirm wa requir we had but to look at the wall of the cave
abov to find it for there sculptur all round the apart and
look nearli as fresh as the dai it wa done wa the pictori
represent of the death embalm and burial of an old man with a
long beard probabl an ancient king or grande of thi countri
the first pictur repres hi death he wa ly upon a couch which
had four short curv post at the corner come to a knob at the end
in appear someth like written note of music and wa evid
in the veri act of expir gather round the couch were women and
children weep the former with their hair hang down their back
the next scene repres the embalm of the bodi which lai stark
upon a tabl with depress in it similar to the on befor us
probabl inde it wa a pictur of the same tabl three men were
emploi at the workon superintend on hold a funnel shape
exactli like a port wine strainer of which the narrow end wa fix in
an incis in the breast no doubt in the great pector arteri while
the third who wa depict as stand straddleleg over the corps
held a kind of larg jug high in hi hand and pour from it some
steam fluid which fell accur into the funnel the most curiou
part of thi sculptur is that both the man with the funnel and the
man who pour the fluid ar drawn hold their nose either i suppos
becaus of the stench aris from the bodi or more probabl to keep
out the aromat fume of the hot fluid which wa be forc into the
dead man vein anoth curiou thing which i am unabl to explain is
that all three men were repres as have a band of linen ti round
the face with hole in it for the ey
the third sculptur wa a pictur of the burial of the deceas there
he wa stiff and cold cloth in a linen robe and laid out on a stone
slab such as i had slept upon at our first sojourningplac at hi
head and feet burnt lamp and by hi side were place sever of
the beauti paint vase that i have describ which were perhap
suppos to be full of provis the littl chamber wa crowd with
mourner and with musician plai on an instrument resembl a lyre
while near the foot of the corps stood a man hold a sheet with
which he wa prepar to cover it from view
these sculptur look at mere as work of art were so remark
that i make no apolog for describ them rather fulli thei struck
me also as be of surpass interest as repres probabl with
studiou accuraci the last rite of the dead as practis among
an utterli lost peopl and even then i thought how enviou some
antiquarian friend of my own at cambridg would be if ever i found an
opportun of describ these wonder remain to them probabl thei
would sai that i wa exagger notwithstand that everi page of
thi histori must bear so much intern evid of it truth that it
would obvious have been quit imposs for me to have invent it
to return as soon as i had hastili examin these sculptur which
i think i omit to mention were execut in relief we sat down to a
veri excel meal of boil goatsflesh fresh milk and cake made
of meal the whole be serv upon clean wooden platter
when we had eaten we return to see how leo wa get on billali
sai that he must now wait upon she and hear her command on
reach leo room we found the poor boi in a veri bad wai he had woke
up from hi torpor and wa altogeth off hi head babbl about some
boatrac on the cam and wa inclin to be violent inde when we
enter the room ustan wa hold him down i spoke to him and my
voic seem to sooth him at ani rate he grew much quieter and wa
persuad to swallow a dose of quinin
i had been sit with him for an hour perhapsat ani rate i know
that it wa get so dark that i could onli just make out hi head
ly like a gleam of gold upon the pillow we had extemporis out of a
bag cover with a blanketwhen suddenli billali arriv with an air
of great import and inform me that she herself had deign to
express a wish to see mean honour he ad accord to but veri
few i think that he wa a littl horrifi at my cool wai of take the
honour but the fact wa that i did not feel overwhelm with gratitud
at the prospect of see some savag duski queen howev absolut
and mysteri she might be more especi as my mind wa full of
dear leo for whose life i began to have great fear howev i rose to
follow him and as i did so i caught sight of someth bright ly on
the floor which i pick up perhap the reader will rememb that with
the potsherd in the casket wa a composit scarabu mark with a
round o a goos and anoth curiou hieroglyph the mean of which
is suten se ra or royal son of the sun the scarab which is a veri
small on leo had insist upon have set in a massiv gold ring such
as is gener us for signet and it wa thi veri ring that i now
pick up he had pull it off in the paroxysm of hi fever at least
i suppos so and flung it down upon the rockfloor think that if i
left it about it might get lost i slip it on my own littl finger
and then follow billali leav job and ustan with leo
we pass down the passag cross the great aislelik cave and came
to the correspond passag on the other side at the mouth of which
the guard stood like two statu as we came thei bow their head in
salut and then lift their long spear place them transvers
across their forehead as the leader of the troop that had met us
had done with their ivori wand we step between them and found
ourselv in an exactli similar galleri to that which led to our own
apart onli thi passag wa compar speak brilliantli
light a few pace down it we were met by four mutestwo men and two
womenwho bow low and then arrang themselv the women in front
and the men behind of us and in thi order we continu our process
past sever doorwai hung with curtain resembl those lead to
our own quarter and which i afterward found open out into chamber
occupi by the mute who attend on she a few pace more and we
came to anoth doorwai face us and not to our left like the other
which seem to mark the termin of the passag here two more
white or rather yellowrob guard were stand and thei too
bow salut and let us pass through heavi curtain into a great
antechamb quit forti feet long by as mani wide in which some eight
or ten women most of them young and handsom with yellowish hair sat
on cushion work with ivori needl at what had the appear of
be embroideri frame these women were also deaf and dumb at the
farther end of thi great lamplit apart wa anoth doorwai close
in with heavi orientallook curtain quit unlik those that hung
befor the door of our own room and here stood two particularli
handsom girl mute their head bow upon their bosom and their hand
cross in an attitud of humbl submiss as we advanc thei each
stretch out an arm and drew back the curtain thereupon billali did
a curiou thing down he went that venerablelook old gentlemanfor
billali is a gentleman at the bottomdown on to hi hand and knee
and in thi undignifi posit with hi long white beard trail on
the ground he began to creep into the apart beyond i follow him
stand on my feet in the usual fashion look over hi shoulder he
perceiv it
down my son down my baboon down on to thy hand and knee we enter
the presenc of she and if thou art not humbl of a sureti she will
blast thee where thou standest
i halt and felt scare inde my knee began to give wai of their
own mere motion but reflect came to my aid i wa an englishman
and why i ask myself should i creep into the presenc of some savag
woman as though i were a monkei in fact as well as in name i would not
and could not do it that is unless i wa absolut sure that my life
or comfort depend upon it if onc i began to creep upon my knee i
should alwai have to do so and it would be a patent acknowledg of
inferior so fortifi by an insular prejudic against kootoo
which ha like most of our socal prejudic a good deal of common
sens to recommend it i march in boldli after billali i found myself
in anoth apart consider smaller than the anteroom of which
the wall were entir hung with richlook curtain of the same make
as those over the door the work as i subsequ discov of the
mute who sat in the antechamb and wove them in strip which were
afterward sewn togeth also here and there about the room were
sette of a beauti black wood of the eboni tribe inlaid with ivori
and all over the floor were other tapestri or rather rug at the top
end of thi apart wa what appear to be a recess also drape with
curtain through which shone rai of light there wa nobodi in the
place except ourselv
painfulli and slowli old billali crept up the length of the cave and
with the most dignifi stride that i could command i follow after
him but i felt that it wa more or less of a failur to begin with it
is not possibl to look dignifi when you ar follow in the wake
of an old man writh along on hi stomach like a snake and then
in order to go suffici slowli either i had to keep my leg some
second in the air at everi step or els to advanc with a full stop
between each stride like mari queen of scot go to execut in a
plai billali wa not good at crawl i suppos hi year stood in the
wai and our progress up that apart wa a veri long affair i wa
immedi behind him and sever time i wa sore tempt to help
him on with a good kick it is so absurd to advanc into the presenc of
savag royalti after the fashion of an irishman drive a pig to market
for that is what we look like and the idea nearli made me burst out
laugh then and there i had to work off my danger tendenc to
unseemli merriment by blow my nose a proceed which fill old
billali with horror for he look over hi shoulder and made a ghastli
face at me and i heard him murmur oh my poor baboon
at last we reach the curtain and here billali collaps flat on to
hi stomach with hi hand stretch out befor him as though he were
dead and i not know what to do began to stare about the place but
present i clearli felt that somebodi wa look at me from behind the
curtain i could not see the person but i could distinctli feel hi
or her gaze and what is more it produc a veri odd effect upon my
nerv i wa frighten i do not know why the place wa a strang
on it is true and look lone notwithstand it rich hang
and the soft glow of the lampsinde these accessori ad to
rather than detract from it loneli just as a light street at
night ha alwai a more solitari appear than a dark on it wa
so silent in the place and there lai billali like on dead befor the
heavi curtain through which the odour of perfum seem to float up
toward the gloom of the arch roof abov minut grew into minut and
still there wa no sign of life nor did the curtain move but i felt
the gaze of the unknown be sink through and through me and
fill me with a nameless terror till the perspir stood in bead
upon my brow
at length the curtain began to move who could be behind itsom nake
savag queen a languish orient beauti or a nineteenthcenturi
young ladi drink afternoon tea i had not the slightest idea
and should not have been astonish at see ani of the three i wa
get beyond astonish the curtain agit itself a littl then
suddenli between it fold there appear a most beauti white hand
white as snow and with long taper finger end in the pinkest
nail the hand grasp the curtain and drew it asid and as it did so
i heard a voic i think the softest and yet most silveri voic i ever
heard it remind me of the murmur of a brook
stranger said the voic in arab but much purer and more classic
arab than the amahagg talkstrang wherefor art thou so much
afraid
now i flatter myself that in spite of my inward terror i had kept
a veri fair command of my counten and wa therefor a littl
astonish at thi question befor i had made up my mind how to answer
it howev the curtain wa drawn and a tall figur stood befor us i
sai a figur for not onli the bodi but also the face wa wrap up in
soft white gauzi materi in such a wai as at first sight to remind me
most forcibl of a corps in it gravecloth and yet i do not know
why it should have given me that idea see that the wrap were so
thin that on could distinctli see the gleam of the pink flesh beneath
them i suppos it wa ow to the wai in which thei were arrang
either accident or more probabl by design anyhow i felt more
frighten than ever at thi ghostlik apparit and my hair began
to rise upon my head as the feel crept over me that i wa in the
presenc of someth that wa not canni i could howev clearli
distinguish that the swath mummylik form befor me wa that of a
tall and love woman instinct with beauti in everi part and also
with a certain snakelik grace which i had never seen anyth to
equal befor when she move a hand or foot her entir frame seem to
undul and the neck did not bend it curv
why art thou so frighten stranger ask the sweet voic againa
voic which seem to draw the heart out of me like the strain of
softest music is there that about me that should affright a man then
sure ar men chang from what thei us to be and with a littl
coquettish movement she turn herself and held up on arm so as
to show all her loveli and the rich hair of raven black that
stream in soft rippl down her snowi robe almost to her sandal
feet
it is thy beauti that make me fear oh queen i answer humbl
scarc know what to sai and i thought that as i did so i heard old
billali who wa still ly prostrat on the floor mutter good my
baboon good
i see that men still know how to beguil us women with fals word ah
stranger she answer with a laugh that sound like distant silver
bell thou wast afraid becaus mine ey were search out thine
heart therefor wast thou afraid yet be but a woman i forgiv thee
for the lie for it wa courteous said and now tell me how came ye
hither to thi land of the dweller among the cavesa land of swamp
and evil thing and dead old shadow of the dead what came ye for to
see how is it that ye hold your live so cheap as to place
them in the hollow of the hand of hiya into the hand of
shewhomustbeobei tell me also how come ye to know the tongu
i talk it is an ancient tongu that sweet child of the old syriac
liveth it yet in the world thou seest i dwell among the cave and the
dead and naught know i of the affair of men nor have i care to know
i have live o stranger with my memori and my memori ar in a
grave that mine hand hollow for truli hath it been said that
the child of man maketh hi own path evil and her beauti voic
quiver and broke in a note as soft as ani woodbird suddenli
her ey fell upon the sprawl frame of billali and she seem to
recollect herself
ah thou art there old man tell me how it is that thing have gone
wrong in thine household forsooth it seem that these my guest were
set upon ay and on wa nigh to be slain by the hotpot to be eaten
of those brute thy children and had not the other fought gallantli
thei too had been slain and not even i could have call back the life
which had been loos from the bodi what mean it old man what hast
thou to sai that i should not give thee over to those who execut my
vengeanc
her voic had risen in her anger and it rang clear and cold against the
rocki wall also i thought i could see her ey flash through the gauz
that hid them i saw poor billali whom i had believ to be a veri
fearless person posit quiver with terror at her word
oh hiya oh she he said without lift hi white head from the
floor oh she as thou art great be merci for i am now as ever
thy servant to obei it wa no plan or fault of mine oh she it wa
those wick on who ar call my children led on by a woman whom thy
guest the pig had scorn thei would have follow the ancient custom
of the land and eaten the fat black stranger who came hither with these
thy guest the baboon and the lion who is sick think that no word
had come from thee about the black on but when the baboon and the lion
saw what thei would do thei slew the woman and slew also their servant
to save him from the horror of the pot then those evil on ay those
children of the wick on who live in the pit thei went mad with the
lust of blood and flew at the throat of the lion and the baboon and
the pig but gallantli thei fought oh hiya thei fought like veri
men and slew mani and held their own and then i came and save them
and the evildo have i sent on hither to kr to be judg of thy
great oh she and here thei ar

do justic upon them fear not and for thee i forgiv thee though
hardli see that thou dost keep thine household better go
billali rose upon hi knee with astonish alacr bow hi head
thrice and hi white beard sweep the ground crawl down the
apart as he had crawl up it till he final vanish through the
curtain leav me not a littl to my alarm alon with thi terribl
but most fascin person

befor me like those slave i am aweari of their worship and their
terror sometim when thei vex me i could blast them for veri sport
and to see the rest turn white even to the heart and she held the
curtain asid with her ivori hand to let me pass in
i enter shudder thi woman wa veri terribl within the curtain
wa a recess about twelv feet by ten and in the recess wa a couch
and a tabl whereon stood fruit and sparkl water by it at it end
wa a vessel like a font cut in carv stone also full of pure water
the place wa softli lit with lamp form out of the beauti vessel
of which i have spoken and the air and curtain were laden with a
subtl perfum perfum too seem to eman from the gloriou hair and
whitecling vestment of she herself i enter the littl room
and there stood uncertain

speak thy talk doth lack the music of the sweet tongu of the tribe of
hamyar which i wa wont to hear some of the word too seem chang
even as among these amahagg who have debas and defil it puriti
so that i must speak with them in what is to me anoth tongu
yrab the son of khtan who live some centuri
befor the time of abraham wa the father of the ancient
arab and gave it name araba to the countri in speak

i have studi it i answer for mani year also the languag is
spoken in egypt and elsewher
so it is still spoken and there is yet an egypt and what pharaoh sit
upon the throne still on of the spawn of the persian och or ar
the achmenian gone for far is it to the dai of och
the persian have been gone for egypt for nigh two thousand year and
sinc then the ptolemi the roman and mani other have flourish
and held swai upon the nile and fallen when their time wa ripe i
said aghast what canst thou know of the persian artaxerx
she laugh and made no answer and again a cold chill went through
me and greec she said is there still a greec ah i love the
greek beauti were thei as the dai and clever but fierc at heart
and fickl notwithstand
ye i said there is a greec and just now it is onc more a
peopl yet the greek of todai ar not what the greek of the old time
were and greec herself is but a mockeri of the greec that wa
so the hebrew ar thei yet at jerusalem and doe the templ that
the wise king built stand and if so what god do thei worship therein
is their messiah come of whom thei preach so much and prophesi so
loudli and doth he rule the earth
the jew ar broken and gone and the fragment of their peopl strew
the world and jerusalem is no more as for the templ that herod
built
herod she said i know not herod but go on
the roman burnt it and the roman eagl flew across it ruin and
now juda is a desert
so so thei were a great peopl those roman and went straight to
their endai thei sped to it like fate or like their own eagl on
their preyand left peac behind them
solitudinem faciunt pacem appel i suggest
ah thou canst speak the latin tongu too she said in surpris it
hath a strang ring in my ear after all these dai and it seem to
me that thy accent doe not fall as the roman put it who wa it wrote
that i know not the sai but it is a true on of that great peopl
it seem that i have found a learn manon whose hand have held the
water of the world knowledg knowest thou greek also
ye oh queen and someth of hebrew but not to speak them well
thei ar all dead languag now
she clap her hand in childish glee of a truth ugli tree that thou
art thou growest the fruit of wisdom oh holli she said but of
those jew whom i hate for thei call me heathen when i would have
taught them my philosophydid their messiah come and doth he rule the
world
their messiah came i answer with rever but he came poor and
lowli and thei would have none of him thei scourg him and crucifi
him upon a tree but yet hi word and hi work live on for he wa the
son of god and now of a truth he doth rule half the world but not with
an empir of the world
ah the fierceheart wolv she said the follow of sens and
mani godsgreedi of gain and factiontorn i can see their dark face
yet so thei crucifi their messiah well can i believ it that he wa
a son of the live spirit would be naught to them if inde he wa so
and of that we will talk afterward thei would care naught for ani god
if he came not with pomp and power thei a chosen peopl a vessel
of him thei call jehovah ay and a vessel of baal and a vessel of
astoreth and a vessel of the god of the egyptiansa highstomach
peopl greedi of aught that brought them wealth and power so thei
crucifi their messiah becaus he came in lowli guiseand now ar
thei scatter about the earth why if i rememb so said on of their
prophet that it should be well let them gothei broke my heart
those jew and made me look with evil ey across the world ay and
drove me to thi wilder thi place of a peopl that wa befor
them when i would have taught them wisdom in jerusalem thei stone me
ay at the gate of the templ those whitebeard hypocrit and rabbi
hound the peopl on to stone me see here is the mark of it to thi
dai and with a sudden move she pull up the gauzi wrap on her
round arm and point to a littl scar that show red against it
milki beauti
i shrank back horrifi
pardon me oh queen i said but i am bewild nigh upon two
thousand year have roll across the earth sinc the jewish messiah
hung upon hi cross at golgotha how then canst thou have taught thy
philosophi to the jew befor he wa thou art a woman and no spirit
how can a woman live two thousand year why dost thou befool me oh
queen
she lean back upon the couch and onc more i felt the hidden ey
plai upon me and search out my heart
oh man she said at last speak veri slowli and deliber it
seem that there ar still thing upon the earth of which thou knowest
naught dost thou still believ that all thing die even as those veri
jew believ i tell thee that naught di there is no such thing as
death though there be a thing call chang see and she point to
some sculptur on the rocki wall three time two thousand year have
pass sinc the last of the great race that hew those pictur fell
befor the breath of the pestil which destroi them yet ar thei
not dead een now thei live perchanc their spirit ar drawn toward
us at thi veri hour and she glanc round of a sureti it sometim
seem to me that my ey can see them
ye but to the world thei ar dead
ay for a time but even to the world ar thei born again and again i
ye i ayeshafor that stranger is my namei sai to thee that
i wait now for on i love to be born again and here i tarri till he
find me know of a sureti that hither he will come and that here
and here onli shall he greet me why dost thou believ that i who
am allpow i whose loveli is more than the loveli of the
grecian helen of whom thei us to sing and whose wisdom is wider ay
far more wide and deep than the wisdom of solomon the wisei who know
the secret of the earth and it rich and can turn all thing to
my usesi who have even for a while overcom chang that ye call
deathwhi i sai oh stranger dost thou think that i herd here with
barbarian lower than the beast
pronounc asshal h h
i know not i said humbl
becaus i wait for him i love my life ha perchanc been evil i know
notfor who can sai what is evil and what goodso i fear to die even
if i could die which i cannot until mine hour come to go and seek him
where he is for between us there might rise a wall i could not climb
at least i dread it sure easi would it be also to lose the wai in
seek in those great space wherein the planet wander on for ever
but the dai will come it mai be when five thousand more year have
pass and ar lost and melt into the vault of time even as the
littl cloud melt into the gloom of night or it mai be tomorrow
when he my love shall be born again and then follow a law that
is stronger than ani human plan he shall find me here where onc
he knew me and of a sureti hi heart will soften toward me though i
sin against him ay even though he knew me not again yet will he
love me if onli for my beauti sake
for a moment i wa dumbfound and could not answer the matter wa too
overpow for my intellect to grasp
but even so oh queen i said at last even if we men be born again
and again that is not so with thee if thou speakest truli here she
look up sharpli and onc more i caught the flash of those hidden
ey thou i went on hurriedli who hast never di
that is so she said and it is so becaus i have half by chanc and
half by learn solv on of the great secret of the world tell
me stranger life iswhi therefor should not life be lengthen for a
while what ar ten or twenti or fifti thousand year in the histori of
life why in ten thousand year scarc will the rain and storm lessen
a mountain top by a span in thick in two thousand year these cave
have not chang noth ha chang but the beast and man who is as
the beast there is naught that is wonder about the matter couldst
thou but understand life is wonder ay but that it should be a
littl lengthen is not wonder natur hath her anim spirit as
well as man who is natur child and he who can find that spirit
and let it breath upon him shall live with her life he shall not live
etern for natur is not etern and she herself must die even as
the natur of the moon hath di she herself must die i sai or rather
chang and sleep till it be time for her to live again but when shall
she die not yet i ween and while she live so shall he who hath
all her secret live with her all i have it not yet have i some more
perchanc than ani who were befor me now to thee i doubt not that
thi thing is a great mysteri therefor i will not overcom thee with
it now anoth time i will tell thee more if the mood be on me though
perchanc i shall never speak thereof again dost thou wonder how i
knew that ye were come to thi land and so save your head from the
hotpot

she lift her white and round armsnev had i seen such arm
beforeand slowli veri slowli withdrew some fasten beneath her
hair then all of a sudden the long corpselik wrap fell from her
to the ground and my ey travel up her form now onli robe in
a garb of cling white that did but serv to show it perfect and
imperi shape instinct with a life that wa more than life and with a
certain serpentlik grace that wa more than human on her littl feet
were sandal fasten with stud of gold then came ankl more perfect
than ever sculptor dream of about the waist her white kirtl wa
fasten by a doublehead snake of solid gold abov which her
graciou form swell up in line as pure as thei were love till the
kirtl end on the snowi argent of her breast whereon her arm were
fold i gaze abov them at her face andi do not exaggerateshrank
back blind and amaz i have heard of the beauti of celesti be
now i saw it onli thi beauti with all it aw loveli and
puriti wa evilat least at the time it struck me as evil how am
i to describ it i cannotsimpli i cannot the man doe not live
whose pen could convei a sens of what i saw i might talk of the great
chang ey of deepest softest black of the tint face of the
broad and nobl brow on which the hair grew low and delic straight
featur but beauti surpassingli beauti as thei all were her
loveli did not lie in them it lai rather if it can be said to have
had ani fix abid place in a visibl majesti in an imperi grace
in a godlik stamp of soften power which shone upon that radiant
counten like a live halo never befor had i guess what beauti
made sublim could beand yet the sublim wa a dark oneth glori
wa not all of heaventhough none the less wa it gloriou though
the face befor me wa that of a young woman of certainli not more than
thirti year in perfect health and the first flush of ripen beauti
yet it had stamp upon it a look of unutter experi and of
deep acquaint with grief and passion not even the love smile that
crept about the dimpl of her mouth could hide thi shadow of sin and
sorrow it shone even in the light of the gloriou ey it wa present
in the air of majesti and it seem to sai behold me love as no
woman wa or is undi and halfdivin memori haunt me from ag to
ag and passion lead me by the handevil have i done and from ag to
ag evil i shall do and sorrow shall i know till my redempt come
drawn by some magnet forc which i could not resist i let my ey
rest upon her shine orb and felt a current pass from them to me that
bewild and halfblind me
she laughedah how music and nod her littl head at me with
an air of sublim coquetri that would have done credit to a venu
victrix
rash man she said like acton thou hast had thy will be care
lest like acton thou too dost perish miser torn to piec
by the banhound of thine own passion i too oh holli am a virgin
goddess not to be move of ani man save on and it is not thou sai
hast thou seen enough
i have look on beauti and i am blind i said hoars lift my
hand to cover up my ey
so what did i tell thee beauti is like the lightn it is love
but it destroysespeci tree oh holli and again she nod and
laugh
suddenli she paus and through my finger i saw an aw chang come
over her counten her great ey suddenli fix themselv into an
express in which horror seem to struggl with some tremend hope
aris through the depth of her dark soul the love face grew rigid
and the graciou willowi form seem to erect itself
man she half whisper half hiss throw back her head like a
snake about to strikeman whenc hadst thou that scarab on thy hand
speak or by the spirit of life i will blast thee where thou standest
and she took on light step toward me and from her ey there shone
such an aw lightto me it seem almost like a flamethat i fell
then and there on the ground befor her babbl confusedli in my
terror
peac she said with a sudden chang of manner and speak in her
former soft voic i did affright thee forgiv me but at time oh
holli the almost infinit mind grow impati of the slow of the
veri finit and am i tempt to us my power out of vexationveri
nearli wast thou dead but i rememb but the scarababout the
scarabu
i pick it up i gurgl feebli as i got on to my feet again and
it is a solemn fact that my mind wa so disturb that at the moment i
could rememb noth els about the ring except that i had pick it
up in leo cave
it is veri strang she said with a sudden access of womanlik
trembl and agit which seem out of place in thi aw
womanbut onc i knew a scarab like to that ithung round the
neckof on i love and she gave a littl sob and i saw that after
all she wa onli a woman although she might be a veri old on
there she went on it must be on like to it and yet never did
i see on like to it for thereto hung a histori and he who wore it
prize it much but the scarab that i knew wa not set thu in the
bezel of a ring go now holli go and if thou canst try to forget
that thou hast of thy folli look upon ayesha beauti and turn
from me she flung herself on her couch and buri her face in the
cushion
i am inform by a renown and learn egyptologist to
whom i have submit thi veri interest and beautifulli
finish scarab suten se ra that he ha never seen on
resembl it although it bear a titl frequent given to
egyptian royalti he is of opinion that it is not
necessarili the cartouch of a pharaoh on which either the
throne or person name of the monarch is gener
inscrib what the histori of thi particular scarab mai
have been we can now unfortun never know but i have
littl doubt but that it plai some part in the tragic
stori of the princess amenarta and her lover kallikr
the forsworn priest of isiseditor
as for me i stumbl from her presenc and i do not rememb how i
reach my own cave
xiv
a soul in hell
it wa nearli ten oclock at night when i cast myself down upon my bed
and began to gather my scatter wit and reflect upon what i had seen
and heard but the more i reflect the less i could make of it wa i
mad or drunk or dream or wa i mere the victim of a gigant
and most elabor hoax how wa it possibl that i a ration man
not unacquaint with the lead scientif fact of our histori and
hitherto an absolut and utter disbeliev in all the hocuspocu which
in europ goe by the name of the supernatur could believ that i had
within the last few minut been engag in convers with a woman
two thousand and odd year old the thing wa contrari to the experi
of human natur and absolut and utterli imposs it must be a
hoax and yet if it were a hoax what wa i to make of it what too
wa to be said of the figur on the water of the woman extraordinari
acquaint with the remot past and her ignor or appar
ignor of ani subsequ histori what too of her wonder and
aw loveli thi at ani rate wa a patent fact and beyond the
experi of the world no mere mortal woman could shine with such
a supernatur radianc about that she had at ani rate been in the
rightit wa not safe for ani man to look upon such beauti i wa
a harden vessel in such matter have with the except of on
pain experi of my green and tender youth put the softer sex
i sometim think that thi is a misnom almost entir out of my
thought but now to my intens horror i knew that i could never put
awai the vision of those gloriou ey and ala the veri diableri
of the woman whilst it horrifi and repel attract in even a
greater degre a person with the experi of two thousand year at
her back with the command of such tremend power and the knowledg
of a mysteri that could hold off death wa certainli worth fall
in love with if ever woman wa but ala it wa not a question of
whether or no she wa worth it for so far as i could judg not be
vers in such matter i a fellow of my colleg note for what my
acquaint ar pleas to call my misogyni and a respect man
now well on in middl life had fallen absolut and hopelessli in love
with thi white sorceress nonsens it must be nonsens she had warn
me fairli and i had refus to take the warn curs on the fatal
curios that is ever prompt man to draw the veil from woman
and curs on the natur impuls that beget it it is the caus of
halfai and more than halfof our misfortun why cannot man be
content to live alon and be happi and let the women live alon and be
happi too but perhap thei would not be happi and i am not sure that
we should either here is a nice state of affair i at my ag to fall
a victim to thi modern circ but then she wa not modern at least she
said not she wa almost as ancient as the origin circ
i tore my hair and jump up from my couch feel that if i did
not do someth i should go off my head what did she mean about the
scarabu too it wa leo scarabu and had come out of the old
coffer that vincei had left in my room nearli oneandtwenti year
befor could it be after all that the whole stori wa true and
the write on the sherd wa not a forgeri or the invent of some
crackbrain longforgotten individu and if so could it be that
leo wa the man that she wa wait forth dead man who wa to be
born again imposs the whole thing wa gibberish who ever heard of
a man be born again
but if it were possibl that a woman could exist for two thousand year
thi might be possibl alsoanyth might be possibl i myself might
for aught i knew be a reincarn of some other forgotten self or
perhap the last of a long line of ancestr selv well vive la
guerr why not onli unfortun i had no recollect of these
previou condit the idea wa so absurd to me that i burst out
laugh and address the sculptur pictur of a grimlook
warrior on the cave wall call out to him aloud who know old
fellowperhap i wa your contemporari by jove perhap i wa you and
you ar i and then i laugh again at my own folli and the sound of
my laughter rang dismal along the vault roof as though the ghost of
the warrior had echo the ghost of a laugh
next i bethought me that i had not been to see how leo wa so take
up on of the lamp which wa burn at my bedsid i slip off my
shoe and crept down the passag to the entranc of hi sleep cave
the draught of the night air wa lift hi curtain to and fro gentli
as though spirit hand were draw and redraw it i slid into the
vaultlik apart and look round there wa a light by which i
could see that leo wa ly on the couch toss restlessli in hi
fever but asleep at hi side halfli on the floor halflean
against the stone couch wa ustan she held hi hand in on of her
but she too wa doze and the two made a pretti or rather a pathet
pictur poor leo hi cheek wa burn red there were dark shadow
beneath hi ey and hi breath came heavili he wa veri veri ill
and again the horribl fear seiz me that he might die and i be left
alon in the world and yet if he live he would perhap be my rival
with ayesha even if he were not the man what chanc should i
middleag and hideou have against hi bright youth and beauti well
thank heaven my sens of right wa not dead she had not kill that
yet and as i stood there i prai to heaven in my heart that my boi
my more than son might liveai even if he prove to be the man
then i went back as softli as i had come but still i could not sleep
the sight and thought of dear leo ly there so ill had but ad fuel
to the fire of my unrest my weari bodi and overstrain mind awaken
all my imagin into preternatur activ idea vision almost
inspir float befor it with startl vivid most of them
were grotesqu enough some were ghastli some recal thought and
sensat that had for year been buri in the dbri of my past
life but behind and abov them all hover the shape of that aw
woman and through them gleam the memori of her entranc loveli
up and down the cave i strodeup and down
suddenli i observ what i had not notic befor that there wa a
narrow apertur in the rocki wall i took up the lamp and examin it
the apertur led to a passag now i wa still suffici sensibl
to rememb that it is not pleasant in such a situat as our wa to
have passag run into on bedchamb from no on know where if
there ar passag peopl can come up them thei can come up when on
is asleep partli to see where it went to and partli from a restless
desir to be do someth i follow the passag it led to a stone
stair which i descend the stair end in anoth passag or rather
tunnel also hewn out of the bedrock and run so far as i could
judg exactli beneath the galleri that led to the entranc of our
room and across the great central cave i went on down it it wa as
silent as the grave but still drawn by some sensat or attract
that i cannot defin i follow on my stocking feet fall without
nois on the smooth and rocki floor when i had travers some fifti
yard of space i came to anoth passag run at right angl and
here an aw thing happen to me the sharp draught caught my lamp
and extinguish it leav me in utter dark in the bowel of that
mysteri place i took a coupl of stride forward so as to clear the
bisect tunnel be terribl afraid lest i should turn up it in
the dark if onc i got confus as to the direct and then paus to
think what wa i to do i had no match it seem aw to attempt that
long journei back through the utter gloom and yet i could not stand
there all night and if i did probabl it would not help me much for
in the bowel of the rock it would be as dark at middai as at midnight
i look back over my shouldernot a sight or a sound i peer forward
into the dark sure far awai i saw someth like the faint glow
of fire perhap it wa a cave where i could get a lightat ani rate
it wa worth investig slowli and painfulli i crept along the
tunnel keep my hand against it wall and feel at everi step with
my foot befor i put it down fear lest i should fall into some
pit thirti pacesther wa a light a broad light that came and went
shine through curtain fifti pacesit wa close at hand sixtyoh
great heaven
i wa at the curtain and thei did not hang close so i could see
clearli into the littl cavern beyond them it had all the appear of
be a tomb and wa lit up by a fire that burnt in it centr with a
whitish flame and without smoke inde there to the left wa a stone
shelf with a littl ledg to it three inch or so high and on the
shelf lai what i took to be a corps at ani rate it look like on
with someth white thrown over it to the right wa a similar shelf
on which lai some broider cover over the fire bent the figur of
a woman she wa sidewai to me and face the corps wrap in a dark
mantl that hid her like a nun cloak she seem to be stare at the
flicker flame suddenli as i wa try to make up my mind what
to do with a convuls movement that somehow gave an impress of
despair energi the woman rose to her feet and cast the dark cloak
from her
it wa she herself
she wa cloth as i had seen her when she unveil in the kirtl of
cling white cut low upon her bosom and bound in at the waist with
the barbar doublehead snake and as befor her rippl black
hair fell in heavi mass down her back but her face wa what caught my
ey and held me as in a vice not thi time by the forc of it beauti
but by the power of fascin terror the beauti wa still there
inde but the agoni the blind passion and the aw vindict
displai upon those quiver featur and in the tortur look of the
upturn ey were such as surpass my power of descript
for a moment she stood still her hand rais high abov her head and
as she did so the white robe slip from her down to her golden girdl
bare the blind loveli of her form she stood there her finger
clench and the aw look of malevol gather and deepen on her
face
suddenli i thought of what would happen if she discov me and the
reflect made me turn sick and faint but even if i had known that i
must die if i stop i do not believ that i could have move for
i wa absolut fascin but still i knew my danger suppos she
should hear me or see me through the curtain suppos i even sneez
or that her magic told her that she wa be watchedswift inde
would be my doom
down came the clench hand to her side then up again abov her head
and as i am a live and honour man the white flame of the fire
leapt up after them almost to the roof throw a fierc and ghastli
glare upon she herself upon the white figur beneath the cover
and everi scroll and detail of the rockwork
down came the ivori arm again and as thei did so she spoke or rather
hiss in arab in a note that curdl my blood and for a second
stop my heart
curs her mai she be everlastingli accurs
the arm fell and the flame sank up thei went again and the broad
tongu of fire shot up after them and then again thei fell
curs her memoryaccurs be the memori of the egyptian
up again and again down
curs her the daughter of the nile becaus of her beauti
curs her becaus her magic hath prevail against me
curs her becaus she held my belov from me
and again the flame dwindl and shrank
she put her hand befor her ey and abandon the hiss tone
cri aloud
what is the us of cursingsh prevail and she is gone
then she recommenc with an even more fright energi
curs her where she is let my curs reach her where she is and
disturb her rest
curs her through the starri space let her shadow be accurs
let my power find her even there
let her hear me even there let her hide herself in the black
let her go down into the pit of despair becaus i shall on dai find
her
again the flame fell and again she cover her ey with her hand
it is of no useno us she wail who can reach those who sleep
not even i can reach them
then onc more she began her unholi rite
curs her when she shall be born again let her be born accurs
let her be utterli accus from the hour of her birth until sleep find
her
yea then let her be accurs for then shall i overtak her with my
vengeanc and utterli destroi her
and so on the flame rose and fell reflect itself in her agonis
ey the hiss sound of her terribl maledict and no word of
mine can convei how terribl thei were ran round the wall and di
awai in littl echo and the fierc light and deep gloom altern
themselv on the white and dread form stretch upon that bier of
stone
but at length she seem to wear herself out and ceas she sat herself
down upon the rocki floor shook the dens cloud of her beauti hair
over her face and breast and began to sob terribl in the tortur of a
heartrend despair
two thousand year she moanedtwo thousand year have i want and
endur but though centuri doth still creep on to centuri and time
give place to time the sting of memori hath not lessen the light of
hope doth not shine more bright oh to have live two thousand year
with all my passion eat out my heart and with my sin ever befor me
oh that for me life cannot bring forget oh for the weari year
that have been and ar yet to come and evermor to come endless and
without end
my love my love my love why did that stranger bring thee back to me
after thi sort for five hundr year i have not suffer thu oh
if i sin against thee have i not wipe awai the sin when wilt thou
come back to me who have all and yet without thee have naught what is
there that i can do what what what and perchanc sheperch that
egyptian doth abid with thee where thou art and mock my memori oh
why could i not die with thee i who slew thee ala that i cannot die
ala ala and she flung herself prone upon the ground and sob and
wept till i thought her heart must burst
suddenli she ceas rais herself to her feet rearrang her robe
and toss back her long lock impati swept across to where the
figur lai upon the stone
oh kallikr she cri and i trembl at the name i must look
upon thy face again though it be agoni it is a gener sinc
i look upon thee whom i slewslew with mine own hand and with
trembl finger she seiz the corner of the sheetlik wrap that
cover the form upon the stone bier and then paus when she spoke
again it wa in a kind of aw whisper as though her idea were
terribl even to herself
shall i rais thee she said appar address the corps so
that thou standest there befor me as of old i can do it and she
held out her hand over the sheet dead while her whole frame becam
rigid and terribl to see and her ey grew fix and dull i shrank in
horror behind the curtain my hair stood up upon my head and whether
it wa my imagin or a fact i am unabl to sai but i thought that
the quiet form beneath the cover began to quiver and the wind
sheet to lift as though it lai on the breast of on who slept suddenli
she withdrew her hand and the motion of the corps seem to me to
ceas
to what purpos she said gloomili of what good is it to recal the
semblanc of life when i cannot recal the spirit even if thou stoodest
befor me thou wouldst not know me and couldst but do what i bid thee
the life in thee would be my life and not thy life kallikr
for a moment she stood there brood and then cast herself down on her
knee besid the form and began to press her lip against the sheet
and weep there wa someth so horribl about the sight of thi
aweinspir woman let loos her passion on the deadso much more
horribl even than anyth that had gone beforethat i could no longer
bear to look at it and turn began to creep shake as i wa in
everi limb slowli along the pitchdark passag feel in my trembl
heart that i had seen a vision of a soul in hell
on i stumbl i scarc know how twice i fell onc i turn up the
bisect passag but fortun found out my mistak in time for
twenti minut or more i crept along till at last it occur to me
that i must have pass the littl stair by which i had descend so
utterli exhaust and nearli frighten to death i sank down at length
there on the stone floor and sank into oblivion
when i came to i notic a faint rai of light in the passag just behind
me i crept to it and found it wa the littl stair down which the weak
dawn wa steal pass up it i gain my chamber in safeti and
fling myself on the couch wa soon lost in slumber or rather stupor
xv
ayesha give judgment
the next thing that i rememb wa open my ey and perceiv the
form of job who had now practic recov from hi attack of fever
he wa stand in the rai of light that pierc into the cave from
the outer air shake out my cloth as a makeshift for brush them
which he could not do becaus there wa no brush and then fold them
up neatli and lai them on the foot of the stone couch thi done he
got my travel dressingcas out of the gladston bag and open it
readi for my us first he stood it on the foot of the couch also then
be afraid i suppos that i should kick it off he place it on a
leopard skin on the floor and stood back a step or two to observ the
effect it wa not satisfactori so he shut up the bag turn it on
end and have rest it against the foot of the couch place the
dressingcas on it next he look at the pot full of water which
constitut our wash apparatu ah i heard him murmur no hot
water in thi beastli place i suppos these poor creatur onli us it
to boil each other in and he sigh deepli
what is the matter job i said
beg pardon sir he said touch hi hair i thought you were
asleep sir and i am sure you seem as though you want it on might
think from the look of you that you had been have a night of it
i onli groan by wai of answer i had inde been have a night of
it such as i hope never to have again
how is mr leo job
much the same sir if he dont soon mend hell end sir and that
all about it though i must sai that that there savag ustan do
do her best for him almost like a baptis christian she is alwai
hang round and look after him and if i ventur to interfer it
aw to see her her hair seem to stand on end and she curs and
swear awai in her heathen talkat least i fanci she must be curs
from the look of her
and what do you do then
i make her a perlit bow and i sai young woman your posit is on
that i dont quit understand and cant recognis let me tell you that
i ha a duti to perform to my master as is incapacit by ill
and that i am go to perform it until i am incapacit too but
she dont take no heed not sheonli curs and swear awai wors than
ever last night she put her hand under that sort of nightshirt she
wear and whip out a knife with a kind of a curl in the blade so i
whip out my revolv and we walk round and round each other till at
last she burst out laugh it isnt nice treatment for a christian
man to have to put up with from a savag howev handsom she mai be
but it is what peopl must expect as is fool enough job laid great
emphasi on the fool to come to such a place to look for thing no
man is meant to find it a judgment on us sirthat my view and i
for on is of opinion that the judgment isnt half done yet and when
it is done we shall be done too and just stop in these beastli cave
with the ghost and the corpses for onc and all and now sir i
must be see about mr leo broth if that wild cat will let me and
perhap you would like to get up sir becaus it past nine oclock
job remark were not of an exactli cheer order to a man who had
pass such a night as i had and what is more thei had the weight of
truth take on thing with anoth it appear to me to be an utter
imposs that we should escap from the place we were suppos
that leo recov and suppos that she would let us go which wa
exceedingli doubt and that she did not blast us in some moment of
vexat and that we were not hotpot by the amahagg it would be
quit imposs for us to find our wai across the network of marsh
which stretch for score and score of mile form a stronger and
more impass fortif round the variou amahagg household
than ani that could be built or design by man no there wa but
on thing to dofac it out and speak for my own part i wa so
intens interest in the whole weird stori that so far as i wa
concern notwithstand the shatter state of my nerv i ask
noth better even if my life paid forfeit to my curios what man
for whom physiolog ha charm could forbear to studi such a charact
as that of thi ayesha when the opportun of do so present
itself the veri terror of the pursuit ad to it fascin and
besid as i wa forc to own to myself even now in the sober light of
dai she herself had attract that i could not forget not even the
dread sight which i had wit dure the night could drive that
folli from my mind and ala that i should have to admit it it ha not
been driven thenc to thi hour
after i had dress myself i pass into the eat or rather embalm
chamber and had some food which wa as befor brought to me by the
girl mute when i had finish i went and saw poor leo who wa quit
off hi head and did not even know me i ask ustan how she thought
he wa but she onli shook her head and began to cry a littl evid
her hope were small and i then and there made up my mind that if it
were in ani wai possibl i would get she to come and see him sure
she would cure him if she choseat ani rate she said she could while i
wa in the room billali enter and also shook hi head
he will die at night he said
god forbid my father i answer and turn awai with a heavi heart
shewhomustbeobei command thy presenc my baboon said the
old man as soon as we got to the curtain but oh my dear son be more
care yesterdai i made sure in my heart that she would blast thee
when thou didst not crawl upon thy stomach befor her she is sit in
the great hall even now to do justic upon those who would have smitten
thee and the lion come on my son come swiftli
i turn and follow him down the passag and when we reach the
great central cave saw that mani amahagg some robe and some mere
clad in the sweet simplic of a leopard skin were hurri along
it we mingl with the throng and walk up the enorm and inde
almost intermin cave all the wai it wall were elabor
sculptur and everi twenti pace or so passag open out of it at
right angl lead billali told me to tomb hollow in the rock
by the peopl who were befor nobodi visit those tomb now he
said and i must sai that my heart rejoic when i thought of the
opportun of antiquarian research which open out befor me
at last we came to the head of the cave where there wa a rock da
almost exactli similar to the on on which we had been so furious
attack a fact that prove to me that these da must have been us
as altar probabl for the celebr of religi ceremoni and
more especi of rite connect with the inter of the dead on
either side of thi da were passag lead billali inform me to
other cave full of dead bodi inde he ad the whole mountain
is full of dead and nearli all of them ar perfect
in front of the da were gather a great number of peopl of both
sex who stood stare about in their peculiar gloomi fashion which
would have reduc mark taplei himself to miseri in about five minut
on the da wa a rude chair of black wood inlaid with ivori have
a seat made of grass fibr and a footstool form of a wooden slab
attach to the framework of the chair
suddenli there wa a cry of hiya hiya she she and thereupon
the entir crowd of spectat instantli precipit itself upon the
ground and lai still as though it were individu and collect
stricken dead leav me stand there like some solitari survivor of
a massacr as it did so a long string of guard began to defil from a
passag to the left and rang themselv on either side of the da
then follow about a score of male mute then as mani women mute
bear lamp and then a tall white figur swath from head to foot
in whom i recognis she herself she mount the da and sat down
upon the chair and spoke to me in greek i suppos becaus she did
not wish those present to understand what she said
come hither oh holli she said and sit thou at my feet and see me
do justic on those who would have slain thee forgiv me if my greek
doth halt like a lame man it is so long sinc i have heard the sound of
it that my tongu is stiff and will not bend rightli to the word
i bow and mount the da sat down at her feet
how hast thou slept my holli she ask
i slept not well oh ayesha i answer with perfect truth and with
an inward fear that perhap she knew how i had pass the heart of the
night
so she said with a littl laugh i too have not slept well last
night i had dream and methink that thou didst call them to me oh
holli
of what didst thou dream ayesha i ask indiffer
i dream she answer quickli of on i hate and on i love and
then as though to turn the convers she address the captain of
her guard in arab let the men be brought befor me
the captain bow low for the guard and her attend did not
prostrat themselv but had remain stand and depart with hi
underl down a passag to the right
then came a silenc she lean her swath head upon her hand and
appear to be lost in thought while the multitud befor her continu
to grovel upon their stomach onli screw their head round a littl
so as to get a view of us with on ey it seem that their queen
so rare appear in public that thei were will to undergo thi
inconveni and even graver risk to have the opportun of look
on her or rather on her garment for no live man there except myself
had ever seen her face at last we caught sight of the wave of light
and heard the tramp of men come along the passag and in file the
guard and with them the survivor of our wouldb murder to the
number of twenti or more on whose counten a natur express of
sullen struggl with the terror that evid fill their savag
heart thei were rang in front of the da and would have cast
themselv down on the floor of the cave like the spectat but she
stop them
nai she said in her softest voic stand i prai you stand
perchanc the time will soon be when ye shall grow weari of be
stretch out and she laugh melodi
i saw a cring of terror run along the rank of the doom wretch
and wick villain as thei were i felt sorri for them some minut
perhap two or three pass befor anyth fresh occur dure
which she appear from the movement of her headfor of cours
we could not see her eyesto be slowli and carefulli examin each
delinqu at last she spoke address herself to me in a quiet and
deliber tone
dost thou oh my guest recognis these men
ay oh queen nearli all of them i said and i saw them glower at me
as i said it
then tell to me and thi great compani the tale whereof i have
heard
thu adjur i in as few word as i could relat the histori of the
cannib feast and of the attempt tortur of our poor servant the
narr wa receiv in perfect silenc both by the accus and by
the audienc and also by she herself when i had done ayesha call
upon billali by name and lift hi head from the ground but without
rise the old man confirm my stori no further evid wa taken
ye have heard said she at length in a cold clear voic
veri differ from her usual tonesinde it wa on of the most
remark thing about thi extraordinari creatur that her voic had
the power of suit itself in a wonder manner to the mood of the
moment what have ye to sai ye rebelli children why vengeanc
should not be done upon you
for some time there wa no answer but at last on of the men a fine
broadchest fellow well on in middlelif with deepgraven featur
and an ey like a hawk spoke and said that the order that thei had
receiv were not to harm the white men noth wa said of their
black servant so eg on thereto by a woman who wa now dead thei
proceed to try to hotpot him after the ancient and honour custom
of their countri with a view of eat him in due cours as for their
sudden attack upon ourselv it wa made in an access of sudden furi
and thei deepli regret it he end by humbl prai that thei might
be banish into the swamp to live and die as it might chanc but i
saw it written on hi face that he had but littl hope of merci
then came a paus and the most intens silenc reign over the whole
scene which illumin as it wa by the flicker of the lamp strike
out broad pattern of light and shadow upon the rocki wall wa as
strang as ani i ever saw even in that unholi land upon the ground
befor the da were stretch score of the corpselik form of the
spectat till at last the long line of them were lost in the
gloomi background befor thi outstretch audienc were the knot
of evildo try to cover up their natur terror with a brave
appear of unconcern on the right and left stood the silent guard
robe in white and arm with great spear and dagger and men and
women mute watch with hard curiou ey then seat in her
barbar chair abov them all with myself at her feet wa the veil
white woman whose loveli and awesom power seem to visibl shine
about her like a halo or rather like the glow from some unseen light
never have i seen her veil shape look more terribl than it did in
that space while she gather herself up for vengeanc
at last it came
dog and serpent she began in a low voic that gradual gather
power as she went on till the place rang with it eater of human
flesh two thing have ye done first ye have attack these stranger
be white men and would have slain their servant and for that alon
death is your reward but that is not all ye have dare to disobei me
did i not send my word unto you by billali my servant and the father
of your household did i not bid you to hospit entertain these
stranger whom now ye have striven to slai and whom had not thei
been brave and strong beyond the strength of men ye would cruelli have
murder hath it not been taught to you from childhood that the law of
she is an ever fix law and that he who breaketh it by so much as
on jot or tittl shall perish and is not my lightest word a law
have not your father taught you thi i sai whilst as yet ye were but
children do ye not know that as well might ye bid these great cave to
fall upon you or the sun to ceas it journei as to hope to turn
me from my cours or make my word light or heavi accord to your
mind well do ye know it ye wick on but ye ar all evilevil
to the coreth wicked bubbl up in you like a fountain in the
springtim were it not for me gener sinc had ye ceas to be
for of your own evil wai had ye destroi each other and now becaus
ye have done thi thing becaus ye have striven to put these men my
guest to death and yet more becaus ye have dare to disobei my word
thi is the doom that i doom you to that ye be taken to the cave of
tortur and given over to the tormentor and that on the go down
of tomorrow sun those of you who yet remain aliv be slain even as
ye would have slain the servant of thi my guest
the cave of tortur i afterward saw thi dread
place also a legaci from the prehistor peopl who live
in kr the onli object in the cave itself were slab of
rock arrang in variou posit to facilit the
oper of the tortur mani of these slab which were
of a porou stone were stain quit dark with the blood of
ancient victim that had soak into them also in the
centr of the room wa a place for a furnac with a caviti
wherein to heat the histor pot but the most dread
thing about the cave wa that over each slab wa a
sculptur illustr of the appropri tortur be
appli these sculptur were so aw that i will not
harrow the reader by attempt a descript of theml
h h
she ceas and a faint murmur of horror ran round the cave as for the
victim as soon as thei realis the full hideous of their doom
their stoicism forsook them and thei flung themselv down upon the
ground and wept and implor for merci in a wai that wa dread to
behold i too turn to ayesha and beg her to spare them or at
least to mete out their fate in some less aw wai but she wa hard as
adam about it
my holli she said again speak in greek which to tell the truth
although i have alwai been consid a better scholar of the languag
than most men i found it rather difficult to follow chiefli becaus of
the chang in the fall of the accent ayesha of cours talk with
the accent of her contemporari wherea we have onli tradit and the
modern accent to guid us as to the exact pronunci my holli it
cannot be were i to show merci to those wolv your live would not be
safe among thi peopl for a dai thou knowest them not thei ar tiger
to lap blood and even now thei hunger for your live how thinkest
thou that i rule thi peopl i have but a regiment of guard to do my
bid therefor it is not by forc it is by terror my empir is
of the imagin onc in a gener mayhap i do as i have done but
now and slai a score by tortur believ not that i would be cruel or
take vengeanc on anyth so low what can it profit me to be aveng
on such as these those who live long my holli have no passion
save where thei have interest though i mai seem to slai in wrath
or becaus my mood is cross it is not so thou hast seen how in the
heaven the littl cloud blow thi wai and that without a caus yet
behind them is the great wind sweep on it path whither it listeth
so it is with me oh holli my mood and chang ar the littl cloud
and fitfulli these seem to turn but behind them ever blow the great
wind of my purpos nai the men must die and die as i have said
then suddenli turn to the captain of the guard
as my word is so be it
xvi
the tomb of kr
after the prison had been remov ayesha wave her hand and the
spectat turn round and began to crawl off down the cave like a
scatter flock of sheep when thei were a fair distanc from the da
howev thei rose and walk awai leav the queen and myself alon
with the except of the mute and the few remain guard most of
whom had depart with the doom men think thi a good opportun
i ask she to come and see leo tell her of hi seriou condit
but she would not sai that he certainli would not die befor the
night as peopl never di of that sort of fever except at nightfal
or dawn also she said that it would be better to let the sick spend
it cours as much as possibl befor she cure it accordingli i wa
rise to leav when she bade me follow her as she would talk with me
and show me the wonder of the cave
i wa too much involv in the web of her fatal fascin to sai her
no even if i had wish which i did not she rose from her chair and
make some sign to the mute descend from the da thereon four
of the girl took lamp and rang themselv two in front and two
behind us but the other went awai as also did the guard
now she said wouldst thou see some of the wonder of thi place oh
holli look upon thi great cave sawest thou ever the like yet wa it
and mani more like it hollow by the hand of the dead race that onc
live here in the citi on the plain a great and wonder peopl must
thei have been those men of kr but like the egyptian thei thought
more of the dead than of the live how mani men thinkest thou
work for how mani year did it need to the hollow out thi cave
and all the galleri thereof
ten of thousand i answer
so oh holli thi peopl wa an old peopl befor the egyptian
were a littl can i read of their inscript have found the kei
theretoand see thou here thi wa on of the last of the cave that
thei hollow and turn to the rock behind her she motion the
mute to hold up the lamp carven over the da wa the figur of an
old man seat in a chair with an ivori rod in hi hand it struck me
at onc that hi featur were exceedingli like those of the man who wa
repres as be embalm in the chamber where we took our meal
beneath the chair which by the wai wa shape exactli like the on
in which ayesha had sat to give judgment wa a short inscript in the
extraordinari charact of which i have alreadi spoke but which i do
not rememb suffici of to illustr it look more like chines
write than ani other that i am acquaint with thi inscript
ayesha proceed with some difficulti and hesit to read aloud and
translat it ran as follow
in the year four thousand two hundr and fiftynin from the found
of the citi of imperi kr wa thi cave or burial place complet
by tisno king of kr the peopl thereof and their slave have
labour thereat for three gener to be a tomb for their citizen
of rank who shall come after mai the bless of the heaven abov the
heaven rest upon their work and make the sleep of tisno the mighti
monarch the like of whose featur is graven abov a sound and
happi sleep till the dai of awaken and also the sleep of hi
servant and of those of hi race who rise up after him shall yet
lai their head as low
thi phrase is remark as seem to indic a
belief in a futur stateeditor
thou seest oh holli she said thi peopl found the citi of
which the ruin yet cumber the plain yonder four thousand year befor
thi cave wa finish yet when first mine ey beheld it two thousand
year ago wa it even as it is now judg therefor how old must that
citi have been and now follow thou me and i will show thee after what
fashion thi great peopl fell when the time wa come for it to fall
and she led the wai down to the centr of the cave stop at a spot
where a round rock had been let into a kind of larg manhol in the
floor accur fill it just as the iron plate fill the space
in the london pavement down which the coal ar thrown thou seest
she said tell me what is it
nai i know not i answer whereon she cross to the lefthand side
of the cave look toward the entranc and sign to the mute to
hold up the lamp on the wall wa someth paint with a red pigment
in similar charact to those hewn beneath the sculptur of tisno king
of kr thi inscript she proceed to translat to me the pigment
still be fresh enough to show the form of the letter it ran thu
i juni a priest of the great templ of kr write thi upon the
rock of the buryingplac in the year four thousand eight hundr and
three from the found of kr kr is fallen no more shall the
mighti feast in her hall no more shall she rule the world and her
navi go out to commerc with the world kr is fallen and her mighti
work and all the citi of kr and all the harbour that she built
and the canal that she made ar for the wolf and the owl and the wild
swan and the barbarian who come after twenti and five moon ago did
a cloud settl upon kr and the hundr citi of kr and out of the
cloud came a pestil that slew her peopl old and young on
with anoth and spare not on with anoth thei turn black and
diedth young and the old the rich and the poor the man and the
woman the princ and the slave the pestil slew and slew and
ceas not by dai or by night and those who escap from the pestil
were slain of the famin no longer could the bodi of the children of
kr be preserv accord to the ancient rite becaus of the number
of the dead therefor were thei hurl into the great pit beneath
the cave through the hole in the floor of the cave then at last a
remnant of thi the great peopl the light of the whole world went
down to the coast and took ship and sail northward and now am i the
priest juni who write thi the last man left aliv of thi great citi
of men but whether there be ani yet left in the other citi i know
not thi do i write in miseri of heart befor i die becaus kr
the imperi is no more and becaus there ar none to worship in her
templ and all her palac ar empti and her princ and her captain
and her trader and her fair women have pass off the face of the
earth
i gave a sigh of astonishmentth utter desol depict in thi
rude scrawl wa so overpow it wa terribl to think of thi
solitari survivor of a mighti peopl record it fate befor he too
went down into dark what must the old man have felt as in ghastli
terrifi solitud by the light of on lamp feebli illumin a
littl space of gloom he in a few brief line daub the histori of hi
nation death upon the cavern wall what a subject for the moralist or
the painter or inde for ani on who can think
doth it not occur to thee oh holli said ayesha lai her hand upon
my shoulder that those men who sail north mai have been the father
of the first egyptian
nai i know not i said it seem that the world is veri old
old ye it is old inde time after time have nation ay and rich
and strong nation learn in the art been and pass awai and
been forgotten so that no memori of them remain thi is but on of
sever for time eat up the work of man unless inde he dig in
cave like the peopl of kr and then mayhap the sea swallow them or
the earthquak shake them in who know what hath been on the earth or
what shall be there is no new thing under the sun as the wise hebrew
wrote long ago yet were not these peopl utterli destroi as i think
some few remain in the other citi for their citi were mani but
the barbarian from the south or perchanc my peopl the arab
came down upon them and took their women to wife and the race of the
amahagg that is now is a bastard brood of the mighti son of kr and
behold it dwelleth in the tomb with it father bone but i know
not who can know my art cannot pierc so far into the black of
time night a great peopl were thei thei conquer till none were
left to conquer and then thei dwelt at eas within their rocki mountain
wall with their man servant and their maid servant their minstrel
their sculptor and their concubin and trade and quarrel and
at and hunt and slept and made merri till their time came but come
i will show thee the great pit beneath the cave whereof the write
speak never shall thine ey wit such anoth sight
the name of the race amahagg would seem to indic a

accordingli i follow her to a side passag open out of the main
cave then down a great number of step and along an underground shaft
which cannot have been less than sixti feet beneath the surfac of the
rock and wa ventil by curiou bore that ran upward i know not
where suddenli the passag end and she halt and bade the mute
hold up the lamp and as she had prophesi i saw a scene such as
i wa not like to see again we were stand in an enorm pit or
rather on the brink of it for it went down deeperi do not know how
muchthan the level on which we stood and wa edg in with a low wall
of rock so far as i could judg thi pit wa about the size of the
space beneath the dome of st paul in london and when the lamp were
held up i saw that it wa noth but on vast charnelhous be
liter full of thousand of human skeleton which lai pile up in an
enorm gleam pyramid form by the slip down of the bodi
at the apex as fresh on were drop in from abov anyth more
appal than thi jumbl mass of the remain of a depart race i
cannot imagin and what made it even more dread wa that in thi
dry air a consider number of the bodi had simpli becom desicc
with the skin still on them and now fix in everi conceiv
posit stare at us out of the mountain of white bone grotesqu
horribl caricatur of human in my astonish i utter an
ejacul and the echo of my voic ring in the vault space
disturb a skull that had been accur balanc for mani thousand
of year near the apex of the pile down it came with a run bound
along merrili toward us and of cours bring an avalanch of other
bone after it till at last the whole pit rattl with their movement
even as though the skeleton were get up to greet us
come i said i have seen enough these ar the bodi of those who
di of the great sick is it not so i ad as we turn awai
yea the peopl of kr ever embalm their dead as did the egyptian
but their art wa greater than the art of the egyptian for wherea
the egyptian disembowel and drew the brain the peopl of kr
inject fluid into the vein and thu reach everi part but stai
thou shalt see and she halt at haphazard at on of the littl
doorwai open out of the passag along which we were walk and
motion to the mute to light us in we enter into a small chamber
similar to the on in which i had slept at our first stoppingplac
onli instead of on there were two stone bench or bed in it on the
bench lai figur cover with yellow linen on which a fine and
impalp dust had gather in the cours of ag but noth like to
the extent that on would have anticip for in these deephewn cave
there is no materi to turn to dust about the bodi on the stone
shelv and floor of the tomb were mani paint vase but i saw veri
few ornament or weapon in ani of the vault
all the linen that the amahagg wore wa taken from the
tomb which account for it yellow hue it wa well
wash howev and properli rebleach it acquir it
former snowi white and wa the softest and best linen i
ever sawl h h
uplift the cloth oh holli said ayesha but when i put out my hand
to do so i drew it back again it seem like sacrileg and to speak
the truth i wa aw by the dread solemn of the place and of the
presenc befor us then with a littl laugh at my fear she drew
them herself onli to discov other and yet finer cloth ly over the
form upon the stone bench these also she withdrew and then for the
first time for thousand upon thousand of year did live ey look upon
the face of that chilli dead it wa a woman she might have been
thirtyf year of ag or perhap a littl less and had certainli
been beauti even now her calm clearcut featur mark out with
delic eyebrow and long eyelash which threw littl line of the
shadow of the lamplight upon the ivori face were wonderfulli beauti
there robe in white down which her blueblack hair wa stream she
slept her last long sleep and on her arm it face press against her
breast there lai a littl babe so sweet wa the sight although so
aw thati confess it without shamei could scarc withhold my
tear it took me back across the dim gulf of ag to some happi home in
dead imperi kr where thi winsom ladi girt about with beauti had
live and di and dy taken her lastborn with her to the tomb
there thei were befor us mother and babe the white memori of a
forgotten human histori speak more eloqu to the heart than
could ani written record of their live rever i replac the
gravecloth and with a sigh that flower so fair should in the
purpos of the everlast have onli bloom to be gather to the
grave i turn to the bodi on the opposit shelf and gentli unveil
it it wa that of a man in advanc life with a long grizzl beard
and also robe in white probabl the husband of the ladi who after
surviv her mani year came at the last to sleep onc more for good
and all besid her
we left the place and enter other it would be too long to describ
the mani thing i saw in them each on had it occup for the five
hundr and odd year that had elaps between the complet of the
cave and the destruct of the race had evid suffic to fill
these catacomb numberless as thei were and all appear to have been
undisturb sinc the dai when thei were place there i could fill a
book with the descript of them but to do so would onli be to repeat
what i have said with variat
nearli all the bodi so masterfulli wa the art with which thei had
been treat were as perfect as on the dai of death thousand of year
befor noth came to injur them in the deep silenc of the live
rock thei were beyond the reach of heat and cold and damp and the
aromat drug with which thei had been satur were evid
practic everlast in their effect here and there howev we saw
an except and in these case although the flesh look sound enough
extern if on touch it it fell in and reveal the fact that the
figur wa but a pile of dust thi aros ayesha told me from these
particular bodi have either ow to hast in the burial or
other caus been soak in the preserv instead of it be
inject into the substanc of the flesh
ayesha afterward show me the tree from the leav of
which thi ancient preserv wa manufactur it is a
low bushlik tree that to thi dai grow in wonder
plenti upon the side of the mountain or rather upon the
slope lead up to the rocki wall the leav ar long
and narrow a vivid green in colour but turn a bright
red in the autumn and not unlik those of a laurel in
gener appear thei have littl smell when green but
if boil the aromat odour from them is so strong that on
can hardli bear it the best mixtur howev wa made from
the root and among the peopl of kr there wa a law
which ayesha show me allud to on some of the
inscript to the effect that on pain of heavi penalti
no on under a certain rank wa to be embalm with the
drug prepar from the root the object and effect of thi
wa of cours to preserv the tree from extermin
the sale of the leav and root wa a govern monopoli
and from it the king of kr deriv a larg proport of
their privat revenuel h h
about the last tomb we visit i must howev sai on word for it
content spoke even more eloqu to the human sympathi than those
of the first it had but two occup and thei lai togeth on a
singl shelf i withdrew the gravecloth and there clasp heart to
heart were a young man and a bloom girl her head rest on hi arm
and hi lip were press against her brow i open the man linen
robe and there over hi heart wa a daggerwound and beneath the
woman fair breast wa a like cruel stab through which her life had
eb awai on the rock abov wa an inscript in three word ayesha
translat it it wa wed in death
what wa the lifestori of these two who of a truth were beauti in
their live and in their death were not divid
i close my eyelid and imagin take up the thread of thought
shot it swift shuttl back across the ag weav a pictur on their
black so real and vivid in it detail that i could almost for a
moment think that i had triumph oer the past and that my spirit
ey had pierc the mysteri of time
i seem to see thi fair girl formth yellow hair stream down
her glitter against her garment snowi white and the bosom that
wa whiter than the robe even dim with it lustr her ornament
of burnish gold i seem to see the great cave fill with warrior
beard and clad in mail and on the light da where ayesha had
given judgment a man stand robe and surround by the symbol of
hi priestli offic and up the cave there came on clad in purpl and
befor him and behind him came minstrel and fair maiden chant a
wed song white stood the maid against the altar fairer than
the fairest therepur than a lili and more cold than the dew that
glisten in it heart but as the man drew near she shudder then out
of the press and throng there sprang a darkhair youth and put hi
arm about thi longforgotten maid and kiss her pale face in which
the blood shot up like light of the red dawn across the silent sky and
next there wa turmoil and uproar and a flash of sword and thei
tore the youth from her arm and stab him but with a cry she
snatch the dagger from hi belt and drove it into her snowi breast
home to the heart and down she fell and then with cri and wail
and everi sound of lament the pageant roll awai from the arena
of my vision and onc more the past shut to it book
let him who read forgiv the intrus of a dream into a histori of
fact but it came so home to mei saw it all so clear in a moment
as it were and besid who shall sai what proport of fact past
present or to come mai lie in the imagin what is imagin
perhap it is the shadow of the intang truth perhap it is the
soul thought
in an instant the whole thing had pass through my brain and she wa
address me
behold the lot of man said the veil ayesha as she drew the wind
sheet back over the dead lover speak in a solemn thrill voic
which accord well with the dream that i had dream to the tomb and
to the forget that hide the tomb must we all come at last ay
even i who live so long even for me oh holli thousand upon thousand
of year henc thousand of year after you hast gone through the gate
and been lost in the mist a dai will dawn whereon i shall die and be
even as thou art and these ar and then what will it avail that i have
live a littl longer hold off death by the knowledg that i have
wrung from natur sinc at last i too must die what is a span of ten
thousand year or ten time ten thousand year in the histori of time
it is as naughtit is as the mist that roll up in the sunlight it
fleeth awai like an hour of sleep or a breath of the etern spirit
behold the lot of man certainli it shall overtak us and we shall
sleep certainli too we shall awak and live again and again shall
sleep and so on and on through period space and time from on
unto on till the world is dead and the world beyond the world ar
dead and naught liveth but the spirit that is life but for us twain
and for these dead on shall the end of end be life or shall it be
death as yet death is but life night but out of the night is the
morrow born again and doth again beget the night onli when dai and
night and life and death ar end and swallow up in that from which
thei came what shall be our fate oh holli who can see so far not
even i
and then with a sudden chang of tone and manner
hast thou seen enough my stranger guest or shall i show thee more of
the wonder of these tomb that ar my palac hall if thou wilt i can
lead thee to where tisno the mightiest and most valor king of kr
in whose dai these cave were end li in a pomp that seem to mock
at nothing and bid the empti shadow of the past do homag to hi
sculptur vaniti
i have seen enough oh queen i answer my heart is overwhelm
by the power of the present death mortal is weak and easili broken
down by a sens of the companionship that wait upon it end take me

the balanc turn
in a few minut follow the lamp of the mute which held out
from the bodi as a bearer hold water in a vessel had the appear of
float down the dark by themselv we came to a stair which led
us to she anteroom the same that billali had crept up upon on all
four on the previou dai here i would have bid the queen adieu but
she would not
nai she said enter with me oh holli for of a truth thy
convers pleaseth me think oh holli for two thousand year have i
had none to convers with save slave and my own thought and though
of all thi think hath much wisdom come and mani secret been made
plain yet am i weari of my thought and have come to loath mine own
societi for sure the food that memori give to eat is bitter to the
tast and it is onli with the teeth of hope that we can bear to bite
it now though thy thought ar green and tender as becometh on so
young yet ar thei those of a think brain and in truth thou dost
bring back to my mind certain of those old philosoph with whom in
dai bygon i have disput at athen and at becca in arabia for thou
hast the same crab air and dusti look as though thou hadst pass
thy dai in read illwrit greek and been stain dark with the grime
of manuscript so draw the curtain and sit here by my side and we
will eat fruit and talk of pleasant thing see i will again unveil
to thee thou hast brought it on thyself oh holli fairli have i warn
theeand thou shalt call me beauti as even those old philosoph
were wont to do fie upon them forget their philosophi
and without more ado she stood up and shook the white wrap from
her and came forth shine and splendid like some glitter snake when
she ha cast her slough ay and fix her wonder ey upon memor
deadli than ani basilisksand pierc me through and through with
their beauti and sent her light laugh ring through the air like
chime of silver bell
a new mood wa on her and the veri colour of her mind seem to chang
beneath it it wa no longer torturetorn and hate as i had seen
it when she wa curs her dead rival by the leap flame no longer
icili terribl as in the judgmenthal no longer rich and sombr and
splendid like a tyrian cloth as in the dwell of the dead no her
mood now wa that of aphrodit triumph liferadi ecstat
wonderfulseem to flow from her and around her softli she laugh
and sigh and swift her glanc flew she shook her heavi tress
and their perfum fill the place she struck her littl sandal foot
upon the floor and hum a snatch of some old greek epithalamium all
the majesti wa gone or did but lurk and faintli flicker through her
laugh ey like lightn seen through sunlight she had cast off
the terror of the leap flame the cold power of judgment that wa
even now be done and the wise sad of the tombscast them off
and put them behind her like the white shroud she wore and now stood
out the incarn of love tempt womanhood made more perfectand
in a wai more spiritualthan ever woman wa befor
so my holli sit there where thou canst see me it is by thine own
wish rememberagain i sai blame me not if thou dost wear awai thy
littl span with such a sick pain at the heart that thou wouldst fain
have di befor ever thy curiou ey were set upon me there sit so
and tell me for in truth i am inclin for praisestel me am i not
beauti nai speak not so hastili consid well the point take me
featur by featur forget not my form and my hand and feet and
my hair and the white of my skin and then tell me truli hast
thou ever known a woman who in aught ay in on littl portion of
her beauti in the curv of an eyelash even or the model of a
shelllik ear is justifi to hold a light befor my loveli now
my waist perchanc thou thinkest it too larg but of a truth it is not
so it is thi golden snake that is too larg and doth not bind it as
it should it is a wide snake and knoweth that it is ill to tie in
the waist but see give me thy handssonow press them round me and
there with but a littl forc thy finger touch oh holli
i could bear it no longer i am but a man and she wa more than a
woman heaven know what she wasi do not but then and there i
fell upon my knee befor her and told her in a sad mixtur of
languagesfor such moment confus the thoughtsthat i worship her
as never woman wa worship and that i would give my immort soul
to marri her which at that time i certainli would have done and so
inde would ani other man or all the race of men roll into on for
a moment she look surpris and then she began to laugh and clap her
hand in glee
oh so soon oh holli she said i wonder how mani minut it would
need to bring thee to thy knee i have not seen a man kneel befor
me for so mani dai and believ me to a woman heart the sight is
sweet ay wisdom and length of dai take not from that dear pleasur
which is our sex onli right
what wouldst thouwhat wouldst thou thou dost not know what thou
doest have i not told thee that i am not for thee i love but on and
thou art not the man ah holli for all thy wisdomand in a wai thou
art wiseth art but a fool run after folli thou wouldst look
into mine eyesth wouldst kiss me well if it pleaseth thee
look and she bent herself toward me and fix her dark and
thrill orb upon my own ay and kiss too if thou wilt for
thank be given to the scheme of thing kiss leav no mark except
upon the heart but if thou dost kiss i tell thee of a sureti wilt thou
eat out thy breast with love of me and die and she bent yet further
toward me till her soft hair brush my brow and her fragrant breath
plai upon my face and made me faint and weak then of a sudden even
as i stretch out my hand to clasp she straighten herself and a
quick chang pass over her reach out her hand she held it over my
head and it seem to me that someth flow from it that chill
me back to common sens and a knowledg of proprieti and the domest
virtu
enough of thi wanton folli she said with a touch of stern
listen holli thou art a good and honest man and i fain would spare
thee but oh it is so hard for woman to be merci i have said i am
not for thee therefor let thy thought pass by me like an idl wind
and the dust of thy imagin sink again into the depthswel of
despair if thou wilt thou dost not know me holli hadst thou seen me
but ten hour past when my passion seiz me thou hadst shrunk from me
in fear and trembl i am of mani mood and like the water in that
vessel i reflect mani thing but thei pass my holli thei pass and
ar forgotten onli the water is the water still and i still am i and
that which maketh the water maketh it and that which maketh me maketh
me nor can my qualiti be alter therefor pai no heed to what i
seem see that thou canst not know what i am if thou troublest me
again i will veil myself and thou shalt behold my face no more
i rose and sank on the cushion couch besid her yet quiver with
emot though for a moment my mad passion had left me as the leav
of a tree quiver still although the gust be gone that stir them i
did not dare to tell her that i had seen her in that deep and hellish
mood mutter incant to the fire in the tomb
so she went on now eat some fruit believ me it is the onli true
food for man oh tell me of the philosophi of that hebrew messiah who
came after me and who thou sayest doth now rule rome and greec and
egypt and the barbarian beyond it must have been a strang philosophi
that he taught for in my dai the peopl would have naught of our
philosophi revel and lust and drink blood and cold steel and the
shock of men gather in the battlethes were the canon of their
creed
i had recov myself a littl by now and feel bitterli asham of
the weak into which i had been betrai i did my best to expound
to her the doctrin of christian to which howev with the singl
except of our concept of heaven and hell i found that she paid
but scant attent her interest be all direct toward the man
who taught them also i told her that among her own peopl the arab
anoth prophet on moham had arisen and preach a new faith to
which mani million of mankind now adher
ah she said i seetwo new religion i have known so mani and
doubtless there have been mani more sinc i knew aught beyond these
cave of kr mankind ask ever of the ski to vision out what
li behind them it is terror for the end and but a subtler form of
selfishnessthi it is that breed religion mark my holli each
religion claim the futur for it follow or at least the good
thereof the evil is for those benight on who will have none of
it see the light the true believ worship as the fish see the
star but dimli the religion come and the religion pass and the
civilis come and pass and naught endur but the world and human
natur ah if man would but see that hope is from within and not from
withoutthat he himself must work out hi own salvat he is there
and within him is the breath of life and a knowledg of good and evil as
good and evil is to him thereon let him build and stand erect and not
cast himself befor the imag of some unknown god model like hi
poor self but with a bigger brain to think the evil thing and a longer
arm to do it
i thought to myself which show how old such reason is be
inde on of the recur qualiti of theolog discuss that
her argument sound veri like some that i have heard in the nineteenth
centuri and in other place than the cave of kr and with which by
the wai i total disagre but i did not care to try and discuss the
question with her to begin with my mind wa too weari with all the
emot through which i had pass and in the second place i knew
that i should get the worst of it it is weari work enough to argu
with an ordinari materialist who hurl statist and whole strata
of geolog fact at your head whilst you can onli buffet him with
deduct and instinct and the snowflak of faith that ar ala so
apt to melt in the hot ember of our troubl how littl chanc then
should i have against on whose brain wa supernatur sharpen
and who had two thousand year of experi besid all manner of
knowledg of the secret of natur at her command feel that she
would be more like to convert me than i should to convert her i
thought it best to leav the matter alon and so sat silent mani a
time sinc then have i bitterli regret that i did so for therebi i
lost the onli opportun i can rememb have had of ascertain what
ayesha realli believ and what her philosophi wa
well my holli she continu and so those peopl of mine have found
a prophet a fals prophet thou sayest for he is not thine own and
inde i doubt it not yet in my dai wa it otherwis for then we
arab had mani god allt there wa and saba the host of heaven al
uzza and manah the stoni on for whom the blood of victim flow
and wadd and saw and yaghth the lion of the dweller in yaman and
yk the hors of morad and nasr the eagl of hamyar ay and mani
more oh the folli of it all the shame and the piti folli yet when
i rose in wisdom and spoke thereof sure thei would have slain me in
the name of their outrag god well so hath it ever beenbut my
holli art thou weari of me alreadi that thou dost sit so silent or
dost thou fear lest i should teach thee my philosophyfor know i have
a philosophi what would a teacher be without her own philosophi and
if thou dost vex me overmuch bewar for i will have thee learn it and
thou shalt be my discipl and we twain will found a faith that shall
swallow up all other faithless man and but half an hour sinc thou
wast upon thy kneesth postur doe not suit thee hollyswear
that thou didst love me what shall we donai i have it i will come
and see thi youth the lion as the old man billali call him who came
with thee and who is so sick the fever must have run it cours by
now and if he is about to die i will recov him fear not my holli i
shall us no magic have i not told thee that there is no such thing as
magic though there is such a thing as understand and appli the
forc which ar in natur go now and present when i have made the
drug readi i will follow thee
ayesha wa a great chemist inde chemistri appear to
have been her onli amus and occup she had on of
the cave fit up as a laboratori and although her
applianc were necessarili rude the result that she
attain were as will becom clear in the cours of thi
narr suffici surprisingl h h
accordingli i went onli to find job and ustan in a great state of
grief declar that leo wa in the throe of death and that thei had
been search for me everywher i rush to the couch and glanc at

hi lip were quiver and everi now and again a littl shudder ran
down hi frame i knew enough of doctor to see that in anoth hour
he would be beyond the reach of earthli helpperhap in anoth five
minut how i curs my selfish and the folli that had kept me
linger by ayesha side while my dear boi lai dy ala and ala
how easili the best of us ar light down to evil by the gleam of
a woman ey what a wick wretch wa i actual for the last
halfhour i had scarc thought of leo and thi be it rememb
of the man who for twenti year had been my dearest companion and the
chief interest of my exist and now perhap it wa too late

am sorri i cannot name hi distress by ani more delic wordaud
in the corner see my ey fix upon him he went outsid to give wai
to hi grief in the passag obvious the onli hope lai in ayesha she
and she aloneunless inde she wa an impost which i could
not believecould save him i would go and implor her to come as
i start to do so howev job came fly into the room hi hair
liter stand on end with terror
oh god help us sir he ejacul in a frighten whisper here a
corps acom slide down the passag
for a moment i wa puzzl but present of cours it struck me that
he must have seen ayesha wrap in her gravelik garment and been
deceiv by the extraordinari undul smooth of her walk into a
belief that she wa a white ghost glide toward him inde at that
veri moment the question wa settl for ayesha herself wa in the
apart or rather cave job turn and saw her sheet form and
then with a convuls howl of here it come sprang into a corner
and jam hi face against the wall and ustan guess whose the
dread presenc must be prostrat herself upon her face
thou comest in a good time ayesha i said for my boi li at the
point of death
so she said softli provid he be not dead it is no matter for i
can bring him back to life my holli is that man there thy servant

she laugh
and the girl ah i see now it is she of whom thou didst speak to me
well bid them both to leav us and we will see to thi sick lion of
thine i love not that underl should perceiv my wisdom
thereon i told ustan in arab and job in english both to leav the
room an order which the latter obei readili enough and wa glad to
obei for he could not in ani wai subdu hi fear but it wa otherwis
with ustan
what doe she want she whisper divid between her fear of the
terribl queen and her anxieti to remain near leo it is sure the
right of a wife to be near her husband when he dieth nai i will not
go my lord the baboon
why doth not that woman leav us my holli ask ayesha from the
other end of the cave where she wa engag in carelessli examin
some of the sculptur on the wall
she is not will to leav leo i answer not know what to sai
ayesha wheel round and point to the girl ustan said on word
and on onli but it wa quit enough for the tone in which it wa said
meant volum
go
and then ustan crept past her on her hand and knee and went
thou seest my holli said ayesha with a littl laugh it wa
need that i should give these peopl a lesson in obedi that girl
went nigh to disobei me but then she did not learn thi morn how
i treat the disobedi well she ha gone and now let me see the
youth and she glide toward the couch on which leo lai with hi face
in the shadow and turn toward the wall
he hath a nobl shape she said as she bent over him to look upon hi
face
next second her tall and willowi form wa stagger back across the
room as though she had been shot or stab stagger back till at
last she struck the cavern wall and then there burst from her lip the
most aw and unearthli scream that i ever heard in all my life
what is it ayesha i cri is he dead
she turn and sprang toward me like a tigress
thou dog she said in her terribl whisper which sound like the
hiss of a snake why didst thou hide thi from me and she stretch
out her arm and i thought that she wa about to slai me
what i ejacul in the most live terror what
ah she said perchanc thou didst not know learn my holli learn
there liesther li my lost kallikr kallikr who ha come
back to me at last as i knew he would as i knew he would and she
began to sob and to laugh and gener to conduct herself like ani
other ladi who is a littl upset murmur kallikr kallikr
nonsens thought i to myself but i did not like to sai it and
inde at that moment i wa think of leo life have forgotten
everyth els in that terribl anxieti what i fear now wa that he
should die while she wa carri on
unless thou art abl to help him ayesha i put in by wai of a
remind thy kallikr will soon be far beyond thy call sure
he dieth even now
true she said with a start oh why did i not come befor i am
unnervedmi hand trembl even mineand yet it is veri easi here
thou holli take thi phial and she produc a tini jar of potteri
from the fold of her garment and pour the liquid in it down hi
throat it will cure him if he be not dead swift now swift the man
di
i glanc toward him it wa true enough leo wa in hi
deathstruggl i saw hi poor face turn ashen and heard the breath
begin to rattl in hi throat the phial wa stopper with a littl
piec of wood i drew it with my teeth and a drop of the fluid within
flew out upon my tongu it had a sweet flavour and for a second made
my head swim and a mist gather befor my ey but happili the effect
pass awai as swiftli as it had arisen
when i reach leo side he wa plainli expiringhi golden head wa
slowli turn from side to side and hi mouth wa slightli open i
call to ayesha to hold hi head and thi she manag to do though
the woman wa quiver from head to foot like an aspenleaf or a
startl hors then forc the jaw a littl more open i pour the
content of the phial into hi mouth instantli a littl vapour aros
from it as happen when on disturb nitric acid and thi sight did
not increas my hope alreadi faint enough of the efficaci of the
treatment
on thing howev wa certain the death throe ceasedat first i
thought becaus he had got beyond them and cross the aw river
hi face turn to a livid pallor and hi heartbeat which had been
feebl enough befor seem to die awai altogetheronli the eyelid
still twitch a littl in my doubt i look up at ayesha whose
headwrap had slip back in her excit when she went reel
across the room she wa still hold leo head and with a face as
pale as hi own watch hi counten with such an express of
agonis anxieti as i had never seen befor clearli she did not know if
he would live or die five minut slowli pass and i saw that she wa
abandon hope her love oval face seem to fall in and grow visibl
thinner beneath the pressur of a mental agoni whose pencil drew black
line about the hollow of her ey the coral fade even from her lip
till thei were as white as leo face and quiver pitifulli it wa
shock to see her even in my own grief i felt for her
is it too late i gasp
she hid her face in her hand and made no answer and i too turn
awai but as i did so i heard a deepdrawn breath and look down
perceiv a line of colour creep up leo face then anoth and
anoth and then wonder of wonder the man we had thought dead turn
over on hi side

seest after all i am a veri woman thinknow think of it thi morn
didst thou speak of the place of torment appoint by thi new religion
of thine hell or hade thou didst call ita place where the vital
essenc live and retain an individu memori and where all the error
and fault of judgment and unsatisfi passion and the unsubstanti
terror of the mind wherewith it hath at ani time had to do come to
mock and haunt and gibe and wring the heart for ever and for ever with
the vision of it own hopeless thu even thu have i live for
full two thousand yearsfor some six and sixti gener as ye
reckon timein a hell as thou callest ittor by the memori of
a crime tortur dai and night with an unfulfil desirewithout
companionship without comfort without death and led on onli down my
dreari road by the marsh light of hope which though thei flicker
here and there and now glow strong and now were not yet as my
skill told me would on dai lead unto my deliver
and thenthink of it still oh holli for never shalt thou hear such
anoth tale or see such anoth scene nai not even if i give thee
ten thousand year of lifeand thou shalt have it in payment if thou
wiltthink at last my deliver cameh for whom i had watch and
wait through the generationsat the appoint time he came to seek
me as i knew that he must come for my wisdom could not err though
i knew not when or how yet see how ignor i wa see how small my
knowledg and how faint my strength for hour he lai there sick unto
death and i felt it noti who had wait for him for two thousand
yearsi knew it not and then at last i see him and behold my chanc

veri jaw of death whenc no power of mine can draw him and if he die
sure must the hell be live through onc moreonc more must i face
the weari centuri and wait and wait till the time in it ful
shall bring my belov back to me and then thou gavest him the
medicin and that five minut drag long befor i knew if he would
live or die and i tell thee that all the sixti gener that ar
gone were not so long as that five minut but thei pass at length
and still he show no sign and i knew that if the drug work not then
so far as i have had knowledg it work not at all then thought i that
he wa onc more dead and all the tortur of all the year gather
themselv into a singl venom spear and pierc me through and
through becaus again i had lost kallikr and then when all wa
done behold he sigh behold he live and i knew that he would
live for none die on whom the drug take hold think of it now my

go woman
then follow a silenc of a minut or so dure which she appear
if on might judg from the almost angel raptur of her facefor she
look angel sometimesto be plung into a happi ecstasi suddenli
howev a new thought struck her and her express becam the veri
revers of angel
almost had i forgotten she said that woman ustan what is she
to kallikrateshi servant or and she paus and her voic
trembl
i shrug my shoulder i understand that she is wed to him accord
to the custom of the amahagg i answer but i know not
her face grew dark as a thundercloud old as she wa ayesha had not
outliv jealousi
then there is an end she said she must die even now
for what crime i ask horrifi she is guilti of naught that thou
art not guilti of thyself oh ayesha she love the man and he ha been
pleas to accept her love where then is her sin
truli oh holli thou art foolish she answer almost petulantli
where is her sin her sin is that she stand between me and my desir
well i know that i can take him from herfor dwell there a man upon
thi earth oh holli who could resist me if i put out my strength
men ar faith for so long onli as temptat pass them by if the
temptat be but strong enough then will the man yield for everi man
like everi rope hath hi break strain and passion is to men what
gold and power ar to womenth weight upon their weak believ me
ill will it go with mortal woman in that heaven of which thou speakest
if onli the spirit be more fair for their lord will never turn to
look upon them and their heaven will becom their hell for man can be
bought with woman beauti if it be but beauti enough and woman
beauti can be ever bought with gold if onli there be gold enough so
wa it in my dai and so it will be to the end of time the world is a
great mart my holli where all thing ar for sale to whom who bid the
highest in the currenc of our desir
these remark which were as cynic as might have been expect from
a woman of ayesha ag and experi jar upon me and i answer
testili that in our heaven there wa no marriag or give in marriag
els would it not be heaven dost thou mean she put in fie on thee
holli to think so ill of us poor women is it then marriag that
mark the line between thy heaven and thy hell but enough of thi thi
is no time for disput and the challeng of our wit why dost thou
alwai disput art thou also a philosoph of these latter dai as
for thi woman she must die for though i can take her lover from her
yet while she live might he think tenderli of her and that i cannot
awai with no other woman shall dwell in my lord thought my empir
shall be all my own she hath had her dai let her be content for
better is an hour with love than a centuri of lonelinessnow the night
shall swallow her
nai nai i cri it would be a wick crime and from a crime
naught come but what is evil for thine own sake do not thi deed
is it then a crime oh foolish man to put awai that which stand
between us and our end then is our life on long crime my holli
sinc dai by dai we destroi that we mai live sinc in thi world none
save the strongest can endur those who ar weak must perish the earth
is to the strong and the fruit thereof for everi tree that grow a
score shall wither that the strong on mai take their share we run to
place and power over the dead bodi of those who fail and fall ay we
win the food we eat from out of the mouth of starv babe it is
the scheme of thing thou sayest too that a crime breed evil but
therein thou dost lack experi for out of crime come mani good
thing and out of good grow much evil the cruel rage of the tyrant
mai prove a bless to the thousand who come after him and the
sweethearted of a holi man mai make a nation slave man doeth thi
and doeth that from the good or evil of hi heart but he knoweth not
to what end hi moral sens doth prompt him for when he striketh he is
blind to where the blow shall fall nor can he count the airi thread
that weav the web of circumst good and evil love and hate night
and dai sweet and bitter man and woman heaven abov and the earth
beneathal these thing ar necessari on to the other and who know
the end of each i tell thee that there is a hand of fate that twine
them up to bear the burden of it purpos and all thing ar gather
in that great rope to which all thing ar need therefor doth it
not becom us to sai thi thing is evil and thi good or the dark is
hate and the light love for to other ey than our the evil mai
be the good and the dark more beauti than the dai or all alik
be fair hearest thou my holli
i felt it wa hopeless to argu against casuistri of thi natur which
if it were carri to it logic conclus would absolut destroi
all moral as we understand it but her talk gave me a fresh thrill
of fear for what mai not be possibl to a be who unconstrain by
human law is also absolut unshackl by a moral sens of right and
wrong which howev partial and convent it mai be is yet
base as our conscienc tell us upon the great wall of individu
respons that mark off mankind from the beast
but i wa deepli anxiou to save ustan whom i like and respect
from the dire fate that overshadow her at the hand of her mighti
rival so i made on more appeal
ayesha i said thou art too subtl for me but thou thyself hast
told me that each man should be a law unto himself and follow the
teach of hi heart hath thy heart no merci toward her whose place
thou wouldst take bethink theea thou sayestthough to me the thing
is incredibleh whom thou desirest ha return to thee after mani
ag and but now thou hast as thou sayest also wrung him from the
jaw of death wilt thou celebr hi come by the murder of on who
love him and whom perchanc he lovedon at the least who save
hi life for thee when the spear of thy slave would have made an end
thereof thou sayest also that in past dai thou didst grievous wrong
thi man that with thine own hand thou didst slai him becaus of the
egyptian amenarta whom he love
how knowest thou that oh stranger how knowest thou that name i spoke
it not to thee she broke in with a cry catch at my arm
perchanc i dream it i answer strang dream do hover about
these cave of kr it seem that the dream wa inde a shadow of
the truth what came to thee of thy mad crimetwo thousand year of
wait wa it not and now wouldst thou repeat the histori sai what
thou wilt i tell thee that evil will come of it for to him who doeth
at the least good breed good and evil evil even though in after dai
out of evil cometh good offenc must need come but woe to him by
whom the offenc cometh so said that messiah of whom i spoke to thee
and it wa truli said if thou slayest thi innoc woman i sai unto
thee that thou shalt be accurs and pluck no fruit from thine ancient
tree of love also what thinkest thou how will thi man take thee
redhand from the slaughter of her who love and tend him
as to that she answer i have alreadi answer thee had i slain
thee as well as her yet should he love me holli becaus he could not
save himself from therefrom ani more than thou couldst save thyself from
dy if by chanc i slew thee oh holli and yet mayb there is truth
in what thou dost sai for in some wai it presseth on my mind if it
mai be i will spare thi woman for have i not told thee that i am not
cruel for the sake of cruelti i love not to see suffer or to caus
it let her come befor mequick now befor my mood chang and she
hastili cover her face with it gauzi wrap
well pleas to have succeed even to thi extent i pass out into
the passag and call to ustan whose white garment i caught sight of
some yard awai huddl up against on of the earthenwar lamp that
were place at interv along the tunnel she rose and ran toward me
is my lord dead oh sai not he is dead she cri lift her
noblelook face all stain as it wa with tear up to me with an
air of infinit beseech that went straight to my heart
nai he live i answer she hath save him enter
she sigh deepli enter and fell upon her hand and knee after the
custom of the amahagg peopl in the presenc of the dread she
stand said ayesha in her coldest voic and come hither
ustan obei stand befor her with bow head
then came a paus which ayesha broke
who is thi man she said point to the sleep form of leo
the man is my husband she answer in a low voic
who gave him to thee for a husband
i took him accord to the custom of our countri oh she
thou hast done evil woman in take thi man who is a stranger he
is not a man of thine own race and the custom fail listen perchanc
thou didst thi thing through ignor therefor woman do i spare
thee otherwis hadst thou di listen again go from henc back to
thine own place and never dare to speak to or set thine ey upon thi
man again he is not for thee listen a third time if thou breakest
thi my law that moment thou diest go
but ustan did not move

then she look up and i saw that her face wa torn with passion
nai oh she i will not go she answer in a choke voic the
man is my husband and i love himi love him and i will not leav him
what right hast thou to command me to leav my husband
i saw a littl quiver pass down ayesha frame and shudder myself
fear the worst
be piti i said in latin it is but natur work

been piti she had been dead even now then address ustan
woman i sai to thee go befor i destroi thee where thou art

and i save hi life destroi me then if thou hast the power i will
not give thee my husbandnevernev
ayesha made a movement so swift that i could scarc follow it but it
seem to me that she lightli struck the poor girl upon the head with
her hand i look at ustan and then stagger back in horror for
there upon her hair right across her bronzelik tress were three
fingermark white as snow as for the girl herself she had put her
hand to her head and wa look daze
great heaven i said perfectli aghast at thi dread manifest
of human power but she did but laugh a littl
thou thinkest poor ignor fool she said to the bewild woman
that i have not the power to slai stai there li a mirror and she
point to leo round shavingglass that had been arrang by job with
other thing upon hi portmanteau give it to thi woman my holli and
let her see that which li across her hair and whether or no i have
power to slai
i pick up the glass and held it befor ustan ey she gaze then
felt at her hair then gaze again and then sank upon the ground with a
sort of sob
now wilt thou go or must i strike a second time ask ayesha in
mockeri look i have set my seal upon thee so that i mai know thee
till thy hair is all as white as it if i see thy face again be sure
too that thy bone shall soon be whiter than my mark upon thy hair
utterli aw and broken down the poor creatur rose and mark with
that aw mark crept from the room sob bitterli
look not so fright my holli said ayesha when she had gone i
tell thee i deal not in magicther is no such thing ti onli a forc
that thou dost not understand i mark her to strike terror to her
heart els must i have slain her and now i will bid my servant to
bear my lord kallikr to a chamber near mine own that i mai watch
over him and be readi to greet him when he wake and thither too
shalt thou come my holli and the white man thy servant but on thing
rememb at thy peril naught shalt thou sai to kallikr as to how
thi woman went and as littl as mai be of me now i have warn
thee and she slid awai to give her order leav me more absolut
confound than ever inde so bewild wa i and rack and torn
with such a success of variou emot that i began to think that
i must be go mad howev perhap fortun i had but littl time
to reflect for present the mute arriv to carri the sleep leo
and our possess across the central cave so for a while all wa
bustl our new room were situat immedi behind what we us to
call ayesha boudoirth curtain space where i had first seen her
where she herself slept i did not then know but it wa somewher quit
close
that night i pass in leo room but he slept through it like the
dead never onc stir i also slept fairli well as inde i
need to do but my sleep wa full of dream of all the horror
and wonder i had undergon chiefli howev i wa haunt by that
fright piec of diableri by which ayesha left her fingermark
upon her rival hair there wa someth so terribl about her swift
snakelik movement and the instantan blanch of that threefold
line that if the result to ustan had been much more tremend i
doubt if thei would have impress me so deepli to thi dai i often
dream of that aw scene and see the weep woman bereav and
mark like cain cast a last look at her lover and creep from the
presenc of her dread queen
anoth dream that troubl me origin in the huge pyramid of bone
i dream that thei all stood up and march past me in thousand
and ten of thousandsin squadron compani and armieswith the
sunlight shine through their hollow rib on thei rush across the
plain to kr their imperi home i saw the drawbridg fall befor
them and heard their bone clank through the brazen gate on thei
went up the splendid street on past fountain palac and templ
such as the ey of man never saw but there wa no man to greet them in
the marketplac and no woman face appear at the windowsonli
a bodiless voic went befor them call fallen is imperi
krfallenfallen fallen on right through the citi march
those gleam phalanx and the rattl of their boni tread echo
through the silent air as thei press grimli on thei pass through
the citi and clomb the wall and march along the great roadwai that
wa made upon the wall till at length thei onc more reach the
drawbridg then as the sun wa sink thei return again toward
their sepulchr and luridli hi light shone in the socket of their
empti ey throw gigant shadow of their bone that stretch
awai and crept and crept like huge spider leg as their armi wound
across the plain then thei came to the cave and onc more on by on
flung themselv in unend file through the hole into the pit of
bone and i awok shudder to see she who had evid been
stand between my couch and leo glide like a shadow from the room
after thi i slept again soundli thi time till morn when i
awok much refresh and got up at last the hour drew near at which
accord to ayesha leo wa to awak and with it came she herself
as usual veil
thou shalt see oh holli she said present shall he awak in hi
right mind the fever have left him
hardli were the word out of her mouth when leo turn round and
stretch out hi arm yawn open hi ey and perceiv a
femal form bend over him threw hi arm round her and kiss her
mistak her perhap for ustan at ani rate he said in arab
hullo ustan why have you ti your head up like that have you got
the toothach and then in english i sai im awfulli hungri why
job you old son of a gun where the deuc have we got to noweh
i am sure i wish i knew mr leo said job edg suspici past
ayesha whom he still regard with the utmost disgust and horror be
by no mean sure that she wa not an anim corps but you mustnt
talk mr leo youv been veri ill and given us a great deal of
hanxieti and if thi ladi look at ayesha would be so kind as to
move ill bring you your soup
thi turn leo attent to the ladi who wa stand by in
perfect silenc hullo he said that is not ustanewher is
ustan
then for the first time ayesha spoke to him and her first word were
a lie she ha gone from henc upon a visit she said and behold
in her place am i here as thine handmaiden
ayesha silver note seem to puzzl leo halfawaken intellect
as also did her corpselik wrap howev he said noth at the
time but drank off hi soup greedili enough and then turn over and
slept again till the even when he woke for the second time he saw
me and began to question me as to what had happen but i had to
put him off as best i could till the morrow when he awok almost
miracul better then i told him someth of hi ill and of my
do but as ayesha wa present i could not tell him much except that
she wa the queen of the countri and well dispos toward us and
that it wa her pleasur to go veil for though of cours i spoke in
english i wa afraid that she might understand what we were sai from
the express of our face and besid i rememb her warn
on the follow dai leo got up almost entir recov the flesh
wound in hi side wa heal and hi constitut natur a vigor
on had shaken off the exhaust consequ on hi terribl fever with
a rapid that i can onli attribut to the effect of the wonder
drug which ayesha had given to him and also to the fact that hi
ill had been too short to reduc him veri much with hi return
health came back full recollect of all hi adventur up to the time
when he had lost conscious in the marsh and of cours of ustan
also to whom i had discov he had grown consider attach
inde he overwhelm me with question about the poor girl which i
did not dare to answer for after leo first awaken she had sent
for me and again warn me solemnli that i wa to reveal noth of the
stori to him delic hint that if i did it would be the wors for
me she also for the second time caution me not to tell leo anyth
more than i wa oblig about herself sai that she would reveal
herself to him in her own time
inde her whole manner chang after all that i had seen i had
expect that she would take the earliest opportun of claim the
man she believ to be her oldworld lover but thi for some reason of
her own which wa at the time quit inscrut to me she did not do
all that she did wa to attend to hi want quietli and with a humil
which wa in strike contrast with her former imperi bear
address him alwai in a tone of someth veri like respect and
keep him with her as much as possibl of cours hi curios wa as
much excit about thi mysteri woman as my own had been and he wa
particularli anxiou to see her face which i had without enter
into particular told him wa as love as her form and voic thi
in itself wa enough to rais the expect of ani young man to a
danger pitch and had it not been that he had not as yet complet
shaken off the effect of ill and wa much troubl in hi mind
about ustan of whose affect and brave devot he spoke in touch
term i have no doubt that he would have enter into her plan and
fallen in love with her by anticip as it wa howev he wa
simpli wildli curiou and also like myself consider aw for
though no hint had been given to him by ayesha of her extraordinari ag
he not unnatur came to identifi her with the woman spoken of on
the potsherd at last quit driven into a corner by hi continu
question which he shower on me while he wa dress on thi third
morn i refer him to ayesha sai with perfect truth that i
did not know where ustan wa accordingli after leo had eaten a hearti
breakfast we adjourn into she presenc for her mute had order
to admit us at all hour
she wa as usual seat in what for want of a better term we call
her boudoir and on the curtain be drawn she rose from her couch
and stretch out both hand came forward to greet us or rather
leo for i as mai be imagin wa now quit left in the cold it wa
a pretti sight to see her veil form glide toward the sturdi young
englishman dress in hi grei flannel suit for though he is half a
greek in blood leo is with the except of hi hair on of the most
englishlook men i ever saw he ha noth of the subtl form or
slipperi manner of the modern greek about him though i presum that
he got hi remark person beauti from hi foreign mother whose
portrait he resembl not a littl he is veri tall and bigchest and
yet not awkward as so mani big men ar and hi head is set upon him in
such a fashion as to give him a proud and vigor air which wa well
translat in hi amahagg name of the lion
greet to thee my young stranger lord she said in her softest
voic right glad am i to see thee upon thy feet believ me had i not
save thee at the last never wouldst thou have stood upon those feet
again but the danger is done and it shall be my careand she flung a
world of mean into the wordsthat it doth return no more
leo bow to her and then in hi best arab thank her for all her
kind and courtesi in care for on unknown to her
nai she answer softli ill could the world spare such a man
beauti is too rare upon it give me no thank who am made happi by thy
come
humph old fellow said leo asid to me in english the ladi is veri
civil we seem to have tumbl into clover i hope that you have made
the most of your opportun by jove what a pair of arm she ha
got
i nudg him in the rib to make him keep quiet for i caught sight of a
gleam from ayesha veil ey which were regard me curious
i trust went on ayesha that my servant have attend well upon
thee if there can be comfort in thi poor place be sure it wait on
thee is there aught that i can do for thee more
ye oh she answer leo hastili i would fain know whither the
young ladi who wa look after me ha gone to
ah said ayesha the girly i saw her nai i know not she
said that she would go i know not whither perchanc she will return
perchanc not it is wearisom wait on the sick and these savag
women ar fickl
leo look both sulki and distress at thi intellig
it veri odd he said to me in english and then address she
i cannot understand he said the young ladi and iwellin short
we had a regard for each other
ayesha laugh a littl veri music and then turn the subject
xix
give me a black goat
the convers after thi wa of such a desultori order that i do not
quit recollect it for some reason perhap from a desir to keep her
ident and charact in reserv ayesha did not talk freeli as she
usual did present howev she inform leo that she had arrang
a danc that night for our amus i wa astonish to hear thi as
i fanci that the amahagg were much too gloomi a folk to indulg
in ani such frivol but as will present more clearli appear
it turn out that an amahagg danc ha littl in common with such
fantast festiv in other countri savag or civilis then as
we were about to withdraw she suggest that leo might like to see
some of the wonder of the cave and as he gladli assent thither we
depart accompani by job and billali to describ our visit would
onli be to repeat a great deal of what i have alreadi said the tomb
we enter were inde differ for the whole rock wa a honeycomb of
sepulchr but the content were nearli alwai similar afterward
we visit the pyramid of bone that had haunt my dream on the
previou night and from thenc went down a long passag to on of the
great vault occupi by the bodi of the poorer citizen of imperi
kr these bodi were not nearli so well preserv as were those of
the wealthier class mani of them had no linen cover on them also
thei were buri from five hundr to on thousand in a singl larg
vault the corps in some instanc be thickli pile on upon
anoth like a heap of slain
for a long while it puzzl me to know what could have
been done with the enorm quantiti of rock that must
have been dug out of these vast cave but i afterward
discov that it wa for the most part built into the
wall and palac of kr and also us to line the
reservoir and sewersl h h
leo wa of cours intens interest in thi stupend and unequal
sight which wa inde enough to awak all the imagin a man
had in him into the most activ life but to poor job it did not
prove attract hi nervesalreadi serious shaken by what he had
undergon sinc we had arriv in thi terribl countrywer as mai
be imagin still further disturb by the spectacl of these mass of
depart human whereof the form still remain perfect befor hi
ey though their voic were for ever lost in the etern silenc of
the tomb nor wa he comfort when old billali by wai of sooth
hi evid agit inform him that he should not be frighten of
these dead thing as he would soon be like them himself
there a nice thing to sai of a man sir he ejacul when i
translat thi littl remark but there what can on expect of an old
maneat savag not but what i dare sai he right and job sigh
when we had finish inspect the cave we return and had our
meal for it wa now past four in the afternoon and we allespeci
leoneed some food and rest at six oclock we togeth with job
wait on ayesha who set to work to terrifi our poor servant still
further by show him pictur on the pool of water in the fontlik
vessel she learnt from me that he wa on of seventeen children and
then bid him think of all hi brother and sister or as mani of them
as he could gather togeth in hi father cottag then she told
him to look in the water and there reflect from it stilli surfac
wa that dead scene of mani year gone by as it wa recal to our
retain brain some of the face were clear enough but some were
mere blur and splotch or with on featur grossli exagger the
fact be that in these instanc job had been unabl to recal
the exact appear of the individu or rememb them onli by a
peculiar of hi tribe and the water could onli reflect what he saw
with hi mind ey for it must be rememb that she power in
thi matter wa strictli limit she could appar except in veri
rare instanc onli photograph upon the water what wa actual in the
mind of some on present and then onli by hi will but if she wa
person acquaint with a local she could as in the case of
ourselv and the whaleboat throw it reflect upon the water and
also it seem the reflect of anyth extran that wa pass
there at the time thi power howev did not extend to the mind
of other for instanc she could show me the interior of my colleg
chapel as i rememb it but not as it wa at the moment of
reflect for where other peopl were concern her art wa strictli
limit to the fact or memori present to their conscious at the
moment so much wa thi so that when we tri for her amus to
show her pictur of note build such as st paul or the hous
of parliament the result wa most imperfect for of cours though we
had a good gener idea of their appear we could not recal all the
architectur detail and therefor the minuti necessari to a perfect
reflect were want but job could not be got to understand thi
and so far from accept a natur explan of the matter which
wa after all though strang enough in all conscienc noth more
than an instanc of glorifi and perfect telepathi he set the whole
thing down as a manifest of the blackest magic i shall never
forget the howl of terror which he utter when he saw the more or less
perfect portrait of hi longscatt brethren stare at him from the
quiet water or the merri peal of laughter with which ayesha greet hi
constern as for leo he did not altogeth like it either but ran
hi finger through hi yellow curl and remark that it gave him the
creep
after about an hour of thi amus in the latter part of which job
did not particip the mute by sign indic that billali wa
wait for an audienc accordingli he wa told to crawl up which
he did as awkwardli as usual and announc that the danc wa readi
to begin if she and the white stranger would be pleas to attend
shortli afterward we all rose and ayesha have thrown a dark cloak
the same by the wai that she had worn when i saw her curs by the
fire over her white wrap we start the danc wa to be held in
the open air on the smooth rocki plateau in front of the great cave
and thither we made our wai about fifteen pace from the mouth of the
cave we found three chair place and here we sat and wait for as
yet no dancer were to be seen the night wa almost but not quit
dark the moon not have risen as yet which made us wonder how we
should be abl to see the danc
thou wilt present understand said ayesha with a littl laugh when
leo ask her and we certainli did scarc were the word out of her
mouth when from everi point we saw dark form rush up each bear
with him what we at first took to be an enorm flame torch whatev
thei were thei were burn furious for the flame stood out a
yard or more behind each bearer on thei came fifti or more of them
carri their flame burden and look like so mani devil from
hell leo wa the first to discov what these burden were
great heaven he said thei ar corps on fire
i stare and stare againh wa perfectli rightth torch that were
to light our entertain were human mummi from the cave
on rush the bearer of the flame corps and meet at a spot
about twenti pace in front of us built their ghastli burden crosswai
into a huge bonfir heaven how thei roar and flare no tar barrel
could have burnt as those mummi did nor wa thi all suddenli i
saw on great fellow seiz a flame human arm that had fallen from it
parent frame and rush off into the dark present he stop and
a tall streak of fire shot up into the air illumin the gloom and
also the lamp from which it sprang that lamp wa the mummi of a woman
ti to a stout stake let into the rock and he had fire her hair on
he went a few pace and touch a second then a third and a fourth
till at last we were surround on all three side by a great ring of
bodi flare furious the materi with which thei were preserv
have render them so inflamm that the flame would liter
spout out of the ear and mouth in tongu of fire a foot or more in
length
nero illumin hi garden with live christian soak in tar and
we were now treat to a similar spectacl probabl for the first time
sinc hi dai onli happili our lamp were not live on
but although thi element of horror wa fortun want to
describ the aw and hideou grandeur of the spectacl thu present
to us is i feel so absolut beyond my poor power that i scarc
dare attempt it to begin with it appeal to the moral as well as the
physic suscept there wa someth veri terribl and yet
veri fascin about the employ of the remot dead to illumin
the orgi of the live in itself the thing wa a satir both on the
live and the dead csar dustor is it alexandersmai stop a
bunghol but the function of these dead csar of the past wa to
light up a savag fetish danc to such base us mai we come of so
littl account mai we be in the mind of the eager multitud that we
shall breed mani of whom so far from rever our memori will live to
curs us for beget them into such a world of woe
then there wa the physic side of the spectacl and a weird and
splendid on it wa those old citizen of kr burnt as to judg from
their sculptur and inscript thei had live veri fast and with
the utmost liber what is more there were plenti of them as soon
as ever a mummi had burnt down to the ankl which it did in about
twenti minut the feet were kick awai and anoth on put in it
place the bonfir wa kept go on the same gener scale and it
flame shot up with a hiss and a crackl twenti or thirti feet into
the air throw great flash of light far out into the gloom through
which the dark form of the amahagg flit to and fro like
devil replenish the infern fire we all stood and stare
aghastshock and yet fascin at so strang a spectacl and half
expect to see the spirit those flame form had onc enclos come
creep from the shadow to work vengeanc on their desecr
i promis thee a strang sight my holli laugh ayesha whose
nerv alon did not seem to be affect and behold i have not
fail thee also it hath it lesson trust not to the futur for
who know what the futur mai bring therefor live for the dai and
endeavour not to escap the dust which seem to be man end what
thinkest thou those longforgotten nobl and ladi would have felt had
thei known that thei should on dai flare to light the danc or boil the
pot of savag but see here come the dancer a merri crewar thei
not the stage is litnow for the plai
as she spoke we perceiv two line of figur on male and the other
femal to the number of about a hundr each advanc round the human
bonfir arrai onli in the usual leopard and buck skin thei form
up in perfect silenc in two line face each other between us
and the fire and then the dancea sort of infern and fiendish
cancanbegan to describ it is quit imposs but though there wa
a good deal of toss of leg and doubleshuffl it seem to our
untutor mind to be more of a plai than a danc and as usual with
thi dread peopl whose mind seem to have taken their colour from
the cave in which thei live and whose joke and amus ar drawn
from the inexhaust store of preserv mortal with which thei
share their home the subject appear to be a most ghastli on i
know that it repres an attempt murder first of all and then the
burial aliv of the victim and hi struggl from the grave each act
of the abomin drama which wa carri on in perfect silenc be
round off and finish with a furiou and most revolt danc round
the suppos victim who writh upon the ground in the red light of the
bonfir
present howev thi pleas piec wa interrupt suddenli there
wa a slight commot and a larg power woman whom i had note as
on of the most vigor of the dancer came made mad and drunken with
unholi excit bound and stagger toward us shriek out as
she came
i want a black goat i must have a black goat bring me a black
goat and down she fell upon the rocki floor foam and writh and
shriek for a black goat about as hideou a spectacl as can well be
conceiv
instantli most of the dancer came up and got round her though some
still continu their caper in the background
she ha got a devil call out on of them run and get a black
goat there devil keep quiet keep quiet you shall have the goat
present thei have gone to fetch it devil
i want a black goat i must have a black goat shriek the foam
roll creatur again
all right devil the goat will be here present keep quiet there
a good devil
and so on till the goat taken from a neighbour kraal did at last
arriv be drag bleat on to the scene by it horn
is it a black on is it a black on shriek the possess
ye ye devil as black as night then asid keep it behind thee
dont let the devil see that it ha got a white spot on it rump and
anoth on it belli in on minut devil there cut hi throat quick
where is the saucer
the goat the goat the goat give me the blood of my black goat i
must have it dont you see i must have it oh oh oh give me the
blood of the goat
at thi moment a terrifi bah announc that the poor goat had been
sacrif and the next minut a woman ran up with a saucer full of
blood thi the possess creatur who wa then rave and foam her
wildest seiz and drank and wa instantli recov and without
a trace of hysteria or fit or be possess or whatev dread
thing it wa she wa suffer from she stretch her arm smile
faintli and walk quietli back to the dancer who present withdrew
in a doubl line as thei had come leav the space between us and the
bonfir desert
i thought that the entertain wa now over and feel rather
queer wa about to ask she if we could rise when suddenli what
at first i took to be a baboon came hop round the fire and wa
instantli met upon the other side by a lion or rather a human be
dress in a lion skin then came a goat then a man wrap in an
ox hide with the horn wobbl about in a ludicr wai after him
follow a blesbok then an impala then a koodoo then more goat and
mani other anim includ a girl sewn up in the shine scali hide
of a boaconstrictor sever yard of which trail along the ground
behind her when all the beast had collect thei began to danc about
in a lumber unnatur fashion and to imit the sound produc
by the respect anim thei repres till the whole air wa aliv
with roar and bleat and the hiss of snake thi went on for a
long time till get tire of the pantomim i ask ayesha if there
would be ani object to leo and myself walk round to inspect the
human torch and as she had noth to sai against it we start
strike round to the left after look at on or two of the flame
bodi we were about to return thoroughli disgust with the grotesqu
weird of the spectacl when our attent wa attract by on of
the dancer a particularli activ leopard that had separ itself
from it fellowbeast and wa whisk about in our immedi
neighbourhood but gradual draw into a spot where the shadow
wa darkest equidist between two of the flame mummi drawn by
curios we follow it when suddenli it dart past us into the
shadow beyond and as it did so erect itself and whisper come
in a voic that we both recognis as that of ustan without wait to
consult me leo turn and follow her into the outer dark and i
feel sick enough at heart went after them the leopard crawl on
for about fifti pacesa suffici distanc to be quit beyond the
light of the fire and torchesand then leo came up with it or rather
with ustan
oh my lord i heard her whisper so i have found thee listen i am
in peril of my life from shewhomustbeobei sure the baboon
ha told thee how she drove me from thee i love thee my lord and thou
art mine accord to the custom of the countri i save thy life my
lion wilt thou cast me off now
of cours not ejacul leo i have been wonder whither thou
hadst gone let us go and explain matter to the queen
nai nai she would slai us thou knowest not her powerth baboon
there he knoweth for he saw nai there is but on wai if thou wilt
cleav to me thou must flee with me across the marsh even now and
then perchanc we mai escap
for heaven sake leo i began but she broke in
nai listen not to him swiftb swiftdeath is in the air we
breath even now mayhap she heareth us and without more ado she
proceed to back her argument by throw herself into hi arm as
she did so the leopard head slip from her hair and i saw the three
white fingermark upon it gleam faintli in the starlight onc
more realis the desper natur of the posit i wa about to
interpos for i knew that leo wa not too strongmind where women
were concern whenoh horrori heard a littl silveri laugh behind
me i turn round and there wa she herself and with her billali
and two male mute i gasp and nearli sank to the ground for i knew
that such a situat must result in some dread tragedi of which it
seem exceedingli probabl to me that i should be the first victim as
for ustan she untwin her arm and cover her ey with her hand
while leo not know the full terror of the posit mere cover
up and look as foolish as a man caught in such a trap would natur
do
xx
triumph
then follow a moment of the most pain silenc that i ever endur
it wa broken by ayesha who address herself to leo
nai now my lord and guest she said in her softest tone which yet
had the ring of steel about them look not so bash sure the sight
wa a pretti oneth leopard and the lion
oh hang it all said leo in english
and thou ustan she went on sure i should have pass thee by
had not the light fallen on the white across thy hair and she point
to the bright edg of the rise moon which wa now appear abov
the horizon well well the danc is donese the taper have burnt
down and all thing end in silenc and in ash so thou thoughtest
it a fit time for love ustan my servantand i dream not that i
could be disobei thought thee alreadi far awai
plai not with me moan the wretch woman slai me and let there
be an end
nai why it is not well to go so swift from the hot lip of love down
to the cold mouth of the grave and she made a motion to the mute who
instantli step up and caught the girl by either arm with an oath leo
sprang upon the nearest and hurl him to the ground and then stood
over him with hi face set and hi fist readi
again ayesha laugh it wa well thrown my guest thou hast a strong
arm for on who so late wa sick but now out of thy courtesi i prai
thee let that man live and do my bid he shall not harm the girl
the night air grow chill and i would welcom her in mine own place
sure she whom thou dost favour shall be favour of me also
i took leo by the arm and pull him from the prostrat mute and he
half bewild obei the pressur then we all set out for the cave
across the plateau where a pile of white human ash wa all that
remain of the fire that had lit the danc for the dancer had
vanish
in due cours we gain ayesha boudoiral too soon it seem to me
have a sad presag of what wa to come ly heavi on my heart
ayesha seat herself upon her cushion and have dismiss job and
billali by sign bade the mute tend the lamp and retireal save
on girl who wa her favourit person attend we three remain
stand the unfortun ustan a littl to the left of the rest of us
now oh holli ayesha began how came it that thou who didst hear
my word bid thi evildoerand she point to ustaneto go
henceth at whose prayer i did weakli spare her lifehow came it
i sai that thou wast a sharer in what i saw tonight answer and for
thine own sake i sai speak all the truth for i am not mind to hear

i do believ thee oh holli she answer coldli and well it is for
thee that i dothen doe the whole guilt rest upon her
i do not find ani guilt therein broke in leo she is not anoth

ayesha listen in ici silenc and made no remark when he had
finish howev she address ustan
hast thou aught to sai woman thou silli straw thou feather who
didst think to float toward thy passion petti end even against the
great wind of my will tell me for i fain would understand why didst

and then i think i saw the most tremend exhibit of moral courag
and intrepid that it is possibl to conceiv for the poor doom
girl know what she had to expect at the hand of her terribl queen
know too from bitter experi how great wa her adversari
power yet gather herself togeth and out of the veri depth of her
despair drew materi to defi her
i did it oh she she answer draw herself up to the full of
her state height and throw back the panther skin from her head
becaus my love is stronger than the grave i did it becaus my life
without thi man whom my heart chose would be but a live death
therefor did i risk my life and now that i know that it is forfeit
to thine anger yet am i glad that i did risk it and pai it awai in the
risk ay becaus he embrac me onc and told me that he love me
yet
here ayesha half rose from her couch and then sank down again
i have no magic went on ustan her rich voic ring strong and
full and i am not a queen nor do i live for ever but a woman heart
is heavi to sink through water howev deep oh queen and a woman
ey ar quick to seeeven through thy veil oh queen
listen i know it thou dost love thi man thyself and therefor
wouldst thou destroi me who stand across thy path ay i diei die and
go into the dark nor know i whither i go but thi i know there is
a light shine in my breast and by that light as by a lamp i see
the truth and the futur that i shall not share unrol itself befor
me like a scroll when first i knew my lord and she point to leo i
knew also that death would be the bridal gift he gave meit rush upon
me of a sudden but i turn not back be readi to pai the price
and behold death is here and now even as i knew that so do i
stand on the step of doom know that thou shalt not reap the profit
of thy crime mine he is and though thy beauti shine like a sun among
the star mine shall he remain for thee never here in thi life shall
he look thee in the ey and call thee spous thou too art doom i
seeand her voic rang like the cry of an inspir prophetess ah i
see
then came an answer cry of mingl rage and terror i turn my head
ayesha had risen and wa stand with her outstretch hand point
at ustan who had suddenli stop speak i gaze at the poor
woman and as i gaze there came upon her face that same woeful fix
express of terror that i had seen onc befor when she had broken out
into her wild chant her ey grew larg her nostril dilat and her
lip blanch
ayesha said noth she made no sound she onli drew herself up
stretch out her arm and her tall veil frame quiver like an
aspen leaf appear to look fixedli at her victim even as she did so
ustan put her hand to her head utter on pierc scream turn
round twice and then fell backward with a thudpron upon the floor
both leo and myself rush to hersh wa stone deadblast into
death by some mysteri electr agenc or overwhelm willforc
whereof the dread she had command
for a moment leo did not quit realis what had happen but when he
did hi face wa aw to see with a savag oath he rose from besid
the corps and turn liter sprang at ayesha but she wa
watch and see him come stretch out her hand again and he
went stagger back toward me and would have fallen had i not
caught him afterward he told me that he felt as though he had suddenli
receiv a violent blow in the chest and what is more utterli cow
as if all the manhood had been taken out of him
then ayesha spoke forgiv me my guest she said softli address
him if i have shock thee with my justic
forgiv thee thou fiend roar poor leo wring hi hand in hi
rage and grief forgiv thee thou murderess by heaven i will kill
thee if i can

yet within a veri littl space shalt thou creep to my knee and swear
that thou dost love me answer ayesha with a sweet mock laugh
come there is no time like the present time here befor thi dead
girl who love thee let us put it to the proof
look now on me kallikr and with a sudden motion she shook her
gauzi cover from her and stood forth in her low kirtl and her snaki
zone in her gloriou radiant beauti and her imperi grace rise from
her wrap as it were like venu from the wave or galatea from her
marbl or a beatifi spirit from the tomb she stood forth and fix
her deep and glow ey upon leo ey and i saw hi clench fist
unclasp and hi set and quiver featur relax beneath her gaze
i saw hi wonder and astonish grow into admir and then into
fascin and the more he struggl the more i saw the power of her
dread beauti fasten on him and take possess of hi sens drug
them and draw the heart out of him did i not know the process had
not i who wa twice hi ag gone through it myself wa i not go
through it afresh even then although her sweet and passion gaze wa
not for me ye ala i wa ala that i should have to confess that
at that veri moment i wa rent by mad and furiou jealousi i could
have flown at him shame upon me the woman had confound and almost
destroi my moral sens as she wa bound to confound all who look
upon her superhuman loveli buti do not quit know howi got the
better of myself and onc more turn to see the climax of the tragedi
oh great heaven gasp leo art thou a woman
a woman in truthin veri truthand thine own spous kallikr
she answer stretch out her round ivori arm toward him and
smile ah so sweetli
he look and look and slowli i perceiv that he wa draw nearer
to her suddenli hi ey fell upon the corps of poor ustan and he
shudder and stop
how can i he said hoars thou art a murderess she love me
observ he wa alreadi forget that he had love her
it is naught she murmur and her voic sound sweet as the
nightwind pass through the tree it is naught at all if i have
sin let my beauti answer for my sin if i have sin it is for
love of thee let my sin therefor be put awai and forgotten and
onc more she stretch out her arm and whisper come and then in
anoth few second it wa all over
i saw him strugglei saw him even turn to fly but her ey drew
him more strongli than iron bond and the magic of her beauti and
concentr will and passion enter into him and overpow himai
even there in the presenc of the bodi of the woman who had love him
well enough to die for him it sound horribl and wick enough but he
should not be too greatli blame and be sure hi sin will find him out
the temptress who drew him into evil wa more than human and her beauti
wa greater than the loveli of the daughter of men
i look up again and now her perfect form lai in hi arm and her lip
were press against hi own and thu with the corps of hi dead
love for an altar did leo vincei plight hi troth to her redhand
murderessplight it for ever and a dai for those who sell themselv
into a like dominion pai down the price of their own honour and
throw their soul into the balanc to sink the scale to the level of
their lust can hope for no deliver here or hereaft as thei
have sown so shall thei reap and reap even when the poppi flower of
passion have wither in their hand and their harvest is but bitter
tare garner in satieti
suddenli with a snakelik motion she seem to slip from hi embrac
and then again broke out into her low laugh of triumphant mockeri
did i not tell thee that within a littl space thou wouldst creep to my
knee oh kallikr and sure the space ha not been a great on
leo groan in shame and miseri for though he wa overcom and
stricken down he wa not so lost as to be unawar of the depth of the
degrad to which he had sunk on the contrari hi better natur
rose up in arm against hi fallen self as i saw clearli enough later
on
ayesha laugh again and then quickli veil herself and made a sign
to the girl mute who had been watch the whole scene with curiou
startl ey the girl left and present return follow by two
male mute to whom the queen made anoth sign thereon thei all three
seiz the bodi of poor ustan by the arm and drag it heavili down
the cavern and awai through the curtain at the end leo watch it for
a littl while and then cover hi ey with hi hand and it too to
my excit fanci seem to watch us as it went
there pass the dead past said ayesha solemnli as the curtain
shook and fell back into their place when the ghastli process
had vanish behind them and then with on of those extraordinari
transit of which i have alreadi spoken she again threw off her
veil and broke out after the ancient and poetic fashion of the
dweller in arabia into a pan of triumph or epithalamium which
wild and beauti as it wa is exceedingli difficult to render into
english and ought by right to be sung to the music of a cantata
rather than written and read it wa divid into two partson
descript or definit and the other person and as nearli as i
can rememb ran as follow
love is like a flower in the desert
it is like the alo of arabia that bloom but onc and di it bloom
in the salt empti of life and the bright of it beauti is set
upon the wast as a star is set upon a storm
it hath the sun abov that is the spirit and abov it blow the air of
it divin
at the echo of a step love bloom i sai i sai love bloom and
bend her beauti down to him who passeth by
he plucketh it yea he plucketh the red cup that is full of honei
and beareth it awai awai across the desert awai till the flower be
wither awai till the desert be done
there is onli on perfect flower in the wilder of life
that flower is love
there is onli on fix star in the midst of our wander
that star is love
there is onli on hope in our despair night
that hope is love
all els is fals all els is shadow move upon water all els is
wind and vaniti
who shall sai what is the weight or the measur of love
it is born of the flesh it dwelleth in the spirit from each doth it
draw it comfort
for beauti it is as a star
mani ar it shape but all ar beauti and none know where the star
rose or the horizon where it shall set
among the ancient arabian the power of poetic
declam either in vers or prose wa held in the
highest honour and esteem and he who excel in it wa
known as khteb or orat everi year a gener assembl
wa held at which the rival poet repeat their
composit when those poem which were judg to be the
best were so soon as the knowledg and the art of write
becam gener inscrib on silk in letter of gold and
publicli exhibit be known as al modhahabt or
golden vers in the poem given abov by mr holli ayesha
evid follow the tradit poetic manner of her
peopl which wa to embodi their thought in a seri of
somewhat disconnect sentenc each remark for it
beauti and the grace of it express editor
then turn to leo and lai her hand upon hi shoulder she went
on in a fuller and more triumphant tone speak in balanc sentenc
that gradual grew and swell from idealis prose into pure and
majest vers
long have i love thee oh my love yet ha my love not lessen
long have i wait for thee and behold my reward is at handi here
far awai i saw thee onc and thou wast taken from me
then in a grave sow i the seed of patienc and shone upon it with the
sun of hope and water it with tear of repent and breath on
it with the breath of my knowledg and now lo it hath sprung up and
born fruit lo out of the grave hath it sprung yea from among the
dry bone and ash of the dead
i have wait and my reward is with me
i have overcom death and death brought back to me him that wa dead
therefor do i rejoic for fair is the futur
green ar the path that we shall tread across the everlast meadow
the hour is at hand night hath fled awai into the vallei
the dawn kisseth the mountain top
soft shall we live my love and easi shall we go
crown shall we be with the diadem of king
worship and wonder struck all peopl of the world blind shall
fall befor our beauti and might
from time unto time shall our great thunder on roll like a
chariot through the dust of endless dai
laugh shall we speed in our victori and pomp laugh like the
daylight as he leap along the hill
onward still triumphant to a triumph ever new
onward in our power to a power unattain
onward never weari clad with splendour for a robe
till accomplish be our fate and the night is rush down
she paus in her strang and most thrill allegor chant of
which i am unfortun onli abl to give the burden and that feebli
enough and then said
perchanc thou dost not believ my word kallikratesperch thou
thinkest that i do delud thee and that i have not live these mani
year and that thou hast not been born again to me nai look not
soput awai that pale cast of doubt for oh be sure herein can error
find no foothold sooner shall the sun forget their cours and the
swallow miss her nest than my soul shall swear a lie and be led astrai
from thee kallikr blind me take awai mine ey and let the
dark utterli fenc me in and still mine ear would catch the tone
of thy unforgotten voic strike more loud against the portal of
my sens than can the call of brazenthro clarionsstop up mine
hear also and let a thousand touch me on the brow and i would name
thee out of allyea rob me of everi sens and see me stand deaf and
blind and dumb and with nerv that cannot weigh the valu of a touch
yet would my spirit leap within me like a quicken child and cry unto
my heart behold kallikr behold thou watcher the watch of
thy night ar end behold thou who seekest in the night season thy
morn star ariseth
she paus awhil and then continu but stai if thy heart is yet
harden against the mighti truth and thou dost requir a further pledg
of that which thou dost find too deep to understand even now shall it
be given to thee and to thee also oh my holli bear each on of you a
lamp and follow after me whither i shall lead you
without stop to thinkinde speak for myself i had almost
abandon the function in circumst under which to think seem
to be absolut useless sinc thought fell hourli helpless against a
black wall of wonderw took the lamp and follow her go to the
end of her boudoir she rais a curtain and reveal a littl stair
of the sort that is so common in these dim cave of kr as we hurri
down the stair i observ that the step were worn in the centr to
such an extent that some of them had been reduc from seven and a half
inch at which i guess their origin height to about three and
a half now all the other step that i had seen in the cave were
practic unworn as wa to be expect see that the onli traffic
which ever pass upon them wa that of those who bore a fresh burden to
the tomb therefor thi fact struck my notic with that curiou forc
with which littl thing do strike us when our mind ar absolut
overwhelm by a sudden rush of power sensat beaten flat as it
were like a sea beneath the first burst of a hurrican so that everi
littl object on the surfac start into an unnatur promin
at the bottom of the staircas i stood and stare at the worn step and
ayesha turn saw me
wonderest thou whose ar the feet that have worn awai the rock my
holli she ask thei ar mineeven mine own light feet i can
rememb when those stair were fresh and level but for two thousand
year and more have i gone down hither dai by dai and see my sandal
have worn out the solid rock
i made no answer but i do not think that anyth that i had heard or
seen brought home to my limit understand so clear a sens of thi
be overwhelm antiqu as that hard rock hollow out by her
soft white feet how mani hundr of thousand of time must she have
pass up and down that stair to bring about such a result
the stair led to a tunnel and a few pace down the tunnel wa on of
the usual curtainhung doorwai a glanc at which told me that it
wa the same where i had been a wit of that terribl scene by the
leap flame i recognis the pattern of the curtain and the sight of
it brought the whole event vividli befor my ey and made me trembl
even at it memori ayesha enter the tomb for it wa a tomb and we
follow heri for on rejoic that the mysteri of the place wa
about to be clear up and yet afraid to face it solut
xxi
the dead and live meet
see now the place where i have slept for these two thousand year
said ayesha take the lamp from leo hand and hold it abov her
head it rai fell upon a littl hollow in the floor where i had seen
the leap flame but the fire wa out now thei fell upon the white
form stretch there beneath it wrap upon it bed of stone
upon the fret carv of the tomb and upon anoth shelf of stone
opposit the on on which the bodi lai and separ from it by the
breadth of the cave
here went on ayesha lai her hand upon the rockher have i
slept night by night for all these gener with but a cloak to
cover me it did not becom me that i should lie soft when my spous
yonder and she point to the rigid form lai stiff in death here
night by night have i slept in hi cold companytil thou seest thi
thick slab like the stair down which we pass ha worn thin with the
toss of my formso faith have i been to thee even in thy space
of sleep kallikr and now mine own thou shalt see a wonder
thingliv thou shalt behold thyself deadfor well have i tend
thee dure all these year kallikr art thou prepar
we made no answer but gaze at each other with frighten ey the
whole scene wa so dread and so solemn ayesha advanc and laid her
hand upon the corner of the shroud and onc more spoke
be not affright she said though the thing seem wonder to
theeall we who live have thu live befor nor is the veri shape
that hold us a stranger to the sun onli we know it not becaus memori
write no record and earth hath gather in the earth she lent us for
none have save our glori from the grave but i by my art and by the
art of those dead men of kr which i have learn have held thee
back oh kallikr from the dust that the waxen stamp of beauti
on thy face should ever rest befor mine ey twa a mask that memori
might fill serv to fashion out thy presenc from the past and
give it strength to wander in the habit of my thought clad in a
mummeri of life that stai my appetit with vision of dead dai
behold now let the dead and live meet across the gulf of time thei
still ar on time hath no power against ident though sleep the
merci hath blot out the tablet of our mind and with oblivion
seal the sorrow that els would hound us from life to life stuf
the brain with gather grief till it burst in the mad of uttermost
despair still ar thei on for the wrap of our sleep shall roll
awai as thundercloud befor the wind the frozen voic of the past
shall melt in music like mountain snow beneath the sun and the weep
and the laughter of the lost hour shall be heard onc more most sweetli
echo up the cliff of immeasur time
ay the sleep shall roll awai and the voic shall be heard when down
the complet chain whereof our each exist is a link the lightn
of the spirit hath pass to work out the purpos of our be
quicken and fuse those separ dai of life and shape them to
a staff whereon we mai safe lean as we wend to our appoint fate
therefor have no fear kallikr when thouliv and but late
bornshalt look upon thine own depart self who breath and di
so long ago i do but turn on page in thy book of be and show thee
what is writ thereon
behold
with a sudden motion she drew the shroud from the cold form and let the
lamplight plai upon it i look and then shrank back terrifi sinc
sai what she might in explan the sight wa an uncanni onefor her
explan were beyond the grasp of our finit mind and when thei
were strip from the mist of vagu esoter philosophi and brought
into conflict with the cold and horrifi fact did not do much to
break it forc for there stretch upon the stone bier befor us
robe in white and perfectli preserv wa what appear to be the bodi
of leo vincei i stare from leo stand there aliv to leo ly
there dead and could see no differ except perhap that the
bodi on the bier look older featur for featur thei were the same
even down to the crop of littl golden curl which wa leo most
uncommon beauti it even seem to me as i look that the express
on the dead man face resembl that which i had sometim seen upon
leo when he wa plung into profound sleep i can onli sum up the
close of the resembl by sai that i never saw twin so exactli
similar as that dead and live pair
i turn to see what effect wa produc upon leo by the sight of hi
dead self and found it to be on of partial stupefact he stood
for two or three minut stare and said noth and when at last he
spoke it wa onli to ejacul
cover it up and take me awai
nai wait kallikr said ayesha who stand with the lamp
rais abov her head flood with it light her own rich beauti and
the cold wonder of the deathcloth form upon the bier resembl
an inspir sibyl rather than a woman as she roll out her majest
sentenc with a grandeur and a freedom of utter which i am ala
quit unabl to reproduc
wait i would show thee someth that no tittl of my crime mai be
hidden from thee do thou oh holli open the garment on the breast
of the dead kallikr for perchanc my lord mai fear to touch it
himself
i obei with trembl hand it seem a desecr and an unhallow
thing to touch that sleep imag of the live man by my side present
hi broad chest wa bare and there upon it right over the heart wa a
wound evid inflict with a spear
thou seest kallikr she said know then that it wa i who slew
thee in the place of life i gave thee death i slew thee becaus of
the egyptian amenarta whom thou didst love for by her wile she held
thy heart and her i could not smite as but now i smote that woman for
she wa too strong for me in my hast and bitter anger i slew thee and
now for all these dai have i lament thee and wait for thy come
and thou hast come and none can stand between thee and me and of a
truth now for death i will give thee lifenot life etern for that
none can give but life and youth that shall endur for thousand upon
thousand of year and with it pomp and power and wealth and all
thing that ar good and beauti such as have been to no man befor
thee nor shall be to ani man who come after and now on thing more
and thou shalt rest and make readi for the dai of thy new birth thou
seest thi bodi which wa thine own for all these centuri it hath
been my cold comfort and my companion but now i need it no more for
i have thy live presenc and it can but serv to stir up memori
of that which i would fain forget let it therefor go back to the dust
from which i held it
behold i have prepar against thi happi hour and go to the
other shelf or stone ledg which she said had serv her for a bed she
took from it a larg vitrifi doublehand vase the mouth of which
wa ti up with a bladder thi she loos and then have bent down
and gentli kiss the white forehead of the dead man she undid the
vase and sprinkl it content carefulli over the form take i
observ the greatest precaut against ani drop of them touch
us or herself and then pour out what remain of the liquid upon the
chest and head instantli a dens vapour aros and the cave wa fill
with choke fume that prevent us from see anyth while the
deadli acid for i presum it wa some tremend prepar of that
sort did it work from the spot where the bodi lai came a fierc
fizz and crack sound which ceas howev befor the fume had
clear awai at last thei were all gone except a littl cloud that
still hung over the corps in a coupl of minut more thi too had
vanish and wonder as it mai seem it is a fact that on the stone
bench that had support the mortal remain of the ancient kallikr
for so mani centuri there wa now noth to be seen but a few
hand of smoke white powder the acid had utterli destroi the
bodi and even in place eaten into the stone ayesha stoop down and
take a hand of thi powder in her grasp threw it into the air
sai at the same time in a voic of calm solemn
dust to dustth past to the pastth dead to the
deadkallikr is dead and is born again
the ash float noiselessli to the rocki floor and we stood in aw
silenc and watch them fall too overcom for word
now leav me she said and sleep if ye mai i must watch and think
for tomorrow night we go henc and the time is long sinc i trod the
path that we must follow
accordingli we bow and left her
as we pass to our own apart i peep into job sleep place
to see how he fare for he had gone awai just befor our interview with
the murder ustan quit prostrat by the terror of the amahagg
festiv he wa sleep soundli good honest fellow that he wa
and i rejoic to think that hi nerv which like those of most
uneduc peopl were far from strong had been spare the close
scene of thi dread dai then we enter our own chamber and here
at last poor leo who ever sinc he had look upon that frozen
imag of hi live self had been in a state not far remov from
stupefact burst out into a torrent of grief now that he wa no
longer in the presenc of the dread she hi sens of the aw
of all that had happen and more especi of the wick murder of
ustan who wa bound to him by ti so close broke upon him like a
storm and lash him into an agoni of remors and terror which wa
pain to wit he curs himselfh curs the hour when we had
first seen the write on the sherd which wa be so mysteri
verifi and bitterli he curs hi own weak ayesha he dare not
cursewho dare speak evil of such a woman whose conscious for
aught we knew wa watch us at the veri moment
what am i to do old fellow he groan rest hi head against my
shoulder in the extrem of hi grief i let her be killednot that
i could help that but within five minut i wa kiss her murderess
over her bodi i am a degrad brute but i cannot resist that and
here hi voic sankthat aw sorceress i know i shall do it again
tomorrow i know that i am in her power for alwai if i never saw her
again i should never think of anybodi els dure all my life i must
follow her as a needl follow a magnet i would not go awai now if i
could i could not leav her my leg would not carri me but my mind is
still clear enough and in my mind i hate herat least i think so it
is all so horribl and thatthat bodi what can i make of it it wa
i i am sold into bondag old fellow and she will take my soul as
the price of herself
then for the first time i told him that i wa in a but veri littl
better posit and i am bound to sai that notwithstand hi own
infatu he had the decenc to sympathis with me perhap he did
not think it worth while be jealou realis that he had no caus
so far as the ladi wa concern i went on to suggest that we should
try to run awai but we soon reject the project as futil and to be
perfectli honest i do not believ that either of us would realli have
left ayesha even if some superior power had suddenli offer to convei
us from these gloomi cave and set us down in cambridg we could no
more have left her than a moth can leav the light that destroi it we
were like confirm opiumeat in our moment of reason we well knew
the deadli natur of our pursuit but we certainli were not prepar to
abandon it terribl delight
no man who onc had seen she unveil and heard the music of her
voic and drunk in the bitter wisdom of her word would willingli give
up the sight for a whole sea of placid joi how much more then wa
thi like to be so when as in leo case to put myself out of the
question thi extraordinari creatur declar her utter and absolut
devot and gave what appear to be proof of it have last for
some two thousand year
no doubt she wa a wick person and no doubt she had murder ustan
when she stood in her path but then she wa veri faith and by a
law of natur man is apt to think but lightli of a woman crime
especi if that woman be beauti and the crime be commit for
the love of him
and then for the rest when had such a chanc ever come to a man befor
as that which now lai in leo hand true in unit himself to thi
dread woman he would place hi life under the influenc of a mysteri
creatur of evil tendenc but then that would be like enough to
happen to him in ani ordinari marriag on the other hand howev no
ordinari marriag could bring him such aw beautyfor aw is the
onli word that can describ itsuch divin devot such wisdom and
command over the secret of natur and the place and power that thei
must win or lastli the royal crown of unend youth if inde she
could give that no on the whole it is not wonder that though leo
wa plung in bitter shame and grief such as ani gentleman would have
felt under the circumst he wa not readi to entertain the idea of
run awai from hi extraordinari fortun
after some month of consider of thi statement i
am bound to confess that i am not quit satisfi of it
truth it is perfectli true that ayesha commit a murder
but i shrewdli suspect that were we endow with the same
absolut power and if we had the same tremend interest
at stake we would be veri apt to do likewis under parallel
circumst also it must be rememb that she look
on it as an execut for disobedi under a system which
made the slightest disobedi punish by death put
asid thi question of the murder her evildo resolv
itself into the express of view and the acknowledg
of motiv which ar contrari to our preach if not to our
practic now at first sight thi might be fairli taken as a
proof of an evil natur but when we come to consid the
great antiqu of the individu it becom doubt if it
wa anyth more than the natur cynic which aris
from ag and bitter experi and the possess of
extraordinari power of observ it is a well known fact
that veri often put the period of boyhood out of the
question the older we grow the more cynic and harden we
get inde mani of us ar onli save by time death from
utter moral petrifact if not moral corrupt no on
will deni that a young man is on the averag better than an
old on for he is without that experi of the order of
thing that in certain thought disposit can hardli
fail to produc cynic and that disregard of acknowledg
method and establish custom which we call evil now the
oldest man upon the earth wa but a babe compar to ayesha
and the wisest man upon the earth wa not onethird as wise
and the fruit of her wisdom wa thi that there wa but on
thing worth live for and that wa love in it highest
sens and to gain that good thing she wa not prepar to
stop at trifl thi is realli the sum of her evil do
and it must be rememb on the other hand that whatev
mai be thought of them she had some virtu develop to a
degre veri uncommon in either sexconst for
instancel h h
my own opinion is that he would have been mad if he had done so but
then i confess that my statement on the matter must be accept with
qualif i am in love with ayesha myself to thi dai and i would
rather have been the object of her affect for on short week than
that of ani other woman in the world for a whole lifetim and let me
add that if anybodi who doubt thi statement and think me foolish
for make it could have seen ayesha draw her veil and flash out in
beauti on hi gaze hi view would exactli coincid with my own of
cours i am speak of ani man we never had the advantag of a
ladi opinion of ayesha but i think it quit possibl that she
would have regard the queen with dislik would have express her
disapprov in some more or less point manner and ultim have got
herself blast
for two hour or more leo and i sat with shaken nerv and frighten
ey and talk over the miracul event through which we were
pass it seem like a dream or a fairi tale instead of the solemn
sober fact who would have believ that the write on the potsherd wa
not onli true but that we should live to verifi it truth and that
we two seeker should find her who wa sought patient await our
come in the tomb of kr who would have thought that in the person
of leo thi mysteri woman should as she believ discov the
be whom she await from centuri to centuri and whose former earthli
habit she had till thi veri night preserv but so it wa in the
face of all we had seen it wa difficult for us as ordinari reason
men ani longer to doubt it truth and therefor at last with humbl
heart and a deep sens of the impot of human knowledg and the
insol of it assumpt that deni that to be possibl which it ha
no experi of we laid ourselv down to sleep leav our fate in
the hand of that watch provid which had thu chosen to allow us
to draw the veil of human ignor and reveal to us for good or evil
some glimps of the possibl of life

to old job who wa on of the best and honestest men i have ever had
to do with in ani class of life and realli more of a friend than a
servant and the mere idea of anyth happen to him brought a lump
into my throat beneath all hi ludicr talk i could see that he
himself wa quit convinc that someth wa go to happen
and though in most case these convict turn out to be utter
moonshineand thi particular on especi wa to be ampli account
for by the gloomi and unaccustom surround in which it victim
wa placedstil it did more or less carri a chill to my heart as ani
dread that is obvious a genuin object of belief is apt to do howev
absurd the belief mai be present the breakfast arriv and with it
leo who had been take a walk outsid the caveto clear hi mind he
saidand veri glad i wa to see both for thei gave me a respit
from my gloomi thought after breakfast we went for anoth walk and
watch some of the amahagg sow a plot of ground with the grain
from which thei make their beer thi thei did in scriptur fashiona
man with a bag made of goat hide fasten round hi waist walk up
and down the plot and scatter the seed as he went it wa a posit
relief to see on of these dread peopl do anyth so home and
pleasant as sow a field perhap becaus it seem to link them as it
were with the rest of human
as we were return billali met us and inform us that it wa she
pleasur that we should wait upon her and accordingli we enter her
presenc not without trepid for ayesha wa certainli an except
to the rule familiar with her might and did breed passion and wonder
and horror but it certainli did not breed contempt
we were as usual shown in by the mute and after these had
retir ayesha unveil and onc more bade leo embrac her which
notwithstand hi heartsearch of the previou night he did with
more alacr and fervour than in strict courtesi requir
she laid her white hand on hi head and look him fondli in the ey
dost thou wonder my kallikr she said when thou shalt call me
all thine own and when we shall of a truth be for on anoth and to
on anoth i will tell thee first must thou be even as i am not
immort inde for that i am not but so case and harden against
the attack of time that hi arrow shall glanc from the armour of thy
vigor life as the sunbeam glanc from water as yet i mai not mate
with thee for thou and i ar differ and the veri bright of my
be would burn thee up and perchanc destroi thee thou couldst not
even endur to look upon me for too long a time lest thine ey should
ach and thy sens swim and therefor with a littl nod shall
i present veil myself again thi by the wai she did not do no
listen thou shalt not be tri beyond endur for thi veri
even an hour befor the sun goe down shall we start henc and
by tomorrow dark if all goe well and the road is not lost to me
which i prai it mai not be shall we stand in the place of life and
thou shalt bath in the fire and come forth glorifi as no man ever
wa befor thee and then kallikr shalt thou call me wife and i
will call thee husband
leo mutter someth in answer to thi astonish statement i do not
know what and she laugh a littl at hi confus and went on
and thou too oh holli on thee also will i confer thi boon and then
of a truth shalt thou be evergreen and thi will i dowel becaus
thou hast pleas me holli for thou art not altogeth a fool like
most of the son of men and becaus though thou hast a school of
philosophi as full of nonsens as those of the old dai yet hast thou
not forgotten how to turn a pretti phrase about a ladi ey
hulloa old fellow whisper leo with a return of hi old
cheer have you been pai compliment i should never have
thought it of you
i thank thee oh ayesha i repli with as much digniti as i could
command but if there be such a place as thou dost describ and if in
thi strang place there mai be found a fieri virtu that can hold off
death when he come to pluck us by the hand yet would i none of it for
me oh ayesha the world ha not prove so soft a nest that i would lie
in it for ever a stonyheart mother is our earth and stone ar the
bread she give her children for their daili food stone to eat and
bitter water for their thirst and stripe for tender nurtur who would
endur thi for mani live who would so load up hi back with memori
of lost hour and love and of hi neighbour sorrow that he cannot
lessen and wisdom that bring not consol hard is it to die
becaus our delic flesh doth shrink back from the worm it will not
feel and from that unknown which the windingsheet doth curtain from
our view but harder still to my fanci would it be to live on green
in the leaf and fair but dead and rotten at the core and feel that
other secret worm of recollect gnaw ever at the heart
bethink thee holli she said yet doth long life and strength and
beauti beyond measur mean power and all thing that ar dear to man
and what oh queen i answer ar those thing that ar dear to
man ar thei not bubbl is not ambit but an endless ladder by
which no height is ever climb till the last unreach rung is
mount for height lead on to height and there is no restingplac
upon them and rung doth grow upon rung and there is no limit to the
number doth not wealth satiat and becom nauseou and no longer
serv to satisfi or pleasur or to bui an hour peac of mind and is
there ani end to wisdom that we mai hope to reach it rather the more
we learn shall we not therebi be abl onli to better compass out our
ignor did we live ten thousand year could we hope to solv the
secret of the sun and of the space beyond the sun and of the hand
that hung them in the heaven would not our wisdom be but as a gnaw
hunger call our conscious dai by dai to a knowledg of the empti
crave of our soul would it not be but as a light in on of these
great cavern that though bright it burn and brighter yet doth but
the more serv to show the depth of the gloom around it and what good
thing is there beyond that we mai gain by length of dai
nai my holli there is lovelov which make all thing beauti
and doth breath divin into the veri dust we tread with love shall
life roll glorious on from year to year like the voic of some great
music that hath power to hold the hearer heart pois on eagl wing
abov the sordid shame and folli of the earth
it mai be so i answer but if the love on prove a broken reed to
pierc us or if the love be love in vainwhat then shall a man grave
hi sorrow upon a stone when he hath but need to write them on
the water nai oh she i will live my dai and grow old with my
gener and die my appoint death and be forgotten for i do hope
for an immort to which the littl span that perchanc thou canst
confer will be but as a finger length laid against the measur of the
great world and mark thi the immort to which i look and which
my faith doth promis me shall be free from the bond that here must
tie my spirit down for while the flesh endur sorrow and evil and
the scorpion whip of sin must endur also but when the flesh hath
fallen from us then shall the spirit shine forth clad in the bright
of etern good and for it common air shall breath so rare an ether
of most nobl thought that the highest aspir of our manhood or
the purest incens of a maiden prayer would prove too earthli gross
to float therein
thou lookest high answer ayesha with a littl laugh and speakest
clearli as a trumpet and with no uncertain sound and yet methink that
but now didst thou talk of that unknown from which the windingsheet
doth curtain us but perchanc thou seest with the ey of faith gaze
on that bright that is to be through the paintedglass of thy
imagin strang ar the pictur of the futur that mankind can
thu draw with thi brush of faith and thi manycolour pigment of
imagin strang too that no on of them doth agre with anoth
i could tell theebut there what is the us why rob a fool of hi
baubl let it pass and i prai oh holli that when thou dost feel old
ag creep slowli toward thyself and the confus of senil make
havoc in thy brain thou mayest not bitterli regret that thou didst cast
awai the imperi boon i would have given to thee but so it hath ever
been man can never be content with that which hi hand can pluck if
a lamp be in hi reach to light him through the dark he must need
cast it down becaus it is no star happi danceth ever apac befor
him like the marshfir in the swamp and he must catch the fire and
he must hold the star beauti is naught to him becaus there ar lip
more honeysweet and wealth is naught becaus other can weigh him
down with heavier shekel and fame is naught becaus there have
been greater men than he thyself thou saidst it and i turn thy word
against thee well thou dreamest that thou shalt pluck the star i
believ it not and i think thee a fool my holli to throw awai the
lamp
i made no answer for i could notespeci befor leotel her that
sinc i had seen her face i knew that it would alwai be befor my ey
and that i had no wish to prolong an exist which must alwai be
haunt and tortur by her memori and by the last bitter of
unsatisfi love but so it wa and so ala is it to thi hour
and now went on she chang her tone and the subject togeth
tell me my kallikr for as yet i know it not how came ye to seek
me here yesternight thou didst sai that kallikrateshim whom thou
sawestwa thine ancestor how wa it tell methou dost not speak
overmuch
thu adjur leo told her the wonder stori of the casket and of the
potsherd that written on by hi ancestress the egyptian amenarta had
been the mean of guid us to her ayesha listen intent and when
he had finish spoke to me
did i not tell thee on dai when we did talk of good and evil oh
hollyit wa when my belov lai so illthat out of good came evil
and out of evil goodthat thei who sow knew not what the crop
should be nor he who struck where the blow should fall see now thi
egyptian amenarta thi royal child of the nile who hate me and whom
even now i hate for in a wai she did prevail against mese now she
herself hath been the veri mean to bring her lover to mine arm for
her sake i slew him and now behold through her he hath come back to
me she would have done me evil and sow her seed that i might reap
tare and behold she hath given me more than all the world can give
and there is a strang squar for thee to fit into thy circl of good
and evil oh holli
and so she went on after a pauseand so she bade her son destroi
me if he might becaus i slew hi father and thou my kallikr art
the father and in a sens thou art likewis the son and wouldst thou
aveng thy wrong and the wrong of that faroff mother of thine upon
me oh kallikr see and she slid to her knee and drew the white
corsag still farther down her ivori bosomse here beat my heart
and there by thy side is a knife heavi and long and sharp the veri
knife to slai an er woman with take it now and be aveng strike
and strike homeso shalt thou be satisfi kallikr and go
through life a happi man becaus thou hast paid back the wrong and
obei the mandat of the past
he look at her and then stretch out hi hand and lift her to her
feet
rise ayesha he said sadli well thou knowest that i cannot strike
thee no not even for the sake of her whom thou slewest but last
night i am in thy power and a veri slave to thee how can i kill
theesoon should i slai myself
almost dost thou begin to love me kallikr she answer smile
and now tell me of thy countryti a great peopl is it not with an
empir like that of rome sure thou wouldst return thither and it is
well for i mean not that thou shouldst dwell in these cave of kr
nai when onc thou art even as i am we will go hencefear not but
that i shall find a pathand then shall we journei to thi england of
thine and live as it becometh us to live two thousand year have i
wait for the dai when i should see the last of these hate cave and
thi gloomyvisag folk and now it is at hand and my heart bound up
to meet it like a child toward it holidai for thou shalt rule thi
england
but we have a queen alreadi broke in leo hastili
it is naught it is naught said ayesha she can be overthrown
at thi we both broke out into an exclam of dismai and explain
that we should as soon think of overthrow ourselv
but here is a strang thing said ayesha in astonish a queen
whom her peopl love sure the world must have chang sinc i dwelt
in kr
again we explain that it wa the charact of monarch that had
chang and that the on under whom we live wa vener and belov
by all rightthink peopl in her vast realm also we told her that
real power in our countri rest in the hand of the peopl and that we
were in fact rule by the vote of the lower and least educ class
of the commun
ah she said a democracythen sure there is a tyrant for i have
long sinc seen that democraci have no clear will of their own in
the end set up a tyrant and worship him
ye i said we have our tyrant
well she answer resignedli we can at ani rate destroi these
tyrant and kallikr shall rule the land
i instantli inform ayesha that in england blast wa not an
amus that could be indulg in with impun and that ani such
attempt would meet with the consider of the law and probabl end
upon a scaffold
the law she laugh with scornth law canst thou not understand
oh holli that i am abov the law and so shall my kallikr be also
all human law will be to us as the north wind to a mountain doe the
wind bend the mountain or the mountain the wind
and now leav me i prai thee and thou too my own kallikr for
i would get me readi against our journei and so must ye both and your
servant also but bring no great quantiti of thing with thee for i
trust that we shall be but three dai gone then shall we return hither
and i will make a plan wherebi we can bid farewel for ever to these
sepulchr of kr yea sure thou mayst kiss my hand
so we went i for on medit deepli on the aw natur of the
problem that now open out befor us the terribl she had evid
made up her mind to go to england and it made me absolut shudder
to think what would be the result of her arriv there what her power
were i knew and i could not doubt but that she would exercis them
to the full it might be possibl to control her for a while but her
proud ambiti spirit would be certain to break loos and aveng
itself for the long centuri of it solitud she would if necessari
and if the power of her beauti did not unaid prove equal to the
occas blast her wai to ani end she set befor her and as she could
not die and for aught i knew could not even be kill what wa
there to stop her in the end she would i had littl doubt assum
absolut rule over the british dominion and probabl over the whole
earth and though i wa sure that she would speedili make our the most
gloriou and prosper empir that the world ha ever seen it would be
at the cost of a terribl sacrific of life
i regret to sai that i wa never abl to ascertain if
she wa invulner against the ordinari accid of
life presum thi wa so els some misadventur would
have been sure to put an end to her in the cours of so mani
centuri true she offer to let leo slai her but veri
probabl thi wa onli an experi to try hi temper and
mental attitud toward her ayesha never gave wai to
impuls without some valid objectl h h
the whole thing sound like a dream or some extraordinari invent of
a specul brain and yet it wa a facta wonder factof which
the whole world would soon be call on to take notic what wa the
mean of it all after much think i could onli conclud that thi
marvel creatur whose passion had kept her for so mani centuri
chain as it were and compar harmless wa now about to be us
by provid as a mean to chang the order of the world and possibl
by the build up of a power that could no more be rebel against
or question than the decre of fate to chang it materi for the
better

the templ of truth
our prepar did not take us veri long we put a chang of cloth
apiec and some spare boot into my gladston bag also we took our
revolv and an express rifl each togeth with a good suppli of
ammunit a precaut to which under provid we subsequ
ow our live over and over again the rest of our gear togeth with
our heavi rifl we left behind us
a few minut befor the appoint time we onc more attend in
ayesha boudoir and found her also readi her dark cloak thrown over
her windingsheetlik wrap
ar ye prepar for the great ventur she said
we ar i answer though for my part ayesha i have no faith in
it
ah my holli she said thou art of a truth like those old jewsof
whom the memori vex me so sorelyunbeliev and hard to accept
that which thei have not known but thou shalt see for unless my mirror
beyond li and she point to the font of crystal water the path is
yet open as it wa of old time and now let us start upon the new life
which shall endwho knoweth where
ah i echo who knoweth where and we pass down into the great
central cave and out into the light of dai at the mouth of the cave we
found a singl litter with six bearer all of them mute wait and
with them i wa reliev to see our old friend billali for whom i
had conceiv a sort of affect it appear that for reason not
necessari to explain at length ayesha had thought it best that with
the except of herself we should proce on foot and thi we were
noth loth to do after our long confin in these cave
which howev suitabl thei might be for sarcophagia singularli
inappropri word by the wai for these particular tomb which
certainli did not consum the bodi given to their keepingwer
depress habit for breath mortal like ourselv either by
accid or by the order of she the space in front of the cave where
we had beheld that aw danc wa perfectli clear of spectat not
a soul wa to be seen and consequ i do not believ that our
departur wa known to anybodi except perhap the mute who wait on
she and thei were of cours in the habit of keep what thei saw
to themselv
in a few minut time we were step out sharpli across the great
cultiv plain or lake bed frame like a vast emerald in it set
of frown cliff and had anoth opportun of wonder at the
extraordinari natur of the site chosen by these old peopl of kr for
their capit and at the marvel amount of labour ingenu and
engin skill that must have been brought into requisit by the
founder of the citi to drain so huge a sheet of water and to keep
it clear of subsequ accumul it is inde so far as my
experi goe an unequal instanc of what man can do in the face
of natur for in my opinion such achiev as the suez canal or
even the mont ceni tunnel do not approach thi ancient undertak in
magnitud and grandeur of concept
when we had been walk for about half an hour enjoi ourselv
exceedingli in the delight cool which about thi time of the dai
alwai appear to descend upon the great plain of kr and which in
some degre aton for the want of ani land or sea breezefor all wind
wa kept off by the rocki mountain wallw began to get a clear view of
what billali had inform us were the ruin of the great citi and even
from that distanc we could see how wonder those ruin were a fact
which with everi step we took becam more evid the town wa not
veri larg if compar to babylon or thebe or other citi of remot
antiqu perhap it outer wall contain some twelv squar mile of
ground or a littl more nor had the wall so far as we could judg
when we reach them been veri high probabl not more than forti feet
which wa about their present height where thei had not through the
sink of the ground or some such caus fallen into ruin the reason
of thi no doubt wa that the peopl of kr be protect from ani
outsid attack by far more tremend rampart than ani that the hand of
man could rear onli requir them for show and to guard against civil
discord but on the other hand thei were as broad as thei were high
built entir of dress stone hewn no doubt from the vast cave
and surround by a great moat about sixti feet in width some reach
of which were still fill with water about ten minut befor the
sun final sank we reach thi moat and pass down and through it
clamber across what evid were the piledup fragment of a great
bridg in order to do so and then with some littl difficulti over the
slope of the wall to it summit i wish that it lai within the power of
my pen to give some idea of the grandeur of the sight that then met our
view there all bath in the red glow of the sink sun were mile
upon mile of ruinscolumn templ shrine and the palac of
king vari with patch of green bush of cours the roof of these
build had long sinc fallen into decai and vanish but ow to
the extrem massiv of the style of build and to the hard
and durabl of the rock emploi most of the parti wall and great
column still remain stand
in connect with the extraordinari state of
preserv of these ruin after so vast a laps of time
at least six thousand yearsit must be rememb that kr
wa not burnt or destroi by an enemi or an earthquak but
desert ow to the action of a terribl plagu
consequ the hous were left unharm also the climat
of the plain is remark fine and dry and there is veri
littl rain or wind as a result of which these relic have
onli to contend against the unaid action of time that
work but slowli upon such massiv block of masonri l
h h
straight befor us stretch awai what had evid been the main
thoroughfar of the citi for it wa veri wide wider than the thame
embank and regular be as we afterward discov pave
or rather built throughout of block of dress stone such as were
emploi in the wall it wa but littl overgrown even now with grass
and shrub that could get no depth of soil to live in what had been the
park and garden on the contrari were now dens jungl inde it
wa easi even from a distanc to trace the cours of the variou road
by the burntup appear of the scanti grass that grew upon them on
either side of thi great thoroughfar were vast block of ruin each
block gener speak be separ from it neighbour by a space
of what had onc i suppos been gardenground but wa now dens and
tangl bush thei were all built of the same colour stone and most
of them had pillar which wa as much as we could make out in the
fade light as we pass swiftli up the main road that i believ i am
right in sai no live foot had press for thousand of year
billali told me that the amahagg believ that the site
of the citi is haunt and could not be persuad to enter
it upon ani consider inde i could see that he
himself did not at all like do so and wa onli consol
by the reflect that he wa under the direct protect of
she it struck leo and myself as veri curiou that a
peopl which ha no object to live amongst the dead
with whom their familiar ha perhap bred contempt and
even us their bodi for purpos of fuel should be
terrifi at approach the habit that these veri
depart had occupi when aliv after all howev it is
onli a savag inconsistencyl h h
present we came to an enorm pile which we rightli took to be a
templ cover at least eight acr of ground and appar arrang
in a seri of court each on enclos anoth of smaller size on
the principl of a chines nest of box the court be separ on
from the other by row of huge column and while i think of it i mai
as well state a remark thing about the shape of these column which
resembl none that i have ever seen or heard of be fashion with a
kind of waist at the centr and swell out abov and below at first
we thought that thi shape wa meant to roughli symbolis or suggest
the femal form as wa a common habit amongst the ancient religi
architect of mani creed on the follow dai howev as we went up
the slope of the mountain we discov a larg quantiti of the most
state look palm of which the truck grew exactli in thi shape
and i have now no doubt but that the first design of those column
drew hi inspir from the grace bend of those veri palm or
rather of their ancestor which then some eight or ten thousand year
ago as now beautifi the slope of the mountain that had onc form
the shore of the volcan lake
at the faad of thi huge templ which i should imagin is almost
as larg as that of elkarnac at thebe some of the largest column
which i measur be between eighteen to twenti feet in diamet at
the base by about seventi feet in height our littl process wa
halt and ayesha descend from her litter
there wa a spot here kallikr she said to leo who had run up to
help her down where on might sleep two thousand year ago did thou
and i and that egyptian asp rest therein but sinc then have i not set
foot here nor ani man and perchanc it ha fallen and follow by
the rest of us she pass up a vast flight of broken and ruin step
into the outer court and look round into the gloom present she
seem to recollect and walk a few pace along the wall to the
left halt
it is here she said and at the same time beckon to the two mute
who were load with provis and our littl belong to advanc
on of them came forward and produc a lamp lit it from hi brazier
for the amahagg when on a journei nearli alwai carri with them a
littl light brazier from which to provid fire the tinder of thi
brazier wa made of broken fragment of mummi carefulli damp and
if the admixtur of moistur wa properli manag thi unholi compound
would smoulder awai for hour as soon as the lamp wa lit we enter
the place befor which ayesha had halt it turn out to be a chamber
hollow in the thick of the wall and from the fact of there still
be a massiv stone tabl in it i should think that it had probabl
serv as a livingroom perhap for on of the doorkeep of the
great templ
after all we ar not much in advanc of the amahagg in
these matter mummi that is pound ancient egyptian
is i believ a pigment much us by artist and
especi by those of them who direct their talent to the
reproduct of the work of the old masterseditor
here we stop and after clean the place out and make it as
comfort as circumst and the dark would permit we at some
cold meat at least leo job and i did for ayesha as i think i have
said elsewher never touch anyth except cake of flour fruit and
water while we were still eat the moon which wa at her full rose
abov the mountainwal and began to flood the place with silver
wot ye why i have brought you here tonight my holli said ayesha
lean her head upon her hand and watch the great orb as she rose
like some heavenli queen abov the solemn pillar of the templ i
brought younai it is strang but knowest thou kallikr that
thou liest at thi moment upon the veri spot where thy dead bodi lai
when i bore thee back to those cave of kr so mani year ago it all
return to my mind now i can see it and horribl is it to my sight
and she shudder
here leo jump up and hastili chang hi seat howev the
reminisc might affect ayesha it clearli had few charm for him
i brought you went on ayesha present that ye might look upon
the most wonder sight that ever the ey of man beheldth full moon
shine over ruin kr when ye have done your eatingi would that i
could teach you to eat naught but fruit kallikr but that will come
after thou hast lave in the fire onc i too at flesh like a brute
beast when ye have done we will go out and i will show you thi great
templ and the god whom men onc worship therein
of cours we got up at onc and start and here again my pen fail
me to give a string of measur and detail of the variou court
of the templ would onli be wearisom suppos that i had them and
yet i know not how i am to describ what we saw magnific as it wa
even in it ruin almost beyond the power of realis court upon dim
court row upon row of mighti pillarssom of them especi at the
gatewai sculptur from pedest to capitalspac upon space of empti
chamber that spoke more eloqu to the imagin than ani crowd
street and over all the dead silenc of the dead the sens of utter
loneli and the brood spirit of the past how beauti it wa
and yet how drear we did not dare to speak aloud ayesha herself wa
aw in the presenc of an antiqu compar to which even her length
of dai wa but a littl thing we onli whisper and our whisper
seem to run from column to column till thei were lost in the quiet
air bright fell the moonlight on pillar and court and shatter wall
hide all their rent and imperfect in it silver garment and
cloth their hoar majesti with the peculiar glori of the night it wa
a wonder sight to see the full moon look down on the ruin fane
of kr it wa a wonder thing to think for how mani thousand of
year the dead orb abov and the dead citi below had gaze thu upon
each other and in the utter solitud of space pour forth each to each
the tale of their lost life and longdepart glori the white
light fell and minut by minut the quiet shadow crept across
the grassgrown court like the spirit of old priest haunt the
habit of their worshipth white light fell and the long shadow
grew till the beauti and grandeur of each scene and the untam majesti
of it present death seem to sink into our veri soul and speak more
loudli than the shout of armi concern the pomp and splendour that
the grave had swallow and even memori had forgotten
come said ayesha after we had gaze and gaze i know not for how
long and i will show you the stoni flower of loveli and wonder
veri crown if yet it stand to mock time with it beauti and fill
the heart of man with long for that which is behind the veil and
without wait for an answer she led us through two more pillar
court into the inner shrine of the old fane
and there in the centr of the inmost court that might have been some
fifti yard squar or a littl more we stood face to face with what
is perhap the grandest allegor work of art that the geniu of her
children ha ever given to the world for in the exact centr of the
court place upon a thick squar slab of rock wa a huge round ball of
dark stone some twenti feet in diamet and stand on the ball wa a
coloss wing figur of a beauti so entranc and divin that when
i first gaze upon it illumin and shadow as it wa by the soft
light of the moon my breath stood still and for an instant my heart
ceas it beat
the statu wa hewn from marbl so pure and white that even now after
all those ag it shone as the moonbeam danc upon it and it height
wa i should sai a trifl over twenti feet it wa the wing figur
of a woman of such marvel loveli and delicaci of form that the
size seem rather to add to than to detract from it so human and yet
more spiritu beauti she wa bend forward and pois herself upon
her halfspread wing as though to preserv her balanc as she leant
her arm were outstretch like those of some woman about to embrac
on she dearli love while her whole attitud gave an impress of
the tenderest beseech her perfect and most graciou form wa nake
saveand here came the extraordinari thingth face which wa thinli
veil so that we could onli trace the mark of her featur a gauzi
veil wa thrown round and about the head and of it two end on fell
down across her left breast which wa outlin beneath it and on now
broken stream awai upon the air behind her
who is she i ask as soon as i could take my ey off the statu
canst thou not guess oh holli answer ayesha where then is thy
imagin it is truth stand on the world and call to it
children to unveil her face see what is writ upon the pedest without
doubt it is taken from the book of scriptur of these men of kr and
she led the wai to the foot of the statu where an inscript of the
usual chineselook hieroglyph wa so deepli graven as to be still
quit legibl at least to ayesha accord to her translat it ran
thu
is there no man that will draw my veil and look upon my face for it is
veri fair unto him who draw my veil shall i be and peac will i give
him and sweet children of knowledg and good work
and a voic cri though all those who seek after thee desir thee
behold virgin art thou and virgin shalt thou go till time be done no
man is there born of woman who mai draw thy veil and live nor shall be
by death onli can thy veil be drawn oh truth
and truth stretch out her arm and wept becaus those who sought her
might not find her nor look upon her face to face
thou seest said ayesha when she had finish translat truth
wa the goddess of the peopl of old kr and to her thei built their
shrine and her thei sought know that thei should never find still
sought thei
and so i ad sadli do men seek to thi veri hour but thei find
out and as thi scriptur saith nor shall thei for in death onli is
truth found
then with on more look at thi veil and spiritualis
lovelinesswhich wa so perfect and so pure that on might almost fanci
that the light of a live spirit shone through the marbl prison to
lead man on to high and ether thoughtsthi poet dream of beauti
frozen into stone which i shall never forget while i live we turn
and went back through the vast moonlit court to the spot whenc we had
start i never saw the statu again which i the more regret becaus
on the great ball of stone repres the world whereon the figur
stood line were drawn that probabl had there been light enough we
should have discov to be a map of the univers as it wa known to
the peopl of kr it is at ani rate suggest of some scientif
knowledg that these longdead worshipp of truth had recognis the
fact that the globe is round
xxiv
walk the plank
next dai the mute woke us befor the dawn and by the time that we had
got the sleep out of our ey and gone through a perfunctori wash at a
spring which still well up into the remain of a marbl basin in the
centr of the north quadrangl of the vast outer court we found she
stand by the litter readi to start while old billali and the two
bearer mute were busi collect the baggag as usual ayesha wa
veil like the marbl truth by the wai i wonder if she origin
got the idea of cover up her beauti from that statu i notic
howev that she seem veri depress and had none of that proud and
buoyant bear which would have betrai her among a thousand women of
the same statur even if thei had been veil like herself she look
up as we camefor her head wa bowedand greet us leo ask her how
she had slept
ill my kallikr she answer ill thi night have strang and
hideou dream come creep through my brain and i know not what thei
mai portend almost do i feel as though some evil overshadow me and
yet how can evil touch me i wonder she went on with a sudden outbreak
of womanli tender i wonder if should aught happen to me so that
i slept awhil and left thee wake thou wouldst think gentli of me i
wonder my kallikr if thou wouldst tarri till i came again as for
so mani centuri i have tarri for thy come
then without wait for an answer she went on come let us be
set forth for we have far to go and befor anoth dai is born in
yonder blue should we stand in the place of life
in five minut we were onc more on our wai through the vast ruin
citi which loom at us on either side in the grei dawn in a wai
that wa at onc grand and oppress just as the first rai of the
rise sun shot like a golden arrow athwart thi stori desol we
gain the further gatewai of the outer wall and have given on more
glanc at the hoar and pillar majesti through which we had journei
and with the except of job for whom ruin had no charm breath
a sigh of regret that we had not had more time to explor it pass
through the great moat and on to the plain beyond
as the sun rose so did ayesha spirit till by breakfasttim thei had
regain their normal level and she laughingli set down her previou
depress to the associ of the spot where she had slept
these barbarian swear that kr is haunt she said and of a truth
i do believ their sai for never did i know so ill a night save on
i rememb it now it wa on that veri spot when thou didst lie dead at
my feet kallikr never will i visit it again it is a place of evil
omen
after a veri brief halt for breakfast we press on with such good will
that by two oclock in the afternoon we were at the foot of the vast
wall of rock that form the lip of the volcano and which at thi point
tower up precipit abov us for fifteen hundr or two thousand
feet here we halt certainli not to my astonish for i did not
see how it wa possibl that we should go ani farther
now said ayesha as she descend from her litter doth our labour
but commenc for here do we part with these men and henceforward must
we bear ourselv and then address billali do thou and these
slave remain here and abid our come by tomorrow at the middai
shall we be with theeif not wait
billali bow humbl and said that her august bid should be obei
if thei stop there till thei grew old
and thi man oh holli said she point to job best is it
that he should tarri also for if hi heart be not high and hi courag
great perchanc some evil might overtak him also the secret of the
place whither we go ar not fit for common ey
i translat thi to job who instantli and earnestli entreat me
almost with tear in hi ey not to leav him behind he said he wa
sure that he could see noth wors than he had alreadi seen and that
he wa terrifi to death at the idea of be left alon with those
dumb folk who he thought would probabl take the opportun to
hotpot him
i translat what he said to ayesha who shrug her shoulder and
answer well let him come it is naught to me on hi own head be
it and he will serv to bear the lamp and thi and she point to a
narrow plank some sixteen feet in length which had been bound abov
the long bearingpol of her hammock as i had thought to make curtain
spread out better but as it now appear for some unknown purpos
connect with our extraordinari undertak
accordingli the plank which though tough wa veri light wa given
to job to carri and also on of the lamp i slung the other on to my
back togeth with a spare jar of oil while leo load himself with
the provis and some water in a kid skin when thi wa done she
bade billali and the six bearer mute to retreat behind a grove of
flower magnolia about a hundr yard awai and remain there under
pain of death till we had vanish thei bow humbl and went and
as he depart old billali gave me a friendli shake of the hand and
whisper that he had rather that it wa i than he who wa go on thi
wonder expedit with shewhomustbeobei and upon my word
i felt inclin to agre with him in anoth minut thei were gone and
then have briefli ask us if we were readi ayesha turn and gaze
up the tower cliff
good me leo i said sure we ar not go to climb that
precipic
leo shrug hi shoulder be in a condit of halffascin
halfexpect mystif and as he did so ayesha with a sudden
move began to climb the cliff and of cours we had to follow her it
wa perfectli marvel to see the eas and grace with which she sprang
from rock to rock and swung herself along the ledg the ascent wa
not howev so difficult as it seem although there were on or two
nasti place where it did not do to look behind you the fact be that
the rock still slope here and wa not absolut precipit as it wa
higher up in thi wai we with no great labour mount to the height
of some fifti feet abov our last standingplac the onli realli
troublesom thing to manag be job board and in do so drew some
fifti or sixti pace to the left of our startingpoint for we went up
like a crab sidewai present we reach a ledg narrow enough at
first but which widen as we follow it and moreov slope inward
like the petal of a flower so that as we follow it we gradual got
into a kind of rut or fold of rock that grew deeper and deeper till at
last it resembl a devonshir lane in stone and hid us perfectli from
the gaze of anybodi on the slope below if there had been anybodi to
gaze thi lane which appear to be a natur format continu
for some fifti or sixti pace and then suddenli end in a cave also
natur run at right angl to it i am sure it wa a natur
cave and not hollow by the hand of man becaus of it irregular and
contort shape and cours which gave it the appear of have been
blown bodili in the mountain by some fright erupt of ga follow
the line of the least resist all the cave hollow by the ancient
of kr on the contrari were cut out with the most perfect regular
and symmetri at the mouth of thi cave ayesha halt and bade us light
the two lamp which i did give on to her and keep the other
myself then take the lead she advanc down the cavern pick her
wai with great care as inde it wa necessari to do for the floor wa
most irregularstrewn with boulder like the bed of a stream and in
some place pit with deep hole in which it would have been easi to
break on leg
thi cavern we pursu for twenti minut or more it be so far as
i could form a judgmentow to it numer twist and turn no easi
taskabout a quarter of a mile long
at last howev we halt at it farther end and whilst i wa still
try to pierc the gloom a great gust of air came tear down it and
extinguish both the lamp
ayesha call to us and we crept up to her for she wa a littl in
front and were reward with a view that wa posit appal in
it gloom and grandeur befor us wa a mighti chasm in the black rock
jag and torn and splinter through it in a far past ag by some
aw convuls of natur as though it had been cleft by stroke upon
stroke of the lightn thi chasm which wa bound by a precipic on
the hither and presum though we could not see it on the farther
side also mai have measur ani width across but from it dark i
do not think it can have been veri broad it wa imposs to make out
much of it outlin or how far it ran for the simpl reason that the
point where we were stand wa so far from the upper surfac of the
cliff at least fifteen hundr or two thousand feet that onli a veri
dim light struggl down to us from abov the mouth of the cavern that
we had been follow gave on to a most curiou and tremend spur
of rock which jut out in mid air into the gulf befor us for
a distanc of some fifti yard come to a sharp point at it
termin and resembl noth that i can think of so much as the
spur upon the leg of a cock in shape thi huge spur wa attach onli
to the parent precipic at it base which wa of cours enorm
just as the cock spur is attach to it leg otherwis it wa utterli
unsupport
here must we pass said ayesha be care lest giddi overcom
you or the wind sweep you into the gulf beneath for of a truth it hath
no bottom and without give us ani further time to get scare she
start walk along the spur leav us to follow her as best we
might i wa next to her then came job painfulli drag hi plank
while leo brought up the rear it wa a wonder sight to see thi
intrepid woman glide fearlessli along that dread place for my
part when i had gone but a veri few yard what between the pressur
of the air and the aw sens of the consequ that a slip would
entail i found it necessari to go down on my hand and knee and crawl
and so did the other two
but ayesha never condescend to thi on she went lean her bodi
against the gust of wind and never seem to lose her head or her
balanc
in a few minut we had cross some twenti pace of thi aw bridg
which got narrow at everi step and then all of a sudden a great gust
came tear along the gorg i saw ayesha lean herself against it but
the strong draught got under her dark cloak and tore it from her and
awai it went down the wind flap like a wound bird it wa dread
to see it go till it wa lost in the black i clung to the saddl
of rock and look round while like a live thing the great spur
vibrat with a hum sound beneath us the sight wa a truli awesom
on there we were pois in the gloom between earth and heaven beneath
us were hundr upon hundr of feet of empti that gradual grew
darker till at last it wa absolut black and at what depth it end
is more than i can guess abov wa space upon space of giddi air and
far far awai a line of blue sky and down thi vast gulf upon which we
were pinnacl the great draught dash and roar drive cloud and
misti wreath of vapour befor it till we were nearli blind and
utterli confus
the whole posit wa so tremend and so absolut unearthli that i
believ it actual lull our sens of terror but to thi hour i often
see it in my dream and at it mere phantasi wake up cover with cold
sweat
on on cri the white form befor us for now the cloak had gone
she wa robe in white and look more like a spirit ride down the
gale than a woman on or ye will fall and be dash to piec keep
your ey fix upon the ground and close hug the rock
we obei her and crept painfulli along the quiver path against
which the wind shriek and wail as it shook it caus it to murmur
like a vast tuningfork on we went i do not know for how long onli
gaze round now and again when it wa absolut necessari until at
last we saw that we were on the veri tip of the spur a slab of rock
littl larger than an ordinari tabl that throb and jump like ani
overengin steamer there we lai cling to the ground and look
about us while ayesha stood lean out against the wind down which
her long hair stream and absolut heedless of the hideou depth
that yawn beneath point befor her then we saw why the narrow
plank had been provid which job and i had painfulli drag along
between us befor us wa an empti space on the other side of which wa
someth as yet we could not see what for hereeith ow to the
shadow of the opposit cliff or from some other causeth gloom wa
that of night
we must wait awhil call ayesha soon there will be light
at the moment i could not imagin what she meant how could more light
than there wa ever come to thi dread spot while i wa still
wonder suddenli like a great sword of flame a beam from the
set sun pierc the stygian gloom and smote upon the point of
rock whereon we lai illumin ayesha love form with an unearthli
splendour i onli wish i could describ the wild and marvel beauti
of that sword of fire laid across the dark and rush mistwreath
of the gulf how it got there i do not to thi moment know but i
presum that there wa some cleft or hole in the oppos cliff through
which it pierc when the set orb wa in a direct line therewith
all i can sai is that the effect wa the most wonder that i ever
saw right through the heart of the dark that flame sword wa
stab and where it lai there wa the most surpassingli vivid light
so vivid that even at a distanc we could see the grain of the rock
while outsid of ity within a few inch of it keen edgewa
naught but cluster shadow
and now by thi rai of light for which she had been wait and
time our arriv to meet know that at thi season for thousand of
year it had alwai struck thu at sunset we saw what wa befor us
within eleven or twelv feet of the veri tip of the tonguelik rock
whereon we stood there aros presum from the far bottom of the
gulf a sugarloafshap cone of which the summit wa exactli opposit
to us but had there been a summit onli it would not have help us
much for the nearest point of it circumfer wa some forti feet
from where we were on the lip of thi summit howev which wa
circular and hollow rest a tremend flat boulder someth like a
glacier stoneperhap it wa on for all i know to the contraryand
the end of thi boulder approach to within twelv feet or so of us
thi huge rock wa noth more or less than a gigant rockingston
accur balanc upon the edg of the cone or miniatur crater like
a halfcrown on the rim of a wineglass for in the fierc light that
plai upon it and us we could see it oscil in the gust of wind
quick said ayesha the plankw must cross while the light endur
present it will be gone
oh lord sir groan job sure she dont mean us to walk across
that there place on that there thing as in obedi to my direct
he push the long board toward me
that it job i halloa in ghastli merriment though the idea of
walk the plank wa no pleasant to me than to him
i push the board on to ayesha who deftli ran it across the gulf so
that on end of it rest on the rockingston the other remain on
the extrem of the trembl spur then place her foot upon it to
prevent it from be blown awai she turn to me
sinc i wa last here oh holli she call the support of the
move stone hath lessen somewhat so that i am not certain if it will
bear our weight or no therefor will i cross the first becaus no
harm will come unto me and without further ado she trod lightli but
firmli across the frail bridg and in anoth second wa stand safe
upon the heav stone
it is safe she call see hold thou the plank i will stand on
the farther side of the stone so that it mai not overbal with your
greater weight now come oh holli for present the light will fail
us
i struggl to my knee and if ever i felt terrifi in my life it wa
then and i am not asham to sai that i hesit and hung back
sure thou art not afraid thi strang creatur call in a lull of
the gale from where she stood pois like a bird on the highest point
of the rockingston make wai then for kallikr
thi settl me it is better to fall down a precipic and die than
be laugh at by such a woman so i clench my teeth and in anoth
instant i wa on that horribl narrow bend plank with bottomless
space beneath and around me i have alwai hate a great height but
never befor did i realis the full horror of which such a posit is
capabl oh the sicken sensat of that yield board rest on
the two move support i grew dizzi and thought that i must fall
my spine crept it seem to me that i wa fall and my delight at
find myself sprawl upon that stone which rose and fell beneath me
like a boat in a swell cannot be express in word all i know is that
briefli but earnestli enough i thank provid for preserv me so
far
then came leo turn and though he look rather queer he came across
like a ropedanc ayesha stretch out her hand to clasp hi own and
i heard her sai brave done my lovebrav done the old greek
spirit live in thee yet
and now onli poor job remain on the farther side of the gulf he crept
up to the plank and yell out i cant do it sir i shall fall into
that beastli place
you must i rememb sai with inappropri facetiousnessy
must job it as easi as catch fli i suppos that i must
have said it to satisfi my conscienc becaus although the express
convei a wonder idea of facil as a matter of fact i know no more
difficult oper in the whole world than catch fliesthat is in
warm weather unless inde it is catch mosquito
i cant siri cant inde
let the man come or let him stop and perish there see the light is
dy in a moment it will be gone said ayesha
i look she wa right the sun wa pass below the level of the hole
or cleft in the precipic through which the rai reach us
if you stop there job you will die alon i call the light is
go
come be a man job roar leo it quit easi
thu adjur the miser job with a most aw yell precipit
himself face downward on the plankh did not dare small blame to
him to try to walk it and commenc to draw himself across in littl
jerk hi poor leg hang down on either side into the nothing
beneath
hi violent jerk at the frail board made the great stone which wa
onli balanc on a few inch of rock oscil in a most dread
manner and to make matter wors when he wa halfwai across the
fly rai of lurid light suddenli went out just as though a lamp
had been extinguish in a curtain room leav the whole howl
wilder of air black with dark
come on job for god sake i shout in an agoni of fear while the
stone gather motion with everi swing rock so violent that it
wa difficult to hang on to it it wa a truli aw posit
lord have merci on me cri poor job from the dark oh the
plank slip and i heard a violent struggl and thought that he
wa gone
but at that moment hi outstretch hand clasp in agoni at the
air met my own and i hauledah how i did haul put out all
the strength that it ha pleas provid to give me in such
abundanceand to my joi in anoth minut job wa gasp on the rock
besid me but the plank i felt it slip and heard it knock against a
project knob of rock and it wa gone
great heaven i exclaim how ar we go to get back
i dont know answer leo out of the gloom suffici to the dai
is the evil thereof i am thank enough to be here
but ayesha mere call to me to take her hand and creep after her
xxv
the spirit of life
i did as i wa bid and in fear and trembl felt myself guid over
the edg of the stone i sprawl my leg out but could touch noth
i am go to fall i gasp
nai let thyself go and trust to me answer ayesha
now if the posit is consid it will be easili understood that
thi wa a greater demand upon my confid than wa justifi by my
knowledg of ayesha charact for all i knew she might be in the veri
act of consign me to a horribl doom but in life we sometim have
to lai our faith upon strang altar and so it wa now
let thyself go she cri and have no choic i did
i felt myself slide a pace or two down the slope surfac of the rock
and then pass into the air and the thought flash through my brain
that i wa lost but no in anoth instant my feet struck against a
rocki floor and i felt that i wa stand upon someth solid and
out of reach of the wind which i could hear sing awai overhead as
i stood there thank heaven for these small merci there wa a slip
and a scuffl and down came leo alongsid of me
hulloa old fellow he call out ar you there thi is get
interest is it not
just then with a terrif yell job arriv right on the top of us
knock us both down by the time we had struggl to our feet again
ayesha wa stand among us and bid us light the lamp which
fortun remain uninjur as also did the spare jar of oil
i got out my box of wax match and thei struck as merrili there in
that aw place as thei could have done in a london drawingroom
in a coupl of minut both the lamp were alight and reveal a curiou
scene we were huddl togeth in a rocki chamber some ten feet
squar and scare enough we look that is except ayesha who wa
stand calmli with her arm fold and wait for the lamp to burn
up the chamber appear to be partli natur and partli hollow out
of the top of the cone the roof of the natur part wa form of the
swing stone and that of the back part of the chamber which slope
downward wa hewn from the live rock for the rest the place wa warm
and drya perfect haven of rest compar to the giddi pinnacl abov
and the quiver spur that shot out to meet it in midair
so said she safe have we come though onc i fear that
the rock stone would fall with you and precipit you into the
bottomless depth beneath for i do believ that the cleft goeth down
to the veri womb of the world the rock whereon the stone resteth hath
crumbl beneath the swing weight and now that he nod toward
job who wa sit on the floor feebli wipe hi forehead with a red
cotton pockethandkerchief whom thei rightli call the pig for as a
pig is he stupid hath let fall the plank it will not be easi to return
across the gulf and to that end must i make a plan but now rest a
while and look upon thi place what think ye that it is
we know not i answer
wouldst thou believ oh holli that onc a man did choos thi airi
nest for a daili habit and did here endur for mani year leav
it onli but on dai in everi twelv to seek food and water and oil that
the peopl brought more than he could carri and laid as an offer in
the mouth of the tunnel through which we pass hither
we look up wonderingli and she continu
yet so it wa there wa a mannoot he name himselfwho though
he live in the latter dai had of the wisdom of the son of kr a
hermit wa he and a philosoph and greatli skill in the secret
of natur and he it wa who discov the fire that i shall show you
which is natur blood and life and also that he who bath therein
and breath thereof should live while natur live but like unto
thee oh holli thi man noot would not turn hi knowledg to account
ill he said wa it for man to live for man wa born to die
therefor did he tell hi secret to none and therefor did he come and
live here where the seeker after life must pass and wa rever of
the amahagg of the dai as holi and a hermit and when first i came to
thi countryknowest thou how i came kallikr anoth time i will
tell thee for it is a strang talei heard of thi philosoph and
wait for him when he came to fetch hi food and return with him
hither though greatli did i fear to tread the gulf then did i beguil
him with my beauti and my wit and flatter him with my tongu so that
he led me down and show me the fire and told me the secret of the
fire but he would not suffer me to step therein and fear lest he
should slai me i refrain know that the man wa veri old and soon
would die and i return have learn from him all that he knew of
the wonder spirit of the world and that wa much for the man
wa wise and veri ancient and by puriti and abstin and the
contempl of hi innoc mind had worn thin the veil between that
which we see and the great invis truth the whisper of whose wing
at time we hear as thei sweep through the gross air of the world
thenit wa but a veri few dai after i met thee my kallikr
who hadst wander hither with the beauti egyptian amenarta and i
learn to love for the first and last time onc and for ever so that
it enter into my mind to come hither with thee and receiv the gift
of life for thee and me therefor came we with that egyptian who would
not be left behind and behold we found the old man noot ly but
newli dead there he lai and hi white beard cover him like a
garment and she point to a spot near where i wa sit but
sure he hath long sinc crumbl into dust and the wind hath born
hi ash henc
here i put out my hand and felt in the dust and present my finger
touch someth it wa a human tooth veri yellow but sound i held
it up and show it to ayesha who laugh
ye she said it is hi without a doubt behold what remaineth of
noot and the wisdom of nooton littl tooth and yet that man had all
life at hi command and for hi conscienc sake would have none of
it well he lai there newli dead and we descend whither i shall lead
you and then gather up all my courag and court death that
i might perchanc win so gloriou a crown of life i step into the
flame and behold life such as ye can never know until ye feel it
also flow into me and i came forth undi and love beyond
imagin then did i stretch out mine arm to thee kallikr
and bid thee take thine immort bride and behold as i spoke thou
blind by my beauti didst turn from me and throw thine arm about the
neck of amenarta and then a great furi fill me and made me mad
and i seiz the javelin that thou didst bear and stab thee so that
there at my veri feet in the place of life thou didst groan and go
down into death i knew not then that i had strength to slai with mine
ey and by the power of my will therefor in my mad slew i with
the javelin
it will be observ that ayesha account of the death
of kallikr differ materi from that written on the
potsherd by amenarta the write on the sherd sai then
in her rage did she smite him by her magic and he di
we never ascertain which wa the correct version but it
will be rememb that the bodi of kallikr had a spear
wound in the breast which seem conclus unless inde
it wa inflict after death anoth thing that we never
ascertain wa how the two womensh and the egyptian
amenartaswer abl to bear the corps of the man thei both
love across the dread gulf and along the shake spur what
a spectacl the two distract creatur must have present
in their grief and loveli as thei toil along that
aw place with the dead man between them probabl howev
the passag wa easier thenl h h
and when thou wast dead ah i wept becaus i wa undi and thou
wast dead i wept there in the place of life so that had i been mortal
ani more my heart had sure broken and she the swart egyptiansh
curs me by her god by osiri did she curs me and by isi by
nephthi and by anubi by sekhet the cathead and by set call
down evil on me evil and everlast desol ah i can see her dark
face now lower oer me like a storm but she could not hurt me and
ii know not if i could hurt her i did not try it wa naught to me
then so togeth we bore thee henc and afterward i sent herth
egyptianawai through the swamp and it seem that she live to bear
a son and to write the tale that should lead thee her husband back to
me her rival and thy murderess
such is the tale my love and now is the hour at hand that shall set
a crown upon it like all thing on the earth it is compound of evil
and of goodmor of evil than of good perchanc and writ in letter
of blood it is the truth naught have i hidden from thee kallikr
and now on thing befor the final moment of thy trial we go down
into the presenc of death for life and death ar veri near togeth
andwho knoweththat might happen which should separ us for
anoth space of wait i am but a woman and no prophetess and i
cannot read the futur but thi i knowfor i learn it from the
lip of the wise man nootthat my life is but prolong and made more
bright it cannot live for ay therefor befor we go tell me oh
kallikr that of a truth thou dost forgiv me and dost love me from
thy heart see kallikr much evil have i doneperch it wa
evil but two night ago to strike that girl who love thee cold in
deathbut she disobei me and anger me prophesi misfortun to
me and i smote be care when power come to thee also lest thou
too shouldst smite in thine anger or thy jealousi for unconquer
strength is a sore weapon in the hand of er man yea i have
sinnedout of the bitter born of a great love have i sinnedbut
yet do i know the good from the evil nor is my heart altogeth
harden thy love kallikr shall be the gate of my redempt
even as aforetim my passion wa the path down which i ran to evil for
deep love unsatisfi is the hell of nobl heart and a portion of the
accurs but love that is mirror back more perfect from the soul of
our desir doth fashion wing to lift us abov ourselv and make us
what we might be therefor kallikr take me by the hand and lift
my veil with no more fear than though i were some peasant girl and not
the wisest and most beauteou woman in thi wide world and look me in
the ey and tell me that thou dost forgiv me with all thine heart
and that will all thine heart thou dost worship me
she paus and the strang tender in her voic seem to hover
round us like a memori i know that the sound of it move me more even
than her word it wa so veri humanso veri womanli leo too wa

henc that all thing mai be accomplish in their order and take
on of the lamp she advanc toward the end of the chamber that wa
roof in by the swai stone where she halt
we follow her and perceiv that in the wall of the cone there wa a
stair or to be more accur that some project knob of rock had
been so shape as to form a good imit of a stair down thi ayesha
began to climb spring from step to step like a chamoi and after
her we follow with less grace when we had descend some fifteen
or sixteen step we found that thei end in a tremend rocki slope
run first outward and then inwardslik the slope of an invert
cone or tunnel the slope wa veri steep and often precipit but
it wa nowher impass and by the light of the lamp we went down it
with no great difficulti though it wa gloomi work enough travel on
thu no on of us knew whither into the dead heart of a volcano as
we went howev i took the precaut of note our rout as well as
i could and thi wa not so veri difficult ow to the extraordinari
and most fantast shape of the rock that were strewn about mani of
which in that dim light look more like the grim face carven upon
mediv gargoyl than ordinari boulder
for a long time we travel on thu half an hour i should sai till
after we had descend for mani hundr of feet i perceiv that we
were reach the point of the invert cone in anoth minut we were
there and found that at the veri apex of the funnel wa a passag so
low and narrow that we had to stoop as we crept along it in indian file
after some fifti yard of thi creep the passag suddenli widen
into a cave so huge that we could see neither the roof nor the side
we onli knew that it wa a cave by the echo of our tread and the perfect
quiet of the heavi air on we went for mani minut in absolut aw
silenc like lost soul in the depth of hade ayesha white and
ghostlik form flit in front of us till onc more the place end
in a passag which open into a second cavern much smaller than the
first inde we could clearli make out the arch and stoni bank of
thi second cave and from their rent and jag appear discov
that like the first long passag down which we had pass through the
cliff befor we reach the quiver spur it had to all appear
been torn in the bowel of the rock by the terrif forc of some
explos ga at length thi cave end in a third passag through
which gleam a faint glow of light
i heard ayesha give a sigh of relief as thi light dawn upon us
it is well she said prepar to enter the veri womb of the earth
wherein she doth conceiv the life that ye see brought forth in man and
beastai and in everi tree and flower
swiftli she sped along and after her we stumbl as best we might our
heart fill like a cup with mingl dread and curios what were we
about to see we pass down the tunnel stronger and stronger the light
beam reach us in great flash like the rai from a lighthous as
on by on thei ar thrown wide upon the dark of the water nor wa
thi all for with the flash came a soulshak sound like that of
thunder and of crash tree now we were through it andoh heaven
we stood in a third cavern some fifti feet in length by perhap as
great a height and thirti wide it wa carpet with fine white sand
and it wall had been worn smooth by the action of i know not what the
cavern wa not dark like the other it wa fill with a soft glow of
rosecolour light more beauti to look on than anyth that can
be conceiv but at first we saw no flash and heard no more of the
thunder sound present howev as we stood in amaz gaze at
the marvel sight and wonder whenc the rosi radianc flow a
dread and beauti thing happen across the far end of the
cavern with a grind and crash noisea nois so dread and
aweinspir that we all trembl and job actual sank to hi
kneesther flame out an aw cloud or pillar of fire like a rainbow
manycolour and like the lightn bright for a space perhap forti
second it flame and roar thu turn slowli round and round and
then by degre the terribl nois ceas and with the fire it pass
awayi know not whereleav behind it the same rosi glow that we had
first seen
draw near draw near cri ayesha with a voic of thrill
exult behold the veri fountain and heart of life as it beat in
the bosom of the great world behold the substanc from which all thing
draw their energi the bright spirit of the globe without which it
cannot live but must grow cold and dead as the dead moon draw near
and wash you in the live flame and take their virtu into your poor
frame in all it virgin strengthnot as it now feebli glow within
your bosom filter thereto through all the fine strainer of a
thousand intermedi live but as it is here in the veri fount and
seat of earthli be
we follow her through the rosi glow up to the head of the cave till
at last we stood befor the spot where the great puls beat and the
great flame pass and as we went we becam sensibl of a wild and
splendid exhilar of a gloriou sens of such a fierc intens of
life that the most buoyant moment of our strength seem flat and tame
and feebl besid it it wa the mere effluvium of the flame the subtl
ether that it cast off as it pass work on us and make us feel
strong as giant and swift as eagl
we reach the head of the cave and gaze at each other in the gloriou
glow and laugh aloudeven job laugh and he had not laugh for a
weekin the light of our heart and the divin intox of our
brain i know that i felt as though all the vari geniu of which the
human intellect is capabl had descend upon me i could have spoken
in blank vers of shakesperian beauti all sort of great idea flash
through my mind it wa as though the bond of my flesh had been
loosen and left the spirit free to soar to the empyrean of it nativ
power the sensat that pour in upon me ar indescrib i seem
to live more keenli to reach to a higher joi and sip the goblet of a
subtler thought than ever it had been my lot to do befor i wa anoth
and most glorifi self and all the avenu of the possibl were for a
space laid open to the footstep of the real

what we saw
then came a few moment paus dure which ayesha seem to be
gather up her strength for the fieri trial while we clung to each
other and wait in utter silenc
at last from far far awai came the first murmur of sound that grew
and grew till it began to crash and bellow in the distanc as she heard
it ayesha swiftli threw off her gauzi wrap loosen the golden
snake from her kirtl and then shake her love hair about her like
a garment beneath it cover slip the kirtl off and replac the
snaki belt around her and outsid the mass of her fall hair there
she stood befor us as ev might have stood befor adam clad in noth
but her abund lock held round her by the golden band and no word
of mine can tell how sweet she lookedand yet how divin nearer and
nearer came the thunderwheel of fire and as thei came she push on
ivori arm through the dark mass of her hair and flung it round leo
neck
oh my love my love she murmur wilt thou ever know how i have
love thee and she kiss him on the forehead and then went and stood
in the pathwai of the flame of life
there wa i rememb to my mind someth veri touch about her
word and that embrac upon the forehead it wa like a mother kiss
and seem to convei a benedict with it
on came the crash roll nois and the sound of it wa as the
sound of a forest be swept flat by a mighti wind and then toss
up like so much grass and thunder down a mountainsid nearer and
nearer it came now flash of light forerunn of the revolv
pillar of flame were pass like arrow through the rosi air and now
the edg of the pillar itself appear ayesha turn toward it and
stretch out her arm to greet it on it came veri slowli and lap
her round with flame i saw the fire run up her form i saw her lift it
with both hand as though it were water and pour it over her head i
even saw her open her mouth and draw it down into her lung and a dread
and wonder sight it wa
then she paus and stretch out her arm and stood there quit
still with a heavenli smile upon her face as though she were the veri
spirit of the flame
the mysteri fire plai up and down her dark and roll lock
twine and twist itself through and around them like thread of
golden lace it gleam upon her ivori breast and shoulder from which
the hair had slip asid it slid along her pillar throat and
delic featur and seem to find a home in the gloriou ey that
shone and shone more brightli even than the spiritu essenc
oh how beauti she look there in the flame no angel out of heaven
could have worn a greater loveli even now my heart faint befor
the recollect of it as she stood and smile at our aw face and
i would give half my remain time upon thi earth to see her onc like
that again
but suddenlymor suddenli than i can describea kind of chang came
over her face a chang which i could not defin or explain but none
the less a chang the smile vanish and in it place there came a
dry hard look the round face seem to grow pinch as though some
great anxieti were leav it impress upon it the gloriou ey too
lost their light and as i thought the form it perfect shape and
erect
i rub my ey think that i wa the victim of some hallucin
or that the refract from the intens light produc an optic
delus and as i did so the flame pillar slowli twist and
thunder off whithersoev it pass to in the bowel of the great
earth leav ayesha stand where it had been
as soon as it wa gone she step forward to leo sideit seem to
me that there wa no spring in her stepand stretch out her hand
to lai it on hi shoulder i gaze at her arm where wa it wonder
round and beauti it wa get thin and angular and her facebi
heavenh face wa grow old befor my ey i suppos that leo
saw it also certainli he recoil a step or two
what is it my kallikr she said and her voicewhat wa the
matter with those deep and thrill note thei were quit high and
crack
why what is itwhat is it she said confusedli i feel daze
sure the qualiti of the fire hath not alter can the principl of
life alter tell me kallikr is there aught wrong with my ey
i see not clear and she put her hand to her head and touch her
hairand oh horror of horrorsit all fell upon the floor
oh looklooklook shriek job in a shrill falsetto of
terror hi ey nearli drop out of hi head and foam upon hi
lip looklooklook she shrivel up she turn into
a monkei and down he fell upon the ground foam and gnash in a
fit
true enoughi faint even as i write it in the live presenc of that
terribl recollectionsh wa shrivel up the golden snake that
had encircl her graciou form slip over her hip and to the ground
smaller and smaller she grew her skin chang colour and in place of
the perfect white of it lustr it turn dirti brown and yellow
like an piec of wither parchment she felt at her head the
delic hand wa noth but a claw now a human talon like that of a
badlypreserv egyptian mummi and then she seem to realis what kind
of chang wa pass over her and she shriekedah she shriekedsh
roll upon the floor and shriek
smaller she grew and smaller yet till she wa no larger than a monkei
now the skin wa pucker into a million wrinkl and on the shapeless
face wa the stamp of unutter ag i never saw anyth like it
nobodi ever saw anyth like the fright ag that wa graven on that
fear counten no bigger now than that of a twomonth child
though the skull remain the same size or nearli so and let all men
prai thei never mai if thei wish to keep their reason
at last she lai still or onli feebli move she who but two minut
befor had gaze upon us the loveliest noblest most splendid woman the
world ha ever seen she lai still befor us near the mass of her own
dark hair no larger than a big monkei and hideousah too hideou for
word and yet think of thisat that veri moment i thought of itit
wa the same woman
she wa dy we saw it and thank godfor while she live she could
feel and what must she have felt she rais herself upon her boni
hand and blindli gaze around her swai her head slowli from side
to side as a tortois doe she could not see for her whitish ey were
cover with a horni film oh the horribl patho of the sight but she
could still speak
kallikr she said in huski trembl note forget me not
kallikr have piti on my shame i shall come again and shall onc
more be beauti i swear itit is true ohhh and she fell
upon her face and wa still
on the veri spot where more than twenti centuri befor she had slain
kallikr the priest she herself fell down and di
i know not how long we remain thu mani hour i suppos when at
last i open my ey the other two were still outstretch upon
the floor the rosi light yet beam like a celesti dawn and the
thunderwheel of the spirit of life yet roll upon their accustom
track for as i awok the great pillar wa pass awai there too lai
the hideou littl monkei frame cover with crinkl yellow parchment
that onc had been the gloriou she ala it wa no hideou dreamit
wa an aw and unparallel fact
what had happen to bring thi shock chang about had the natur
of the lifegiv fire chang did it perhap from time to time send
forth an essenc of death instead of an essenc of life or wa it that
the frame onc charg with it marvel virtu could bear no more
so that were the process repeatedit matter not at what laps of
timeth two impregn neutralis each other and left the bodi
on which thei act as it wa befor it ever came into contact with the
veri essenc of life thi and thi alon would account for the sudden
and terribl ag of ayesha as the whole length of her two thousand
year took effect upon her i have not the slightest doubt myself but
that the frame now ly befor me wa just what the frame of a woman
would be if by ani extraordinari mean life could be preserv in her
till she at length di at the ag of twoandtwenti centuri
but who can tell what had happen there wa the fact often sinc that
aw hour i have reflect that it requir no great imagin to see
the finger of provid in the matter ayesha lock up in her live
tomb wait from ag to ag for the come of her lover work but a
small chang in the order of the world but ayesha strong and happi in
her love cloth in immort youth and goddess beauti and the wisdom
of the centuri would have revolutionis societi and even perchanc
have chang the destini of mankind thu she oppos herself against
the etern law and strong though she wa by it wa swept back to
nothingnessswept back with shame and hideou mockeri
for some minut i lai faintli turn these terror over in my mind
while my physic strength came back to me which it quickli did in that
buoyant atmospher then i bethought me of the other and stagger
to my feet to see if i could arous them but first i took up ayesha
kirtl and the gauzi scarf with which she had been wont to hide her
dazzl loveli from the ey of men and avert my head so that
i might not look upon it cover up that dread relic of the gloriou
dead that shock epitom of human beauti and human life i did thi
hurriedli fear lest leo should recov and see it again
then step over the perfum mass of dark hair that lai upon the
sand i stoop down by job who wa ly upon hi face and turn him
over as i did so hi arm fell back in a wai that i did not like and
which sent a chill through me and i glanc sharpli at him on look
wa enough our old and faith servant wa dead hi nerv alreadi
shatter by all he had seen and undergon had utterli broken down
beneath thi last dire sight and he had di of terror or in a fit
brought on by terror i had onli to look at hi face to see it
it wa anoth blow but perhap it mai help peopl to understand how
overwhelmingli aw wa the experi through which we had passedw
did not feel it much at the time it seem quit natur that the poor
fellow should be dead when leo came to himself which he did with a
groan and trembl of the limb about ten minut afterward and i
told him that job wa dead he mere said oh and mind you thi
wa from no heartless for he and job were much attach to each
other and he often talk of him now with the deepest regret and
affect it wa onli that hi nerv would bear no more a harp can
give out but a certain quantiti of sound howev heavili it is smitten
well i set myself to recov leo who to my infinit relief i
found wa not dead but onli faint and in the end i succeed as i
have said and he sat up and then i saw anoth dread thing when we
enter that aw place hi curl hair had been of the ruddiest gold
now it wa turn grei and by the time we reach the outer air it wa
snow white besid he look twenti year older
what is to be done old fellow he said in a hollow dead sort of
voic when hi mind had clear a littl and a recollect of what
had happen forc itself upon it
try and get out i suppos i answer that is unless you would
like to go in there and i point to the column of fire that wa onc
more roll by
i would go in if i were sure that it would kill me he said with a
littl laugh it wa my curs hesit that did thi if i had not
been doubt she might never have tri to show me the road but i am
not sure the fire might have the opposit effect upon me it might make
me immort and old fellow i have not the patienc to wait a coupl
of thousand year for her to come back again as she did for me i had
rather die when my hour comesand i should fanci that it isnt far off
eitherand go my wai to look for her do you go in if you like
but i mere shook my head my excit wa as dead as ditchwat
and my distast for the prolong of my mortal span had come back
upon me more strongli than ever besid we neither of us knew what the
effect of the fire might be the result upon she had not been of an
encourag natur and of the exact caus that produc that result we
were of cours ignor
well my boi i said we cannot stop here till we go the wai of those
two and i point to the littl heap under the white garment and to
the stif corps of poor job if we ar go we had better go but
by the wai i expect that the lamp have burnt out and i took on up
and look at it and sure enough it had
there is some more oil in the vase said leo indifferentlyif it is
not broken at least
i examin the vessel in questionit wa intact with a trembl
hand i fill the lampsluckili there wa still some of the linen wick
unburnt then i lit them with on of our wax match while i did so
we heard the pillar of fire approach onc more as it went on it
neverend journei if inde it wa the same pillar that pass and
repass in a circl
let see it come onc more said leo we shall never look upon it
like again in thi world
it seem a bit of idl curios but somehow i share it and so we
wait till turn slowli round upon it own axi it had flame and
thunder by and i rememb wonder for how mani thousand of year
thi same phenomenon had been take place in the bowel of the earth
and for how mani more thousand it would continu to take place i
wonder also if ani mortal ey would ever again mark it passag or
ani mortal ear be thrill and fascin by the swell volum of it
majest sound i do not think that thei will i believ that we ar the
last human be who will ever see that unearthli sight present it
had gone and we too turn to go
but befor we did so we each took job cold hand in our and shook it
it wa a rather ghastli ceremoni but it wa the onli mean in our
power of show our respect to the faith dead and of celebr hi
obsequi the heap beneath the white garment we did not uncov we had
no wish to look upon that terribl sight again but we went to the pile
of rippl hair that had fallen from her in the agoni of that hideou
chang which wa wors than a thousand natur death and each of us
drew from it a shine lock and these lock we still have the sole
memento that is left to us of ayesha as we knew her in the ful of
her grace and glori leo press the perfum hair to hi lip
she call to me not to forget her he said hoars and swore that
we should meet again by heaven i never will forget her here i swear
that if we live to get out of thi i will not for all my dai have
anyth to sai to anoth live woman and that wherev i go i will
wait for her as faithfulli as she wait for me
ye i thought to myself if she come back as beauti as we knew
her but suppos she came back like that
what a terrifi reflect it is by the wai that
nearli all our deep love for women who ar not our kindr
dependsat ani rate in the first instanceupon their
person appear if we lost them and found them again
dread to look on though otherwis thei were the veri
same should we still love them l h h
well and then we went we went and left those two in the presenc of
the veri well and spring of life but gather to the cold compani of
death how lone thei look as thei lai there and how ill assort
that littl heap had been for two thousand year the wisest loveliest
proudest creaturei can hardli call her womanin the whole univers
she had been wick too in her wai but ala such is the frailti
of the human heart her wicked had not detract from her charm
inde i am by no mean certain that it did not add to it it wa after
all of a grand order there wa noth mean or small about ayesha
and poor job too hi presenti had come true and there wa an end
of him well he ha a strang burialplaceno norfolk hind ever had a
stranger or ever will and it is someth to lie in the same sepulchr
as the poor remain of the imperi she
we look our last upon them and the indescrib rosi glow in which
thei lai and then with heart far too heavi for word we left them and
crept thenc brokendown menso broken down that we even renounc the
chanc of practic immort life becaus all that made life valuabl
had gone from us and we knew even then that to prolong our dai
indefinit would onli be to prolong our suffer for we felty
both of usthat have onc look ayesha in the ey we could not
forget her for ever and ever while memori and ident remain we
both love her now and for all time she wa stamp and carven on our
heart and no other woman or interest could ever raze that splendid
die and ither li the stingi had and have no right to think thu
of her as she told me i wa naught to her and never shall be through
the unfathom depth of time unless inde condit alter and
a dai come at last when two men mai love on woman and all three be
happi in the fact it is the onli hope of my brokenhearted and a
rather faint on beyond it i have noth i have paid down thi heavi
price all that i am worth here and hereaft and that is my sole
reward with leo it is differ and often and often i bitterli envi
him hi happi lot for if she wa right and her wisdom and knowledg
did not fail her at the last which argu from the preced of her
own case i think most unlik he ha some futur to look forward to
but i have none and yetmark the folli and the weak of the human
heart and let him who is wise learn wisdom from ityet i would not
have it otherwis i mean that i am content to give what i have given
and must alwai give and take in payment those crumb that fall from
my mistresss tabl the memori of a few kind word the hope on dai
in the far undream futur of a sweet smile or two of recognit a
littl gentl friendship and a littl show of thank for my devot to
herand leo
if that doe not constitut true love i do not know what doe and all
i have to sai is that it is a veri bad state of affair for a man on the
wrong side of middl ag to fall into
xxvii
we leap
we pass through the cave without troubl but when we came to the
slope of the invert cone two difficulti stare us in the face the
first of these wa the labori natur of the ascent and the next the
extrem difficulti of find our wai inde had it not been for the
mental note that i had fortun taken of the shape of variou rock
i am sure that we never should have manag it at all but have wander
about in the dread womb of the volcanofor i suppos it must
onc have been someth of the sortuntil we di of exhaust and
despair as it wa we went wrong sever time and onc nearli fell
into a huge crack or crevass it wa terribl work creep about
in the dens gloom and aw still from boulder to boulder
and examin it by the feebl light of the lamp to see if i could
recognis it shape we rare spoke our heart were too heavi
for speech we simpli stumbl about fall sometim and cut
ourselv in a rather dog sort of wai the fact wa that our spirit
were utterli crush and we did not greatli care what happen to us
onli we felt bound to try and save our live whilst we could and inde
a natur instinct prompt us to it so for some three or four hour
i should thinki cannot tell exactli how long for we had no watch
left that would gow blunder on dure the last two hour we were
complet lost and i began to fear that we had got into the funnel of
some subsidiari cone when at last i suddenli recognis a veri larg
rock which we had pass in descend but a littl wai from the top
it is a marvel that i should have recognis it and inde we
had alreadi pass it go at right angl to the proper path when
someth about it struck me and i turn back and examin it in an
idl sort of wai and as it happen thi prove our salvat
after thi we gain the rocki natur stair without much further
troubl and in due cours found ourselv back in the littl chamber
where the benight noot had live and di
but now a fresh terror stare us in the face it will be rememb that
ow to job fear and awkward the plank upon which we had cross
from the huge spur to the rockingston had been whirl off into the
tremend gulf below
how were we to cross without the plank
there wa onli on answerw must try and jump it or els stop there
till we starv the distanc in itself wa not so veri great between
eleven and twelv feet i should think and i have seen leo jump over
twenti when he wa a young fellow at collag but then think of the
condit two weari wornout men on of them on the wrong side of
forti a rockingston to take off from a trembl point of rock some
few feet across to land upon and a bottomless gulf to be clear in a
rage gale it wa bad enough god know but when i point out these
thing to leo he put the whole matter in a nutshel by repli that
merciless as the choic wa we must choos between the certainti of a
linger death in the chamber and the risk of a swift on in the air
of cours there wa no argu against thi but on thing wa clear
we could not attempt that leap in the dark the onli thing to do wa to
wait for the rai of light which pierc through the gulf at sunset
how near to or how far from sunset we might be neither of us had the
faintest notion all we did know wa that when at last the light came
it would not endur more than a coupl of minut at the outsid so
that we must be prepar to meet it accordingli we made up our mind
to creep on to the top of the rockingston and lie there in readi
we were the more easili reconcil to thi cours by the fact that our
lamp were onc more nearli exhaustedinde on had gone out bodili
and the other wa jump up and down as the flame of a lamp doe when
the oil is done so by the aid of it dy light we hasten to crawl
out of the littl chamber and clamber up the side of the great stone
as we did so the light went out
the differ in our posit wa a suffici remark on
below in the littl chamber we had onli heard the roar of the
gale overheadher ly on our face on the swing stone we were
expos to it full forc and furi as the great draught drew first from
thi direct and then from that howl against the mighti precipic
and through the rocki cliff like ten thousand despair soul we lai
there hour after hour in terror and miseri of mind so deep that i will
not attempt to describ it and listen to the wild stormvoic
of that tartaru as set to the deep underton of the spur opposit
against which the wind hum like some aw harp thei call to each
other from precipic to precipic no nightmar dream by man no wild
invent of the romanc can ever equal the live horror of that
place and the weird cry of those voic of the night as we clung
like shipwreck marin to a raft and toss on the black unfathom
wilder of air fortun the temperatur wa not a low on
inde the wind wa warm or we should have perish so we clung and
listen and while we were stretch out upon the rock a thing happen
which wa so curiou and suggest in itself though doubtless a mere
coincid that if anyth it ad to rather than deduct from
the burden on our nerv
it will be rememb that when ayesha wa stand on the spur befor
we cross to the stone the wind tore her cloak from her and whirl
it awai into the dark of the gulf we could not see whither welli
hardli like to tell the stori it is so strang as we lai there upon
the rockingston thi veri cloak came float out of the black space
like a memori from the dead and fell on leoso that it cover him
nearli from head to foot we could not at first make out what it wa
but soon discov by it feel and then poor leo for the first time
gave wai and i heard him sob there upon the stone no doubt the
cloak had been caught upon some pinnacl of the cliff and wa thenc
blown hither by a chanc gust but still it wa a most curiou and
touch incid
shortli after thi suddenli without the slightest previou warn
the great red knife of light came stab the dark through and
throughstruck the swai stone on which we were and rest it sharp
point upon the spur opposit
now for it said leo now or never
we rose and stretch ourselv and look at the cloudwreath stain
the colour of blood by that red rai as thei tore through the sicken
depth beneath and then at the empti space between the swai stone
and the quiver rock and in our heart despair and prepar for
death sure we could not clear itdesper though we were
who is to go first said i
do you old fellow answer leo i will sit upon the other side of
the stone to steadi it you must take as much run as you can and jump
high and god have merci on us sai i
i acquiesc with a nod and then i did a thing i had never done sinc
leo wa a littl boi i turn and put my arm round him and kiss him
on the forehead it sound rather french but as a fact i wa take my
last farewel of a man whom i could not have love more if he had been
my own son twice over
goodby my boi i said i hope that we shall meet again wherev
it is that we go to
the fact wa i did not expect to live anoth two minut
next i retreat to the far side of the rock and wait till on of the
chop gust of wind got behind me and then i ran the length of the
huge stone some three or four and thirti feet and sprang wildli out
into the dizzi air oh the sicken terror that i felt as i launch
myself at that littl point of rock and the horribl sens of despair
that shot through my brain as i realis that i had jump short but
so it wa my feet never touch the point thei went down into space
onli my hand and bodi came in contact with it i grip at it with
a yell but on hand slip and i swung right round hold by the
other so that i face the stone from which i had sprung wildli i
stretch up with my left hand and thi time manag to grasp a knob of
rock and there i hung in the fierc red light with thousand of feet
of empti air beneath me my hand were hold to either side of
the under part of the spur so that it point wa touch my head
therefor even if i could have found the strength i could not pull
myself up the most that i could do would be to hang for about a minut
and then drop down down into the bottomless pit if ani man can imagin
a more hideou posit let him speak all i know is that the tortur
of that halfminut nearli turn my brain
i heard leo give a cry and then suddenli saw him in mid air spring
up and out like a chamoi it wa a splendid leap that he took under the
influenc of hi terror and despair clear the horribl gulf as if it
were noth and land well on to the rocki point he threw himself
upon hi face to prevent hi pitch off into the depth i felt the
spur abov me shake beneath the shock of hi impact and as it did so i
saw the huge rockingston that had been violent depress by him as
he sprang fly back when reliev of hi weight till for the first time
dure all these centuri it got beyond it balanc fell with a
most aw crash right into the rocki chamber which had onc serv the
philosoph noot for a hermitag and i have no doubt for ever seal
the passag that lead to the place of life with some hundr of ton
of rock
all thi happen in a second and curious enough notwithstand my
terribl posit i note it involuntarili as it were i even rememb
think that no human be would go down that dread path again
next instant i felt leo seiz me by the right wrist with both hand by
ly flat on the point of rock he could just reach me
you must let go and swing yourself clear he said in a calm and
collect voic and then i will try and pull you up or we will both
go togeth ar you readi
by wai of answer i let go first with my left hand and then with the
right and as a consequ swai out clear of the overshadow
rock my weight hang upon leo arm it wa a dread moment he
wa a veri power man i knew but would hi strength be equal to
lift me up till i could get a hold on the top of the spur when ow
to hi posit he had so littl purchas
for a few second i swung to and fro while he gather himself for the
effort and then i heard hi sinew crack abov me and felt myself
lift up as though i were a littl child till i got my left arm round
the rock and my chest wa rest on it the rest wa easi in two or
three more second i wa up and we were ly pant side by side
trembl like leav and with the cold perspir of terror pour
from our skin
and then as befor the light went out like a lamp
for some halfhour we lai thu without speak a word and then at
length began to creep along the great spur as best we might in the dens
gloom as we drew toward the face of the cliff howev from which the
spur sprang out like a spike from a wall the light increas though
onli a veri littl for it wa night overhead after that the gust of
wind decreas and we got along rather better and at last reach the
mouth of the first cave or tunnel but now a fresh troubl stare as
in the face our oil wa gone and the lamp were no doubt crush to
powder beneath the fallen rockingston we were even without a drop of
water to stai our thirst for we had drunk the last in the chamber
of noot how were we to see to make our wai through thi last
boulderstrewn tunnel
clearli all that we could do wa to trust to our sens of feel and
attempt the passag in the dark so in we crept fear that if
we delai to do so our exhaust would overcom us and we should
probabl lie down and die where we were
oh the horror of that last tunnel the place wa strewn with rock
and we fell over them and knock ourselv up against them till we
were bleed from a score of wound our onli guid wa the side of
the cavern which we kept touch and so bewild did we grow in the
dark that we were sever time seiz with the terrifi thought
that we had turn and were travel the wrong wai on we went
feebli and still more feebli for hour after hour stop everi few
minut to rest for our strength wa spent onc we fell asleep and i
think must have slept for some hour for when we woke our limb were
quit stiff and the blood from our blow and scratch had cake and
wa hard and dry upon our skin then we drag ourselv on again till
at last when despair wa enter into our heart we onc more saw the
light of dai and found ourselv outsid the tunnel in the rocki fold
on the outer surfac of the cliff that it will be rememb led into
it
it wa earli morningthat we could tell by the feel of the sweet air
and the look of the bless sky which we had never hope to see again
it wa so near as we knew an hour after sunset when we enter the
tunnel so it follow that it had taken us the entir night to crawl
through that dread place
on more effort leo i gasp and we shall reach the slope where
billali is if he hasnt gone come dont give wai for he had cast
himself upon hi face he rose and lean on each other we got down
that fifti feet or so of cliffsomehow i have not the least notion
how i onli rememb that we found ourselv ly in a heap at the
bottom and then onc more began to drag ourselv along on our hand
and knee toward the grove where she had told billali to wait her
rearriv for we could not walk anoth foot we had not gone fifti
yard in thi fashion when suddenli on of the mute emerg from
the tree on our left through which i presum he had been take a
morn stroll and came run up to see what sort of strang anim
we were he stare and stare and then held up hi hand in horror
and nearli fell to the ground next he start off as hard as he
could for the grove some two hundr yard awai no wonder that he wa
horrifi at our appear for we must have been a shock sight
to begin leo with hi golden curl turn a snowi white hi cloth
nearli rent from hi bodi hi worn face and hi hand a mass of
bruis cut and bloodencrust filth wa a suffici alarm
spectacl as he painfulli drag himself along the ground and i
have no doubt that i wa littl better to look on i know that two dai
afterward when i inspect my face in some water i scarc recognis
myself i have never been famou for beauti but there wa someth
besid ugli stamp upon my featur that i have never got rid
of until thi dai someth resembl that wild look with which a
startl person wake from deep sleep more than anyth els that i can
think of and realli it is not to be wonder at what i do wonder at is
that we escap at all with our reason
present to my intens relief i saw old billali hurri toward
us and even then i could scarc help smile at the express of
constern on hi dignifi counten
oh my baboon my baboon he cri my dear son is it inde thee
and the lion why hi mane that wa ripe as corn is white like
the snow whenc come ye and where is the pig and where too
shewhomustbeobei
dead both dead i answer but ask no question help us and give
us food and water or we too shall die befor thine ey seest thou not
that our tongu ar black for want of water how then can we talk
dead he gasp imposs she who never diesdead how can it
be and then perceiv i think that hi face wa be watch by
the mute who had come run up he check himself and motion to
them to carri us to the camp which thei did
fortun when we arriv some broth wa boil on the fire and with
thi billali fed us for we were too weak to feed ourselv therebi
i firmli believ save us from death by exhaust then he bade the
mute wash the blood and grime from us with wet cloth and after that
we were laid down upon pile of aromat grass and instantli fell into
the dead sleep of absolut exhaust of mind and bodi
xxviii
over the mountain
the next thing i recollect is a feel of the most dread stiff
and a sort of vagu idea pass through my halfawaken brain that i
wa a carpet that had just been beaten i open my ey and the first
thing thei fell on wa the vener counten of our old friend
billali who wa seat by the side of the improvis bed upon which i
wa sleep and thoughtfulli stroke hi long beard the sight of
him at onc brought back to my mind a recollect of all that we had
recent pass through which wa accentu by the vision of poor
leo ly opposit to me hi face knock almost to a jelli and hi
beauti crowd of curl turn from yellow to white and i shut my
ey again and groan
curious enough leo hair ha late been to some
extent regain it colourthat is to sai it is now a
yellowish grei and i am not without hope that it will in
time come quit rightl h h
thou hast slept long my baboon said old billali
how long my father i ask
a round of the sun and a round of the moon a dai and a night hast thou
slept and the lion also see he sleepeth yet
bless is sleep i answer for it swallow up recollect
tell me he said what hath befallen you and what is thi strang
stori of the death of her who dieth not bethink thee my son if thi
be true then is thy danger and the danger of the lion veri greatnai
almost is the pot red wherewith ye shall be pot and the stomach of
those who shall eat ye ar alreadi hungri for the feast knowest thou
not that these amahagg my children these dweller in the cave
hate ye thei hate ye as stranger thei hate ye more becaus of their
brethren whom she put to the torment for your sake assuredli if onc
thei learn that there is naught to fear from hiya from the terribl
onewhomustbeobei thei will slai ye by the pot but let me hear
thy tale my poor baboon
thi adjur i set to work and told himnot everyth inde for
i did not think it desir to do so but suffici for my purpos
which wa to make him understand that she wa realli no more have
fallen into some fire and as i put itfor the real thing would have
been incomprehens to himbeen burnt up i also told him some of the
horror we had undergon in effect our escap and these produc a
great impress on him but i clearli saw that he did not believ in
the report of ayesha death he believ inde that we thought
that she wa dead but hi explan wa that it had suit her to
disappear for a while onc he said in hi father time she had done
so for twelv year and there wa a tradit in the countri that mani
centuri back no on had seen her for a whole gener when she
suddenli reappear and destroi a woman who had assum the posit
of queen i said noth to thi but onli shook my head sadli ala
i knew too well that ayesha would appear no more or at ani rate that
billali would never see her again
and now conclud billali what wouldst thou do my baboon
nai i said i know not my father can we not escap from thi
countri
he shook hi head
it is veri difficult by kr ye cannot pass for ye would be seen
and as soon as those fierc on found that ye were alon well and
he smile significantli and made a movement as though he were place a
hat on hi head but there is a wai over the cliff whereof i onc spake
to thee where thei drive the cattl out to pastur then beyond the
pastur ar three dai journei through the marsh and after that
i know not but i have heard that seven dai journei from thenc is
a mighti river which floweth to the black water if ye could come
thither perchanc ye might escap but how can ye come thither
billali i said onc thou knowest i did save thy life now pai
back the debt my father and save me mine and my friend the lion
it shall be a pleasant thing for thee to think of when thine hour come
and someth to set in the scale against the evil do of thy dai if
perchanc thou hast done ani evil also if thou be right and if she
doth but hide herself sure when she come again she shall reward
thee
my son the baboon answer the old man think not that i have an
ungrat heart well do i rememb how thou didst rescu me when those
dog stood by to see me drown measur for measur will i give thee
and if thou canst be save sure i will save thee listen by dawn
tomorrow be prepar for litter shall be here to bear ye awai across
the mountain and through the marsh beyond thi will i do sai
that it is the word of she that it be done and he who obeyeth not the
word of she food is he for the hyna then when ye have cross the
marsh ye must strike with your own hand so that perchanc if good
fortun go with you ye mai live to come to that black water whereof ye
told me and now see the lion wake and ye must eat the food i have
made readi for you
leo condit when onc he wa fairli arous prove not to be so
bad as might have been expect from hi appear and we both of us
manag to eat a hearti meal which inde we need sadli enough after
thi we limp down to the spring and bath and then came back and
slept again till even when we onc more at enough for five billali
wa awai all that dai no doubt make arrang about litter and
bearer for we were awaken in the middl of the night by the arriv
of a consider number of men in the littl camp
at dawn the old man himself appear and told us that he had by us
she dread name though with some difficulti succeed in get
the necessari men and two guid to conduct us across the swamp and
that he urg us to start at onc at the same time announc hi
intent of accompani us so as to protect us against treacheri i
wa much touch by thi act of kind on the part of that wili old
barbarian toward two utterli defenceless stranger a threeor in
hi case for he would have to return sixdai journei through those
deadli swamp wa no light undertak for a man of hi ag but he
consent to do it cheerfulli in order to promot our safeti it show
that even among those dread amahaggerwho ar certainli with their
gloom and their devilish and feroci rite by far the most terribl
savag that i ever heard ofther ar peopl with kindli heart of
cours selfinterest mai have had someth to do with it he mai have
thought that she would suddenli reappear and demand an account of us
at hi hand but still allow for all deduct it wa a great
deal more than we could expect under the circumst and i can onli
sai that i shall for as long as i live cherish a most affection
remembr of my nomin parent old billali
accordingli after swallow some food we start in the litter
feel so far as our bodi went wonderfulli like our old selv
after our long rest and sleep i must leav the condit of our mind
to the imagin
then came a terribl pull up the cliff sometim the ascent wa more
natur more often it wa a zigzag roadwai cut no doubt in the first
instanc by the old inhabit of kr the amahagg sai thei drive
their spare cattl over it onc a year to pastur outsid all i know is
that those cattl must be uncommonli activ on their feet of cours the
litter were useless here so we had to walk
by middai howev we reach the great flat top of that mighti wall of
rock and grand enough the view wa from it with the plain of kr in
the centr of which we could clearli make out the pillar ruin of the
templ of truth to the on side and the boundless and melancholi marsh
on the other thi wall of rock which had no doubt onc form the lip
of the crater wa about a mile and a half thick and still cover with
clinker noth grew there and the onli thing to reliev our ey were
occasion pool of rainwat for rain had late fallen wherev
there wa a littl hollow over the flat crest of thi mighti rampart we
went and then came the descent which if not so difficult a matter
as the get up wa still suffici breakneck and took us till
sunset that night howev we camp in safeti upon the mighti slope
that roll awai to the marsh beneath
on the follow morn about eleven oclock began our dreari journei
across those aw sea of swamp which i have alreadi describ
for three whole dai through stench and mire and the allprevail
flavour of fear did our bearer struggl along till at length we came
to open roll ground quit uncultiv and mostli treeless but
cover with game of all sort which li beyond that most desol
and without guid utterli impractic district and here on the
follow morn we bade farewel not without some regret to old
billali who stroke hi white beard and solemnli bless us
farewel my son the baboon he said and farewel to thee too oh
lion i can do no more to help you but if ever ye come to your countri
be advis and ventur no more into land that ye know not lest ye
come back no more but leav your white bone to mark the limit of your
journei farewel onc more often shall i think of you nor wilt
thou forget me my baboon for though thy face is ugli thy heart is
true and then he turn and went and with him went the tall and
sullenlook bearer and that wa the last that we saw of the
amahagg we watch them wind awai with the empti litter like a
process bear dead men from a battl till the mist from the marsh
gather round them and hid them and then left utterli desol in the
vast wilder we turn and gaze round us and at each other
three week or so befor four men had enter the marsh of kr and
now two of us were dead and the other two had gone through adventur
and experi so strang and terribl that death himself hath not a
more fear counten three weeksand onli three week truli time
should be measur by event and not by the laps of hour it seem
like thirti year sinc we saw the last of our whaleboat
we must strike out for the zambesi leo i said but god know if we
shall ever get there
leo nod he had becom veri silent of late and we start with
noth but the cloth we stood in a compass our revolv and
express rifl and about two hundr round of ammunit and so end
the histori of our visit to the ancient ruin of mighti and imperi
kr
as for the adventur that subsequ befel us strang and vari
as thei were i have after deliber determin not to record them
here in these page i have onli tri to give a short and clear account
of an occurr which i believ to be unpreced and thi i have
done not with a view to immedi public but mere to put
on paper while thei ar yet fresh in our memori the detail of our
journei and it result which will i believ prove interest to
the world if ever we determin to make them public thi as at present
advis we do not intend should be done dure our joint live
for the rest it is of no public interest resembl as it doe the
experi of more than on central african travel suffic it to
sai that we did after incred hardship and privat reach the
zambesi which prove to be about a hundr and seventi mile south
of where billali left us there we were for six month imprison by
a savag tribe who believ us to be supernatur be chiefli on
account of leo youth face and snowwhit hair from these peopl we
ultim escap and cross the zambesi wander off southward
where when on the point of starvat we were suffici fortun
to fall in with a halfcast portugues elephanthunt who had follow
a troop of eleph farther inland than he had ever been befor thi
man treat us most hospit and ultim through hi assist
we after innumer suffer and adventur reach delagoa bai
more than eighteen month from the time when we emerg from the marsh
of kr and the veri next dai manag to catch on of the steamboat
that run round the cape to england our journei home wa a prosper
on and we set our foot on the quai at southampton exactli two year
from the date of our departur upon our wild and seemingli ridicul
quest and i now write these last word with leo lean over my
shoulder in my old room in my colleg the veri same into which some
twoandtwenti year ago my poor friend vincei came stumbl on the
memor night of hi death bear the iron chest with him
and that is the end of thi histori so far as it concern scienc and
the outsid world what it end will be as regard leo and myself is
more than i can guess at but we feel that is not reach yet a stori
that began more than two thousand year ago mai stretch a long wai into
the dim and distant futur
is leo realli a reincarn of the ancient kallikr of whom the
inscript tell or wa ayesha deceiv by some strang hereditari
resembl the reader must form hi own opinion on thi as on mani
other matter i have mine which is that she made no such mistak
often i sit alon at night stare with the ey of the mind into the
black of unborn time and wonder in what shape and form the great
drama will be final develop and where the scene of it next act
will be laid and when that final develop ultim occur as i
have no doubt it must and will occur in obedi to a fate that never
swerv and a purpos that cannot be alter what will be the part
plai therein by that beauti egyptian amenarta the princess of the
royal race of the pharaoh for the love of whom the priest kallikr
